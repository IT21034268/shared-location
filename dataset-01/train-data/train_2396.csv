2,not the right zone!,couldn't watch it on my DVD player but it was OK at work so it made things difficult for me.Hope it won't happen again...CB
1,pointless,"Boring, insensitive, pointless movie, that wants to be a slow, artsy movie...it is just senseless. completely waste of time"
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no character developmet, no interesting dialog, no plot, nothing. It just plain sucks. It is filled with 10 minute long shots of people just walking. I know people walk. I don't want to pay to see them do it. Then, I see 2 guys with lots of guns named Eric and Alex, just like the Columbine shooters, and I figure, 'Oh, this is about Columbine'. But by the time the 2 kids go on the shooting spree, I'm so bored that I want them to shoot everyone. Shoot the director too. Put this piece of @#$% out of its misery."
1,"Definition of ""inane"" and ""waste""","This movie is inane, bad, boring, etc... I could feel my IQ drop as I watched it. This movie has no redeeming value whatsoever. Keep in mind this was directed by the same ""brilliant"" director who remade ""Psycho."" You will kick yourself if you waste any time watching this. This film is not ""artsy"", ""brilliant"" or another positive adjective."
2,"""Elephant"" bothered me.","As much as I appreciated Van Sant's film about how lives intertwine, every student has a story, and you never really know the lives of other people unless you live them, ""Elephant"" bothered me. Having studied Columbine extensively for a term paper, the film was too similar to the events at Columbine to be a coincidence and not factual enough to be accurate."
3,A film with integrity but a surprising lack of emotion,"The basic premise: two students go on a shooting spree at their local high school, leaving a trail of death behind them. Comparisons to Columbine are inevitable, of course.But what I found most disturbing about this movie were the unexplored questions. There is no evidence these boys are disturbed and few hints as to what might have caused them to become so unhinged. The movie seems almost mechanical and detached, filming everything in a documentary style but with no explication.Other flaws - a very slow build-up to the inevitable conclusion, no depth to the characters, a certain choppiness.Even so, I confess I was unable to turn away from the screen, knowing what was to happen..but I also wanted to have some hint as to WHY it happened."
4,Deceptively Calm And Quiet...,"ELEPHANT illustrates how a hideous, tragic event can explode, seemingly out of nowhere w/ no warning. However, it also shows that clues do exist, if anyone takes the time / effort to find and decipher them. The vast majority of the film is filled w/ the deadening, institutional dullness of a typical high school day. We get glimpses and snippets of students, as they move here and there, gossiping, joking, and sometimes bullying those deemed unworthy of common decency. In other words, it's business as usual. That is until two young men are revealed to be the coming storm that will leave nothing untouched by horror and violence. I believe that everyone in high school should see this, along w/ ZERO DAY and BANG BANG YOU'RE DEAD, at least once..."
3,It was Ok,I just saw this movie today and after watching the 80 minute film i came to realize that it was only Average if not a little below Average it was a movie with few words....it surrounds lifes of different teens in different social classes.... from what i pointed out Punk Rocker (Blonde Hair Kid) Casual Average Joe (Photographer) A Jock (Guy With The Lifeguard Sweater) Outkast Insecure Girl (Curly Headed Girl) and of course Eric the boy that gets picked on that finally decides to get his best friend and do a school shoot-out........it was ok but there really wasnt any substance i really can't say i would watch this film again but thats why i rented it
1,1 star out of 4,"The Bottom Line:With a complete lack of characterization, unbelievably pretentious direction (Van Zant uses so many long takes that I found myself looking forward to cuts) and some of the slowest pacing imaginable (in an 81 minute movie no less), Elephant is one of the most overrated movies I can name."
4,The sound of unsettling,"This film is an appaling yet accurate portrayal of the average high school: popularity is run by cliques and gossip can be spread like wildfire. Although I am an 8th grade student, I was able to compare what I have experienced to what Eric or Michelle felt as social outcasts.As the story unravels with each character intertwining and acting as a parallel to other students, you realize how one person feels and how it counteracts to a chain reaction, such as the one day Eric is pelted with spitballs, and later is casually looking through a gun catalogue.I felt this movie was able to show that not always the media influences students, but student pressure and the capsizing of self-esteem can contribute to a fatal life. ****I would recommend this movie moreso to mature high school students to college students."
4,An unforgettable bittersweet dramatization of a tragedy,"I saw this movie in the theatres as an afternoon out and I've never been so taken ""back to what it was like to be a teenager in high school"" since Brian depalma's ""Carrie"".The film ""Elephant"" is based on a true incident {The Columbine School murders}Such fine direction with beautiful cinematography. The movie actually takes you back to this particularly ""tragic"" day in history. Such a miraculous transformation for a filmmaker to achieve.Gus blew my mind with ""Psycho"" with its {frame to frame take}. Once again ""Elephant"", does it with mood of characters and cinematographic choreographic atmosphere. The actors are beautiful and ""Right On"".The awards it recieved were well deserved.Watch it alone or with someone you love.You will not be disappointed."
3,bad movie done nicely,"this movie is really boring, full of ordinarily cheesy highschool kids doing stupid stuff like 3 girls doing synchronized puking, vomiting out their 30 second lunch, and 2 killer guys showering together the morning of their rampage saying while showering ""i've never even kissed a girl before"", then kising the other dude. the ending was pretty interesting and entertaining in a repulsive way. the killers were filmed murdering in videogame perspective. i cant see why i would ever consider anyone wanting to watch this movie more than once. the director and all involved did do an awesome job with all aspects of the movie, but a believable movie about school shootings is just a real bad recipe for a dvd worth buying."
1,What a waste of time.,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have seen in the last 3 years or so. The story evolves around two gay teens who order guns over the internet and then go shoot the kids at their school. One of them plays piano and the other plays a fake FPS on his laptop as if to insinuate that that is the reason for their outlandish behavior. About 60 minutes of the movie is very weak character development that has no relevance to anything in the conclusion. There really was no point in making this movie at all, the actors were terrible and the script was bland. If you have an hour to waste I still wouldn't recommend seeing this film. On a similar level of comparison to.....Gigli?"
1,Some well-done footage but an empty shell of a movie.,"What a stupid movie. Yes, it shocked, horrified, and disgusted me. Bravo, director. But then, I am easily shocked and I was making up character emotion and dialogue in my head to fill in all the silences - giving the kids more depth than you (the director) would have us believe they possessed.Ultimately it was a movie devoid of hope - and you expect us to believe that was the way it really went down. Bleak realism at its most soul-destroying.But...1) Those two movie killers shot down a hell of a lot more kids than the real ones did. Was that sicko wishful thinking on your part?2) I seem to remember a girl saying yes, she believed in God - at gunpoint.I notice you didn't bother including that scene.Nice try though."
2,Left me utterly empty,"I agree with many of the positive things said about this movie: it is beautifully done and very well-directed. The movie doesn't bother to explain one way or another - you will take whatever you desire as an explanation for the senseless violence of the film. For me, this was just simply not enough. For a movie loosely based on the Columbine shooting, I want perspective, a view which will provoke discussion, an actual interpretation of the event itself. But merely a protrayal, and an utterly hollow one at that? The movie just left me feeling empty. Not sad, angry, or frusterated - just empty."
1,Great idea ... Bad Movie,"I'm not sure if the Directors movies are all like this but if they are I would never watch another one. The characters are stereotypical. The nerd, the jock, the pretty girls and don't forget the artsy guy. If that's not bad enough, the way he portays them makes it so you don't feel emotionally attached to the characters. For the first half of the movie, your wondering what's going on and when the movie ends, your still waiting for something big to happen.It was a great idea for a movie, especially with what has happened over the years, but this was just horribly made."
1,Just Shoot Me,"This movie should be called ""people walking down hallways and mumbling."" By 45 minutes into the movie, you long for the killers to get on with it. And why is it that no one in this school carries any books?WARNING SPOILER AHEADThey shoot some people in the end."
1,only rating it 1 star cuz amazon will not let you rate lower,"Ive seen my share of bad movies and this takes the cake. This movie is an hour and ten minutes of character development (and not much development might I add) and twenty minutes of so-so plot.There are scenes that provide no advancement to the story at all. Some scenes are played two or three times from different angles, but not really giving the viewer any real different perspective.Gus you owe me an Hour and a half of my life back!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Boring, Zero Insight","If you want to watch 2 boring hours of kids walking hallways in a highschool where everyone looks like they shop at Abercrombie & Fitch with no character development or any insight into the killer's minds, this one is for you. I swear the whole movie is kids walking the halls, a kid playing a piano for 10 minutes, 5 minutes of kids getting randomly shot. Thats it. Boring and pointless. I like independent films by the way. I am not a strictly T3 or Matrix guy. This movie just plain (isn't good)!!"
2,What was the point?,"After reading the rave reviews this movie received from critics, including the Cannes Film Festival, I had high expectations. I was left with a feeling of pointlessness. I understand that the movie was trying to depict the occurrences as a real life event that is very anti-climatic due to the distance one places between themselves and the world around them. However, if van Sant was not going for shock value there are a few discrepancies I have with this movie. If the goal of this movie was not to shock then why the pointless scenes such as the girls going into the bathroom and regurgitating or the two boys making out in the shower? These scenes, I believe were not necessary to the plot of the movie and seemed as lame attempts to ""rawly"" portray a sensitive issue just to do it. I did like the anticlimactic aspect of the shootings but there was no substance behind this movie. I received nothing out of the time I put in to watch this and it would not matter if I had never seen it."
4,check it out now,i just finished watching this film and can only say that if you view the trailer you should know what to expect. i am a fan of kubrick and tarkovsky and long tracking shots so watching this movie was a joy. the acting is fair but flawed and there is at least one off note (triple vomit session anyone?) but i was sucked back into my school days in a surreal dreamscape of visual bliss and emotional interest by this movie. watch this only if you can appreciate time and space beyond the second mark. this is (bad or good) a piece of art.
4,"In order to understand, you must think","Although I agree that this is more of a thinking trip than an actual..movie-movie, even though I went into it with the mindset of ""okay, this isn't going to be a thriller, but a psychological thing"" I was still rather bored. I know that each individual character is depicted just to get a mindset on the day and what high school is like and the such, but we get nothing from a kid walking down the hall for ten minutes with four words spoken-and that wasn't from the kid.Even the end was unrealistic. I know they weren't trying to explain, but the kid was seeing all this stuff happen (Benny) and didn't do anything. *Blank stare* Yeah. It DOES have meaning; you just have to constantly think to even remotely udnerstand it."
1,Irresponsible and shallow,"I have had a lingering distaste for this film since I saw it some time ago. I felt that Van Sant used the Columbine tragedy as a dramatic device to add weight to what would otherwise be a blend of homoerotic scenes between neophytes and existential meditations on the banality of adolescence (starring particularly attractive adolescents). I found the vignettes of the perpetrators that offered potential explanations as to the motivations and environmental factors that led to this massacre particularly distasteful, and as vapid as the mainstream media discussion following the real life events this story is loosely based on. Were they desensitized due to violent video games? Was the access to guns too easy? Were they misunderstood by their peers? Were they gay? Did they listen to crazy music?Dull as bricks, and offensive.However, if you particularly enjoy looking at adolescent boys, this film may please you on some level."
1,OVERRATED DRIBBLE,Skip this crappy art film that adds nothing to the columbine shootings media outburst and watch a real movie: Paul F. Ryan's Home Room. This movie was terrible and literally unwatchable.
4,ELEPHANT. Not bad.,"This indie movie was a good look at school crimes of violence / murder.It's pretty effective at pulling us into the day to day life of the teens, the build up of events, and all the while there's a sense of something horribly wrong going to happen soon and then it does, all the murders and killings.It's obviously a reference to Columbine murders and while some people are saying that you can't relate to the characters much, I think they come across pretty well. it accomplished a lot on what looks like a modest low budget.I liked the bizarre ambience that gus van sant created, it's something a little different for him. The movie ran kind of slow, so the main thing that i wished could have been better was faster pacing."
2,"Like they say, don't judge a book by its cover","I was very disappointed in this book. I was looking for an analysis of the proposed invasion of England (Operation Sea Lion) from the German perspective. Much to my dismay, while the book is from a German perspective, this is little analysis of the invasion plans. There is some sparse information concerning the logistics involved, but not much else. The author gives you the feeling that the Germans could have succeded with such an endeavor, which is contrary to all the research I've done on the subject. One glaring omission is hardly any reference to the Royal Navy and the role it would have played in defending Great Britain. All in all, a disappointing book."
5,Important book,"The review that follows says it all, but I want to add that this is THE book for African American history in the Seattle area. I found it moving and thought-provoking. Anyone serious about understanding issues of diversity in the Pacific Northwest should begin with this book."
2,Not what I expected,I was disappointed with these push-up bars. They are not as sturdy as others I have used.
2,Disposable Plastic Junk,I had an equally cheap pair of metal push up bars I used for at least 10 years before I threw them away after they started to rust. I used the Valeo's four or five times and then tossed them in the trash. You can spend the same amount (or slightly more) and get something much sturdier.
4,Love these,"I puchased for my boyfirend for Christmas. He loves them. They are study, durable and the price is hard t beat."
2,Push-up Bars,"I don't like it, I thought I was getting a good deal but it's not my cup of tea. I am sure you might like it. I don't ues it. I use a better one."
4,Good exercise bars,"They do their job and are sturdy despite being plastic. They can carry my weight (134 lbs). I guess they will be functional for many years.One issue that I found negative is that somehow they hurt my hands while pushing up. Despite having a foam cover on the handle parts, somehow the plastic bar manages to hurt my hand (usually my right hand). I cannot opt out the possiblity that something is wrong with my hand though (maybe it is week and sensitive. Well, the bars are sturdier than my hands, that is true!)Overall, a good option considering the price."
4,Good value,Nothing special about this product. They do what their supposed to - help you do push ups. I think they are a good deal. I have had them for about a year. They are made of PVC type plastic and foam grips. I thought they looked cheap when I first got them. I suspect they will last a couple more years. Probably the foam grips will be the first thing to wear out.
2,plastic,The shape is good but the plastic pipe is not very sturdy. They give a bit when you push up on them. I expect them to break at some point.
2,Plastic necks cracked easily,"These are light, made of plastic. When I first put them together the necks on the bases all cracked. I can still use them and they haven't caused me any problems yet, but since the necks are all cracked, I'm a constantly thinking they are going to give out on me.I wouldn't advise purchasing them. Look for something a little more sturdy."
2,Not a fan,"I bought these because at the time there wasn't a lot of other cheap options - I'm just doing push-ups after all, right?The plastic was cheap, and already had a kind of stress fracture right outta the box. Hasn't broken yet though.Foam padding is not firm enough, and also low grade.I didn't like how the bars were at an angle - I couldn't find a comfortable position; slanting inwards or slanting outwards? Both felt weird.All in all, they were cheap, and I got what I paid for."
2,A Mediocre Purchase,"As someone who has purchased thousands of dollars worth of merchandise from Amazon (everything from powertools and televisions to books and DVDs), I thought I would give their Jewelry Store a try. I have always been extremely pleased with all of my purchases, but if this is a sample of their jewelry, I'm less than pleased. Cheap packaging, and a junk chain that arrived in knots and took a half hour to untangle. This pendant looks much better on the computer than it looks when you have it in your hand. I think that jewelry is probably best purchased at a brick and mortar where you can examine it first hand."
2,Not the Best Quality,"When I received the Pendant, it was not what I expected. The quality of the chain and the design of the pendant was not the best. The return policy was not user friendly because it stated that I was not allowed to exchange the product. So in the end, I received a lower quality necklace and pendant."
1,The mighty ducks,Well time was not an issue it got here quick. What I didn't like was that 2 movie cases were broken from the middle part n the movies were just bouncing around. I didn't returned them because they weren't scratch but I didn't like the fact that the cases were broken and the movies could of been scratched.
1,Wish I would have read C Leonard's Review,"If I would have read C. Leonard's review, I would have known to pass on thisseries. Monkeys Go Home ruined this for me too. I gave it as a gift and wasamazed to receive a call telling me that Monkeys Go Home was in the MightyDucks 3 movie case. Well, must be an accident, right?!? I sent the first set back and just received the replacement complete with the Monkeys Go Home movie in the third case!!!!Save your money folks....this is not the place to buy a boxed set of MightyDuck movies!!"
5,Mighty Ducks,These movies are the best. They are the perfect family film for all ages. Even my sister who is 17 likes these movies!!! Buy them now.
5,Mighty Ducks,Received package quickly. My son was overjoyed to have all three movies. We had looked for two of the movies at local retailers we were unable to find all three therefore prompting me to look to Amazon which as also came through with flying colors.
3,"Great Movies, Great Price!","I purchased this DVD boxset in November and just now got around to watching them. I have been a long time fan of The Mighty Ducks movies and used to watch them all the time on TV and on VHS. I was happy they were on DVD for me to purchase. They came at a great price too...I believe I paid $20.99. That is awesome considering each movie retails at $10 to $14 each. As for the films themselves, all 3 are presented in their original aspect ratio, 1.85:1 widescreen. I only gave this collection 3 stars as I am not a huge fan of D3: The Mighty Ducks. In my opinion, it's a sequel that never should've been made. It lacks the same magical formula that made the first 2 films so great. The movie feels rushed and it seems to push Joshua Jackson too much into the spotlight. He was never the lead star, Emilio Estevez was always the true star in my eyes. I recommend this boxset if you're a fan of the movies."
5,The Mighty Ducks,A great set of films for the price and delivered to Australia in the time fame Amazon stated. The films have a strong message of not giving up on your dreams or on your mates. My son is 19 now and these are his favourites so it was a great christmas present.
1,Junk,In one week two of the bands ripped while doing a simple side-step exercise. Useless junk and annoying because it didn't qualify for Prime shipping. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
4,As funny as it can get.,"The Beverly Hillbillies is such a unique and funny TV series. The actors and characters are the best you'll see in any TV comedy series. I believe these first shows are the best and full of belly laughs. All the plots are extremely well written and funny. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone looking to escape into a hilarious situation comedy. I continue to watch these shows over and over and enjoy them very much. Possibly, the only other TV sitcom that could compare with the Beverly Hillbillies would be the I Love Lucy shows."
3,Restored?,"I agree with most of the reviews that MPI Home Video done a poor job of so called restoring these episodes. Unfortunately, that seems to be the usual with MPI. The best thing I can say for this set is, at least most of the episodes aren't the run of the mill public domain ones. I will probably buy Vol. 2 only because thery're not available anywhere else. The best thing that could happen to this great series is for Paramount to release it on DVD, in full season box sets. I have 32 episode box set produced by Platinum Disc Corporation, and most of the episodes are better picture and sound quality than the ones released by MIP Home Video."
5,Beverly Hillbillies series is timeless humor,"When I was young I loved ""Beverly Hillbillies"" and still I can watch the reruns over and over and still laugh. Funny how the Clampetts make everything in California seem silly (kind of like today to us non-Californians) and what they think and say sound sensible.Also, the background music from the 60s is truly good and adds to the enjoyment. Today bluegrass music is in style but BH used it back in the 60s plus the good guitar rock riffs.Donna Douglas is truly a beautiful woman, Irene Ryan very talented as Granny, Max Baer always funny as Jethro, Buddy Ebson was the anchor that held the family together. Nancy Kulp perfect as the homely secretary that always had the Clampetts' happiness in mind."
1,Disc freezes up,This show is one of my all time favorites but I was quite surprised when the DVD froze up during the 3rd episode on disk one and would not play. I had to skip an entire scene. If it happens anymore on the rest of the DVD I will return it for a refund. When I spend $30.00 for a brand new DVD I expect it to work.
3,reviewers fail,The show i gave three stars because of the theme song and the unaired pilot. The picture and sound are ok and after all these years the show still makes me laught.To all the reviewer prior to me I give a big zero and thank them a lot for failing to point our that the episodes are not in color as advise on the amazon site but black and white.
3,Pro's and Con's,"+ Definitely one of the best shows of this or any decade. The writing alone warranted this set being released.+ Great cast. Aside from Jethro's mother and the Jethrine bit this cast is always funny and has perfect chemistry, even the Drysdales are perfectly cast.+ The packaging is sturdy although unconventional.+ The closest thing we may get to a Season One.+ At least there ARE extra's.- TONS of video artifacts (black lines) and audio warbles. TERRIBLE. It's almost comical to compare this to shows like the Andy Griffith Show that have been TRULY restored.- I'm not real fond of having all the episodes run into each other as far as run time.- The cover art and packaging really is somewhat drab and unattractive. This truly falls into step with MPI's Honeymooners Lost Episode packaging which is also DULL.- No complete ""Season One"" defies the industry and makes this set almost look like (and feel like) some kind of public domain massacre."
1,When will they learn? WE WANT COMPLETE SEASONS!,"Don't buy this. If we keep giving these idiots money for crappy incomplete ""collections"", they will keep producing them. Hold out for complete seasons!"
3,"Should Have Been So Much Better,For A Great Show Like This","This is my all time favorite sit com....I am glad to have these 26 episodes on DVD.The quality of the shows are not to good.In fact,i have most of these episodes on VHS and the quality of the DVD's are only slightly better than my VHS's.The unaired pilot is very anoying because of the terrible laugh track that is on it.Now for the extras.The cast doing ads for Winston are pretty funny.It was funny to see Granny puffing on Winston's.There is a boring bio of the creator Paul Henning.I was barley able to watch it.There are 2 Music numbers by Granny and Jed.Irene Ryan Was on the Roy Rogers show,singing...I'm a Woman.She did this as Granny.I hope Paramount releases the rest of the episodes.I heard they owned the rights to them.I do not believe these episodes have been restored.My Favorite Show Deserved So Much MORE!!!!"
5,must have,This is a great collection. Every episode is great and it is the type of collection that will never be out dated. I think one of these days my kids will start getting interested in seeing the shows...
1,"Excellent comedy series, but a very bad DVD release!","The picture quality on this is very horrible. There are tons of black vertical lnes, grain, film cracks, film jumps, digital blurs, and poor sound in most episodes. Plus it doesn't even have the X-Mas episode, and it's short 10 episodes of the first season.When you release a TV series on DVD, you want to restore it to absolute full picture quality, so that fans can remember this show in it's best condition. But, The Beverly Hillbillies, will just be remembered as a poorly restored old show. This DVD set doesn't have as near as good picture quality as The Andy Griffith Show, Gilligan's Island, The Munsters, I Love Lucy, and The Dick Van Dyke Show.Overall, a very bad DVD release for The Beverly Hillbillies!"
5,"Kokanee, a down to earth how to book","I am an avid California fisherman and spend most of my time fishing for the elusive Kokanee. Dave Biser has written a book that will greatly increase my Kokanee hook up this 2000 fishing season. I appreciate his detail in discussing the many types of lures, presentations, and miscellaneous tackle. Also, at the end of the book is a listing of addresses and phone #'s where the reader can contact a manufacture listed in the book. Pay attention to the chapter on scents because using ""pro cure"" is an idea I've never heard of until I read this book. It was easy to relate to Daves first experience in the small 14' aluminum boat, with the smoke belching 2-stroke, the big pen reels and lead-core. I've fished that method a hundred times."
4,excellent information,I know some of the people referenced in this book. Great information and a bundle of knowldedge. Some of the product references could be updated but the knowledge and style of catching Kokanee are right on the mark.
4,a wonderful read,"I don't fish. some time ago I gave it up, but fish are interesting animals. Mr. Biser gives an interesting read into the Kokanee. I especially like the fact that he doesn't try to come through putting himself forward as the expert of all experts on Kokanee, but presents what is some careful research from the people for whom Kokanee are a passion. If you fish or if you don't, this is well worth reading."
3,Expensive,"I only needed the mount that was magnetic. Kind of pricey, but it looks great on my HD CD."
2,Cheap... Bad welds...,"It works to raise your handlebars but it looks like it cost about a dollar to make! The welds look like they were done in a high school metal shop. It could be really nice if the welds were smooth and the chrome was heavier. I would be willing to pay more for a better product. However, there isn't a lot of 21.1 options available so the choices are limited."
3,Not as pointy as it sounds,"I like very fine writing pens because I often make small annotations, draft technical diagrams and ink sketches for which I need a very fine, smooth line and ink that doesn't bleed. That being said, these Pilot Razor Point Liquid Ink Porous Point Pens write smooth but the point, to me, is too thick to be considered a razor point. I draws lines that are about the width of a regular ball point. I bought the 12 pack but ended up giving them all away, my co-workers like them just fine so they're functional pens. I did keep one for thicker lines and fills, just don't buy them expecting a very fine point."
4,Great for lefties,"I'm a lefty, and push the pen point into the paper when I write, so roller balls and ball-points jam quickly for me. These pens are more like technical pens with no ball, so they don't jam.This ink is better than the regular Pilot Razor Points and other similar pens because the ink isn't water soluble, so it doesn't bleed when it get a drop of water on it. It also doesn't smear as my left hand passes over what I just wrote.The downsides are that they consistently explode when taken on the plane, and the tip is too delicate to use on my checkbook where pressure must be used to transfer the writing to the second layer of paper."
3,Love the pens...not the supplier,"Suppliers inventory is getting dried out. About half of these work, other half were dried up. But these are my favorite pens when they are not old and expired!"
1,DRIED OUT PENS,"Seven out of the twelve pens in the box were dried out and unusable. Didn't notice until it was too late for me to return. I threw the bad pens away and in good faith, ordered another box. The second box was entirely dry too. DO NOT ORDER THESE PENS, THE SELLER'S INVENTORY IS DRY AND UNUSABLE"
5,Great Pens,"These pens are a perfect marriage of comfort (don't have to press hard) and coverage (ink doesn't come out at different levels, doesn't pool, doesn't streak)Just great pens"
5,Excellent for many surfaces,"This is the only pen I buy anymore. I do a lot of crossword puzzles and I find that it marks precisely and clearly on magazine surfaces. I also like the feel of the pen as it writes. The only issue is that it is common with this pen for the point to bend before the ink runs out, so it is rare that I use all the ink in the pen. And, like some others have said, it can be a hard pen to find."
1,Smaller than indicated,"Product description incorrectly shows a 5/8"" height for the fins indlucing the flat part. It is actually 1/2"" at best and the outside fins even less."
3,SLIDE REMAKE,"OK> But, they really don't do anything to add to the original. Just a variation. However, it'll do."
3,Definitely good resource for the money,"This unit plan for The Great Gatsby is a great supplemental unit for a teacher who is either not familiar with this novel, or just a new teacher without much time to create an entire unit. Some of the lessons are a little bit ""bare bones"" in that they just scratch the surface, and just go into basic information about characters, plot and vocabulary. However, over all, this is a unit that I found very helpful just to get some additional study questions and vocabulary in. There are also quizzes within this unit for the entire novel, broken into chapter increments. If there is one drawback, I found some of the quiz questions to be a little bit trivial or unimportant, so, when using the unit, I have found myself skipping some or editing others. Still, for the price, this is a great time saver for a teacher, and also works as a supplemental tool for the novel.3 1/2 stars"
1,GROSS.....BUT THATS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.,"first of all, amazon.com needs to start watching their products before they sell them. this movie looks SO homeade, i`d be surprised if it had a copyright to sell it. yeah it is SORTA gross, but there are MUCH better movies, this was a complete disgrace to horror fans, and i`m THE biggest horror fan, no arguements cause i know better.....amazon.com if something is widescreen you need to mark it as WIDESCREEN, cause the next time this happens, you will lose my business, AND....i WILL go through the trouble of sending it back for a refund."
5,One of the highest peaks in M5 performances.,"This is with no doubt one of the true crown's jewels in M5 performanceshistory. Vaclav Neumann was a great mahlerian and his Gewandhaus concertson this composer were authentic revelations. Regarding this Neumann's M5,i dont care about silly comments on trumpet`s sound and keys and i wouldbetter pay attention to many other things to enjoy in this swift, sharplyfocused performance. The opening funeral march may lack a bit of atmosphereand density, but the turbulent second movement finds the Gewandhaus playingwith surprising and compelling ferocity. The scherzo is excellently paced,the Adagietto, is perfectly judged and balanced, with a beautiful sound fromthe strings. The finale is wonderful and moving, with awesome and powerful orchestral tutti and an unforgettable coda. With no doubt this recordingis among the very best of this symphony and an absolute recommendation."
3,Some important artistes are missing,"The music is OK.But how on earth do you make a CD and say it comprises the leading women of Electronica and omit the following?:- Justine Suissa (the undisputed Queen of Vocal Trance)- Kirsty Hawkshaw (the runner-up)- Engelina (of DJ Encore and Engelina)- Linda Mertens (Milk Inc)- Nadia Ali (IIO)CORRECTION:Kirsty Hawkshaw is the Queen of Vocal TranceThe omission is glaring given the sub-title of the album.Nonetheless, the following are outstanding with heavenly sultry vocals, and will-make-you-move music:Remember Me by Colleen KellyTransparent (Interstate Remix) by Jan JohnstonSo I'd really give the album 3.5 stars."
4,"Pretty good, if you like the genre","This is a fine CD. It's nice to get a CD featuring ladies mixing it up, since they are often not given the credit they deserve. However, like any ""various artists"" CD, the ""greatest"" are left up to the interpretation of the publishers. There certainly are some great- and overlooked- artists on the CD. It is worth listening to and worth owning. I like over half of the songs and with a mixed artist CD that is rare!For fans of the electronica/dance/techno type of music, I would suggest this CD. It's not trance or anything very hardcore though, the songs do have words in them. If you don't already know the artists on the CD, maybe you'll find a new one you like."
4,Nice addition to our whiteboards,"We needed to have markers that are available all the time for our whiteboards. This product fulfills that need. Markers are the good quality you would expect. The plastic part that holds them is cheap vacuum-formed plastic that barely, barely fills the bill. I had anticipated a better quality holder. So far, it's working though."
2,Mounting Difficulties,"I was not happy with the challenges to mounting the pads on the bridge. Even after much sanding and filing, the clips that are supposed to hold the pads on the bridge kept popping off as I played. Not only that, but the padding on the clips will not stay glued on. This system is not working for me. I'm not sure what I'm going to do next, but in its current state the device is not much use to me."
1,"Yes, It's Inexpensive. . .","but unfortunately that is it's best quality. This is outdated technology, and I so wish I could sell mine. Who would I sell it to? I would have to tell them that it does not work very well.I have never encountered the clip problem, but for a buck and a half this SHOULD be better. Equalizers fail to remove the sound of your fingers plucking the strings. The finger sound IS the prevalent sound. Save your money for something better."
1,Sounds tinny,"I glued the sensors to the bridge with crazy glue gel and elimnated the clip popping off problem. It sounded terrible with the clips but better with the glue. The sound is still pretty high end with weak bass. Even with my amp equalizer set to fully attenuate everything above 250 Hz, it has no bottom. If you like the high end sound, OK. But I wanted more depth."
1,Missing Parts!,"Paid a premium price for shipping and received the item just in time for Thanksgiving, but without the legs! Now I cannot get customer service to respond to messages. Still no legs after 3 weeks..."
3,Boletes of Michigan,A reference guide on boletes that nearly every present day guide seems to refer to on a regular basis. A great book to team up with a microscope.
2,A tutorial needs to tutor!!!,"The book could have been named: ""Debugging Visual C++ for Dummies"". It's contents in certain chapters are not detailed enough to actually teach you how to use to the various debugging tools to full potential. Chapters 4(The Visual C++ Debugger) and 5(Additional Debugging Tools) fit the above description. The author does provide some good suggestions to bolster your debugging process, but to be a true tutorial for the ""intermediate"" programmer, more code examples and actual use of the debugging features is required. Hopefully the next edition will go from an IDG ""...Dummies"" clone to a ""Visual C++ Debugging Bible""."
5,FrontPage 2002 - A Fine Book,"Sam's How to Use FrontPage 2002 is an easy-to-use guidebook to the latest version of FrontPage. I upgraded from FrontPage 98 and found the 2002 version much easier to use. Many of the oddball features of the 98 version have been eliminated. 2002 is a much simpler program to use.This book uses many illustrations in color to show you what to do. These are well laid out and the text is simply and effectively written. I found the index quite adequate although I supplemented it myself with several items that I thought I might require again in the future.The only time I didn't follow the recommendations given by the authors was in dealing with images. I find it often easier to copy the images from scanners and other sites and to move them, also, by copying and pasting rather than by some of the methods suggested.Highly recommended."
5,Don't mind the name,"Inis is great except for the whole ""energy of the sea"" thing. Really, the fragrance is just all around nice, Really wish they would just drop the energy of the sea thing though."
3,Inis energy od the sea,"Fragrance is very,very light.I like a heavier scent,It's okay for daytime.Need to spray more times,more often to keep the scent."
4,Good source for those involved in seeker-oriented ministry,"As the music director of a year old seeker-oriented worship service at my church, I found this book very well-written, and expect it to be very useful.One thing I appreciated very much was the author's clear desire not to over-categorize or stereotype people. While she uses the terms ""seekers"" and ""followers"", she opposes the practice of separating the two groups in worship and instead focuses on ways to create a service that will welcome the seekers without failing to nourish the followers.In addition to being inspirational and providing new ideas, it also laid out a number of good explanations for things I've believed or done all along; it's great to have something in print to point to to help explain why you do things the way you do!I think this book would be very helpful, though not a complete resource, if you're beginning a brand-new seeker ministry."
4,Great book for a family building a house!,We bought this book because we wanted our children to know what to expect while we were building our first home. It was a great step by step guide of the building process with very colorful pictures. I would highly recommend it if you have young children!
4,How a house is built,"Bought this for my grandson who is two. He loves going to the basement and telling me where the duct work is and the water heater is, so I wanted to get him a book to show him about houses. It was a bit too much for him, but I think about 3 or 4 year olds would love this, if they are curious."
5,"Not exactly riveting, yet still a very wonderful book for the younger crowd..","I would recommend this for the 8 and under crowd. An 8 year old may find the style a bit simple but the words and definitions of the workers involved will be enough to suit their fancy. The 5/6 and under crowd will probably need a little help with the longer job titles and whatnot. However, I can really see this book as being an excellent resource for a family to read together with the smaller kiddos if they are building or renovating a house. Also, the budding builders will find this a lot of fun too and I'm sure there will be a segment of children that reread this one over and over again.Pretty cool and highly recommended!JTG"
5,Love this book!,My 3 year old has recently become very interested in home building as we live in a developing community with lots of new construction going on. This book is perfect for him. It goes just far enough beyond what we might think to tell him about house building to really teach him something new and hold his attention. We are always amazed at how much info our little guy takes in and retains so think twice before you write this one off as too advanced for a younger child.
4,Cute book! Loved the rhymes!!,The pictures were good and the rhymes were very funny but easy to read. I loved the ending! Just imagining all the animals trying to stop the hiccups made me laugh!
5,Fun!,Lots of belly laughs from my 6 yr old son!Made up rhyming words roll right off your tongue. Read aloud delightful.
1,The Hiccupotamus,Tired to read this to my 5 year old grandaughter and it did not hold her attention. She loves to be read to.
1,Extremely pleased!,"This book is an absolute must have. Not only is the story great, but the illustrations are amaZENZing!! :) I had to buy a copy for myself and a friend. :)"
2,Disapointing on Kindle Fire,"I thought this book would contain full color images and pop up text (like mentioned on the product page) but it was formatted like any other children's book with the image on top and the text below. The images did not zoom and the color also seemed off when I compared the cover and the same image on the interior color. My daughter had been begging for me to buy it, but she was also not impressed with this edition (after hearing the hardcover at preschool.) She loves ebooks on our various Kindles and I don't know why this one was advertised as a ""Kindle Fire Children's Book"" when it didn't have any of the special features."
3,Dissappointed... 2-3 'made up' words per page is too much.,"Based on all the rave reviews I was hoping for more. The images are cute but the story is lacking, and I think all the made up words distract from the flow of the story. Neither myself or my husband enjoy reading it. I'm also not a big fan of having so many made up words in a story for young children who are still developing their language skills. Examples include: cementipede, elephantipede, shareapy, nightmareapy, quickerish, scaryum. One or two funny words in a story can be cute and humorous, but 2-3 per page is too much. Why three stars? Because my 3 year old son, who likes hippos, enjoys the story and laughs."
3,cute book,Fun read for my 3 and 5 year old. First book I borrowed through prime to read on my kindle fire hd.
3,Good read.,My daughter and I enjoyed reading this book. It's the book of the month for 1st graders at her school. I'd recommend it.
5,Cute,Fantastic and fun.Kids love this book. It's fun to look at and fun to read. Very Dr. Seuss-ish. The fun rolls off the tongue as the kids giggle.
2,Not as good as expected,I was expecting a really cute book to read with my 6 year old. It was disappointing. The artwork was beautiful.
2,Good,My daughter liked reading this book. she thought it was silly. the story line was good and we enjoyed it
1,Even my 6 year old was not impressed,"If I had bought this in physical format instead of Kindle, I would have returned it. My 6 year old son thought it wasn't a very good story and the rhymes were bad. How do you write a book that 6 year olds don't like?"
4,fun for new rhymers!,"Cute book, fun for reader AND listener. My 1st grader loved the rhymes and my two year old loved the pictures."
4,Fun book!,A quick read and my five year old laughed the entire book. I would recommend it for ages three and up.
2,"Okay, but..two year old doesn't like it.",Cute book and lovely drawings. Our two year old really doesn't care for it. He took it out of his bedtime story stack and put it back on the bookshelf!
3,cute,cute little story and picture book but not so great for a basic Kindle. hard to see the words and illustrations
1,Funny and cute,I read this to my 7yr old and we had tons of laughter. She will soon be trying to read it herself.
5,Adorable!,"This book is so much fun to read! I have a 2 year old son and he absolutely loves this book! It is a little bit tricky to read without getting tongue-tied, but after reading it a couple of times I became a pro! I would definitely recommend this book!"
5,hiccupotamus,Both of my sons (4 and 2) have LOVED this book from the time they were infants. It's battered and abused and one of the best books we have!
3,Cute book!,My 3 year old granddaughter loves this book! She makes me read it to her over and over again! &&&
2,"Graphics are good, words are not","The pictures are nice but many of the words are made-up to rhyme with the sentences. I just rather have real words rhyme together, especially if my 3-year old is learning part of his vocabulary from books. We owned this book for three months now and still have not finished it through to the end. He just doesn't like it and wants to move on to another book."
2,Not a good book,The words on the page did not go with the pictures. My 4 year old grandson was confused and didnt like it either.
5,Sweet and fun but hard to hold,"This book is a delight! My 9 month ago got a severe case of the giggles every time we ""hicc'ed"" The trouble was the format. The kindle remained in the horizontal position which I find more difficult to hold with a little one. It also shows two pages at a time so you can't see the hilarious, detailed illustrations as well. I like to look for details with the new reader so he continues to love books and reading."
4,Good Story!,"The audio book part is great, my only small complaint/comment is that the book itself is rather flimsy and will tear easily, otherwise very satisfied!"
2,Buyer beware!!!,Recently made re-recordings of these guys' 1960's era hits. NONE of the songs are the original hit recordings. I was hugely disappointed!!!
4,A VERY GOOD INTRODUCTION TO BEGINNERS!,"Héctor Avalos' ¿Se puede saber si Dios existe? (Can it know if God exists?), published originally by Ediciones de Filosofía Aplicada (Lima: 2000) has three main subjects: 1. Criticisms to God's existence arguments; 2. Is the Bible the God's Word?; and 3. The most secure methods to know the thruth. Author, a former Pentecostal leader, was firstable concerned only to study deeeply the Bible in college to reach a ""true"" interpretation of the God's Word. Bu he came to paradoxical conclussions: a. it is both a contradiction and improbability the existence of a supernatural being all-powerful and omni-benevolent at the same time; b. the allegedlly divine revelation are simply cultural products; and c. the best way to get knowledge on natural and social reality is through science and and not through faith in religious dogmas.M. A. Paz y Mino, Ediciones de Filosofía Aplicada"
5,amazing,I was amazed at how adorable this dragon is when I opened the box. I could not believe how fast it arrived. My nephew will love having this for his dragon collection.
3,House Guest,"Sinbad was BRILLANT !! Loved the movie, will source his other movies. If you want a good laugh ..... WATCH "" HOUSE GUEST ""Houseguest"
5,Funny!,"Do yourself a favor and watch Houseguest. Sinbad plays Kevin Franklin owing a gambling debt he can't pay, he hides from money hungry gangsters with a suburban family under the guise of the father's old college buddy. Sinbad learns that he is supposed to be a famous dentist and manages to pull off a complex dental procedure by accident. While hiding out he manages to save the marriage of his ""friend"", the love life of their daughter, the sports life of the son and set the ""friend"" up for a new career.We are delighted to have it to watch with the whole family. It is really funny! HOUSEGUEST is highly recommended!"
1,It was European formatted!,We LOVE the movie. But the DVD that was sent to us was European formatted and would not pal on our machine!
5,Best Family Movie,This was one of the funniest movies I've seen. Sinbad and Phil Hartman made a great duo. It was funny from beginning to end.
3,No way to close the top,I have another sealline bag that I like better. This one has a completely open top that doesn't stay shut even with the straps pulled tight. It does the job but I don't really like this as much as some of their other bags.
4,Great Guitar accompaniment for fiddlers,"I use this CD to accompany my celtic fiddling. It's a great way to learn reels and jigs SLOWLY at first in order to develop proper technique and familiarize yourself with the songs. My only gripe is that the Bodhran is a bit overbearing ( even though it does help keep the beat alive) and annoying at times and that's why I gave it four stars instead of five. Otherwise, the guitar is fine. It's not a recording that I would recommend for everyone's general listening unless you love celtic music or want to learn songs."
4,Slightly dated,"A good discussion of Perl graphics programming - however, it needs updating to discuss the GD 2 graphics library."
3,So-So,"I have heard great arrangements of Beatles tunes but these are only fair. I was pretty disappointed over all. The musicianship is fine, but the arrangements are lacking--no sparkle."
5,A Touching Story,"Umrigar's writing is extremely vivid and captivating that as a reader you feel as though you are in the story. Sometimes I found myself forgetting that I was actually reading. The story is very touching and realistic, revealing the horrors of class disparity. I high recommend this book!"
4,The Space Between Us,One of the few memorable books on my shelf....I have given it to many friends to read and all have loved it!
2,Disappointed,"Overall I was very disappointed. While I think we were given insights into a particular Indian culture, there was too much repetition and the ending was so unrealistic all I could think was, ""Where did that come from?"""
2,strong begining weak ending,The book started off strong and was interseting in the middle it started to ramble on about the same things and the ending wasjust lazy . I am glad that it did not cost too much money.
2,The Space Between Us,"This book is so depressing, it's just one misery from the start. You actually want something good to happen to these characters but its ends badly too. Even though I suppose its realistic, I would not recommmend it."
1,Don't bother,"It is amazing to me what a publisher will publish in this day and age. This book is worthless. There is no plot. The characters are not developed and nothing they do or say makes any sense. It appears to me, after wasting my time reading this book, that the author's sole purpose is to pass her own depression and melancholy on to others. You know, misery loves company. Well, you will be absolutely miserable if you try to read this book."
4,Interesting book,"I enjoyed reading this book although I was confused at times with the switching of stories of Bhima and Sera. Poignant, believable characters living tragic, intertwined lives. It has motivated me to learn more about India and its culture."
3,Dissatisfied With the Ending,"I did enjoy this book and I do recommend it - but I felt like the ending was too sudden and left me hanging. Worth a read, though."
2,Predicatable,"I thought this story was predictable. The imagery used felt contrived at times, where it took me out of the story. I knew who the father was as soon as I found out that Ashok Mahotra was not the father. I think that was the only surprise in the book. It was disappointing given all the good reviews it got."
2,"Very predictable, shallow plot .","Figured out the crux of the plot on page 16, without even trying. I just read the other 300 pages hoping that I was wrong. I wasn't."
3,It's OK,It's an OK book. The story is good but it is very long winded. It took too long for the story to come to an end. I didn't grow to like any of the main characters either.
5,The Space Between Us,"A beautiful book about friendship and the social classes. The character development of the two main characters was wonderfully done. The reader can empathize with both of their situations. The author did a beautiful job of looking at a ""glass"" from two sides."
2,Unremitting Gloom,The book shows the terrible slum conditions in India where a maid lives in one room with her granddaughter & uses public bathroom where people defecate on the floor. A far cry from the US slums who have flush toilets and running water. The book tells her sad story and her employers story of a wife beater husband. This book is unremitting gloom. Read it if you want to be depressed.
3,"""The Help"" in India","Parts of this book are beautifully written and others, not so much. I actually LIKED the book, but really didn't find it to be a must-read. Some conclusions were oh-so-obvious, such as family ties will prevail (although I was rooting for a righteous ouster of the son-in-law). Perhaps if I had read this book when it was first published, I would have rated it a bit higher, but after reading The Help, which brought back memories of happenings in my own childhood, this one just didn't resonate."
3,Great portrayal of the cast system working in India but...,The story gave a very accurate picture of how the cast system in India works and how people born into a low position really have no out ... I thought the stories of both woman were strong and believable however then the book just ends with both woman acting in ways very different from how they were portrayed throughout the story ... its like the author just ran out of steam and ended the story.
4,The Space Between Us: A Novel (used paperback),The book arrived on time and in excellent condition exactly as advertised by Amazon.com. The book was required reading for a book club. Enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it as a good read.
5,Two Different Worlds,"Not knowing much about the complex society that is India I thank Thirty Umrigar for helping me understand this country better. Using the human relationship of two very different women ,Sera and Bhima...... the world of Bombay comes to life. The story is heart wrenching and totally absorbing. This novel is a book club lovers dream book.It has so many layers and provides a wonderful source of a many layered discussion..........class and cultural differences,friendship,physical abuse,abortion, poverty, family loyalties etc, etc, etc..........A WONDERFUL READ!!!!!!!!"
5,"Awesome, a must read book!!","If you are here checking out the reviews for The Space Between Us, then you need to know that this novel is a must read. A rich, vibrant story with strong, believable characters. I hate nothing more than buying an expensive book and being let down. That is not the case here. Set in India, the lives of a middle-class woman and her maid will totally captivate you. I hated putting it down, finished it quickly, read it again, and crave more. I am now reading Thrity's first novel and am enjoying it as much as this one. A very talented author capable of a smooth storyline. Many great characters, mannerisms, and a good introduction to a different way of life. Highly recommended!!"
3,Not great,"The story was quite predicable -- The author used lots of foreign words with no glossary or explanation. After a while, I didn't care. A B- book at best."
1,Disappointing,"While it is a well written book, the story is worthless. The characters are pathetic, hateful, and vicious each in their own way. As I read on, I learned to hate each and every one of them and grown unsympathetic to their misery. The women are portrayed as weak and wretched and the men even worse...If this is our glimpse into the Indian culture, their portrayal isn't that flattering.Don't waste your time"
2,"Men are pigs, life's not fair","Did I read the same book as many of the other reviewers read? I found the writing bland, dialog horribly boring, disjointed and the plot was missing. The characters were not developed. It was a fast read because I skimmed. The book was not horrid but I would not recommend."
4,The Space Between Us Large Print,The book arrived in good fashion. It is great to get a Large print edition for a reasonable price.
2,why education is important,"The book, Space between us, is disjointed, character has no hidden spark, beaten by surroundings and life circumstanses. Eastern indian maids are slaves. the women are beaten for almost any reason and without education, living in the slums, one becomes a drone. i just do not get why books portray these women as mean, ruthless to the wives of the sons and cold hearted to the daughters. Read The Help for a better written portrayal of maids/cooks and their employers. the author spent a lot of time talking of the slums-very little words about the fancy house the maid worked in. would not recommend."
1,Very sad,"This book captured me immediatley. The stories of each ladies life is very interesting, but the more I read, the more depressing and predictable it became."
3,"okay, but not great","This book had a good story, and the writing did at times (as Publisher's Weekly said) achieve clarity. But overall I thought the writing was bland and the characters two-dimensional. The dialogue was at times downright unbearable, particularly when deally with the Serabai story. And the characters weren't consistent. Some may claim that Umrigar was showing that things aren't always what they seem, but I argue that the characters weren't developed enough for us to understand and accept the reasons for them to act out of character.For those of you who enjoyed this book, may I recommend a much richer, more beautiful book that takes place in India called The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy. Here is a book that gets below the surface of the characters and plot and setting and truly speaks to the heart."
3,Stopped caring.,"Not the best or worst book I ever read. Just in the middle. I like realistic fiction and when it's based somewhere interesting, I like it more. Read Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns. Much better in my opinion. This book is average."
4,Well written and informative,"I read this book for our book club and thought it was definitely good but not positive I would have picked it out myself. Glad someone did because it tells me of life in another country, what there struggles are, poverty and survival. I need to be understanding of all of that. I would recommed to friends now. For a critique - a little puzzled on why all the talk of the man who sells the ballons??"
4,book club pick,"This is ""The Help"" in India. VERY good and insightful. The plots are completely different. I got confused with the names a few times, but it is worth reading."
4,A wonderful tale about class structure in India!,Great story! Engrossing characters! You are always rooting for these two women! I did not want the book to end!
3,A Heavy Read.,"I found this book to be a heavy read. It is, as the author says, a book about what brings us together and what divides us as human beings. The storytelling is very well done as is the character development. Sera and Bhima form an intimate relationship without every overcoming the separation of social class that prevents a friendship between them. I have to admit that I didn't really like the ending."
2,Hated this book!,"Colorful prose that went on and on, as well as two unlike able main characters, made this a miserable read. The plot twist was surprising, but led to an obvious conclusion. I had to force myself to finish the book.My advice - skip it!"
2,Not much joy in this book.,The tone of this book is very angry. The characters are always mad about something and it gets old after a while.
4,"Slow to start, but overall a good read.","This was a touching read that really demonstrates the differences between classes in India in a way that most people can understand and relate to. I found the characters were realistic and the storyline interesting, despite a slow start. I found myself cheering for Bhima and unable to put the novel down as I moved through the middle to the end of the novel.Umrigar does a nice job describing the difference between classes and women and weaves a tale that shows that despite differences in backgrounds, income levels and status in society, women experience hardships (many of them timeless--run-ins with mother-in-laws, abusive husbands) and deal with them in different ways.This isn't a light and breezy read, but it is engrossing and will leave the reader satisfied and wondering what happens next."
3,Inner strength verses money & power,"This book will stay with you after you have finished - it will make you analize your own life because of Bhima's desperate plight against trying to survive day by day. Although I found the book quite depressing, I also wanted to know more about how Bhima found the inner strength to carry on - and this is how I still feel now that I've finished."
5,Excellent,"Was very well written, heart wrenching. How cruel life can be for some. Was very believeable, and probably all true."
5,space between us,"This book has changed my life in many ways and I'm especially grateful to have Amazon Books to choose from.Thankyou,Care Seltmann"
2,Weak Compared to Expo,"These markers produce a very faint line, almost like they are already dried out. I'm sending mine back. Don't waste your money on these and get the Expo brand."
5,Purchased from Bargain Basement 3rd party,"Don't let the inaccurate image fool you. I was worried that since the image doesn't match up to the title, that I wouldn't receive the item I ordered: White, China markers. Well, I did, they work great (I use them for darts at a local pub), and being it is very hard to find white china markers, let alone at a good price, I'm quite happy with the purchase.As a note, the 3rd party that supplied mine for this order was Bargain Basement, though based on the way Amazon stores inventory, I expect you will always get exactly the same item, regardless of who the 3rd party is."
3,hard to peel phano china marker,"These work well to mark hard to mark glossy surfaces, but the peel is difficult to peel well and I am often left with having to peel several layers at once to reveal any new material."
4,"Good price, ok quality, not as dark as similar products","I found these china markers to be effective enough, but the color was a little disappointing. Unless you press down hard, they don't write as darkly as similar products by different companies. Good price though, as long as you're looking for a super dark grayish rather than a black china marker."
4,Works Well,"Bought these to write on glass, metal, and plastic containers. No problem writing to these surfaces, plenty of marking on the surfaces, so it's easy to read, and wipes off with a little bit of elbow grease applied (that is, it doesn't simply brush off and lose the markings accidentally, you have to want to get it off). It can discolor plastic a little bit the longer it is left on."
3,winnie,"I definitely like this marker.The only problem is that when I tried to peel off the paper, the quality is really bad."
1,Its too Permanent! You cannot wipe it off most plastic surfaces,"Well before I purchased a dated bottle system, I bought these to write on baby bottles and bottle tops for my baby with dates and food contents. Well it would not come off the top or the bottle, I tried bleach, comet and oxiclean and you can still see 3/15/11 on there. I have also tried it on Tupperware containers and it still leaves a black smudge or the words I wrote. So they are nice... glide well, show up well and all that.. just know it's not leaving well!"
5,Great Storage,"I use these boxes to keep my computer area neat and organized. I purchased one for my husband and one for me. They are a great way to keep the computer desk clear, especially when guests are coming since our computer area is in full view of our entry door. The boxes are exactly as pictured, and the drop down side makes it easy to slide folders in and even sort through them while in the box. They are easily stackable and the green is a very neutral shade."
5,Boxer dog,The item was in new condition and arrived very quickly despite it being holiday time. I will order from these people again!
2,highlights only here,"Don't be mistaken here. This is not the complete opera, as one would normally expect, especially since nothing printed on this release indicates otherwise. It is sixty minutes of excerpts therefrom. I don't collect highlights so was quite disappointed."
3,a bit of a disappointment,"The writing wasn't bad and the story was more original than most, but what killed this book was the characters. The woman was the worst. She treated the guy quite badly for most of the book, and overall, I found her self-centered and unlikeable. The guy wasn't quite so bad, but the author didn't really describe him in a way that let the reader get very attached to him. This was by no means among the worst books I've read, but it is definitely not one to run out and buy as soon as possible."
5,Interested in aspiring to the next level of television reporting?,"Don't read this book just once. Read it twice, and then maybe even once more. Make sure the principles and teachings of Mr. Freedman are so ingrained in your mind, you apply them in the field, and during the writing process, with ease, despite any pressures or deadlines. Why? Because it takes more than good looks to succeed at television news reporting."
3,Dedication,"The Russian word ""Posvyachenie"" means ""Dedication"". This collection of ""shanson"" (informal pop/folk) songs - mostly duets - includes some of the last works completed by the popular Mikhail Vladimirovich Krug before his murder on July 1, 2002, at the age of 40. Mikhail's strong vocalizations are always front and center... accompanied by guitar, accordian, drums, and occasionally a brass section."
1,"Super, super small",These are SO small that they look like they should be for a little girl. I'm a petite size 8-10 but there's no way they would fit. Don't waste your money like I did. I didn't even bother to try them on when I pulled them from the box....you can tell by looking that they won't fit because they are SO small!
3,Careful Moving While Clamped,"The clamp holds my NT1a tightly, but unfortunately I rotated the microphone while clamped ever so slightly, and it already ripped off a corner of the rubber protecting the metal piece on the mount from scratching against the microphone casing. Not very impressed with the quality. But it is doing its job, holding the mic."
4,Good crime sceen investigation.,Characters are good but they could do a little more to make the characters moreinteresting. Stories are well written.
2,Innocent?,"This should have been called An ""Innocent"" Slogging Around Ireland. The author explains early on his notion of innocent, but I would hardly call a middle-aged man who picks up a young chambermaid an innocent. (Also, is this guy middle-aged, as the cover photo would indicate, or he is considerably older? He looks about 70 in the flap photo.) Moralizing aside, the author seems only vaguely interested in his plan to follow H.V. Morton's route, and he tends to skip from one subject to another in the space of a single paragraph. Though he makes attempts to explain the look of a thing, person or place, his prose isn't very visual. I also agree with another reviewer that there should have been photographs included. I am very glad I didn't buy the volume on Scotland, which I had been tempted to do. Read Tony Hawks or Pete McCarthy instead."
2,For Die-Hard Fans,"First off, Will Eisner had nothing to do with most of the stories in this volume. Most of the stories in this volume are fairly dull and predictable, the wonderful wit and humor of The Spirit being replaced by pretty lame one-liners. Not exactly bad, but not memorable.This volume is notable for the return of Will Eisner in its final two stories. Fresh out of the service following World War II, he offers up a couple of humorous stories that point the book back to its roots with style and wit."
3,Why cain't ah learn to keep mah big mouth shut?,"This volume of The Spirit Archives reprints the comics from the second half of 1945. Spirit creator Will Eisner was in the Army during World War II, so the comics from that time period were done by other people. Most of the comics in this volume were drawn by Lou Fine. He was a good artist, but he was no Will Eisner. The strips he drew here are okay, but they some of the weakest Spirit comics ever. However, Eisner did get out of the service in time to do the last two Spirit comics of 1945, which saves this book somewhat."
3,Long for the amount of info,It could have been half as long. FFW was handy. The just of the teachings are great.
5,Words can't tell,"This is the best single song I have heard ever! All they need for this album is one track. From the introductory robotic noise to the piano (keyboard) to the synths and back again, this album has it all.Since those reading this now have probably realized this album is not made anymore, you will probably have to invest in Teachings in Silence. All that does is add to the perfection of this song and give you more Ulver for your buck! The whole Teachings album so masterfully orchestrated you just may find your self disappointed in what you classifed as great music before.Recommended for people of both extremely open and closed minded nature and all those in between. If you are open minded, you will find this refreshing and hopefully a plesant listening experience. If you are closed minded to metal, DJ music or anything else, this would make a great gift to an open minded person!"
1,Slimy,I don't know if I am putting this stuff on wrong or not. Directions say to put it on liberly . The stuff never dries it stays slimy. No problems with the seller just the product.Do not buy you won't be happy.
5,works great keeps hands and fingernails easy to clean,no gloves needed can work faster with this product on hand make sure to rub in fingernail bed and then after automotive work wash hands and they come clean sith just soap and water sometimes just water. ussually use automotive cleaner and scrub and scrub hand have oil in nail bed then wait couple of days for oil and grime to wear of but not this product can get hands clean same day
1,Not for me,"This item works exactly as described with respect to protecting skin from grease, grime and non water based paints and solvents. However after using this product my skin dries up terribly for at least 24 hours after being fully washed off. And if used again the next day, as I would do in a manufacturing setting, my skin dries up so badly that painful cracking of my finger tips begins. I do not recommend this product to anyone, especially if you have sensitive skin."
4,"Great product, could have filled the tube more","I like this sort of lotion. It works well. The problem when I received it, it seemed as though it was either used or some had leaked out. After closer review I realized it was only 5oz whereas another product with the same size container was 8 oz. When one considers the expense of the container, one would think they would at least fill it up. The seller was fast- no problems there."
3,my first spring plastic gun,"the shipping is fast , i got it in less than 3 days.When i pick up the package, the light weight did surprise me :) is that the right package ?I opened it . see some big chinese word....only a paper of instruction ...i install all the things . try to shoot it ...um...woo..it can shoot @@@....the BB hardly break in a shipping paper boxwith this price , this gun is great for collectables..quite cool shapebut undoubtfully, no for shooting practise, not for game :)I am not a ""return"" person and i will keep itpay the price and get what you have !"
4,M16a1 Airsoft Rifle,"likes: its transportable you can take the stock off :its easy to reload and easy to charge the rounds in the chamber :its light :excellent rangedislikes: when discharging the weapon the round veers off target, accuracy could be better: slippery grip :small round capacityout of 10 I would give it a 8.5 for combat.out of 10 I would give it a 9.6 for close quarters.out of 10 I would give it 4.8 for sport hunting."
5,The most devastating reference to creationism,"Over the past 20 years, I have reviewed hundreds of creationist documents and scientific documents that criticize creationism. Although 10 years old, I have found this reference to be the best. Strahler demolishes most creationist arguments. It is so good, that the Creation Research Society Quarterly did not mention the existence of the document until 1990, or three years after it was published!"
4,just what you need,This thing is lite and that was important to me too help keep the weight in my rack down.I like the latch too.Prices on all of this type of gear is high I think but this was affordable and does the job I need it to do well.It is plastic though so you might have to pay for the metal ones if you are real hard on your gear or are putting heavy items in it.I use mine for mics and cables.
2,For a younger audience,"I agree, it's for a younger crowd. The cases are short little chapters but it's not a choose your own adventure kind of journey. You read the next line and find out the answer and you're kind of lead by the hand. Plus most of the answers seem to be "" (e) All of the Above "" Sorry to say, it's not work buying new."
2,ideal for a seventh grade school student,"Maybe I am a tough critic but I am a medical buff and not easily pleased with boring cases. I have degrees in chemistry and biology and was very disappointed in the grade school level difficulty of solving the cases. I bought the book with the anticipation of testing my medical knowledge but once I opened the first case knew the book was better suited for a teenager. If you have no medical experience, perhaps this would be a less than nap worthy read but if you know anything about science in general...skip it."
1,Frequent jamming,"Boy, have staplers gotten bad in the past few years. I bought a few staplers for my wife's dental practice, and all of them frequently jam. The lost time in trying to get these unjammed would have paid for dozens of staplers. Does anyone make a stapler in the USA anymore. This Chinese stuff wastes a lot of time!"
1,not so good,this was very small and disappointing!materialwise- certainly not silver as i have alergoes that flared up & that woul not happen with pure silver!
2,A Tutorial,"This book is a basic tutorial, and not the best. Consider buying the New Riders book, much more in depth, and worth every penny."
3,"Too much politics, not enough romance","When reading this book, you should realize that Tolstoy is setting his heroine's life against the political backdrop of Russia. Therefore, there are long boring sections on Russian politics which the modern reader doesn't care anything about. The political sections really bogged down the story for me."
5,Great Book!,I thought this book was very informative and up to date. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to fully understand the process of losing weight and/or getting in shape! I found a lot of very surprising information that really helped me to understand what fat cells really are and how your body really works. I have had much more success in controlling my weight and getting in shape since reading this book. It's a good read even if you don't want to lose weight...very informative!
5,TAKE THAT !,"Probably very much like the stapler your father used to have this Swingline product is a workhorse. It's utilitarian, useful, and strong.We've little necessity for stapling large number of papers but we can say that it staples 25 sheets effortlessly.There seem to be a number of staplers boasting rulers, ergomonic handles, etc. But, all we want is a stapler that works, and this is it."
1,Mostly metal but crucial parts are plastic,I purchased this stapler in hopes that it was all metal. It is indeed mostly all metal EXCEPT for two crucial parts both of which eventually broke. One broken plastic part I was able to rig with a metal screw but later the second plastic part broke rendering the stapler totally nonfunctional. This second part is what holds the top half to the bottom half. Why in the world is this plastic?!
2,"Plastic, not metal... Boo!","Plastic, not metal... Boo! These classic staplers, if still available in metal, should be indicated as such. They were a disappointment."
4,Breathtaking dance remixes!,"These dance remixes of ""You Raise Me Up"" are nothing short of fantastic! My favourite is the Reactor Remix, which stays true to the original and it sent chills down my spine when I discovered that the beauty of this song had been kept intact in this remix while still freshening it up with dance beats and swirling synths. The Chameleon Remix takes the song in a darker direction, adding a mystic vibe to it and the drum rolls here are to die for. These remixes are awesome, but I wish they would've included full club mixes too but this is definetly not bad! Thumbs up! :)"
4,Great card when it finally comes,this one little card took almost 3 weeks to get to my house but other than that its great holds hella memory
3,Electronica Mish-Mash,"Great stuff individually but as an album it jerks you around... Some tracks, like Isolee's Porno Nights, are reminiscent of Kraftwork, some tracks, like Stereotype's Skyway, are good Ambient and other tracks, like Better Daze's Oasis are great jazzy gems... but not really worth the price of the album. If they'd just stick to one genre at a time it might be easier to listen to. Good sampler to find new groups... Mediocre album."
2,Hand-clean the threads before using,"I'm not sure if this item was really from Valterra - their products tend to be well made, while this one was not. It's made up from two halves glued together, and they didn't line up perfectly. This left notches in the threads that I had to remove with an xacto knife; there were also some globs of plastic in the threads that I had to cut out. I ordered mine from mobile-mart through Amazon; I'm not sure if it would be the same with other suppliers."
2,Warranty Difference,The service was fast and the product was exactly what I ordered. I ordered these washing machine hoses based prior experience with this exact model hose and the advertised 10 year warranty. This warranty is clearly printed on the hose packaging but the tag on the actual hose says 5 year warranty. It's not Grady's fault but it sure seems like false advertising by Fluidmaster. What's up with this?
3,Worked for a While,"I was ""issued"" this stapler to use in my high school classroom. After less than one academic year, the spring broke inside. I replaced the spring with a rubber band, and got another few months of use out of it. But after the rubberband broke, I decided to purchase one for myself. I'm trying to find one not made in China."
2,Be gentle or it will break,"I special ordered the Swingline 545 stapler at my local office supply store on Sept. 1, 2008. It broke about a year later. Maybe I hit it too hard, but I was only stapling paper. The internal part of the stapler, which is metal, is attached to the top of the stapler, which is plastic, by a piece of plastic. The plastic broke and is impossible to fix. For a few months now, I've been manually lifting the mechanism every time I staple. However, I finally decided to buy a higher quality stapler to replace it. I liked the 545 because it was small, light, modern-looking and cheap, but what good is a stapler that breaks?"
3,just your basic stapler,nothing super special but just your average stapler . can't expect more or less from a cheap stapler but if u want better go get the high quality ones
5,"As effective and durable as ""Rio Red""--and it even zaps germs.","Despite the almost ""cultish"" devotion to Swingline's ""Limited Edition Rio Red"" stapler (costing 4 times the price of the pictured Swingline Standard model), I received ample proof that, even with the extra weight and size, Rio Red is far from indestructible. All it took was an accidentental drop of about 5 feet onto a hard-wood floor to put it permanently out-of-commission (or at least beyond the ""fix-it"" capabilities of most casual users). The Swingline Standard model is a no-brainer--especially given the increased price disparity between the two models. Still, if the color red is your thing, choose to be different (but remember to wash your hands after each use)."
5,Works Great,I do a lot of stapling at my job and my other stapler just wore out. This one seems to fit the bill and works great. Fits in my hand perfectly. Good quality and construction of product. I expect years of usefulness
3,It Works but . . .,"For its price, the stapler is great. If you want to simply staple a couple or a small group of papers together, this stapler does its job; however, if you are someone who has to staple papers, bulletin board paper, etc., to bulletin boards on the wall, you might want to consider a different stapler. This ""hammering"" part of the stapler will not fold back all the way, so you can never staple directly to the bulletin board. You always have to staple at an angle. Once again, this is not a bad product for the price, but you get what you pay for."
3,Good but look cheap,"This stapler generally work well. Since it contains recycled material, the stapler look cheap and when I hold it, I feel like I could easily break it if I press it too hard. Overall, it's an okay stapler."
1,Stapler FAIL,"Would never staple more than a few pages (4 at the most). Even then, most of the staples were mangled. After a dozen uses, the little plastic part that held the staple pusher cracked and fell out. Buy the all-metal Stanley Bostitch B515, instead."
1,Cheapened Product,"I have an old top of the line Swingline stapler that does an excellent job of stapling as many as 20 sheets of paper together. When my wife needed a new stapler, I went to Amazon and ordered the top of the line Swingline stapler similar to the one I had. It did such a lousy job of stapling that I had to return it for a replacement. The replacement is a little better, but still not as good as my old stapler. In my old stapler, the plate that forms the staple is completely recessed into the base where it is held solidly in place. On the new stapler, the plate is only party recessed into the base. Swingline obviously saved a few cents by cheapening its product without regard for its performance. A price that we customers have to pay more and more every day as quality is sacrificed on the altar of the almighty dollar."
2,There are Better Staplers Available.,"I have a Swingline Standard Stapler and have had it in my office for a number of years. It was cheap and looked nice but hasn't worked nearly as well as the older, cruder model it replaced. Although looking rather attractive it is nowhere nearly as sturdy as my previous stapler. It jams off and on and sometimes gets the staple stuck to where it requires a pliers to remove it. It works fairly well with up to six pages, but beyond that it struggles. I would not regard it as a quality office instrument. There are better staplers available, although they might cost more.Gary Peterson"
1,Bad Design,"Have used Swingline staplers for 45 years; this is the first one that broke the first time I used it.It cost too little to bother returning it, so I gave it to Goodwill..."
2,matty against the Swingline 545,"matty against the Swingline Model 545 StaplerUnfortunately this stapler doesn't abide by proper European Stapling Protocol (ESP) standards. However, it is functionally robust when used according to American Stapling Protocol (ASP) standards. It is my feeling that ESP will soon become more prevalent among American companies in the near future, I like to call it the ""New Metric."" If Swingline doesn't step up to the plate and produce a stapler that follows both ESP and ASP standards, I will be looking for a new tool."
5,Swingline Stapler,"Nice, lightweight stapler at a decent price. I can staple pieces of paper together with it, so I think it does what it's supposed to."
1,I didn't know evil came in the form of staplers,"I just wanted somewhere to record my absolute disgust with this stapler. You would think it would not be that difficult to neatly bend a small strip of steel to bind a couple pages together but evidently that is the case. It isn't that this stapler jams and won't staple, it's that it staples and does a horrible job which is almost unarguably worse. The bind is loose and easily broken and the stapler seems to frequently forget that it is a stapler, not a hole punch. I will soon be purchasing a replacement to what is supposedly a ""working"" device and after I have a replacement, I have a hunch this stapler will find it's way into the garbage, in pieces. It would be an act of evil to consciously give this stapler to another human being."
1,I hate this stapler,"I have this stapler in green. Not sure why it doesn't work, but it just doesn't.It staples about every third attempt. Other than that, it spits out staples at random, ties staples in ""knots,"" jams up, and otherwise makes me crazy.I had a Bostitch stapler that worked perfectly, but it disappeared. I think someone ""borrowed"" it because it worked so well. Go Bostitch!Too late to return this yucky thing. I'm going to have to replace it as it just refuses to staple anything."
1,not white as pictured,"This stapler is not at all like the bright white color pictured. It's more of an off-white, grayish color, like it's been sitting yellowing in the sun for 15 years. Plus, it feels super cheap. Not what I expected from Swingline."
1,Never worked.,"Shipped fast, but was broken when I got it. Didn't work at all, very cheaply made.Wish it would have worked just for a couple weeks, and I would have been fine with it, but nope."
5,"Good item, works properly so far!",I'm a student therefore I use this item quite often but not on a daily basis. Right now it's working fine and I've been able to staple more than 20 sheets. I recommend it specially because it wasn't expensive at all and seems to be quite robust.
2,OK!!,They are in fact 8lbs but very small and need to be inflated. I was expecting more of a women's basketball size and it was more like a mini basketball.
5,medicine ball,Works very well - comfortable and does its job. It is a good color which is easy to keep track of.
3,Heavier than it sounds!,"Bought this cuz I was looking for a ""light"" weight to use to stretch my computer arms. :O I have RSI. Love the texture of the ball itself. Because of the repetitive strain injury I have trouble holding regular weights and this was a suggestion I saw on a Rheumatoid arthritis video.4 pounds actually seems to heavy to start out with - both to my injured hands and the tight muscles in my neck and shoulders.On the plus side, the texture of the ball lends itself to using for slight pushing and stretching of my fingers.Plan to try a 2 pounder..."
3,Good for home use,"This is okay, but a far cry from the medicine balls I use at the gym. Kind of slippery surface. The sand filling is a bit strange. You have to be careful not to inhale any when you are inflating the rest of the ball!Also this is a pretty tiny one. I can easily hold it with one hand.Not very firm when you lean your weight on it. Wouldn't be great for pushups.But it is a great, cheap alternative to the real ones."
5,Valeo WFB4 4-Pound Weighted Fitness Ball (4lb),This weighted ball works well for me. And it is great to help work on tightening your abs.
5,weighted fitness ball,This came delivered on time and was even better than I expected. It has some give in it's shape making it easier to grasp while exercising.
5,Excellent for rolling against smooth wall,I have been performing physical therapy exercises at home to regain strength in some muscles following a cervical spine with fusion surgery. One of the exercises I am to perform is rolling a ball clockwise and counter-clockwise against a wall with my arm extended. The ball is comfortable and does not slip on the wall. I have bought 4 different weights and have no regrets. The price was great as well. I would not hesitate in recommending this product.
4,Kids love it!,We never used it for exercising like it was intended. It does seem to be of quality and our 4 and 2 years olds love carrying it around. It has survived a lot of rough outdoor play and now damage.
5,Heavy Little Ball,"I originally bought the weight ball for my wife, but find myself using this palm sized ball in ab crunches and triceps. This little ball is the perfect size even for a large man to add some extra weight while maintaining a closed hand grip posture."
1,looks bigger than it is,Do not buy this if you are expecting a full sized medicine ball. This one fits in the palm of your hand
1,Why sand filled?,"The ball that I ordered was also filled with sand-- although it sounds like other people had air or gel filled balls. A sand filled ball doesn't fit my needs at all, and I am very disappointed in the description of this product. I plan to not buy Valeo products again."
2,Not what it appears to be,"This is a weighed fitness ball, but very deceptive by what you see. The ball is small - about the size of a cantalope - and full of sand for the weight. It is slippery rubber on the outside so you can't use it for certain exercises because it can slip out of your hand. We were very unhappy with the product."
2,"Characters, setting distant and nondescript","This booked evoked a huge 'eyeroll' for me...cliche, predictable, void of essential character that really lets the reader connect with a piece. I picked up this novel because of its setting initially - as a native of the small-town climate of the northern midwest, it's easy to sense that Benson could have done a better job of establishing not only the social but physical climate of this area. The characters were also void of any real opportunity for the reader to connect with who they are and what makes them unique -- a nebulous, fairly crafted yet very predictable tale existed without the grounding of a well-described setting and characters -- guess that keeps the expectations broad for when the film version comes out."
4,"Good value, but not made in America","These are great socks, very thick, and the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are not made in USA. Otherwise, a very good value for a thick sock."
3,Good socks,"I have been wearing these socks from Gold Toe for several years. Not only do I wear them during the day with loafers, but I also wear them at night with slippers. They do tend to fall a bit, but I do not consider this to be an issue. They are comfortable and durable, too. I recommend these socks."
3,Sizes run *very* small,"The socks are nice enough, and seem to be holding up well. But be advised the sizes run almost ridiculously small. I have a men's size 10.5 foot and ordered these socks in the appropriate size.The ""foot"" part of the sock looks like it's for a 12 year old kid and the elastic piping that is meant to hold the sock around your calf starts almost at my heel. And they were so absurdly tight the first month that I could barely stand to have them on all day, they would leave deep imprints in my calves. And yes, I checked the bag and it was marked Mens 9 to 12.Perhaps they sent me kids socks in a men's bag. <shrug> They certainly seem undersized and tight."
1,Complete Rip Off,"I purchased these because I was seeking high calibre black athletic socks. The cost plus freight came to $26.70 for 6 socks .... that's roughly $4.50 per pair - OUCH! Twenty bucks was bad enough but to add more than 30% more to the overall cost??? Ok, so I did not think it through completely & wanted socks for my Yeti sized feet - shoot me.To add to my disappointment while waiting for these (should be) solid gold socks to be shipped, I was in Costco & found socks of equal quality & size (size 14 shoe) for just $9.95. Hmmm, lets do a little math - 16 pairs for the same overall price as 6 from this seller .... time to hit the control/alt/return keys on my laptop."
5,Repeat Purchase,"These are my ""go to"" socks for everyday work and casual wear. Just purchased another 6 sets following my original purchase about 4 years ago. (Eventually the heels wear out.) Very comfortable, with athletic sock thickness - yet breathable for warmer weather. Hopefully, these are the same quality of the set from 4 years ago. Seems so - but I will update this review if necessary."
5,Hubby's FAVORITE,"These really are great socks! My husband works hard, and these hold up beautifully. LONG before they wear out, they fade a bit, but still have good stretch, say put and are well worth the money. Try'm...you'll come back for more! The one who does the laundry ;~))"
4,Good socks by any criterion,"These would be perfect if they lasted forever.These are pretty comfortable, they wash well, they're neither too ""dressy"" nor too ""athletic,"" and they have just the right amount of friction for playing Dance Dance Revolution on a soft pad. But I wouldn't expect a pair to last more than a couple of months of regular use."
4,"For the most part, I'm pleased","The product arrived in a timely fashion. I am pleased with the quality of the product. My only negative comment, is that I wish the heel of the sock was better protected. But they did last for a good amount of time."
3,OK for basketball however not enough cushioning on the bottom,Due to a relative lack of cushioning on the bottom the sock is only OK for hoops. The large size is better than the head extra cushioning sock I normally use. Head sock has significantly more cushioning but is too small for my size 13 feet.
3,The search continues.........,Gold Toe used to make a heavily cushioned sock with a good knit-in arch support; for whatever reason they discontinued it. I've since tried three of their other socks because of the Gold Toe name. They may be a quality sock but if you're looking for cushioning you won't find it here.
2,Whatever,"I didnt like them, returned them. If your looking for an over the calf sock, this isnt it. And as a crew sock, I found them falling down constantly. Maybe they will work for you but I didnt like them."
3,Not good for moderate walkers,"These are nice thick socks, but they aren't very sturdy, in my experience. I'm a moderate walker (about an hour a day on the weekdays) and wore pairs of these socks 2-3 times a week for the past four months. I'd end up with bits of sock between my toes almost every day, coming home, and it would track all over the carpet. The past few weeks they've started to reach the end of their practical lifespan, with holes wearing in the heels. I've had Gold Toe's Sport Liners for twice as long--and used as often--and they're still going strong. If you walk a lot, I wouldn't recommend these, personally; otherwise, they make a decent sock for the autumn and winter months."
4,good sock,"Overall a good quality sock. Pretty much the same as the gold toe white athletic sock, with the ""shedding"" issues many people have complained about being greatly exaggerated. Its a black athletic sock, of course you're going to notice some fuzz, and if you turn it inside out to wash it will taper off after 2 washings. Tends to fade rather somewhat quickly, which really is the only negative"
2,"Gold Toe not so ""Gold"" anymore...","Been wearing Gold Toe socks for over ten years. A brand I once trusted is no more, and gone the way of the cheap manufacturing. These are comfortable, and they stay up, but like others have said, one or two washings, and they'll pit and look old and shabby. I'll still wear them, but only as long as they're covered in the gym. As a reference, I compared them to a pair I had for over ten years (back of the drawer, didn't wear them anymore because they had worn through the toe) and the old socks still looked great (except for the hole). I don't expect them to last more than a year or so, but they were cheap. I don't know if the more expensive ones were better because Gold Toe provides no description differentiating them. If you want a cheap sock with a short lifespan, get these, otherwise look elsewhere. Maybe the retail store socks are of better quality, but again, how are we to tell? Shame on you Gold Toe, what happened to your QC?"
3,"Soft, comfortable, look nice","Soft, fuzzy, stretchy, fairly thick, and they look great. Everything you could want in a sock.I just bought my third 6-pack of these and tossed all my old socks.Update: After a few months, I have to admit, I am getting pretty annoyed with the way they still shed little bits of fuzz everywhere. I still find them comfortable and attractive, but they leave enough balls of fuzz behind after I take them off that the bedroom needs to be vacuumed more frequently than it otherwise might have to. I'm not sure why the cloth sheds so much fuzz, but it still does, even after several washings."
4,"Good socks, nice and warm.","These socks are comfortable, warm and of a good quality material. Hard to ask for more than that! I found they are true to size as well."
3,Nice but they shed all over the carpet,I like Gold Toe socks. They are comfy. Too bad they are such a pain. I am tired of picking up little black pieces of lint off the carpet. I won't be buying these again.
4,very good value,so far socks seem good value well made. It is hard tofind a dark color med. weight good sock in theextra large size at a good price
5,Gold Toe Socks Are The Best,These are the only socks I will purchase. Gold Toe are the most comfortable and they last and last.
4,good socks,they fit and they arrived on time. i would definately buy them again. thank you very much for the socks.
4,Nice socks,"Fairly thick, soft, stay-up well. Not sure how well they ""breath"", as my feet still tend to feel moist. But better than the old socks I had."
1,What happened to the reinforced heel?,"I was really happy when I first discovered these socks and they were really affordable in Costco, yet now when I see them in Macy's or other such stores I am shocked at their poor quality. I hate having to buy new white socks every few months and I wear black socks throughout the week. Who makes a decent pair a white socks?"
2,Athletic but not so strong...,"I ride my bike to work everymorning, and after purchasing an extra size sock, I believed my ""sock problem"" would end. Specially if they were ""athletic quality"". But these keep on opening near the toas! and trust me, it's not a lack of nail clipper!"
5,Great buy,Bought these for my son who was going off to college. Six months later they are still holding up good. He likes them.
2,Macy's gold toe socks,The socks I bought from Macy's via Amazon were overpriced but I needed them so I bought them. I've found they don't fit very well either.
3,Adequate,"Perfectly fine for the price, soft and comfortable, washes well. They must be very absorbent, because they always look like they've had it by the time I've taken them off, but they do ""refresh"" in the wash each time."
2,very slipery,"They must have changed material. I used to like these socks, not any more. I have no idea what has changed, but socks are very slippery"
5,Great product. Good price.,The best type of men's socks I've found for the money. Good fit when new and after several wash cycles.
2,?,"sub'd black for white. i only wear white, not happy about that! if not available, check with customer before sub'ing"
2,Not so good,"I really don't like these sock. They weren't very comfortable and the quality seemed poor. A recent review said the quality has dropped on these socks, so maybe that's the deal. I also recently ordered some Gold Toe Uptown socks, and I love those socks. They are quite possibly the best socks I've ever worn. Clearly Gold Toe knows how to make a good pair of socks, although the Uptown socks are about twice the price, so maybe it's not too surprising."
4,"Quality is down a bit, but they're still good socks","I've been buying Gold Toe socks for my husband for at least seven or eight years. Although we've tried picking up other brands, the Gold Toe are his favorite. The cotton is pretty soft, they stay up around the ankles, they last at least eighteen months, and they don't develop holes too quickly. This most recent pack feels a bit thinner than packs we've bought in the past, but I imagine that they'll still hold up fairly well and won't need replacing for quite some time."
1,What happened?!,"These USED to be my husband's favorite socks. I buy him some every holiday season. Well, some time between last Christmas and this Christmas they must have decided to cheap out on the quality. The new ones I gifted him this Christmas have already started getting holes in the toe after ONE use! He says he noticed the difference in quality before even putting them on and I can as well. The sock material is much thinner with these new ones. I'm extremely disappointed and if I could give 0 I would. When companies decide to cheap out on a great product (which seems to happen more and more these days) it's a real shame."
2,Not for smaller feet.,Not good if your feet are small or lie at the lower end of the supported range. I felt like these socks were slipping off my feet more so than any other socks I have had.
2,These socks are cheap,"These socks are cheap. I thought I was purchasing high quality Gold Toe socks. However, it looks like they just sold their name and branding to some cheap supplier."
4,Good socks.,These are every day tennis shoes socks. They are great for average weather. They won't work in freezing temps. But for the other 8 months of the year they are great.
5,"Great Socks, GREAT bargain!","Excellent product - what more can I say? Husband loves them, they fit nicely and are soft n' comfortable."
3,too tight at top,"The socks seem OK. However, they are much too tight at the top for me to wear. I have a difficult time getting socks that are not too tight at the top, but I have found some over the years that feel comfortable."
4,"Nice, but heads up!","I ordered white socks, but received 3 pr. grey, and 3 pr. black! Just for your info."
2,good item wrong color,I like these socks. They are very comfortable. My problem is I ordered 2 packs of white socks. When I opened the box the shipping slip said white socks and tag on the package said white socks but both packages contained BLACK socks. I think even a color blind person can tell the difference between black and white. Yes I could have returned them but I didn't want to wait another ten days for the correct color. Like I said the socks are great but mistakes like this are inexcusable.
4,Gold Toe Cotton Crew Sock,The only reason I order these socks over their competitor is because I had order some other small items and I wanted to get the free shipping. To my surprise they sold me! I would be more than happy to pay a couple more dollars for these socks verse the Hanes!
3,Not true athletic socks.,I bought these to wear with black workout pants at the gym. They move around on my feet more than they should. They work well as socks to go with black jeans.
5,These are indeed socks.,"They fit nicely and are as warm as I had expected. They're pretty thick, but just fine for summer wear."
1,Big price - poor quality,"I'm not sure if these were 'seconds', but the quality was terrible. The socks pilled, leaving chunks of black fluff everywhere, whenever you took them off. They also showed signs of wear in the heels after only a few times. Will never buy these highly-rated socks again!"
2,"Good price, but...","The price on these socks was good, but it wasn't so clear that they were not 100% cotton. Some of the tops don't cling properly, so I am disappointed.On the other hand, they look good."
3,I think you get what you pay,It's quite a good quality sock for 3 dollar per pair... probably the best value for money sock but not the best sock that I will use for running for 5 k or more... it's more like every day working socks.... what can you expect for 3 dollar per pair... if u expect something better for running I suggest you buy thorlo thick running socks the best socks that I have been using it for a while.
4,Right Thickness,These socks are just the right thickness-not too thick as some. Appear to be good quality and at a good price
5,Pleased..,"They are Good socks, at a good price, I am pleased with this purchase, and I will probably order again."
1,Not what I thought,I looked at several different gold toe socks online and this one appeared to be the thin material. It actually ended up being the heavy thick cotton. I'm ticked.
2,POLIESTER AND DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES.,"I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT WITH POLIESTER AND THE MATERIALS THAT WERE SHOWN ARE: 82% COMBED COTTON, 17% STRETCH NYLON, 1% SPANDEX (SO I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT WITH THESE MATERIALS PLUS POLIESTER AND WITH DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES)."
2,not again,"I know these socks get good reviews but I have bought them numerous times and have had two problems.1. They keep sliding down my leg, they do not stay up.2. The color (black)fades quickly.Maybe it's just me but I will try a different brand next time."
1,"A cut in quality, but not in price","Gold Toe socks used to be 100% cotton, or nearly so. Now they're 17% nylon, and you can feel the difference. They're less breathable, and generally feel cheaper. But they cost as much as ever."
1,Quality way down currently,"I bought a pack of these 2 weeks ago, washed them once normally and today there is already a rip in one of the socks. I did nothing to rip it myself, just noticed a hole there in the ribbing. Not satisfactory at all. Gold Toe seems to be cutting corners or something."
3,durable as hell- not for sensitive skin,"I have to say i bought these socks on amazon 5 years ago and have worn them regularly. I had to junk one pair a year in because of some unsightly toe holes, the rest have been going strong. I recently noticed that the heel is finally wearing out on most of them, which brought me back to amazon to order some replacements. The reason these socks don't get 5 stars is that they are not good for those of us with sensitive skin. I noted within the first few days of wearing them that the elastic or nylon material on the inside of the sock was causing a mild irritant rash to my calves. I almost sent them back, but first tried turning them inside out. Voila! by ering them inside out, no rash, and they have held up very well. 1 star off for giving me a rash, the other star off for having to wear inside out socks for 5 years. Haha, but true."
1,Fabric Content not as listed,"I have worn gold toe athletic socks for over 20 years. These most recent purchase show a remarked change in the fabric content of the socks. They now only contain 78 percent natural cotton fiber instead of 82 percent as recorded in the Amazon ad. The amount of nylon and polyester has increased and so has the spandex. Instead of being manufactured in our neighboring Mexico, they are made in Honduras. I do not like these changes and do not like that the ads on Amazon are not updated so that you can really tell what you are buying."
1,Poor Quality,"I have always purchased Gold Toe extended sizes at JC Penneys but thought I could save myself the trip. I ordered 2 pack (12 pairs) and have been completely disappointed with the quality of the socks. None of the socks are the same-different widths, different heights and the quality is not the same as Penneys. Isn't Gold Toe the manufacturer? I didn't think they would offer a lower quality on the internet. I would return them if offered."
3,"Good, but ....","They're reasonably long (but not as long as the Gold Toe ones with a single gold stripe across the toe that I found at WalMart), comfortable, retain their color after many washings, BUT they fluff a LOT. I've had them for over a year and STILL get big chunks of fluff stuck under my toes and on the soles of my feet when I take them off at the end of the day. You would think they'd stop doing that after the first few washings, but no. I don't think I'd buy them again knowing this. But there's not many options if you want big & tall socks."
2,Gold Toe Men's Cotton Crew Athletic Socks,"I have a love/hate relationship with these socks, which I have worn for several years:1) Most pairs are as described by others: Thick, comfortable and long-lasting. However,2) Of the last six pairs that I bought (having worn three pairs so far) two pairs have developed dime-sized holes in the heels after only 2 - 3 wearings. I have had this problem before with other pairs, but the problem doesn't seem to be consistent. I have to throw the socks out while most of the sock is still in perfectly good condition!I wish the HEELS were reinforced (e.g. ""Gold Heel"") and that the performance was more consistent."
3,Comfy!,"Well they are athletic and therefore 'thick'. You may feel your feet stuffed in your shoes, o yea and sweaty too. Otherwise they are very comfortable."
1,Too Pricey,Returned item after a day. Way too pricey. Found a pair of christening shoes in local mall for $2.99. Returned item to seller.
5,An EXCELLENT way to learn Country Bass,"This book is an excellent resource for learning Country Bass. I was looking for ways to learn more authentic country basslines, and this book/CD was enormously helpful!! A big plus about the CD is the ability to play along with a real band. I am looking forward to trying out Keith Rosier's other book: Jump n' Blues Bass."
2,Cheaply built and it shows.,"Knife handle was not brass colored more of a pewter color, Blade was sharp but had LOTS of slop in it. Looked cheap all around. I sent it back."
4,Beautiful & Sharp,"This is a beautiful little stainless steel lockblade (3 inch blade) made in China, but nowhere on the knife does it say this. Instead, it says Sheffield. Brass plated zinc handle with polished hardwood having a dark pumpkin-orange coloring. Very pretty to look at and has a great weight. Feels good in the hand."
3,Give Sam Buddy Miller's Number!!!,"This record should have been done without ANY guests! Mariah Carey's vocals on ""Make Believe"" ruin the track...Sam sounds great throughout-Call Buddy Miller!!!!"
2,Not all duets are made in Heaven....,"Sam's voice is still in decent shape, but this set is just awkward. Star studded album isn't always the best way to cash in on an againg star. The last great album Sam did was over 30 years ago and that's the one you need to get (Plenty Good Lovin': The Lost Solo Album).I like quite a few stars that appear here, but that's not a good enough reason for me to buy this album. The selection of songs (and guest artists) is just strange, and doesn't work for me. Three star rating for the voice, one for the album = 2 :(If you're into aging soul star revival, go listen to a phenomenal Solomon Burke's last few albums (especially 2002 Don't Give Up On Me)."
5,He's still got it!,"This is absolutely classic Sam Moore. Having been a long time fan of Sam and Dave, I was a bit hesitant to make this purchase, thinking that it would never live up to the soul duo. But it does. He is absolutely amazing! And the guest artists all turn in wonderful performances. Just a wonderful CD. You will pleased to know that he hasn't lost a thing!"
4,"How great to ""see"" Sam Moore again!","It's so great to have another Sam Moore product that I can overlook the less-than-dazzling choice of music; his voice makes anything sparkle. And although the record company apparently thought they needed to reinforce him with more recently famous singers, I would have been more pleased with Pure Sam.That said, it's high time Sam Moore gets a little more celebrity, and if this album attracts that kind of attention, Moore the better. I hope we will hear far Moore from this immensely talented man!"
1,"Good binding, questionable content","The binding is fair quality and survived a semester of use, probably earning 4 or 5 stars on its own. This book is a collaborative work among many theological scholars. Many of the authors are widely recognized as experts in their respective theological interests. Their other works should be read with great seriousness.The reason this work is rated 2 stars is my basic disagreement both on theological method used by the authors and the theological conclusions drawn by the authors. This work is anthropocentric at its core. The text is more about humanity and the human condition than it is about the divine. If this book were classified as a book of religious anthropology, I may rate it 4 stars. I simply cannot call it (the whole book) theology in the classical sense. I would not recommend this text to anyone, even those whose theologies tend to agree with the authors. There is more hubris than theology in this text."
4,Something new...,"I grabbed a copy of this at the local bookseller recently. Experimental Architecture is a small volume showcasing a handful of inovative projects (mostly homes). I have been working with copper cladding systems a bit latley and several projects in this book feature copper in their exteriors. Due to its small size, the photos and drawings in the book are of little use for detailed study. Still for what it's worth, I found some projects interesting enough to warrant further research on the web and other publications.Solid four stars for a broad range of projects and a clear, if small layout."
3,Good pocket guide for amateurs and kids,"Great pictures, good information on recognition and range. Fits in a pocket. Great for kids to hold, flip through and carry in the house or outdoors. Great fun."
1,MilkShake was a Disastor - AWFUL AWFUL,".Aug 30 2005 - from JWA -.I used one (1) tsp. (teaspoon) in 15 ounces of milk and vanilla iceCream - UGGH!.It tasted like medicine. NOT pleasant medicine..There are NO instructions on the bottle (2 0z. Oil Soluable Root Beer Flavor - OldHickory Brand)..I then tried LOTS of Hershey syrup to salvage the iceCream (no more in frig) - it still tasted BAD..TOO BAD!! I used to LOVE RootBeer flavored MilkShakes made with RootBeer syrup rather than actual RootBeer - MUCH more concentrated flavor. Now A&W; no longer stocks the syrup..JWA - PierPort, Michigan.."
4,A great extra battery for LX3,It works great with Lumix LX3 camera I just bought. Now I can go on shooting without worrying about running out of battery. One extra spare one is always nice to have.
3,Be careful....,"Like a previous reviewer warned:This is NOT the correct battery for the Panasonic FX55. It doesn't claim to be, but the ""Customers Ultimately Buy..."" and ""Customers who bought this also bought..."" features might lead you to believe it is (it happened to me, anyway.) 3 stars because I haven't actually been able to use it- it appears to be a quality battery. If Lenmar makes one for the FX55, I'll buy it."
3,Be careful...,"This is NOT the correct battery for the Panasonic TZ1. It doesn't claim to be, but the ""Customers Ultimately Buy..."" feature might lead you to believe it is (it happened to me, anyway.) (3 stars because I haven't actually been able to use it- it probably works fine in a camera that it fits into...)"
1,Unable to use battery,I bought a camera for my daughter and Amazon offered me an extra battery which I bought but it did not fit the camera. When I unwrapped the battery and tried to put it in the camera it was too big. They should know better before making recommendations.
1,"they recommended it, but he is not the adapted one for the camera","they recommended it, but he is not the adapted one for the camera"
1,Digital battery,Product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery. As of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card. How would you rate my review?
3,Chinese perspective - very circular in nature.,"The book has some very good facts and concepts about Chinese culture and consumers. However, it is very Chinese in its writing style - not linear but very circular. The author covers issues in somewhat random order and occasionaly covers the same concept multiple times. He leaves it up to the reader to sort out the infomation."
5,A great portrait of chinease consummer in the 21st cent,"The book has some very good facts and concepts about Chinese culture and consumers. However, it is very Chinese in its writing style - not linear but very circular. The author covers issues in somewhat random order and occasionaly covers the same concept multiple times. He leaves it up to the reader to sort out the infomation. It reads easily and is full of interesting thoughts and ideas on how to penetrate the largest market of the 21st century. We recommend this book to all of our clients who are thinking about exporting to, or establishing an operation within China."
1,"""Bedtime Story"" from Movie Mars Inc via Amazon","I ordered the movie Bedtime Story from Movie Mars Inc and they sent me a PAL version which I am unable to watch on my DVD players. Very frustrating. Unable to contact anyone at Movie Mars other than by email. I could download a return form, fill it out, and take it to a post office to return it, but don't consider it worth the hassle. As for the movie, it was the original Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with David Niven and Marlin Brando. A great movie which no one seems to know about. I would still like an NTSC version, but don't trust them now."
1,surprise,I am very disappointed in this movie. I waited over a month just to receive a movie I can't play. I didn't know that there were different codes for dvd players and that you could buy movies that required a different dvd player..
2,I was disappointed in the quality of the disc.,"I ordered the DVD ""Bedtime Story"" because I had seen the movie back in 1964 or 1965 and enjoyed it very much. I couldn't find the movie anywhere, not even Netflix. So when I saw that it was available on Amazon I was anxious to order it.Unfortunately the copy that I received was very poor quality. The picture was distorted and was very hard to see. I was still able to follow the story and still enjoyed the story line even though the picture was poor.If anyone is interested in the story, the movie ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" is a remake of ""Bedtime Story"" and I actually liked it better than the original."
2,A little disapointing.,"Won't play on our main DVD player. But, it will play on our 5"" portable, and on the computer. So it's not a movie night movie."
4,a rare movie,"The movie is excellent, but the dvd was formatted so I could only watch it on my computer.I would like to have known that prior to purchase. Otherwise, no complaints."
2,All Regions?,"Hmmm. Well, it's a good thing I've already seen this film, cause it's not compatable with my DVP-NS55P Sony DVD player. All regions? I don't think so."
4,"MUCH Better Than ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels""!","See this movie AND THEN see ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" a remake of ""Bedtime Story."" I think you'll agree that the remake is inferior and the original is FAR funnier. I cry with laughter every time I see the scene in which David Niven whips Marlon Brando!Who was that wise moviemaker who said, ""Don't remake GOOD movies; remake BAD movies""? Sam Goldwyn? In any event, ""Bedtime Story"" DIDN'T need to be remade."
1,Bedtime Story Very poor transfer to DVD,"I have always enjoyed this movie which was redone as ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"". Unfortunately, the picture quality as transferred to DVD is so poor that it is not worth watching the tape."
3,"Mandatory text, great condition","Excellent condition, as advertised, and delivered promptly. The book itself I don't care for, but it's a required text for class, so...."
1,Dissapointing,"I is more of a amateur video and ain't worth a $ 1/=, stick to National Geographic instead and I don't recomend anyone buying it."
1,I blame it on myself,"I did not read the reviews and I ended up with a Disneyish , New age collage of animals primed with soothing music. The only thing missing was a rendition of Kumbayah to go with it. It was boring and I expected Narration. Again thats my fault . OK but even so, this was so PC it was not even funny. Well it was funny, the joke was on myself for buying this trashy piece of garbage. They showed no kills, no mating, not even animals eating their kill. To call this THE ULTIMATE SAFARI is misleading. I would think at an ultimate safari you would experience the things I mentioned. Save your money on this one."
5,Panaracer Pasela Tourguard 26 x 1.25 Black/Tan Kevlar Bead,"I am quite happy with this tire. Still kinda new to me as I have put only few hundred miles on it so far with no flats! Very good quality. Thread pattern has felt good for traction, control & ride quality. I have pumped them to the full 95psi specification."
5,great series,I enjoyed this series and look forward to the others. It was funny and dramatic all at the same time
5,My go-to mystery series,"When I am missing England, I tune in for an Oxford fix. Not to mention Robbie's tortured integrity and Hathaway's rapier wit. Writing intelligent and entertaining; background flawlessly shot. If only all TV could be this good..."
2,"Nope, not for me.",It's really hard to follow Morse and I suppose it was hard for me to keep my interest. Lewis is Morse's sidekick. He did not sell me as a man in authority.
5,Inspector Morse is Great!,"This show is wonderful. Its interesting and I love trying to solve who did it. Keep this show coming., I love watching it everytime it is on."
5,Great Show,"Love this show alot. Great plots, great acting. Nothing like a classic British murder mystery to spend the evening with"
3,"Wonderful, but where's the pilot episode?","I love Inspector Lewis and Hathaway--yes, he is rather dishy. I actually enjoy this series more than I did Morse. Lewis is much more approachable and the relationship between the mentoring relationship Lewis has to Hathaway is very well done and believable.My complaint with the streaming version is -- WHERE'S THE PILOT EPISODE???? I really hate coming in partway into the story. I know the pilot is available on the DVD, so why not on the streaming version?"
4,Covered the damage,"I have repaired our wall 3 times already and painted it each time. We used various door stoppers but something always caused a fail (usually children!). I wasn't crazy about the color of this, so I painted it to match the wall. It blends right in, covers the damage and was SUPER easy to put up. My wall looks much better now and I don't expect another hole anytime soon."
3,WHY ARE THE FAITHS AT ODDS?,"This book is made up of papers on Muslim-Christian issues, submitted by a variety of authors. Topics cover women in Islam, human rights, and, of course, differences between the two faiths. The book's first half covers political and social issues, while the second looks at deeper theological matters.As with any book of this type, some chapters and writers are better than others. The best chapters focus on Christian -Muslim perceptions of each other, and the question of whether Islam sees itself as an abrogation of Christian truth. The poorest chapter addresses the threat of Christianity to Islam. Here the author chooses to ignore the subject altogether! His article is dull, confusing and inexplicable. The book also suffers from an intellectual bias. Most Muslims and Christians would be somewhat less tolerant and liberal than these writers."
5,great quality poster,"This poster is printed on heavy stock that doesn't wrinkle and bend like others i have gotten. It was sent in a heavy tube to protect it. The only problem wa the odd size, trying to find a frame."
5,Best stapler!,This stapler is the best I've owned. I loved the color of this stapler so I bought it and when I got it I was very please with how well it is made. The purple part is rubberized. It staples easilly and does quite a few pieces of paper without any problems. I would recommend this stapler.
2,Not her best,I love SEP but this was not a great book. ...Lady Be good was her best. This was her weakest. Somehow I got lost in all the characters...I never grew a liking for Phoebe and Dan. Ron seemed to come out as the real hero here.
1,First and last book I'll read by SEP,"After all the positive reviews, I decided to read a book by this author - a total waste of my time and money. I agree with all the other negative reviews of this book. The characters are unrealistic and unbelieveable. The sex scenes are disturbing. I'd give this book a negative 5 stars if I could."
1,Worst trashy novel ever!,I will never again pick up another novel by SEP - and to say it is rated 5 stars?! This was my first and my last!
5,really like the book,"I really enjoyed this book, from begining to end. It was funny, sexy just a great story line. found you rooting for the both of them."
2,Good book but...,I didn't care for the racial slur. Not sure it was necessary for the story. It was just distracting. Otherwise I enjoyed it.
4,very good movie-ish plot,"This is the 1st book in the chicago stars series and I read it last, I sort of read the series backwards, so it'll probably affect my review. I think this is a very touching book, and I like how Phillips didn't use her usual conflict. Here both characters have the same rate on the development of their feelings for each other. I think that's perfect, because Dan here is really looking forward to settle down as opposed to the other Phillips' heroes who marries the heroine out of honor/principles. What I dont really like about it is the climax where Phoebe got abducted so Dan could lose the game for her. And of course the double touchdown when there's only 2 minutes in the clock. That's not original. I think it'll look better in a movie than in a book. Anyway, I still like how Phillips balanced Dan scenes(point of views) with Phoebe's, especially ending the book through Dan's eyes. It is a feel-good ending, she didn't overdone it or anything--just right."
5,"Sassy, smart, funny - great characters","I fell in love with Phoebe Sommerville and Dan Calebow and pretty much the entire cast of this book. Phoebe is the new owner of the Chicago Stars football team; Dan is its head coach, and since she knows nothing about the game and isn't interested in learning, the two knock heads from the very beginning. But gradually, admiration and respect develop. The dialogue is right up there with the best of SEP and Jennifer Crusie - an absolute delight. You can't help but enjoy the entire football team - Phillips paints them beautifully. The scene near the end where Dan erases some of Phoebe's bad memories was a hoot of an idea and very well crafted.The only negative for me was Dan's yelling so much. I don't care if he was the hottest football coach going - verbal abuse is emotional abuse. SEP gave reasons for his short temper, and he did recognize his flaws and mellow, but it was jarring nonetheless."
3,Could have been better,I didn't really like this one like Susan Elizabeth Phillips's other novels. I really don't now why because I'm a big fan of hers. This Heart of Mine and Dream a Little Dream are way better than this.
3,"Not as good as HEAVEN, TEXAS","Unfortunately before I read this book, I read one of its sequels called HEAVEN, TEXAS. Maybe if I had read this particular one first I could have rated it at least 4 stars. Unlike HEAVEN, I never felt a real spark between the two main characters, nor did I particularly ever come to like the hero. The heroine was pleasant and I came to understand why she acted the way she did and truly came to care for her. However, the hero, Dan, never really seemed like that great of a guy. My heart didn't leap for joy when the two finally got together. I kept thinking that Dan didn't deserve Phoebe. Overall, it was a good book, but definitely not SEP's best."
2,"Interesting, but not the best","Sorry if I don't agree with everyone else on this book. Maybe it is because I am not into sports. This book had too much football in it for me to be totally absorbed by the story. Now, SEP can really write, but this wouldn't be on my list of top 10 favorites."
4,It all started when...,"Phoebe Somerville inherited the Chicago Stars from her no good father amid incredible controversy. Phoebe tries to make the best of it in spite of the opposition she's facing. Heading the opposition is the gorgeous Dan Calebow. Dan Calebow is the Stars head coach and when he meets the Marilyn-esque Phoebe he is immediately attracted to her although he doesn't respect her. Because of her looks and a traumatizing past experience, Phoebe plays the part of the bimbo to the max. It takes Dan a while to see through her charade and find out that there's a brain to go with the dazzling good looks.It Had to Be You is the first of the Chicago Stars books and the last one I read ( I worked my way back for some reason ) it is probably not as well paced as the rest but it was one of her first books but regardless this is a great read and it is a nice introduction to this brilliant author and her excellent stories. If you like SEP do not miss this one!"
5,"Love it,love it, LOVE IT!!!","This was the first SEP book I ever read and have read it several times. The author's ability to blend the humorous and bawdy, the silly and romantic, and the sheer beauty of a well-told story is unsurpassable. Phoebe and Dan are unforgettable and their story wonderful. Already reviewers have recapped the entire book over and over in their blurbs but I'll just say this...Read this book. You'll fall in love. (Note: SEP created the ficional Chicago Stars football team for this book and the team and players are mentioned in other books as well.)"
2,Not So Sweet or Nice,"This is a romantic comedy with a mainstream touch that was shockingly coarse for its day (originally published in 1994) but is nothing compared to the language and behavior in today's paranormals. I skimmed all the football details. I skimmed much of the sex. I did not skim the interpersonal relationship scenes between the main good guy characters, which were both lively and interesting. For all I know, the football and the sex were lively and interesting, too, but not to me when I don't like the characters much.And that was the problem. I don't like a male lead who is such an alpha that anger is his only emotion. I don't like men who are bullies. I don't think they are funny, because they are not. The story did have its funny moments, and it was deftly written. And it had a happy ending. But I doubt I'll be reading any more by this author."
4,"Good, but hated the unbelievable climax.","There are so many things to like about this book. The lead characters were funny, complex and engaging. Most of the plot was interesting. Unlike some reviewers, I was not turned off by Phoebe's over-the-top bimbo act. I thought it was consistent with her past experiences, and it was a refreshing change from the heroine who's unattractive or doesn't know how to use her sexuality. My main beef with this book was the hokey, unbelievable climax, where Dan essentially proves his love for Phoebe by being willing to throw the AFC Championship game. Not at all credible, and actually a little disgusting, when you think about it. If you love or are knowledgeable about the NFL, you will hate this book. Otherwise, I recommend it."
2,"Pretty depressing, unless you don't mind rape as the focus","I almost stopped reading when I read about rape, parental abuse and sex with minors. I continued reading because I needed a good ending to remove the bad images from my brain. In the end the victim kind of has a new beginning in life but it was not enough to compensate for the awful story. If I want to feel depressed I'll turn on the news."
5,Great start to a great series!,"I've been reading the football series out of order and this is the book that started it all. The book was a typical SEP read with wit and humor in abundance. Dan and Phoebe were perfect together and the romance left me sighing for more. The highlight of this book is the change the character of Phoebe underwent. It kept me turning the pages and riveted till the very end! Also, read her latest in the football series called Match me if you can and you will be a SEP fan for life!"
4,Good book,What can I say? Susan Elizabeth Phillips is my guilty pleasure. I love her books and this was no exception.
5,Nothing says fall like a football series,"When fall comes around, and football is the sport being played. I pull out the this series and and read them all. Needed this one on my Kindle, so I could take it on trips"
5,LOVE!,"I have this in paperback form, but wanted it for my Kindle because I absolutely LOVE Susan's books! I can't say enough about her books-they always deliver a great time!"
5,Intelligent modern romance!,"I am a huge SEP fan and I love her ""Stars"" series. Her characters are great and multi-dimensional. Phoebe is one of my favorite of SEP's heroines. Thank you, SEP, for writing great books. One suggestion... You write well, so there is no need to name a famous person whom our heroes and heroines resemble (Marilyn Monroe, etc.). Am I the only one who noticed that she always does this?"
4,A Good One,"I have now read all of the books in the Chicago Stars/Bonner Brothers series, and, as someone else noted in another review, it's inadvisable to read them back-to-back. Read them over time. This is the first in the series, and SEP writes a good story, filled with colorful and interesting characters. I do recommend this book, but I strongly encourage you to wait a few weeks or even longer if you like, before going on to the next book (Heaven, Texas). My only real complaint is that the heroines always fall in love first and then have to wait for the hero to come to his senses. In the process of waiting, both characters do some really dumb (and in most cases, on the part of the hero, hurtful) stuff until all is well in the end.We need a little Robyn Carr'sVirgin River (Virgin River, Book 1)-type hero who falls head over heels for the heroine long before she'll give him a second glance. If I wanted to read about women being treated badly, I wouldn't be reading fiction."
3,What happened?,"I ordered this book because of all the great reviews. It took me a while to get into it, but once I did, I really started to like it. And then the end came....I couldn't have been more dissapointed. The end of this book had so much going on, and so much of it was completely ridiculous, that I just couldn't wrap my head around it. I don't want to ruin it for everyone, so I won't give you specifics. I can only tell you that once the last game begun, I was completely put off by how quickly and ridiculously the story played out. Susan Elizabeth Phillips has it in her to be a good writer, I just don't think this was her best work."
1,Not what I expected.,Very disappointed in the book from the start. I would never recommend it. Plot was under developed and there were lots of holes.
5,Like it,I like reading her book their funny and cute. Like how she makes the women fisty and smart nut has them not show it. But the next books of hers I read was grate and had to buy them for my kindl I read them so much the pages are worn.
2,Not very durable,"If you want a cheap and simple mat, this may do the trick. However, it is pretty thin and not very durable. Pieces of it wear off over time, and if you happen to wear sneakers on it (I know, it's a yoga mat) then you'll be finding little pieces of this mat on your floor."
4,A Great & Challenging Workout!,DVD arrived the same week packaged and new as promised. This is a great and challenging addition to my Baron collection. I recommend it to masochists in search of 8-pack abs.Baron Baptiste Live!: Core Power
4,Does what I wanted it to do.,"This is the mat I use at home and at the center where I take lessons. I can tell you right now that this mat works MUCH better on a hard surface (like as in wood) than it does on carpet. It should also be noted that this mat is thinner than a lot of the mats available now. When I first began, I wanted a thicker mat. Now that I have been working at this stuff for quite some time I have found the thinner mat suits my needs better. It gives enough cushion so that it is not painful and the thinness seems to allow for freer movement...maybe that is just me.The price here is quite nice and is one of the reason I first bought it...I figured that if I did not like it, I was not out all that much. I have noted that our local stores do not like to take back used yoga mats. Go figure.Is this the best mat I have ever use? No. Will I replace it with others? Yes. Does it do the job I want it for at this time in my life? Yes."
1,this mat has an objectionable odor,"This mat stinks of some kind of off-gassing plastic. It smells so bad that I had to put it outside. I hope the smell will go away. And, no, I am not that sensitive. But this really reeks. I will give it a day and decide whether to keep it.I will raise the rating if the smell goes away."
3,Valeo yoga mat,"This item is not one of the best yoga mats but it does the deed. I mistakenly used sneakers and pressed the mat so hard it actually got rubbed down so I had to flip it. Barely any cushion so it is not comfortable but is effective for doing quick positions. I would not recommend this if you want a long term yoga mat. Get something sturdier and thicker.**Update: Dec 2012, I still use this mat for simple exercises and I have changed my mind in having this as a longer term yoga mat so I gave it another star!"
3,Cheap,"Bought these for my kids based on the cool colors, so I wasn't really expecting much, but they are ""plasticky"". If I had purchased for my own yoga practice (instead of just fooling around) I would have sent them back."
3,Not good on my brick floors,"The mat makes doing yoga slightly more bearable on my brick floors, but it squishes down when I'm holding a pose, or repeating a pose. This makes positions like plank very painful after a while. My floors are more uncomfortable than most, and I think I'm going to have to get a higher-quality mat."
4,Pretty good,"I actually really like this mat! It's not the sturdiest mat ever, but it does the job for me. I'm not a sophisticated yoga practitioner, but I do some light stuff and pilates, so it works fine for me. The only thing that got to me, though, was the smell. I guess the material wrapped up in a plastic bag would smell like that at first, so hopefully it fades over time."
2,Slippery yoga mat,"My entire yoga mat has a greasy film to it (both sides) that has't come off. It is a very light film, but it is still enough that my hands/feet slide a bit (especially noticeable when in down-dog). Have never had this issue with other mats I own, which have all been different brands; so, I don't (and will never) know if it is a fluke as I will not purchase their mats again."
2,Yoga Mat Review,"I'm slightly disappointed with this. My hands tend to get sweaty and slip while in certain yoga positions (down dog, etc.), and I had hoped this mat would alleviate that, but it doesn't. My hands and bare feet slip on this too. I wear weight lifting gloves now to prevent slipping. I still use the mat as it helps to somewhat cushion my body and my lower back, but would not purchase another like it. It may work better on a bare floor than on carpet. There are 2 of these in a local recreation center where I also workout and they are fine there."
2,only an okay mat,"this mat is sufficient for doing yoga. however, your hands slip a lot while trying to hold downward dog... which being one of the main poses... poses a problem. i just grip with my fingers harder on the mat and it works. it's my own fault for buying the cheapo mat... but otherwise it's fine. thickness is good for me, i don't like super thick mats. length is good. but the biggest problem is the slippage. i mean your hands and feet can't help but get at least a tiny bit slippery from sweat which leaves you sliding. this mat = bad call. go for more expensive, better quality. if you can buy one in person so you can feel it. probably a much wiser decision."
3,"Okay for push ups, not good for sit ups","I bought this mat primarily because it is painful doing sit ups on the bare floor. With this mat, which is quite thin, my tail bone still hurts after doing sit ups, though the soreness tends to come a bit later than it would on a bare floor. The foam is really squishy and stays deformed for a while, but eventually returns to its original shape.One big gripe I have is the smell! It smells like cheap rubber/plastic, and the smell remains there until you air it out for a week or two. Definitely should've invested a few more bucks in a thicker, less smelly mat."
1,I hate this mat!,"I strongly dislike, even hate, this mat!I purchased it because of the good price but that was a waste of money.I've been doing yoga for over a week with this mat (to make sure that I didn't just need some""getting used to"").It is does not provide a lot of cushioning; not even a towel helps to make it more cushion-y.It is stated that it's a 1/8in thick mat, but compared to the one that I used to have before, it's very bad quality.I cannot return it since I opened it and used it but now I gotta buy another mat, preferably a 1/4in one.So don't waste your money and do not get fooled by the price!"
3,not awful,"i got this about a year ago as a present. i love the person who bought it for me, but the gift itself was a little disappointing.firstly, the color is kinda blah. it's just this dull stale purple. ok whatever.because of that, i actually have no used it that many times, maybe just a handful. even so, every time i used it, i noticed some of mat flaking off. little purple bits left on the floor after i shake out my mat. this happen more if i try to clean it and wipe it down with some spray and paper towel.now i just use it for in front of my cat's litter box to trap tracked litter. for that it's ok, although not great either."
1,Worst yoga mat,I purchased this within the last week or two and it's already falling apart. The material is so poorly made that it degrades while you're in a yoga pose and gets all over the floor. I have to buy another one now
4,Great mat for the price,"Good buy, I've been using this mat for almost a year now (although not on a daily basis) and it is still in great shape. Would recommend it."
5,"Almost twice as big as OEM, but it lasts even longer","It almost doubles the size of the camcorder, certainly balances it. This new battery has all the life that the OEM has lost."
4,an amazing record,"this record is pure noise - meant in the sense that the frequency's have all been baptized, and they will go to heaven.completely at home and masterful in composing in the digital realm- pita evokes beautiful ensembles of melody and often rhythm within a general structure of high frequency noise, often creating a tastefully playful stereo field that lulls the senses despite being at times purposefully abrasive. the entire record feels very complete - with each track playing its own unique role in this shiny metal drama."
2,for knowledge of the label & $5 i purchased this record.....,"..and found only 2 tracks really worth salvaging off this recording: ""Untitled 5"" and ""Untitled 8"". they are the only pieces that maintain my interest by displaying a nice texture that continues to grow not gradually, but rather by it's own mutation. the rest are just your standard fare of IDM noise that really seem to trial to nowhere. nothing new makes it boring, really.for other work using ""pure tone"" methods, try recordings by Aube, NON's ""Blood & Flame"", Disc (basically it's the Lesser guy i'm told), Halfer Trio and recent Jim O'Rourke recordings."
4,Enlisted pilots' history,"If you want to know about the history of the ""flying sergeants"", this is the book you are looking for. This book is ""the reference"" and as stated in the comments section, it is very popular with the U.S. Air Force, and is currently being given to attendees of the NCO Academy. The book is considered by the USAF as essential to Non-commisioned officer (NCO) Profession-of-Arms(POA) training. Certainly, if you are looking for in-depth history of the Army Air Corps, or the roots of the USAF, this book is a must. Besides all of that, it was fun to read."
5,A must-have book for the river smallmouth enthusiast!,This is a book which you will refer to time and time again. It is my most often referred to book on fly fishing. Murray presents a fine balance of practical advice with stories of his experiences on the streams of Virginia. He is the authority on the subject.
4,Fishing for SmallMouth,"This is a very well written book on how to fish for smallmouth bass, what they feed on and how to imitate these food items. There are fancier books out there but I doubt many have as much valuable information as this book. Should be in every warm waterfly fly fisherman's library."
4,One rockin' disc......,"Apparently just a repackaging of the ""Bazooka"" album for the European market. So see below, my review for the Bazooka album:Man does this CD rock & with tons of class to boot. With guest appearances from Steve Lukather & Bobbie Kimball (TOTO), Rick Derringer, and Tony Franklin only adding to the smoke of this fiery disc.The first track ""Evil"" is worth the price of the disc alone. This track is also on the Travers & Appice ""Live At The House Of Blues"" CD & DVD. The Live CD/DVD is also a real smoker.PT revisits some of his classics (Crash & Burn, Boom Boom, Snortin Whiskey) as does Carmine with ""Livin' Alone (an old Beck, Bogart, Appice tune), plus some remakes (Superstitious, Politician, Last Child w/Bobby Kimball vocals & Steve Lukather guitar) and some new tunes (Bazooka w/Rick Derringer guitar, Disappear,Babylon Baby, and Misfortunate One) .Overall, a real solid effort from these two rock veterans who have easily surpassed their debut (""It Takes A Lot Of Balls"")"
5,The most important book in Australian HIstory?,"This is arguably the most important book in Australian history. It is based around the Aboriginal resistance in Sydney encountered by the first fleet. Until this was published resistance stories were ommitted from Australian history. After reading this 'novel' my whole outlook on Australia's history changed. I have since researched Pemulwuy and the Eora resistance and every major event in this book actually happened, it is only a 'novel' because some of the major characters were constructed to make this a more personal story.This book is written somewhat differently and after talking about it with some friends (including some international students) they all say it's uniqueness is WIllmot's Aboriginal storyteller style which makes it easy to read."
5,CLASSIC!!!!!!!,"I have known this tape ever since I was 2 years old and ever since then I have loved it even now! This is a classic for any child! If you give this to them, they'll remember it for the rest of their lives!"
4,Interesting....but leaves a question unanswered.,"I found this book at a local ""Good Will"". I was drawn to the title and the very benign cover. I did find it to be a very fascinating read. I do believe Marcussen is sincere in his belief and faith in God, and he should under no circumstances be condemned at any level for writing this. He does not pass judgement on those who aren't aware of what he writes. He does leave a question unanswered. Why Saturday? He says that Sunday is the ""Day Of The Sun"" which falls under Pagan tradition. But what does Saturday translate too, and why Saturday over any other day of the week. Nevertheless, Marcussens book makes worthy further investigation and research on the subject. If a National Sunday Law would come to pass, I agree it should be rejected if for no other reason than many people've had it up to here with all of this ""nationalization"" nonsense."
1,I weep for the trees that were wasted to make this,This arrived unsolicited in my mailbox and went straight to the recycling bin. If you're going to spam me at least use electronic means that waste less resources.
1,"If you don't keep the sabbath, your an antichrist?","I could only read so much of this book, until the author starts twisting scriptures. The author tries to make a case from the book of Daniel regarding the prophecy of ""changing of times and seasons"" He states that this prophecy began with Christians moving the Sabbath to Sunday. He also believes that when the blue law became ineffective, it was the workings of the antichrist to prevent the Sabbath from being a holy day. I truly believe that going to a restaurant on Sunday doesnt mean that we are antichrists. This book is ridiculous!"
1,This book is published by the Seventh-Day Adventists.,"Since another review asked the question of where this book came from, I'll tell you: Seventh-Day Adventists. It's a little bit too heavy on conspiracy theory for my tastes. I put it down when it started calling the Roman Catholic Church satanic."
1,Pure Propaganda - Little Scriptural/Historical Knowledge,"This is another free 7th Day Adventist Book that was sent to me by mail. Less of a book and more a piece of poorly written (14 font) propaganda. The author attempts to use pieces of the book of Revelation (and other parts of the Bible) to draw the simple conclusion that those that don't practice the Sabbath on Saturday are in sin and promoting the cause of the anti-christ. Not only that but the big revelation that is put forth is that the anti-christ is in fact the Pope. Not a particular Pope mind you, but any one who holds the office.If you are a 7th Day Adventist, I recommend you study the New Testament a bit more and listen to what Jesus said. Is it a coincidence that Jesus reiterated/restated 9 of the 10 commandments? The sabbath being the only one he didn't confirm because 'the sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.'"
3,Not handed out like candy,"National Sunday Law, a Shocking Glimpse Behing the Scenes, Forces Unite Amid Stupendous Crisis...This book does not enjoy 100% acceptance by the Seventh-day Adventist Church because it contains some academic errors. However, it does make many good points and can lead to further study on the important subject. It is incredibly popular."
1,Great comedy,"I laughed until I cried. But after the first 20 pages or so, I realized that this guy was SERIOUS. Then, I just plain cried. People actually BELIEVE THIS! When I found this in my mailbox, I immediately thought it was one of my friends playing a joke on me. Oh well.........I was wrong; particularly after I read some of the five star reviews. By the way - do you know you must give at least one star??A. Jan Marcussen - I know God will forgive you but He may have a few insights for you once you leave this world and enter His."
2,transparent,"Okay. This arrived in my mail. I wonder how many other neighbors have gotten it also. I read it with interest, I've long been interested in eschatology.At first, it was good, it gave good biblical quotes why the catholic church is not the real church. But then they mentioned Sunday as not being the legitimate day of worship, then casually dropped in the bible supposedly doesn't want us eating animals. I had visited a sda church and recognized this right away.The mark of the beast. I have read many theories on this. But to say its Sunday worship? Nah, not buying it.Hey, its free, so enjoy the read, but only a SDA would enjoy it."
1,Sunday Worship,"Please read this article supporting Sunday worship. Basically, Christians worship on Sunday. Jesus, was originally a Jew, so he worshipped on Saturday in Israel. It has to do with the Mosaic Law calendar, which according to the article, people in that region practice to this day. The Holy Bible substantiates worshipping on Saturday. If you have a question about the bible or Christianity, you must always go back to the written word, The Holy Bible, for the answers to your questions. It is the FINAL WORD of GOD. Some religions and/or denominations do not always practice this. Keep this in mind when doing your bible study/research.Here's the article:http://www.bible-truth.org/FAQ-Bible.html#007"
4,Nursing Theories and Nursing Practice,This was not the latest edition but it was written well so it is easy to understand. I'm glad I got this book because it helped me go through my theories class.
1,stapler jams!!,"This was my worst purchase ever, and I make quite a few! Jammed and can no longer be used! Stay away!"
1,Jams,I cannot make this stapler work without it jamming. I am using Swingline Premium SF4 staples. Even just stapling one sheet of paper creates a jam.
1,piece of junk.,"This stapler worked great for about a week, super solid, then it got completely jammed up. The staples wouldn't move to the front unless I lifted up the top every single time I wanted to use it -- so frustrating! It never worked right again. What a waste."
1,Out of the box not working,I've used these type of staplers for many years without a problem. This one came out of the box not working.
1,Worst stapler ever -- total downturn in quality,"This model stapler used to be a classic of desktop dependability, but no longer. The one we received is HORRIBLE -- 2 out of 3 stapling attempts result in a staple jammed inside the stapler head, or only one leg of staple penetrating the paper, or badly mis-formed staple legs. Close inspection of the stapler head reveals poorly fitting, mis-aligned parts. Have just replaced it with a Swingline ""Smooth Grip"" stapler -- works great, less expensive. In the end, it's only a stapler, so just pick one that works and go with it!"
1,jams all the time,I threw out this stapler after a month because it would jam EVERY time it was used. It was useless.
5,Good stapler.,"Very sturdy, looks good, and has not jammed on me or gave me problems so far. It's only limited by the amount of pages it can staple, but what stapler isn't?"
1,Cheap and Cheesy,"This piece of trash shouldn't be allowed to bear the Swingline name. It's awful. At $8.00 and change I guess I can't expect much. Once in a while it would staple correctly. Most of the time it jammed and the staple had to be extracted from the mechanism with needle-nosed pliers. Rather than messing with a return and/or exchange, I gave it a new home: the trash can. My comment on this item: caveat emptor. Were it possible, I'd give it a zero star rating."
3,Underwhelming,"It looks and feels great (heavy and solid), but it doesn't do very well with more than a couple sheets of paper. If I need to staple even six or seven sheets, I end up grabbing a cheap, plastic stapler from a colleague's desk because this one screws up the staple. For whatever reason, the staple doesn't back back all the way if there are more than about five sheets of paper."
1,Stapler Jams,"Purchased this to use in our home office, and have had nothing but trouble with it jamming. Am using Swingline staples in it. Didn't expect this from a Swingline commercial stapler."
2,better than the worst,I have two of these in the office. I was disappointed to see that they are from China. Almost every day and I have to stop what I am doing to pick staples out of one of them because they get jammed. They are not as bad as the junk I used to buy at Wal-Mart and then throw in the trash but not as good as the old Swingline I have at home. It is over thirty years old and works fine. I wish the new ones were that good.
3,Alright I guess....,"the product came in a convenient package and well put in, but it kinda (maybe not) seems like its been used or already opened and it came with no staples.....but I guess all that doesn't really matter because it is just a stapler. So 3 stars is good for it."
5,A handy tool:,"I needed a stapler that I could also use for a 'tacker', without paying a too high price and because I don't have a car, it is a problem trying to shop when others bring me as I like to check out prices, etc. without being rushed. I found this on-line and this was the best price and it was what I wanted. It is very easy to load and to use, so I am happy with it. I doubt that it would be good for an office as it is not of heavy construction and seems to be made for light duty around the house. +JMJ+"
1,Disappointing.,"This should have been a good stapler, given Swingline's reputation. However it broke in just one week of heavy use. I since bought aSwingline 747 Black Classic Desk Stapler (S7074701R)at an office surplus store, and it stood up to extremely heavy use (bordering on abuse) for a year and is still going strong.I don't know if I got a lemon, but I wish I had bought a 747 in the first place."
1,Not a fan,"This stapler did not work as advertised. We got the proper size staples and used it as per instructions. It did not fire the staples as it should. They would jam, break, and bend. Don't know what was wrong but we junked it and bought another one which works. Do not buy this item."
1,DON'T Buy,This is a terrible stapler. Jammed the whole time I had it. Only had it for a month and then it wasn't worth returning.
1,Always jamming,This stapler always gets jammed. I would NOT recommend purchasing this product since it is such a problem. We probably use it 20ish times a day and it jams 5 times a day.
5,"Good quality, great price","We rarely need to staple anything at home...but when we do, the cheapo $2 model never cut it. The only thing that would make it better is for them to include one strip of staples with the stapler. This would last me forever and I wouldn't have to purchase 5,000!"
1,Dirty upon opening box and jammed upon second staple.,The heavy weight filled me with anticipation but upon opening it I noticed it was dirty for a new stapler. I installed staples and used it and upon the second strike it jammes. I tried to open it and it would not open. I tried to see jammed staples and could not see anything yet it failed to work after that. I got ONE staple out of it.
1,Only lasted a month,"I bought this stapler as an inexpensive replacement for my middle school classroom. Unfortunately, the students were able to render it useless in a matter of weeks. Surely, with adults using it, I can imagine it would have held up much longer but that doesn't do someone with children being the primary users much good. I've opted for an electric model. I'm hoping ""no touch"" will be just the cure I need to stop going through a stapler every 5 weeks."
1,It jams all the time and requires a lot of force to use,This is my first Amazon review ever. I just got this stapler the other day from Amazon. It jams all the time and it's very difficult to unjam. I use Swingline standard staples so it's not the staples. Do not buy this one.
1,Broke down after 2 days,I bought the stapler only because it was nr 1 on the amazon most purchased list. Big mistake. It broke down after 2 days. Not worth the time to go to post office and return. HIGHLY not recommended
1,Short life stapler offers a long life of frustration,We bought a large supply of these staplers for our library believing they would work for the extremely high use our staplers get. They jam easily and do not work after a few weeks of customer abuse. What a waste of money.
3,Falls a little short,"I'm having problems with this stapler using the recommended staples when I have only a few sheets to staple together. Being a commercial stapler, I suppose it is not designed for light duty tasks. Based on my usage - mostly 2 or 3 sheets of paper at a time, I would choose a different stapler."
5,Excellent Stapler,"This stapler is the best on the market (in my opinion). It is made of hard metal and is very durable. I was able to staple a 11 page document without hardly any effort. There was no need to slam the stapler down on a table to make the staple penetrate through the last page. I have noticed that some reviewers have complained about staple jams but I have not experienced any staple jams with this stapler. Sometimes, staple jams are a result of improperly loaded/defective staples (staples that stick together). This stapler is great and inexpensive. Swingline makes good products and I recommend this stapler to anyone who needs a durable stapler - this stapler looks like it will last for years."
5,This is a commercial grade stapler.,"I have previously purchased an inexpensive stapler, it was also a Swingline. The inexpensive one would jam and would only stape a few sheets at a time. This stapler works great, all metal construction, and as it is pretty long it is easy to staple through a pretty large stack of paper without any problem."
4,A Great Read,"I read the ""The Vanishing"" when I was still in grade school. My teacher kept telling me to start branching out on other books besides romance and horror. I tried to go for sci-fi and came across ""The Vanishing"" in the library. I have to say that I did come to like this book very much. I wanted to get the rest of the series but I honestly cannot remember why I did not continue with the series. I am now in college and was looking back into my earlier reading and remembered reading ""The Vanishing."" I decided it was time to get the last two books. It was incredible. I could not put them down. The whole time you kept asking yourself, ""how would you react to that situation?"" A lot of the reviewers say they like the second book, ""The Convergence,"" better, but I am more partial to the last one, ""The Return."" The ending left you satisfied as well in my opinion. The whole series just made you think on how the world is today. I recommend this series to everyone, adults and young adults alike."
1,awful album,"I'm a huge entombed fan, so I bought this cd and lemme tell you, it's the worst thing they've ever recorded. Do not waste your money on this cd. Buy Serpent Saints instead. That cd is amazing."
1,mom of a 5 year old,This game is terrible. I have just purchased my computer and the game is so slow. A grown person can barely place the furniture much less my 5 year old. The introduction to the game and instructions are way to long for a childs attention span.
1,I should have read the reviews here first!,"I purchased the game for my 4 year old daughter and was extremely disappointed in the quality. I should have read the reviews first as they sum up the CD-ROM perfectly. Slow to load, confusing, a mumbling narrator and terrible graphics. This is the first and last Disney CD-ROM that I will purchase. The Vivendi Universal games that distribute all of the Barbie titles could definitely teach Disney a thing or two about designing age appropriate, amazing software for kids. Don't waste your money on this product."
1,Big Disappointment!,"We bought this cd for our 7-year-old daughter. The cd seems to slow down the speed of the drive so that it can't be installed at all. Nothing we try works, and our computer is only about a year old and surpasses all of the system requirements. We have never had this much trouble from a cd before. Overall, it has been a waste of money and time, not to mention a disappointment to a small girl who thought it looked fun. We expected more from a big money company like Disney to put out better quality products. This is our first Disney Interactive CD, and most definitely our last."
1,Waste of money,Won't install no matter what. My computer has the minimum requirements yet the game can't seem to find them. Waste of money. I don't know of anyone that has gotten this game to install. Don't buy this game! (But it is the only game we've gotten from Disney Interactive that hasn't worked.)
4,Needs 3D graphics card for best gameplay,"It never ceases to amaze me when novice pc users wonder why a 3D game is slow to load & the graphics look funny on their NON-3D PC!!!Don't rubbish the game because of your ignorance please. Get a 3D graphics card & then judge the program on it's content. The graphics are beautiful, there are 5 castles to choose from & you can decorate just about everything in them. There's also a storybook adventure game waiting for you when the designing is done! Excellent quality as I have come to expect from Disney."
5,Proven wrong!,"Needed a new battery for my Kodak digital camera. I was price shopping and decided to try this aftermarket brand for my camera. I've always been skeptical of non-manufacturer batteries. But I decided to take a chance since this battery was sold directly by Amazon. I'm not the least bit sorry for my decision. Works great, fit perfectly and holds the charge. What more could you want from a battery? I would try other batteries from this manufacturer when looking for a replacement battery for other devices,(as long as it's sold directly through Amazon), since this one is working flawlessly. Thanks again Amazon for a good product and great service."
1,Doesn't hold a charge,"I ordered this for my Kodak EasyShare camera and it doesn't hold a charge. I threw away all the packaging before I realized it doesn't work, otherwise I would have tried to return it."
3,Poor text,The story is good and about one of my favorite time periods and areas of interest. The problem is that the text of this download was awful and hard to read. The quality of the scan of this book is also very poor. More quality assurance should have gone into the production. Vol 1 of the series was a much better quality. I would hesitate to buy this book or any from Kindle if the quality remains poor.
3,4 stars - modern mid-east dub beats with some arabic rap,"a couple of quality tracks like the standout ""Aalash Kwawna"" - tripped out political hiphop with vocals in arabic and english - discontent and unrest in Marrakech with copious amounts of hash. the rest is still good, alternating between mid-tempo jungle and triphop with sampled flutes or ouds, though a bit forgettable... very promising direction."
1,fair,I got the wrong book. I picked the Massachusetts police scanner book but the one I got was from differnt state. I think it Human error on the the sellor part. when I confirmed every thing on my account it said you order Massachusetts book. I think over all it was mix up.
4,DPW,"The story is based on a manga. It has two disks, Japanese and English language tracks and subtitles. No extras."
4,"Great information, splendid inspiration","This was my two-year-old's favorite book; for some time he and it were inseparable. Bold, simple illustrations on bright backgrounds make a terrific fist visual introduction to the process dinosaur bones undergo for extraction, study, and display. Thanks to this book, mine was the only toddler in his peer group who could identify a paleontologist and explain what one des. Inspired by the story, to this day one of his favorite games is to ""dig"" for imaginary dinosaur bones in the sand, ""wrap"" them, pack them in ""crates,"" load them on the ""truck"" (his stroller), and transport them to the ""museum"" (our living room), where they are unloaded, assembled into ""skeletons,"" and carefully studied for the remainder of the day."
4,Compelling visuals for dino-loving kids,"Byron Barton's ""Bones, Bones..."" has the simple, inevitable story line that my son loves, plus the building up of the dinosaur image from the bones found in an archeological expedition. For any dinosaur kid who is at the developmental stage of building up from the pieces - seeing the bones uncovered, packed, transported and unpacked before assembly into a dino skeleton (T Rex, of course) is a daily delight.It is a simple story, though, so choose for younger readers."
4,My three year old is wearing out his copy,"This is one of a handful of books that we read over and over and over. My son LOVES this book. It is so simple and accessible for small children but explains exactly what a paleontologist does with only the words it needs. The simple, bold and bright illustrations are practically mesmerizing as well."
2,Works but not the best run time.....,I've purchased other aftermarket laptop batteries and haven't made complaints. This battery just didnt perform as well as other market brands that Ive used over the years.
4,Aquamarine Pendant was beautiful!!,"This pendant was beautiful! It wasn't as blue as I had hoped but the quality was more than amazing anyway. Also, thank you for your wonderful service as well."
4,Great receiver,Great system. Easy to use and install. I would like to have a little more power for when I need more volume.
3,Nice piece of equipment But..,Harman Kardon AVR 146 Home Theater Receiver with iPod Control and HDMI connectivityThis Is a very nice piece of equipment and is quite a handful to learn about. I had it for a month now and still don't have all the command and nuiances figured out. It has great sound and adaptibilty. Though I am not sure if I am getting all I can get from the system. I have contacted Harman Kardon ( they were very helpful)and other companies I have the unit controlling to try and get the most from the system Istill experimenting with contol options and set up menus but for all the tinkering I am still not sure if this is the end all. Once I learn more I can say that this is a really great buy . But for right now it just GOOD.
1,Too bad,I've had two of these. They sound great but only last about a year. Time to spend a little extra.
2,Questions to ask!,"Last night my AVR-146 did not stay on, gave a faint odor of smell, and a bit of a crackling sound; given the fact, that all components are solid state; repair would cost more then replacement; my questions folow Is the AVR-154 still made? If so is it stronger than the AVR-146?; If so, then the AVR-154 will be the replacement model; I believe the power is 50% stronger than the AVR-146; is this correct? I am disappointed that this receivr lasted for around 2 years with conservative use. Please respond via this site so I may make mt decision ASAP.Thank you in advance!"
5,HK AVR 146 Rockin great deal!,First of all this is a great receiver for the price. It has all the features you would ever need for a home theater application and then more. There are plenty of hookups for all of your accessories; however with my particular cable subscriber the HDMI terminal did not work from the cable box to the receiver.
2,Mixed Feelings on this one...,"I purchased this CD as it was similar in sound to another product on Amazon called ""Antique Music Box Christmas"" from KRB Music. Unfortunately, the recordings use a bit too much echo or reverb to the sound for my liking. And the melodies seems to be performed a bit too ""mechanically"", sounding as though they were generated by a computer as dictated by sheet music. The performances are somewhat lacking in enthusiasm. On the other hand, perhaps they are wise to market this for ""Baby's First Christmas"" as it will not fall on as critical an ear this way. It is still a somewhat enjoyable product, but for adults, it tends to be tedious to listen to. For more lively faire, I suggest the above mentioned ""Antique Music Box Christmas""."
4,"A mixed bag, but kinda nice!","An interesting collection of Celtic trad and fusion... It's mainly on the glossy side -- the disc opens with some of the more overproduced, world beat-ish examples of Capercaillie and Kila's ouvres, but gradually shifts into more acoustic terrain with some classic Planxty and Christy Moore, and a compelling ballad by Paul Brady (""The Island,"" one of the highlights of the disc). It also drifts into an unusual Galician vocal ensemble, Leilia, who transpose Celtic song into the sort of women's choral work that Balkan groups such as Kitka, et al. are known for... This disc is definitely a mixed bag, but definitely worth checking out if yo want to get a good sense of the range of this style of music."
5,"A ""must have"" in anyone's collection","I will keep this short and sweet. I loved this the moment I put in on to listen to it. This is something that I highly recommend to anyone, even if they are not really ""into"" Mozart like I am. Mozart literally soothes my soul, but this also makes my soul sing!Itzhak Pearlman and Daniel Barenboim are superb.Buy it and see if you don't become a believer!"
5,Food for thought,"Very interesting! I love this kind of information! I dont trust the government, and this video under scores my train of thought. I am pleased with my purchase, and am glad I watched it. Even happier I own it. This DVD is ""underground' thinking, and most ""sheeple"" dont want to know. I DO.Give me facts- let ME decide."
5,Compelling Evidence of a Hidden Agenda,"Prior to watching this DVD, I had previously only read superficial articles about this subject. This documentary provides unique insights on the amasing secret agenda behind the foundation of America and the influence of Freemasonry in the destiny of the most powerful nation on Earth.The DVD is quite long, but it can be watched by (well organised) chapters, which flow in a very consistent way.It just leaves you with a sad feeling that if you're not part of the masonic spheres of control, you're just a puppet, a slave of their system of power."
3,Very In-depth,"I found this volume 1 very long, yet interesting. It felt as though they went off the topic sometimes, and gave in-depth opinion and facts about certain people, but it was still interesting. I was a bit disappointed with the special effects and the acting. They use one acting scene too often."
5,Awesome,"This documentary will have you hooked from beginning to end, you must watch it at least twice to get all the information to sink in, there is so much fascinating info, you will probably want to watch it more than that. Excellent graphics, interviews and footage. Unashamedly tells the truth and in great detail. A must watch for any history buff or layman!!"
5,The truth you were never told...,"Wow! Get a notebook and pen handy and get the history lesson you never learned in school, or college! This is such an advanced and contemporary DVD, I feel I learned more in an hour than all my years in school. It's so in depth and has such detail, that it's hard not to believe the claims made in the DVD. There is so much evidence given, that it is absolutely convincing. Great!!"
2,Book construction problem,"I won't comment much on the story which is an interesting mix of great fantasy ideas and much inspiration, combined with a pessimistic view of humanity, in general. However, this specific version of the book from Quiet Vision Publishing, came to me with the binding completely dried out. Reading it for the second time, in the year since I got it, brand new, from Amazon, leaves me holding a bunch of loose pages -- almost all of the pages are broken out."
5,The Most Educational Book Ever!,This book is extremely educational in so many ways. This is part of the reason as to how I know thousands of different dog breeds that most smart people wouldn't. This book is fabulous!
5,A MUST Have,"If you are planning on working with varying breeds of dogs, this atlas is a must have for your library. I have one in my office and car. Extensive book chick full of wonderful information on most every breed of dog."
1,Oscar de Leon DVD quality,"Ugly sound, just the 3 or 4 first songs the rest is ugly, ugly, poor quality.Oscar De Leon - 30 Aniversario Del Leon De La Salsa"
4,Simon comes of age,"Like some others have already said here: I did not know what to expect when I started reading. Before I could really formulate any real opinion, it was as if I was being carried into Simon's world whether I liked it or not!So in spite of myself--I kept reading. And this wasn't an easy read to put down--at least, not for long. So I didn't mind. And before I knew it, I was taken further into a spiritual journey I simply was not expecting.Yes, Simon is an entertining narrator, to be sure, but where he goes is a surprise to him and the reader as well. There were passages here that really blew me away. And I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has not read this strange but delightful story. Read in its entirety, you won't be disappointed.My only problem is it needed some better proofreading, though! (some typos,etc.)"
1,Not for everyone. Fer sure.,"I was bored and impatient while reading this book. The characterization of this particular generation is done so much better in various films. ""Si"" was whiny, trite and annoying to this reader. I finished it only because it was reviewed so positively that I thought it might make a last minute turnaround and become meaningul, layered or impressive in a unique way. It didn't."
4,good book,"Another good book by Michael White. Moves rather slow at times, found Soul Catcher a better book by this author."
3,The woods are dark and deep,"I liked this novel although I don't give it great marks because I thought it was a little implausible and the working out of the plot was too mechanical. It didn't have the effortless flow of a great novel. But the atmosphere was excellent and the backwoods Maine characters (reminiscent of a kindler, gentler Deliverance) were well portrayed."
5,A remarkable novel,I am one of Michael White's students. I read his book as part of our English class. I enjoyed his book much more than I thought I was going to. I hope he writes more books like this.
5,Detrás del Silencio,"Cecilia es una rockera con voz y estilo privilegiados. Qué lástima que no podemos encontrar su ""Carretera"" en C.D. Sony ha perdido una gran artista."
3,"Cute, but no support... :-(","This suit is adorable, but if you have any chest at all, there is no support - a must for pregnant women! I had to return it."
2,Insipid,"I don't mind subtle, but I thought outside of peppery on the back of the throat, it seems quite tasteless. I imagine some like it this way, but i would like more green and olivevy."
4,Anyone Else Get a Burning Sensation?,"I just ordered this product from Amazon, and I very much like the taste. But as soon as I swallow the olive oil I - and others in my family - detect a burning sensation on the back of my throat. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this likely a production defect with my specific bottle, or is it a characteristic of the product itself? I have never had any other olive oil do this."
4,A nice mix of pop and alternative tracks from the 90s,"I have to admit, I'm an 80s music fan, and I didn't find much to like in the early 90s grunge scene. This compilation provides a nice overview of what I did like about the 90s, especially some of the more alternative songs and bands. For starters, there's my favorite 90s group, the Gin Blossoms, featured here with their biggest hit ""Hey Jealousy"" (I would have preferred the less-played, more soulful ""Found Out About You""). In other radio hits, you have Cracker's ""Low,"" a gritty tune I found surprisingly appealing. A bit more off-beat but still-familiar tunes include ""Dreams"" by The Cranberries and ""There She Goes"" by The La's. The remaining tracks, a mix of hits and songs I'd never heard of, varied from upbeat and dancey to more garish and grating. However, most people will find something they like here, and if you're looking for an eclectic 90s collection, this might just fit the bill."
2,Security Loop is practically useless,"I purchased this stapler because of the security cable loop that is practically useless because of its size and position.The angle and size of the too-small loop doesn't allow for the insertion of a security cable. I ended up having to feed a zip tie through the loop and attaching the zip tie to the security cable. Also, the stapler broke within a few weeks.The spring popped out and the accompanying directions don't describe where it belongs or how to reinstall."
4,"So far, so good!","Ok - I've used this video once and while the choreography is CRAZY with tons of changes, I really feel like it will only be a couple of workouts until I get this one down like the other Firm videos in my collection. In my opinion it is HARD to find a pretty straightforward cardio video that is not completely low-impact and doesn't tie in some strength training. I do strength train with the heavy-lifting Firm videos but I know my muscles need to rest and this will definitely be perfect for the days between my strength workouts. If you are new to complicated aerobics and especially if you're thinking about buying your first Firm video I would look elsewhere. Great for the vets, though! I also recommend Tighter Assets Cardio Blast with Tamilee Webb for a good, quick aerobic workout."
2,Hard to follow on some parts,"I tried this DVD, since it came with the Transfirmer and found it very hard to follow in some of the step parts. The instructor changes the moves so quick, that by the time I learned the move she was already in the middle of another one. This is definitely not for the beginners. I've been using Firm workout DVDs for over a month and had a very hard time following the step moves. Just a bit too complex. On the positive side, I really liked the slower steps, I felt that they were easy to follow and I did get a good workout."
1,too complicated,I have many firm tapes that are sculpting with weights. I was looking forward to try one of there cardios. I'm not cordinated enough to complete this workout after trying three times I mastered 70% the second time but find the jumpy moves to frustrating and unfoucsed on the step.
2,Repeats the Whole Time!!,This video is just the same moves over and over again. I actually got annoyed doing the video and fast forwarded through some of the repeating moves. This is one of my least favorite videos from the Firm series.
1,Worst Firm DVD I've Ever Done,"I have a lot of Firm videos and this is the worst DVD I have ever done. Stephanie Huckabee is the absolute worst at cueing you for the next move and the transitions are horrible. I have tried this DVD at least 5 times and it's so frustrating, I have decided to give it to goodwill. I do love the instructors Allie DelRio, Pam Meriwether, and Allison Davis. Allie and Pam's DVDs with the Transformer series is awesome. I also want to rave about Alison Davis's Boot Camp DVD. It is one of the best cardio/strength training DVDs I've ever done and doesn't get boring. I'm also in awe at how graceful Alison moves throughout the DVD during all the moves."
4,Solid workout.,"This is a good solid cardio workout. While yes, there is a change of moves constantly, the cuing is good. Once you've done this workout 2-3 times, you will catch on. The workout flows smoothly from one segment to another, and does make some good use of the incline. If you are an intermediate exerciser, this is a good one to use. I actually look forward to this workout, as it does push me (I would consider myself advanced), but is pleasant to do. I find the constant change in moves challenging, and what keeps it from being boring. I am a believer in The Firm Super Cardio, but it does get wearing after awhile, as you know what is coming."
1,Ehh.,"This DVD came with ""The TransFirmer"". I was really dissapointed with this one. It felt more like a dance video than anything else (and I hate dancing). They didn't use the step as much as I wanted, and there wasn't enough weight lifting. The moves were very complicated, I have never had trouble with a workout dvd before. I'd reccomend the other 2 DVD's that go with the trasfirmer, especially the one with the skinny blonde on the cover. There was a lot of weight lifting in that one if thats what you are looking for like me."
2,UGH!!!!!!,"I hate this video so much. I have tried to do it so many times and today I gave up and threw it in the garbage. It's not hard enough exercise at all and impossible to keep up with. She changes moves every 2 seconds. The camera doesn't stay on anyone in a shot where you can try to follow the moves. I can almost swear I've even seen the other ladies in the video trip up a couple of times. And, I just find myself tripping over my own feet and unable to keep up. I would take jogging or kickboxing over this any day. Too much effort with not enough reward. I want to burn calories, not learn how to be the ultimate step aerobicizer."
3,I love the Firm but,"if you have one of their cardio workouts, you have them all.This workout is ok,standard stuff,and I would just plain wait until its been around long enough to get cheaper if you have to have it.The instructor is good but how many different ways are there to do step aerobics?I could be a little prejudice as I never got any results from step aerobics except for sore knees...one of the Firms many signature cardio and sculpt dvd's would be a better buy-see my reviews!!!"
3,My Halloween Hulk outfit,"The CD was silly but fun to hear once, but the clothes were perfect for my halloween hulkster outfit!!!"
2,Robotics...Really?,Much of the book has little to actually do with building a robot. Or even interfacing a controller into a system. Much of the book takes you through using a LCD. Little is done with inputs from sensors or controlling motors. Although it is a good tool to learn C for the PIC. It's not the best for using with robotics.
3,programming robor controllers,"To my way of thinking, there was a lot of informatiom, and references to Data sheets, with little more actual information that a first year student in electronics should know. This is just ny opoinion, and may be wrong, but it was what it looked like it to me. You may get more out of it. This is not a total slam, as there is some good basic info here."
3,Verify with seller that you will be receiving a GENUINE product before purchasing,I purchased this product with the belief that I was ordering a genuine replacement part. What I received was an aftermarket part made in China. The seller apologized and promptly remedied the situation to my satisfaction. Be sure to verify before ordering since using an aftermarket part will void your warranty.Kind of hard to rate this item since so many factors come into play when using UV that affect its performance and effectiveness. The only reason I decided to use it was because my warranty already expired. If this was not the case I would of opted for an OEM replacement part and coughed up the extra cash.I will say that the product I received was functional and appeared brand new. If you don't care about genuine parts and looking to save some money...go for it. It's too early to tell if using this item will have any ill effects on the transformer.
4,It's better and cheaper than Axe,"I've tried a lot of body sprays/deodorants whatever and I can safely say that BOD is the best deal of them all. Sure, Tag and AXE feature more variety and sex appeal but let's be honest guys. When it comes down to it, all your really trying to do is smell good for the ladies. The truth being that it doesn't matter how much you invest in expensive big name products that are overadvertised. The real question is: Does it make you smell good?My can of BOD was $1... Yes, a buck, and I've been using it for over 2 months in excess. It's still over half full! Wow that's a lot. I will say though, that this stuff doesn't really stay with you as much as i'd hope. It takes a good 3 or 4 well placed sprays to get it to stick. But, with as much in one can as this, who needs to be liberal?!The fragrance is great. Just as good if not better than the competitors. I really like blue musk. It's really pleasing to smell but somehow really manly."
1,"Nauseating, Can I give it a negative rating?","BOD is by far the most nauseating smell ever, in only minutes after spraying it queasiness and possibly vomiting may occur. Also the smell never goes away it is similar to the B.O episode of Seinfeld, although body odor is definitely better smelling than anything BOD has in its line. I am sure spraying prisoners of war with BOD would be torture considered cruel and unusual punishment. People would be charged with war crimes after the spraying.Unlike the other reviewers I have actually smelled this stuff and that is my only regret.If you think BOD, Tag or Axe smell good then you are a moron and should never be allowed to reproduce."
1,too expensive for the crappy sound,"these speakers are not very good. first of all, they are not magnetically sheilded cuz i put them close to my monitor and it turned green. the cord is very short and there is no bass. the ad says it can handle mega bass, but it doesn't. i am very disappointed with this product from sony. i am a sony guy and this is one that they should of never put out. i returned it the very next day."
4,Realistic expectations = good little speaker,"Why do people buy this and expect bookshelf speaker sound? Why do you think they sell larger speakers to begin with? Anyway, this is a nice little speaker system for what it is. I use it for listening to Podcasts. The sound on my iPad often isn't loud enough to hear over doing the dishes, etc. and sometimes I want to listen to my Nano without earphones. This fits the bill perfectly. The high frequencies are a bit rolled off, but nothing that the EQ in your iPod/ player won't cure. I wouldn't really recommend this for music unless it's just low background stuff. I like the form factor, hideaway cable and battery requirements. A lot of these kinds of speakers require 3 'AA' or 'AAA's. Why 3? Makes using rechargeables difficult as many chargers charge in 'pairs' of batteries. This takes 2 'AAA's."
3,"cute and handy, but not much for sound",It's a good little extension for an iPod or a week laptop sound system. But at high volume it does what any cheep little speaker system does and distorts everything.Pro's: It's small and it's controlled by the volume on your devise....Con's: It's small and it's controlled by the volume on your devise....think about it.
3,A FOXFIRE CHRISTMAS:APPALACHIAN MEMORIES AND TRADITIONS,"GOOD BOOK, BUT DEFINITELY NOT WHAT YOU WANT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A ""FEEL GOOD"" CHRISTMAS BOOK. A FEW TOO MANY SAD STORIES FOR ME."
5,bonus episodes,"this dvd has 3 episodes plus 2 bonus episodes double duel part 1,2,3, and the bonus episodes are double duel part 4 and the rescue. on the first 4 parts double duel caiba and yugi team up against umbra and lumis. on the last episode yugi goes to save his friends but while they are on caiba`s helicopter yugi tells about his past. this dvd is 1 of my favorites."
5,"Schubert - Beautiful music, Great interpretation, Bargain Price!","It really doesn't get better than this - 7 cds of absolutely beautiful music played with passion, grace, and fire. While I enjoy all forms of classical music, sometimes the sound of a lone piano just sounds right.Others have opined that this is the best complete set of Schubert piano sonatas available. I cannot say that with a certainty because I don't own any others. What I can say with a certainty is that if you order this set, you will not be disappointed. The beauty of music is its ability to soothe, awaken, and transport the listener to a place other worldly - a place that is uniquely his/her own. This piano music does just that - it is the vehicle by which you enter another world. A world that is Schubert, Kempff, and yours. What a great place to go after a tough day at work!"
2,Serious technical flaws in CD set,"I wish I had taken the review by ""A Customer"" more seriously before ordering this 7-CD set of Shubert's Piano Sonatas performed by Wilhelm Kempff. Several of the CDs in the set I received have serious flaws both in sound quality and the technical recording itself. I have a good stereo system, not a boom box, and I bought the set from amazon.com not some Chinese knock-off. The pianist is fantastic; I am very disappointed in the technical production of this set. I am returning the set to amazon.com for a full refund."
2,"Good performance, terrible sound","Don't be mistaken, I am a big fan of Kemff myself. As usual, Kempff's performance is more than avarage. However, the recorded sound of these more than adequate performance is bad enough (way too resonant) to make these CDs repulsive! Shame on you DG."
4,DBG'z: Bang Bang Boogie,Track Listing:1. Bang Bang Boogie [LP Version - 4:34]2. Bang Bang Boogie [To The Heart Mix - 5:08]3. Bang Bang Boogie [Street Life Remix - 5:15]4. Bang Bang Boogie [To The Heart Mix Instrumental - 5:08]5. Bang Bang Boogie [Street Life Remix Instrumental - 5:08]
1,AGREED. THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE YOU THINK IT IS!!!!!!,"Very disappointed. I ordered on the basis of the description, comments and cast list (which they still haven't changed). What I received was a DRAG RACING thang! I feel this was false advertising. When the order was placed there was NO mention of drag racing. It was the movie I wanted (Pictured, Described, Commented on and Cast List). When I got the DRAG RACING thang....I immediately returned it. Beware buying anything here unless you get a verification FIRST!!!"
4,"An old favorite, short but sweet. (Or is that ""sweat""?)","I did this DVD again today for maybe the first time in a year. I haven't neglected it because I don't like it; it's just that there are so many other Firm Workouts and Fit Primes that I also love that I'd forgotten about it. And now today I remember why it used to be (and still is) a favorite.In only 35 minutes you work most every problem area of your body: arms, legs, buttocks and stomach. There's weight training, squats and lunges, all combined with step work, and when you're finished you feel like you've really accomplished something. (Well, I certainly do, but then I'm in my 60s. I don't, BTW, recommend this for Golden (Silver?) girls like me unless you're a regular exerciser.)One caveat: Because it is such a short exercise session the cool-down is rushed. You might need to do a bit more stretching than the video allots."
2,Okay methods..room to improve,"Do NOT recommend...This DVD is too short with not enough time for the true exercise portion. If you have the original ""step"" equipment, they do not work for this dvd, meaning you would need to purchase the step equipment to follow the dvd."
2,Hmmmm,The soundtrack doesn't match the video. It is slightly annoying but not unusable. I think it may be a pirated copy because of this quirk.
5,IMPRESCINDIBLE PARA EL LECTOR EN ESPAñOL...,"...que quiera iniciarse en la ciencia moderna. Por lo general este tipo de libros son escritos por norteamericanos o europeos y los hispanoparlantes debemos conformarnos con su traducción (a menudo desafortunada, pues el traductor es tan sólo tal y no un científico).No es el caso de este libro. El autor, Luis González de Alba, además de ser un erudito en estos temas es un escritor ameno, divertido y agudo, que lleva de la mano al lector, paso por paso y con todas las explicaciones de por medio, por los complejos y fascinantes vericuetos de la teoría de la relatividad, la mecánica quántica, las supercuerdas, la ""partícula Dios"" y tantas otras materias que desafortunadamente no han sido el fuerte de nuestros pueblos. Ya va siendo hora."
1,Trimtrac GPS Tracker Device,"This unit does NOT work well. The movement sensor is a hit or miss, (it might work and might not). If the unit will not turn on when there is movement, than the unit is useless. Since mine did not work well, I borrowed another one from a college to determine it's effectiveness. His had the same problem. I called Trimtrac support and was connected with someone in Europe. He was not helpful, so I asked if there was an American branch I could speak with. I was given a number in the US to call. The Problem was never solved. My college and I both are at a loss. Trimtrac blamed the problem on poor Cell Phone service in our area. Funny thing is both our cell phoneswork great here. I rate Trimtrac a 0.Covert GPS Tracker Device System *Trimtrak* Car GPS Tracking *Magnetic Bracke..."
1,Life Recovery Bible review,"I have ordered this Bible for several women who have addictions and they are finding answers in how to live free of their addictions. Recently, I purchased one of these Bibles to help me councel the women in a greater way. I am very pleased with all the Bible study notes. However, I should of sent my Bible back because many of the pages were separating from the binding. No other person has had this problem so it was probably just a one time mistake. I would give this Bible an excellent review."
1,Don't Bother,"This slim guidebook isn't worth even its meager cover price. The author covers Soderbergh's directorial efforts up through ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) using a series of subheadings such as Cast, Crew, Story, Subtext, and Verdict for each film. The book also includes a section on unrealized projects as well and an introduction and epilogue. Much of the information is available elsewhere, and the author's original comments show no special insight. Most disturbing, in synopsizing each film, the author gets the facts of the plot wrong on a couple of occasions. Soderbergh's work deserves better."
5,Climatic Infusion is brilliant ambient sonic wallpaper,"Climatic Infusion is brilliant ambient sonic wallpaper of an especiallycolorful kind. On each track, nature sounds and relaxing, swishingelectronic effects introduce waves of repeating musical motifs that arelike ripples in a mountain lagoon. - Eric Meese, KKUP San Jose,CA"
2,look further for you $$$,There's really only 1 setting on this ~ BURN! Don't need the other 4 of 5 tick marks as the 1st pretty much burns it to a crisp.
4,Interesting,"As always, Gregory's stories are generally interesting. However, an economy of words would often help at times so that the story line does not become overly tedious. Yet, I always come back for more as I like the gooddoctor and his cohort."
3,Bad image,"I was expected cement to arrive in a quart can, not a plastic bottle. Amazon's image is obsolete. Needs to be updated."
3,How could a man's love be so stupid?,"I must say this book is well written. It stirs up emotions long forgotten. You become attached to the characters, especially Joanna and Pace. The story proceeds well, but for a while it bothered me that Pace can be that thoughtless, and leave on several occasions. That Joanna had to be the one to develop their relationship all the time. She was the one to follow him everywhere he disappeared to... I would have given him up a long time ago. But still this book is a good read."
5,ABSOLUTELY GREAT,"This book is extraordinary. I was utterly absorbed.It offers love and death, sex and mystery, friendship and family, art, obsession, romance, growth, realizations. I loved it.The blurbs on the cover say how ""sexy"" and ""erotic"" the book is. That's true but I wouldn't have focused on those aspects, as there were so many other things that knocked me out. The characters, the sheer beauty of the language....The sexual encounters are so central to the events and motivations, so necessary and so seamlessly integrated, that the scenes simply came across to me as wholly human.Also, the legal parts are superb. (As a lawyer, I find many portrayals of trials ridiculously amusing or annoying. Sometimes it's all so hackneyed I can't enjoy the good parts of the book. But here, the novelist is dead on target.)This is the kind of book you hand to a friend and say, ""You've GOT to read this!"""
5,Wonderful!,"A flawlessly-crafted mystery, beautifully written: spare yet full. In Flesh Tones, M.J. Rose has created a dramatic, and all-too-real world. Emotionally gripping. Wonderful characters: memorable. A literary page-turner."
4,An insider's look at the art world,"One of the most engaging aspects of M.J. Rose's writing is that she gives the reader an ""insider's look"" into a possibly unfamiliar venue. ""Flesh tones"" is set in the art world, and both the process of painting and the business end were depicted in an interesting and convincing way. The characters were attractive and made you care about them."
1,"Overhyped, a disappointment","I think there's supposed to be some suspense in here, but who could find it? The relationships are phony, and without the suspense, what is left? - dull writing and little else."
3,creature collector's set,"For those who admire the Universal monster series,this set of films reviews one of the most popular horror characters in the 50's,following the three films that brought the creature from the black lagoon to life.If to please one most focus on the packaging vintage set for the 3-pack as well as it's content even though the first film stands clearly better than it's two sequels.Perhaps the fun of owening them all together is the considerable aspect of enjoying a dark night and a bowl of popcorn while watching 3 of the most memorable films of the old black and white days of cinema."
2,Not so great. Thanks.,"It's got really bad binding and it's usually incomprehensible. I am good at math, but I got really lost when I tried to use it to figure anything out...but nice try, Foerster!"
3,Needed for class,"Haven't read the book, it was required for a navigation class and I bought it and lent it to my class mate to read. No requirement, yet to use it."
4,Boat Navigation for the Rest of Us,"As titled, this book explains things in a way that the occasional boater can understand. The illustrations are effectively used."
2,The Pretender: The Liar's Club,"It was, at best, something to read as I fell asleep. I found it rather similar to something I would expect a good high school student to write. All the pieces were there, but it just didn't stack up."
4,Unrealistic but affecting,"Like her other Liar's Club books, this one has a very unrealistic spy setting that is rather distracting (although it does move the action along and keeps away boredom.) However, there is an emotional realism that has sometimes moved me to tears in the same books. By the way, I'd read some of the other books in the series first and felt like I was dropped in the middle of things. This is the first book of the series but it still feels like there must be something before this that explains the setup she has created."
3,Bit of a frustrating mess,Bradley's off to an interesting start with this series. There are several amusing encounters between the hero (Simon) and heroine (Agatha) throughout that show potential for the writers comedic abilities.But we also get a bogged down story with too much backstory inflicted on the reader for the rest of the series.I also found myself extremely frustrated with the disjointed political intrique and reasons for keeping these two apart. It's a hodge podge of unbelievable story that simply wouldn't fly in the time period.Yet the humor and ultimate ending has me intriqued enough to give the rest of the series a chance.
3,good for the genre,this book is what you expect for this genre. great beach reading. good for escapism!
5,A new writer for my favorites list,"The Pretender is my second Celeste Bradley book, and I am hooked. This one has it all: humor (I smiled through so many pages & even laughed out loud a few times), heartbreak, longing, romance, sensuality, suspense, adventure, tenderness, a well-paced plot, and engaging characters.The secondary characters turn up in other books, which is lovely (and these two reappear later) because they are wonderfully drawn (Button & Kurt, for example). Simon is truly dreamy and Agatha is indeed headstrong and quick-thinking. Unfortunately that sometimes gets her into trouble. My only complaint is that Simon didn't hang on to his fake accent long enough and he seemed, for a spymaster, rather slow on the uptake in figuring her out. But, get past that and the book soars. Splendid!"
4,Typical Gold Toe quality,I like it when a familiar brand remains consistent in bringing their products to market.The socks are good quality and priced fair.
2,Not as advertised,The item I ordered was at least 80 percent cotton but the one delivered is 76 percent cotton. I'm not going to hassle with a return but this is obnoxious.
4,Great socks for a great price!,"I have to admit, I was reluctant to make this purchase after reading other's reviews. I decided to go ahead and purchase them and I am very glad I did. These are thick, comfortable, and affordable. I could not find a better deal shopping around.It seems other buyers are upset that these are made in Mexico. That doesn't bother me at all because they are still great quality.I will buy more in the future."
5,Comfy socks,"Pros:-Very comfortable fit! My shoe size is 8.5 and I got the 10-13/Shoe:6-12.5 sized socks-Will last long thanks to the thick cotton layer-Elastic on the ankle is just right. Not too tight or loose. Won't slip downCons:-I don't like the yellow color, prefer all white but they wouldn't be called Gold Toe socks for a reason"
5,Gold Toe Socks Rock!,I have made several purchases of the Gold Toe quarter socks as they are a great quailty sock and come in an extended size that fit a man who wears size 13 shoes! I would recommend them to anyone.
2,Sized too small!,My husband has been wearing these socks for years and this is the first time that we've had a problem with them. These are the extended size socks but they are extremely small. When held up to older pairs of his extended size the size difference is extreme. I checked to see if we were sent regular size and we weren't so maybe Gold Toe labeled them wrong?
3,Thin and light,"If you're looking for thin and light socks, and sort'a smallish and tight on a foot that takes a 10 1/2 shoe size, then these are OK. But if you want something substantial, and a sock that doesn't feel like it might crawl down on your heel, then look elsewhere. If you're a size 11, or higher, this isn't for you."
1,"Too large, loose after first wash","This is a review for Gold Toe Men's Cotton Quarter Athletic Sock. I purchase these socks based on very good review here.1. Comfort: These socks are comfortable, soft at first, however after an hour i feel very warm.2. Material: These socks don't look like it was made from quality cotton.For $18, these socks are not worth the value.3. Size: I order size 10-13( for shoes size 6 to 12.5). The socks are too large and too loose(my shoes's size is 8). In addition, after the first wash, these stretch a lot. I have Nike , Puma, CK socks and have never had this problem. I think these socks are good for big and tall size ONLY. I don't recommend buying this if you wear shoes size smaller than 9.Hope my review help you to make better decision."
2,Is it me?,"Is it me or did I receive a bad batch of these? I bought these on the reviews that were written previous to mine. The socks that I purchased had holes in the toe area after I wore them only 3 times. This was not just one pair, it was all 6 pairs. Thumbs way down on these!!!"
1,Large is NOT Large,"I ordered a set of Large. Well, large is for shoe sizes 6-12, which means they fit a size 6-8, NOT a size 12.That is not large, that is the standard size for socks, which is too small for someone with a size 12 foot.Please be aware of this. I am not a happy camper."
1,Made In Mexico,"I also have been buying Gold Toe for years until today. I was at J C Penney and saw that the package said, Made In Mexico, in small print. I will no longer be buying their brand. The United States is no longer The United States but just another country. Nothing is Made In America anymore. Sad, very sad."
3,Gold toe,"It has 58% cotton, seems small to my 10 inch foot.Fitting is ok, but sometime it moves aroundI would prefer it the little longer"
4,Thinner than expected,"But they'll work. Not as thick as the ones I got at gold toe in Colorado, but they work for me"
2,A Sad decline,"I have been a user of various types of 'Gold Toe' for well over a decade. I cannot comment on their dress socks but the decline in the quality of this particular item in the last year has been appalling.I will not refer anyone to another brand, I would just avoid this item."
2,Nothing like the picture,"This sock is all bottom and no top. In other words the picture shows a nice upper ribbed quarter, whereas in actuality there is not much of an upper quarter at all. I sent them back."
1,AVOID! Fabric used is NOT what's listed in online description.,"These socks are the worst. Apart from construction issues, the fabric that's used is significantly different to what's listed in the online production description.The online description lists: 84% combed cotton, 14% stretch nylon, and 2% spandex.The actual sock label lists: 79% cotton, 19% nylon, 1% polyester, and 1% spandex.And quite frankly, I have enough floor experience in garment production to doubt very much that the sock label is correct. It wouldn't be the first time a manufacturer conveniently ""forgot"" to make sure a label was updated to reflect downgrades in fabric quality.So sad to see a classic brand go down the tubes."
2,SIZING NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE,"I bought these socks to fit my size 12s. I expected them to be roomy. They were a close fit out of the package. They are not as ""tall"" as the photo led me to believe. Mine barely reach my ankle. After ONE washing, they barely fit my size 12 EEEE foot. Good luck if you have truly big feet with this product.""Extended Size"" my foot!"
2,Very nice but just not durable,"Take it from me, I have been wearing socks for almost all my life... . When I first saw these, I bought them immediately. I only have a size 11 foot, but the so-called correct size of sock is always too tight, and I don't need a circulation problem. So this looked perfect.They are a nice sock. Good seams, good fit, big enough, but they just don't last. In 6 months, I have already thrown away five for having holes develop rapidly with them.Gold Toe can do better. If this supersize catches on with other manufacturers, I will be trying those on, so to speak. Still, if you have big feet, this is the way to go."
4,"Good, but...","The socks are nice, but you can get better value at that red and white circley place as they carry a line made by gold toe at a better deal."
2,"Cheap, Low Quality Fabric","My socks have been washed many times since they arrived, and each time my dryer screen is heavily covered in lint from these socks. At this rate, they'll disappear several months from now. Spend your money on something that won't be scrapped off the dryer screen and into the trash."
4,"Farm animals rebel, causing problems for a hapless farmer!","When the rooster decides not to crow one morning, a hapless farmer is at a loss. Word spreads quickly among the farm animals and one by one, they each refuse to perform their assigned functions. How will the farmer make his living with such an ornery bunch? Read to find out!Cute book, amusing illustrations and fun sing-song story. You'll be surprised to find yourself speaking with a farmers drawl as you read this book aloud!"
5,Great for adults and kids,"My son who is disabled loves to sing to this c.d., we all sing along in the car. A great cd for both adults and children. Live life and enjoy with your kids. Dana"
2,Same,This score was not bad but if you already have the Shrek (the first one)soundtrack in your library there's no use in buying this one at all. They sound almost identical except for mabye a few.
2,No installation information,The product appears to be well-built but it is not a direct replacement; there is an extra wire on this compared to my original but no explanation of what it's for. Installing the new coil was not successful but who knows if that is because of a bad coil or if the extra wire should be used!!
5,Magneto Coil Review,The Part was just what was advertised and just what I needed to solve the problem. The mower runs great now! :)
5,Works great when installed correctly,My husband purchased this to repair our lawn tractor. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time. The only complaint that I have was that it did not come with directions and it will only work when installed in one direction. He did not figure this out until he put everything back together before he tried to start the engine. It is advisable that you test it first before putting everything together since he thought it was a malfunctioning part at first and almost returned it.
5,Success,This is one of my all time favorites and as anyone who loves perfume knows it's a 50/50 chance when ordering on line. This product is the real deal and at an excellent price. I will be back for more!
2,Better as a plug-in air freshner,"Reminds me of a room fragrance plug-in, like the Kitchen or Caramel or Sugar Cookie scents from Bath & Body Work or Yankee Candle, but more layered & sophisticated. I would love this as a home fragrance spray, especially in late Fall and through to the holidays. But for me personally, I can't stand it as a perfume.That said, I love two other Hanae Mori scents - Couture and Mystical Moon."
4,Good Mild Fragrance,"This is a nice mild fragrance. Nice for winter, as it smells like a musk, vanilla combination, somewhat reminds me of bbw vanilla fragrance."
2,HANI MORI,I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BUT IT DOES NOT SMELL THE SAME AS WHAT A PURCHASED AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE.
5,One of my favorites,"I'm a perfume junky, I love trying new scents, but I always revert back to my old favorites and Hanae Mori Blue Butterfly is one of my all time favorite perfumes. It's bold, but light at the same time. It gives off a faint vanilla smell; it's sexy, sensual and perfect for every day wear. I always get TONS of compliments when I wear it."
5,Smells Great & Arrived Fast,"I have no complaints. I am 27 years old and discovered this perfume years ago. It is my sent. When I first spay this perfume I actually do not love the initial smell, but when it settles into the skin, it smells fantastic without having that ""perfumey"" sent. I always get compliments on how good I smell when I wear this.Plus this product shipped very quickly."
5,Excellent choice,"I fell in love the first day I smelled this on one of my co-workers. My friends that smell the fragrance on me always ask ""what fragrance are wearing"". It is an attention getter . . . not because it's strong but because it's an inviting fragrance."
5,mit Originalinstrumenten!,"A great set for anyone interested in the Sturm und Drang era, or for anyone on the fence between modern versus original instruments. This set made me a firm believer in original instruments, contrary to the stories I've heard of people saying original instrument groups use originals as a cheap trick to sell their tracks.The quality of the CDs is also great and the 44th Trauer Symphonie is excellently played- one of the best renditions I've heard of it."
3,"Pinnock - pretty good Haydn, but not the best","As I type this review, I am listening to the recording of Symphony #52 from this set.Earlier today, I listened to these recordings of Symphonies 51 and 43 as well. I have owned many of these recordings since they first came out. In fact, this is the first recording of 43 I had ever heard, but the symphony never grabbed me until I heard a different recording (conducted by Aadland on Imp classics, hard to find). Pinnock races through it and misses a lot of the character and the sense of inevitability that this symphony has to offer. The recording of 51 is better with Derek Solomons, more character in the horn solo slow movement (though I have some reservations about that set as well!).Overall, it seems that Pinnock just doesn't dig deeply enough into these wonderful symphonies. Yes, they are fast and lively. But there's not enough articulation, oomph, depth to make this the set to own."
3,Andis Hangup 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer,This hair dryer is convenient because it is within reach anytime in the bathroom. The only drawback is that it is very noisy. I also have a Conair 1600w travel hair dryer about the same size and it is much quieter. I would not recommend this product.
4,wall anchors,"the hair dryer itself is very good & just what i wanted, however,the wall anchors that the dryer is secured to the wall with are useless. Dont know why a company disregards how important these small things are? another trip to Lowe's!!"
2,THEY TEND TO BURN OUT RATHER FAST,"aT FIRST THEY WERE VERY GOOD BUT NOW THEY DON'T LAST VERY LONG BEFORE THEY BURN OUT. REPLACEMENTS ARE SENT BUT THE SAME THING HAPPENS, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT THIS POINT."
3,Andis Hangup 1600 W,I've been using these powerful little dryers about 15 years because they fit nicely on the side of my vanity under an extended countertop. The only problem is that they only last about 1 1/2 to 2 years with 2 people using them daily - but the price is right.
1,Poor Quality,"I originally purchased the Andis hair as a ""direct"" connect model so it could be hung on the wall in my bathroom. What arrived was the standard unit with a GPIE fault AC plug. No problem, I can cut that off.In the meanwhile, my wife used the haridryer twice prior to my hanging it on the wall and it quit working altogether. So far, not impressed!"
1,Nightlight Feature not ready for Prime Time,"I was dismayed when my Andis Hang-Up died because I had screwed it to the wall and I didn't want to fill screw holes, so I was delighted to find it still available on Amazon. The new unit came with a novel night-light feature, which failed immediately, leaving an unpleasant smell of burnt plastic and an oily black soot deposit on the handle. The hair dryer still ran, but it filled my hair with the smell of an electrical fire. I sent it back to Amazon who promptly replaced it. The night light on the second unit again immediately failed, although without the odor of the other one. I'm still using it and I really like the hair dryer, but it appears to me that the night light is just not ready for prime time and may actually constitute a fire hazard."
5,Powerful,This is a great hairdryer. Don't let the size fool you. Is much better than larger dryers. Also is great to hang in bathroom. I went back and bought more for each bathroom. Shipped fast.
2,mixed feelings,Night light quit working after a week. The dryer itself works fine snd is handy being located on a wall and not in a drawer.
1,Review,"At first this hairdryer was great. Then the slow setting quit working and nothing I have tried has reactivated the show speed. The high speed is working find, but I really prefer the slower speel."
2,Would not buy again,"We bought this hair dryer in Oct. of 2009 and it stopped working in May of 2011, up to that point it had worked OK. It is small and loud and did not dry as well as a ""normal"" size hair dryer. We would not buy this product again."
1,Sent wrong product - picture is incorrect,I ordered the product pictured (Andis 1600W wall mount hair dryer) to replace a similar unit that I have been very happy with. I was sent a different product that does not match the pictured product and has multiple cords protruding from the base and is unusable to me. Amazon's rules are that it has to be returned unopened and I ripped the packaging before I realized the wrong product was sent. I will not be ordering from Amazon again.
5,Love the Convenience,This is my second of the same model. Previous one was used every day for over 5 years - exceptional value for money.
1,Didn't last,I was very happy with the power and the night light feature is nice also but it only lasted one year. I've had dryers that lasted many years and I would not purchase this brand again. I have very fine hair so it was never used for long periods of time and didn't have to work hard to dry my hair.I expect a hair dryer to last more than a year and this one didn't.
3,good stuff,"Can't agree with the previous reviewer.Although there aren't a lot of outstanding tracks on this cd,there are enough good little boppers to make it worthwhile.If you can get it for a reasonable price,buy it,you will enjoy it."
5,Good Read for Sybase Tools User,I give the authors of this book a thumbs up for giving the Sybase Tools programmer a useful book for understanding the EAServer environment. It is easy to read and follow. An intermediate PowerBuilder / Java developer will find it helpful. I really like the section on using PowerDynamo with EAServer. I would guess that Michael Barlotta only carries over about 25% of the material he covered in his first Jaguar book. The Sybase community needs more books like this one.
5,johnny rodriguez,This CD is great! I only wish they will make more with his many other hits. It is so nice to listen to while driving. Thanks
5,The Best of Johnny Rodriguez--Millennium Collection,These are the songs that made Johnny R. a sensation in the 70's and some of his biggest hits. It's a great CD that you will listen to time and time again...Johnny at his best.
2,loved it then the handle broke,"I have to admit I just learned to use a round brush and this one was great! Maybe I pulled it through my hair too roughly but my hair survived, the brush didn't :-( The handle snapped off within a few months of owning it."
5,Totally Wild Humor,Incredible... These stories are amazing -- and totally hysterical. You won't believe what you're reading -- and you'll laugh your head off. You would be amazed at what some people will do for a good time. Truly killingly funny.
1,Don't waste your time.,Very disappointed. Thought that this would have more funny stories. Seemed to be a collection of topics that I've heard before. It's really not worth the time to read it.
3,Funny,"This is a very funny book,Yet I find alot of the stories hard tobelieve.It's a great book for cuddling up with your spouse and having a good chuckle."
3,Funny stories but mostly urban legends.,"The stories are pretty amusing and make for good party conversation. The only problem is that half the stories aren't true. They're urban legends. Gerbiling, condom inspectors, etc. told as true but all exposed as hoaxes in the mainstream media. The stories that are true contain ""extra details"" not included in the original reports and clearly invented by the authors for effect. If you read it as a joke book, you'll enjoy it greatly, but if you're looking for TRUE stories, look elsewhere. Check out Jan Brunvand's urban legend books at Amazon for detailed studies on some of the urban legends."
2,"difficult to wear, need to remove the lace","bought this shoes which is just the right size for my boy. Even if it has enough allowance/space for his toes, its difficult to wear them. I was only trying it on him, and yet i have to remove the entire shoe lace. Very troublesome. Thus, i have to return it. I love stride rite specially their looks and the different sizes/stages to comfortably fit those precious feet, but this model didnt work for my boy."
4,Love the Mix,I love the how the vocalist's deep voice blends with the beat of La Union's music. The great and unique thing about la Union is the different rhythms that are incorporated into each track. I especially love the vocalist's interpretation and the sound effects that add so much to each song. A very good buy. If you are an Heroes del Silencio fan you will love La Union. And even if you are not anyone can appreciate this kind of music.
5,Daniel Amos Shotgun Angel,"What can I say about Shotgun Angel? It is a classic in Christian rock. This album was my introduction to a great Christian rock band who blazed the way for a lot of the alternative Christian bands even today. Terry Scott Taylor is a lyrical genious and it shows on this album. If you're into the country rock of the 70s by bands like Flying Burrito Brothers, NRPS, The Eagles, CSN, then you should dig this album."
2,Cute Idea but...,"I loved the idea of this bath toy, but it doesn't work very well. It's easier for my child to put the shapes in through the top latch so he doesn't attempt to put them in the sides. Also, since the boat has holes in the sides, it will not float for very long as the water fills up in it. The little squirter animal is the only good thing about this toy. It's cute and small for little hands. As far as durability, it is very tough. It has been thrown many times and has held up perfectly."
3,"Cute boat, but our girls got bored quickly",We got this boat a year ago... we played with it in the bath but after about a month they were no longer interested. It also didnt float but to be fair I dont think it was made to float!
5,Fun Bath Toy,Grandpa got this toy for my 2-year-old. It is very cute. The floatable boat is a lot of fun in the tub. The size of the shapes and the squirt animal are very easy for toddlers to handke. My boy also likes to use the shapes scooping water and pour the water onto his tummy. Lots of laugh and giggles. The toy is easy to clean.
3,"CUTE, BUT NOT TOO EXCITING!","I bought this for my 17 month old for Christmas. He loves squirt toys in the tub and shape sorters out of it. He used the squirter for a minute or two. When I tried to show him how the shape sorter worked, he showed me how he could drink the bath water out of the shapes instead!"
5,Tales from Life,"Good yarns, not just about biking, but about life. Analogous to PBS This American Life, Tales from the Bike Shop is biking centric and just plain enjoyable. You don't even have to ride a bike to enjoy these stories."
5,"If you enjoy the blues, this one's for you","For anyone who has ever said they didn't like the blues, this band will change your mind. When I first heard this guy play the guitar, he immediately went to my Hall of fame blues guitarist list. As a guitarist myself and one who truly appreciates good blues, I recommend you pick up any cd you can find of the Vargas Blues Band and add it to your archives. This band plays with so much feeling and emotion you are in for a treat. If you play guitar, you know what I mean so just sit back and enjoy."
4,Broke the first time I used it.,The first time I used it the spring came out. Put it back together and worked fine. Heavy and a little hard to get use to becuase of the bottom further back than the top of it. Works very well can staple several papers together at once.
4,Like the transfirmer!,I love the transfirmer itself and actually use it as a step in other videos or as a weight bench. I only liked 2 of the workouts. I did not like the one with Stephanie at all though. I would recommend this set though. Just wish they would have made more workouts using the tranfirmer..but still at least like I said in the beginning I can use it with other non-FIRM workouts.
4,Awesome FULL BODY workout,"Wow - I just bought this and finished the 1st video - and, granted I did the advanced moves with weights, this was a lot more intense than I thought it was going to be! I'm not in the best shape, but I'm not completely out of shape either and I was struggling towards the end. They have beginner modifications if you can't do the intermediate/advanced moves. If you are looking for an intense workout you'll need to buy dumb bells to go along with the video. I think this will be a great workout routine for me and can be for just about anyone, no matter your fitness level - but be warned, it IS challenging - push yourself and you'll get results! :)(NOTE: I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't done the other two videos it came with yet, but I bet they are just as good as the first one)."
3,Slow down,"I enjoy the videos that come with the Transfirmer and you do get a great workout. The videos themselves are ran similar to doing circuits between, cardio, weights, and stair stepping. The downside to this product is the transitions between the sets and moves. The instructors should have provided more time between changing the equipment and broke down the individual moves prior to starting them full speed into the workout. I have been working out pretty regularly for a year now and would not recommend this to anyone who may have knee problems or is just starting to work out. However, if you exercise between 3 - 5 days a week and are looking for a great workout I would highly recommend this product."
4,The Firm: Transfirmer,"I liked the ""fanny lifter"", I liked the concept of the incline box, but the new ""Transfirmer"" gives me the best of what The Firm has to offer. It's very sturdy and I anticipate having it around for a very long time. I have not yet tried all three workouts, but the Supercharged Sculpting Workout was certainly what I expected. The Transfirmer also works great with all of the DVDs I've purchased since the ""fanny lifter"" series. As a result, I'm going to keep all of my DVDs, but will be getting rid of the ""fanny lifter"" and I will be throwing away the incline box since it broke shortly after I purchased it. By the way, always order from Amazon.com when possible--the price is better, the service is superior, and product is the same wherever you go.The Firm TransFIRMer"
1,Cracked after using it for two weeks.,After using the TransFirmer steps for around 2 weeks and I have discovered lines of cracks on the top and bottom of the green box already. I'm not heavy and used this by following the DVDs with 2x5lbs dumbbells. I still cannot believe that Firm has come out a such poor quality product. I've called Firm and they said they cannot replace it unless I bought it from their site.Also there was absolutely no packaging when shipped. It was shipped in its original thin cardboard box without even a strip of tape on the opening of the box.Poor quality and service. I will not buy anything from The Firm again.Added on 12/04/2009I have contacted Amazon Customer Service about the product. They promptly agreed to take it back for a refund and paid for the return shipping. Amazing service!
4,A great workout,"Three DVDs, each with a different workout - 35 minutes, 45 minutes, and 55 minutes. As some have said there are parts of one DVD that are really difficult to follow but each time I do it I get better.Bottom line these are terrific workouts and well worth the money."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I'm no beginner to exercise or step aerobics and work out at least 5 days a week.. imagine my horror when I slipped the Calorie Burning dvd portion of this pricey, bulky exercise equipment into my dvd player excepting a great workout. Are you kidding me... the instructor was like Tony Little after 5 double espressos, moving from one complicated set of moves to another with absolutely NO time to familiarize yourself with the steps. About 30 minutes into this completely frustrating exercise frenzy, I turned it off and now I'm too discouraged and disgusted to even try the other two c.d.s that came with the system. So much for feeling good about myself or breaking an exercise plateau. All I did was waste money and become horribly frustrated and angry. Don't buy this unless you're an already experienced dancer or fitness instructor."
4,Beware of the footwork,"I have been using the Transfirmer series for three weeks now and have to say that while it has the potential to be a great product for me, I have wasted my money. I have been exercising regularly with personal trainers for four years and have excellent fitness, so I am not new to rigorous exercise. I thought I could save my money and use these DVDs at home instead. While the weight portions of the videos are great, the step and aerobic portions are difficult to follow. What would make it easier to follow is if the instructors did more repetitions of the same move rather than constantly adding steps and switching back and forth between moves. There is nothing in the DVDs to help you slowly and clearly learn the steps prior to beginning the work out. Also, the camera angles do not do anything to help a beginner learn the moves. They claim the steps are easy to follow, yeah right."
3,Not for beginners,"First and foremost, I am a out of shape twenty eight year old woman. I had used the fanny lifter in the past with huge success. I went from a size 14 to a size 4 with it. So I can say that I believe in the firm workout routine. When I decided to ""Get in shape"" again, I decided to upgrade and bought the transfirmer.What a huge mistake. The instructors go from one move to another without breaking a sweat. I was out of breath and sweating like a wild pig. Each routine was way to long for a out of shape loser like me. After a week, I gave up on the transfirmer.I went back to amazon and bought the Fanny Lifter and the three in one DVD. Its more my pace. Its made by the firm too. I see the results and wont give up this time. I'm hoping to work up to trying the Transfirmer again. For now, it is sitting in my closet collection dust."
5,EXCELLENT,"I was searching for a stepper to increase the intensity of my workouts, and for the price this was the best deal as it comes with 3 dvds. The innovative design does make for an excellent workout. The higher up you work the better it is! I use the stepper for the Firm series as well as other training. The only thing to be careful of is to make sure the two piece are locked in, especially when working on the incline, as a slip CAN and WILL happen if you aren't careful."
3,Way better than Universe X 1,"Universe X Part 1 was a mess. I didn't like it because had several lots of charatcers and seems to be not many of them were relevant for the story.With Universe X Part 2 is different. Most of the introduction of some characters from book 1 paid off for this second half making the reading far undestandable than the previous book, so it was easier to read. I enjouy some parts of it, but I don't think I enjoy much the end. It didn't end up with a bang or with something cool like Earth X (Alex Ross pencils Reed Richards).It was better then Book 1 but not great. I have Paradise X waiting for me so let see how it goes.By the way, the Universe X Omnibus (the last chapter) is a pretty good companion you can check before start reading the book. It is a little background for each character with Alex Ross sketches. Pretty good."
3,turn lights,"these fit in the inner side of the turn lights, but do not fit corners lights. better check on that. nice quality"
1,Does Not Fit Lexus GX470,"no problem with bulb per se, but it does *not* fit the 2007 Lexus GX470And I'm too lazy to return it. Yup.One star because the configuratior says it fits"
4,Good Clock--Would Be Better if Ceiling Projection Could Be More Flexible,"This clock set up well and is easier to program than our previous projection clock. Also, it appears to be more sensitive to reading the signals for updating, taking only a couple of minutes to attain the correct time and date when we first plugged it in. The ceiling projection is crisp and clear, but we do have a suggestion for improvement. In order to read the projection from our bed, we have to place the clock in a position that makes it impossible to read the clock itself when we're in bed. If the projection could rotate, it would be helpful."
3,"It's OK, but display is small on cieling - not good for what I wanted it for",I'm pretty blind without glasses on- so i have alawys liked having a clock projected on the cieling at night so i can easily see the time if I wake up in the dark. My old one broke so I got this one based off of price and some good reviews. It's OK for what it is- but i'm sad that the display is pretty small on the cieling- so i have to squint to see it at night without glasses on.... and you can't adjust it -so the base of the clock will likely be turned funny to have the display at night where you want it.
3,Sharp Projection with some issues.,I like this OREGON SCIENTIFIC RM313PNA Self-Setting Projection Clock because it's ability to synchronize with the Atomic clock and excellent projection sharpness. That said project ion is very odd and shows only at one angle which creates a question where to position the clock to project on a wall. It's not flexible so pretty much you have to bend it down or set something under it to correctly project. Front panel is not large and for me it's pretty much useless.
4,Basic Concepts in Embryology: A Student's Survival Guide,"This book is extremely helpful as a supplement to textbook readings. It definitely meets the objective of placing the primary concepts UP FRONT! Using this book, I was better able to focus my study, prepare for exams, and drastically improve my grade. I feel this book works best as a supplement, due to very recent advances in embryological study that are not included in this book."
5,Clear excellent overview of embryology,"If you are looking for a clearly presented explanation of the concepts of embryology this book is an excellent choice. While embryology is a complex subject, many of the standard texts and treatises unnecessarily obscure the topic by using verbose and obtuse prose. The author uses direct and relatively straightforward text that makes it much easier to learn about this fascinating subject."
3,Good for class Not for Boards,"This book offers a very detailed explanation of embryology in an easy to read format. It breaks embryo out of the 1960s format that our medical school taught in, but it is too much information for the boards. Embryo is good for cardio and GI and this book would be a good reference but don't use it for boards. You would be better off with High Yield."
3,"Some good information, but poorly organized","Lopez includes a lot of valuable information in this work. Probably more information than a beginner needs or wants. Also, I found the organization to be confusing. A much better book in this category, I felt, was Karen Armstrong's ""Buddha"". I also recommend ""The Buddhist Handbook"" by Snelling, although it is more idiosyncratic than the others."
4,Do it yourself hair art,"As a mom of a 10 year old girl, I appreciated the clear instructions and ideas in this book. Any child who has mastered the ""beadie buddies"" with pony beads can decorate bobby pins with the dazzling beads in this book/kit. Besides building self esteem and a sense of accomplishment, these creations can take the place of hair ornaments that can become costly. The patterns in the book could be adapted to other sizes of beads for camp necklaces, too. This is one to have fun with together."
5,Great gift,This great DIY book is a great gift for girls of all ages. I have done some of the crafts in the book and love Klutz books generally. This vendor shipped promptly and in great condition.
3,Warcraft continues,This is not your typical book. Because it is TokyoPop it is (forgive me) more like a comic book. As such I read it in about 20 minutes. It was entertaining though.
1,dragon hunt(warcraft),"i never got to read this bookbecause every time i tried to buy it, it was refunded.so i am not very happy about that,the last 3 books i tried to buy was refunded to me."
2,Nice pictures - generic story,"The art is quite good, but the story and characters are generic pulp fantasy, the same as you would find in any fantasty franchise from dragonlance to forgotton realms and not very appealing."
4,You can't skip to the end.,"Written by the author of ""A Very Long Engagement"" yet resembling it only by the superb story telling, this book elicited gasps of ""You're kidding."" ""I don't believe it!"" ""How COULD she?"" ""Oh no, oh no, oh no-what a horrible mistake."" ""I can't believe it."" from nearly each chapter. Beauty is dangerous."
5,"One Deadly Summer, one beautiful book","Sebastien Japrisot is a master of prose, characterization, and plotting. This is a simple story perhaps, but a tragedy--with fatal flaws, and mistaken identities, and all of the classic trappings of the genre. It is a tale well told, in several voices which weave intricacies of perception and plot, keeping the reader suspended until the last page. And it is a mystery: not only a 'whodunit' but a 'whatdidtheydo'...only the motive is clear. It is a motive of the deepest and blackest side of love and lust, madness and revenge. I haven't read Japrisot's other works but I am going to order them right now from Amazon.com!"
2,Doesn't live up to status of other titles.,"When I bought this title, I was using a copy of the ""Basic"" Spanish course that I had borrowed from the piblic library. That other course is very conversational - teaching you how to speak by letting you listen to real conversations. The ""Basic"" course is setup so that you can learn while you drive or jog or whatever - you really don't NEED the book. I was progressing very well, so I decided to buy my own. Well, ""Spanish Today"" was billed as an improvement, so I bought this one instead, but I think they should go back to ""Basic."" ""Spanish Today"" is much more like being in class, the examples don't give you adequate context or time to repeat, and you really do need to use the books. I would recommend that you use the ""Basic"" course instead."
2,It quit working,"I bought this driver for a project and it worked great. Then I put it in the garage and when I pulled it out a year later it would not recharge. New batteries and chargers cost the same as the driver, so I think it was pretty expensive for one small project.I would not buy this brand again."
4,Skill Drill/Driver,Ample power for the average homeowner. Not the choice for professionals but the manufacturer states that. Good quality at a fair price.
4,Great drill for do it your selfers.,"This is a great drill for light to medium jobs. The battery life is good, get about 2 to 3 hours of steady use. Good control and touch. Not too heavy and very comfortable to handle. Would not recomend this drill for heavy or commercial use, but its stated by the manufacturer. Wish it had a bit more torque and two speed settings, but i guess that might take away from the great touch that this drill has."
5,"Easy read, scientific, good preventative measures for cancer prevention. A friend referred it after using it to CURE her cancer.","Everyone should read this book as it has wonderful insight to making a few practical changes to their everyday living. There are also a few laborious changes for those who actually have cancer. My friend who had cancer actually flew down to Florida to see him and he guided her through the process of getting rid of her cancer. After receiving some radiation, she was thrilled at this approach even though she said it was a lot of work. There are other illnesses that this book is useful for preventing."
5,Very good tool,I've used this drill for a variety of tasks and i really like it. The tool is responsive and the light is handier than I would have thought.
4,"5.0 Amp Keyless Chuck Drill Skil6265-04=3/8"" Chuck","Not a bad drill! Plenty of torque and power for light and medium jobs at home or on the job! Keyless chuck is good and the work light is a handy feature in dark areas or spaces. The handle fits well and comfortably in the hand and this unit has a good heft. This is a rugged unit and could maybe use a little more finess on start up for finer jobs, but will do quite well for general purpose jobs. Overall a good product and should provide years of reliable use."
4,A Spiritual reminder....,"A game that I first met in the early nineties....interesting then and, again. I searched and, found the game at about the same price as the first....inflation proof? Of course, is personal growth to be purchased? This game touches on personal desire to be more of the real what/who one is.I find the 'serendipitous' flow of the game to be a subtle acknowledgement of personal energies that all beings share. Metaphysical parts of this whole universe we inhabit and, consequently, create.Being mindful is part of the exercise in this game...practice in conscious paradigm shift?Decide for yourself."
4,Transformation game,"Game was billed ""used like new"". Missing a few pieces -- I ended up copying two 8x10 game cards. Rest of game was in very good condition."
5,truly transformational,"We have played this game numeruous times with many different people from ages 16 - 60, and the life lessons that show up are so amazingly ""perfect"", every time."
2,Good Intentions...,"It's become a tradition with a friend of mine to meet on our birthdays each year. We read each others (tarot and other) cards and it gives us a chance reflect on the past year - our experiences, lessons learned, future plans. The cards often provide additional insight. I thought the Transformation Game might provide the same kind of feedback and give us both more a chance to participate; but the game was tedious, the directions unclear and some of the game feedback was not very positive. (One feedback was along the lines of ""you haven't handled anger well, take 5 pain cards). I can see the intentions of the game and how it might work under some circumstances. But I think we'll stick with cards from now on. They are more specific, insightful and positive. Also cheaper."
1,Cats will not watch,"I had bought this type of dvd (Cat Sitter DVD) at the local pet store and my cats loved it, so I bought this one. My cats will not watch this dvd. It really is just someone taping in their yard. It does not keep up with the squirrels and shows them go off screen and then blur as they try to get the squirrels back into the frame. There are other better and much cheaper dvds for cats."
1,"Cats say, ""Do we look that stupid?""","After the initial five minutes of piped in chirps and one squirrel walking around, (not even energetically walking), that is the look I got from both my cats, ""Do we look that stupid? You're kidding right?"" Don't waste your money on this item. The only good part of this was the endless loop option, which may entertain your feline companions (provided you have good entertainment) but would probably play hell on your DVD player if you are gone for long. If you have a VHS option try ""Video Catnip"". Lawrence and Rocky say two paws down, girl."
1,5 out 5 five cats agree. . this is a waste of money,I showed this to my cat and he wasn't interested at all. Then I lent to a few friends who had cats that had watched TV in the past and none of them were interested either. This video is terrible. The squirrels blend into the background so the cat can barely see them.
4,Love it!,"My cats are a bit daft but they found this DVD to be amazing! Hef, my big boy, paws at the screen and meows. Charles, my other guy, stares intently at the screen for hours! You know, inside cats need some kind of sensory stimulant, and this is just what any indoor cat needs!"
1,squirrels not a pleaser,"My cats were not interested in squirrels. They really like small, flitting birds, darting fish and would probably like more bugs but can't find a video with lots of bugs."
2,Ok for the price,"The sound is pretty good. One of the 1"" tweeters rattles a bit though. Next time I will buy nicer speakers."
1,Pyle of junk - lasted 8 months,Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and buy a set of speakers that do not fail in 8 months.
5,Victory in the Wilderness,"This book came at a time in my life when I needed help getting ""through"" my wilderness. John Bevere has been there and his insights helped me to understand I am only passing through this hard time and God will use it in His timing."
1,Too Elementary,This unit plan contains some very basic/recall type quizzes and tests--not great for advanced high school students.
1,Unerving Ride,"I thought these might be the ticket for my 2001 2500HD Silverado but I knew they wouldn't work as soon as I drove with them. Any curve or sudden movement immediately allows the rear end to sway excessively. For a shock that is designed for a high profile vehicle, it does not provide stabiity for a basic pickup truck. I immediately order Bilstein shocks and replaced the Monroe's immediately--What a pleasant difference."
5,A tremendous album!,"A must-have for any fan of synthpop! Exceptional songwriting highlights this disk, there isn't a weak track among them. How many bands strive for years to achieve a work as accomplished as Iris? Here's to hoping they continue...Favorite tracks: 'Lose in wanting', 'The way I live my life',& 'Annie, would I lie to you'Had I been aware of this band in 1999, it would have been my top album of the year!"
3,It Wants To Be A Leatherman Micra,"I purchased a new SOG CrossCut to see how it would compare with my Leatherman Micra.There is no comparison. The SOG is inferior.The scissors became loose within a week of use, and now will not cut warm butter. The overall quality of the SOG CrossCut is mediocre at best in comparison to any Leatherman product.If you are going to use such a mini multitool often, and/or you are considering a larger multitool - avoid SOG. Buy a Leatherman.SOG customer service is a form of torture.Caveat Emptor!"
5,Big on this Pig,This book has an ease and flow You can read it fast or s l o w . The pictures add a playful touch My kids all like this book SO MUCH!
5,Only one problem,This fire safe meets my needs and expectations. The only problem is that the published combination series is left-right-left-right. This doesn't work but it does when you enter it right-left-right-left. The safe arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition.
1,Piece of junk,Not worth the money. Instructions for opening the safe are incorrect. The safe is sitting in the bottom of my trash can now.
2,"2 stars for honesty, 0 for inspiration","I bought Ray's book seeking insight into business and the personal qualities of a business man. The book contains little business insight, but is a complete autobiography of one of the most successful enterpreneirs of the century.Ray Kroc told his story with honesty and enthusiasm, but I am not richer for it. This surprised me, since I deeply believe in the virtues of individual opportunity, and Mr. Kroc lived his life by this creed.I was left cold by Mr. Kroc's single minded dedication to business during his entire life. Maybe that is what it takes to succeed on the scale that he did, but it isn't something I would wish on somebody I cared about.Ray's story taught me to make sure that my search for wealth and success does not consume me."
2,Not a Very Satisfying Meal!,"This book is like McDonald's - not very nourishing or satisfying! While I loved reading about Mr. Kroc's upbeat attitude and how he became so successful, I don't think the book was very well-written. (I couldn't believe it was written by a former journalist for the Chicago Tribune!) Nevertheless, I found many inspirational quotes in the book, such as the homily that Mr. Kroc recites ... that not even education and talent can make you a success. You need persistence, for the world is full of people who had the other two but never went too far."
2,"Ray Croc, a great businessman, not a great man or author","Ray Kroc's autobiography provides an interesting glimpse of the McDonald's system and it's development. The book is well written and interesting to read. Despite this, I do not recommend the book. It offers no wisdom or lessons learned to take away from the book besides Kroc's greatness. (Kroc never suffered from an excess of humility.) In addition, I found it difficult to like Kroc. He rarely found fault with himself and blamed others for his and his businesses problems. Particularly galling to me was when Kroc had the opportunity to invest in McDonalds and another earlier business opportunity, his wife of 30 years was unconvinced of the plans wisdom. Rather than spend the time to bring her aboard, he tossed her aside continued with his business plans."
3,How It's done!,"A very good book, a definite read for anyone looking to learn more about start up business or true entrepreneurship.Although, I think it's very important to look at the fact that things are much different now of days then when Ray Kroc started up Mcdonalds. It is very inspiring though to find out how old he was when he started this business. Though, it's nice to read of all these young kids starting up business, it's also nice to read about a man in his 50's finally doing a start up that he'd dream t of."
1,Just factual for 1970,"it is a overblown story, You can get same info on You tube, buy a burger you will be ahead of the game,"
5,Great book by a great entreprenuer,This book is an easy read and gives a new appreciation for the McDonalds brand as well as perspective on the ups and downs of business.
5,Great book!,This book really caught me. Just great. It shows how Mc evolved to be the company we know today!I read some negative reviews from some people that said that this book didn't inspire them... come on! Inspiration comes from inside yourself!
3,"Works OK, but connection is flaky","The tubes connect/disconnect fine with my Canon 5d mkiii, but any jostling of the lens will break the electrical connection and require a camera restart. This isn't too big a deal and the camer is usually on tripod (and still) for macro photography."
5,Great source of information,"I was looking to do more than what you normally find documented in Java and this gave me the details I needed. It has a lot of network protocol details right in the book so you don't have to keep switching between a protocol book and a Java book. Although it's titled, ""Beginning Java Networking"" it would also benefit an advanced Java programmer interested in writing networking programs."
2,Unorganized and bloated,"I bought this book in hopes that it would help guide me on the path to learn Java programming. Numbering over 1000 pages by several different authors, this book does not have a very consistent feel to it, and jumps around to various subjects about Java and various networking principles. The first 200 pages would be good for a university networking class, but as for being a decent tutorial, it is horrible. This book gives little code snippets here and there, but never fully combines them into one large, solid, and useful application.If you are looking for a book to act as a Java tutorial to networking, this is not the book for you. It is very comprehensive in some areas, and much more than many people are willing to spend in getting through sections of this book. However, if you are looking for a little more general purpose Java networking Bible, then this book might be more suited for you."
2,Very rough material,"I had to return this product to Target where I purchased it from. It was not only rough to touch, but it had a tear in it. On a positive note, it is very appealing and attractive, I just wish it was better quality."
3,Flimsy But Cute,"The quality of this sheet set isn't spectacular, but it is acceptable for a child. It is extremely thin, and the images aren't crisp. However, they are relatively soft considering the low 132-thread count. The fitted sheet was a good fit considering my son's mattress is fairly deep. Due to the flimsy feel of the sheets, I can't see these lasting through too many washes (especially as we go through potty training), but my son is happy with them nonetheless. He loves The King almost as much as Lightning McQueen, so it was great to find this set that featured him vs. so many that are mostly McQueen and/or Mater."
3,"Nice Pics, not so nice fabric","I got two sets for my 3 year old son and he loves them... He loves CARS.Me, not so much.The sheets are a bit thin and rough...not good quality fabric.I figure they are the type of sheets that will get softer but even thinner with repeated washings.I gave 3 stars because my son loves the characters on the sheets. The colours also mean dirt and stains don't show...great for little boys.I would buy again for him but just one set. I would invest in better quality sheets for when this phase is past."
4,Interesting stories and good for conceptualizing clients.,"I am always looking for case studies and this clinician has both thoughtful introductory remarks, and believable client stories. It is not overly analytic, but embraces an interpersonal approach along with a more dynamic frame for thinking about her clients."
5,Beautifully written and sensitive,"A beautifully written book - Luepnitz comes across as intelligent and educated, and genuinely sensitive and caring. Not at all preachy. An unusually delightful read."
1,too much for this used item,"very much,used the wrong telephone cord was in box but never mentioned in description before i purchased this item.the sender sent a very long cord and it didn't even match the product...their were also scratches on minnie's face,so saying it was like new was very deceptive!!"
3,"Comprehensive, but a bit overwhelming","If you can get past some of the ""preachy-ness"" and scientific jargon, it's a very comprehensive read on the subject matter."
3,Confusing,This book is not written clearly. It would benefit from summaries at the end of chapters. A good editor could do wonders for it. Understanding your fertility doesn't have to be that confusing. Try Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler.
2,Skip this one,"I found this book overly preachy and borderline offensive. The NFP instruction is helpful, but hard to stomach the morality statements in between. Instead try Toni Weschler's ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility""."
3,The Art of Natural Family Planning,This book has a lot of useful information - it did bother me at times because of religious stuffs in it.
1,I didn't like this book,"I bought The Art of Natural Family Planning because I want to learn the symto-thermal family planning technique. This book is textbook sized and way more than I needed to get the hang of things. It has a VERY strange Christian focus, which I was not prepared for. (An entire section of the book is called ""Does God care about birth control?), and they use terminology such as ""fornicating"" to describe un-married sex."
3,Elizabeth,"My husband and I took a class that used this book before getting married. I have read several books on the issue of ""fertility"" and I have to say that this book is indeed the one I find most clear in terms of explaining the rules to avoid pregnancy, and I also liked that it does not limit itself to temperature only or mucous only but rather lays out all the methods and allows the user to pick which one is best. The one point I want to disagree on is the view that this book is ""all you need"". It may be if you are trying to delay pregnancy, and have no fertility issues, but if you are trying to conceive and are having difficulties this is not the book for you. If you are not conceiving please do not assume that ""God does not want you to have children"". Other books you should try are ""Taking charge of your fertility"", and ""Fertility, Cycles, and Nutrition"", there are of course other very good books out there on the issue of infertility."
2,Not the best.,"I got this book on a recommendation from a friend of a friend. I'm interested in NFP, and a lot of the information in the book that I've read so far is good (haven't come close to finishing it!). However... I am a Christian, but not Catholic -- and the Catholic influence is major. Much more content relating to specific Catholic beliefs than I was expecting...and more than I care for, honestly.Guess I should have looked a bit more closely before purchasing it, and I don't have an alternative to suggest, but I wanted to extend fair warning to anyone else looking for something NFP-related with a spiritual element... I don't believe this is the book for everyone, so you might want to look closely before purchasing!"
4,"Great Resource, Needs a bit of Revision","This book is an excellent resource and NFP really is the best method for planning and postponing pregnancy. However, if you are not a Christian, you will find many of the biblical references unneccessary and, in some cases, offensive. I look forward to a new resource that is unbiased with respect to ALL faiths, men and women alike. Otherwise, this book is great."
4,This ia a textbook with a conservatve bias,"This book is meant to be a textbook for NFP classes run by the the Couple to Couple League. It's totally possible to learn Natural family Planning methods from it on your own, but it is not really set up as a general non-fiction book on the topic. It also has a very conservative Catholic bias; not to say that NFP can' or shouldn't be for any couple, but that liberal and/or non-religious couples might not appreciate a good amount of what this book as to say."
3,Two new Kippleys not new,"In an Oct 31 shipment of 2 and a Nov 2 shipment of two, one of the two Kippleys in each shipment were not truly new. The two Kippleys had this sticker on page ii--John & Celina Dellamorte, Teachers, Natural Family Planning, 508-833-9535. We can use them, but we should not have been charged for new books. A much more used Kippley was sent by Amazon in Sept. Amazon needs better quality control on books sent as that are not in their original shrink wrap. KLB"
2,confusing,"This book is comes with an extremely heavy religious focus. If you are interested in natural birth control from a secular standpoint, avoid this book. Even though the information is there, it is difficult to read because of the conservative language. People wishing to avoid pregnancy will not appreciate the emphasis on having children contained in this book. It is not comforting to have the authors of a book about family planing mentioning over and over again that an unplanned pregnancy is not such a bad thing. Even if you are Catholic,the book is overly complicated. I have read a number of books concerning the subject of natural birth control and this one was poorly organized and wordy. This book is the text book for the Couple to Couple League which is a pro-life, pro-chastity, anti-queer organization. If you do not wish to support these views, don't buy this book. Toni Weschler's book is clear and easy to use."
4,good reference book,"I am Catholic and learned NFP from Couple to Couple League. I am in disagreement with the confusing way the Kippleys don't distinguish between what is Church doctrine and what is their opinion (i.e. co-sleeping, ecological breastfeeding) but this is a good reference book. Buy it!"
5,Tacky - very nice!,"This ball is very tacky and appears to be very well made, and at an excellent price. I had researched a few different options before purchasing this Never Flat Football. I also had some input from some local sports stores. When I called inquiring about one of their best synthetic footballs (I know there will be some concrete time which would more quickly mar a leather ball), guess what they recommended? Yep. This one. Order it and have fun! Go Big Red!"
5,Great Football!!,"This is a great football for the price. The grip is great, it is a neverflat so it will take a long time for it to lose air. I would say over a year and a half with heavy use. You wont be wasting your money if you buy this."
2,Great concept bad result,"Never flat implies that the ball does not go flat. However after getting this for my son for Christmas and it coming flat due to the cold, I would recommend buying in a store vrs online."
2,NEVER FLAT - went FLAT,"After a couple of months of use, the NEVER FLAT football went flat. Very disappointed. I would like to return it. Is that possible?"
1,No Good!!!,"When I received this ball it was flat, not good for a ball called the never flat. Returned it and bought a Wilson. I DO NOT recommend."
2,Not my personal favorite,"This is a great football, but it only last a short while. If you buy this make sure to not have anything even slightly pointy around because it'll scrape it and pieces would come off. Mine had a small outer chunk peel off right before hitting a tree branch and going flat :/ avoid trees!"
1,Outer cover is not durable.,"After the first use the outer cover ripped. I have owned many footballs and never has the outer cover ripped. It looks very durable inside the outer cover, but the outer cover is quite thin."
5,Awesome,Great ball. The grip is amazing and throws a nice tight spiral. Even when wet the grip was surprisingly good. Highly recommend it
5,Very happy,I'm so tired of having balls that deflate and you can't find a pump so I very happy that I received it in a timely fashion and that it won't go flat. I don't ever seem to have any problems with buying from amazon.
4,Wonderful Historical Document,"This appears to be the only available recording of Flotow's absolutely delightful opera. Luckily, it is a terrific re-mastering of an early 40's recording featuring definitive performances as the two leads by Erna Berger and Peter Anders. The conducting is lively, and all of the performances convincing. Most surprising, the sound is amazingly good (the fact that it isn't up to ""modern standards is the only reason for a less-than-perfect rating)."
4,"Unconventional, but great series","Key is easily one of my favorite anime series. Although it follows the anime style, it is quite unconventional for an anime. After watching the first couple tapes of this series, I has no idea what genre it was; it obviously has sci-fi elements, some action scenes (thought not many) and it is full of dramatic elements of the dark, melancholy mood the Key does well. There are so many reasons to watch the series: incredible character design, quality animation and great cinematography, and most of all a plot that forces you to watch the series to its very end."
2,DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE,I bought this series after years of wanting to see it. The reviews on here were fairly good and the trailer looked interesting. Now I am a fan of all different types of anime. I own close to 300 box sets from all differrent eras and this is one that I would definetely tell people to pass on. Its not that the show is awful like BLACK HEAVEN or EXCEL SAGA. Key is( just kinda boring. Through the whole show i waited for something interesting to happen. The motives of all the characters were unclear. The one redeeming factor is the animation. The visuals are very nice for an anime of this period. However the animation is not good enough to keep you interested. I would only recommend renting this (if you can find it) or borrow from a friend.
3,Good graphics,"I like this anime, but not enough to buy it. I really like the graphics and the plot, but, like Witch Hunter robin, everthing's a bit dull. Every episode is very connected to each other. Also, there isn't much action (violence or other ^_~). It's worth renting, but not buying."
4,Awesome Live,Used to catch these guys live in Chicago. This is a great album that almost conveys their energy on stage. Buy it - you'll like it! I swear.
1,For the integrity of Christianity withdraw the book! Please!,"Unfortunately Dr Humphreys has crossed his area of expertise and attempted to take on Einstein cosmology, but to no avail. Dr. Humphreys is hurting Christianity without realizing it."
4,An elegant answer to a long-standing puzzle.,"I found Dr. Humphreys' theory to be well thought out. I like his honesty in addressing potential problem areas in the theory. The book is both simple enough to understand without a physics degree and yet contains the necessary equations for those who would ""look over his shoulder"" at his work. I truly enjoyed reading it."
2,Disappointing & short,"I found this book disappointing as a creationist perspective on the universe. The first thing you should know is that there are only about 30 pages of content accessible to a layman, the rest is basically Dr. Humphrey's published research. As for the theory, parts of it sound great, but ultimately he cedes the entire formation of the universe to an evolutionary time scale & formation model. Basically his argument is: here's how I can account for however many billions or trillions of years secular science says it took the universe to form, using all their models of planet & star formation (slow & gradual accumulation of matter into galaxies, stars, planets etc) - but using this white hole theory, it could have taken just a day on earth as the universe expanded! It just didn't make sense to me as a good creation model, one where God made a mature earth, mature plants, mature animals & mature man - but used relativity to happenstance out a universe?"
5,Very Intellectual,"This book is very scientific. Although it's not necessary to be knowledgable in the physics field, it sure does help. It's not meant for the casual reader. I think it makes some great hypothesis' and theoretical assumptions. It is always great to see what a Christian worldview and intellegent thought can come up with. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Starlight and Time; A good read,"Starlight and Time is a very interesting read for those who are trying to understand the young earth (creation) position. D. Russell Humphrey's relativistic cosmology is a very interesting theory. I'm just starting to look at this area in cosmology and it is nice to see scientists that are not willing to follow just the standard positions but are willing to find truth were ever it goes, even to God."
4,Worded very well,"The theory presented in this book has had a couple incarnations, even a few in the secular arena. It is a solid exposition on general relativity, but you will find that only a diligent worker will find this information in secular journals because it so clearly contradicts the magical bag of time that a 'old' earth religion needs (such as evolution). A similar work was done by a couple of evolutionist russians whose names escape me at the moment. However, they never got anywhere because their peers found it to blasphemous to the current evolutionary construct. If you want to see what their work was headed for, get this book."
5,Original cosmological theory acciesible to most,"RH offers a very original view of cosmological origins accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of relativity and/or a desire to explore this area. Math is there for those that want it. This is a potentially important book for those trying to understand the apparent age of the universe in light of literal ""6 day"" creation models. I really liked it and havn't heard anyone present a serious challenge to RH's analysis yet. It made sense to me but I'm a bit limited as to the math."
1,Nonsense masquerading as science,There is no puzzle of distant starlight in a young universe because there isn't a young universe. Challenging orthodoxy is valuable but not when the premise is based on the rubbish that this book is based. Anyone who uses this book to shore up their christian faith is deluding themselves and hasn't got a faith worthy of the name
4,appears,It loo ks like Dr.Humphreys may have found a potential solution to the young- earth / old-earth controversy. Enjoyable read keep up the good reaserch.
3,Interesting Theory,"The greatest thing this book has going for itself is that Dr. Humphreys (unlike one of his well-known reviewers) is an excellent writer. His book was easy to read and included some helpful graphics, which is why I gave it 3 stars.However after reading the book I found it interesting the the young-earth creationist camp would be so eager to embrace this White Hole Cosmology.... it is simply a variation of the Big Bang theory. Humphreys merely combines the standard Big Bang theory with Special (God's supernatural) Creation in a way that is receiving criticism from fellow YECs and scientists alike."
1,This book is hilarious - five stars,Oh it's meant to be a real scientific thesis. In that case no stars!
1,Twist the facts and you can prove anything,This book proves nothing other than that human ingenuity for 'proving' what they already know to be true knows no bounds. If you think this book shows you the scientific 'truth' I've got a few bridges you might like to buy.
5,A Must Read book for preparing for the SAT math portion,I just took my SAT's a couple of weeks ago. I read the book and thought it was great. Keller introduces many interesting tactics and strategies for taking the SAT. He tells the reader which questions to answer and which ones to omit if you are low on time. He creates personal plans for students who want to get a specific score. The book also has a little humor in some places. I highly recommend this book!
4,Miles and miles of smiles,"My 3 month old son loves to smile and laugh at himself in the mirror. I am a little disappointed in the way it attaches to the crib. He can't see himself while lying in the crib because the mirror angle goes upward. I is perfect for ""tummy time"" though."
4,Ocean wonders mirror,"We put this on the floor for our grandson to entice him into crawling. He responded to the ""baby"" in the toy and when he touched the ""fish"" he liked the different noises that it made. His favorite dangly object was the crinkle starfish, the next was the chew toy crab and the clam he has just started holding...it doesn't work well with small hands. He liked the sound it made, but hasn't figured out how to make it do its noise."
1,POOR QUALITY,TOY IS QUITE JUNKY AND DOES NOT SEEM TO BE AT ALL WHAT IT APPEARS. I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS TOY IF I WERE YOU. IT IS NOT REALLY SOMETHING THAT YOUR BABY WILL ENJOY TRUST ME YOU WILL REGRET THIS PURCHASE.
3,"Average book, not stellar","I like Tom's approach to explaining BPM and a rules approach using a real world example. The book had numerous typo's, and I found it hard to believe it made it through the publisher with so many errors. I also found the overall organization of the book to be fair, but the details on each section were not so. Being in the industry, I was expecting more for the money. This book provides a good overview, but not recommended if you plan on moving from discovery into implementation."
2,Uneven approach,"As a knowledgeable architect wanting SME, this did not provide much help for me. Plus: OK treatment of BPEL and reasonable examples of code. Con: Riddled with ridiculous and poor cartoon illustrations. Too many descriptions of services as probable recapitulations of author's projects. Flow diagrams disorganized. Instead of teaching a subject area, this is a 1st person memoir of uninteresting, unchallenging projects."
4,lovely *gift-sized* book,"My mom adores roses so every year I try and find her a book about them. This was a great addition to her collection- the photos are beautiful, and it's a *lovely* book from start to finish. The only issue that i would note is that it is a ""gift size"" book (smaller than your average photo book, which tends to be oversized). But the amount of pages and gorgeous photos make it a wonderful purchase."
3,Good book for reports,This book was very discriptive and gave important information on the women that started the Women's Movement and how they succeeded in their efforts to get the movement to where it is now.
5,they're hard to find,"I came across The Hong Kong tonight and have been able to find quite a sample on-line but have been only able to find 1 CD. This is a shame. Above, it was said that they are a band for the times but they are also a band for 1979. They sound remarkably like Blondie. and I love Blondie."
5,Nice fire file safe for home or home office use,"I bought this model fire safe after reading several reviews of less-expensive brands available at local ""superstores."" This safe is well worth the extra money. The construction quality is excellent, the latch mechanism works very nicely, and it seals up tightly when the latch is closed. I strongly recommend buying the optional wheeled stand. This safe would be hard to move around without them, but is very convenient to move around on the wheels. You can put the stand together with only a screwdriver and a wrench (even pliers if you don't have a wrench,) and the stand is custom-sized to fit the safe. Hanging file folders fit right in with no problems, and make this safe easy to organize. I am very happy with this fire safe."
4,Inspiring a Movie,"This is a pretty good book about John Wilmot (aka the Earl of Rochester), who is not well known, but surely will be soon - due to a movie starring Johnny Depp coming out. As a poet, Wilmot is entertaining and virile. He is obscene and satirical. ""The Libertine"" does a good job of expressing this, sharing his life, exploring his reasoning for his satire of King Charles, his heroism, the balance between reason and humor that seems to be the dichotomy of Wilmot. We'll see how well the movie does. But, it would be great if people starting actually reading his poetry.Another book I recently enjoyed that is like a modern-equivalent of Wilmot is ""The Loony,"" a story about a guy also sort of exiled, who is also a libertine, also afflicted with a penchant for perversity, and also destined for a bad end. It was interesting to read one after the other, as they shared so many interesting attributes. I look forward to the movie, and hope it bring Wilmot more readers."
2,meh,"I bought these last winter because it was my first winter in New England and I wanted something for icy sidewalks and neighborhoods - these were fine for that (and cheap - so if you're just going around town, they're probably plenty). However, the first time I wore them hiking in snow, I lost one within the first half-mile. I didn't notice immediately, though, so I never found it. (They had slipped off other times in not-very-deep snow in my neighborhood, but I had always noticed before and been able to backtrack and find them.) You could probably use rope or something to add an extra strap over the foot, but since I had to buy a new pair anyway, I went with MicroSpikes (more expensive, but much more secure!). I also noticed they were slippery on indoor floors, but you don't want to wear ice cleats inside anyway.For light use, these may be worth $20 - but if you're doing any walking/hiking/running in snow, I prefer more secure cleats with more substantial spikes."
2,Ridiculous sizing!,"The cleats themselves actually look like a good quality product but I would never know for sure as I have returned them 5 minutes after I opened the box! The sizing must be either for sneakers or bare feet lol! There is no way these cleats would fit on a work boot or any type of hunting/pac boot. I ordered the extra large which is supposed to be for size 13+, ""I wear a size 11.5-12"" knowing they would be tight as per other reviews and when I tried the product it would not fit on any of my boots. When I finally stretched it over my hiking shoes ""not boots"" it still barley fit properly. If you want these for sneakers or light hiking shoes they may work but there is no way to make them work on a ""man sized"" foot for ice fishing or work boots. If there is a XXL I don't think it will work out. The boots in the pic must be a size 9 or 10 with an XL size cleat...its that inaccurate. Too bad really because they looked perfect online."
5,GREAT!!!!,"Just picked up the STABILicer Lites for staying safe on the roof (shoveling) and general use - we live off a dirt road so it can become quite icy this time of year. They are well made, comfortable and really do make a difference when conditions are slick. Our YakTrax rusted so I am pleased with a product that is durable and would chose STABILicers over other brands. I have even become a fan![...]"
3,They slip off,"I live in Wisconsin - lots of snow and ice. I walk 4 miles everyday at the dogpark and have been using YakTrax Pro for about 4 years. The Jazebra cleats work good on ice with a light snow cover, but fall off easily - they need a stronger top band and at least an option for a strap to go over your foot. They are good (even better) for a limited type of ice/snow but not as comfortable as the YakTrax. The 2 can be found at about the same price - but only go with the YakTrax Pro."
3,They only work as long as they stay on,"I bought these at REI and they really do keep you from falling down. I used them quite a bit today and there is a downside. As I was stepping out of some snow and back onto the (icy) sidewalk I slipped and fell. I couldn't believe that that had happened since these had given me such good traction when I put them on. When I looked down I saw that one of them had come off and that I had slipped as a result of expecting more traction than I had. I put it back on and made sure that it was nice and secure, yet the same thing happened at least 3 more times. The strange thing is that every time it was the same one that came off, the other one stayed put all day."
4,Best option for stable footing,"After a lengthy research for options for stable footing on slippery/icy/wet surfaces, I chose to get the Stabilizers Lite Ice Cleats based on overall reviews from other users.I must say when on the slippery snowy/icy surface my footing was excellent and never once felt unsure in my footing snow blowing my steep driveway. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 was that on dry surface within my garage after clearing the snow, one of them slid sideways off my boot causing me to go to the ground.Not sure what they could do to make them grip more firmly around the footwear but would recommend that keeping your weight either forward or backward - not sideways - when walking or stepping will prevent this from probably happening.Definitely would recommend them though..."
5,They remove fear,"These things (as long as they stay on) turn a morning walk in the northeast winter from a somewhat scary event to a ""walk in the park"". No careful placing of each step to avoid an invisible ice patch since with these on tract;ion is always there. The only problem is they sometimes come off the boot and I'm not immediately aware of it. That necessitates a search of the past hundred feet or so. Fortunately, the black shows up clearly against the white snow."
5,WORK GREAT,"These are easy to slip on, wish the width was a bit wider but with some adjusting you can position these just fine. Haven't had any of them fall off and they do grip the ice alot better than previous brands i've tried before. For now these are just right.."
2,Slips off boots,"Straps are inadequate to keep the Stabilicers on my boots. I ordered the large size thinking it should fit my size 11 Merrell boots; it doesn't. Too short, consequently the front strap slips off the front of the boot. The product really needs another strap around the instep.Since I bought these last season (and never used them until yesterday) I can no longer return them. So I'll experiment by using Velcro to hold the stabilicers onto my boots. Might work.They are easy to get on/off and will probably do a good job of providing traction -if I can find a way to keep them on!"
4,runs small but works great,runs small but works great. I have a very icy walkway and so far these work great. Good for Ice and snow
3,They don't give sizes,"until you buy them. IOW, they don't tell you what men's shoe sizes are considered medium, large, small, etc. At least I couldn't find it.That being said, the ones I ordered, while too small, seemed to be very high quality. I ordered medium and it looks like I will need large. I will order again. Can't return, because I didn't save the packaging."
2,Doesn't fit my wide feet,"Gave these a try in some ice and snow, and I'm glad I tested them before taking them on a real trek. They slipped off of my shoes constantly. I kid you not, I replaced the right side, took 3 steps and the left side was off. Looking at them on my shoes, they don't seem to accommodate the width of my shoes. Talked with 32North, and they sent me powerstraps to try out, we'll see if that helps. Maybe they should come with powerstraps in the first place?"
1,"eh, its decent","Hello, i first off would like to say that the sizes that are listed are not true, my size large will not fit my size 12 shoe. Secondly, two layers of the spikes have separated from the orange rubber, and i haven't even used them yet. i will be giving these a 1 star rating ."
1,These Were A RIPOFF,"I bought these because they are inexpensive and was told on the package they'd fit myman's size 12 boots. NOT TRUE; they were too narrow and short to even measuremy boots, much less fit. The photo is an embarrassing joke; it lead me to think thecleats would fit, but is deceitful."
3,Traction Cleats,The product did not have spikes as shown in the picture. There were just little bended metal studs. The rubber is very soft und I am afraid I use it and it will break.
2,"Good quality, but not for urban walkers","A) As other reviewers mentioned they do slip off. I had to make a strap so I wouldn't lose one. B) worst of all even if a shop at a facility that has floors which won't be damaged by the cleats, wearing these inside is like walking on an ice rink...you will kill yourself. c) few retailers have a bench or chair near the entrance where you can't put these on and off.They would be fine for people who drive to an outdoor location where they walk for exercise, but totally unsuitable for exurbanites who incorporate walking into their daily lives."
1,falls off!,"I bought these to walk on nearby snowy/icy trails with my dog, but they slipped off every few hundred feet. Finally got so frustrated I threw them away."
5,stay on your feet,These are great ice cleats. I have a different brand with 6 points on each foot but these have better traction and grip because the cleats are all over the bottom. Hope I won't need them next year!
3,Do not last,"I have been able to stay in the up right position; however, the durability of the rubber sucks; in fact, in less than a month, mine are falling apart."
3,No more slipping on the black ice,feel a little weird but no more slipping on the black ice of upstate NY. A bit hard to get on and off at first but well worth the effort if you are like me and have fallen at least three times this winter.
5,GREAT!! best snow/ice product,GREAT!! best snow/ice product I have ever used. When walking down a hill no slip at all. Highly recommend if you walk outside on ice and don't want to fall..
3,They'd be great if they'd only stay on,"I wish I'd read the many reviews here, which decry the Stabilicers' inability to stay on. This is decidedly the case. The design is excellent and the front and back spikes provide good grip, but only when they remain on the boot. And with any sort of serious trekking, they don't. I'm giving them a 3 star, however, because they are affordable and might be a decent value for light-duty use. If you do buy these, order a size smaller and get them in a bright color so you can find them easier when they fall off."
2,These won't stay on my boots.,I would love these if they would stay on but they keep falling off and I have to back track to find them. Not worth it. Very disappointing.
4,balance problem,"This is overall a good product, it goes on easily and stays in place. The one problem that I found was the width of the heel which is smaller that the stabilicers which throws your ankle to one side or the other. Kind of like trying to walking on high heels."
5,Fantastic! I never slip when I wear these...,"I've walked on ice several times with these on, and felt very secure. They're not difficult to put on, and they're very handy here in Maryland, where we often get ""wintry mix"" that freezes into ice."
3,They work BUT................,"These things really dig into the ice good, the rubber seems to be of decent quality that should last. My shoe size is a 14 and they do barely stretch around my Keen Industrial boots. The biggest problem is that the cleats are spread out too far apart making it uncomfortable on my feet when walking. Your body weight is not distributed well enough putting pressure right on the cleats. The front cleat is right below my toes and the back cleat is on my heel making a big gap between the two that make my foot sore from flexing between that gap. When you are in snow you dont notice it much, but when you are on the hard ice or even pavement it is very uncomfortable. The cleats should be better place so your body weight is distributed better."
2,Only good for a few trips..then forget it!,"These are good if you are only going to the mailbox. If you need to go up or down a hill you should get your affairs in order. It's not that they don't grip, they stretch out and FALL OFF! I lost one in the dark and never found it. The other one has fallen off 3 times walking 10 feet...don't wast your money unless you don't plan on going anywhere with these."
5,Perfect for tromping around in snow and ice!,"I got two pair of this type of product: Yaktrax Walkers and these STABILicers Lite Ice Cleats.These STABILicers Lite Ice Cleats w1n! I use them for walking around on base in Afghanistan where the snow melts during the day leaving a lot of treacherous black ice around. These suckers cut thru the ice like a hot knife thru butter. I can run with these on, the Yaktrax Walkers, not so much. I still slid a tiny bit with the Yaktrax on ice, but these STABILicers Lite Ice Cleats bite right thru it.Happy and confident walking around in winter weather!Note: My boots are Oakleys, size 6.5 mens. These cleats fit tightly, but it's perfect so they don't slip off."
4,Easier than expected,"It was a lot easier to put on and to remove these than I had expected, and they work great on my office shoes which would otherwise have no traction at all on ice or snow.But don't wear them on indoors on hard floors like smooth concrete, tile or polished stone because they won't have any traction. Be especially careful not to wear them on smooth stairs!"
4,"Great traction, not comfy on clear pavement","I bought these for my husband to wear when running on snow and ice over the winter. They definitely provided traction and increased his confidence and efficiency while running. However, they were uncomfortable when walking on clear pavement despite the even distribution of spikes on the ball of the foot and the heel."
2,Not for Hiking,"Very simple: My Large-sized ice cleats (designed for sizes 10.5-13 shoes) repeatedly came off my size 11 boots while hiking. I lost count the number of times they came off, but it was at least 6 or 7 times in just 1 1/2 miles of hiking on packed trail snow. That meant that I had to hike basically looking at my feet the entire time to be sure that both were there and I wouldn't have to backtrack to find the missing cleat.Other than that, their performance was adequate on the snow with much better grip on the icy patches."
2,Too small,"I bought medium according to the size chat, but they are too small for my size-8 snow boots. It is difficult to put them on my boots, and they don't stay on. They are, however, fine for regular size-8 shoes. I would recommend buying large if intend to use on snow boots."
3,"Just got this, haven't used it yet","Looks good, fits the shoe well. I haven't used it because it has been raining like the world is coming to an end.... I'll update it when I see some snow / ice on ground and get to actually use this."
2,FLIMSY SYNTHETIC RUBBER MATERIAL,"I BOUGHT A PAIR FOR MYSELF AND MOTHER. I HAVE NOT USED IT YET, BUT I AM GIVING IT TWO STARS BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IT LOOK AND FEEL CHEAP, IT DOES NOT GRIP MY SHOES VERY WELL WHEN I TRIED THEM ON AND I FEEL LIKE THEY WILL SLIDE OFF MY SHOES IF I AM IN A BAD STORM. I TRIED IT ON SEVERAL PAIRS OF SHOES AND STILL DID NOT FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THEY WILL DO THE JOB COME THE SNOW AND ICE. I WILL RETURN TO WRITE A REVIEW IN A FEW MONTH'S AFTER I HAVE FULLY RATED ITS PERFORMANCE, BUT I BELIEVE A PRODUCT SHOULD IMPRESS ITS BUYER EMEDIATELY. STILL, I WILL GIVE IT A CHANCE."
4,Ice Cleats save your bones!,I finally purchased these.....been talking about it for years. A couple yrs ago I slipped on the ice and fractured a disc in my back. These are working great so far! Although it is definitely a 2 handed operation......getting them on and off.
3,not too stable,I have tried them on two different pairs of shoes and they keep falling off !My shoes are 10 1/2 . I ordered medium per your size guide. unhappy! Melb
3,Stabilicers Lite,Received them on time as promised. Basically satisfied with the ice cleats but for the price they could be a little more robust: to mount more securely on the boot. Walked out of one during work travels and did not notice it was missing until a few additional customer stops. Had to back track to several homes to find the lost one. Next time I will look for a set that fits over the top of the toe and farther up on the heal of the boot and has a wider/thicker rubber mounting system.
4,no more slipping,"i love them! i would have given it five stars if it wasnt such a struggle to put them over my boots. My mother-in-law even has a pair!it is pretty handy on those winter days when its icy out. very helpful especially when walking the dogs, no more dodging those icy puddles on the sidewalk!"
4,Horse out of the barn...,"I must admit I fell during a February ice storm here in the Midwest and fractured a rib! That was not a pleasant experience. So after the fact I went looking for something to prevent that from happening in the future. Although I have not ""officially"" used them (no ice since my fall) these cleats do fit my shoes very well and appear to be able to do the job. So, as my wife says I closed the door after the horse was already out of the barn so to speak but I am ready for the next time (ha)."
2,Not the answer,"I was looking for the answer to Yak Traks which always get lost because they won't stay on the shoe. These looked very promising but alas suffer the same fate as most shoe grips. They might be OK walking on a slippery New York street but they're not suitable for serious mountain wear. The grip is very good with these, and the rubber is much sturdier than Yak Traks but poor design gives them a thumbs down. All they need to do is have a simple velcro strap going over the instep and they'd have a winner. They were sized correctly and working on a pair of Sorels, but they slipped off several times during the first few weeks of use and now in under a month I've lost one for good. Waste of money for mountain folks, probably fine for city slickers."
3,cleats,We haven't had icy conditions yet. but want to make sure that my husband has sure footing when getting out of his work truck! A good precaution for him
2,Cleats: Not comfortable,We bought these cleats for the springs of Alaska. I bought a small size wearing a 8 in womans and they are snug.. i would recommend going a size up. Both my husband and I don't care for these. They are not comfortable to wear. You feel like you are walking on stilts. However they do grip well. They were cheaper than the higher quality so I suppose we got what we paid for. We recommend put the extra money out for a better quality cleat.
2,THIRD TIME I HAVE BEEN SUCKERED.,LOST ONE OF THE CLEATS AFTER ONLY ONE WEEK. PAST TWO YEARS DIDN'T FAIR ANY BODY. WON'T BE SUCKERED AGAIN.
4,works great for me!,"Very impressed with fit and grip on ice and in snow. Just a short trial run on steep driveway, held very well on hard ice. Also tried jogging in 6' to 8"" deep snow and the seemed to hold on quite well. Note: Order 1 size larger than chart, I wear size 11 snow boots and ordered extra large Stabilicers. They fit very snug for me. Because of the concentration of metal grips under heel and toe area I don't think they would be good for jogging longer distances on a hard surface."
1,Lasted 1 season,Just got these out since we are expecting snow tomorrow here in the No. Ga. mountains.The rubber on each one has split in two at the main front toe section on each side. You can easily see the rubber just cracked in several places and broke in two. They were stored in my closet in a cloth over the door shoe holder. Obviously there was some sort of quality control rubber problem with these.They are now worthless since there is no way to repair the splits....I've just ordered Yaktrax....That's what my neighbors swear by and theirs from last year are in perfect condition and.....less expensive !
5,Great for Walking the Dog,Some of my neighbors are not good at clearing their sidewalks. They tend to get icy. These ice cleats do an excellent job of providing good traction. No slipping or sliding. Like walking on a clear sidewalk. Fitting on the shoe was easy and secure. Well worth the investment.
4,Unusual *RING*,"I like unusual rings and the MAN IN THE MOON STERLING RING from Eve's Addiction is very nice.It's light-weight and the band is a lot thinner then I expected, but it's cool looking. The diameter through the moon face measures about 11/16"" and the ring is stamped with ""925"" on the inside.The moon face ring isn't gaudy, but very subtle and it fits true to size. It comes packaged in a small cloth bag which is inside a cardboard box and is ready for gift wrapping."
4,Damn crossroads...,"THe final episodes of Season 2 were just wonderful. A bit disappointed in what Zuko did, but then you can;t have a story without twists and turns."
5,Another Brilliant Worship Mix!,"This CD is very anointed. I love it and highly recommend it. Jason Upton invites you to join him before the throne to worship the King.Psalm 23, is one of my favorite songs. There is such power in singing/ praying the Word of God. It is so beautiful.Wait Upon the wind is a song for everyone. The revelation that we are to wait upon the Lord in all aspects of our lives.Jason received the song ""Teach Me How To Pray"" when praying for Indonesia; it is a powerful testimony to the power of prayer and the reality of the sacrifice that Christians are living in other parts of the world.I recommend this CD to anyone looking for profound and passionate worship. Enjoy!"
4,good western,"If you like Roy, this movie is a typical Roy Rogers movie.I need more words to complete this review, so I added this sentence."
5,In All Deep Places touches deeply!,"Susan Meissner is very gifted in captivating a reader's attention from the first page through the end of the last. In All Deep Places brings characters to life that a reader can relate to and care about. It takes you on a journey of faith, and transitions from present to past and back to present easily.In this book, like her previous ones, I found a story that is not only thought provoking, but soul stirring and heart touching as well. I can't wait to read the next book God gives her!!"
5,Gooooo with the Swingline Premium Commercial Stapler,Swingline Premium Commercial = ProfessionalSwingline 747 = AmateurDo yourself a favor and buy this stapler. You won't buy another till it goes missing from your desk.
1,Bad socks Bad customer service,"I bought white cotton socks from a Sams club in MI. Every sock wore out in the heel after 3 to 4 wearings.I e-mailed and then sent a sock back to the company, and never heard a word back. If I am a example of how they do business,I would discourage people from buying their product-I never will again."
5,The best!,"The Gold Toes socks are the only socks we buy. They hold their shape wash after wash. They are a little more costly than other brands, but well worth the difference."
3,A little small & thin.,"My husband wears a size 12 1/2 shoe and we've finally started searching for extended length socks. We ordered these for him as spring is around the corner and he said they are pretty good. They fit him, but he said he can not understand how someone with a size 14 or 15 foot would fit in them, and certainly not a size 16. Also, he said they are thin. I told him that for summer wear, that will be fine, but I am concerned now about wear.They'll do, but we won't buy any more."
5,great socks,"Yeh, these are really great socks... but what's up with James? If new socks changed my life, hey I need to get a little something goin' on. Back to the socks...my favorite, in black, low cut, workin' out or hangin' out."
2,Unhappy,Not what I expected. I have wore Gold Toe socks for many years and these do not live up to any of the others. I thought I would try the lower profile sock and I will not be buying more. I wear a size 13 shoe so I bought the extended 12 - 16 size. I compared them to a Gold Toe Extended 1/4 sock and they were much shorter. They are also much thinner and lightweight. The top part of the sock is very thin. I do not expect these to last long.
3,Beware of inaccurate ingredient list,"Just received my socks today, and saw that the make up ingredients are 75% cotton, 19% polyester, 5% nylon, 1% spandex - different from what was listed."
5,gold toe sock liners,the sock liners were fine - I was looking for an ultra thin sock and this was not...returned with no difficulties.
1,poor quality,"i have order the same socks in size 9-12 from amazon in the past with great results ,thick heavy cotton , cushionso i order the extended size 12 - 16 this timerec order in 2 days as alway's BUT these are not high quality socksthin cotton bottom;s , not worth the moneysmitty in VA"
4,good buy,"These are ok. They don't bunch up, are comfortable, and look good. That's really all you can ask for. I will buy again. They have held up well after a few months."
2,wide feet,the sock needs to be much wider for people with very wide feet. thank youvery much happy new year
4,Socks for size 14 shoe,"The socks are advertised as larger than typical men's socks (those that fit size 9-12 shoe), though they seemed to shrink up in the washer/dryer. I hope they stretch to the larger size after being worn or we didn't receive the product we anticipated."
2,Don't buy if you mind your socks slipping down,"I normally like Gold Toe products, but the ankle elastic on these is so weak that there is no tension keeping the socks up. They slide down into your shoe with vigorous activity. Very annoying."
1,"Used to be good quality, what happened?",Gold toe used to be good quality. I have purchased them for my husband before with no problem. He wears size 15 shoe and Gold Toe used to have nice extended size socks. He just opened the pack and noticed that the seams on at least 2 socks are ripping at the toe! The sock is also very short and does not represent the extended size at all. I would not recommend this sock at all! Too bad the quality has taken such a hit.
1,Disappointing for Gold Toe,"these socks are terrible they dont stay up they keep sliding off the heel. very disappointing for a Gold toe sock, I usually have no problem with their products. the socks are otherwise soft and comfortable."
5,Comfy socks,Love theses socks . Very comfortable and durable. Have been wearing these socks for a long time. Would highly recommend.
2,Not all socks are created the same.,"My recent purchase has left me with mixed reviews. So far I've wore eight of fourteen socks I've purchased. One of the socks had a seam open up after one use. Fit and feel were fine, but with one pair in the trash already Im not sure of the value. Time will tell......"
3,Gold Toe Socks Are Smaller Than Expected,"These socks have a thick gold cushion that will protect the toes. The sole of the socks is noticeably thicker than the top half, which can be seen though when stretched over the foot. The opening of the sock is tight, making them difficult to slip on and off easily. The opening feels like there is a thread that will eventually break. The socks are labeled 12-16 but are very tight even on a size 13 foot.Overall, these are great quality, but the size is misleading. Ultimately, they were returned for a refund."
1,Still Shedding !!!!,"6 months after buying these socks, and after being washed at least 15-20 times. The socks still shed lint every time i put them up. Terrible product. Do not buy"
1,SOCK ORDER,When we received the socks they were the wrong size. We ordered size 10-13 and got size 8-10. We sent them back with a note in them that they were the wrong size and that the order had the right size on it (we even sent a copy). Instead of sending us the right size we received a credit instead which was not the full price that we paid for the item. I felt that I should of gotten a full refund beings it was your fault for sending the wrong size. I will never order anything from Amazon again. I wish they was a phone number that I could of called for assistance.
2,Does Not Stay On,"I don't know if it is my feet, but these socks do not like to stay on. The heel of this sock slowly slides under my foot to have to adjust often."
4,Great for Day to Day use!,These socks are the most comfortable white socks that I have found! I love a good thick wool sock but these little guys fit snuggly and are a great option in the summer and for use in athletic shoes.
1,Lint Everywhere!,"I bought two packs of these socks to replace my old ones. (I wanted to have only one kind of socks.) I chose the black ones because they look cleaner and suitable for various occasions. They are a little thin, but I already expected that. I must have clogged my shower drain the first 2 weeks I wore these socks because of the loose pieces of black fabric that were stuck to my feet. Whatever, I thought, it happens from time to time in some materials, and it will go away away after a wash. I was wrong. Every time I wear these socks, my feet resemble black Hobbit's feet after =("
1,poor sizing,Bought the large size for my husband and they did not fit. Even before washing. They are tight and ride down. I would not buy them again!!!
2,top of heel too short,"I had hoped these socks would have fit correctly. however, the heel tops are cut too low, and constantly roll down when i put on shoes. These socks are a disappointment. I am sending this review in hopes the manufacturer will make future such socks higher in the heel top."
5,An inspired collection--every item a gem,"""Little Gems of Wisdom"" by J.D. Kroft is a most valuable addition to my bookshelf. This is an inspired collection of wisdom; ever item is indeed a gem. I read the book, cover to cover, and now it has a permanent place on by bookshelf, both as a source for the appropriate quote, and for browsing when I need personal support and inspiration. I have purchased several copies to give to family and friends.The book is organized and cross-referenced for quickly locating just the quote I need."
3,Not easy,"This storage is not easy to install (at least to me). You might need some help. Also, check your celing and wall first if they're capable to hold!"
2,screws are too short,"i dunno if my house is an odd ball, but the lag screws that came with the package are too short. Now I have to go get longer screws, i dont even want to install it now."
4,"Good, Simple Storage Solution","These things went up fairly easily, in about an hour for each as long as you know where all of your joist studs are located or have a really good stud finder. I wish they didn't sway quite so much after being installed, but they definitely hold up nicely to the weight that they say, and they feel rock-solid. For the price, these can't be beat, and with free shipping it is a lot easier than finding them at the local hardware store. A few clicks and a couple of days later I was drilling holes in my garage ceiling, and finally getting all of my clutter stored up and out of the way."
3,"works well enough, but wobbles","Product functions as you'd expect. Installation is relatively straightforward. Instructions could be better, though parts are more clearly labeled than with many products, and that's nice. Rack does wobble in one direction (though not in the other) when items are placed on or off. Design of wire shelf units does not make sliding items on/off the rack easy, since a few wires are slightly raised. But given the wobble, perhaps that's a feature rather than a shortcoming."
2,Contains soy and carob,"I got these mostly to supplement my dogs diet to help bring omega 3/6 ratios back into balance and was hopeful these were the version I found on Country Life's website that were a gelcap and fish oil only. I'll give them 2 stars for having 300mg of combined DHA and EPA, but knocking them (and Amazon for not having proper product ingredient descriptions) 3 stars for putting carob for coloring and Vit E (tocopherol) from soy. Neither of which are really species appropriate for dogs (not really sure if dogs should have carob anyway) and adding any unnecessary addings for color, etc are irritating."
3,"I'd rate this book as a ""mixed bag.""","This book is worth it just for the wonderful photographs. If you're a vintage purse lover, you're sure to see many bags you've never seen before! However, as a learning tool, be cautious. This book has many inaccuracies and the prices are fairly meaningless. Also, sadly the lucite bags featured, for the most part, are rather ordinary. A disappointing selection when there are so many more beautiful examples of these wonderful bags. (Also, some identified as lucite are not.) Still, if you're passionate about purses, you'll have to have this book!"
2,Not Good,"I bought this book to learn about trolling, and I was dissappointed. This book says a lot about nothing. All of the info he talks about is totally common sense, and leaves out all descriptive details concerning trolling tools, methods, lure presentation, color, action etc. The ""meat"" of his book concerns a chapter or two about how to ""accurately"" determine lure depth followed with charts plotting line diameter etc. only to be followed by a statement saying that every lure is different and that there really is no way to tell how deep you're running until you get out on the lake and hit bottom. If you want good books about trolling buy the books by Ken Shultz and Ed Rychkun."
1,not all that great,I expected more out of this book based on the supplied review. The chapters are remeadial and don't offer much useable information. Seems like he was trying to add a lot of filler B.S. to make the publisher happy. I would not recommend it.
3,trolling for fish,"This is a beginner's, basics book. If you are new to trolling, it will help you catch fish.If you are a trolling veteran, you may not learn as much.Wayne Heinz, author of, How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
4,Trolling,As I am a Beginner in Trolling this book has given me many hints how to go about trolling.For advanced trollers it may not be as interesting but also for advanced Trollers there might be some new aspects.
5,Passport was phenominal.,"This was more of a supergroup than a passport album.Klaus Doldinger led passport with some phenominal albums. In the 70's they were more along the lines of Deodato or Mahavishnu Orchestra. Then the 80's hit and they sounded more like Spyro Gyra.This is from 1975 and features some great guest apperances. The best one is Philip Catherine. Once a member of Focus and with his solo career, he put out some AWESOME jazz/rock albums.The standout cuts are MOST DEFINATELY: Abracadabra and Angel Wings. Compared To What is a good cover and Albatross Song isn't too shabby either.Check them out, you won't be disappointed!Please read and rate my other reviews."
2,Odor-Eaters: A Black First?,"Why, how-dee-do, it's Minister Farrakhan. Hear the enchanting sounds of the captives as they rise from that hold known as the Nation of Islam! You'll tremble at this study of ""Mein Kampf"" and thrill as da slaves rattle their chains and shake to the beat of Massa Louis's whip. But the real questions never seem to be addressed by anyone who visits a Nation mosque: Is Dr. Scholl's a black-owned company? Were Odor-eaters invented by Black Muslims? Why do black Muslim women seem to always have cans of Nair at the ready? Finally, just who applies the hot wax to the Minister's shining face? These are the questions Amazon readers want answered now -- before he (you-know-who) is too late."
4,Excellent but not perfect...,"This VHS collection, is the only ""official"" release of Betty Boop cartoons from Republic. It has all the cartoons, except one with Popeye and three or four others, considered lost back in 1998, when this collection first released (those cartoons already ""re-discovered"" on various private collections worldwide, maybe a future DVD collection gonna have them).The picture and the sound quality is great, compared the usual public domain DVDs you may have seen the last years.There is a problem through: It is called ""Digital Noise Reduction"" and it is the nightmare of the animation fans! This set here, is the obvious example of how bad DNR can be, when we use it on Cartoons. Beyond that, it is an excellent choice for Betty Boop fans, now!"
5,AWESOME SHOCKS,"I DRIVE A 2005 FORD F-150 4X4 CREW CAB. I TOW A FEW TOYS LIKE A 6000 POUND TRAVEL TRAILER AND A BOAT. I NOTICED MY REAR END WAS BOUNCING MORE THAN USUAL. I REMOVED TEH STOCK HEAVY DUTY SHOCKS FROM FORD AND THEY WERE JUNK, I MEAN REAL JUNK. I INSTALLED THESE MONROES AND WOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE THEY MADE. I JUST FINISHED A 170 MILE TRIP TOWING THROUGH THE MOUNTIANS AND THEY WERE GREAT. I NOTICED HUGE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WAY TRUCK TOWED AND DROVE. I RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE WHO TOWS."
5,Previous review was one star,"My previous one star review was based on not being able to find staples. Office Max even advised me that the stapler and its staples were no longer available. At that time I also couldn't find it or the staples online. I have since found staples that work (from another manufacturer) and, obviously, the stapler is still available from Amazon sources. It is a great stapler for stapling multiple pages. Not so great for just a few pages as the staples will not be flat against both sides of the paper."
1,Disappointing!,"Deceptively, the description claims that this stapler comes with 5,000 high capacity staples included, BUT in reality, only 500 are included. SHAME ON YOU!Caveat Emptor!!!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
5,BIG step above the average desktop stapler,Got this for work reports that average 25-30 pages. Just got too frustrating trying to use a regular stapler. This just punches through stacks of paper from 20-55 pages with hardly any effort at all. Have not had a jam or a single wasted staple. Use the correct staples for this model and you won't ever want to go back to the weak average desktop stapler when you have more than 15 pages to put together. A bit larger than the average stapler but not too much heavier.
5,Great Medium size stapler!,I love this stapler for those in-between jobs. I actually bought a few for co-workers so they would stop coming over to borrow mine!
3,trying a new product.. had a whole in the tube which now dries out the stuff inside.,.. came quickly and timely with my schedule... however there was damage to bottle which caused the inside to dry quicker than usual
4,A good all-round performer with nice looks!,"A knife with a look that is pleasing to the eye combined with the toughness and edge-holding ability of BG42 steel. Mine was purchased from a knife dealer in the UK as importing goods from the US can be quite [costly] for the private collector. Nice Hybrid Leather/Kydex sheath, which would benefit from the addition of a retention strap as, in time, the leather will stretch and the friction fit would not be so reliable. Handle is extremely ergonomic although the thumb notches on the blade are somewhat aggressive for my tastes. Choil is just about perfect for detailed work. I would have given this four-and-a-half stars if possible, although unable to give five as my Fallkniven F1 just beats this model with its slightly superior VG10 performance. Value for money? Extremely good (73 in the UK) as I believe that the manufacturer gives a limited lifetime warranty."
2,Watch out for mistakes.,"There are mistakes in this book. On page 34 the author refers to the ""nucleus"" of an electron??? What?? The lewis dot structure for calcium isn't Ca . it's Ca.. The writing is also somewhat pedantic. The language of Chemistry is confusing enough; straight talk with attention to detail is best."
2,Difficult to follow,"I purchased this book as a Chemistry review for an entrance exam. It has been many years since I've taken Chemistry and needed a quick refresher so I could pass this section on my test. I find the book very hard to follow, and does not explain formula calculations as in depth as I would expect. There are many times where I catch myself staring at the problem solution and have to back track to understand how they came up with their answer. The definitions are over-worded and hard to understand. I've had to get online and look up definitions for the laws over and over again because the way they word them, they just don't make sense. Maybe I am under-qualified for this book, but I would think a review book should be broken down in an easier format. I wouldn't waste your time on this book."
1,Full of errors; poorly presented.,"Don't waste your money. I have the Super Reviews on Chemistry and Physics; both are wrought with error and have a format that is difficult to follow. They appear to be cranked out by some sort of word processor ill-fitted to professional publishing. My suggestion is to go with Cliffs Notes or the ""Teach Yourself Books"" series."
4,works and the price is right,Super sharp out of the box. It's the right size for processing game and you won't be out too much if you lose it in the woods. The handle may get a little slick when wet but most do.
5,Great Knife,"Great knife. Very sharp and the perfect size for me. The sheath is OK but their Kydex one should be better. If you are going to really badly abuse the grip area (beating on rocks or something), you might want to go to another knife style but for most people, this a great knife."
4,"Nice feel, lite weight.","For the price, this is a great, sharp, light weight knife. And, I think the sheath is just fine. It ships with the rectangular cordura sheath (pictured) that has a stone pocket. I believe the kydex is an available option. The cordura model has got a lot of options for mounting.The blade feels good in the hand...balanced.For the dollar, I like it a lot."
5,Excelent,"This is the best knife i could never ask for, it's so sharp and durable, i sharp it like 4 months ago and it's steel very very sharp."
4,Decent Made in China knife,"I bought this knife for a cousin who served in Iraq and loves SOG knives. I paid around 40 bucks after shipping. I opted for the better stainless steel because this guy is hard on carbon knives. However, I only gave it 4 stars because it's made in China. I would have gladly paid twice that for an american product. The steel is as hard as a coffin nail, so he should have a blast in that department. Not a problem if you're patient. The handle has a great feel. The sheath was impressive. It locks up tight and has a velcro button snap. This way vertical carry is no problem. It also has a velcro pocket on the front, where he will not doubt carry another folder knife or very small fire and tinder kit. Overall, decent purchase."
5,graficos excelentes y precio bajisimo,"no se puede pedir mas por una placa que vale menos de la mitad en comparacion a las nvidia, etc."
1,No only is book bad so is class,I took the class taught by author and the class is not any better. We proofed his draft version of book and there was more red ink than there was printed material. Not surprised by book quality.
5,Only the intelligent will get it. it was very helpful,I read the book it was very helpful and organized it explained things very clearly and was useful in classes.
5,LOVE IT!,"I so love the game Nertz!!!! My German grandmother played this game with me for years during my childhood. I found out later that Ligretto is an Italian version of the same game, which makes me happy too, because I am Italian and German. I have played the Ligretto version as well, and I love both. They are the same, but the cards are slightly different. I'm so happy to have found it called NERTZ given that was the name I knew it as a kid. You will love it. I'm just saying."
1,Several cards missing,We purchased this game for Christmas. Just pulled it out to play with the kids. It was kind of confusing and really slow. The problem was there are six cards missing from the deck and two cards are duplicates. Really hard to play a game with missing cards. Now I will just throw it away because it is worthless.
1,Unhappy with the vendor,"First let me say my family absolutely loves this game so we were very excited when it came in the mail. Unfortunately, there were two cards missing from the game, so it was useless. I contacted the vendor to let them know and request a refund. They did not even have the curtesy to respond. It has now been three weeks and i haven't heard a peep. I will never purchase from this vendor again and hope amazon looks closer at them before selling their products."
3,Muki - Cabin Fever,"Muki's first album, CABIN FEVER, brings back memories of the good ol' days of future jazz, when all things were possible. Ok, so it wasn't that long ago. From the house beats and wild acid lines of ""Jahbar"" to the lazy vibes on ""Ki Juice,"" there's an unmistakable niceness here. The use of samples from quasi-Indian spiritual guides and the movie 2001 are a bit gratuitious, but the mellow ""Esc."" quickly allays any fears. Muki's willingness to switch up things mid-song (like the funk bass that comes in on ""Nite Lite"") keeps things from getting too banal. The plucked notes and ethnic flavor of ""Shine"" presages the marimbas and wobbly synth lines. ""Concord"" ends the album with a more stripped-down sound, less layered than the others for a completely different feel, with small builds and swells over its nine-minute length. Overall, while the album is not superlative, it's still a fine debut effort."
1,Perhaps for someone else.,"I have two major points of dissatisfaction, first I found the book lacking in information. Secondly I have some problems with the layout and format: 1.) There is no index, so if you want to go to a site, say, to find topaz, you have to flip through the whole book. 2.) Secondly, the book consists of confusing maps of two, three or maybe even only one line with ""to Clarendon"" on one end and ""to Matador"" on the other end; I'm supposed to be able to picture this within the State by referring to the small inset map of Texas with two crossing geology hammers: alas the hammers are by scale so large that I can't understand what's going on. There are no large maps of areas of petrified wood, topaz or agate; instead there are 75 listed sites within the State of Texas with headings: ""Cisco fossils,"" ""Toyah Agate,"" ""Frio River Wood."" Some of the sites in the book are areas where rock collecting is prohibited. I find little to recommend. Sorry."
2,poor quality,"I bought this for my son, who was just over 2 years old at the time. Within about 9 or 10 months, the railing broke at the plastic hinge. Obviously, since this is major stress point for the product, it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue. I was disappointed that this railing did not last longer."
2,2 Strikes,"I was initially very happy with this product. We purchased it to transition our 2-year-old to a double bed. However, the plastic hinge bracket broke after several months of use. Since I liked the product, I thought maybe I didn't have it adjusted correctly and bought a second one. It, too, broke; so I'm now looking for a sturdier alternative."
5,Works fine,works well - easy to put together and use. Started using them when my son was 2 years and refused to sleep in crib. I use them on a twin size bed and double bed and they adjust easily - Good buy.
4,A delightful book for toddlers.,"This book is fun to read and leaves lots of opportunity for discussion while reading. The illustrations are great. Best of all, even with a toddler's propensity to request that I read the book over and over and over again, I don't tire of this one."
5,Great easy book,"This book is awesome! My son looks at it every day. He's three and he's liked it since he was one. We borrowed it from the library first, but soon realized we'd have to buy him a copy of his own."
5,Enjoyed this book,This book has believable characters and a good story line. It kept me interested and I recommend it to any mystery fan.
3,Aberdeen's Jack Frost,"This book disappointed me after a promising start. Macbride writes well about Aberdeen. But he seems to fall into an imitation of Wingfield's Frost books, with fairly similar characters, including his protagonist Logan Macrae, and a very similar plot structure (multiple story lines, many with predictable outcomes). There was no real edge to this novel--as if Macbride couldn't decide if he was writing a satiric-comic story or a serious police procedural."
1,Too much candy and rain,"There was a plot running through all this, but it went off in so many directions, it was difficult to follow. And running like an irritating itch through it all was the constant, unending, repetitive description of the rain, rain, rain, ad nauseum, along with one other thing. the author could not bring Inspector Insch into the story at any point without telling about him eating candy. I challenge the reader to find a single moment when Insch enters the story without a reference to him reaching into his pocket and eating one of any number of kinds of candy. Enough, already."
4,Very good procedural.,"I am an admitted fan of police procedurals, and this was a good one. I particularly liked that McRae wasn't an angst-ridden, alcohol-driven character--although McRae did his fair share of imbibing-whose relationship to his fellow officers and superiors is realistic. The subject matter is difficult; anytime children are involved, it's hard to read. The story was well plotted, with interesting twists and turns and good suspense. I even enjoyed the bit of a nod to Ian Rankin. Altogether, I enjoyed it and look forward to the next MacBride."
3,Enjoyable enough,"As a big fan of the Rebus series and a lover of Scotland, I was looking forward to a new series of books in this genre. If you are squeamish, then this may not be the book for you. The plot revolves around investigations into the deaths of several young children and has a couple of particularly nasty story lines that do not make for pleasant reading. On the other hand, the banter between the main characters and the evocation of Aberdeen were highly enjoyable (the reviewer who complained about the frequent allusions to sweets and rain has not, I'm guessing, ever been to North-East Scotland). I will read the next book in the series and am hoping that the author does not feel the need to be overly creative about the murder scenarios. If you have read any Mo Hayder, you will know what I'm talking about."
3,Strong begining but weak middle,"When it comes to describing the physical setting (a wet city in North Scotland perched on the North Sea), the author does a great job. This certainly adds to the atmosphere (as it would in a movie)and elements of the police procedural (investigation techniques and so on) are well-covered. But, in a thriller, when a plot gets long and there are a number of story lines (as well as romantic diversions of the protagonist), there is a risk of tedium setting in- as happened to this reviewer."
4,"Gritty, Fun","Finally found a new author that suits my tastes. The main character is flawed yet likeable as are the others, great bit of suspense on the ""Lady Killer"", D.I. Steele!An unpleasant subject that was well written and easy to read.I believe Rebus and Inspector Grace fans would also find this author comparable."
1,Playschool Drill - needs battery !,"Drill good for domestic power. Battery and charger need constant supervision. Baby sitting this tool is required for multiple usage. Paper weights, door stops, collection of expensive hazardous waste. Other uses for dead skil batteries inflicted upon buyers. Very old product. You (stil) can buy these batteries. I wonder do Bosch drills blow this bad. Parent company to Playschool 18volt 3/8 drill/ driver toy. Third time will not be the charm. Stay away from Skill and Bosch Ni Cad batteries."
1,Seven Treasures Publications NEEDS a new Editor,"Terrible editing. Printed in the USA? Wittgenstein himself could have done a better job of translation and grammar correction. Poor quality. This is a piece of LITERATURE, not an article. GET IT RIGHT!!"
1,"Review for the version, not the book","I haven't yet fully read the Tractatus (I got through the fourth proposition before I gave up last time), so I'm not reviewing the book itself. However, I did just buy this version of it, and should warn you all against making my mistake. This version (the Seven Treasures Publishing version):- is horribly bound in such a way that it is(a) guaranteed to fall apart swiftly, perhaps before you even finish the book(b) incredibly aesthetically displeasing- has at least one very obvious formatting error, which I found in 30 seconds of flipping through the book (it's on proposition 6)- doesn't cite the translatorBy all means read the book, but don't get this version. My friend who adores Wittgenstein recommends the Routledge version (with the brick cover)."
1,Worst editing in history,"Do not buy this edition! The editing is so bad that there are blatant typos in nearly every entry of Wittgenstein's text. There are no notes by an editor or translator, so the reader has no idea who is responsible for this ridiculous butchery of the text. I'm talking about the most basic proofreading here, not about interpretations of the text (I don't read German, so I can't comment about that). For example: "" If they world had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense would depend on whether another proposition was true (2.0211)."" They world? ""It is obvious that an imagined world, however difference it may be from the real one . . .(2.022)"" -- this kind of thing can't help but distract the reader from the meaning. These are just 2 of scores of examples. Those were on the same page, and you find them on every page. 7 Treasures Publications seems to be some kind of fly-by-night garage publisher; this is the crudest, most unprofessional publication I've ever seen."
1,Typos Are Inexcusable,"As others here have said, this edition contains numerous typographical errors. Such a level of care is unworthy of the text, and unworthy of the reader to whom the text is addressed.If you purchase this book, it will come with a date stamped on the back page; this date will read as no more than a few days from when you made your purchase. In other words, this is a distributor's edition. Its base text is copied inexpertly and in marked contrast to the efficiency of your personal copies' printing and delivery.Buy this if you want to give an incompetent business whose priority is not the integrity of its product some of your money. But if you want to read the text, look for another edition."
3,Kindle Version has quite a few errors,"Just wanted to warn you all that the free Kindle version of this text has quite a few scanning errors in it that were not caught by an editor. If this especially annoys you, you might want a paid version.As for the actual work in question...it's not my cup of tea."
5,Not a book to be read,"This is a very strange book. It is also very beautiful. Logic, ethics, and everything spanned by these two subjects is covered.But the book itself isn't important. See the penultimate proposition: all the previous propositions are nonsense--a ""ladder"" intended to help you ""climb out of the hole"" of philosophical misunderstanding. Once this is done the ladder can be thrown away. (I recommend keeping your copy, just in case you fall in the hole again).The final proposition, therefore the only nonsensical one, is Proposition 7: Whereof one cannot speak, one must be silent."
2,a dead philosophy,"I am a bit surprised at the positive reviews of this book. Obviously, it has a strong historical importance and as such it should be recognized. But it is a stupid, dead philosophy, as Wittgenstein himself later realized. Now, don't get me wrong, there are details (like stipulation), perhaps many details, that Wittgenstein held onto, but the whole was thrown away and considered ""blind."" Thus, when I see reviewers having positive things to say about the big picture (A pun!) of early Wittgenstein, I can't help but think they are very confused or ignorent of the larger whole of Wittgenstein's authorship.Thus, I will say this is an important book. But it is a stepping stone to the later Wittgenstein which is much better philosophy and (heaven forbid!) even phenomenology. Do not just read this book and think it is right. Please read Wittgenstein's own deconstruction of the Tractatus, I mean the Philosophical Investigations."
3,A bit slow,"I was hoping for a more exciting denouement, and I must say I did not find the main character compelling.I recommend ""The South Beach Diet."""
5,essential reading,"it's clear, concise and absolutely logical. i wish every philosophy book were like this.there was a part, though, about formal logic, that was a little difficult.."
5,Great Storage System,"The Hyloft is perfect for us, as we have a high ceiling in the garage and lots of things we want to save. I ordered 2 systems thru Amazon and initially tried to install them. I watched the video yet found the studs to be very difficult to locate.Via the Hyloft website, I found a local operation to install them. The company, however, needs to make money as well and required me to have at least 4 units to install versus the 2 I bought here. I completely understood, especially given the drive time and fuel costs.The Hyloft system itself is a great way to expand your storage and provide an archival system for things you just can't throw away.I'm very happy I worked through an expert company who installs these daily. It took them less than 2 hours to install 4. They had to drill thru steel to access the wood stud, which was even hard for them. They Hylofts are now perfectly aligned along the ceiling which looks very clean. The extra cost was well worth it."
5,Sensory fun,"Our 8-year-old son with autism loves this tape. We have checked it out of the library several times at his request. We are now buying it because he likes it so much. He gets into the artful tapes of trucks driving down the road, mechanics changing truck tires, truck sounds and the funky musical score. The lack of narration makes it easier for him to experience the pace and images this tape provides. He is easily overwhlemed by too much informatin, especially verbal information, and this tape is very soothing for him."
3,"It's 30 minutes of ""18-wheelers"" with no narration.","It is a wonderful ""second"" truck video. It's a 30-minute montage of ""18-wheelers"" with minimal music and no narration. Our son loves it, but I wouldn't call it educational in terms of learning about different types of trucks."
5,Awesome Club: Awesome Compilation,Awesome Club on the coast of Spain and an awesome compilatiion of pure dance songs for real clubbers. A must have for 1999 memories.
3,cool book,"Dragons Milk is a cool book because,its fun to read interesting, and exsiting book i have ever read.dragons milk is about a girl that needs dragons milk from a powerful dragon to cure a sickness that her friend has.the main charecter is Kaeldra she is blonde,young and has green eyes like a dragon slayer."
3,just an ok book,This is not the best book that I have read but it's also not the worst but then again I'm very pickey about the books that i've read.I recommend this book to ages 11 and younger.
5,Meet dragons from the comfort of your own home!,"This book is so wonderfly written you practicly jump in Kaeldra's world! An excellent piece of work, if I do say so myself, and I do!"
5,"If you haven't read it, you need to!!","I first heard about the prequall to this book, called 'Flight Of The Dragon Kyn' from a friend on the internet. A year later, I found this book in my school library, and, assuming that it was the book that I'd heard about, I checked it out. I LOVE this book! It's so vivid, I can imagine that I am watching it happen. One thing, though. The copy of the book that I read has a different cover than the one that's on this page. It shows a scene in the book where Fiora, a dragon, is telling Kaeldra(the main charecter) to get away from her draclings. Anyone know why that is?"
2,Disappointing,"This was recommended to me as being similar to books by Patricia Wrede and Tamora Pierce, but it lacked the humor, character development, and enjoyable cast of characters those two authors provide."
5,A Book of Dragons,"This is a great book about a girl named Kaeldra who is faced with the quest to save some Draclings from those who would kill them. She is also being hunted, having the ability to speak to Dragons. I found this book to be wonderfully written. It's inspired my own stories about Dragons since I've read it at age 10!"
3,Pleasantly entertaining fare for early teens,"..., there are other fantasy writers with a better knack for character development. The plot is satisfying enough; a young girl with a conscience tries to help a trio of young dragons to the safety provided by a sort of underground ""dragon conservation movement."" The dragonlore the author invents is captivating and plausible, providing the characters of her world innumerable reasons for dragonslaying. However, practically everyone the main character encounters is against her, from the mildly ""wicked stepmother"" type character to the wicked apothecary to the evil King to the wicked fashion-designer... And the overnight reformation of a would-be-dragonslayer was quite unbelievable. And after a tyme, the over-use of the letter y in practically every syngle name became more than myldly annoying, yf you catch my dryft...."
1,Upset about order!,"I ordered this adapter 2 times, and got an item entirely different than what is picture. I was angry because it cost 73 dollars each time. Finally I got tired, and went to the store to buy it... got it for the same price, only plus tax. $79 :( I would not recommend buying this product."
3,required reading,"This book was required Reading in 7th grade for me. (ACE schools) I like this book while its written as if the writer was there, it still gives a good look and D.L.'s life"
1,bRIEF REVIEW D.L. MOODY THE GREATEST EVANGELIST OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY,The author writes what she apparently imagines was the real dialogue spoken by Mr. Moody and other people as conversation. I did not want a mini novel.I would like to have known this prior to purchase.
1,FRAUD,THIS IS NOT A COBALT SET OF DRILLS!! This is a High Speed Steel set of hex shank drill bits that are cobalt coated. The drills are also made in China. I have never bought a single cobalt drill made in China. I buy higher quality cobalt drills made in The US. Amazon should withdraw or change the description of this listing.
1,don't bother. bits break and strip themselves from their housing.,"too much torque and the bit break, or are striped from their housing. I recommend spending the extra $$ to get more durable bits."
3,HEX SHANK Quick-Change COBALT Drill Bit Set,"Despite the manufacturers name (Neiko Tools USA), this set is made in China. It is of reasonable quality given the price, but in my opinion is definately not a ""Professional Grade"" 29-piece set, which typically sells for four times the price of this set. Perhaps OK for the occassional user, but will frustrate anyone expecting superior performance and/or durability."
4,"Take a look at the story, do you see yourself?","Carl Hiaasen has brought the absurdest style to life in this wonderful tale. The purpose of such a style is to bring forth a view by magnifying it so much, the subject matter becomes a caricature of itself. ""Sick Puppy"" does this in a delightful way. Who else would come up with the idea of two ""Barbie"" models hooked on rhinoceros horn? Or the hit man who gets his jollies from listening to recordings of 911 tapes?Woven through the book, Boodle provides a view that is above it all by doing what dogs do best - being themselves. He doesn't care what his name is, or who is around, or where he is. Everything is an opportunity to explore new smells, maybe find some food, or chase another animal.The book is rich with characters; human, canine, toad, and rhinoceros."
1,Needs an editor,"Admittedly funny for about 50 pages, I was ready to throw the damn thing out the window by page 200. Just went on and on and on and on ad nauseum. For those who prefer to not have to think."
2,Sick Puppy,"I have been a fan of Hiaasen for some time now. Sorry to say his writing has been a disappointament lately & is far below his classics like Strip Tease, Tourist Season or Skin Tight. Sick Puppy didn't even bring a smile to my face. The story feels forced & the language is overdone without any natural humor. To tell you the truth I did not finish this book."
2,Same Old Puppy,"Carl Hiaasen must be pumping this stuff out too fast. The jokes are wearing thin. Yeah so Miami is a real bizarre place. Anyone could tell you that. If you expect more insight, you won't get it here. ""Stormy Weather"" and ""Tourist Season"", his best efforts, offered some pretty good chuckles, but Hiassen has never taken it anywhere since. By this stage of the game, it looks like he isn't going to."
2,Not Hiaasen's best,"Unlike his earlier (and better) works, political commentary dominates ""Sick Puppy."" If you are a member of the Green Party, you might enjoy it more, but for everyone else, it is a bit too much."
2,thin characters,"Verry thin characters in this book. Everyone is painted as all good or all bad, while in life this is not true. Not only are the characters thin but it seems that everyone was developed from a single childhood experience."
2,Sick Puppy,"This book is far too long and too repetitive in dialogue (513 pages in paper back). I started to ""scan"" about half way through. I enjoy reading Carl Hiaasen, but not this much at one time."
2,"Slow, boring read","This was my first Hiassen book. I could barely get through it. The whole first half was strung out & tedious. The characters are beyond quirky-they are unbelievable. I felt more like I was reading an novel based on the Dukes of Hazzard with the obvious bumbling villians and the protagonists developing plots to outwit them.Before I count out Hiassen completely, I'm going to read Skinny Dip. Maybe his writing style just isn't for me."
1,It's a Real Dog,"I've read many of Hiaasen's other novels, but this one is just too tedious, repetitive, and over the top. Gets boring half way through and it was a real struggle to finish--I suggest you don't step in it."
5,A must read!!,Fabulous book that really makes you think about your actions on the environment and how government works. A real eye opening book for fiction.
4,"Eco-Terrorists, Litterbugs, Hit Men and Labradors","It's a mixed blessing that we can refer to a ""typical"" Carl Hiaasen novel. ""Sick Puppy"" is one--it has the mix we're used to of dumb politicians, greasy lobbyists, skanky hit men, the ever-resourceful ""Skink"" and some plot devices to keep all these folks in conflict with each other (in this case, an evironmentally aware trust-fund millionaire, a lobbyist's highly conflicted wife and her black Labrador). This was an enjoyable book, but not one of his very best. At over 500 pages, it could have done with one or two fewer plot wiggles to keep the legendary Hiaasen astringency intact. Still, Hiaasen fans will enjoy it."
3,fast paced and strangely good!,"This was the first Hiaasen novel I have read, and it was not at all what I had expected. I thought it would be good, but never imagined a story involving an eco-terrorist, a real estate developer with a Barbie fetish, a hit man whose hobby is listening to 911 calls on tape, an ex-car salesman turned Florida governor, a political lobbyist with a passion for Republicans, a confused young wife of the lobbyist abd a former governor of Florida named Skink who refuses to compromise his beliefs and a sick Lab puppy that you just have to love. Carl Hiaasen is the only author capable of wrapping a leash around all these people and taking a brisk walk successfully."
4,Laugh your way through an amazig tale,"Carl Hiaasen is the perfect antidote to stress, particularly the stress of living in Florida with its myriad changes. When the frustrations of living through the tourist season, the changeable weather, the burgeoning building boom, and life in the topics gets too much, then it is time to read Carl Hiassen. He has a talent for spotlighing the absurd and makes all the problems then seem much less aggravating. The best part of reading any of his books though is that he knows his craft. This is a good read."
3,Not up to usual standards!,"I've always liked the crazy, mixed-up, slightly bent characters in Hiaasen's books, but this one left me wanting.In this book, however, there wasn't enough insight into any of the characters (save the lobbyist's wife) to make me care what happened to them or to understand why they did what they did.Hiaasen has a good handle on the corrupt nature of politics...I just think he missed the boat a bit with this effort.I'll still read his books."
4,Carl has a decent book with this one,"Carl Hiaasen's books always have an underlying, bleeding-heart liberal aspect about them. Even so, I love the way he writes. Carl has a gift for character development that's just off-the-mark enough to be recognizable and entertaining.A few of us wish we could get away with the actions detailed in the book, which is part of what makes reading ""Sick Puppy"" fun. Imagine seeing someone on the road throwing their trash out the window. What about that pompous fool in the restaurant blowing smoke from his over-priced cigar? Wouldn't you just like to give them a message? Now imagine you're a millionaire with nothing else to do. I guess that's how Carl came up with this book."
2,A disappointing effort,"Sick Puppy has all the elements of a classic Carl Hiaasennovel: a slightly off-kilter love story unfolding in the midst of anexplosive mix of sleazoid exploiters, deranged eco-defenders, and corrupt government officials. That said, however, it lacks the one element that sets Hiaasen's other (and better) novels apart from others in this genre--Sick Puppy simply wasn't funny. Whereas Hiaasen's trenchant wit normally breathes life and side-splitting humor into his stories, this one remained flat and predictably formulaic, not to mention overly drawn out. Hiaasen obviously was reaching when the dog became the main character in the middle of the book.We've read every one of his books and eagerly await the arrival of each new one. We hate to say it, but if we had it to do over again, we'd borrow the paperback copy of Sick Puppy from someone rather than buying the hardcover. Better yet, we would reread a funny Hiassen book such as Double Whammy, Skin Tight, or Lucky You."
5,Sweeeeeeeeet!,"My first Hiaasen book, ""Sick Puppy"" contains some wonderfully over-the-top characters! This book marked my re-interest in mystery/suspense books by showing me that they have come a long way in the past years."
5,Classic Hiaasen,"This is typical Carl Hiaasen: there is the cast of Florida crazies, the corrupt politicians, the greedy developers and finally, the eco-terrorists. All of these ingredients are deftly mixed together to create a highly amusing novel, with a serious foundation: the destruction of Florida's natural beauty in order to line the pockets of the developers and the politicians.If you have read any of Hiaasen's other books, none of this will come as a great surprise, and this is reinforced by the reappearance of the characters of Skink and Jim Tile. The dialogue is very well written and realistic, though the situations the characters find themselves in aren't quite as realistic: which is what makes his books so funny.This book is great entertainment with a serious side: it will make you laugh and at the same time make you reconsider that organized canoe trip through the mangroves in the Everglades."
4,"Developers, lobbyists........and other greedy low-lifes","Another hilarious peek into the mass-paving of Florida by Hiaasen. This time Hiaasen griefs on lobbyists, pols, land developers, ""big-game"" hunters, and gold-digging wannabe's. The centerpiece of this one is Twilly Spree, a trust-fund eco-terrorist who targets a self-important litterbug state lobbyist. Before Hiaasen puts a wrap on this far-fetched tale, he manages to lay waste to the seemy world of backroom political favoritism & greedy resort development. Skink, the former governor of Florida and current hermit/ecological antagonist/road-kill connoisseur, plays a large role again. Get ready to laugh out loud."
4,Not his best,"Hiaason does it again in this book - and while it is not the best of his work (Stormy Weather is my favorite,) I try to live by: any hiaason is better than none. :) It has some hilarious situations which is always what makes him the master. However, I don't think he should've written from the dogs point of view (which he does here in a couple of chapters.)"
4,Twilly Spree is no Hayduke,"Twilly Spree is no Hayduke-- he is not the primeval he-man who hunts for survival, satirized instead in the former governor Clinton Tyree, which Hiaasen uses to wink at Abbey. Twilly is a disturbed, post-modern, spoiled brat with a penchant for pranks. A man with no subconscious that becomes the ideal subconcious of the reader. Hiaasen introduces the great casts of characters, but for most of the novel doesn't seem to know what to do with them. Parts of this novel are hilariously funny, and yet some others read like unedited, hurried up stuff. It's a pity, as Hiaasen's satiric look at pork-barrel politics and developers' greed is unrivaled in contemporary fiction. Cut a hundred pages or two (I picked up the paperback, your mileage might vary) and we could have something really funny, and thought provocative too: a rare and precious combination."
5,"Again, as always, a pleasure","Carl Hiaasen again writes a save the environment, good guys win, wonderfully funny novel. If you're familiar with his work, here is another fun and funny adventure and while the formula is the same, the story is not tiring. If this is your first time...read away and enjoy! It's hard to put down."
4,Sick Puppy Indeed,"Ah, the joy of a new Hiaasen! Very few authors can make me laugh out loud while reading, but he can. This adventure into the absurd takes us into the world of lobbiests, illegal hunting, illegal construction practices, and of course, eco-terrorism.As unscrupulous politicians try to take a beautiful key and turn it into high dollar homes it is up to Twilly and Skink to prevent the dastardly deed from happening.One can only hope there will be further adventures of Skink and Twilly!"
3,"a fast read, but not up to speed","Carl Hiassen is a master of the quirky character. In his early novels, those characters were integral to the plot and breathed life into the fiction. Regrettably, in Sick Puppy, I often felt the tales of oddballs were devices used to expand a thin plotline in order to meet the page quota. While amusing, they did not provide strong subplots, and were occasionally annoying. Too many popular writers peter out when forced to meet publishers' tough contractual timeframes. I hope this doesn't happen to Hiassen because I enjoy his energy, his take on FL politics, and believe he has a message that can be delivered, convincingly & entertainingly, in a fictional format. As for SP, I wish I'd waited til it came out in paperback, or was available at the library."
2,Tired Puppy,"Hiaasen keeps writing the same book over and over. It started out as a laugh-out-loud, wildly entertaining read, but has grown stale with repetition. Sick Puppy offers some vintage Hiaasen lines, but if you've read the others, you won't find anything new here."
3,competent product from the Hiaasen factory...,"No doubt about it. Carl Hiaasen can produce some wickedly funny fiction. Some of his one-liners, although frequently quite rude, are hilarious. And some of his characterizations and story lines, such as in his 'Strip Tease' and 'Skin Tight', are very well-crafted indeed. But sadly, too often Hiaasen seems to recycle characters and plots ... as with Sick Puppy.'Sick Puppy' is much like Hiaasen's 'Native Tongue', 'Tourist Season', and 'Double Whammy'. In fact, all three seem like identical clones. The stories involve corrupt politicians and businessmen who willfully or negligently trash the Florida ecosystem, with eco-warriors (including Hiaasen's favorite: Skink, an ex-Florida governor) battling to save the day. Yes, all funny enough. But I get the sense Hiaasen has either gotten lazy or is suffering from writer's block. Will he ever return to the form he had when he wrote the brilliant 'Skin Tight'?Bottom line: competent, funny ... but very deja vu."
2,"It's funny, but we've heard it before","Reading Sick Puppy was kind of like seeing one of the many Pink Panther Movies again. I chuckled and smiled thru the whole thing but there was not really one original concept or character in the whole book. The same thick irony and poetic justice visits the characters in the same old way that it has in the last several books. I hope that Carl Hiaasen is capable of something besides the old ""I hate Florida developers and Disney"". He is a talented writer that seems to have fallen into the old trap of trying to fulfill a contract to produce a book when he has a deadline instead of an inspiration."
3,Double Whammy and Skin Tight are still the best.,"This book was Hiassen at his mediocre - better that Lucky You but not up to Skin Tight or Double Whammy. Usually, his books have several inspired moments, but this one had only one, the rhino rampage."
3,This One's a Letdown,"Sorry to disagree with so many other readers, but I thought Hiaasen ran out of gas on this one. This time out, the characters were less well-drawn and far less credible. Suspending disbelief required lots more effort than usual. Here's hoping the author returns to his original form next time out."
4,Sick Puppy - Sick World,fun little read about the desecration of Florida and the sick world we live in. Funny good read by a wonderful author!
4,Pristine Florida?,"Carl Hiaason has got his writting style back. Outrages and funny at times. The charcaters are colorful and memorable. Even the labador, Boodle. In Sick Puppy we have a an eco-terrorist that has a compulsive drive to make sure that any one that he happens to witness harming the environment, learns the error of their ways.Our eco-terrorist, Twilly Spree, happens to be driving behind Palmer Stoat, a state lobbyist, when Palmer throws his trash out the window of his Range Rover. This starts Twilly on a crusade to teach Palmer the error of his ways. While trying to teach Palmer lesson after lesson, Twilliy uncovers that littering is just one of Palmer's destructive habits.This is a traditional Hiaason book with an imaginative ending. If you have a dark sense of humor, pick this book up."
3,"Funny, but a letdown","I picked this book up because I loved Basket Case. This one, however, didn't measure up. It is funny--which is why I'm giving it 3 stars--but after a while, the preachiness got to me. As other reviewers have pointed out, any character who's making money is through-and-through bad, while anyone who's not (even if they have plenty of it from the efforts of their fathers/spouses) is well-rounded and good. What also hindered my enjoyment is that I didn't in the least like any of the characters; I actively disliked most of them."
4,Enter the twisted mind of an environmentalist,"This book is a must for every revengeful environmentalist. It is filled with the evil deeds of politicians and lobbyists and a very environmentally conscious main character who fights back for mother earth, then goes overboard into what some may consider the realm of the psychopath. There are so many plot twists and turns and new, interesting characters popping up throughout the story that it keeps you reading, despite the fact that it is encroaching upon a very predictable ending. So if you have time on your hands, and you are [ticked] off at that litterbug in the car in front of you on the highway, take a while to read this book."
3,Sick Puppy,"Carl Hiaasen remains one of my favorite authors, but Sick Puppy was not as strong a performance as Lucky. The story line while up to Hiassen standards for content lacked the bizarre twists and turns that I believe set him apart. The reacquantance with the former governor was a nice touch, but our new hero was a too much like the former governor to meet the standards set in prior books for new characters. Finally, the bad guys needed a special touch to make them memoriable although the death scene with its grand composite of events was almost as good as the ending of Lucky. My strongest feeling was that I expected too much from this book and as a result have a slight sense of let down, however it was an enjoyable read and I have passed in on to other fans in my neighborhood."
3,SICK PUPPY,A fun read but not outstanding. Not as funny as I was lead to believe it would be. But ok.
4,"Quirky, hilarious, and not far from the truth when it comes to political sick puppies!","This isn't usually a book I would read, but am so glad I did. An hilarious tale that snowballed from the simple and mindless act of throwing a wrapper from a car window. The wrapper kept on rolling, picking up every trashy element of society with it. Rich, bursting at the seams characters are weaved seamlessly into juicy entwined story lines. I only wish book alike this were ready for iPad."
2,not his best,I love Carl Hiaasen but this book was pretty weak . It took me forever to warm to the main characters especially Twilly. Every character was just a little too over the top as was the plot. Try Basket Case if you want the best of Carl Hiaasen.
4,Hilarious!,I could not stop laughing. Hiassen is a great satirest. And his characters are beyond funny!
4,A delicious morality tale.,"This is a great read: justice is done so wonderfully and hysterically, whether it be via heavy machinery or removed eyeballs. And who else but Hiaasen can narrate from a dog's perspective so accurately? Can't wait for the next one."
4,Not quite up to a very high standard,"Is he starting to slip? I read ""Sick Puppy"" with great enjoyment, but it wasn't the absolute gas that ""Stormy Weather"" and ""Lucky You"" were. For one thing, the villains in this book were not as equisitely dumb-and-violent as Bode, Chub and Shiner in ""Lucky You"". For another thing, Skink came out of his woods in this one, and for me, at least, it didn't really work -- can you really suppose for one minute that a man who was once governor and then disappeared completely would be able to enter the governor's residence completely unnoticed, even if he had changed a whole, whole lot? And finally, the story didn't roar along at quite the same pace as I've come to expect from Carl Hiaasen's books. Again -- I read it with pleasure, and I will pre-order the next one as soon as it comes up on Amazon, but ..."
4,Funny Puppy,"This is a very funny novel. There's alot of weird charcaters, but I still liked many of them. I just started reading Carl Hiassen over the summer and I'm hooked on him. You won't be bored with this novel. Now I want to go to Florida."
2,*shoulder shrug*,Eh. So-so. It's a shame to see the character of Skink reduced to a cardboard cutout of his former self. It may be time for a different formula. The author has ridden this one to death.
1,Same old crop of baddies...,"same old formulaic mess. Hiaasen uses the stock plot of just about every novelist in the current stable. Keen disappointments abound. Trust me, you can wait for the paperback to confirm what I'm saying here."
1,Sick Puppy: a nauseating read,"A miserable read! Thought he was kidding with the enviro-nut spin in the 1st 10 pages, but it kept getting worse. The celebrated characters are criminals, and the romantic interlopers are a pair composed of an unbathed deadbeat living off inheritance (obviously wouldn't understand economics) and a cheating wife (who also had not clue about economics).More nauseating than the most left-wing paraphernalia you can buy in the free world (but maybe you could get worse in Cuba or China; maybe France).I can read a book every 1 - 2 nights, but it's been over a week and I can't finish this piece of rot. Rare that I put a book down without finishing, but I've had pushishment enough already.MISERABLE!"
4,Chris's Amazing Cholureefindalurench,"Sick Puppy is a super book. It is a story with an insane plot about a man trying to prevent someone from littering. The man has to catch the litterbug before he litters some more. I like this book because it ahs so much action and differenty things are always happening. However, I think that the characters are a little bit too unrealistic. This book is different from other books because this book has an incredible plot and characters with extreme characteristics."
4,you gotta stay awake for this one o_O,"dont get discouraged by the seemingly never-ending list of characters, you'll get to know them apart as you read. i guess the best word to describe this book is - twisted. it follows quite a few different people and tells the story of the same events from each of their points of view. confused? yeh. but surprisingly enough, the book does forge ahead. i found myself making dog-ears of the pages with funny little quips so i could repeat them to my friends. i wasn't disappointed and im thinking of exploring carl hiaasen some more."
3,A letdown?,"Carl Hiaason is one of the few writers that can make me laugh out loud with their writings. I count down the days until his books are released. The characters and the plots are outrageous. In SICK PUPPY, I cheered everytime Twilly Spree was devising his plots of destruction against the litterbugs of Florida. However, I made the mistake of catching up on Hiaason's Miami Herald columns on the Internet prior to the release of SICK PUPPY. Throughout the book, I thought I was reading drafts for upcoming columns for the newspaper. I realize that Hiaason has very strong views on the environment, commercial development (ex., Disney), and politics, but he may have directly injected a bit too much into his latest book. It's still a very good book, and I have recommended it to several people. But I was a bit disappointed. (Maybe I should quit reading the Herald!)"
1,GALLANT GALLSTONE REVISITED,"NOT FUN. NOT FUNNY. PREACHY. DISGUSTING. IF YOU WONDER WHY PEOPLE ARE GIVING IT GOOD REVIEWS READ ""THE FOUNTAINHEAD"" AND FIND OUT WHY PEOPLE GAVE GOOD REVIEWS TO THE GALLANT GALLSTONE. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I DID WITH MY COPY FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GALLANT GALLSTONE AND YOU WILL GET THE IDEA. YOU SEE I DIDN'T WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE POLLUTION OF THE HUMAN MIND."
2,Too crude,"This book was chosen by my book club. Our goal was to read something that would make us laugh because we had just read several deep, gut wrenching books in a row. Although the language was raw, it did not turn me off as much as the portrayal of the ""twin"" Barbies and the treatment of the animals. Did I laugh? I have to admit that I did multiple times. I also admired what Hiaasen was trying to do for Florida (my second favorite state) but the crudity left me with an aftertaste I found hard to get rid of."
5,A Fun Romp,"I really enjoyed this book. 4-1/2 stars.Hiaasen creates great characters that leap off the page and into your lap. The best word I can find to describe this book is a romp: through the sordid politics, crime, backroom deals, real estate development scams, and corruption of Florida. This is not a ""serious"" book; it's a page-turner. However, within his light-hearted, funny, sad, money-addled view of Florida, Hiaasen does have some serious points to make.This is my first Hiaasen novel (I've bought more since). The book to which I would most closely compare Sick Puppy is Edward Abbey's The Monkey Wrench Gang. In subject, style, and message, they are close parallels. Both are excellent.Enjoy!"
2,Not his best,"I have read all of Carl Hiaasen's previous books and really loved them. Could not find anything negative to say about his writing but Sick Puppy is another matter.It just seems more of the same repeated again and again. It does have its amusing moments but they are between countless pages of repetition. If you have read his earlier books, you would know exactly what this book is about and that is normally a good thing, but this time, the characters were a bit dull and the action too drawn out for my tastes.Most disappointing. I will put the book back on my bookshelf and hope that Hiaasen's future books are better."
3,Fresh,"This was a fresh change for me and mostly good fun. The author has a terrific imagination and had me laughing out loud a few times. It concerns a one-man eco-terrorist, named Twilly Spree and how he bites off more than he can chew when he stops going after individuals and starts going after corporations/governers. It seemed to take a while to get going because the author has a lot of 'setting up' to do at the start, I'd recommend perservering. Now and again the author overdoes things, like with a two-legged ocelot and even with the main characters name, but I willed the suspension of disbelief; it is, after all, meant to be lunacy."
5,Delightful tale of comic mayhem,"This is one of those books that you just love to read over and over again to marvel at the prose. Hiaasen's comic inventiveness and characters are priceless. It's not light fare, being that a few die some rather gruesome deaths, but even that is entertaining."
1,Find something else to read,"The characters were not realistic and the story line was disappointing. People were being killed, girls were being imported from overseas and were provided with plastic surgery, and the theme was that people can act in bad ways if there is a good reason for it. I had a very hard time finishing this book. Find something else to read."
2,"Fun moments, but I feel cheated","This book started so well. It grabbed me right out of the gate, it made me laugh, and it kept me turning the pages. But in the end, I felt ripped off. Not a single major character changed throughout the course of the story.When I read a book, I want to see the main character grow; or at least learn something about themselves or the world around them. 450 pages is a lot of space for an author to make that happen. But, based on where all of the primary characters in this story wound up, the book could have just as well ended after the first scene."
4,Sick puppy,"Outstanding book. Hiaasen makes words come alive! One of those Fla mystery novels that I couldn't put down. Characters are a blast. My first Hiaasen book, but not my last."
4,so so cute!,"Bought this for a friend who didn't have internet at the time. It was so so cute on her! she's not overweight, but not skinny like the girl in the pic either and it looked amazing. It was really nice that it came with all of the accessories. Quality was good too...not like some of the cheaper costumes that look like they're going to fall apart if you put them on!"
2,"Looks nice, but was disappointed! I will be returning it.","I bought this fountain for a party and did much research comparing with other brands. I thought this would be best because of size, and liked the stainless look. Easy to put together, but if you don't have the seal in just the right spot your drink will leak out all over the table.(test first with water).Pump is VERY loud, very distracting if you want an elegant party, but would work if all your parties are of the loud dance type. Lastly it splatters, and it's alot if you run it for hours. With a sweet drink you will have a sticky residue all over the table and floor. I am ordering a Rival brand that claims it runs quieter. I hope I'll be more happy with that one. I would NOT recommend it."
4,Bella Cucina Punch Fountain,"Have used this 6 times now. It does splash quite a bit, but I do like the fact that it holds 3 gallons-most other plastic fountains hold a maximum of 2 gallons. Have learned the hard way that care must be taken to be sure the gasket on the bottom is lined up properly or it WILL leak. Also found that the center piece where the ""bubbles"" come from overtime will get ""gummed up"" from the sugar and needs to be soaked in soapy water before it will work again. The cups do fill up rather slowly, but overall a great value for the money. Actually purchased a second one and used both at a school graduation reception-made a big hit!"
5,Great Halloween Book!!!!,"This is me and my son's favorite autumnal book. I have been reading it to him since he was three years old( he is now 6) , and he loves to read along when we get to the pumpkin part and his ""wicked, wicked grin"". I do not think it is any scarier than Hansel and Gretel , The three bears or even The Three Billy Goats Gruff. It is beautifully illustrated, and shows how a person can calmly handle a scary situation."
3,A little scary for very young kids,"My seven and 4 year olds love this book, but I have to say I was hesitant to read it to the four year olds a second time. Before buying this book I would have liked to have known that the pumpkin was going to be threatening Mrs. McMurphy on each page and that she was going to eventually resolve the problem with pumpkin pie...this is more violent than I usually expose my kids to in their reading, although I realize people are going to say it's all in the fun of the season, and my kids did chuckle at it. So, I used it as a lesson in standing up to bullies (minus the carving knife!)... but still kept it out of our regular rotation... if you're looking for a great kid friendly, spooky, but not so scary halloween book, I would recommend The Little Old Lady Who Wasn't Afraid Of Anything, or for a fun and happy book The Runaway Pumpkin."
5,Is this the same DVD?,"My DVD has the same ISBN as the one featured here, but there are only 3 episodes. and the quality is very good. The Episodes are: Second Honeymoon, Trip To Lisbon, and The Proposal."
3,Safe?,Yes mine also came with a dent in the corner. You can't bolt this down so it isn't the safest safe. Find something else.
2,combo doesnt work,The safe's combination did not work. I called Honeywell and waited 30 minutes for customer service so I gave up. Choose a different company
3,Combination Code,The safe is nice. We can't open it because the combination won't work. We even called the company and it was the same combination as on the safe. Still won't open. We just use the key.
3,I only have one concern,"I looked at some other safes online and at the local stores around my house. I bought mine at Lowe's Home Improvement and was happy with the purchase. I read a review for a different safe that mentioned the combination on their safe was off by 2 numbers in both directions so, I played with mine. I was able to go anywhere from 5-8 numbers off of the actual combination First Alert provided me and the safe would still open...I'm not too happy with this and it does concern me a little bit but I still think it's a good safe will protect my pistol and gun ammo just fine."
4,It does the job.,"I bought the honeywell version. It does the job. But it is interesting that you can defeat the combination lock with one single key. Also it's a bit heavy for the shipping guys, cause it was a bit dinged up when it arrived."
4,Great,"Good safe, Bigger than I expected it to be. Shipped very fast. I have yet to test its waterproof-ness. Haha"
1,shipped damaged twice; packaging inadequate,"I can't really rate the product because the first one came damaged because the box and packaging was totally inadequate for a heavy safe, and the safe was scraped and dented. I ordered a replacement and the same thing happened. For this type of product, it's better to drive to your local office supply store."
3,Good safe but a headache to get delivered,I ordered the safe and once it was delivered i could not get it to open with the combination or the key. I found other reviews saying the same thing. I sent the safe back to Amazon and they sent me a new one. The new safe did work but was damaged. I read many other reviews with this same problem. I do not think it was Amazon's fault I think it was dropped by the delivery service( It does weight like 80 lbs). One corner of the box was smashed in. After having to already send the last one back I really didn't want to deel with it again. So i just kept it even though it is damaged.
1,Shipped Damaged & Hard to Open,"The product shipped damaged and is probably no longer water or fireproof. The combination is hard to use, so don't expect quick access. I lost the instructions and could not find the correct product documentation on Honeywell's website. I had to use another model and do many trials before figuring out the direction and # of passes."
1,Damaged Due to Bad Shipping & Handling,"I returned mine because the plastic exterior and insulation arrived severely damaged from bad packaging, shipping and handling. If this safe can't even survive UPS I doubt it can survive a real life fire and water."
3,It is what it is..,"I didn't have any of the problems with openning it or airing it out that others have noted. Both the combination and the key worked right off. It came with a large silica pack inside so there wasn't any ""odor"" or moisture present. It obviously isn't made to be bolted down, which would be nice, but I knew that when I bought it. It's OK but not an ""oh wow"" experience. After I decide where to put it I might see about putting some kind of enclosure around it to deter ""walking off"" with it."
4,Good buy for the money,"This is a relatively good safe, and I think it works well for what I need it for. Heavy enough that most wouldn't bother to steal it, and quality is good, but not exceptional. Good entry level safe I think for the money."
3,Buy at Lowes.com,"I just got this exact same safe at lowes for just under $110. And it's a pickup in town on my way to work. Worth saving $50 over, especially with poor shipment reviews! Buy this item at Lowes.com!!It's not overpriced on Amazon, but check out Lowes!"
4,"Great Safe, Lacks ONE THING.","When the safe arrived I was more than pleased, took me three opens before I memorized the 4 digit combination, it feels very rugged and sturdy. The metal twist dial threw it over the top and made me really happy with my purchase. The only issue and the reason I give it 4 stars out of 5 is that there is no pre drilled holes in the bottom to secure it to ground."
5,First Alert 209F water / fire proof safe,"This unit was the perfect choice for me to protect important documentation as well as some personal values. Heavy enough to make it a fixture once set, the mechanical combination works well and makes for a space efficient, protective storage for my items. Very strongly constructed, 4 number combination, great price."
3,Spinning back and forth,The sticker that was attached to the front of the unit gave opening instructions that didn't match the instruction in the manual. That was confusing. Turned out that the sticker instructions were for the first opening and the manual instructions were for subsequent openings... go figure. I would probably buy a digital one if I were to do it over. There are too many spins back and forth to track.
4,Good Safe,"The Safe came quick and at a good cost. Its mostly plastic but thats ok for paper work and small valuables. The only problem I have is that it has no way to be bolted to the ground. It wouldnt be a problem if it was a heavy safe (Less than 100 lbs). I'll just have to make some type of cage to bolt over it but for the price I paid, it will do."
3,Novel probes into family court and grandparents vs. parents...,"Warren Adler's ""Twilight Child"" is a heartfelt novel. It could break your heart, but yet some parts feel really contrived, and almost all the main characters do something boneheaded. In this novel, a woman with some self-esteem issues finds love with her boss after she is widowed. She eventually finds enough strength in herself to move on and remarry, but she also takes her son out of the lives of her dead husband's parents. A couple years pass, and the grandparents decided to sue to try to get visitation, and the courtroom drama starts as the judge has to weigh the law against human emotion, and find a solution that is fair."
2,"Decent sound, not so decent durability.","I used these for about 8 months, at normal volumes. They have decent sounds.My left speaker started buzzing after 6 months, the companies warranty was expired, so I had to fix them myself."
2,wont fit,i was told by the sizing feature on amazon that these would fit my 96 chevy z71......the magnet is to big and wont fit into the space now i have to modify the truck to make this speaker fit which is exactly what i don't want to do
2,Bad choice,Theses speakers have a very low volume output. It was not what I was expecting when buying this product. Next time I will make sure what I am buying.
3,mega gla,I haven't really gave them a try as been ill and having problems. will be using in a few days.
5,2nd Time Around is One of a Kind,"I consider myself to be an avid reader, but this has to be one of the best books I've ever read. These reviews are definitely on point. From the first page to the last, you're are drawn in to this world. The characters, language, author's use of grammar is second to none. Just a word of caution, it is extremely hard to put this book down once you start reading it, you have been warned!"
5,Great Book From An Up & Coming Author,This a great book from an up & coming author. The humor & spiritual ties of the novel are very uplifting. I recommend this novel to everyone that enjoys reading. The 2nd Time Around is a must have novel.Mrs Jessica DavenportSouth Carolina
4,Long but GREAT,"This is one of the best books i've read in quite some time. The novel is long, but its great. The climax and ending is worth the wait. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars because my stomach was cramping from laughter. Easily the funniest book of 2006!"
5,THE CHARACTERS ARE AMAZING,"I LOVE THIS BOOK. THE CHARACTERS ARE AMAZING. THE DIALOG SEEMS SO REAL AS IF MR. HAWKINS ACTUALLY RECORDED CONVERSATIONS FROM PREVIOUS ENCOUNTERS THEN TYPED THEM INTO THIS NOVEL. THE BROWNS HAVE NOTHING ON THE MATTHEWS. MORE OVER MADEA, LINDA HAS ARRIVED"
1,Dissapointed,"I read the reviews on this book, and could not wait to order and receive it. I was so dissapointed. The storyline was hard to get into because the whole book was dialogue. It was few and far between statements to set the mood and help the imagination. It was a book of nothing but conversations to the characters, which made it hard to get into. I wish I could return it. However, I wish the author much success."
2,Really Sappy,I admit that I have enjoyed some sappy romance novels (Sandra Brown). I also enjoy science fiction from time to time (Heinlein). However if this was the first romance audiobook I'd ever heard I would never have returned to another. I gave it two stars only because the premise had promise. The story is secondary and reliant on repeated descriptions of passion to fill space. I found the passion unexciting and unwarranted . I have to think this is an early book of Brockman's. I've read at least one other book by her and know she has progressed well beyond this level.I can't recommend this book and find it a bit surprising anyone would. There is so much better out there even for romantics like me.
5,Suspesory Support,Extremely comfortable and well fitting. Most people you meet won't even know you're wearing it. I provides needed support for those of us who may have have issues that require additional support in this sensetive region.
4,An Insight To Understanding His Poems,"""The Noise Of Time"" is an excellent book to understand the background on the development of this great Russian poet. This autobiography engages all your senses with vivid and detailed description of his youth in St. Petersburg before the World War 1. Be warn readers, avoid reading the long Introduction by Clarence Brown; it is the best sleeping aid in the world."
5,Gnosis: The Mysteries and Christianity,"Welburn offers an important anthology of writings that takes us inside the sources of ancient Gnosticism and the Mysteries which stand enigmatically as handmaidens to the birth of the Christian religion, and still point out to us hidden depths of its spiritual significance otherwise largely lost.Also by Welburn: a companion to the present volumeThe Beginnings of Christianity: Essene Mystery, Gnostic Revelation and the Christian Vision; an anthology of Manichaean textsMani, the Angel and the Column of Glory: An Anthology of Manichean Texts; a study of ZarathustraThe Book with Fourteen Seals: The Prophet Zarathustra and the Christ-Revelation; and lastly, an examination of the virgin birthFrom a Virgin Womb: The Apocalypse of Adam and the Virgin Birth (Biblical Interpretation Series)."
3,would have given it four stars....,"Best you know you are buying a Northerners idea of collard soup. It is really white bean soup but tasty! It is worth buying due to the short prep time. Tastes like you simmerered the beans all day. By the time you cook the corn bread the soup is also ready to eat!High starch but good fiber source as well. Serves two very generously and definitely three, maybe four, with smaller appetites or extra sides.Did I mention tasty? Just do not expect collard soup with lots of collards."
3,green leafy vegetable,If you lack dark green vegetables this will substitute. You must add flavor and a starchy dish to accompany it.
4,Selmer Prelude Student Flute,"The flute was what I expected, having owned Selmer instruments in the past. I was disappointed at how long it took to process and ship the order. I placed the order on Dec 11th and it didn't ship until the 17th. I tried to email the company twice but got no response. I did call to see what the status of the order was and the person on the phone was very pleasant and helpful."
5,It Blows!,This product does what it is supposed to do ... it blows! The pressure lasts plenty long to do what is needed. I completely dusted out my computer tower in one session with this product ... no problem. The lemon scent is very light and the price is right. Recommended. By the way ... Net Wt. 10 oz. (284 g)
2,Dan's review,The pressure declines in the can after 10 seconds of use and you have to wait an hour tobuild up enough power to clean;similar to other products.
2,Memorex 152A AIR DUSTER LEMON SCENT ( 32028022 ),"When this product arrived, most of the printed label on the can had been wiped off, it looked like something you would see at a yard sale, old and used. The smell of lemon was fine, and it worked well, but the can felt lighter than other cans of air."
3,OK But...,This stuff comes out liquid if can is not right side up. Pretty scary when you spray it on energized electronics.
1,Do not get this version,"Firstly a single edit of the title track is a bit of a rip off.If buying this cd, make sure its the UK version with the wounded buffalo mix which is the best mix there is of this song.The AUS version does not have this, instead has the Dlugosch mix and dub, where the dub is just an instrumental of the mix cd... lame. The Dlugosch mix isnt too bad, very disco.The Bob Sinclair mix is OK, a bit long overall."
3,"Get this version, still ordinary single though","Firstly a single edit of the title track is a bit of a rip off.If buying this cd, make sure its the UK version with the wounded buffalo mix which is the best mix there is of this song.The AUS version does not have this, instead has the Dlugosch mix and dub, where the dub is just an instrumental of the mix cd... lame. The Dlugosch mix isnt too bad, very disco.The Bob Sinclair mix is OK, a bit long overall."
1,"Get the UK edition, not this mix/dub version","The lead off single is only a radio edit... whats the point of that if there is only one single?If buying this cd, make sure its the UK version with the wounded buffalo mix which is the best mix there is of this song.The AUS version does not have this, instead has the Dlugosch mix and dub, where the dub is just an instrumental of the mix cd... lame. The Dlugosch mix isnt too bad, very disco.The Bob Sinclair mix is OK, a bit long overall."
5,The Best Stapler I have ever used,"As a senior citizen I have probably used more staplers than most people. The Stanley Bostitch Plier Stapler works better for me than any other. It does not jam. It will take even small segments of staples--when the strip of staples breaks, for example--and never miss a beat. It also staples more sheets of paper together than any other stapler I have used. Other staplers have a tendancy to bend staples and disfigure staples when 10 or more sheets are stapled together. This stapler punches through every time and secures all the sheets perfectly. I love it."
5,A great book,"This book was really helpful on engine creation with DirectX 9. You should have a little knowledge of DirectX 9 in my opinion. Just for the mere fact that some topics arn't covered in 100% detail (but then again when is any book like that?) so it'd be good to have some background with DirectX 9, if you don't you shouldn't have that much trouble."
1,Man does this book suck!,"This book is terrible! You read through the whole thing, and you don't even learn anything!I would strongly recommend people not to buy this book.Otherwise, you just wasted 30 dollars on worthless bs."
2,"Pretty good, except for the battery","I have to agree with other reviewers here that the battery life is terrible on this tool. I also had a previous good experience with a Skil screwdriver that I had for 5 years before the battery finally went. I replaced it with this unit because I liked the light and the articulation features (which are great).My only other complaint is that the flathead and phillips bits are 2 separate pieces and theres nowhere on the screwdrived itself to store the unused bit, making it easy to lose. My previous Skil screwdriver had a reversible bit that was much more convenient."
1,Bad choice,"I had the older skil 3.6 volt model and after seven years of heavy use screwing screws into the backs of picture frames the switch went on it. It was a great tool so I thought the newer model would be fine. WRONG! It's cheaply made light plastic and the bit wobbles unevenly while driving screws in. The speed is painfully slow and the battery life stinks. The stickers on the unit where crooked and actually falling off. I can't return it now because I threw out the box it came in. I guess skil jumped on the ""make it cheap and throw it away"" band wagon with Black and Decker. I'm cutting my losses and getting a Bosch PS10-2."
4,Returned Goods,The Skil 2936 was returned to you as I found the identical product at Menards ten dollars cheaper ($10.00). That was the first time I returned anything to Amazon for that reason.I will give your return goods policy 5 Stars.Robert A. Nadolny
4,A reference !,"This is just the book you need if you really want to understand CFC and all the Object Oriented Programming Concept behind it. I had previous basic knowledge on OOP, but in this book, everything is clear. You understand the purpose of the CFC and how to use them. Simply brillant!"
1,Rushed and Confusing,Hard to believe this book had only two authors. A real dissapointment from Hal Helms after reading this Fusebox books.Save your money and wait for something more concise and focused to come out.
2,"Simplistic, worthless and mistake-ridden.","This book is completely worthless. You are better off reading the documentation in ColdFusion about components. The examples are very simplistic and do not help to address why and how to use components in real-world applications.There are also dozens of mistakes, including spelling, grammar and in the code examples which often make the examples difficult to follow. The numbered paragraphs are useless and seem to serve primarily as a way to increase the number of pages in the book. (If you do not include the code examples, this book probably contains only about 20 pages of writing.)If you do buy this book, I implore you to skip the ""Closing Thoughts"" section which is an imaginary conversation between 3 developers that rambles on for 10 pages yet says nothing of value.I will say the book is aptly titled: it helps you ""discover"" CFCs, but it does little to make them useful. I am considering sending this book back and asking for a refund. It's that bad."
5,One of the Greatest Novelas,"This is one of the best Telenovelas of all time. This DVD, like the others in this series, is an edited version, but shows from beginning to end the whole story. It does leave out alot of details but you still get 4 1/2 hours of footage. I recommend this to anybody who has seen or never seen the novela. I was very happy just to experience the novela again."
5,A new discovery,"for me. I just downloaded the free ""Gothic sampler"" MP3 compilation from Amazon on a whim. Over half of the tracks were uninspired/uninteresting but this one in particular stood out. I am a Nightwish fan and found this group to be in a similar genre. So I took a chance on buying the CD from an Amazon seller. It is offered in several price ranges but I was lucky to find it quite cheap from one vendor. It is very good--too bad the group is now defunct. This is a rare gem with several very good songs/poems on it. Definitely a keeper for me."
4,Taste of History,"I actually had the LP, back during the turbulent late'60s - early '70s. And here we are, more than 30 years later, and the sentiments expressed in the title song couldn't be more cogent in these days of a bumbling chief executive and more death, all around, in Iraq. We sure haven't learned very much in the interim. Sure, the song has an overwrought quality to it - but it's still quite effective, and beautifully sad in sections. Peter Rowan's voice isn't especially wonderful, but its strained, almost reedy quality serves this song well.Beyond the title song, we have a mixed bag. ""Home to You"" has aged well, I think. ""Mad Lydia's Waltz"" is a little known gem. Only ""Roast Beef Love"" and ""Sanctuary From the Law"" seem like throwaways, to my hearing at least.Overall, this CD is highly recommended. At only about 37 minutes in length, it's rather short. But there are several high points that will reward the listener."
2,Doesn't have the magic it had years ago,"I was excited to rediscover this album. But frankly, the years have not been kind to it. The title song remains strong, but the rest have faded to filler."
2,"Poor presentation, poor contents","Dissapointing book about a subject which can lead to all sortsof theories. It has some interesting theories but they are poorlyinvestigated and/or explained.Too much emphasis on old fashion kind or racism to explain the unexplainable. It left me feeling that someone somewhere can do better than this, writing about the same conspiracy theories and developing them in a more professional way to share a brighter light on a very sad event."
1,A Disappointing Read,"I can't take a book seriously that is full of typos and misspelled words. At one point, the author refers to Diana's friend James Gilby as ""James Gibby""."
3,"good drill, crumby charger","I've had 2 Skil cordless drills so far. My first was a 9v, very plain, worked fine. Until the charger died. They wouldn't sell me a new charger because there was a safety recall on it but they did send me a completely new drill (that was nice), which is this one.I've had it a bit over a year and this charger has now died, too. The drill is fine. It has nice power, the torque clutch works just right. The only thing that bugs me about it is that the chuck is at an odd angle from the body, which is angled from the handle. For me, this makes it difficult to drill a straight hole.I could have replaced the charger for a bit less than $20, but I didn't, and I used it as an excuse to buy a Craftsman. We'll see how that does."
3,Nice Drill .... Chargers are junk.,The Drill is a good one for around the house type of tasks.I have had the Skil 2467 for maybe a year and the charger quit working.I'm not sure I would buy another Skil 2467 drill.Skill needs to improve their chargers because this is the second one that quit charging.The first one melted.Might have to spend a little more money and buy a DeWalt or Milwaukee.
2,Bosch/Skil charger problems,"The charger failed and ruined the battery. Replaced the charger and battery and the replacement charger failed. Bosch did a recall on the 14V model due to the charger, but I have not seen a recall for the 12V model although there must be a similar issue."
3,Weird Video,The Music is Cool But The Video is Weird! I Have Nightmares About it! WARNING: If You Are A Kid Don`t Watch The Video Alone.Let a Parent Watch it With You.
3,Orchestra sounds great but I'm not wild about the conducting,"To my knowledge, this recording is the only show in town.The Orchestra of the Royal Opera House plays beautifully; however, Bonynge conducts much of the music at an undanceable tempo (the opening of the scene at the Port of New Orleans is a prime example). There is virtually no rubato throughout. Bonynge never seems to breath with the phrasing. I can't see anyone dancing to many of his tempi.I don't understand conductors who have different tempi for the concert hall and the stage. After all, the music was composed/arranged for the ballet. (I don't know whether Bonynge in particular employs different tempi, but I'd feel sorry for any company that had to dance at the tempi he's chosen.)"
1,"Bad product, look for other options before purchasing.",The screen is almost impossible to veiw rendering this device useless in most circumstances. I plan to return it and look for an alternative.
3,In a 'funk' with this one...,"I am a BIG fan of Spiderbait (see my other reviews), however no matter how many times I have listened to this one, I just can't get into it as much as their previous gems ('Grand Slam', 'Ivy and the Big Apples'). I always give all artists some leeway on any new CD, especially alt acts as they are trying new things all the time (god forbid we get the same CD every year!). The result on this one was a handful of great new tunes - which sounded very much ones on 'Grand Slam', and a lot of pointless tunes that seemed to go nowhere.This is for serious fans of the band only, or fans of techno-alt, which most of the songs tend to be on this one. Although the CD has some 'trademark' Spiderbait raw-grungy and poppy-alt, the rest has something I really can't describe very well - it all just seemed very repetitive. Spiderbait has made some of my all time favorite songs, and I was just generally disappointed that there was just no shine to Wally Funk for me."
2,Driven Man: David Richards,"As a biography on David Richards the man this book fails miserably, it's more of a biography about Prodrive the Company than it is about David Richards. There is very little by way of background about how David Richards thinks, runs his buisness nor indeed how he really got to where he is today. To sum the book up in one word - for me that word is - disappointing."
5,LuSh-iLiCiOuS,"This is the most coolest cd I ever bot-see my brother had this first. So when I was thinking of music I remeber ""Ladykillers"" because I saw the music video and I liked the song rhythem. But Miki Beryni rocks I think I spelled her name right. But ""lOvelife"" is like a rock-and-soothing music. I wanna get ""SpiLt"" since I heard reviews that said its like the best of Lush.DAN"
2,WHAT A DISAPPOINTING PIECE OF POP LAMENESS!,"I loved Lush. I loved what they did with guitars, vocals, production layers and lyrics. They stood out musically and lyrically. Beautiful sounds came from the voices and guitars. Gala and Spooky were stunning works that set the stage for Split, what I feel is their most fully realized and cohesive album. Then, this thing came along!? Just sounds like they had to make a commercial album for the new label. Maybe they wanted to finally cash in after scraping by for years. But, there is very little here of the Lush that made the three previous albums. That's sad, cuz that Lush was a great band. I saw them in Cincinnati's Bogarts on the Split tour, and even met Miki and Emily. They were very nice and gracious. That was the end of Lush for me. This is a stinker. R.i.p. Mr. Acland"
3,It's pretty OK,"Here is an unspectacular CD. I don't remember what prompted me to buy it almost 10 years ago. Maybe it was the fact that they played on the second Lollapalooza tour. Well, anyway. There are some sorta catchy songs here and it is kind of cute to here the ladies sing without obscuring their British accents."
3,Recycled,"Made in CAN, Serial# 440-014-377-2, Playing Time 47:51This Canadian band from the 70's released 5 studio albums, 1 live album, and 1 ""best of"" album; after calling it quits, Kim Mitchell (of ""Go For Soda!"" and ""I Am A Wild Party"" fame) decided to go solo.The 12 tracks contained on this disc consist of a strange combination of ""hits"", like ""Gravity"" and ""Diamonds Diamonds"" (the latter used as the title for their original greatest hits), and some less successful material, both commercially and musically, like ""Blowing The Blues Away"" and ""Blue River Liquor Shine""...Yes, MAX WEBSTER did produce a lot of good material; unfortunately for us buyers, we don't get a whole lot on this, which is sad considering there's about 30 minutes of unused space... For the un-initiated, the track ""Battle Scar"" features a collaboration with RUSH.I would suggest the ""The Best Of Max Webster Featuring Kim Mitchell"" CD instead!"
1,Worthless,"Ok, this product looks great but does not work. I do not think that it removed 1 hair. It is kind of hard to remove hair when it does not spin as soon as you apply pressure. Do not even try it and if you don't like it get your money back. Don't waste your time. Very dissapointed."
2,jig saw,"After using the saw for less than a week, the blade roller assembly spring broke. This was one of the specific reasons I bought the saw."
1,Only good for light duty rough cuts,Like many reviewers have said this tool is pretty much useless. I've only been able to use it for making rough cuts when precision isn't necessary. The blade holder and roller system doesn't provide a positive lock. Also the scroll/orbital switch keeps popping into the scroll position in the middle of a cut. I really can't recommend this tool except for the carrying bag can be used for other purposes.
1,Worthless,"Like another man I bought the hype on the box. Loved having a light, while it worked, and small projects on 1/4"" stock seemed to go well. Later tried 3/4"" ply and found I could not cut a straight line but also the cut would not stay perpendicular to the surface. Turns out the roller guide which should keep the blade straight pulls away from the blade on the downstroke and the blade crawls outside the guide giving me a nice 70 or 80 degree angle instead. I wasted over $90 I do not have to waste. Skil will never see another dime of my money."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I originally bought this saw without conducting any online research which turned out to be a huge mistake. I have been using the jig saw for the last month and have yet to get a quality cut with the saw. I tried switching out the blades but to no avail. Do not waste your money on this saw!! I gave it one star becuase it can make a cut, just far from the quality that I would expect."
1,Not a quality tool.,"If you need to make a casual straight cut in something that you otherwise would hand cut, this may be good enough for you. But if you need to make any kind of curved or scroll cut, forget it. This saw is just not very precise. Curve cuts end up with a non-vertical bias that ruins the piece.I had a Skil 3/8"" VS drill that had play in the bearings and eventually failed after a year or so of light homeowner use. I hate to bash Skil in general, but this the last tool I buy with their name on the side. Their stuff is cheaper for a reason.This is a case of getting what you pay for. Trust me, you'll want to pay a little more."
1,a hazard,"first of all, like someone already mentioned 2 finger start button is dangerous. second, the blade fell out while i was cutting twice, and i wasn't putting to much pressure on it either. just an accident waiting to happen."
5,Great Book to Teach You The Wining Essentials,"This is another great book in the Frank Scoblete Get the Edge series and, as a poker player, I am happy to see that Frank's line is now incorporating this game. Bill Burton, the casino guide for About.com, has done a great job of boiling down the essentials of Texas Hold em to a series of rules and betting strategies that I find right on the money. Even as a long time player, I learned a lot from Mr. Burton. This book is an excellent book for beginners and somewhat more experienced players. Burton is easy to read and the book should be one of the two or three must books for starting players to master. Good job all around!"
5,Solid information you will re-read,"Again, just last night, I picked up this book and found the info I was looking for. I have the other standard poker books but I like this one because it is SO easy to read and understand. Very good advice. Highly recommended."
1,Old book ... not as represented,"This is a more than 10 year old work on poker. It is so old the pages are yellow, and the info in it is not very fresh, nor comprehensive. Don't invest in this to improve your game. Spend a bit more and get some of Dan Harrington's books!"
4,Very nice introduction,"This is a very nice compendium of information in a field that can be intimidating to the novice. I was not completely unfamiliar with recording in general, having recorded once (long ago) in a local studio and having owned a chinsy four-track. However, a trip into the recording section of Guitar Center was overwhelming, and browsing around Digidesign & Opcode's websites for basic information was like trying to learn addition from a differential equations text.Paul White's book provided a nice range of tutorial information, as well as a general overview of the development of digital recording, up to the state-of-the-art. I found the digression on Mac vs. PC to be amusing. In any case, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to back up and understand digital recording from first principles."
5,THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT,"I have six dogs (BIG dogs) this product is a life-saver when going out in public with the dogs and don't have time for baths. I spray product on a paper towel--pretty heavily, and go at it -- all over the dog--they kind of like it too. As you are ""buffing"" them, their coats become clean, develop a wondeful healthy shine and they smell terrific!No complaints whatsoever about this product. It's a keeper"
3,The Chalk Garden/Hayley Mills,"The movie is a classic, however, they did not ""inhance"" the picture for the new widescreen T.V.'s they have out today, therefor your watching this ""small"" picture in the center of your ""large"" screen. Very upsetting Dennis"
5,GREAT MOVIE!,"first saw this movie as a kid on late night tv. it actually kinda scared me as Deborah Kerr is cold and <to a child> rather menacing. but she - and especially Hayley Mills - are both at the top of their game acting-wise in this terrific, beautifully done thriller (not in a slasher way) movie. their back-n-forth mental games are intriguing, captivating, and a joy to watch. John Mills is the perfect foil to both Miss Kerr and (his daughter) Hayley. never actually taking sides but his character knows how to play for and against both of the female leads. wonderful movie. ENJOY!"
4,The Chalk Garden,"A fine Bagnold play, well realized onscreen, with very commendable performances by Deborah Kerr, Haley Mills, and Edith Evans. A good addition to anyone's DVD library."
5,They don't make them like this anymore,Old school DRAMA! Great characters and unruly Haley Mills! I saw this when I was a kid and it made a big impression on me.So glad it's available on DVD.
4,The bosstown sound late sixties please,"Earth Opera was a boston sound band. I know, I was there. Peter Rowan was the driving force. Billy Mundi drummed for Frank Zappa and then Rhinocerous. David Grisman was madolin man since moby dick was a minnow, check him on Gratful Dawg dvd with Jerry. Any way every RED SOX fan needs this song in their collection. The Red Sox Are Winning. This song has been around since the late 60's. As for Peter Rowan he went on to Seatrain and they need to be in every good rock collection too.. So start listening. I loved Eden's Children, Beacon Street Union were good too. Ultimate Spinach was a favorite too but then if you wanted to make out it was Orpheus for the young and in love.... Only in Boston. Thanks Amazon for having your library at my fingertips. Charlie"
2,"Unusual, but too meandering","Intriguing but ultimately discardable record. The most useful reference point is probably the early ""pretty"" Tim Buckley albums with their florid mix of folk and jazz, but Earth Opera comes off more dainty and less tuneful. And Peter Rowan's voice isn't nearly as powerful or versatile as Buckley's. On the positive side, the clear production and polished, acoustic arrangements make this disc surprisingly undated and easily able to blend in with contemporary ""freak-folk"" acts. So, I see potential for this album being re-discovered. And of course, the Grateful Dead fanbase always will be around. Favorite track: the more tightly melodic ""When You Were Full of Wonder,"" which hits me from a pleasing Dylan/Donovan angle."
