1,Not Worth It,all i have to say is trust me do not buy this dvd its really bad! we got it when my wife was pregnant and we were excited when we got it but when we started playing it.... my god we were disappointed! not worth it )
2,"Nice, but not quite right for bodywork sessions","This is a sweet, quiet album, however, it doesn't quite work for a massage therapy or other bodywork sessions. While the music itself is not intrusive, there are occasional ""bum"" and off notes that filter in through the hour-long piece that can be distracting in a quiet bodywork session. While this would not be a problem if the music is just serving as background sound as you do other things, in a massage, a client's mind looks to the music for calm and focus. For many, music is an essential component of the relaxation response during a massage. I used this with a number of my regular clients and they each were distracted or jarred when an off note tumbled by. I certainly understand that one can't be perfect over an hour-long performance, but I find this unsuitable for massage for that reason."
5,Black and Decker VEC1047BD 750 WATT INVERTER,"very good price, well made, very useful product. has come in handy on many occ."
2,Not what it says it is!,This is NOT lotion. it's edible MSM liquid....not at all the same:( too much trouble to send it back so we tried it...NASTY doesn't begin to cover this!
5,Good stuff!,"Great!!! I have been using this for about 3 weeks now with the MSM soap. I can tell that my skin is more even toned and some of my stretch marks are less apparent. I'm not sure all that this lotion helps with, but it does wonders for my skin. I would definitely recommend!"
5,This Works where Presription Meds Failed,I have a type of psoriasis on my ankle that flares up frequently. When it flares up I have to put an ice pack on it to reduce the severe burning sensation. If I use this product every day the psoriasis does not flare up.Have tried many prescription drugs and none of them have worked. This is the only product that provides relief.I am very grateful to have the MSM Lotion.
2,"Grainy texture, no help for acne","In general, I've done very well with sulfur products in fighting my long-standing cystic acne. However, I found this MSM cream grainy, unpleasant and it had no affect either on dryness or my acne. Also, It's not suitable to wear under make-up. I understand it's worked for some people, but it didn't work for me."
1,Not a fan.,I bought this because I was doing the HCG diet. I did not like the smell of it. I later found that I could use Burt's Bees products and those are really nice.
3,o.k. by me,I actually liked this movie to a certain degree. The basic story is a crippled doctor and his staff are trying to use the power of re-generation in Draculas blood to cure the doctor. They bring Dracula back and have a certain amonut of control over him it would seem. Good action scenecs and the Vampire hunter Priest is very good. I would make a movie of this charcter alone I think. Of course Dracula gains the upper hand in an odd way as the group all want his power but not his evil. Sad to say they all get both which leads to trouble. The ending is so abrupt and confusing it almost ruined the entire movie for me. What does it mean?? It may have been tossed in to lead to the third movie. Aside from that it is not to bad.
3,UNFAIR - Only HALF a film,"This is not really a bad film, but I can not give it more than 3 stars as it is only HALF the story. It suddenly ends without a resolution to the main plot. In listening to the director's comment track, he states that they shot ""Dracula 3:Lagacy"" at the same time and simply cut the original film into 2 parts. This is completely UNFAIR. Now anyone interested in the film will have to wait, probably a year, to find out what happens and learn why some things occured and who people really are in the this film. Evidently we will find out who the ""priest"" really is - true vampire or one taking the ""cure"" of sunlight.It does help if a viewer has watched ""Dracula 2000"" as there are scenes that build on things from that film.Perhaps, if this film had told the complete story, it would deserve a higher rating, but I will have to wait until after seeing the FULL story."
2,The Best way to Ruin the First,"This is ridiculous making a sequel to Dracula 2000 ""which i gave 4 stars"". That one was awesome but a sequel. This [is] just [bad], i have no reason to even bother picking it up. Just a waste of good money.If you hate this one watch the first and you might like it!!"
2,JASON SCOTT LEE THE ONLY HIGH SPOT.,"THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS JASON SCOTT LEEAS THE VAMPIER KILLER. JASON SCOTT LEE IS SO COOL IN THISFILM, IT'S TO BAD DRACULA HIMSELF IS SO WEAK LOOKING AND BORING INTHIS FILM. THIS FILM COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER."
2,sequel my rear end...,"seriously this was no where near a sequel. The only reason you'd have any idea it was a sequel is that they found Dracula's corpse hanging from a cross on a roof on fire. You know where the last left off... everything that was set up is just mysteriously gone.Hellsing's daughter that vowed to be the new keeper of the Body of Dracula because she gained the ""gift/curse"" from her father leeching Dracula's blood to stay alive all these years is not even mentioned. Then you got the guy who played Mowgli from the live action jungle book movie coming from absolutely nowhere as a one man tainted with vampirism warrior priest armed with weapons stolen from the Soul Caliber videogames.At least if they made this a stand alone movie I'd have been able to go into it without overblown expectations.AND WHAT THE HELL WAS THE DEAL WITH THE GUY WHO'S ENTIRE FACE ENDED UP A FANGED VAMPIRE MOUTH?!?"
5,love this movie!,I love this movie and if you haven't seen it you need too! However the shipping takes forever it's been a week and I'm still waiting!
1,Wes Craven messed this one up bad,"Wes Craven comes back with Dracula 2, suprizing, he can't even make a crafty title. So anyways, everyone writes that this movie picked up where the other left off well it doesn't. It compleatly ruins the ending of Dracula 2000, it has none of the same charators, and the Dracula in this movie doesn't have any action, you think the movie is getting to a good part finally and then it ENDS!! This is definatly one of Wes's worst movies. Don't get me wrong, I love vampire movies, I've seen loads of them, and this is one of the worst sequels i have ever watched. I can't understand why this one ... so bad, Wes made tons of good sequels, but this isn't one of them. I'm very dissapointed."
5,I liked this a lot,"The reviewer who sees this as ""hate-inspiring"" is taking this a little too seriously. As a previous reviewer pointed out, supernatural beings in folklore are often endowed with some kind of activity they thrive upon be it counting things, drinking blood, eating people, hoarding gold, fixing shoes, etcetera. I don't think Dracula II was trying to pick on people with any kind of illness at all. The pale skin is often a trait of vampires because it's symbolic of them being ""dark"" and ""unholy"" creatures. That doesn't mean the makers of this film were saying anything about people who have health issues. Dracula II is a solid *fantasy* sequel that should be appreciated on that level."
1,You've got to be kidding me,"Dracula II: Ascension was on tv one night so i decided to give it a whirl because i am such a big fan of Dracula and vampires. I didn't expect much of the movie because i don't think that a sequel is appropriate for this story, because it is great in and of itself. There is nothing that needs to be added to the story. I know that it is the sequel to Dracula 2000, so i really shouldn't have expected much from it. Dracula 2000 would have made an excellent movie if it had stuck to the original Dracula story by Bram Stoker, because it is such a great story and it would have been awesome to see the story in take place during modern times. This film shouldn't even have the name dracula in it because it strayed so far from the story. This movie further proves my point that it is hard to find a good vampire movie."
3,"better than the first, up till the ending","I thought this was a pretty new twist on a vampire flick, also was gory enough, and interesting enough,but my biggest beef was the ending: Its way to abrupt!! The good guy is on his way to fight the bad guy and the damn movie just ends????????? WTF? I felt jipped!"
2,BLOODY MESS,"This is a painfully inferior sequel to DRACULA 2000, which featured a marvelous performance by Gerard Butler as the doomed vampire. With this, we get a kung fu priest, played with as little emotion as possible by Jason Scott Lee; we get a wacko professor played with constrained malice by Craig Sheffer; a Dracula with no pizzazz, no power, only albino-like features; and a supporting cast of actors seemingly pulled from other bad b movies. Shame on writers Joel Sassoon and Patrick Lussier for forgetting what made their previous effort worthwhile: a good cast and some fresh innovations on the vampire legend. This one with its notion that vampires must untie all knots and count pebbles is so far out, it's goofy.I won't venture into the third of this series, which features of all people RUTGER HAUER as the vampire. This is one where there should have been no sequels!!!"
1,Should be Descension,"What a let down after Dracula 2000. Plot line was weak. Dracula doesn't do anything vampirish other than trying to seduce the female lead by thought only. He spends the entire movie in chains, until (A VERY BITTER) end. It is so anticlimatic--leaves you hanging high and dry. What happened?? One bright spot--Jason Scott Lee was fabulous as the vampire hunter."
3,Vampires always return,"This sequel concentrates on the human curiosity, not the fear or ambition to hunt vampires. It begins with the usual controversy between the supernatural and reiligion, then it quickly drifts into the scientific perspective of how vampires function. This element gives the movie a better edge than the first one, and a much better story. The vampire gore is very basic and redundant which is not easy to make unique since there have been and will be many more vampire films. It's entertainting and keeps you somewhat interested, the actors are obviously fresh in their field (except for Roy Scheider who makes a cameo) and the director is still learning how to tell a story on film. Overall, it is better than the original and it makes you root for the monster this time...who's to say the vampire is always the monster? Humans have evil in them also, watch the movie and see for yourself."
5,Magnificent,"As one has learned to expect from Huntford, a magnificent, exhaustively researched and wonderfully written account of the life of the great explorer and mediocre politician. Highly recommended, as are his biographies of Amundsen / Scott and Shackleton. Lives and times rarely get any livelier and timelier than this."
1,Fred Willard,Fred Willard is great but this is far from his greatest. You want to see Willard at some of his best try You Tube. I have many episodes of Fernwood Tonight that I taped off of TV many years ago but would love to see them released on a boxed DVD set. I do not recommend.
2,jamming problems,"i am disappointed with my purchase. after trying the HP Photosmart C8100 ($400), and the Epson Artisan 800 ($300), i decided to purchase a color laser printer to print flyers and to print on card stock. the Xerox Phaser 8560 ($600) seemed to have a slightly better print quality over the inkjets so i kept it. after buying $200 on Xerox Color Xpressions Elite cover paper to print business cards on, i ran my first job. the machine jammed after about 40 sheets into the run and continued to do so every 10, 20, or 40 sheets. i was so frustrated by the end of the job. it took 3x longer than it should have. so much for high productivity with this machine."
1,co$tly ink hog,"We purchased several of these thinking that it is a good high volume office printer. Having run them for over a year, we have actual cost data and it is costing us about $0.12 per page on average for pages that average less than 5% coverage! Add in the cost of keeping this heater running 24x7 and you will be thinking about buying an HP and trashing the Xerox printers."
1,this printer has deep flaws,"WAAAAY too many smears and streaks when printing double sided, wasting ink and paper and time. Cleaning to prevent ink smears wastes lots of new letter size paper.Ink sticks are extremely expensive (Xerox brand). Generic brand inks give horrible blues and cyans (Media Science brand).I would have preferred to buy a regular color laser printer with decently accurate color and no smearing on double-sided pages.This thing is a giant headache...I cannot recommend this printer. You can probably tell that I have just had to throw away a pile of double-sided prints, clean the printer for the 2nd time in a row, and try again.Serious, serious issues with this printer -- think twice before buying."
4,Taken Aback,"This book is worth reading for its insight and background on Uruguay alone. Richards' descriptions of the country and the political movements of South America betray an insider's knowledge. I was truly taken aback by how marvelously and accurately Richards was. The story of Orlando, one of the chief characters, is compelling.That said, I found the main story, about Nick Jordan, the journalist, to be less strong. Nonetheless, the book is highly enjoyable."
3,"Betsey Brown by, Sara A.","Betsey Brown is the story of a girl named Betsey Brown who lives in the extremely racist city of St. Louis in 1959 with her big, black family. Betsey is trying to grow up this discrimitive community, and do normal things a kid would do. Her father, Mr. Brown, is obsessed with the Civil Rights Movement and his job as a doctor. Betsey's 7 brothers and sisters all provide a bizarre and interesting life for Betsey who is just trying to be a normal kid.What does it mean to be an American? Betsey and her family, although African Americans of racist times, still practice their rights as American citizens. This is what America truly stands for. The equality of all people. Mr. Brown continually goes to Civil Rights rallies with his children. They express their opinions in movements that also show their American spirit."
3,No Dolby or DTS HD option - only Dolby Digital,"Some nice tunes on this. I only liked about 6 tracks myself but at this price that's ok. Video looks good but audio is Dolby AC3, somewhat of a disappointment. No excuse for not releasing this in Dolby HD & DTS HD formats. That being said the Dolby 5.1 sounds good, Dolby 2.0 loses too much quality and depth for my tastes and the horns are mixed to low at times. If you're into the New Orleans music scene,this should please."
4,Wrightsocks Anti Blister Double layer Coolmesh quarter sock,I have not had any blisters wearing them.They seem to be cool up to about 10 miles. They are very comfortable.
4,Hyped by Luke: An PeoplewholoveGoodBooks Review,"Hyped by Luke is the story of Maurice LaSalle, he is a gifted musician on the verge of becoming the next ""big"" thing. Like his best friend and bandmate Jamal Grover, he's living the life of a ""player"" until he meets Ebony Stanford. Ebony still dealing with the hurt from a painful divorce is attracted to Maurice but afraid to believe that he could be the ""one"". Eventually, they grow closer and fall in love and embark on a relationship only to have betrayal and secrets threaten to break them apart. It isn't until tragedy strikes that they realize just how lucky they are to find each other and love. Hyped is a steamy, romantic drama that grabs your attention from page one. I give this book 4 stars!! Reviewed by Shay C of PeoplewholoveGoodBooks"
5,Spann and Green - Match made in Blues Heaven,"I love Otis Spann. Both his solo work and as a member of Muddy Water's band. This album sees Spann hooking up with the original Fleetwood Mac line up san their drummer (what was his name?). Otis' piano nicely compliments Peter Green's guitar, which is a little more restrained then usual on this album. This album features some great rockin' tunes and as well as some excellent slow blues like 'Ain't Nobody's Business'.Don't be put off by the strange album cover. This is a great, great blue album. Also check out Fleetwood Mac's Engliash Rose for more great Peter Green material."
3,Not The Best Otis Spann CD,"I have about all of Otis Spann's CD's that are available. I did not care for this CD that much. The sound of his great piano playing was washed out and upstaged by the noisy guitars. Also, he departed from his traditional Chicago Blues CD and went with a more fast paced rock and roll type sound. I would recommend Otis Spann's Best Of Vanguard Years instead."
1,wrong item shipped,not worth my time to return a wiper blade: wrong blade. box was open & blade was not what belonged in that box.
5,Headache Relief,"My wife and I have used Nature's Answer White Willow Bark Standardized. It has provided relief for headaches. Occasionally a really bad headache is not relieved by White Willow Bark. On those occasions, we reach for acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Over all, we do like this product and prefer using it instead of OTC pain relievers."
4,elvis movies in the late60s,"elvis presley movie career was coming to a end hollywood last best elvis movie soundtracks.in the song edge of reality you can hear the maturity of elvis presleys singing voice,hollywood did nor catch it."
3,story fell apart in the middle,"I have read at least a few others of Laura Lee Ghurke's novels, and my general impression is that she either writes a great story (i.e. Conor's Way) or her plot falls apart. In this novel, the latter is clearly the case. The delicious romantic tension building up in the beginning just fizzles away. Secondary characters introduced late in the novel take up additional unecessary subplots, which detract from the interaction of our main protagonists. The villain was written just a little too one-dimensional. All in all, a good premise, but delivery falls short at the end."
2,Not really a good WWII movie,"The only thing good, and it's very good, about this movie is Maria Holvoe.Otherwise it's an unbelievable plot that could have used some direction to try to salvage it.Rent it, watch Maria Hovoe, and then move on."
1,"Clearly derivative, and much inferior","Pass on this one, and instead watch ""Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison"" (1957, Robert Mitchum, Deborah Kerr) and ""Hell in the Pacific"" (1968, with Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune), two much better films that, at least superficially, must have inspired ""The Last Warrior."""
5,Oh Yes,"This is by far the best of the bootleg series and, although a shorther version, this live cut of Nantucket Sleighride is so close to the studio version that it is almost perfect. Great mix and recording. Was surprised by Yasgur's farm showing up but its a great version. They said the band was only 18 months old at this time and they sure were hot. Must have for live Mountain fans"
3,pappalardi & west,I have ever since buying avalanche 1975 and because of that also bought twin peaks held pappalardi as one of the peaks among rock bassistsand he delivers so do west
1,These are supposed to be LARGE papers -- in whose world?,"Everything great thing that has been said about these liners is probably true--except for the LARGE part. I received my case of liners the day before I had to make 60 large cupcakes and was I ever surprised when I saw that they are only little more than an inch tall! So, here I am scrambling to find something else to use at the last minute and won't be able to do so without driving 75 miles each way. Then, what to do with 1,440 cupcake liners I don't want? Can't return them."
1,NOT Large! This is normal every day cupcake size.,"WARNING - UNRETURNABLE, STANDARD SIZE, NOT ""LARGE""......In no way, shape, or form, are these LARGE baking cups. I read the 2.5 inch and dutifully measured the bottom circumference of my large muffin pans..., which were exactly 2.5 inches across the bottom. Imagine my surprise when these arrived and they were your standard size, been making them since I was a kid, cupcake liner. Then, what fun! I find out that I can't return them to get the right size. I now have a lifetime supply of cupcake liners that I will never use, and I have to make 1200 LARGE brownie muffins in less than two days."
5,Awsome baking cups,"These are so much better than regular paper baking cups. I originally bought them because I wanted something that was unbleached & more natural. After I started using them I discovered that they are also much better quality than regular paper cups. Cupcakes & muffins do not stick to the papers, so you can actually eat the whole thing & don't have to waste the part sticking to the paper."
5,The best baking cup I've met,"All other baking cups I've ever used would consistently take part of the muffin when I peeled them off, no matter how carefully I peeled. In frustration I tried silicone muffin trays, which took care of the sticking problem, but left the bottom part of the muffin with a slick, unbrowned surface. These ""If you Care"" baking cups fairly drop off the muffin, and the muffin is left with a nicely browned surface that matches the degree of browning on the top. Two reviewers have complained that these cups are not large. They ARE large, as opposed to small cups. What they are thinking of should probably be termed a jumbo-sized cup. It's just semantics, although the manufacturer could make it easier on folks by providing dimensions in the specifications. For the record, these cups fit muffin trays with a mean diameter of 2.5"" and height of approximately 1.3""."
5,A Must-Read,"I'm not one for exaggeration, but it is safe to say that I owe any future success in my relationships to God through His work in this book. It helped me to clearly see how to be the man that God wants me to be, and that Christian women really find attractive; it gave me tips on the kind of woman to avoid, and it just help to set me upon the right road in knowing God for myself and trusting Him to lead my search for the right woman. I have been passing this book and this author on to all of my friends whenever relationship topics are mentioned, and I recommend her work wholeheartedly. God has given her an anointing and you will NOT be sorry you brought this book, whether you are a single guy or a single girl.The companion book for single women is virtually similar to this one; if you have the one, there is no need to purchase the other. I would suggest that you buy the one for your sex, even though they can both be appreciated by everyone."
1,Bait and Switch on the shipping!,"Watch out people, the amount they claim they charge for shipping is almost 1/3 what they try to nail you for at the check out. I've already filed a complaint with Amazon about this as I didn't catch the bait and switch pricing lie until after I had placed my order. Lucky for me Amazon canceled the order.Don't get cheated!"
1,Did not deliver on time as stated- wasted $23.99 two day chg.,Dec.20-submitted order. Dec.21-received confirmation. Paid $23.99 two day mailing charge for delivery by Dec.23-24 (*as stated*) to Washington State. As of Dec. 26.....it STILL had NOT arrived!!!
2,Not very gourmet,"I am a picky cheddar cheese lover. Take this review as you will. This came with four cheeses: Canadian, American, Irish, and Australian. Basically, the Aussie was OK, crumbly, a little dry, but good for grating. No better than half the vermont cheddars I've had. Irish was the best for me, a little creamier than the Aussie, but still sharp. My favorite of the bunch. The American cheese, it had the texture of a parm-reg, didn't melt, and tasted and chewed like rubber. Terrible. Now since it's only been 2 weeks since I have gotten this package, so I haven't tried the Canadian. It is definitely a little softer and less crumbly than the other two, I will update when I open the package. So far, one out of three was Somewhat good, but no better than your supermarket Tillamook or Colbert. Not worth buying online, that's for sure."
3,Forgotten Gift,Even though the cheese was ordered as a Christmas gift. It was shipped to my brother without an acknowlegement. He had no idea who sent it. I didn't find this out until last week. He just thought I had forgotten them at Christmas and assumed the cheese was from the company he worked for.
2,Depends What You Are Looking For,"If you feel like you are fighting the world, like right now it's you against everyone, then this book is for you. You'll relate to the character, you'll love the plot, and you will really get the message.If you do not happen to feel like that, most likely the message you will get is that this is a book to be read at another time or by other people.Overall, I really just did not find the book nearly as ""soul-baring"" and intense as the previous reviewers had described it. It wasn't terrible, but it was a bit of a let down."
3,Strange production and uneven songs sink it,"At only 12 tracks, it's one of their shorter albums (less than 28 minutes), and as their last proper album before the breakup, it seems to indicate a bit of creative brain-drain. There are some good tunes present, including I Know What You Want, The Damage Is Done, and Spend Spend Spend, but most of it is fairly mediocre, though Hellbound is a great instro with some nice sampling. If that were all, one might be tempted to pick it up, BUT there's the issue of production. It's an odd mix, one that makes it seem like the band is playing at the other end of a long narrow hallway. Duncan's voice is kinda tiny and indistinguished in the mix, and it's odd to think that their first album (Snuff Said) sounds better than Reach.Despite its weaknesses, Snuff fans will want to hear it. After all, it is an actual album unlike Flibbidy and Potatoes & Melons which were both mostly just covers and tossoffs."
5,Still an awesome thriller!,"Always been a favorite of mine. Even today, with all the modern special effects, this movie is grand. For anyone who has never seen this movie.. get it! It's a nail biter!"
5,A Real Cutup,"Impressive, easy to use and smart looking. This is a formidable compact unit. It gets the job done in short order. I had no battery issues or problems. It worked fine for me. It is a matter of seeing the glass half empty vs. seeing it half full."
2,Wish the charge lasted longer,"I would love this tool if only the charge lasted longer. It runs for approximately 10 minutes, 12 at the most, then the charge is done. Unfortunately I lost my receipt so I presume I cannot return it. The machine does a nice job of edging which is mainly why I bought it, but I'm very disappointed because I can only use it for about 10 minutes at a time, then have to put it on charge for another 24 hours."
4,Best thing since sliced bread!~,"I was determined to do away with the electric cord and this fills the bill. Much, much easier to use even though just a little heavier than the corded ones. Not having to move the cord every few seconds, tripping on it, stepping over it, etc. makes this thankless job almost fun. All my usual sources were sold out of this model. Thank goodness for Amazon.com!"
2,"Okay, not great","I have a very small yard, so this is adequate. It barely gets my whole yard done, before the battery needs recharging. Wouldn't recommend it for someone with a large area."
1,2 strikes and I'm done!,"I bought and returned 2 of these trimmers. The first one was used all of 5 minutes when the part that is supposed to rotate the string stopped spinning..the motor was still going full speed - the string head just wasn't spinning so I exchanged it. I used the 2nd unit twice. Both times the battery power depleted to next to nothing within 10-15 minutes - this after being on the charger OVER 24 hours! I called the B&D 800 number and was told the expected battery time for this unit was 15-20 minutes (which is not mentioned anywhere in the owner's manual or on the B&D website). I do not have a huge yard but I could barely get it finished before the battery died. I ended up taking the 2nd unit back last night and am going to get the Toro 8"" cordless trimmer. It doesn't have the edger feature but I know a few people that have it and love it - plus the battery life is 45 minutes - more than twice as much as the B&D."
1,cordless trimmer,"Ok, the first one I received did not have the internal fixtures to charge the unit. I called B/D and they had to send me a label to mail it back to them. They were nice enought and send one to me before they received mine back in the mail.I had arranged the delivery to be able to use it after a vacation. That did not work.Then I get the new one and charge it up and it keeps running out of battery life. I have a very small yard. I can not complete the front yard before the battery runs out and have to wait until the next day to complete it. Then, a third day to do the back yard. This is not what I expected.Disappointed, YES!"
4,One of the most frightening books I've ever read...,"I picked up this book to research Roland Freisler, ""Hitler's hanging judge"". What you will read on these pages is informative and frighteningly real. I was specifically looking for info related to Freisler and The White Rose trials... I was surprised and disappointed to find seemingly inaccurate information. I did, however, learn a lot about the laws in Nazi Germany."
4,Down to cellular health,"the book is written in the 1920s so it uses old english. Once I got over this, the material was exactly what I was hoping for. A medical doctor explains how a toxic environment is the basis for all disease and sickness. The end gets a little preachy in terms of raising children. The book is worth the money for the first chapters. I've read it 3 times and going on a third, it is like hearing a favourite story over and over."
2,Bland coffee candies in an attractive round tin,"These cute little coffee candies are the size and shape of coffee beans. There the resemblance ends. They are dust colored; the coffee taste is weak and vague. If you want an espresso taste, suck elsewhere."
1,"Good Idea, Bad Implementation","I think Mr Gold's book is a good idea and his heart is in the right place but he will not win any awards for simple explanations. I've read this book cover to cover, some parts multiple times, in an attempt to decipher what he meant versus what he said. I find it confusing that Mr Gold discusses vapor barriers in two parts of the book and seems to say different things in each section, for example. I'm an intelligent person and can follow directions but Mr Gold's writing style does not sit well with me nor did it help to truly understand what I needed to do. If you are building a wine cellar in an unfinished old stink cellar, this may be for you, but if you are building a wine cellar in a finished basement or other portion of your house, obtain the ""room preparation"" documentation from a ""wine enthusiast"" type company instead."
2,Disappointing,"If you're looking for wine cellar design and construction ideas, keep looking. This is an old text (1983) with some good theory and graphs, but little meat for someone wanting to build a wine cellar with today's tools and materials. Illustrations are sparse and a little rough.If designing, building and / or decorating a wine cellar are your main goals, save your money and get The Home Wine Cellar by Perry Sims instead."
3,Lots of information - but not well organized,"This book is full of extremely useful information - and I have learned quite a bit by reading it. However, the author's writing style and organizational method makes it a hard read.In concept, there are a number of items that must be considered when planning a wine cellar. These are covered in this book, but the information is not presented in a clear and concise manner. I would have expected basic information in a step-by-step and easy to follow format. Instead, the valuable content is surrounded by stories and other interesting but not exactly useful words.This appears to be the best book on this subject available today. Therefore, if you're going to build a wine cellar, this is the right book to buy. However, don't expect this book to make it easy for you."
5,Great Pharmacy Info Book,Great info book. It has everything that I wanted plus more. I always use it at work since I know it will always have the answer I was looking for.
5,Pure Sunshine,"I loved this short-lived series for its pure, zany sunshine. Yes, it's good to have dramas that explore the heavy issues, but isn't there a place for fun without cruelty or nastiness? The Greatest American Hero offers wish fulfillment, clever plots, deft acting, and laugh after laugh."
4,Disc 4 Trouble?,I can't find a copy of Season 2 without Disc 4 correctly labled but containing Disc 3 shows again. Anyone find a good set?
3,operation spoilsport,"I bought the second xeason for one episode, Operation Spoilsport. Imagine my surprise to find it ruined. They changed the music from Eve of Destruction to something else. It's not near the show I remember. I would suggest you wait on purchasing the set and see if they replace the music again, this tme with the right music they had to begin with."
1,Original Music Edited - Disaster!,"Loved the show originally, now w/ the replacement music, things just arent the same - these classic episodes have been marred, especially Operation Spoilsport - I can barely stand to watch the shows now. I was so looking foward to finally having this dvd collection to relive these shows how they were NOT how they were re-edited to save a buck. Plus, for the price they are asking per dvd set you'd think they paid some music licensing. Thumbs down to Anchor Bay and the shows producers who allowed this. Contact them and demand a re-issue."
1,I have to agree with the One Star Guy,"...Daniel.Where is Family Ties? Barnaby Jones? Roseanne? Quincy? Bewitched? I cringe when I walk down the isle of any dvd seller and week in, week out, see stuff like the Greatest American Hero. Truly, I'm not trying to rain on anyones parade but TRY to look beyond nostalgia if possible. This, Full House, Saved By the Bell and countless other shows were simply ""filler"" of the time and were not meant to be viewed beyond the networks need for time killers. I honestly marvel at people paying money for these shows while true gems may never see the light of day.I must add though, I LOVE Robert Culp though and love his work with real TV shows like Columbo.Also, do not think I do not like ""light"" television. I currently own all of the Hanna Barbera sets, but I know the difference between ""light"" and ""light-weights""."
1,Cover songs GONE,"A terrific show, presented in most lousy fashion on DVD. Cannell and company have seen fit to remove ALL the cover songs that were originally presented in the show, meaning such classic scenes like the 'Eve Of Destruction' scene in the episode Operation Spoilsport and GONE FOREVER.There is simply no excuse for this. It's just money, money, money. Buy the Japanese DVD box sets instead, which include ALL the original music - 100% as you remember it. This set is a travesty."
3,Greatest American Hero Season 2,Disk 4 is stamped with the same episodes as disk 3. Set only contains 18 of the 22 episodes.
4,Too good to be true!,"This series came out in 1981 when I was only six but it was everything I could remember it to be! Great job on the digital clean-up. Crisp sound quality. Breaks where you would expect commercials are not as good as other tv series dvds but it is almost unnoticable. The only thing that seems odd is in the pilot episode it seems that modern music was added to certain parts of the show. I know that sounds wierd but some of the music just doesn't fit for that time period. Still, I was happy to finally get this series!"
2,Not as good as I remembered,"With age, much of the magic is gone with this. Brief nostalgic moment, but almost unwatchable for complete episodes now."
3,the greatest american hero season one,When the dvd arrived I was very excited and then I started watching the first episode and was disappointed because it was not as I remembered when I watched the episode when I was a kid. The first scene seemed to drag on and on and when the exciting parts came on they did not seem as funny.
4,Hubby loved it - mostly.,"Obviously my husband wanted this for nostalgic reasons. Watches his favorite ones over and over, but some of them don't seem as good as they did back in the day."
3,Only 8 episodes,I was a little disappointed that there were only 8 episodes in Season 1. It would be nice if that had been mentioned somehwere prominent.
4,Brings back Memories,"I grew up in the eighties and I love the old eighties tv shows. Watching Greatest American Hero again brings back old times.I would highly recommend anyone who loves this TV show to buy all 3 box sets. Not only to watch it, but to show your kids and the younger generation what the 80's were all about."
1,"never received my order, ""lost in transit"" what's up with that?","Always had great service with Amazon till this order, ordered three items, did the tracking and knew something was wrong when it got ""stuck in Kentucky"", two weeks later Amazon cancelled the order, very disappointed since it was a gift. Will be hesitant to order through them again."
2,4-Letter words,I didn't remember this series had so many bad words. Not recommended for families with young children.
3,"Very cool show, nice picture, song replacement a disaster","I won't be purely vitriolic, the video is fine, the episodes without song replacements are fine, but episodes where the song is ESSENTIAL have had the life tampered out of them -- one is OPERATION SPOILSPORT, where the aliens contact Ralph by playing EVE OF DESTRUCTION on a radio station -- it's been replaced by some lousy 90s sounding wimprock, and it makes no sense (Ralph later tells Bill he heard EVE -- no ya didn't, Ralph!) In CLASSICAL GAS, a silly but fun episode, Ralph's students sing BRASS IN POCKET at a Woodstock type festiveal while he fights crime -- not now -- they've cut ALL frontal shots of Faye Grant singing, and repeated one shot of the back of her head over and over, with a new lame song. Again, many episodes are fine, and some others with song replacements aren't AS ruined as these 2 -- but these 2 (and SPOILSPORT is a fan favorite) are reallllly screwed. Caveat emptor. Long Live Bill Culp, regardless!"
1,Excellent show - cover songs GONE?,"This was one of my favorite shows as a kid and I'm thrilled to finally be able to own it on DVD. However, the powers that be have seen fit to save a few pennies and remove songs that were originally featured in the show. What's worse, the songs removed were not even originals - they were cover songs performed by a different vocalist (Joey Scarbury). I do not see the reason for this, and I do not see the point in you buying an 'altered' set. Find a way to obtain the original thing."
1,"Five stars for the show, 1star for the music edits","I have always loved this show...the special fx may not be groundbreaking (even for the '80s) but the show has a charm all its own.When I bought the season one set, I really didn't notice the music changes...when thinking about season 2, I knew there was one episode that the producers would just HAVE to go the extra mile for ""Operation Spoilsport"" with its INTEGRAL use of the song ""Eve of Destruction"" Needless to say I was outraged to see that the song was indeed replaced with some generic pop drivel that doesn't fit in with the episode and is indeed painful to listen to..Ralph even says the name of the song that's supposed to be playing so it definitely takes you out of the episode.It's making me really question my decision to purchase these sets and make me unsure whether to buy season 3 or, indeed, to sell of seasons 1 and 2."
5,Old Memories,Watched this show many years ago and really enjoyed It. Brings back old memories of the past as do all the great shows that use to be on TV years ago.There will never be another then !
3,The Greatest American Hero - Season One,"What a blast from the past, found this series rather good at the time I first saw it in the 80's as I grew up, watching it this time I found it to be rather disapointing due to the level of voilence, and shooting that was in it, Another example for what the times were like in the 80's"
2,Greatest American Hero-Season 3,"I recently bought season 3 of ""Greatest American Hero."" WHAT'S UP THOUGH WITH THE EPISODES BEING OUT OF ORDER? Ralph and Pam are married in about 3 to 4 episodes (disc 1 & 2) before we actually see the wedding on disc 3. It was disappointing when I started watching the episodes and realized this. I decided to copy the episode guide so I could view the episodes in the right order. The first two seasons released were in the right order; possibly Anchor Bay manufactured season 3 wrong."
4,Ralph and Bill,"I enjoyed this series when it first hit the airwaves. Now I am enjoyhing it again with my children. William Katt was great as Ralph the high flying hero. He taught shcool and saved the world on his free time. Robert Culp has always been one of my favorites and he can play drama and comedy both so very well. The epsiodes were well written, the acting was very good and it came from an age when there was no such animal as a reality series. People were creative then. Ralph was and always will be the Greatest American Hero on TV. Watch and have fun!"
2,Unaudible,"I cannot put into words how disappointed I was with this product. The reason being that once you get passed the first CD's of Orsen Welles' performance all the other CD's are almost completely unaudible. You have to turn the volume up to just be able to make out what they are saying then you have to quickly turn the volume down when the background music begins to play. I purchased some Shadow ""remastered"" CD's about 8 years ago and they were great! I could understand everyone and everything. After wear and tear I needed to replace them so I purchased this product. I do not know what exactly is ""remastered"" with this collection because it sounds horrible and in no way ""remastered.""I would recommend a different collection of The Shadow. I rated this product 2 stars only because I love the Shadow."
5,This watch is gorgous!,"I was so excited when my watch arrived as scheduled. I opened up the box and (WOW) it was so awesome! I took it out and put it on and it looked amazing! The watch looks so much better in person than on the internet. I wear my watch everyday to work and it works great! Love it! You won't be dis-appointed with the Seiko watch, and the price is the best anywhere!"
4,"Alternate title for ""Magic Elements""","Made in BEL in 2001, Serial# PA-775/2, Playing Time 63:53This CD contains exactly the same tracks as ""Magic Elements"", but is pressed in Belgium (on a gold-colored disc). The artwork and liner notes are weak, but if you're looking for a nice collection of CLANNAD material (see my review of ""Magic Elements"" for more details), at a more affordable price, do yourself a favor and grab this edition instead!"
5,Rich Dad stuff is awesome,Any of the material from the Rich Dad series is awesome. Real eye openers.
4,great,I was content with the price and the book was in good condition. overall greatno writings in it just the edges were a little worn out but thats all
2,what the...?,"after trying to read through this needlessly complicated tome of gibberish, the only thing i've learned about stats is to hire an analyst."
1,Useless,"Lots of nice bungalow pictures if that's what you want. Doesn't appear as this book had an editor, so many typos and errors. If you need a book that will help you decide on colors don't waste your money on this one. The color photography although nice, does not come close to matching the actual colors named in the text. On top of that the colors described in the text are often just plain wrong. The Sherwin Williams Color Chips in the book are totally off when compared to the actual color chip card from Sherwin Williams. The icing on the cake is that the book binding was so poor it disintegrated after about a week of limited usage. The good news is, this book is now serving a more suitable role as part of a landfill. What a waste of money."
1,Such inaccuracy from an architectural history specialist!!,"Regional bias, personal preference, oxidized paint chips with no color correction, and a near-absence of sales volume research -- what we get is ineptitude in place of the academic rigor one would expect.Regardless of how user-friendly and 'helpful' readers find it, what good is it if its information is invalid?"
3,"OK, but disappointing photos/examples","As a Craftsman bungalow owner, I was eager to turn to this book for some direction in returning my home's exterior to its period. While there is a good attempt to address some of the questions of color, many of the photos are so poor (harshly contrasting sunlight, faded or inaccurate colors, etc.) that the ""actual"" examples are very disappointing. Further, the best photographed examples are from large A&C homes, not Craftsman, and not ""bungalows,"" as the title implies. However, the color examples provided in the book (in ""chip"" form, rather than from photos) were helpful. In all, I got something from this book, but not as much as I'd hoped."
4,"Nice book, but don't trust the swatches.","While I have to agree that this book was well organized and really fun to look at, I have an issue with the color charts in the back. The colors are way off ( as to be expected when printed), but disappointing anyway. My advice- after exploring the historic color schemes presnted in the book, take a ride down to your local Sherwin Williams paint store and get the paint samples there. They offer a variety of colors - as well as the color swatches presented in this book."
4,What colors should I use?,"Robert Schweitzer's book helped immensely as I was searching for info on what to paint my 1923 Califorrnia Bungalow. I really wanted to stay true to the original intent of the Bungalow movement, and the many authentic swatches of colors gave me lots of ideas. There are loads of examples pictured, with plenty of alternate color choices provided as well. Tremendously informative."
1,NOt very great,"I spent a high price on this toilet and after a month the glue was not all that great and the metal part unhooked. I seriously think your firm should check the quality before pricing. I am upset,very upset because I have been decorating my home and what should have been part of it failed. I thought with the other review someone would contact me and offer some help and nothing. Not very great customer service. I will just try real stores and not online."
3,Average comedy,I was excited to see another Bardot film out on DVD and ordered this before it was released. Though rather entertaining and with a stunning Bardot in her mid 30's looking at her most beautiful self I can't help wondering if it could have been better.The ingredients were certainly there : an alluring Bardot and the great comedian in Annie Girardot. To be fair it was enjoyable enough but it just lacked that extra punch that would have made it better.
3,pretty good cut,"D'Mumblo had a chance at doing something special, especially after his first album,until he made that soggy Wackdoo album also known as ""voodoo"" however on a song like lady you hear a cat with the goods,however he somehow lost that drive despite having the talent. he just mumbled away it seems.bu this was a cool cut."
3,Great Info - Less than Perfect Book - Buy it anyway,George J Bugh should have commissioned someone else to write this work. It lacks flow and often fails to build the knowledge base for what Bugh is attempting to convey. With this being said. The technical detal is astounding and I believe as an engineer George J Bugh is on track. If you have any intrest in Spin Wave's this book is a must but I would much rather have Bugh designing some of the devices and having others write about his success.Note: I Purchased both the CD-Rom and the Text!!!
4,Christmas Carol,To be honest this is the first time I have actually read Christmas Carol. I loved it. The short stories are fun to read also. Will reread each Christmas season. Dickens is wonderful to read. Love how he builds on his characters.
5,Fun to Read,The book has a wonderful selection of stories . Having never actually read 'A Christmas Carol' it was a joy to read it for the first time. Reading it brought back memories of reading Dickens in High School and College. Well worth the purchase price.
2,Pathfinder is low quality dvd,"hi, this review is not for the movie, the movie is 5* for vincent price alone, this review is for the Pathfinder DVD releaseit is both letterboxed and interlaced which results in very low resolution/ quality, its also a single layer DVD which doesnt help either. save your money for a better transfer or an eventual high-def releaseUPDATE: i compared this release with a fullscreen version i have. turns out the widescreen version is actually a cropped version of the fullscreen release!"
5,Art to Color,I bought this book for our daughter for a fun Christmas gift. She loved everything about it and is enjoying the challenge of coloring to match the prints included.
5,completely awesome!,"Art Masterpieces to Color: 60 Great Paintings from Botticelli to Picasso (Dover Colouring Books)this coloring book was purchased at the same time i purchased the one linked below. as i said in my other review, i am an avid fan of coloring to relax and relieve stress. i also found this coloring book on amazon and had to have it! there are 60 pages to complete... i am planning on searching each picture on the internet as i go along and trying to replicate the colors, shading etc.this book is beyond words! i am completely impressed with the intricate details in the pictures! i have not yet colored in it, but i love looking at the drawings! this is going to be quite the project when i start it. this is definitely for older persons who love to color.START EXPLORING(tm) Masterpieces - A Fact-Filled Coloring Book"
4,No Turn On,"this remote works with Aiptek A-HD+, BUT there is no way to turn it on.Why why why? why did they create a remote that does not have the ability to turn on? thats what a remote is for!the most important feature is left out."
2,Typical bootleg quality,"FIRST MOVEMENT - THE BEATLES was also issued on a PHOENIX label 1982 cassette tape (PHX 339).It's a small set of Tony Sheridan tunes recorded by Bert Kaempfert for the German POLYDOR label. The only true Beatles track is the Lennon/Harrison instrumental, ""Cry For a Shadow."" On the rest, just two members play with Sheridan's backup band.Although available in stereo, these are monaural dubs of barely fair fidelity. Not recommended.PROGRAM--SIDE ONECry For a ShadowLet's DanceIf You Love Me BabyWhat'd I SaySIDE TWOSweet Georgia BrownRuby BabyYa-YaWhy Can't You Love Me Again?"
4,Good Book,"I enjoyed reading this book. The author touches subjects that haunt many families, and it also shows how families stick together in times of trouble."
3,Chasing the Impossible Dream,"Mario Piccoli plays a musicologist who is irresistible to woman and chases la grande inconnue all over Paris. I loved the Paris of 30 years ago, the French country side and the vignettes, like Simone Simon as Madam. Piccoli plays a narcissistic man who makes all the woman in this movie look ridiculous and who solves his problems ultimately with sleeping tablets.There are dreams and flash backs which confuse this story of an obsession.You must love veteran actor Piccoli very much to enjoy this DVD."
1,Not useful except for specialists,I was disappointed with this book; the pinyin index is of little value because it does not correspond to the Dover 1923 edition of Karlgren's dictionary. Best to try to get a used copy of the original Dover edition that analyzes the characters by phonetic groups which is really the interesting point of the work to an amateur sinologist like myself. The Dover edition also has an index according to the Chinese radicals and English translations.
3,It is Alright,"I essentially agree with what the book says and found it to contain some helpful advice. I just didn't feel like it was very masterfully written. It explored the subject matter, but didn't seem to be anything other than run-of-the-mill"
4,"NICE for the Price, but a little Dark","They are very nice stones for the price. However, they are a lot dark in person, almost black in color. But you can see the blue in Bright light."
1,Horrible!,This is the second order of the same thing. When I spoke to Amazon CSR regarding the first order not having the earrings in the box they refunded my money. Then talked me into ordering again... Well this time time I got earrings that look like I bought them from Claire's - Unbelievable!I would never consider this KATARINA shop ever again.
3,TOO DARK,"Way to dark for me, I am just using them now with my winter colors. They are darker then the blue of the picture. I have had these for sometime now. Maybe I will get used to them??"
4,Dora's reviews,"I like these ear rings; however, they weren't quite as big as I thought they would be. The color is nice and they do shine brightly."
2,Diamond earrings,"This was embarrassingly small. I thought I knew what half of a half-carat looked like, but the picture of this product made the earrings look bigger than they turned out to be be. Makes my wife's 1-carat ring look absolutely HUGE in comparison. I told her that I'd thoroughly understand if she never put them on. Goes to show ya -- you get what you pay for. I shoulda known. It'd be much cheaper to buy earrings with cut glass, and nobody cold tell the difference."
3,"Wife liked them, I thought they were too small.","Pretty, but small. Like really small. Typical guy, I should have realized I wasn't getting gigantic rocks for 150ish bucks, but I didn't. Anyway. Like I said, pretty."
4,Good deal,After reading the other reviews I was a little worried about the quality but very happy with the purchase. Even though they are I1 rated I didn't see any visible flaws. Also the size was perfect. The reason for the 4 stars is because the color is not like the picture but that was expected. Color is more teal than blue.
3,Size differential,"I was initially disappointed with the size-they were not exactly as pictured and upon first inspection, seemed too small. But"
4,Truly Beauties!,"These are very nice blue diamonds! The picture does show more of a blue, but these are more of a blue/green like the ocean, which is more true to the blue diamond. If you want a BLUER...you should look at sapphires. I got these to match a blue diamond ring I purchased while in St. Thomas....now to find a necklace to complete! Nicely packaged. If you want nice blue diamonds for a good price, give these a try!"
3,Don't buy if you are a lefty,Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She is a lefty and the safety switch is not made for a lefty. She couldn't operate it without it being a hassle.
1,Poorly designed and dangerous product,I would not recommend this product to anyone. I bought 2 of these as Christmas presents(wife and daughter). We have owned many different brands of electric knives through the years and this is the absolute worst I have ever seen. The main problem is that it takes all your strength to force the blades into out or out of the proper cutting position in the knife. I little slip and you could be missing a finger or at least require stitches. The other problem is the lock mechanism. It is spring loaded in the off position. In order to press the trigger you must use your other hand to push in the lock each time you start a cut which is not at all practical. I am returning both of these knives before someone requires an emergency room visit.
1,Worst Piece of Junk I ever Bought,"I went cheap on this, I admit it, but it is manufactured by Black and Decker whose products I have never had a problem with so I took a chance. First time I tried to use it, the housing for the blades stripped out. I was only cutting bread with it. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this knife. The quality of this knife has absolutely nothing to do with the wonderful service that I receive from amazon.com."
2,Worked fine for a few times then broke,"Sorry, but after only a few uses the knife quit working. It makes a buzzing sound when touched to the bread but won't cut."
4,great knife,We had to replace our 29 year old B&D knife so I figured I should replace it with the same. Hopefully this one will give us the same service.
2,Shreds meat more than you want,"I've had this for a year and a half now and it's not the knife I'd reach for first. Poultry gets a micro-shred cut and large cuts of beef are difficult to cut uniformly thin. Better off with a 12"" slicer."
2,performance,After the first few slices of a pork tender the blades seemed to gum up and I had to use a back and forth sawing motion to continue slicing at a very slow pace. Not a satisfactory item.
1,Tossing after using twice,"After about 10 years my Hamilton Beach knife stopped working. While it did a good job was hoping to find a replacement that was easier to use when my hands were slippery. This looked like it would fit the bill as it has the rubber grip on top. After using it twice, or rather trying to and then just resorting to a carving knife, I am throwing this away. As others have mentioned there is too big a gap between the blades and it ends up shredding the meat. But, most importantly, the trigger is terrible. There is no way to depress it easily and cut your meat safely. Maybe I just have a defective one but both my husband and I could not use it easily. Not chancing it, or wasting more money on another, so into the trash it goes and I'll buy another Hamilton Beach."
2,Black & Decker Electric Knife,I opened this Christmas present on Christmas Eve so I could carve the turkey. The locked blades came apart twice when carving the first half of turkey. I gave up and will not use again.Black and Decker Home Slice Right Electric Knife EK700
2,disappointed,"Just OK, prior one we own works better for slicing the brisket I make, this knife worked fine on the Thanksgiving turkey. It is just not sturdy enough to tackle the brisket. that has been cooked, then refrigerated, then needs to be sliced before being heated in the gravy."
1,Zero Stars!,"I purchased this electric knife for the sole purpose of slicing loaves of homemade bread; nothing too demanding. After having it less than 3 weeks, and about 6 loaves of bread later, it just all together quit working in the middle of cutting a loaf. What junk!"
1,Difficult to use,"My son a professional chef used this to attempt to carve the Turkey,it was hard to ,hold in palm of hand.trying to hold in button and carve was awkward in his hand.The blades kept disengaging from unit.He finally thru it in the sink and used a carving knife.Told us to get rid of it and he would bring his own the next time."
2,Black and Decker electric knife,This item was supposed to arrive WITH a storage case. It did not. There is no protection form the edge of the knife blades for storage. The knife had trouble cutting through a heavy bread crust. I really liked the previous mod of this knife (ERGO). There must be better electric knives in the market place...Vic Kritz
2,Didn't work for what I needed,"I bought this electric knife specifically to cut high density foam for upholstering some dining room chairs. It was so disappointing that it didn't work at all - cut was very slow and ragged, knife got stuck in foam and basically wasn't the precise cut I was looking for. I ended up doing a very rough cut way outside the lines and then fine-tuning the cut with my husband's band saw which worked perfectly. I should have asked what kind of electric knife they used at the fabric store for cutting foam...theirs worked quite well."
5,Finding Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior Gives Power for Living,"Knowing Jesus Christ can be as simple as receiving Him personally as your Lord and Savior. Without Him there is no power for Living, not only the Christian life, but the overcoming life in a lost confused world of a fallen creation.This book explains simply the direction a person seeking the truth can follow. Along with this simple direction are examples of historical people who share their support for the power that will come when truly believing in Jesus Christ as the only path to an eternal life of value. A life with the Son of God. He said, ""I go to prepare a place for you...""That you can be there with Jesus Christ makes this book a valued source to verify a testimony of evidence both Biblical and personal from historical witnesses and scriptural truths related in simple format for a new believer or seeker of truth."
2,Ho hum,"This book is a good Christian-oriented elaboration on certain points of the Bible, with short bios of eight people who were well-known or popular at one time, each of whom were Christians (and presumably still are). Roger Staubach, the quarterback, was one. Charles Colson, the Nixon associate, was another.But the inclusion of these eight people, of course, dates the book. Young people would not be familiar with any of them.Otherwise, what you find here is a pretty straight shot from the Bible, not too much different than other Christian-oriented books.Some people may find answers to their problems in this book, that is, ""power for living."" I didn't. I hate to sound uppity, but I guess I need something with a little more cachet. A Course in Miracles, for example, which one reviewer called ""religion for intellectuals,"" which is true in one sense. It's actually a mystical Christianity.Diximus."
2,Poor history,"I agree with the previous review. The historical narrative jumps around distractedly and Ms. Schrader seems to have personal bad feelings towards Jacqueline Cochrane for some reason. Even the illustrations are not new and the people in them are left unidentified. The captioning is meagre. One can find the same pictures in other books complete with the identity of each person. My personal recommedation is Sally Keil's book, ""Those Wonderful Women in Their Flying Machines"". Though it is now thirty years old, her history seems more objective, the time line is presented in a generally linear way and the photographs, many that reappear in the Schrader book, are adequately captioned."
1,Retired professor,"Revisionist history at its worst! Very superficial treatment of the subject. Full of minor but annoying historical innaccuracies. The book is basically a rehash of three or four secondary sources. Only thing new is constant formulation of biased conclusions,the support for which are things taken out of context from other authors. The author's predisposition seems to be that all things British were good,while all things American were bad. There are excellent books that have been written on the WAFS, WASP, and the ATA, but this certainly is not one of them."
5,Boney M is timeless,Wow what a great cover.Again a new compilation of Boney M and a good track listing.Boney M music is just timelessThe proof new compilation releases always again.Also the track listing on this cd is the track listing that was chosen bye the LIZ MITCHELL FAN CLUB on an earlier release for the cd 25 jaar na Daddy Cool ore The Ultimate Collection...
1,Bad Design,The shells are sealed so when one light goes out they all go out. You have to take them all apart to find the one that went out to replace the burnt out light...pour design.
3,"Useable, but flimsy","This spinning organizer is laid out well, but is fairly flimsy and once it is loaded with all your stuff it doesn't spin very well. Not recommended for anything heavy or very tall."
1,Unsatisfactory,"The one I receiived was missing something on the bottom.It wobbled and was defective. Had to return if for a refund.F.Flores-Honolulu, HI.Rubbermaid desk organizer"
4,Good but......,"Good thick Balsamic, but a little 'contrived' tasting. This one is more acidic than I was expecting from something like this. I also has a somewhat 'cooked' character. It's not bad and we are enjoying it but for the same price get the Villa Manodori Balsamic Vinegar."
1,Not good,"Been sampling a lot of different balsamic vinegars lately and didn't care much for this one at all. It has a bitter, unpleasant tone. Definitely would not purchase this one again."
3,Not exactly the item pictured.,"The bottle in the picture shows the 12 year aged balsamic (notice the 12 Roman numerals around the neck label of the bottle). The one being sold here is the 6 year aged balsamic, as the text states."
5,Brings Thailand to life,Thailand is a country with many faces and Moore is an artist who paints fascinating portraits. Though I am generally not a fan of deceive stories I am hooked on Moore's Calvino series. Moore has very intriguing way of commenting on life through his characters. Cold Hit is definitely one of Moore's finer works.
4,Tear Jerker,"No Longer Mine was riveting, and I could not put it down. Ms. Gage keeps the reader on their seat, twisting the characters just enough to make you question the ending. No Longer Mine follows Wade and Nikki through all aspects of a relationship-anger, betrayal, loss, and reconciliation.No Longer Mine is a prequel to Her Best Friend's Lover (Shiloh Walker), and fits the puzzle pieces together."
2,bluetooth dongle,"unfortunately, i could not get this item to work?i was trying to wirelessly connect to my nokia cellphone,but it didnt happen."
1,Not pleased with this item,"I ordered this item and a similar dongle made by Asus (I have 2 computers) and wanted to compare the dongles. Although my system recognized this one immediately when plugged in to a usb port, it refused to identify my Bluetooth wireless headphones, and after hours of fiddling and piddling it still doesn't work. The ASUS unit (USB-BT211) COMES WITH A SOFTWARE MIMI CD. After installing the supplied software, I plugged in the dongle, it was immediately recognized by the system, the headphones were immediately identified, everything was running within an hour and working perfectly. I'll probably just order another Asus dongle and throw this one in the trash. CONFIRMED - You get what you pay for."
1,Comes with eval software w/2MB limit. More $$ for real SW,Comes with evaluation software that is way back rev. with 2MB transfer limit. Have to sign up on Engrish website to download newer version of EVAL software. More money for the real software. Could not pair with Microsoft Bluetooth mouse on WinXP. Not worth the hassle.
2,Compatibility issues!,"I'm not denying. It works. But in a strange way. transfer files ok. The software include has a 5Mb limitation. after that, surprise!!!, we have to PAY to get the full support. Have compatibility issues with: Windows XP x64 Professional, Vista x64 and Windows 7 while comunicating with Samsung New PC Studio (Samsung and IVT Corp did'nt solve this problem). Sad."
3,Linux problems,"Works great with windows 7 but when tested with ubuntu freezes the entire operating system, I have been using linux since 4 years and is the first time the whole system freezes when trying to add a new bluetooth device (motorola s305 bluetooth headphones). Coincidence?"
2,Don't waste your money,"I have always used aluminum cake pans and love them, but my husband bought this for me thinking it'd be just as good. NOT!! I used a shiney baking sheet (as was recommended) to put the pan on while baking AND used a lower temp (325 degrees) and the bottom of my cake was burnt!!! I am not happy with this pan and do not recommend anyone buying this unless you want to use it for a jello mold or candy mold. I'll spend a little extra on an aluminum pan ANY DAY!"
4,Smaller than I expected,Over all I was pleased with this product. Being that it is made of plastic I wasn't sure If I would like it. The cake popped right out of this pan easily. The other cake I made that day in an alluminum pan stuck. I was a bit surprised how small it is. It doesn't quite fit a whole cake mix in it.
5,awesome,this cake pan is awesome. i like it alot. i was glad to see that some one sold a turkey cake pan i have been looking for one for a long time and know i finally got one.
3,Wanted this to be awesome!,Too flimsy in my opinion because it's made out of some type of plastic. I bought this years ago off another site & I've used it only twice because it loses its shape the more you use it. Can't anyone make a metal coffin-shaped cake pan????The two cakes I made turned out pretty well considering the pan loses its shape.~
3,Volume One doesn't mean Season One,"Caution!!! Volume One of The Time Tunnel is not the same as Season One which I did not noticed. Earlier, when I bought Flipper, it was the whole Season One. They both came with 4 DVDs but The Time Tunnel is only a half season. I wasn't happy with the price when I found that out."
5,"Oh, how I wish this series would have lasted longer -",I was in awe every time this show came on - loved the futuristic theme and the whole idea of time travel. A must if you are a sci-fi fan.
4,The Time Tunnel Experience,"I watched the DVD with my son, who is 12 years old and he loved it as much as i did. I did not know it was in color because i had a black and white TV when the show was on. Thanks for a blast from the past. Sci Fi geeks will like this."
5,Must see TV,"As I watched as an 8 year-old, I knew this was interesting then. Now watching these episodes again, I really enjoy the shows even more. What a great way to show this generation about some things that happened in world history! Anybody that watched this as a kid will really enjoy these episodes."
3,Not bad but not as good as I remembered,"When I learned that The Time Tunnel was coming out on DVD, I was trilled. I remember in 1966, when I was 15, I thought it was television at it's best. Time travel has always been my favorite story line and that is what this was every week. I wouldn't miss it. When I bought the DVD set, I immediately sat down and watched several episodes. Good but suffers from being made in the 60's and everything hokey that comes with it. But you know, I still bought Volume 2. Boy I wish someone would remake this show with a little 21st century sophistication. Just don't center it around sex instead of time travel please."
3,"OK veiwing, good value","You know how sometimes you remember things from your childhood and they always seem fantastic looking back, but when you revisit them sometimes it is a bit a let down? That is what the Time Tunnel was. I remember watching it as a kid, and loving it. The effects, the time travel, it was superb. And then it was never, ever replayed on New Zealand TV. So I bought this DVD of the first series. It's still quite enjoyable, but not as much as when I was 10! The acting is terrible (and that is being kind). The story lines are weak, and the effects are dodgy. But as I say, an enjoyable enough watch for a rainy afternoon."
3,TV Sci-Fi Cheese,"Let's put it this way: the first fifteen minutes of the first episode are the best of the run. I still love to watch the command car disappear under the desert and it's still fun to look down 800 stories into the earth. After that, it's typical Irwin Allen tedium. A little greasepaint and glitter and there's your alien. The wonders of the world explored with a trunkload of period costumes and a couple of cheesy sets. I was twelve when these episodes first appeared and, truth be told, they were pretty tedious even back then. I remember hoping that next week's episode would be better than the one I just watched.I have the most fun watching for the flashing light control panels that seem to make the rounds from Time Tunnel to Lost in Space to Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea to Land of the Giants. The guy really gets his money's worth from the props department. Any other pleasures derive stictly from nostalgia."
5,THIS SHOW IS ADDICTIVE!,"I use to watch this show when they had re-runs of it on regular tv... after buying the DVD recently I loved watching it now more than ever!If you haven't purchased it, you don't know what your missing!"
4,Time Tunnel Volume 1,"Entertaining,I found that its view of what had happened in history interesting. There are things that are not historically factual but the general thrust of the show does put one there. Definately worth having especially if you have anyone in your home from grades 4 to adult. The television sets leave much to the imagination (which I found refreshing) so even if there was no interaction it left you thinking."
3,1st season ripoff,"I couldn't wait for Time Tunnel to come out on DVD. But because the show only ran for one season, for reasons that can only be about makimg money, they are splitting season one and making us fans buy 2 volumes when they easilier could have put the entire season into one package. For that reason alone, I will not buy it. Don't rip us off!"
2,NOT COMPLETED,"I purchased Time Tunnel vol 1. Get very disappointed as the movie are not complete as what they wrote in the cover.From 15 episodes that should be there, The DVD I received only have 9 episodes (where is the other 9 episodes gone to??). Also none ""Feature"" that shown are available on the DVD."
1,VERY POOR JOB,WHOEVER CAME OUT WITH THESE DID A VERY POOR JOB. ANYBODY CANDIVIDE THE TOTAL RUNNING TIME BY THE NUMBER OF EPISODES AND REAL-IZE THAT THESE EPISODES ARE NOT FULL LENGTH. 20TH CENTURY FOX ORWHOEVER BROUGHT THESE OUT OWES THE BUYERS AN APOLOGY !
2,Days of Future ... passed,"I recalled this show as being spectacular, enthralling, mesmerizing ... I was also thirteen years old when it aired. Honoring my memory, I recently watched several episodes on late-night cable tv. I saw an old, cheesy, severely dated show frought with cold-war hysteria, a relic from a time when might made right, when minorities were rarely allowed on the tube. Why, the ""futuristic"" episode I veiwed was down-right hysterical, but for all the wrong reasons. So far as I am now concerned, my memory suffers from a deceided lack of credibility. There is one thing, however, I failed to notice with my thirteen-year-old eyes, that did not escape my more mature, sophisticated self. Lee Merriweather sure had a great set of legs!!!"
2,...Kinda Outta Time...tick...tick...tick...,"This show was a great adventure series for its' time (wise crack # 1), but it's only a sense of nostalgia. I don't think I could bear to watch the series today. The primitive excuses for technology alone will remind me of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. Spray painted cardboard boxes with Christmas lights and toggle swtiches. Geeezzzz! Besides, as another reviewer noted, ""why did they always find themselves at a crucial turning point in history and not just in someone's backyard barbecue?"" Ratings aside that is. Well, it sure to a lot of time (#2) to get this DVD set out. I just don't see young people going out in droves to buy these discs."
5,Irwin Allen was a master,"The time Tunnel was Irwin Allen's most abstact and interesting series.First it features the theoretical physics notion of backward time travel.As always in Irwin's productions,special effects are state of the art and comparev with comtemporary programming.Casting is great.In all an engaging example of first class series production."
3,TV memories,"I remember this fondly. It ran on Friday nights on ABC, for a single season, in 1966-67. I was in second grade, and there was no school the next day, so I could stay up and watch. (Interesting side note--the night before the first episode aired on September 9, 1966, another science-fiction show debuted on NBC--Star Trek.) The show itself was pretty corny, and full of inconsistencies--Doug and Tony had no qualms about changing history with their actions in the past, which would have screwed up everything for the future. The pilot episode sports an electric-bulb chandelier aboard the Titanic in 1912! (In a later episode, the geniuses who run the incredibly trouble-prone Tunnel send an MP with a submachine gun back to ancient Troy!) Those clothes Doug and Tony wore must have begun to smell pretty bad after awhile! Still, to a seven-year-old, the intellectual level at which this show is aimed, great stuff."
4,Video is good but be prepared for the hidden episodes,"The Time Tunnel video is good, however unless you are aware of the 2 hidden eppisodes on the other side of the second disk, it appears that you were shorted these episodes that are shown on the outside of the case."
1,LOVE THE SHOW...........HATE THE PERSON THAT RELEASED ONLY HALF THE EPISODES OF A SHOW THAT RAN ONLY ONE SEASON?????????,How money hungry is the company? The show was only on for one season! Why release only half of it now? Hasn't the public waiting long enough for this show to come on DVD??? Do you really have to stretch it out?????
3,TIME TUNNEL VOL 1,MY WIFE LIKED IT BUT I DIDN'T CARE FOR SOME OF THE EPISODES WHERE THEY INCLUDED ALIENS
2,Misleading,"We bought this book for my 3rd grader. He was planing on using it as an autobiography. The book was told in a story format and was only about Walt Disney's childhood. I sent the book in to school for the teachers approval and she agreed with my assesment and we had to choose another book. From the description, we understood it differently."
1,"Sizing good for up to 10"" Planter - not 12.5"" as described","This measures 11.25"" across and much of that is unusable due to the lip of the tray. As of this review, the description of the product indicates this can hold a 12.5"" planter which is incorrect. Also interesting... the SKU on the bottom of the product claims it's 12.5""... which it isn't... it's 11.25"". Very Odd.Lastly, this is incredibly cheap, thin plastic... might weigh 2-3 ounces. It would work for a planter at 10"" but even so it's such a cheap product it's not worth more than a few bucks in my opinion."
2,Small wrist dont buy,I have a small wrist and this just falls off. I couldn't find any store that would take the links out without me spending more than I paid for the bracelet. My bad for assuming it would fit.
1,Should a comedy album feature pity laughter?,"Do you remember the guy in high school or college who tried to be the class clown but failed miserably? Well, Eugene Mirman is less entertaining than that guy.I'm not being sarcastic about the pity laughter... that's the most laughter here, and yes, this was recorded live. How the record company heard this and still felt comfortable releasing it is beyond me. Perhaps it's a tax write-off."
2,"Not Larry the Cable Guy, but not Louis C.K., either","Mirman's greatest flaw isn't that he's unoriginal or banal (both of which, unfortunately, he is), but it's that his delivery sounds like that guy you knew in college who would elongate or emphasize certain words to try to be funnier, but alas, it never worked out well. He's just unbearable to listen to. The kind of voice ""witty"" internet commenters have when they read their own jokes."
1,Disappointing.,"Emulating a famous individual rarely works for a writer wanting to create his own magic. This book fails on all counts. It is as woeful as anything I've read in the past 10 years. It is a Publish-On-Demand book (I.E. VANITY) and it shows. SORRY, BUT THIS IS A BAD, BAD BOOK."
4,Mixed feelings,"Although I found the characters somewhat flat and frankly disliked a couple of them such as Kerry, I thoroughly enjoyed being transported to Joe's and Jay's gardens and homes and -- through Harris' magical pen -- found myself believing in those ""talking"" wine bottles as living things. On the whole, I enjoyed the process of getting to the denouement, but felt somewhat disappointed at the way the plot ends were all tied up on the last few pages. I got hooked on Harris with her Gentlemen and Players and, though I didn't feel Blackberry Wine was quite up to the standard of the former, I still have a bunch of her other books stacked on my nightstand ready to be read."
4,blackberry wine,excellent!--- if you liked 'chocolat' its more of the magic--in fact some of the characters and events from 'chocolat' are mentioned in 'blackberry wine'
3,Served it's purpose,"I enjoyed the book. I needed it for a book club selection. Decent delivery timing, but, while reading it, the pages started to separate from the spine."
2,Don't bother,"I did not feel this book at all. It falls so flat--everything might as well be a cardboard cut-out--that it's hilarious the main character is a celebrated writer. The structure of the story should work: a man living off his waning fame as the author of a celebrated novel leaves his prominence, and his leeching girlfriend, for a small village in France, hoping to recapture his inspiration and find some answers about his past.Harris fails to deliver in all respects. The novel reads like a first draft, and I wish she'd realized her mistake and threw the manuscript in the fireplace. In light of character Jay's decision at the end and how it must reflect on Harris, you wonder why she even bothered in the first place. With Jay, Harris barely manages to creat a character more talented and wise than she is.Absolutely terrible. Extra star for sustained effort."
2,Fomulaeic,"This was a choice of my bookclub so I dutifully plowed my way through it. My main beef with this novel is how totally cliched her characters are - especially the minor ones - the bluff general of a grandfather, the rich and famous father with the supermodel and so on - they are like cardboard cut outs stuck in with so little thought. Even the main characters who are fleshed out a little more just dont hold together well enough to be anywhere near believeable - I just didnt CARE what happened to them.There are some redeeming features to the book - I very much enjoyed the gardening folklore and the home remedies. Also the story flowed at a reasonable pace so it wasnt too onerous a task getting through it. But at the end of it I felt it was a totally forgettable book without any of the magic promised by the cover's blurb. Its not a horrible book - its just nothing special."
2,It just didn't work for me,"I loved Chocolat and the Lollipop Shoes and had just finished the even better Five Quarters of the Orange when I picked up Blackberry Wine. Unlike the others, this was a real struggle to get through. The characters seemed shallow and one-dimensional, as though they needed more work. The plot didn't really develop until well into the novel (it didn't start to get in the least bit interesting until about two thirds of the way in) and even then, it was weak. I think that one of the biggest mistakes was to set it in the same village as Chocolat, making vague references to the events of that novel and giving some of the characters cameos in this one. While I am glad that I made it to the end, this is one book I won't be reading again."
5,What a wonderful second novel by Joanne Harris!,Blackberry Wine is warm and sweet. Sweet like her Chocolat. This novel offers a chance to revisit Lansquenet and the dig into the mysteries the village holds. Having enjoyed Harris' Chocolat I was anxious to read her new novel and have only found that I am anxious to read more. This was fun. A romp through the garden. This book was as welcome a summer read as a good glass of wine!
2,Not tasty,"Even though I like Joanne Harris' writing, this book alienated me completely. Do not expect the secrets and magic of ""Chocolat"" or the mystery and beauty of ""Five Quarters of the Orange"". This one is a flat, uninteresting romance. It is full of cliche, the characters are incomplete and unreal, almost stereotyped (the quintessential lonely author looking for magic in his life, the mysterious widow etc.), and the flashbacks in every two pages are tiring and do not allow the reader to enjoy the plot. I couldn't keep it going. I read Five Quarters after that, and I found it much better. Skip ""Blackberry Wine"", it just isn't worth it."
2,perhaps.....,"Perhaps Joanne Harris had a hard time identifying with a male perspective. Perhaps the only topic she knows is the magical and medicinal attributes of herbs and plants. Perhaps she had her own 'Nick' (a minor in this novel, Nick is the pushy publishing rep who tries to convince the main character, Jay, to hurry his follow up novel through the presses). Who knows? But this book just didn't have the panache of ""Five Quarters of the Orange"" and ""Chocolat"". The plot struggles at times and characters from the other novels make cameos with no apparent purpose other than to remind the reader that this book is by the same author. Sigh. Just like Peter Mayle, Joanne Harris has strong sophmore efforts that are well worth reading but seems to fall flat in this subsequent attempt. If you haven't yet read ""Five Quarters..."", I would highly recommend it for it's complex yet well crafted storylines. If you've already read it, read it again and pass on ""Blackberry Wine""."
3,Underwhelmed...,"Characters, a potential romance and story line are substantially underdeveloped. Skip this one (and skip Gentlemen & Players) and move to ""Chocolat"" and ""Five Quarters of the Orange."""
2,Ho hum!,"After reading and watching Chocolat, I expected an equally delightful book with lovely characters. This book had dull characters, with whom one could hardly sympathize, a homely setting of no charm at all, and a dull plot, which only became interesting once the neighbor started talking to Jay; too little, too late. The alternating flashback chapters were so horribly useless as background material, I read them quickly, only to find myself bored once again by the tiresome plot of silly Jay and his shallow life among the not-quite-eccentrics of his French village. Pity!"
1,Blackberry Wine Bore,"This book entirely missed the mark for me, which was a shame as I had really enjoyed her earlier work ""Chocolat"", in this case I felt that the character of Jay Mackintosh and several of the other cast were completely boring and stereotypical, even his early years as a adolescent with the ubiquitous bully boys and his 'saviour' Joe, divorcing parents and elderly disinterested grand parents left me unmoved...."
2,Quick read-not much else,"My mom left this book at my house.So I thought...""Hey, free book.""If you read quickly and frequently you should go ahead and give this a try.If you are a slow reader. . .spend your time on something with more substance.After a fairly long drawn-out story with little humor and not much suspense I was surprised to find the final chapters to be reasonably satisfying.Hence the two stars.But I assure you there is zero ""kung-fu"" in this one."
4,Just the Facts Ma'am,This effort historically speaking will fill you in on just about everything you need to know about what it was for the two sides mostly between the British and their rightly take that bombing would be least painful to be conducted at night and the German effort to stop them (mostly playing catch up) which came about because of the night raids early on that the Germans did on England and Bomber Commands counter-measures which in turn gave it back to 'em in spades.
4,"good, not great","Some excellent points made. The author, however, like most, was too much theoryand not enough fact. Some time in the future, after extremists, both left and right, arereplaced with analysts not tied to philosophical nonsense handicapping currentpolitical writing, we will read analysis based on the wealth of National Archive andpresidential library information available.It is necessary, of course, to peel away the historical garbage inserted to justify actscommitted by the hot and Cold War victors. It will then become painfully obvious thatwe already live in a Totalitarian Democracy. The Republic died no later that 0800 hours,Pearl Harbor time, December 7, 1941."
3,Not a bad read.,"The book is dated, simplistic, and draws inaccurate and incomplete conclusions which is probably due to the fact that life is generally never that simplistic. Nonetheless, it contains a lot of great observations about human nature and power.Reviews seem to go to either extremes unnecessarily. Can one honestly and readily dismiss it if the person wants to have a more accurate well-rounded view on reality? I don't think so. On the other extreme, is his theory accurate and that simplistic? Not to me. Does the book contain a lot of truisms and valid observations? I think yes.I would warn those who feel it necessary to tie off the loose ends or feel the need of having some simplistic unifying theory to explain reality on such a simplistic plane. That can be just as dangerous in sociology as it is in science as history as shown.This book is worth the read, perhaps not a purchase but certainly through the local library."
2,NOT THE ACTUAL BOOK,The book I ordered off of this amazon page for C. Wright Mills' Power Elite was actually a collection of essays by sociologists on C. Wright Mills' Power Elite. Make sure you get that straight before you order.
4,Bottom Up Democracy Still Matters,"This book is very interesting, but the argument might be a bit overstated. Even with elite structures, bottom up democracy has had a place in American life since the country was founded. This is worth a read and also a good deal of individual thought."
1,Bed Time Story,"This author has obviously never spent time talking to the people he pretends to be describing!?!?! His claims at knowing what moderate Americans think are spurious at best. By his views, anyone who is proud of America and the ideals most of its citizens espouse are mistaken. Apparently he is for ""stamping out"" this country's past and traditions and replacing it with something ""new and shiny""!?!?!?!? Too bad that trees were destroyed for the paper used in this book."
5,The Power Elite,The seller was very honest in the book's description and the book itself still holds up 50 years after it was written.
5,Still Correct after 50 Years,"C. Wright Mills was a prophet without honor during his lifetime.Rereading this work after almost 50 years should be a wake-up call to arms against those forces who seek to control our nation for their, not our benefit."
4,This is a refreshing .....,This book is an inspiration to those of us who understand that to buiid a better society we require the participation of all of its citizens.
3,Not a page turner. More like literary granola,"I first read C. Wright Mills' The Power Elite as a sociology student in the 70s. This is a densely written analysis of the intersecting circles of military brass, professional politicians, and corporate executives. It is particularly germane in our current economic crisis and the leadership vacuum that led us here.Make another pot of coffee. It'll keep you awake in the really slow spots. Otherwise, the more thought-provoking chapters will have you seething with anger and outrage. And the bad thing is, we allow it to happen.Enjoy."
3,finicky,"Once you get the hang of it, this coffee maker works okay. I did a couple of overflows before I sorted out the details. Don't overfill the filter with coffee. Make sure the top of the carafe is on correctly and that it lines up with the drip thing above. My biggest complaint is that a piece of the plastic hinge on the swing-out filter basket broke. I simply put it back where it used to be attached and it all seems okay, but the machine should be more rugged. I have the feeling the machine's life span will be shorter than I'd hope. Coffee is very good, but could be a tad hotter. The carafe is fine. I felt it was worth the discount price for the refurbished model. But for more than $50, you can probably do better."
2,"Overflows easily, pieces broke","I was very excited about this product - saving on electricity was a biggie for me. The quality of the coffee was good, but as noted by another reviewer, the machine is finicky. It overflowed a number of times, I'm not sure why. I changed to a paper filter, instead of the gold plate permanent one, and that helped some, although didn't completely eliminate the overflow problem. The piece that is at the bottom of the filter holder broke within four months. It was not fixable at home. Without it the water flowed too fast through the coffee and into the carafe and it was very weak. I give the carafe four stars! Very good, holds the heat well. I've thrown away the brewer and now pour the coffee brewed from another cheapo coffee maker into the carafe and it stays hot, tasting good for a couple of hours."
5,Very worthwhile purchase,"We've been using this product daily for 3 weeks and it operates perfectly and we awaken to wonderful-tasting coffee. For the price of the remanufactured product, it simply can't be beat as it is as good of quality as though it were brand new. We're glad we chose this brand."
5,What's not to like?,I almost didn't order this because of a couple of bad reviews. But the price was so good I had to give it a try. (I saw the same coffeemaker at Kohl's yesterday. It would have cost me 4 times what I paid for mine!)It makes coffee just the way I like it and keeps it hot for hours-8 hours and counting today. Still hot and tastes fresh.You just need to take a little care when closing the filter door and setting the carafe under it. Not a big deal. I suspect user carelessness and not malfunction was the main reason these coffeemakers were returned.I have some trouble reading newsprint without glasses but I didn't have any trouble seeing the timer. Maybe my lighting is better?I didn't order the gold filter so I can't comment on that.If you get another chance to buy one of these don't hesitate.
3,Not quite smooth,"I love a lot of Bob James smooth jazz, and this cd has that, but it also has more of the funk jazz that I am not crazy about. The music like the start of the ""Taxi"" show (Angela's Theme) is the type of sound I was looking for. Not a bad cd, but not all I was looking for."
4,Great CD but one fave missing,"Bob James is a musical chameleon and I have enjoyed his music for years. He's one of the most ""in demand"" keyboardist, arranger, etc. of the last 30 years. This collection is an admirable project but my heart was broken when I discovered that ""Unicorn"" was not one of the tracks included. How could this have happened? Anybody who has listen to this track from James' ""Sign Of The Times"" CD knows that this track is completely mesmerizing, especially with Spyro Gyra's Jay Beckenstein sax work heavily featured. This omission leaves me puzzled."
2,It was okay at first...,"It worked well for the couple months since I got it: isolated sound well in a loud environment, decent sound quality, came with three different ear size covers, and was generally a good deal for the price...except for the fact that today one of the earbuds stopped working! Now I only have sound in one ear after only a few months? Even if this isn't exactly a ton of money, it should still last out the year. Time for some new ear buds(from a different company of course)."
2,"Excellent Sound, SHORT LIFE SPAN","Bought a pair and I was amazingly surprised at the quality of sound receiving from a sub $30 ear buds. However, it has a short life span. The left earbud tends to short as as reported by many users. Otherwise, it would've been 5 stars."
1,Defective,"Either this was a fake pair or I was sent a broken pair. The packaging want even correct; they came in a small zip lock bag instead of a plastic case. I've owned these same headphones before so I knew what asking quality to expect and these were awful. The sound quality was nothing like it was supposed to be. I returned them, got a refund, and then just ordered the headphones through the creative labs website."
3,Seems to be a knock-off,"I tried these as soon as they arrived at my door, and they came in as a packet and not a box. The sound quality is very average, and the ""L"" and ""R"" are reversed, as tested with an equalizer. They do produce great bass though."
4,Much better than the ear buds that are bundled with the iPod,I bought these to use with my iPod Touch. The ear buds that come with Apple products are uncomfortable to wear and I was never impressed with the sound. The EP-630 headphones are comfortable to wear and they have a decent sound for their size. The only drawback was that they have a tendency to get tangled up. I have learned to wrap them up carefully to avoid the tangles.
4,"good earbuds, good price","I'm happy with these earbuds. Most earbuds don't fit my very narrow ear canals. These fit well, though they create some pressure which is slightly uncomfortable though tolerable. The result of the seal is that it keeps out nearly all outside sound. This allows me to listen without turning the volume up, and that's good for my ears. The sound reproduction is good and pleasant, though the bass is rather lacking. The price is a lot better than the high-end earbuds, so overall, I'm quite satisfied. It's a good compromise among comfort, sound, and price. I recommend these earbuds."
3,Not Bad,"I bought these headphones 3 months ago, and the sound quality is alright,not great.It isolates a lot of noise and has a good price. but this is the third pair i have had to get because one ear would stop working after a month...If you have better luck then i do then you will be satisfied with these earbuds"
3,Average,"Sound is okay, very tinny and distant. I also have a pair of Shure earphones: three times the cost, but a much, much better sound."
3,"Good, if you don't mind low volumes.","I bought these over a month ago, and had them for three days, before my cats got a hold of them. The sound quality was okay, if you could get the EQ just right. But I noticed that the higher the volume is, the more prominent a hissing sound on top of high end sounds. Not for blasting, but a good 'phone otherwise."
1,"Most comfortable, Awful cord noise.","I was so excited when I put these in my ears because they were so comfortable. Then I turned my ipod on and couldn't believe the cord noise. If I sat perfectly still, it was okay, then I noticed if I didn't have the ipod loud enough, I could hear my breathing! I guess I got what I paid for."
1,Meh...,"The headphones looked great and perfect coming out of the box, but then I put them in. Only one side had a strong bass, while the left side felt weak and outplayed. For a few days I thought I just had to ""break them in"" but that wasn't the case. I was not a fan of the headphones and I'm not happy with my purchase."
3,Again...good until they stopped working,I got 2 and 1/2 months out of these before one side stopped working. I couldn't detect any cord damage yet the right one would give out once in awhile and then finally never worked again. They're in the garbage now.
1,SKIP THESE - NO GOOD!,"I have an iPod Nano and the earbuds that came with it got stepped on. I thought I'd up the already decent (albeit slightly tinny) sound quality of those. I bought a pair of Sony High Performance earbuds ($35 at BJs) and they stunk.These CREATIVE LABS EP-630 earbuds were even worse! They have way to heavy bass (distorted and fuzzy) and the vocals and high tones get lost. It's mush! MUD! They also have the stethescope effect (make noise as they brush up aginst clothing, etc.) and they whistle in the wind a bit. The silicon is not so great...you have to put them too deeply into your ear canal, which only makes them sound more distorted.PASS ON THESE!"
2,Creative EP-630,"I have a uncanny hobby for testing earphones. Based on the 4 star rating that was given to the Creative EP-630 on Amazon I gave them a try. I was very dissapointed with them. Terrible lows, very little bass and high's were ok at best. For $35.00 there are much better choices out there including Senniheiser, Altec and Sony. I rated these earphones a two rather than a one because I have heard worse. I would say these earphones are a notch above the cheapo ones that cost $5 to $15. If you are looking for a good set of earphones at a reasonable price go with Sony, Altec or Sennihesier in the $30-$40 range, you will be happy you did."
2,Waaaaay too bassy,"For my tastes, these lean on the bass side of the spectrum way too much. From my iPhone, I get the best sound out of them by selecting the ""Treble Booster"" EQ setting (I tried ""Bass Reducer"", but that didn't sound as good). This is, of course, less than optimal.Unfortunetly, I just don't like these. They are very (not just a little, but ""very"") muddy and bassy to my ears. I am a 31 year old man that takes hyper-über-insane care of my hearing. I have little-to-no hearing loss and frequently hear sounds my peers and family do not, so please don't attribute this to hearing loss! ;)"
3,"Good, but nowhere near as great as Buddies Custom Earbuds","Sound quality is decent and they are fairly comfortable depending on what you're used to, but I don't think they're as comfortable or nearly as effective as the custom earbuds I recently purchased in new york. I now have a custom molded pair of earbuds from Buddies that fit my ears perfectly and block out all unwanted background noise. I'll never have to turn the volume on my ipod up more than half way again!!!"
4,i've bought these earbuds twice,i'm very happy with this product. they fit nicely in my ear and give me the sound i'm looking for.
2,flawed design,"the fit is funny no matter which size i use. i have previously used a sony one similar to this. since it doesn't fit properly, i can't judge its sound quality. the earbud is too short/stocky. its really useless for me because i must pressed into my ear in order to get the full sound."
3,Half good,"I can't recommend these whole-heartedly. Purchasing these headphones depends on how you use them. If you're primary use is while sitting motionless then you'll enjoy these headphones, but I would not recommend these while working out or even walking. The transmission of sound through the upper cable is extremely apparent. Additionally, the I'm not sure if these phones like cold weather either. The sound seems to cut out during these conditions.As far as the sound these headphones shift towards the bass. The sound is clear and detailed for the price,but not as detailed at the high end and sounds like music is coming out of a box. I would say good for rock or metal or any bass emphasized music. As I said would only recommend these headphones for certain conditions.If you're willing to spend 40-50, I would suggest spending a 80-100 for high quality headphones with 2 year warranties. Over the long run, you'll probably end up saving money for the improved quality and durability."
2,Good...until they stop working....,So...I love these...they block out annoying noises. BUT..they stop working randomly. I've owned 2 pairs and both had the same pattern. One side stopped working..then the other. You have to play with the cord to get the sound to continue and you just end up getting annoyed. Both started doing this after a few months. I'm going to something else....
3,Earbuds are great but... I wouldn't buy these again...,"Honestly, these earphones have great sound and everything said in the reviews about needing low volume and picking up the most subtle background tone in the music is absolutely true. I heard things in songs I didn't even know were there before! But...!!I have a major major problem with this set and I'd never recommend them to anyone. Mostly, the soft rubber/plastic/whatnot they used to coat the cords has almost a 'sticky' catching quality to them. It's soft and feels good to the touch, but they 'catch' on *everything*!! Coats, buttons, clothing, etc. - and all that does is serve to pull the buds out of your ears. Constantly. Very very annoying.Sorry - I love 'em, but they gotta go. Looking for a new pair... *sniff*"
1,"These were great when in ear buds first came out, now they lack","These were Creative's first and worst attempt at noise isolating in-ear buds (first in-ear from any company for under $50 back in 2006). The high frequencies get clipped (or 'hollow'), and the rubber material used in the cord creates a stethoscope effect that recently manufactured in-ear buds have improved on. That said, I have not yet upgraded and still find use for these when I am in especially noisy areas (rarely).If you sort the reviews on here by ""newest first"", you will see a trend of lower ratings in recent years, though over half of recent ratings still give 5 stars because of the noise cancellation. In a loud environment, in-ear noise blocking ear buds will sound better than standard ear buds or even much more expensive open-ear reference headphones.My 1 star rating reflects the EP-630's vs a more recently manufactured bud I tried (the 'Jbuds J2'), which I suspect is similar to other recently designed buds."
4,"Great, but EP-830 is even better","These are great headphones. All of the positive reviews are, by my lights, right. You don't break the bank, and you don't stoop to the level of the $5.95 cheapies in the electronics aisle. These headphones sound great.But you can do even better for only a little more money. Look at theCreative MZ0365 EP-830 Noise Isolating Earphones. These are the phones that ship standard with the ""X-FI"" version of the Zen. The improvement in sound is dramatic. Much wider range, a far deeper sound.Still, the 630's are by no means bad."
2,"Sub-par muddy fuzzy sound, AVOID!!!","Got a pair of these with my Dell XPS Laptop for free. I used to guess this is a rebrand of Senheiser CX-300(which I own), since they look almost exactly the same. However, after getting EP-630, I can tell you these are totally different products. EP-630 has a fuzzy muddy sound which blurs everything together. CX-300 is not a high-end earphone, but it delivers sound far better than EP-630.Did a quick comparison with some of the earphones I have. EP-630 is only better than the ones came with a Creative Zen micro MP3 player. But, I only paid $30 for the MP3 player, basically that earphone probably worth $2. EP-630 could not even beat the earbuds came with iPhone. IPhone earphones sound more balanced and clearer than EP-630. This would tell you a lot.EP-630 simply becomes unbearable after I listen to the same music with my Senheiser HD-280 and Etymotics ER-4s.AVIOD this one, there are many other earbuds in $30 range much more worthy than this."
2,"Decent Sound, but too air tight! Hurts my ears...","I bought these headphones, had them for only 1 day and returned them for refund.Sound is good, nothing special though...My main problem is once you put these in your ear they are air tight and when you pull them out of push them in it pushes and pulls on your ear drum, I find this very uncomfortable. I was using them at work and I am constantly putting them in and out when someone was talking to me or I needed to get up and do other things. I did try other sizes of ear pieces (the ones provided and even others) but when it's too loose it loses sound quality.I much prefer the Sony MDR-EX71 headphones, they are very similar except they have small holes in the back of the ear piece which allow for ventilation, while the silicone ear piece is sealed in your ear the air can escape through the tiny holes in the back of the ear piece.I would not recommend these headphones to anyone..."
3,"Okay, but not much else.","Maybe I'm expecting too much from ear-plug headphones, but there is simply nothing that stands out about the EP-630. They don't fit any better or worse than most(just a bit differently), and the sound isn't anything special either. It's clean and decent enough. I don't know if/how those 70-100 dollar earplugs are supposed to live up to their price and I doubt I'll bother finding out. So whenever my bigger headphones make me look like a dork(hats..etc) I'll have these as backup."
4,Good investment,"I had these headphones for about two years, after which point one side became very faint at times. They still work, but the left ear is usually about 3 times louder than the right. Nonetheless, I got two years of excellent use for the very reasonable price. I think they have the best sound quality of any in ear headphones that I have ever listened to.The sound quality issue may have been my fault for keeping them wrapped around my MP3 player all the time, but I still think they are a must buy for upgrading any mp3 player's sound."
1,"DON""T BUY THESE","Go to Big Lots and buy a $3.00 pair ofSentry headphones and you won't be anymoredisappointed-you'll just spend a lot lessmoney. One word to sum it ""awful""."
4,Not better than the cheap fontopias,"Have these, the ex-51 fontopias, and a slew of other ear-bud style headphones. These will suffice for the 99% of us who aren't real real into audio quality. Good sound quality, far superior to most, if not all, ear buds. Blows away the apple freebies of course.My only complaint about these (and all in-ear headphones, so far) is the complete lack of extra small ear thingies. the ""small"" that comes with these is too big for my tiny ear holes, so after more than like 1/2 an hour they get kinda uncomfortable. FYI, the ear thingies are the same sizes as the ones on the fontopias and the sennheisers and razers that are all around the same price as these. In fact they are all interchangeable."
2,"Great treble, no bass, ok noise isolation","First off, just to be clear, this is a noise ISOLATING earphone, not noise CANCELING. The soft silicone does a decent job of reducing external noise, especially higher frequency ones.I compared with a very old (1st generation) pair of Bose noise canceling headphones and found that the Bose canceled almost all external low frequency noise (e.g. running dishwasher) and some of the higher frequency noise. On the other hand, the Creative earphone cancels higher-frequency well but not low frequency. If you have music turned up to medium, it effectively blocks out sounds like keyboard typing.I'm unhappy with the frequency response of these. The bass is almost non-existent (worse than my 10-year old Sony $20 earphones) and the treble is decent but nothing to write home about. I'm a classical musician so trust me, I know how ""life like"" sound is supposed to sound.These are definitely not life-like.I think the best use may be for audio podcasts, that's about it!"
5,Musician review,"I read all the reviews before purchasing these which is more than the 5 listed here. I am in a 7 piece R&B/Funk/Variety band and use these with my IEM system. So far, I am really loving them. The clarity of sound throughout all ranges has been great. They do have the noise thing that is referred to in other posts but once you turn on the volume, that completely goes away. After purchasing my IEM system, I could not afford the high dollar ear buds and these are doing the trick nicely so far. I may upgrade in the future but for now, these are great."
4,they're good,I was mowing my lawn listening to my ipod with the ear buds it came with and I could barely here my jams (this is at maximum volume)...then I did it again with these ear buds and man did it dampen outside noise...I could really hear my music and I didn't even have to have the volume all the way up! One problem is they fall out of my ears and that gets annoying; and when I try to really stick them in it hurts my earholes...Overall I think they kick butt all hardcore and poop!
4,Creative EP-630 In-Ear Headphones,"Good earphones for the money. Bass is good, for a driver this small and they stay in the ear where you put them."
2,So that's why today's world is so screwed up!,"A Ph.D. thesis dressed up in New Age clothing. No narrative thread or spellbinding point of view to hold the book together, written by a former sculptor and art history teacher."
1,"Deadly dull, and deadly to the reader believing this","I was assured that this book wasn't just pure feminism, but to my disappointment, that's all it is. The conclusions are based on ""facts"" that lack clear documentation. Examples drawn from scripture are taken out of context. With prayerful consideration, I decided that this book could best help society at large by going to the landfill."
4,A Startling and Well-Researched Book.,"Merlin Stone's book presents the reader with information long suppressed and denied by Western culture: the hidden roots and history of our spiritual past, a time in which the Female had a much greater role than it does in current Western faiths. She provides a tremendous amount of support for her claims; one can only look to her voluminous bibliography to see that thorough research was a top priority. But be warned: it is easy to want to categorically deny her conclusions simply because they are suprising and unheard-of (though not unfounded). My only complaint is that the book is written in a very dry fashion; perhaps I wish, too, that Ms. Stone had allowed for greater cultural breadth (though it is impossible for her to delve any more *deeply*) in her studies. All the same, this was an extremely useful and enlightening book."
4,Jas a loy of history and information that i didnt kmow about,I found the book to be very good and open my eyes to a past that we dont know much about and how the world was before this one god showed up ..i would want everyone to read this
4,A wonderful piece of the bigger puzzle,"This book really helped to me to lay out the evidense for myself, and must have been an amazing wake up call when it was first published twenty years ago. Stone has done fantastic research to reveal the distorted common beliefs about the role of women in the begining of recorded history and although her feminist view point often threatens to pollute the fantastic content with bias, the information itself still stands well. So for those of you who love ancient cultures or those not afraid to have their patriarchal worlds redefined, this book is for you!"
5,important foundation for women's spirituality,"So many scholarly types chalk this book up to feminism which is unfair. This book set the tone for many to come, and the reason this particular book is important is that it is based in actual archaeology. Granted, some of the authors who come after Merlin Stone take this book way too far (e.g. Starhawk), but this should be required reading for prehistory students at the college level, along with all the Marxist interpretations of various prehistorical sites known to exist. Very readable and scrupulously researched."
1,Tunnel-Vision at its worst.....,"Before I was even done reading the first chapter I knew thatthis was going to be a ""man-bashing"" book. First, I wouldlike to state for the record that I am a Pagan and view thegods as both male and female and hold the Goddess asfirst among equals. That said, this book does nothingfor me. Merlin Stone kept getting on the case of ""other""writers being too biased....HELLO! This is one of the mostbiased books I ever read. If the distant past was really likethis for men, can you blame them for invastion? This booksays men were these weak, castrated, inferior shadowswho had no rights and were treated like second-classcitizens- they had no right to worship, they were godless,misfit step-children.....the really sad part is that somewomen think this is as it should be. Two wrongs do notmake a right! We must see the Divinity as both Male andFemale - through balance we will grow and learn fromeach other.PeaceObiwan"
4,A fresh perspective,"While I think it might be foolsih to swallow everything Stone writes, it is certainly an interesting hyopthesis. It's an absorbing read on a fascinating subject matter. She draws her own conclusions on accepted historic facts, and opened my eyes to the possiblie interpretations of history."
5,Extraordinary book one of my favourites of all times,"No words to describe how easy, marvelous and didactic.A work one can NOT miss; it gives us so much light on Judaism, Christianity and the previous and first world religion: the worship of the Goddess.This book with softness changed my life and open my eyes to religion.Thanks M. STone!"
5,A telling recounting of one person's Diaspora,"The telling of this most personal journey avoids any and all hyperbole or belittling. Boldly Andrew Lam presents the opportunities found by the exile who chooses to leave his homeland as well as the demanding adjustments he must undergo if he is to succeed in his adopted country.Back in Vietnam he is viewed as one who is exceptional, a person who has achieved the highest level of sucess. Those opportunites, he finds, do not exist in fact or spirit in his native land."
4,"Great small camera, good pictures","I've had this camera since just before Christmas 04. I purchased from www.bhphotovideo.com for about $350. I should have waited until after the holidays, because the price has come down. It is great to finally have a small camera. I often forget that I even have it with me (which I guess can be bad!). Over all the pictures are good. The focus is sometimes soft. It doesn't take good night photos, but takes great daytime pics."
4,The best small camera ever,"I have owned quite a few digital cameras, all of which seemed to have followed the rules of 'technical tradeoffs':If you want quality, you pay more and you lose form factor.If you want form factor, you pay more and you lose qualityIf you pay less, you lose on both quality and formfactor.And so on and so on.Knowing this, I bought this camera for its form factor and hence did not expect the highest quality pictures. Nonetheless, it has impressed me. I've barely touched the settings since I put the camera on auto focus and auto flash (well, except adjusting white balance).In fact, this is my second optio. I purchased the 4MP for myself about a year ago, and purchased the 5MP as a gift this year. The S5i has a much bigger and higher quality screen than the 4MP, which makes it easier to decide if you've nailed the shot or not.Overall, I would suggest this camera for a beginner/casual photographer on the go.."
3,"Good Info, Bad Practice",RHF's book provides good information. But the format of it is poor: repeated examples of improper usage stand out; corrections are quietly noted after each blunder. I would prefer a learning tool like this to emphasize the proper usage and only quietly note the common mistake.
5,Great DVD,"I am an avid romance reader, and when books like this started coming out in video, I bought the whole collection. Yes I do still have them for my VCR, but now a days everything is coming out on DVD, so I decided to purchase this. This type of romance DVD isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy good novels recreated as a movie, then you may enjoy this one."
2,"Nice Idea, Poor Construction","I'm giving it a 2 Star rating because the idea is worth something. But the plastic is a horrible choice of material. It can't handle any torque. Mine cracked and became worthless 3 seconds in. Long before I felt any strain on my own arms. That shouldn't happen.The device itself is basically a plastic cup designed to fit over the valve knobs so that you can get a grip on them and turn. This will not be good unless it is already easy to turn, just in a difficult place to reach. (Even that is a stretch, since it's a long strait tool.) You'll want to look somewhere else if your issue is difficulty turning the knob."
5,Hilarious,Takes me back to the days of my youth. Pure nostalgia. Jean Shepherd is the funniest writer of our times.
4,Not just about Wanda Hickey!,"I have some advice for all you readers. With the dawn of the Internet sometimes we cast our books aside and spend more time playing around on the computer than we need to. I found myself neglecting books I wanted to read. Mr. Shepherd is a bit older than I am, so I can't relate to the years or events that he spoke of totally. He talks about childhood and teenage memories, and I found that with a little updating we can all relate to at least some of what he went through growing up. First, try turning off some of the brainless night-time shows and leaving the computer off a few evenings, so you can rediscover all books. Second, pick up this gem by Jean Shepherd. A few pages into it, and I laughed until I was almost in tears. I did this alot throughout the book. This book of memories left behind by Mr. Shepherd is a real treat! Thank you."
5,Hilarious Childhood and Teenage Disasters,"This is one of the funniest books ever written. Jean Shepherd recounts his early years in a steelmill and oil refinery town in northern Indiana. The time is the late 1930's to 1940's. There is a sensible mother, a good-hearted father with an incredible vocabulary of cuss words, and a younger brother with an amazing ability to whine. We begin with the arrival next door of the Bumpus family, slovenly hillbillies with a million dogs that send our hero's father into explosions of outrage. We go through disaster after disaster until we reach the ultimate when our hero takes Wanda Hickey to the high school prom. I laughed so hard that I difficulty reading. Shepherd's mastery of description of small-town America in the 1940's is a pleasure to read, and it never stops being outrageously funny."
4,Hilariously funny! You'll laugh until you cry!,"If you like the all-time classic ""the Christmas Story"", you'll love this book. It's a perfect example of classic literature, because one time or another we have all gone through what Jean Shepherd's main character goes through. Wheather it's you first love, the county fair, and annoying little brother, the school bully, or you prom, it's all happened to us at one point in our life or another. This is a true classic that will never die. Shepard keeps you laughing nonstop with his details of the disturbing neighbor and keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat with his details of a Game called 'kill'. This is one book I high recommend if you want to feel like a kid again."
5,I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh!,"I really enjoyed this book because Jean really writes as if he is telling the story to a group of friends. I can almost hear him talking through his words. It was a little difficult to relate to because I grew up in California and none of my grandparents grew up in the US. He makes allusions to items from the Great Depression and the midwest, some of which I had never heard of. On the other hand, his stories are timeless and humorous. Everyone can relate to at least one incident in the book and laughter comes easy when Jean brings these stories to life."
4,Entertaining and creative,"Shepherd sure knows how to make a book interesting to read. This book expresses great humor as well as deeply enriched, creative topics; which always keep your mind refering back to the similarity it has with your own life!"
5,Read this book,"I read this book, handed to me as a must read! I thoroughly enjoyed ever page and the loud laughter it induced. The joy of the memories of my youth flooded back even being from a different era. Every one who was a child will enjoy the insights and memories rekindled by this book."
3,A book that takes you back to those exciting childhood times,"I thought that this book was all right, but I think it went into detail a little too much in some of the chapters. It was exciting reading about some of the childhood games that Shepherd wrote about. For example when Ralph and the bully played tops and how Ralph got excited when he got to go fishing with his father.But I also thought that it was kind of boring sometimes because some of the stories weren't that intersting to me at my age(17). I really like the way Shepherd writes though (how he exaggerates)."
4,An entertaining book but little more,"A funny series of stories told through the use of exageration and comedic situations. the humor keeps you turning the pages. it is a good Saturday afternoon book, but do not try to analyze the book. It is superficial, but that is what makes it entertaining. Although somewhat shallow, it will hold your attention and might make you laugh."
3,l highly recommend this book.,Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories is a light hearted satiracal view of a boys life in the 1930's. It's a good novel to read because it's life like and gives good detail.
3,Kindle edition is loaded with typos.,"It's sad that nobody bothered to read this before offering it for sale. For example, in the first story, there are three places in one paragraph where the word ""kind"" appears, making no sense. After a few seconds of study, I realized that the word was ""land"" and we're dealing with an OCR'ed and possibly unproofread book.(Update: OK, it was ""proofread"". Somebody did a ""search and replace"" so everywhere the work ""land"" should appear, we find the word ""kind"". Good work, whoever you are.)However, Jean Shepherd was great and so is this book. Five stars for the book, 1 star for the publisher, average three."
4,"Fun, funny, funnier...","This little gem of a book will have you chuckling outloud. Based on his life, author Jean Shepherd spins yarns of past loves, family vacations, top playing, and the awkwardness of growing up in a less-than-privileged part of town. You will connect with some stories, shake your head at others, and burst out laughing at most."
4,Recomend this book to all ages,"This book was one of the funniest books I have read, the best part was how I was able to relate to the stories in the book. This book must be read,the humor of Jean Shepherd is one of a kind."
3,Decent but overrated,"""I'm gonna Make Her Love Me"" is a must own & the best track. That makes it worth the price but the rest is a mixed bag."
2,If you like Muzak....,"then you'll love this one. But if you're looking for the original, well-known arrangements and performers you will be disappointed. This is the stuff of doctor's offices and elevators. Try one of the other Mancini offers; I'm going to."
1,Disney bean bag disappointing,"I purchased the same bean bag from a a discount company and when received, I sent it immediately back due to the quality and size of the bean bag. To my surprise, after ordering the Disney Princess bean bag from Amazom for an addditional $20 more than I paid with the disocount company, I received the same size/quality bean bag. The bag is small and most of the beans are flat. It came in a box that may have been a 15 inch cube. Although I was still very unhappy with the product, my 4-yr old, not knowing any better, grabbed it and happily ran off, very easily since it only weighs about 1-2 pounds. Not wanting a repeat of melodrama from returning the previous bag, I decided to keep it. She enjoys throwing it around, but it only a month, the bean bag is almost flat. Not a happy camper and definitely not pleased with the product."
1,Overpriced Miniture Bean Bag,"I purchased this Princess bean bag for my 2yr old daughter. I paid about $45+ after shipping. The bean bag is TINY!!!!!! The princess print on it is beautiful and colorful but it is WAY to small for a 2 year old. She barely fits in it. She will outgrow it in only a couple months! This is not something she'll be able to grow with or use for long. If your looking for something she can use for years, this size is not it!!! I returned this product. I recommend this product for toddlers less than 2yrs old."
1,Not great.,Save your money. This is a cute item but not worth 20 bones. My daughter has sat in in twice in 3 months. Save up for a $40-$80 chair/couch cus this thing is NOT worth it.
4,Sand Creek,The story developed quickly. Characters were believeable. Author kept the suspense to the end. Easy enjoyable read. A good mystery.
3,Only 2 good songs,The only 2 good songs on this soundtrack to an awesome movie from the 80's is Secret Loser and the hard to find Never Surrender. All others suck. Too bad they couldnt get the rest of the good songs from the movie from other bands like Motley Crue and a few others. With the exception of the two songs this is a horrible track listing.
4,This excellent offshore book has been updated.,An excellent book on the subject. Anthony has finally updated this book and called it International Tax Havens. Both it and Tax Havens cover the major tax havens but the best part is his discussion of offshore strategies and a number of different uses of offshore structures.
2,waste of time and money,Fell for the sale pitch on cool tools so bought set of five. Yes they do work but are much slower than a nail set and a hammer and you run out of fun factor real fast. the chisel is real waste of time and the punch is just to bad to talk about.Don't waste your money on this fools tool.
3,Don't be fooled by the name...,"Made in BEL in 2001, Serial# PA-774/2, Playing Time 37:05This will be my shortest review EVER!This CD is the ""Lost In Love"" album. PERIOD.It's on a gold CD, and the artwork only contains the front picture; the inside of the booklet contains pictures of other CDs from the record label... like a catalog.No liner notes, no lyrics, no credits.Nice music, but NOT a ""best of"", like the title implies... enough said!"
5,very user friendly,"For me personally, the best thing about this book is that I don't have to put my glasses on to read it. I love the color coding! I can quickly grab the book, open to the correct color combination and then just thumb through a few photos (not the whole darn book!) Most of the time the bird is still there to cross reference. Great little book."
4,A fine Stiffelio,"From the Parma 1968 performance starring Gastone Limarilli (Stiffelio), Angeles Gulin (Lina), Walter Alberti (Stankar), and conducted by Edgardo Egaddi. Italian only in libretto."
2,This is NOT the movie directed by Janne Wallin!!!,"OK, I have been searching for a copy of the Swedish film ""Lust"" directed by Janne Wallin and starring Cia Berg, lead singer of the group Whale. The Internet Movie Data Base pointed me to Amazon.com to purchase the video. Although it is listed as being directed by Janne Wallin, the film for sale here is a very low budget, straight to video movie about a guy who plays a computer game and then gets advice about girls from a 9 inch tall pianist that only he can see. Adding to this odd premise is the strange filming method of having all the actors shot against a green screen with all the backgrounds (poorly) chroma-keyed in. Alright, they had to do something like that for the little piano guy, but couldn't they have actually shot the actors in a real bar for the rest of the scenes? I would have given the film only one star but there are at least a couple of nice looking girls. Not really worth checking out though. ..."
4,History of a True Sage.,"Lots of detail and historical data related to Sai Baba of Shirdi ( Not to be confused with Sathia Sai Baba.) In 3 trips to India its, Shirdi Sai's Image you find in rural India. This book is rare because of the lack of documentation on Saints from this time period. From my understanding Shirdi Sai is the Real Deal. If you are drawn to either Sai Baba, you should definitely buy and read this book."
4,At last,"Finally, a Cafe Del Mar release that measures up to the first few CDs. Very relaxing, excellent chill. The tracks by Lovers Lane, CDM, and Mr. Swen G* are very good. Quantic's ""Time Is The Enemy"" is my favorite - a good, solid groove surrounded by pretty light and happy tracks. And I think I know what the last few volumes have been missing - a bossa nova track. Lazybatusu fits the bill here. Well done."
3,Wild Cat Women,i just recieved it and the 3D anaglyphics were good originaly a hard core sex feature about 4 sex scenes in spite of trimmed simulated second takes the story is strong and flat compatible if swv or alpha blue archives were to release the un cut version flat itbe good still the scene between bill margold and serena in soft version was an insert to originally spice up the pic so it realy never belonged obviously shot years later serenas first feature was teenage cruisers in 77 she was a red head at the time this was a time where porn poduction were big budgets on film i suppose the hard version is trimmed on the story side to focus on sex which would make it a better adult feature this could compete with other g rated blacksploitation film so as far as a 3d film its worth collecting good story good acting also i want to correct an error i made when i reviewed the bubble the couple was coming from a mountain trip not a party
5,"DJs of the world, watch out! Here is Tina Ann","This is definately not a song for the slow dancers. Very rapid-paced and VERY catchy. I enjoy it on my iPod while driving. I'll admit ""In My Dreams"" is a bad influence on my driving when I'm on the highways or in a rush to work. Tina Ann is definately up there with the ranks of dance/techno greats like La Bouche and Gabry Ponte. Don't be surprised if you see her name in the future on the charts.For fellow techno-dance fans out there, I highly recommend you listen to this song. It's a true dance club song which is why I give it 5 stars."
5,Great song!,"Tina Ann really shows us more of a range in this new song. You will remember her of the oft played ""Don't Want Another Man"" in which Dynamix featured her. This is a great dance song with beautiful vocals, and top notch porduction by Dezrok. If you can find in from it's domestic release go for it (it'll be a few bucks cheaper than the import)."
4,Another winner from Taylor,"Girl is another raunchy tale about a lusty college student that decides to make a profession of her favorite past time. There is even less of an external plot in Jill than there was in Girl. Basically, the book follows Jill from sexual encounter to sexual encounter.The distinct Taylor illustration style has not changed in his new book other than the addition of colour - which is integrated successfully. Some people will not like the thick lines and the physically impossible anatomies - if you are looking for realistic illustrations then von Gotha or Duvet are better bets. However, the crude, exaggerated illustrations match the super hard core story line.If you enjoy stories about beautiful girls that can't get enough satification and have inhuman sexual stamina, the Jill is your dream date. If you are looking for cutting edge art or sophisticated plot then you are better off with a different book."
2,Cheap and Dim,"I did a lot of research on Amazon by reading reviews before I bought this clock. I feel misled by all the five star reviews this clock got. It is cheaply made, the battery cover seems like it would break easily. I works ok but the light is way to dim to read the clock at night. A disappointment and not worth eight dollars."
5,Excellent Travel Clock,This is a simple-to-use travel clock. Far easier to set or reset time and wake-up than other clocks costing much more. My previous identical clock lasted over 12 years.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this alarm clock for travel. It is small and light, so good in that regard, but I found the time hard to read. The numerals are smaller than most clocks of this size, but most disappointing is the method for night viewing. There are two tiny bulbs on either side of the time display and they don't light up the time very well. Most digital time displays have a blue or neutral background when you hit the night light so the time is easy to read, even without glasses--but not this one. It was cheap and you get what you pay for..."
4,Just one small complaint...,"I agree with my fellow owners of this neat little travel alarm clock in that it is compact, sturdy, well-designed and durable. My only complaint is that the snooze time is only 4 minutes and it is not adjustable. That is a very short snooze and I would like 10 minutes much better. Better yet, make it adjustable and I would be a completely happy camper (traveler)."
2,Hate the snooze button,"My biggest problem with this clock is the snooze button. It's relatively small, so I had to really wake up to find it. Then, it only snoozed for four minutes! I want to snooze for nine. I didn't care for the back light - two small lights from the side rather than the soft blue glow behind the time that I'm used to. This clock will work in a pinch, but I'm definitely going to have to find a better clock."
2,Westclox Travelmate Alarm Review,"The clock works, but the light for night viewing is very dim. We would not recommend this clock to others."
5,Needed this,Wanted a very compact travel alarm to take on my upcoming trip to Australia and New Zealand. Very compact and easy to use.
4,Great travel alarm clock,"So far it has worked great, except the backlight that is supposed to let you see the time in the dark isn't strong enough to let you read the time in dark. A bedside flashlight does the trick, however."
2,Hard to used controls,"The controls to set alarms and time are very difficult to move. I nearly break a fingernail every time I set a different wake up time or turn off/on the alarm setting. And don't even think about selecting the alarm setting; I have to choose the alarm with snooze setting. With snooze, I can stop the alarm noise with the push of a big snooze bar; but with the alarm only setting, I have to be awake enough to locate the right control and try not to break my fingernail when attempting to turn it off. Worst trave alarm clock I every had."
2,Lighted display? Are you kidding?,"Should be a 5 Star, but the lighted display deserves a 1 Star. A worthy travel alarm clock is difficult to find. It seems there is always something no quite right with any model. The Westclox Travelmate has everything right: easy to set, large AM/PM indicator for alarm setting, increasing alarm volume and snooze, small and lightweight. BUT, the so-called light is so lame you cannot read the time even up close, and even in a very dark space,. Perhaps we received a lemon, but it is obvious the lighted display is not ""Indiglo"" which is also impossible to find now-a-days. If you don't need a lighted display this is one of the best travel alarms by far."
4,Westclox Travelmate Folding Alarm Clock,clock is well made and works fine. Digital numbers easy to read as well. Amazon was the only place I could find this item..great for traveling since it folds up for easy packing
4,I like it,"This is a very small functioning clock. I have had mine for years.Pros:It is silent.it does not have shining lightsBattery operated.compact and neatinexpensiveCons:The light is useless so you cant tell time in the darkthe switch on the left side is too similar to the alarm switch. When you wake up and are fumbling to turn off the alarm, you can accidentally hit the time set switch instead."
2,Don't Bother,"Received the Westclox Travelmate today, and just printed the return label.The face light does not illuminate; AM/PM does not appear on the face; the alarm is barely discernable, and yes...my hearing is excellent. Cheap, cheap, cheap. The designers need to go back to the drawing board."
2,Not for daily use,"This clock broke in less than 6 months, most likely because I used it everyday and did a lot of snoozing. It is small so does not take up much space on the night table or suitcase. If it was sturdier it would get more stars."
2,I'm returning this item,"I purchased this as a replacement for a travel alarm which I used on a daily basis for many years. I loved this design with all the controls conveniently located on the front of the clock. However, when I tested it in the dark I was so disappointed. It is described as 'backlight on demand'. However it is not backlit at all. There are two very weak, relatively useless, little bulbs on either side of the time display that do not shed enough light to allow you to read the time in a dark room. This just won't work for me. I'm returning it. Very disappointing."
3,It is as described,my 10 year old travel alarm finaly died :(This one seem to foot the bill and it very well may.The description did not share the battery type.How many of you carry around watch type batteries ?My old one used a single AA battery which iscommon to my camera and available anywhere.
2,Face is very dark & the light is no help,"There's no way I can read the time on this clock in the dark. When you press the snooze/light button on the front, there are 2 tiny lights that turn on at the side edges of the clockface. But, they're no help at all. You'll have to turn on the room light to read the time.This item showed up when I searched for an atomic alarm clock in my Amazon search. It's not atomic. You have to manually set the time & alarm.The button battery is so small it's difficult to handle. I dropped it 3 times trying to put it back in after removing the insulator tab.The packaging it came in was so stiff I had to cut the clock out, so I won't be able to return it."
4,travel alarm,"all is great (price, size, weight, battery) but the night light isn't bright enough to read the time without turning on a light."
3,Back light is useless,"I am replacing an indiglo travel alarm that I left in a hotel after carrying it for probably 15 years. I assumed the backlight feature on this new clock would render the time visible, but it is essentially a non-feature. There is a glow, but certainly not sufficient to read the time with. Aside from that large shortfall, the clock has the features I wanted; small, folds onto itself to avoid prolonged lights-on wearing down the battery, accurate, and a suffiently loud, (albeit not obnoxiously so) alarm. I just ordered an indiglo - this one goes bye-bye."
4,Wish it lit up,"This is everything I was looking for, but I wish the numbers lit up a bit brighter on the screen. They have a button to push for light, but it's so dim you can barley see the time in the dark."
5,Westclox Travelmate Folding Alarm Clock,Best travel alarm clock I have purchased. Finally found one that is perfect. Alarm is loud enough to hear plus it is a convenient size.
2,Good product but better ones available,"This unit is a little big for a small traveling suitcase where space is extremely limited. I like the little Westclox better for about the same amount of money (I bought both, but I am not using this one at all). Hey, it works, and it lasts (both units). In a day where quality is in short supply, I guess this is a good investment since it is also relatively cheap as well as pragmatic. Enjoy!"
5,"Very nice, good value","Nice little clock for the money, easy to use, big snooze button, handy fold-up design. Have two of them that have lasted for over 2 years with no problems."
5,I love this clock,"This is a wonderful alarm clock for travel -- lightweight and easy to use. The alarm is about medium in volume. It starts with a gentle rhythm, 1-2 pause, then gets a bit more insistent (more rings between short pauses) until you turn it off. The light is not very bright, but I found it adequate in a dark room. The clock folds very compactly -- the stand showing behind the clock in the picture rotates around and becomes a cover. Folded up, the clock is about 5/8"" thick. It arrived with the battery installed. All I had to do was pull the plastic tab to enable the battery to start, and the clock was ready to go."
4,Pretty good travel clock,"The price is right on this clock. The size is perfect, especially when folded for packing and taking with. It sits at a good angle when it's open, and the backlight is sufficient. The alarm tone being sufficient to wake you up is, of course, by personal opinion. It works for me, but it might not work for you if you're a heavy sleeper. I would also knock the battery choice...coin type versus a AA or AAA. I worry how quickly that coin battery will die since I'm a habitual ""3 time snoozer."" I ordered a card of 10 batteries, so I'd have plenty on hand just in case."
1,disappointed,"Very disappointing - the light does not light up the numbers well enough to read them in the dark. This will get returned. I guess I need to keep shopping for something you can see at night time, this certainly isn't it."
4,"Great, but inadequate night light","The night light wasn't good enough in the dark, sent it back. My previous one of this model with the same dim light works for years.If it had a night light that i could read in the dark it would be great.If you have to put on reading glasses to read it, and maybe a lamp, it isn't good enough. If you never check the time in the middle of the night so don't need to turn on a lamp, then this is a great travel clock."
2,"Not very loud; shuts off after a minute, useless light...","..probably not a good choice for a sound sleeper.The alarm on this clock is not very loud. I measured it at 75 dB at a distance of 1 foot from the alarm (usingthe sound metercomponent of Smart Tools Pro on an Android phone).This would be forgivable if the alarm were persistent, but it shuts off after one 1 minute of operation.The light is ineffective; you won't be able to read the time on this clock in a dark room without an external light source.In addition, this alarm uses a 1.5v button style battery, a form factor that might be hard to locate in a pinch should it run out on the road.Avoid if the user is a heavy sleeper!Better than no alarm clock at all...but barely."
3,good and bad,"5 stars for simplicity1 star for the ridiculously useless light which is not strong enough to read the dial.A better buy is the Westclox Celebrity Glo-Clock which is as simple, easy to use, and with the press of a button gives a clear readout."
4,Good little clock,This is a nice little travel clock for the price. Once I get my night light working again I'll be able to see it in the half bath I bought it for.
1,fragile and doesn't light up,"not worth the price, my $ store clock is better. the plastic is very think and fragile and there are 2 dim leds on the sides that barely light up."
1,Worthless at night!,"This is a good compact size and easy to use, but you can only see the time if you have the lights on. The clock has two small lights on either side of the digits, but they do not provide enough light to see the time in a dark room."
5,Great little travel alarm,"These are great little clocks. I have used them for over 15 years, and keep buying them 3 or 4 at a time. Why? Because sooner or later I will leave my clock in a hotel room somewhere. (And once a colleague found it and ""sort of failed to return it"" because she liked it so much.) Important to me is that it has separate hour and minute settings - I cross a LOT of time zones, and resetting this clock is as easy as can be. I have tried the clocks that sense the time zone automatically, which works fine in the US but not at all in most of the rest of the world. This clock is reliable, easy, small, light, durable and cheap. The all-time bargain of the clock world. Just great."
1,Viewing Light is Useless,"A travel night alarm clock that you cannot see the time at night. Who thinks of these things?The viewing light is so dim that you cannot see the time at night. If that isn't a problem, then the clock is OK. Logically, this is a NIGHT clock, so viewing the time at night should be a major functional feature."
3,Westclox Travelmate,"The price was good. However, the back light is very dim. The time is difficult to read in the dark. I purchased for use as a bedside clock."
3,Mixed blessing,"I owned my previous Westclox Travelmate for more than 12 years. It was the only alarm clock I owned - or needed. Very reliable & accurate - for most of those years. It began to go screwy only the last couple of years I had it.So I replaced it with another Travelmate, just a couple of months ago. At first I was very pleased with my purchase, but this one is already exhibiting the bugs of the first Travelmate - almost right out of the gate. The time setting and alarm setting often change - spontaneously and mysteriously - all by themselves, sometimes several times during the same day! Since the problem has not gone away, and since I cannot depend upon it to process time accurately (a core requirement for an alarm clock, wouldn't you say?), I have decided to replace it with something better. Since it cost only a few bucks, it simply is not a good use of my time to go through the hassle and expense of returning it for a refund.Westclox, are you listening?Westclox Travelmate"
4,Nice little clock,"I bought 2 of these little clocks-one for me and one for my husband as we have small night tables and wanted simple and reliable alarms. The controls are in the front and very ease to use as is the alarm on/off. The alarm is loud enough, but not too loud. The clock is very compact and has worked very well. The only thing I don't like is the light--when you push the button to turn on the light to see the time at night it doesn't really work--my husband's clock has more light than mine. Otherwise, and even with this defect, this clock is what I was looking for."
3,travel alarm clock,"I found the alarm on this clock works very well and is easy to set up. However, with the first clock I received, you couldn't see the time at night because the background doesn't light up enough. I called the company and they replaced the clock, which I appreciated, however, the second clock didn't work any better! You have to turn on a light to see what time it is at night time which defeats the purpose of getting a clock that is supposed to light up!"
5,Handy and Durable,"I got tired of the new fangled gadjets not working or having to be an engineer to make them work.This alarm is simple, loud and will last many years. I had to hunt for it but was glad to see it was still in production to replace my old one which after many years gave up the ghost."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For,"Light weight, easy to set and read and well made. Glad that I purchased it."
1,Not as described,"The problem was the ""backlight."" was so weak that it was not possible to see the numbers, even in a very dark space. Otherwise, it was a nice little clock. Good design, buttons were easy to use, loud alarm, but all that couldn't be that useful because the numbers were so hard to see. I returned it."
1,Light on clock is useless,"I hope you can see in the dark because the light on this clock is useless. You will need a flashlight to see the time. Other than that its OK. Battery replacement will be an issue. Yes it takes a weird battery not an easy to find AAA. So after the battery is dead this thing is going in the trash. However, it is better than my old one that doesn't work."
2,Not a reliable one,"I used it in the past half a year and find the time displayed sometimes jump randomly. It happened 3 or 4 times in past 5 months. If you seriously need an alarm clock to keep you from being late for school or business, try to find another one."
1,CHEAP!,DIDNT LAST 1 WEEK!! NUMBERS IN SCREEN WHEN ALL WIERD...DOESNT READ NO MORE...ALARM DIED IN 3 DAYS...COMPLETE DEATH 5 DAYS...AWESOME WHILED IT WORK....2 DAYS......OH I LOVED IT WHEN IT WOKE ME UP 1 HR EARLY...THEN THE NEXT DAY 2 HRS LATE!!! I WAS LATE FOR WORK!
3,Ruined by Nickels' Editorial Comments,"Most of the writings of Mr. Armstrong in this book are helpful and are doctrinally sound. It is good to see his articles compiled all in one book. However, I found Nickels' editorial to be biased. I find much of his criticism of Mr. Armstrong to be given without ample proof. I would say that if this book is purchased it is best to concentrate on Mr. Armstrong's writings and take Mr. Nickel's comments with a grain of salt."
1,One man's view of another man's writings,"The title states that this book is edited by Mr. Nickels, but ""editorial"" might be a better way to put it. Generally, editing refers to which works are included. In Mr. Nickels collection, some articles are reprinted as is, others are significantly condensed, and still others are summaries of a ""historic"" article - but no article is reprinted for us to review. Finally, Mr. Nickels devotes a number of pages to his particular views about Herbert Armstrong. We should be allowed to judge for ourselves, and this collection is of very limited value in that regard."
3,Jwin Electronics JS-P601 Home Theater Speaker System,"Pros. The system does exactly what it advertises---provides satisfactory surround sound for a low price. It works best in a small room. The speakers are small which lend to unobtrusive positioning and speaker wires plug in which makes positioning more versitle,Cons. There is no volume control which is a major limitation as it requires manually adjusting three knobs. It also lacks digital audio input."
2,so so,product does not have a remote!!!!!! u have to adjust the sound all the time. only thing good about it is the sound is pretty good.
2,buy it only if you have extra cash to burn,"It is not a very good product. Only bought it because it was cheap, but it is very much useless."
4,Dr. Math Presents More Geometry: Learning Geometry is Easy! Just Ask Dr. Math.,Will be using to assist students in HS Geometry as well as passing their state graduation exam.
1,Inaccurate,"Has a good number of glaring inaccuracies re ME/CFIDS, including that most people recover and recommending graded exercise."
4,Wonderful At-Home Tool,"This is a great book, my mother had one years ago and recently updated to the newer version. My husband and I are now expecting our first child, so naturally I wanted to get a copy for our home. It is a great reference tool to have at home. Just remember to be cautious sometimes because it is not always going to be correct, but still makes a great starting point."
1,Poor scientific assessment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,"I am familiar with the research on CFS, the authors of this book clearly are not. That leads me to question the validity of the other entries."
3,Disappointed,I was updating the medical guide I had for 20 years and the first thing I looked up was rotator cuff surgery and couldn't find it and have no idea what I was doing wrong.
2,Cheesy for today's kiddos,"""Old school"" animation as my third graders termed it. They did watch it but with limited interest."
2,low,The book had really yellow pages with lots of highlighting and writing that was very hard to read. Looked like a really older book but the pages were not torn.
1,not for me.,"I read the reviews before I purchased (and a lot on-line) and knew that this wouldn't work for some people. I was one of those people. I tried it for six months and the only thing that seemed to change was my appetite and weight gain. Still got migraines all the time. Now I'm off the Feverfew and working with something else, my appetite is back to normal and I'm losing the weight."
5,Useful for my prayer life,I'm kind of astounded at the people who don't find Robert Benson's book helpful or find problems with it. I use it every morning and have for years. It's one of the best I've found to use year after year. All Benson's writings are meaningful and I recently used his book on baseball in a sermon.Venite is truly my call to prayer each morning and I find God in this book.
3,alarm alert,"This has an alarm on it which kept going off at all hours which we could not figure out how to turn off, We finally had to disconnect the wire to the alarm . It doesn't need an alarm to work properly."
2,Not good!!,Not exactly what I had expected. The outside temperature unit does not work. I have tried numerous times of trying to reset this unit to avail.
1,Don't waste you money......,"I purchased this wireless thermometer in february and it quit working the last week of May. It seems the sending unit quit sending, or the receiving unit stopped receiving. Either way, it's worthless. If this is the quality of their product, Oregon Scientific is in big trouble. Do not buy one of these!!!"
1,Alarm Problem,"I consider myself of average technical ability, and inspite of reading all reviews I could never get the alarm from going off at odd hours...tested every conceivable solution. I tossed it in the trash. I have other Oregon Scientific products continue to work fine ... automatic time change, no alarm issues, all I do is replace batteries. This particular product has design flaw."
1,TERRIBLE,THIS IS TRASH. THIS CLOCK EVENTUALLY DETERIORATES AND ERRORS OUT. IT EVENTUALLY IS UNSETTABLE AND UNRELIABLE. IT IS A WASTE.
1,remote sensor inaccurate & frequent resets required,"Nice concept, very poor execution.Good: Large easy to read digitsBad: remote sensor off by 8-12 degrees, for some reason after the clock is set my device loses contact with the remote sensor, requiring reset, so you can either use the clock function or the inaccurate remote temperature sensor."
1,dissatisfied,"The indoor/outdoor thermometer arrived. It set it up, installing the batteries. The outside tranmitter was not picked up by the receiver. It was returned for credit."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK,"We bought this for a cabin in the snow. After reading the directions multiple times, we could not turn off the ""freeze alert"" alarm that would then beep at all hours of the night. The alarm clock is hard to use and it would go off at weird times, too.We have replaced this item with a wind & weather item that has NO ALARMS!"
2,Annoying piece of crap!,"If you are looking for a cheap thermometer with wireless outside temperature this would be a fine option.BUTit's a real mess to adjust and DEACTIVATE the hi/lo temperature alarms.... specially an automated alarm that sounds when there's freezing temperatures outside, and its REALLY ANNOYING! because if you have this little piece of crap in your bedroom or in the kitchen you will be woke up with a beep beep beep that you will not be able to figure how to deactivate. And after 20 or 30 minutes hear the beep again and again until madness takes on you.Since low temperatures appear on the night this stupid termomether will keep you leaving your bed until you smash it on the wall or remove the batteries from it.Be warned!"
2,Excellent,This book gives an excellent account of Jewish life during the holocaust. Nothing is omitted and the reader feels all of the emotions Sonia and her sister lived through.
3,I promised i would tell,"I didn't think the book was particularly well written. However, I read it for the historical material and appreciated that aspect of it."
5,I Promise I Would Tell,"An amazing first hand account of the nightmare Sonia and her family experienced during the war/holocaust. This book allows us to remember something that should never be forgotten. This is an amazing story written by a remarkably strong, courageous woman."
4,"If we do not learn from history, we are destined to repeat it...",I have recommended to friends. The writing is filled with very personal memories that faithfully recall a terrible time in history.It begs us to remember.
3,A fairly good story,"She has deep poetry, and wonderful she could write her story. It tells a story, but leaves a lot of gaps. Could have been better."
1,A Hobbyist point of view.,"From a Fireworks-Hobbyist point of view, I am very disappointed, having high expectations from this 2001 publication, expecting maybe something more up to date. There are several references of ""Weingart (1947) and Shimizu (1980-96)"" formulations with at best vague descriptions of ""how-to"", referring the reader to their books for a more complete and detailed version. Rather get Shimizu's book and have the complete version to begin with not some small incomplete abstract of it, and the same goes for almost all the other references. On the up-side, I see this book as the great book of little abstracts loaded with historical interests, teaching you the Japanese words for different firework devices...that is if that's your interest."
1,"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices","Please be aware that the same product is available in few different names with different prices like ""Changes in Properties of Matter (2000)"".So before you order ensure which one would be the wise option"
4,A Good Book,"Have you ever wondered how to deal when going to a better school? ""Taking Sides"" by Gary Soto explains how two friends deal with that problem. Another book I have read by Mr. Soto is ""Local News"" which is a good book. Other books by Gary Soto are: ""Baseball in April"" and ""Pacific Crossing"". I give ""Taking Sides"" 4.3 stars. I gave this book that rating because it is very well written. I would recommend this book to lovers of basketball. I would also recommend this book to people who like romance. This book has two stories going on. One is sort of a romance. The other story is about how two do and don't get a long. Now you know about a good book, so go out and buy it."
3,read this book,"""I'd rather be playing for Franklin then Columbus"" Lincoln says. Lincoln is the main character in the book ""Taking Sides"" by Gary Soto. If you want to know what this quote means keep on reading.Lincoln is an athletic boy who just moved to a small rich town from living in a poor town where things are always stolen. He had to leave all his friends behind and his girl-friend. His passion is playing basketball. Now he has to play an important game against his old team. The worst part is that he is losing his best friend for playing on the other team. Will he play hard with his new team or will he throw away the important game to keep his best friend?This is for both boys and girls that are interested in athletics. Also for people who like competition. Would you try to win the game or would you throw the game away? If you want to find out what happens in the end read this interesting book."
4,I liked it!,"I am a 6th grader from Burlington, Washington and I am going to review Taking Sides by Gary Soto.These are my opinions why I reccomend this book for 10-16 year olds.It's about an 8th grader named Lincoln Mendoza from California. Lincoln moves schools from a poor school to a rich kid school which he calls the kids GAVACHOS which is a spanish word for white kids. Lincold needs to decide if he wants to lead his new basketball team to victory against his old basketball team which was the poor kids. Or will he go easy on his old abandoned team??"
3,Book Review,This book is a great book for teaching discrimination and assumptions made by others of different races. Rather dry at times but to the point.
2,taking sides,This book is pretty good but it has some problems like they sspeak spanish and some kids don't understand but like Iunderstand it because I speak spanish so it was pretty funbook.we read the book in groups and mostly my peple thatwith me spoke English so they didn't get it.I gave it twostars wich is pretty bad I think I think most people wouldgive it 2 stars at max so this book is pretty dum I think.I don't recomend it to you because you might not get it.Thats my review thank you.
2,An okay book,"Last year in 6th grade, we had to read this book aloud in class. At first I was interested because like the character in the book, I had just recently gone to a new school. But as we got further into it, it got boring. It was hard to follow, and they kept repeating the same topics. And the sides he had to take were a lot less imperative than I expected. It was just kind of like which school I like better. I think you need to be older to read it, because it will put 6th graders who like action or strong storylines to sleep."
4,taking sides,I enjoyed this book a lot. It was interesting. It showed how a kid dealt with a problem and what he went through. I would recomend this book to young adults that went through a hard time. The short stories that are also in the book were interesting. They also had a lot of descriptions.
3,Not much here,"This item was okay, but it contained very little info on Vivaldi and much less than I expected and needed."
4,Get a different version...from Australia,In OZ we have a similar product but also has the video included in both Quick Time and MPG formats. But our Oz version retails for about $1.99 which is about $1.10 American.If possible get the OZ version.Clip for El Manana song is really great...can't wait for the whole animated album
5,She is a gift of grace,"Everytime I think the world gets too much for me to take this writer comes out with something better and better. She always pulls me up by the bootstraps. Even better, she reminds me not to hate or be angry but that love will heal. I always look to her tapes and books when I need uplifted. This one, ILLUMINATA and A WOMAN""S WORTH are simply the best. Two thumbs up for writing positively about the Harry Potter books and seeing them for what they are. She is grace herself."
1,This tape will put you to sleep,"If you love Marianne's tapes, do not buy this one. She reads in a breathey, monotone, drone. Especially if you listen while driving, the tapes are deadly!"
1,It's time for Marianne to stop,"Two pages in I realized that Ms. Williamson must have a book deal to fulfill. Her latest is trite, repetitive, and self-indulgent. It reeks of claustrophobic melancholy -- of being trapped in a small room with someone who has long since run out of anything meaningful to communicate.It's message is basic Zen: be still. That's it. Over and over again...I'm sure her ""followers"" will snap this up and strain to find the gospel within it; others would be well advised to borrow it from the library."
4,Delightful book,"This book teaches how to change the world by dealing with the little things in life from a spiritually enlightened perspective. You may not be able to change the world today, but you can change your personal world and the personal world of those around you right now. Instead of snarling at the nasty checkout person you can instead give them a smile. Instead of thinking of them as this or that, why not see them as beautiful souls who need love and prayer? The result will be inner peace, and in the long run, world peace. This book and Taro Gold's new book of wisdom ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" went out to all the folks on my Holiday list! Excellent."
4,I was surprised,"I bought this book some time ago and never read it. All the hoopla turned me off (you know, Oprah and the like- I DO love Oprah, but she often picks such trying stories). Today I sat down with EveryDay Grace and pretty soon I was looking for a pencil to mark passages I want to find again. WOW. I wasn't expecting this little book to have messages I've been needing to hear. Of course, timing is everything, but I wouldn't pass on this book if you are looking for a way to connect your spiritual life with your everyday life."
5,A real gem,"Marrianne Williamson's work is both real and honest. Rather than couch things in a concepts that are alien or extremely religious, she talks to you about the realities of existing. Of how things will not always be easy, about how you will lose your way, and honestly how to see people clearly. Growth is messy, it's not neat, maturity is not easy, nor is spirtiuality delicate work, but with assistance from a tape like this you can see yourself clearly and how to bridge yourself from concept to human to spiritual being."
5,Wonderful,"I was a small bit apprehensive when I began this read as I was not sure what I would find written on the pages of this work. However from the first chapter I was drawn into what this author had to say.Everyday Grace is a Spiritual writing, giving insight that the author has learned into the world of the supernatural. Now don't get turned off here, it is not spooky or in anyway connected with the darkside,but rather a gentle guide back to our roots with our Heavenly Father.I loved the way Ms. Williamson explains how we have forgotten where we came from, and the resources we have within to help us on our lives journey. Excellent. I believe we all need a reminder of that.All in all I have to highly recommend this book. It was enlightening and like a breath of fresh air that held a tender reminder that with a few changes our life could spawn miracles for ourselves and others.Shirley JohnsonSenior ReviewerMidWest Book Review"
2,BLAH COFFEE,THIS IS THE FIRST COFFEE I DRANK OUT OF MY MACHINR. I WAS NOT IMPRESSED. LIKE THE COMPANY BUT THIS IS A BLAH FLAVOR WITH NO WOW TO IT. THE NANTUKET BLEND IS A GOOD CUP OF JOE IF U WANT TO TRY GREEN MOUNTAIN. PERSONALLY I LIKE TIMOTHY'S.
4,Good cup of medium blend coffee,The Green Mountain Breakfast blend is one of our favorites. It is a quality medium blend that is smooth and not bitter.
2,"Weak, bland, blech... and I just started drinking coffee","Just started drinking coffee after 36 years and I feel so strongly about how uninteresting and weak this stuff is that I feel compelled to give my 2 cents.It seems even though I'm a newbie I like it strong and black. I like the Donut Shop. At work I like coffee that coats the teeth a bit. I know, gross.There's just nothing going on here. Little taste. Little aroma. If you make a small cup it's a bit better. In short, if you genuinely like black coffee that tastes like coffee don't get this.If you like it weak, or as others have said you just need a base for a fluffy drink (which is cool) then I guess this would work."
1,Total waste of time and money,"I bought the IPAQ because it offered synchronized functions with MS Outlook on my PC. The synch worked OK, but I soon regretted the purchase. Working with the tiny stylus on a tiny soft keyboard image was tedious in the extreme, and THEN the battery stopped keeping its charge. Bought a new battery. Soon the next one stopped keeping its charge.Now the IPAQ will not turn on AT ALL, even sitting in its recharge dock. And of course the total failure happened after the limited warranty had expired. And this for something that cost me a lot more than a smart phone.I'm going low tech for a while to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
1,Only 1 year it worked NOT BAD!,"I dislike it very much! First, during 2-nd month working problems with battery occured. Then the touch-screen did not work well. And after one year the touch screen does not work at all!!!"
3,"It's okay, not as strong as the debut","I like this album, but it is not as strong as her debut. I'd do away with the interludes and concentrate on full length songs. That one intro was too long at the beginning. I like the album's emphasis on live instruments and a band backing her rather that the floods of '80s samples and interpolations of '80s songs that dominated her debut. Her singing is stronger here, but she doesn't seem to connect with some of the songs. Last few songs on the album sounded like rejects from Ja Rule's album or the other The Inc. records artists. A few of the ballads sounded bland. Somehow, I think that Beyonce's album outdid Ashanti in the musicality department, since they came out one week of each other. Ashanti has the talent, but she needs to come out with more stronger product or go to some other producers to update her sound a little bit."
2,What the hell is this,"Ashanti's second cd entitled ""Chapter 2"" is a waste of money and time. Personally, I am not an Ashanti fan anyway, but this sort of puts the icing on the cake. The first cd was much better and it's not just because of the fact that she was a new artist and no one really knew her style, but almost every song on this cd sounds the same. Out of the 16 songs on this cd, I only play 3 songs: Rock wit u, Rain on me, and I don't mind. Other than that, everything sounds sampled and her voice sounds more like she is whining than singing. I really do not understand because Ashanti can usually hold a tune, but this cd completely did not hold anything with me."
4,More than 1 good song (rare on many cd's),"I was surprised by how good this cd is. I'm not a big Ashanti fan, but this CD may have changed my mind. ""Rain on Me"" is an awesome song."
1,Worthless,"I am sorry but this album is not worth two cents. I did like her first song foolish and everyone knows she took the beat from Biggie's One more chance but I did not know the beat to all of her songs are somebody elses. Her rock with you video is horible. When did she become Janet Jackson. She does not deserve the title of princess of hip hop when you have a lot more talented young female artist like tweet,lil'mo,beyonce,brandy, and a lot more. If you want good music don't buy this cd because you are going to try to find the nearst pond shop and get your money back."
3,ol' school...,"im feelin da ol' school sound of some of her songs, i still think her 1st cd was better but dis 1 is good 2, especially da sexy songs at the end, lol...."
3,Still there is something,"Plain and simply put, Ashanti needs to really work on strengthening her voice! Her cutsy songs and lullabies from her first album worked well with a soft voice. But now, on her sophomore release, we (the fans and general audience) should be able to expect an indication of growth, both vocally and lyrically. But I do wish her the best. Maybe her third release will be a shocker...."
2,It's Decent at best....,"This CD is decent. And I think the current overall score of 3 is worthy. Not being an Ashanti fan at all, I did give this CD a listen and I found stuff that I liked and also stuff that I definitely didn't like. Items such as, ""Sweet Baby"", ""Rock wit u"" and the best song on the disc...""Rain on me"" all were good. Mostly all of the other songs were listenable, but I wouldn't want to do it twice. There are some really generic songs on here. In my opinion, where this Ahsanti disc goes wrong is allowing all of these thug sounding guys on her songs. I for one, have had it with singers and rappers working together. It worked with Mary J and Redman, but it need not be on every disc I hear! This CD also had way too many skits that weren't really necessary in my opinion. All in all, it's a semi-decent listen, but don't expect it to be a must have. Ashanti needs an energy boost as does much of R&B with the exception of the neo-soul artists. It's time to start doing things differently."
1,Not soo good!,"Ashanti's new album ""Chapter 2"" isn't all that. I did not expect it to be like this. I prefer Beyonce's album ""Crazy in love"" much more than this. Im waiting for the release of Mya's new album ""Moodring"" on July 22, the songs in Mya's album are amazing, Im feelin' de CD."
1,GARBAGE!!!!!!!,HORRIBLE FROM START TILL FINSIHTHEIR ARE ONLY 3 SONGS I LIKEOTHER THAN THAT THIS ALBUM SHOULD'VEBEEN SHELVED.
2,honestly....garbage,"This album....damn this album!I really liked her debut album.This album was stupid(and not in a good way), I want a refund..it feels like a lost britney spears album and when she aims for substance she gives up half way. Save your money.DAMN DAMN DAMN!whats sad is I bought Concrete Rose..same result, fool me twice shame on me Ashanti I dont blame you...I was at fault for not learning from Chapter 2."
2,Okay????,"I thought that ashanti was able to sing, but after buying this cd, i found that she doesnt really have such immense talent. Her voice gets annoying after a while and the cd is reminiscent of an 80's discoteque. The style of music is mostly disco? I always thought that ashanti was a hip hop star. There are maybe afew good songs on the cd, such as ""rock wit me"" and the story of love. The rest are seem old and have been done before. Ashanti should try and go into new lengths in her music. She should choose better songs to sing and stop collaborating with those rap people. They dont make her anybit gangsterish, but even more annoying and less nice. She should try and find a new label such as sony maybe. Murder inc doesnt try to exuberate her talent. I am sure that she has got a good voice (maybe shown in shany shia), but the songs she sings doesnt make us want to know! Sorry ashanti! Try harder next time."
3,JUST ALRIGHT,"This album is nothing really to brag about but it's just okay. Ashanti was never really a big fan of mine but sometimes she releases good singles. My favorite tracks from this album are ""Break up 2 Make up"", ""I found Lovin"", and ""Rain on me"". The first single off this album wasn't to bad either but it surely got a lot of airplay. Even though the two singles released from this album made it into the Billboard top ten chart, the album didn't sell as much as the first one. Chapter two has been certified platinum which is still good but I think her debut CD sold over three million copies. I try not to compare music artist because everyone is an individual and does their own thing. Most music artist have their time to shine and Ashanti has had her moments but she needs to come back very strong or else she will be forgotten. Overall, the album is okay. It's not a must have but good to get."
1,Support real artistry,"I'm not hear to crack on Ashanti, but, I have been disappointed with the world and their acceptance of musically-challenged artists. Every year, we find new artist and put them on this pedastal of greatness, and they (the artist) prove time and time again that they actually can't sing live. Last years and this years happened to be Ashanti. Ashanti can't sing, and for all the people out there who think she can........clean out your ear wax! It's really thick! But, I give Ashanti credit for being able to write catchy tunes, but this album is a step back form her first album. The songs lack substance and I would suggest you pick up Tweet's Southern Hummingbird or Beyonce's Dangerously In Love."
3,A LittleToo Soon,"Well this is an old joint now but there were far too many shout out's, and fillers. She needs to worry less about what the paparizi is saying and more on more creativity. Her new joint is out on the Dec. 16, 04 and I can't wait but I hope it will have a different flava from her previous joints. Because I hate to say that if it is not she will have to go into early retirement or lay real low for a minute and comeback with a bonafide banger. I like can appreciate her beauty, style but she needs to renvigorate her aura."
1,this cd doesn't deserve 2 be # 1 in the 40charts,"ashanti is pretty. but i think she could've done better. Beyonce ""Dangerously in Love"" should've been #1 on the 40chars. I mean Beyonce has really got it 2gether on winning 5 grammy awards""04 and ashanti didn't get none she hasn't made any improvement at all. SHE DOESN'T EVEN GOT THE VOICE LIKE BEYONCE. ASHANTI YOUR ALBUM ISN'T ALL THAT GOOD."
5,*~Great Album from the Princess ~*!,"Chapter II is a very nice album. Ashanti sings very lovely and the songs are very different from the first album. She sings about not just love but life. I think she has a soft beautifal voice,like on ""Rain On Me"",""Story of 2"",""I Dont Mind"",""Sweet Baby"" and alot more!"
3,What Happened!?!?!?!,"What happened to the Ashanti i loved!! her debut album set the bar to high with songs like foolish, rescue and baby..This album is basically a bunch of album fillers..her b-sides are way better and deserve to be on this album..however some songs are good:Rock Wit U - One of those songs u feel like cruising to...has the whole beachy sound to it 4/5Breakup 2 Makeup - Once again u feel like ur cruising, this song relates to anyone who finds themselves still after their ex 5/5Rain On Me - Her second single, with a killer video 3/5I Dont Mind - Reminds me of Rescue from her first album...along the lines of Janets 'Would You Mind' 4/5Ur better off buying Janets - Damita Jo one of the best albums of 2004!!!"
2,aShaNTi aShaNti AsHaNti.......,what can i say about this album?hmm...not to be rude or anything but im not feelin this one at all. the first album was a whole lot better. there's too many slow tempo songs and not enough up. im not sayin dont get this album but i highly recommind that you preview first before buying it....
1,another Corny Set from this overhyped Artist,it's funny how a 10nth grade Musical 3rd-tier Runner-Up on a Talent Show Level is Proclaimed as something as Ashanti gets called.tired Writing&Her Vocals are truly Wack.some of the Music ain't bad but Ashanti's vocals are as flat as Hot Cakes.standards truly have changed when someone as Musically out of everything Musically as Ashanti gets any Hype.Her&Brittney Spears are like First Cousins of Being Wack Singers&Artists.
2,very disappointed,"I was anticipating another Grammy nominated/winning album. I was really feeling her first album. Ashanti is one of the most promising new generation female artists out there. Until her next album, I recommend downloading or burning this album...it's not worth standing in line for and paying out of your pocket."
2,Nice try but....,"This cd is a waste of money.It does not give her voice any credit. The songs are poor there are only 3 maybe 4 decent songs on this whole entire album.All the skits do nothing but pad the album. With better material, more voice training she can be a good singer. Right now, she's just a studio singer.I am mad that I brought this album. I wanted to give her a chance because she's a newer singer and the first album was decent but this album goes the range of the other sophmore albums by new artist.WEAK AS ALL H-LL!"
1,i have to give her 1 star,"but I don't want to. There is ONE good song on the CD (Rain on Me). Ashanti, the self-proclaimed Princess of hip hop and r&b, should take the head phones off and LISTEN to the crap she put on this CD. The CD is garbage flat out, straight up. There is not a good thing that I can say except that this CD is the real reason they make STOP buttons on CD players."
3,Chapter II- (minus),"Hello,i'm a bit dissatisfied by Ashantis new album. You must listen to it everyday to like it. If Ashanti would cancel her contract with Murder Inc and work together with other artist...its for sure that this 3. album would be better!!!!!! She has more talent than she could show on Murder Inc.My favorite songs are: I found lovin, rock wit u, then ya gone and rain on me!i hope i could help u!Ciao...!"
1,Chapter -2,"This was another album i review without it getting pubblished here so i'll try again.Ashanti was praised as the new queen of hip hop after her first album and i though she would do something much more mature and stronger this time but she didn't, instead this new chapter is even worse and childish then her first album, the beats are bad, the hooks are not existing and the lyrics are too predictable and corny. This album was rushed and the new rapper appearing was even worse then Ja Rule, Ashanti needs to start from scrath get herself some decent songwriter and producer, like the Neptunes perhaps before she can get her respect back, this album was really silly. Sorry im not feeling it at all."
3,its okay,"the cd is good but the only thing that gets on my nerves is that Rock Wit U song. she just say ""Aww Baby"" too much for me. But i like that ""rain on me"" song."
2,Eh....its ok...,"I felt her first album was much better. The tracks on this album other than ""Rock with You"" aren't really that great. I love Ashanti and I know she could have done better."
1,AWWWWWWWWW....zzzz boring!!,"Worst album ever. No talent, no good producers, and little kids that buy this stuff will keep this up people. Don't waste your money on this junk. Buy Lil' Mo's new album, trust me you won't be disappointed! Oh yeah p.s. she says baby in the song Rock wit u(Awwww Baby) like 65 times!!! What does that tell you? NO originality!!!"
2,UGH...,ASHANTI NEEDS DR.DRE! ... THIS ALBUM IS LIKE THE FIRST...NO ORIGINALITY! LIMITED VOCAL CAPABILITY! .... FOR FUTURE REFERENCE DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM ASHANTI W/IRV AS THE PRODUCER YOU WILL BE [DISAPPOINTED]
2,chapter 2 PU,"look this is what NOT to do when you make a cd, every track is just her singing over a backdrop of a throwback song, her voice isnt what you call spectacular so it doesnt really work for her and everyone that says that like it, is not for her voice, but just those throwback samples mostly, what she needs are new and creative beats like ""baby"" that represents her.just throwing her voice around on samples is not going to cut it for a singer. i knew they were going to blow her 2nd cd."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,what happen to the days when you got a r&b album and for the most part it was new sounding tracks? You expect when you get a rap/hip hop cd to have beats that are familer that is how it started. But when i get a cd that every song is the same beat of a older song just new lyrics? This is why i can't be buying cd's full price. Im sorry this cd is junk. At first i was trying to like it but i can't get with a cd that has no orignal beats! The only song i like is Awww baby and that is it. Don't buy this cd if you want to here it have someone burn it for you before you waste your money. Enough said.
1,This is just plain terrible!,"Oh Ashanti, what have you done? This is not a very good follow-up to your first album. I was very very disappointed by the sound of this album. Could you please lay off the skits and the terrible lyrics. I am sorry, but I this has to be the worst album I have heard this year. I hope she spends more time on her next album before releasing it."
2,Skip this chapter,"This CD is so-so. There are a couple songs I like, including ""Rain on me"" and ""Then ya gone"" (which has a good message with lyrics like ""See, everyday we complain about lil ups and downs/ We needa be thanking the lord that we're still around/ U gotta live everyday as if its ya last one""). Since most of the songs aren't catchy, don't have good lyrics or beats, you're forced to pay attention to Ashanti's singing, or lack thereof. It's not good. The tracks I mentioned would be sooooo much better if they were sung by someone with a really good voice like Mariah or Christina, but, nonetheless, they're still good. The only other song I like on this album is the first single from this CD, ""Rock wit U (aww baby)"". She does say ""awww baby"" way too much, though. Her voice sounded better on her debut album. Or maybe I didn't notice her voice because the songs were good."
3,Just Average,"Aiight so I love Ashanti and think she's awesome her first album was amazing and all of the feature work she did was rockin' but this new album in no way measures up to what her last album was. I am extremely easy to please as far as music is concerned and my first impression is normally the best before I start to get used to the songs. Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many skits, only a few of the songs have new original beats, and alot of the songs are kinda boring. Breakup 2 Makeup is good, Carry On is great and so is the Story of 2 but other then that alot of the songs are good but not what I'd expect from my girl. When I first got it I listened to the whole thing through 2 times and was close to burning a copy and cracking it so I could bring it back to the store and get a different CD."
1,Horrible!!!,"This CD is Horrible! Not More comments... Please don't waste your money and your time with this! Listen to Beyonce and Mary J. Blige, this girls are the best!!!"
1,Ummm,"First of I would like to say that well she really CAN NOT write. The lyrics are so childish and high school even my 16 year old cousin could top em. For example ""i think i like how your body feels next me""(then the horrible awww baby) c'mon anybody could write that. Geez i could write a couple of her songs and probably have more hits than the songs on this album. Well her singing needs better tuning and the producers just plain [stink] on this album. I'm not hatin but just giving advice on how this artist could stay longer in the game. Because we all know that in a few years she will be ""old news"", if she continues in this path of destruction!"
1,THIS IS NOT MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all, we all know that she cannot sing, and she isn't capable of doing more than singing hooks. Secondly, about half of her songs are sampled from artists like Issac Hayes (Rain On Me), and other old school R&B hitmakers. Third, her lyrics are horrible. Does her vocabulary include any words other than ""baby"" (ie. her third single ""Baby"" sampled from Scarface's ""Mary Jane"" included on her debut album, ""Rock Wit U, Aww Baby"" from this album, and ""Sweet Baby"" on this album)???? Besides all that, the cd has too many skits and the second track isn't even a song!! I do not understand what all the hype is over her!!!! Chink Santana and Irv Gotti have no originality and make her worse than she already is. If she wasn't cute she would be a nobody. I think she would at least be listenable if she had better production and somebody else to write her lyrics. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!! PLEASE!!!!"
2,Once again...a pretty face but no talent.,"I finally broke down and bought this album after I fell in love with Ashanti's latest single ""Rain on Me"". It's the best song on the album. Ashanti's singing is atrocious but the song itself makes up for her weak singing (after reading some of the reviews I find out even that song is sampled). Someone with a little more soul like Mary J. Blige would have done it justice. The other tracks on the album just make me wish I would have kept my $13.00 in my pocket. Ashanti's ""Ghetto Fabulous"" first album is a better buy and this is a total departure from that. This sounds like an effort to be appealing to a more mainstream pop audience."
3,WHY?!,"ok..WHY does every song sound the same..I mean on the first album, she didn't have slow slow songs, and here she does, and that's not something her voice is very well with. The upbeat songs all sound the same. I think she needs to break free from a controlling IrV Gotti who thinks he needs to produce, direct, arrange, etc...every murder inc. video, song, and what not, and experiement with other artists and producers. I'll give Irv props, cuz he is a good producer, but when he continously produces for the same artist, it gets old. Thankfully i got to preview the cd before purchasing, and I am glad i did. The album isn't horrible, but it isn't wonderful...shoulda taken another year, to work on the album, too soon from the old album, and the same old flava..If she hit us with something wow, and out there it would have given the album a uniqueness and edge...but she didn't, so that's why it's plain, and sounds the same...hoefully she'll do better next time around..."
1,"If I could rate below a 1 star, then I would!!!!","This cd was garbage. Nothing on this cd was worth listening to. Let alone Ashanti can't sing, the music was ugh. that's all im gonna say."
2,Terrible!,"I can't believe that they are comparing this girl to Mary J. Blige! Mary is the Queen, Ashanti isn't even royalty! This album was rushed and and it shines. There are 2-3 ok songs, the rest is verbal direah(however u spell it lol)! She has 0 talent. The only thing that I like is her persoanality, she seems real cool. But when it comes to singo=ing- no, and this album, an even bigger NO!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Boring Garbage,"her music was boring to begin with and this album is even more boring. I have a few words to describe it ""regular radio fare"". Nothing really special, nothing catchy, beyonce is ten times better. hell, even britney spears' album is better than this boring mediocre garbage!"
1,Can I give it zero stars? STOP THE MADNESS!,"Guess what everyone? I wrote a song!! Ready?? Here goes:""Awwww baby....ohhhh...oooh, awww baby.... I'm in love.... I'll stay forever.....never leave....do it again.... ooooh, ohhhh, awww baby..."" Wasn't that the next #1 hit? I didn't think so. STOP THE MADNESS!! Ashanti, Beyonce, all of you beatiful women who CAN'T write meaningful lyrics to save your lives... go into modeling! Stop ruining the music industry! No wonder people don't want to buy CD's anymore!!"
1,She stole Jay Zs song and made a crap version of it,This girl does not get much from me the princess of R&BI Laugh she does not sing and she turnd Down another Classof 03 Graduate LeBron James this is crap before she sampledBiggie now she is sampling Jay next she will sample my fist
1,"Oh My Gosh, Talk About Garbage","This CD blows. All the tracks have lame beats and the lyrics are pathetic. The only two ""normal"" songs are Rock Wit You and Rain On Me.....oh what a coincidence - THE ONLY TWO SINGLES RELEASED. The rest is crap. No wonder she left it and decided to move onto her next recording album. Irv Gotti is a horrible writter/producer.Why would I want to support an artist who doesn't even support her own album?PS The interludes are so dumb....I wonder if she even realizes how pointless they are. Talk about a Janet Jackson wannabe. I know....how sad, huh?"
2,shouldve been better,"i loved ashanti's 1st cd, but this one did not touch it in my opinion. 1st, too many skits and too much talking. alot of artist have gotten carried away with that. i buy a cd for music not to hear your messages. one maybe two are ok but this was just overkill. alot of featured artist and rap too, which is fine, but there was a whole lot! she is a strong enough artist she dont need all of that to sell cds she can shine on her own and i wanted to hear ashanti not everyone else. i did like the remake of the ugk song though. this cd was nothing like her 1st one which i liked, i didnt feel much ashanti in it, i thought it was just me but a couple of my friends got it and they all felt the same way. I expected alot of this cd and i was waiting patiently for it and it wasnt all that i expected, there were alot of good quality lyrics that i could feel on ashanti but not this one."
1,Murder Inc is dead,"I was never impressed by the label and most definitely not by the artists if they can be called that. Ja Rule hollared his way through a year of success and is now nowhere to be found at the higher end of the charts. A clear example of what a sad and fickle state the music industry is in. Enter Ashati, who's debut album caused much unwarranted hype, with a vocal range that does not even catagorize her as a ""singer"" and elementry lyrics. How many times can one stand to hear baby? Even with all this working against the album ""I Found Lovin"" and ""Rain On Me"" and decent tracks thanks to studio production."
2,"It could of been better, but she kind of over produced it","She definitely over-produced this album with constants sayings of 'baby' and her voice gets annoying after a while. She is a good singer, but she will never be the singer like Christina or Whitney Houston likes, her voice is not all that powerful to have me blown away like Whitney and Christina does.A couple of problems with this album: constant sayings of 'baby', her annoying singing voice, and a couple of tracks on there just make you want to take the CD out and burn it, and you wouldnt take a piss on it to put out a fire.The album is filled with guest apperances from rappers in the background, and that kind of made me a little sicking of listening to them also and Ashanti. If you want to get this album, then go right ahead, but remember I warned you."
2,***Yawn***,"OK this isnt as great as her debut album ""Ashanti"" but this is one huge amazingly cool album only like 4 songs ruin it like ""Shanys World"" but definitley I totally reccomend it I bought Beyonce's ""Dangerously In Love"" and I didnt really like it,the songs ont hat album are boring anyways I've got more fave songs on ""Chapter II"" than ""Dang..In..Luv"" come on ppl fuss over Beyonce and not Ashanti anymore I think that needs to change.GO ASHANTI!.The Stand ot songs on this album are ""Rock Wit U (aaaaww baby....)"" and ""Breakup2Makeup"",and ""Rain On ME"" I say try this out and if its not you check out Beyonces album and that wont do 4 u either (well it totally didnt 4 me)I edit this review now and say that this album has gotten so boring it dosent even deserve 2 stars. Beyonce's Cd is starting to sound better :("
3,A Roughly Written Chapter,"I love her same-titled debut album, and ""Rock with U"" soundslike Ashanti can still maintain the same quality, but after Ibought this album, I think I am somewhat fooled by her firstsingle from Chapter II.There are still some tracks catch my ears, such as ""Rain onMe"", ""Then Ya Gone"", ""Living My Life"", ""Feel So Good"", ""SweetBaby"", and ""I Don't Mind"". But what the rest tracks are about?No points, no tunes, even seem to be unfinished.Hope she can publish a more delicate chapter next time."
4,Good for the soul,"In contrast to the first cd, this cd is more soul than ever before. The melody is more of a romantic touch where jazz and r&b have become the main players. Chapter II is more soul which compliments the first cd which was more hip hop, instead this cd has become more vocally involved and it would be recommended for those that love jazz and r&b. The cd overall was great and has obviously been more lyrically involved than just having the words ""baby"" in it."
2,It's not as good as I thought it would be!!!!!,"Ashanti dose have a little talent, I give her that but I really thought she should of waited to release this album don't get me wrong it's alright I like 3 songs but it needs some more work. She needs to do a album wit different people people besides Ja'Rule and tha Mudra Inc fam maybe if she did that people would think of her betta. She also needs to write her own songs and stop doing remakes it's gettin boring!!!!! I'm not hatin on her but you can't get mad at tha truth! O yea she needs a dance teacher and get rid of them same moves if you wanna hear a album listen to Beyonce's Dangerously in Love or Mya's MoodRing."
2,...And this album was #1???,"What happened, Ashanti? I expected so much from this album because, surprisingly, I really liked the last one. I thought her follow-up would be a lot better than the first (even though she can't sing). I was VERY disappointed. IT WOULD BE IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.... Get Beyonce, Mya, or even Monica instead."
2,"Don't bother buying this one, just download it!","Who told Irv Gotti he was the new DJ Clue? Stop talking over the beats fool. You cannot take anything away from the voice and vocal stylings of Ashanti. Hands down the girl can sing. What detracts from this CD are her cohorts at Murder Inc, you know the guys with little or no talent, namely Irv Gotti, and Chin Santana. Irv, just keep playing the background man. Your vocals add absolutely nothing to the effort. If this album had any more samples and interpolations on it, they would have to rename it to the remake album. Leave the sampling game to Mary J Blige. She and the team she has surrounding her do a much better job. I thought this was Hip-Hop/R&B man. Ashanti, when your contracts up you should seriously consider bolting for higher ground. Work with some true professionals. Babyface has tons of stuff on ice for you I am willing to bet on it. And Chink Santana, I bet you go Double Copper!"
1,Get it together Ma!!!!!!(Would give it -5 stars if I could),"OMG Shani.?????.Ashanti ..Murder who? Pleeze go somewhere..This album is WACK!! She cannot sing she cannot dance..I cannot even beleive she has a fan base.EEK!!! What is the world coming to giving these non-talented ppl record deals? This is by far one of the WORST R&B albums ever to be released on planet earth..!!!! Princess of R&B ??????..Don't make me puke..the only good song is ""Rain On Me."""".I'll give her that..From start to finish this album is ear torture..Do yourself a favor and avoid this album like the bubonic plague. Buy Aaliyah(Aaliyah) Beyonce(Dangerously In Love) or Brandy's (Afrodisiac) album instead...I really hope this is the final chapter from her!!!!!!"
1,this CD is fantastic,if you're a little girl who hasn't been exposed to real music and only listen to ashanti only because all your friends do.
4,Better than the first CD,"I was a little skeptical about buying this CD because the reviews weren't too good. I'm glad I went with my own judgement because I absolutely LOVE this CD. She has a lot of old school beats that you can definitely feel and her writing skills has improved. The only reason why I didn't give this CD a 5 is because of those stupid skits she has on it. She could've definately left those out, but Ashanti keep doing your thing girl."
2,"Please make this the ""Final Chapter"".","Okay, Ashanti has some catchy ass hooks on the radio and everything, but um, I think this album is quite boring! Just about all the songs on this album are slow. The only good songs on this album are the ones that were released on the radio. This princess has definitely fallen off of her throne. She is too overated. I don't even know whose idea it was to call HER that anyways, oh yeah I forgot it was Ja Rule, which is another lame. Anyways if you want an album worth your money, don't buy this one."
1,NO TALENT!,"Well of course every body knows Ashanti Cannot sing, for me i have no idea why she in the music industry!She has a very ugly image about her!She trys to copy other artist like Aaliyah BUT there is just no comparison!AND whats with all the interludes and skits!By far this woman has no talent so I reccommend u dont by this CD bcause you will waste your money!"
2,Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,"Can someone please tell Ashanti to stop rhyming krazy with baby.I think if she worked with people who knew what the hell to do with R&B music,it would be good.But instead her main producer is Irv Gotti!Mister extasy pill man.I loved her first album.Maybe the album failed because she didn't have seven(a hot produce who isn't with foolish murder inc,i'm sorry the inc).I'm so upset coz I know she can do better.And I think she needs to get outta murder inc because the label is goin' down.And so is she!"
2,No Vocals,"Ashanti is beautiful and all, but she can't sing. She proves this well in the first single Rock U Baby (Awww Baby). She cant hit that ever so needed high note that a true soul diva uses to get the crowd hot. She did win some points with the second single Rain on me, Thats a much better song than Rock U Baby. So if u want a female with a true voice get Mary J. Blige or Heather Hedleys albums."
3,NOT ASHANTI'S BEST,"I DEFINITELY BELIEVE HER FIRST ALBUM IS BETTER THAN HER SECONDONE,EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE THE SAME MAKEUP(SAMPLING). THE BESTSONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE...ROCK WIT U(NICE BASS BEAT),RAIN ON ME(SUBTLE,RAINY-DAY GROOVE),U SAY,I SAY(THE KEYS ARE GREAT) ANDLAST I DON'T MIND(A LITTLE SOMETHING DIFFERENT,BUT SEXY).I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING REALLY GREAT-MAYBE SHE'LL TEAM UPWITH MISSY OR TIMBALAND NEXT TIME AND LEAVE CHINK AND IRV ALONE."
3,Ashanti's Songs on this Album Are Great!,"First of all, if you say you are disappointed with this album, you shouldn't be. Ashanti's great voice and unique hip-hop rhythm helps make this CD a good one. The songs on this album maintain in tact and you can move to the beat. Ashanti made this album a great one, and I think most of you out there would agree with me. The beats are fantastic, the vibes are going, and this CD is a success! Ashanti is a favorite of mine, and she is praised for her awesome R+B singing. If you bought the album, I hope you enjoy it!"
4,Ashanti,"Why do people all diss on ashanti? I am not a big fan, but I think this is a nice cd GO PICK ON BRITNEY SPEARS"
3,Pleasing.....,"Ashanti, the name we always hear in the R&B world...... First off, I will say that her first album failed to impress me.. but the second album... I feel it is an impressive sophomore release but, Ashanti has a long way to go as an artist. The vocals are decent, she has a good voice. Some of my fav. songs are:1. ""Rock Wit' You (Awww Baby)"" although she is stuck on ""Awww Baby, Oooh Baby"" 3/52. ""Break Up 2 Makeup""- one of the best!!, although I think it is a remake. 5/53. ""I Found Lovin'""- One of the best!! (A remake though)5/54. ""Rain On Me""- The best track!! 5/55. ""Feels So Good""- A decent track! 5/56. ""Carry On""- Decent. 4/57. "" The Story of 2""- remake of ""Dream Maker"" 5/5Overall, Chapter II is a decent release that I think could grow on you..... It certainly grew on me!"
1,AALIYAH VS ASHANTI,"Sorry Ashanti, Theres only ONE AALIYAH. Wethere shes with us or not AALIYAH will always be higher then u. Juss common sense. Theres only one queen and princess in this game, Mary J and Aaliyah. Aaliyah was and will always be a better dancer, vocalist, bussiness woman, dresser, talented and of course she was ALOT PRETTIER. More classy with that sexy look. Juss like her music. Latez oh and i really aint 12 juss didnt have a account, so used a kids one! lmao laterz"
1,i would hate to finish this book,"the c.d. is annoying. too many skits. Listen to the tracks, she doesn't sing in 3 of them. and when she does, u don't want her to."
1,Save your Money,"Chapter II is even worse than her first CD, whack vocals, childish lyrics and more old school samples. She really needs to reconsider her musical career"
1,"Why someone wants to hear ""Baby"" a 1,000 times ???","WHACK GARBAGE. THANK GOD I DON`T WASTE MY MONEY ON THIS TRASH. SOMEONE IN A LABORATORY CLASS(WHERE U CAN HEAR MUSIC), PUT IT ON ALL THE WAY AND ALL THE PEOPLE THERE TELL THE GUY THAT PUT IT TO STOPPED IT NOW OR IT WILL BE SOME VIOLENCE. JAJAJA...I`M NOT JOKING PROBABLY I HEARD THE WORD ""BABY"" ABOUT 1,000 TIMES IN THIS GARBAGE. ASHANTI HAVE NO TALENT, BUT HAVE A LOT OF HAIR IN HIS BODY FOR A WOMAN...UGHHHH !!! I DON`T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE`S ON EVERYWHERE. NO TALENT, NO VOICE, A LOT HAIR...AND NO NOTHING.DON`T WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS PIECE OF CRAP...PLEASE...!!!"
3,better than the last,U could tell she had vocal training this time around..and at least not all the tracks are lifted from someone elses album. 10 more albums down the road and she may be average
1,DIDN'T WE LEARN ANYTHING FROM PAST RELEASES????,"I cannot believe that somebody like Ashanti is having another album out and some people is actually buying it!Didn't we learn anything from her first solo effort ""Ashanti""?Her singing skills still as bad as they were a year ago.Her and her producers still sampling old school songs.My 7-year-old cousin could write better songs than her.Want advice? SAVE YOUR MONEY"
1,would u please stop singing as a solo artist?,"i feel like the music business now needs some serious filtration. seems like everyone can be a singer as long as there's a powerful organization behind him/her. ashanti doesn't have a bad voice, but it's not good enough to be a solo artist. she should stick with singing choruses for rap songs. her first single off this album is one of the most annoying songs ever. from beginning to end, u hear ""aww baby"" about 1000 times! i've given the song several chances but, still, cannot stand it and i've never finished listening to the whole song. it'd probably be one of the shortest songs ever if u removed all the repetitions. sigh... don't know why she's famous, and especially the first single..............................."
4,IS THIS REALLY ASHANTI?,"When her first album came out, it became one of my favorites!! Then I thought her 2nd c.d was gonna be even better..but was I wrong! ;( Her styles changed when it came to the songs, but all in all I felt like it wasn`t really ""Ashanti."" I liked her old style, this ""new"" her I'm not really feelin...But I guess this cd is okay..love her voice :)"
2,TRY AGAIN ASHANTI,"THIS ALBUM WAS A HUGE LET-DOWN! EVEN THOUGH ASHANTI IS NOT A VERY GOOD (LIVE) SINGER HER 1ST ALBUM WAS WORTH BUYING! UNLIKE THE FIRST ALBUM, I SUGGEST U SAVE YOUR MONEY! I RATED THE SONGS FROM 1-5 (HIGHEST)1. Intro/Medley2. Shany's World - (featuring Chink Santana) (ANOTHER INTRO)3. Rock Wit U (Awww Baby) (4/5)4. What Are The Gonna Say Now - (skit)5. Breakup 2 Makeup (5/5)6. I Found Lovin'(3/5)7. Rain On Me (10/5)8. Then Ya Gone - (featuring Chink Santana) (1/5)9. Living My Life (2/5)10. Black Child - (skit)11. Feels So Good (2/5)12. Carry On (1/5)13. Sugar Shack, The - (skit)14. Story Of 2 (4/5)(IT'S AN OLD SCHOOL RE-MAKE)15. Ohhh Ahhh (3/5)16. Shany Shia (SKIT)17. Sweet Baby (1/5)18. U Say, I Say (2/5)19. I Don't Mind (3/5)20. Outro - (featuring Chink Santana) SKIT"
2,Pretty Bad,"The first Ashanti CD was really good, so I was really excited about the new one. But after listening to the CD a few times, its easy to say that it is not very good. There are only two good songs on the entire thing, number 3 and 15. The music is corny, the lyrics lack any substance, and the songs sound really fake and forced. I feel bad giving Ashanti a bad review, but this album just isn't worth the money. ..."
3,"Good, but Could Have Been Better","The songs are pretty good. I like them. Well, most of them. The only thing that holds this album back is all those darn interludes. I'm the kind of music fan who likes to pop in a CD and start hearing the music. With this album though, you have to listen to two LONG interludes before you even get to the first song! And then, after that one song, you get ANOTHER skit. And using Ashanti's album to promote another Murder Inc. artist? For shame, Irv Gotti."
3,"People, She's Not Really That Bad!","I'm not saying Ashanti is Mariah Carey, but she DOES have SOME talent."
2,Wow,"This is just a bad album. I was behind Ashanti on ""Chapter I,"" but I don't know what this garbage is. Granted, there are 2 good songs (""Rock Wit U"" and ""Rain On Me"") and two other decent songs that could've been better, but the album is not good. Seriously, don't waste your money on this CD, because obviously, Ashanti didn't put any money into it..."
3,"Blah, boring and generic.","Ashanti has a lot of talent, and I look forward to Concrete Rose after hearing Only U on the radio. Anyway, this album is very generic and I could pick up any blah CD an it would be pretty much the same thing. Ashanti sings her songs striaght-forward, and that's good, but it gets boring after awhile. Ashanti's lyrics, however, are great. They are all about her personality, which gave this album a great mood for summer, though, it's still pretty generic. So, if you like generic R&B sometimes boring albums, buy this."
4,Mature Ashanti,"This is better than her first album, her style changes in almost every song. She bought back the old songs and beats."
3,It's decent,"This cd is pretty decent.Its more for the days where your are in that laid back chill zone.Most of the songs on this CD are lovey songs.Ashanti is not as bad as people say she is. I've personally loved her since the beginning but this was the first CD of hers thats i bought. I would give this CD a perfect 5 stars but there are too many interruptions such as skits,Irv Gotti, Irv Gotti shoutouts from Irv Gotti, too much Irv Gotti saying how beautiful n yadiyadiya Ashanti is. Also this song is not for any mood that you may feel.Its directed to us (ladies) n Ashanti's love life. Though it does feature some up-tempo or more up-tempo beats i should say on songs such as Makeup's 2 Breakup's , Rock Wit U, and I found Lovin.On a scale of 10 I would give this CD a 6. Do yo thing Ashanti.-----------P.S.----as I speak, Im listening to the CD and guess who's talking............GOTTI!"
4,nice,"I think that Ashanti is great preformer,lyric writer and artist. All of her songs are great.But I hate those skits, intros & outros , they've kinda made album worse . Without skit it would be 5 stars.I really like her voice and the way she sings . She is showing us what is real r'n'b. ....(...)"
3,Doesn't even compare to the first,"I really like Ashanti, but this c.d. just doesn't cut it. There are a couple catchy tracks, but even those don't have much substance and her voice doesn't sound as good as on her first album. On almost all of them I end up goin to the next track half-way through the one I'm listening to. Her debut was amazing, I can listen to that all the way through, without even touching any buttons, because every song is actually *really good*. Hopefully this is just a sophomore slump and her next album won't be mediocre, but more like the first one. I can tell you one thing though, Beyonce's album is CRAZY GOOD...if you are going to spend your money on one album, make it hers. Also, Monica's is very impressive."
1,AWWWWful ashanti!!!!!!!!!!,"ASHANTI is by far the worst singer on the face of this galaxy... why is this alien here on earth trying to get us to by its music>? nobody wants to rock with anything she got.....i am not going to lie i did buy the first cd because of the first single but when i found out she was going to win such awards as artist of the year and best r and b and the person cannot sing at all.....CHAPTER II is the worst r and b album to date. the first single ""rock with u (awww baby): made me throw up and cry!!!!!! when i found out she was doing a remake of the michael jackson classic with the same title no awwwwww baby....well not to make every1 mad but i jsut dont like her at all... do not buy her music it is a waste of money time and life..."
2,Mary J. Blige she is not!,"Normally i don't buy a CD after hearing one song, but considering how much I liked Rock wit U and her first album, I figured that buying Chapter II would be a good bargain. Boy, was I wrong. Ashanti is considered the ""princess of R&B;"". And while I'm not sure if that's the truth, she is trying to be way too soulful on this album. Ashanti, stick to R&B;, and let Mary J. Blige handle hip-hop and soul.How dare someone compare this album to Mary's ""My Life""? That album has feelings, emotions... you can actually feel Mary pour out her heart and soul onto those records. And since she's my favorite artist, I'm a little picky when it comes to someone compared to her.Despite her short-comings (and extremely annoying skits), I'll still give the album 3 stars. I dont see her coming out with another video unless she does some remix, since most of the songs are slow (or just not worth being mainstream)."
3,"Well, for the most part the album should be called ""Remake""","1.)There are about 7 Intros, Outros, Skits on the album.2.)The Media says, that her new song ""Rock Wit U"" is not sampled but upon hearing the Instrumental, there is small parts that sample's M. Jacksons, identicaly titled hit.3.)There are 2many samples, (""Breakup 2 Makeup""-Mary's Sweet Thing.),( ""I Found Lovin""-I Know that beat from somewhere.) (Then on ""Livin My Life"", she takes the beat straight from R.kelly's ""Been around the World Ft. Ja Rule.)(She even samples herself on ""Feel So Good"" harmonizing her hits ""Happy"" and ""Rock Wit U""),( ""The Story of 2"" whole thing straight up tooken from Angela Bofill's ""Dream Maker"")~But After listening to this album a couple of times, I cant help liking it."
2,Ashanti wut were u thinkin?!,I personally loved most of the songs on Ashanti's debut album but this one took terrible to a whole new level and gave the word disappointing a whole new definition for me. Ashanti has a decent voice and I know she's capable of making better music than this! The only song on here that I can tolerate is Rock Wit U. I bought this album figuring that there are enough tracks on it that I would like at least three or four more in addition to the first single but I was wrong. I won't sell my copy or use it as a coaster because although it won't see the light of day anytime soon I still might one day decide to give it a second listen.
2,no better than the first,"rock wit u and rain on me are the only ok songs, she shows a little bit of vocal improvement on rain on me, but her performance skills are not great at all. I saw her singing rock wit u on BET swaying around and if it wasn't for her mixing it with michael jackson's rock with you, she would have gotten booed for it. The Rain On Me video is alright though."
1,Wack Big Time....,Crap! Why did I even bought this album. Its trash really. Her debut was much better. You'll get sick listening to this LP cuz its very wack. The productions are so wack.Her first single Rock Wit U is such a turn-off. And Rain On Me is lame! Anyways DON't buy this album cuz its not worth it. Only for tone deaf Ashanti fans.
1,This cd made me vomit on my versace gown,"ashanti tries too hard to be something that she is not, being a good singer. She attempts to prove that she has a strong voice in the skit Shany Shia, but tries too hard and only sounds that she is a cat in heat. The annoying gangster feel to the album is much alarming to the fact that she is a tryhard. Who would want to listen to such garbage. I could have strancgled a cat instead of buying this album and still would have felt as though i had listened to this album, and not have wasted my money."
2,Too Bad,"Honestly, there are 3 songs I sort of, kinda like on the album and they are: ""Breakup 2 Makeup"", ""Rain on Me"", and ""Then ya Gone"". Now when I say I sort of, kinda like these songs I mean they are at the very least melodic and have a point. But really, I listen to them only as a background sound when I'm at my desk at work, so I'm not *really* listening you know what I mean. This cd was actually pretty terrible. She is known for saying baby too much throughout her songs and it's true (on the 3 songs I picked she doesn't say it so much). It's very annoying and can make you angry actually. I don't know about her 1st one, some other reviewers seem to have liked it better but oh well, I'm definitely NOT a fan."
2,ASHANT WHATS GOIN ON ????,I DONT KNOW WHATS GOIN ON WITH ASHANTI SHE GOT TO MANY SKITS TO MANY INTRO'S THE SONGS ON THE CD ALL SAY THE SAME THING OUT OF 20 SONGS THERE ARE ONLY GOOD 5 ONES WHICH ARE ROCK WIT U (AWWW BABY) RAIN ON ME I DON'T MIND BREAKUP TO MAKEUP I FOUND LOVIN THE REST OF THE CD IS HORRIBLE I WAS REALLY DISSAPOINTED WHEN I GOT THIS ALBUM CAUSE I LOVED HER DEBUT ALBUM SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT CD GET THAT CD. BUT IF YOU WANT THIS CD SUPPORT ASHANTI MAYBE YOULL LIKE IT
3,All them damn skits dont make no damn sense......,"When I first listened to this album,it was sooooooo boring,my lord it was,I was beginning to think,this album is horrible,but its not that horrible,but all them dang skits,dont make no dang sence,so I took off 1 star for that.But her album is alright.I still think her 1st album was betta than this.1. Intro/Medley -2. Shany's World - (featuring Chink Santana)3. Rock Wit U (Awww Baby)- 5/54. What Are The Gonna Say Now - (skit)5. Breakup 2 Makeup - 4/56. I Found Lovin' - 4/57. Rain On Me - 5/58. Then Ya Gone - (featuring Chink Santana) - 5/59. Living My Life - 4/510. Black Child - (skit)11. Feels So Good - 5/512. Carry On - 4/513. Sugar Shack, The - (skit)14. Story Of 2 - 4/515. Ohhh Ahhh - 3/516. Shany Shia17. Sweet Baby - 5/518. U Say, I Say - 3/519. I Don't Mind -3/520. Outro - (featuring Chink Santana)"
4,Awwww baby,"Well, Ashanti has done it again! Although this cd may not be as good as the first, it's still worth the $$$. Rock Wit U is by far my fav song on the album...it's my summer song at the moment...I luv cruisin with it on. Breakup2 makeup, I Found Lovin', and Then Ya Gone are also favs i have on this cd. If u luv Ashanti and her angelic voice, this is a must buy cd. If you're expecting there to be lots of rap on this album like the last, you're out of luck though. There's no Ja Rule on this album. [Santana] is the only rapper on this cd, and unlike the last cd, the swear words are edited out of this one. All in all though, this cd is rockin and is gonna be my summer cd."
4,Better then the first one!,I have been a Ashanti fan since her first cd. I got this cd the day it came out. I was not disappointed at all. I was actually surprised. She shows more of her vocal skills. She is very talented. Her song are all easy all relate too because we are either in that siutation or have been there done that so we understand. I do not like the skits that she has they are useless. That is the only reason why she gets 4 out of 5 stars. In addition to Ashanti I would recommend Beyonce's cd. They are both very talented and in the music industry there is enough room for both of them.
3,Itz Aight,Whats up Yall! This Ashanti cd could have been alot better 4real! She rushed to put this album out and truly it got some okay cuts on there but otherwise its defintely not as good as the first one. I mean if you like Ashanti and you wanna get the album then cool but otherwise I wouldn't suggest it!
2,poor,"Ashanti 2nd album lacks substance, with very few noteworthy songs from the so called princess of hip hop and rnb. i feel like ashanti maximised her talent on her 1st Lp, her latest offering does not compare favourably too other female star releases like beyonce, monica and mya.The problem with ashanti is she does not have a striking voice and this puts more pressure on her song writing skills, that are sadly lacking on this album."
1,Chapter II hmm not very exciting,"I expected it to be better, but to my surprise it was just bad. The songs just are boring and seem all alike execpt Rock wit u which is probably the highlight of the album, but even that song isn't that impresive. She could've done a better job at this or maybe her producers should've. Her first album being a better effort while this one isn't really worth the money. Ashanti could've also done a better job in her vocals also. In her first album they were better, but i still think she needs to choose what style of music she can sing better with cause the way she is going just ain't cuttin it."
3,Ehh....Wasn't expecting it like that,"Ashanti is a great singer and no doubt one of this generation's break out artists but this CD just didn't do it for me...i was expecting more after the success of her first CD with hits like ""Foolish"", ""Happy"", etc...There were only 3 songs i really liked on here and of course her latest single ""rock wit u"" is one of them. I juss wish there was more of that magic and girl next door - baby girl thug appeal on this album. I was debating whether or not to get this album or Beyonce's....if you want more of a dance beat with personal deep lyrics Buy Beyonces album...but if u need juss some regular music if ure BORED then buy this one...sooo sorry Ashanti - Girl, i luv u...but i dont luv this album"
2,Ashanti,"I think the cd has some nice beats, but the vocals are terrible. I unfortunately would not recommend this cd."
1,Just bad !,"I have nothing against Ashanti, but she can't be better than a back-up singer. Thanks to all the hype and fan that have gone tone deaf, she is selling millions without knowing how to sing. I tried to force myself to like this CD since I spent money for it, but I couldn't help but skippig every song. I felt I was getting dumb just by listening to the lyrics. Ashanti proved that she can not improve vocally and that her song writing is as bad as her singing. To those who are thinking about buying this CD, hold your thought, and go get Blu Cantrell CD ""Bitter Sweet"". You will listen to someone who deserves all the hype."
1,I HATE HER!!,They are practically giving away record deals because she can't sing or dance. I wouldn't miss her if she left the game. BEEEOTCH!!!
1,Ehhh.....no.,"Granted that when I first heard the song ""rock wit U"" it annoyed me because of the 1,000 mentions of the word baby, it grew on me. Of course this is due entirely to the fact of the song beat and the other, if very few, words in the song. I didn't bother buying the album, I simply listened to samples of every song so I can't say for sure. However, I doubt the samples I heard stray that much from the song structures, so I still believe the rest of the songs are either crap or mediocre at best. Sad, sad album. Very disappointing when I liked numerous songs on her previous album."
1,GAR-bage,"it's that simple... same ol' production, same ol' boring melody, same ol' non-singin wannabe diva who can't compete in any arena w/ real singers like mary j, beyonce, kelly r, whitney etc."
1,Stinker...,"I expected a lot more from her, due to the quality of her first cd...there are a couple songs that are listenable, but none of them stood out at all, and I instantly regretted buying the cd...it's better to pass on this one and spend your money elsewhere"
2,talented or not,overall i'd have to give this album a two with ashanti's limited vocal talents and the effortless lyrics to some of the songs such as what are they gonna say now ect i must say this album sold mainly because of the hype surrounding it.her first album was terrific despite her lack of vocal talent.honestly the first cd should have been credited to the people who mixed the beats and the writers. overall if you ask me you'd be much happier downloading a couple of her songs or buying the singles because to pay 16.00 for the whole cd is a complete and total waste
4,awesome cd.....just 2 fault,"This cd is awesome, it has great beats, and great lyrics. ashanti really shows her range in break up to makeup, dreamaka, and shany shi. this is on of my fav. cds and i would have given it 5 stars, but there's a few faults. first of all, this .... santana person is rapping and laughing and making comments thruought the whole cd and it gets very annoying, and ruins the cd. the other problem is they advertise murder inc. way to much. they talk about how it was another ""murder inc. banger"" and they just say ""murder inc."" way too much. Talk about desperate advertising 4 their label company. but besides thoes 2 faults, this cd is perfect. go out and buy it."
1,Aaliyah Wanna Be,"I am sorry but Ashanti can't sing, :( I thought maybe it would be better then her first cause her first really sucked, this one omg, stank. She is another britney spears. A wannabe, someone who cant think for themselves. Aaliyah was real, aaliyah was her, aaliyah was awesome and wil always be, from day one. The gurl could move, ashanti, dont dance! You make urself look fatter then usuall. The dancing should be left to Aaliyah, the singing to tamia, cause tamia sings alot better too, Ashanti Killed So Into You Tamia or even Aaliyah would have or tamia did a good as job. :)"
1,ashanti's hot--c.d. not,"First I have to point this fact out. Everybody already knows if ja-rule were still hot and not getting ripped by 50cent, he would have been all over her little whack song(rock wit u) but since he has been getting vandalize, he laid back in the cut. Okay on with this 20min collection of hooks. I know Ashanti wants to write her own music, but come'on give someone else a chance at writting a couple. I think my handicapped cousin who has downs could have wrote better colletion of songs then her. Ashanti gets a big thumbs down for her writting skills. One class at the community college huh ashanti and you think you can read and write--slow down. Give the G.E.D time to work. I really don't have to much to say on ashanti. She is fine that's about it, but her music blows. Ashanti get's one thumb for trying."
1,Starting to become someone I love to hate,"Ashanti, needs samples and guests to try to be the bomb. She try's to act like a rapper as well. Well she's not a rapper and happends to be a pretty bad R&B singer too."
1,A dissappointment,"It wasn't until Rain on Me came out that I decided to get the CD dispite the poor reviews. I can honestly there is 3 or 4 songs I like on the CD including the ones that were released. Her first CD was so much better then this one. I feel that there is too much praise on the CD talking about Ashanti all that. It made it seem like she was really not humble about her success by having all this, I'm the ish on her CD from other people. It was retarded. She is okay singer. I liked her more for her writing, but I don't know about that anymore. I like Rock wit you for a minute until I noticed the repeating of the chorus constantly, it was a lack of lyrics. Mya's CD was way better. Same with Lumidee"
5,Down to Earth,"I'm not what you call the smartest guy in the neighborhood but I have to say that I found this DVD to be the most straight forward and understandable demonstration of the purpose of our Constitution ever. I now have the confidence (albeit after watching the DVD 3 times) to discuss the ""Intent"" of the Constitution with unabashed confidence with people I consider to be intellectually superior to me. If the cartoon presentation was to capture the attention of Middle School pupils then I think it will be sucessful in that endevour. If however, you expect to be visually entertained then I'm afraid you'll be a little disappointed. But if your goal is to be educated and informed about the writing of the great Document... You will not be left wanting."
5,I Am Going To Mike Church This Sunday,"This video was wonderful. I wish public (aka government) schools would really teach about the founding of this country and liberty. Unfortunately, that will never happen. I enjoyed the entire production. I do listen to Mr Church on the radio and I wish he would attract a wider audience. The acting is good. If you like special effects and gratuitous sex then this is not for you. If you like a REAL story then you NEED to buy this."
1,Great story but very poor production,"The production of this DVD is very amateurish. The animated characters are not really animated, but rather an arm or mouth moving on occasion on a stationary cardboard like figure.An elementary school project would produce a better viewing experience.The history included is fascinating, and enlightening and the audio is very good. Mike and his adorable daughters did a nice job in trying to bring history to life. Too bad this was marketed as a DVD which in and of itself is a very poor product.The content gets lost in the annoying presentation. I would recommend this for the content, but it is not a video worth buying. It should be sold as an audio disc and priced accordingly and then I would have given it 4 or 5 stars."
1,"Great idea, poor production","Anything which promotes understanding of American exceptionalism (and our Constitution plays a huge part in making us exceptional) is to be encouraged and supported.Mr. Church is to be commended for his effort here.But the presentation is unwatchable and at times absurd. Ken Burns this is not. Static cartoon characters are used to represent the Founding Fathers; only their mouths move, sporadically and puppet-like. And so it goes. The ideas are profound, the execution is dismal.Mr. Church is an exceptionally likable and intelligent man in his role as narrator, and his daughters are wonderful, kids anyone would be proud to call their own.For the ideas and history alone, the $36 dollars would be well spent if it were possible to get through the presentation. It was not."
5,"Beautifully illustrated, brought to life like never before","I wasn't really sure about what to expect with this. I'm a fan of the Mike Church show on Sirius Patriot radio. Honestly, I bought this dvd more out of curiosity than anything else but I sure am glad I made that decision. This turned out to be informative and entertaining. The artwork is fantastic and there's actually some humor thrown in as well. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to know about the ""real"" story behind the writing and ratifying of the U.S. constitution."
1,Spirit of 76- Errors!,Made a mistake by ordering Spirit of 76 so early for my son's birthday- ordered 1.5 months in advance and missed return policy. Both DVD's have errors and do not play. Sad because I was going to show to all the kids in my carpool- hoping they would learn something. Too late to return- very bummed at quality.
1,Horrible,The singing is okay but the songs are miserable. It's suprising this girl won Pop Idol because she looks like a pig.
2,Good voice but no sex appeal,"Some of these reviews are a little mean, but a Pop Idol is not just a voice, but a look as well. I hope Michelle gets the most out of this. 5/5 for the voice. 1/5 for the look."
1,The singing WALRUS.,"SO this is the winner of PLOP idol from the U.K then. Well they don't come prettier than this from Scotland I guess, that's for sure. As far as the music is concerned, AVOID! It's nothing but a calchony of crap. Perhaps Michelle should stick at something she is good at - eating chips and mars bars."
1,Oink oink! Just a pig with a micro-phone.,"This aint no Dion, or Madonna, but some over weight hippo from a loch in scotland, that struck it lucky on the uk version of Pop Idol. Michelle would do better if she started her own Pizza franchise. The McHaggis deep pan, 99"". Cause she sure as hell is an advert for em."
4,Golden oldie,"About 40 years ago, as newbie Christians, we were very interested in the ""news"" about Noah's Ark and the search for it. This was a really interesting book, and after reading it, we lent it out - as you do - and it was never returned.Now we have a grandchild who is showing the same interest and wants to look for it... (bless him!)The advantage with this particular publication is the photos; how to demonstrate the kind of task that the physical terrain of the area demands, is facilitated with the pictures in a way that smaller minds can take on board instantly.But beware, there are editions printed without the photos; make sure which one you are getting if you order online!"
4,Nice shoe for the price,"Paid $30.00 for this shoe, very tall and great looks for the price. A bit too big for my foot. I usually wear a 9 1/2 in Madden, these are a bit long for me. Good width."
1,Wrong size...item being returned.,"The service was great but the shoes shipped were not the shoe indicated on the box. The requested size was 6.5 and the actual shoe is 5.5, although the box did indicate 6.5. The shoes are being shipped back for refund."
3,not rodent proof,i have used the soil saver compost bin for 5 years now- i find it very frustrating- the pieces don't staytogether and it is definitely not rodent proof- i have a chewed up piece of the compost bin walls that has beentotally gnawed through- rendering the entire bin unusable . this bin needs to be sturdier and larger in order to beefficient- and a serious gardener would want 3 of them. any decent compost bin should hold one cubic yard of wastein order to build enough heat in the center to accelerate decomposition- i am currently looking to change these bins outand replace with a wood and wire bin.
5,A wonderful book,I enjoyed this book and DVD sooo very much...My Mother comes from Lyon Falls and reportedly was married by the the Sky Piolet so this made it even more special...The service that I recieved when buying this was wonderful as well >>>Thank you so very much
2,Can't get into it!,"This book will not let me get to the third chapter. Write like am a two year old and not one with a B.A. This writer just went all out with this college dictionary he must have. I can't tell you more right now, cause I started reading another book."
4,Slam Papi's work at his best.,Mark Smith is a great poet and the king of slam. This Chicagoland native is great
2,Wrong Dimension listed,"When selling planter trays, the seller should list the INSIDE dimension of the item as this will be the information that will help the customer make a decision as to whether or not the tray will hold their desired plant. The measurement listed is 14 inches, which is correct for the OUTSIDE lip of the tray. The inside lip is the important part, however and that dimension is not listed.Two stars for bad information, Akro-Mils!Edit to add:You can get a true-sized pan to meet your needs if you don't mind spray-painting it to match the pot:http://www.amazon.com/Fat-Daddios-Anodized-Aluminum-Square/dp/B0000VZZMM/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid;=1357394334&sr;=8-8&keywords;=square+pan+16%22"
1,Thought it was great,"I received this as a gift and loved it at first. But after using it just 3 times one of the support poles snapped when we were putting it up. I was bummed too because I loved it so much. If you do buy it, be careful when you handle it - it's not as durable as it seems."
1,WATCH OUT!!!!!,I was very excited to try out this tent at the beach. We got it set up and my 4 month old was taking a nap in it out of the sun. Everything was great until the cabana suddenly collapsed on him. One of the supports had broken. It was the first time I'd used it. I was very disappointed.
5,Four Years of Great Use!,"While looking to buy a second cabana for a relative, I read some of the reviews of the Kwik Cabana and thought I'd write my own since we have owned ours for almost four years. It has been to the beach lots of times, has been played in as a play tent both indoors and out for years, and is currently set up in our living room as a ""camping tent"" for our kids. We have an almost four year old and a one year old...both love it and play in it, together or separately. It has been put up and taken down a hundred times and has held up well. The sewing on one of the pole pockets at one of the corners of the tent came unsewn...for the moment I used a paperclip to fix it, meaning to sew the pocket later, but a year later I still haven't gotten to it and the paperclip is still there! So, we love the tent, have had great luck with its durability, and love that it is useful both inside and out year round."
2,Good in the shade,"I bought this for my infant for a trip to the beach. The sand was hot so i had to place a towel beneath the tent to shield the baby. Also, even with the mesh and the ample door opening, it still retains heat plus the light shines through (its a thin nylon material) creating a greenhouse effect. My baby was hot in there! I would place this in the shade next time I go to the beach."
2,Cabana,"This was a pain the rear to use. It was fun for the kids to play in the house, but to use it on the beach was a waste. It was a mess to clean up the sand..from the inside out."
1,Revolting.,"The plot was sickening. I felt nothing for the protagonist except disgust (And I felt ""nothing"" for the secondary characters). ""Is this a joke?"", I kept asking myself. Bringing out a book such as this takes publishing to a new low."
2,Vent Holes defeat purpose,This covers has a vent panel on each top side which allows rain to get in. Real dumb. Defeats the whole purpose. I now have another cover under the weber cover to prevent the rain from getting in. They should show a closer picure of the vents.
2,"Good Fit, but poor vent location","Fits perfectly on my Summit 650 w/ velcro on each side to help it stay put.Downside is that there are ventilation screens over each side (just above each shelf). When it rains/dews, water seeps through and you end up with spotted areas....especially if you don't often uncover and wipe it down."
2,VENTS IN THE TOP!,"THERE ARE 2 VENTS IN THE TOP OF THIS COVER, which is not reflected in the photo on the box. Water gets in and the woman in customer service advised me to ""just wipe it off when it stops raining."" What?? Needless to say, I am surprised that such a class company would create such an idiotic cover."
2,quilting hoop or emboider hoop,"This product I wasn't satisfied with it broke the first month in owning it, it's too flimsy and I was disapointed in this one."
1,This Is A Tab Book For Bass !,"I purchased this item thinking it was a tab book for guitar. When I got it, I found out that it was for bass guitar. I'm mad because Amazon didn't state that it was a tab book for bass plus paid $30 for it. I'm not buying anything from Amazon again."
3,goya,This is a great over view of Goya's collection of war images. It may be too graphic for some people. But this bookis a great addition to one's collection of Goya's art.
5,A must have,This is an excellent book for anyone interested in hiking the hills on the Peninsula. It is very well organized and easy to use. Good for everyone from a casual hiker to serious outdoors enthusiasts.
5,"Great, lots of info","Its a great little book, many of the birds featured in it i've seen in my yard. There's good info about each species."
1,A poor choice when buying a Bird Guide.,"This book looks pretty good at first glance ,and in fact gets good reviews from many.However;,on August 5,2008,I wrote a detailed review on ""Birds of California"" a similar guide in this series,and you will see detailed reasons why I feel it is a poor choice to buy.What I pointed out there,applies to this, as well as others in this series.I would also suggest you read other reviews by reviewers who have also not rated them highly.See also my short review of ""Birds of Arizona dated October 8.2008.Some will be happy with the type of Guide you get in this series;while others will be disappointed;at least these reviews will help you in making your choice."
4,Main hoo na.. a great movie!,Im gugjrati myslef. and my familey is big on movies. when ever we watched it it was outstanding(we went through 10 bowls of popcorn)! im not that much of a army movie person but this one is better than the others the comedy is so funny! this is one of my favorite movies i thing u should buy it
4,Endearing - A Classic Piece of Bollywood,"Once again it is easy to see why Shah Rukh Khan is the big star that he is in Bollywood. This film is a classical work of Bollywood with a little bit of everything. From catchy songs, to comedy, to drama, to cheesy and endearing moments I highly recommend this film to anyone. This would be a great movie to start with if you've never seen a Bollywood film. I especially enjoyed the Matrix effects parodies."
5,I'm so ashamed of myself...,"Usually in-flight entertainment is very underwhelming. But who would have known that Air India (of all airlines) would get it right? I was skeptical when the movie first started. But I got into it. It doesn't take much brain power to follow these types of movies, but if you're watching because you want to have fun, this is a definate must have."
5,The ultimate source for your FAQ,"One of the problems you have to face when you start reading any kind of book on Frontpage 2k is to combine and manage different skills needed to design an acceptable website. Moreover, most books just cover the software and not web page design in general term. When you get tired of all those books it's the time to refresh your mind and find answers to your killing questions with a wonderful tool- Frontpage 2000 Answers is that magic tool. Graphics, webstyle, themes, security, DHTML are just a few of the very helpful chapters. It can be useful for intermediate and advanced designers (not recommened for novice users)."
3,I forgot I had this,"I have so many black romance novels it's a shame. I totally forgot about this one. It's actually kind of silly, but cute at the same time."
3,THE ENDING IS WORTH THE WAIT !!!!!!,THIS BOOK IS GREAT .IT STARTS OUT KIND OF SLOWIT GETS BETTER SO HANG IN THERE.
5,Birds of a Feather,"Kind of odd that there are no reviews for this book unless it left everyone speechless. (Put down the eggs, rotten fruit, rocks, pitchforks, and you put out that torch. I went though my own medical hell, which required 5 years of speech therapy.)Well here I go. When I first read this book a long long long time ago.... I felt ........ ... cheated some how. Where was all the nifty techno whiz bangs. The panic flight 30 parsecs through space. Two species meeting as equals in the final frontier. Not there.Twenty some odd years later, with a little more knowledge and experience under the belt. I can see this book for what it is ....... brilliant!!! Living off the land and by one's wits while establishing contact with another species while still working with the first one. A great read the second time. :-)"
4,Cute Plush Dog,I bought this for my 5 year old and she can't seem to get enough of it. She carries him around everywhere she goes. Good investment.
3,Another stuffed animal,"This is a very well-made stuffed animal - very cute with soft fur. However, my 2-year old daughter thought she needed it for Christmas, but has not played with it since. Now it's just another stuffed animal taking up space."
5,Best of the Best!,"Rod Stewart goes back to ""Every Picture Tells a Story"" with ""Maggie Mae""and just 'sky-rockets' from there ! His music carries *meaning & tells astory ! this is a TOP 10 !"
1,Hey Dudes!,"Hey, didn't you have a girlfriend who liked this guy? Remember driving around, another Sat nite of getting nowhere, hearing this guy, ""Maggie May"", thinking, ""didn't they just play that already?"" Remember beer-soaked carpets, butts and roaches lying around, stoned and drunk and bored? Remember the stories about this guy getting hauled into an ER at four in the morning in New York or LA or someplace, what they pumped out of his stomach?Is is still around? Does somebody still listen to him? Hey, is this the same guy as Joe Cocker?"
3,The Very Best of Rod Stewart,"We are really pleased with the product received, however it was disappointing to find a CD in the parcel rather than the DVD we ordered."
3,A Pop Watcher,"the best way for me to describe ROd Stewart is to say He is Adoptable to change.whatever He has to do to make it He shall&does.His Material is Hit&Miss here but it's His take on a song that either works or doesn't.cuts like ""Tonight's the Night"",""Maggie May"",""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy"" is still Cool.but cuts like ""Some Guys have all the Luck"" are dated&""Forever Young""(Good Sentiment&Video)is to Soft for My taste.but Rod Stewart is a true Pop Watcher&Student He keeps a eye on it all.some things work&some don't."
4,Classic Rod Stewart,"I have been listening to Rod Stewart for years, and this is one of the best C.D.'s I have heard. It is great, I will probably end up getting more Rod Stewart music."
4,"I like it, I like!","Since I had purchased one of Rod Stewart's newest CDs Stardust, which I loved, I found that I did not have a CD of Rod's hits over time. This CD fills that bill. It is great. This is one way to get the best without buying 5 separate CDs. I heartily recommend it."
3,There's another side of Rod the Mod as well,"Well, okay, if that's the Rod Stewart that you prefer. This is a good compilation of his most popular pop and disco stuff, certainly it is. It's got just about everything the casual fan would need.But at least take a look at his late 60's/early 70's-output as well - back when he played the toughest folk-rock ever known to man. ""Handbags And Gladrags"" is a fine compilation of Rod's earliest and finest."
5,Rod is forever young!,"I had no idea who the Rod is until I moved to Canada. Although coming from a different cultural and language background, I found Rod's songs are romantic, inspiring and all his songs are bearing his unique voice. I bought both ""It had to be you"" and ""The very best of Rod Stewart"", however I listen to the later one very often as it collects many top hits of Rod Stewart.Not only do I listen to Rod's song, but also I am deeply impressed by his continuous hardworking to refine his artistic styles while he is about to be 60 years old. I feel that I am greatly encouraged by him whenever I have a difficult time.Rod, just like his song says, is forever young!"
4,Great collection,Everything you like from Rod Stewart and nothing you don't. Makes a great gift. I'm ripping mine and putting it out on the MP3 market so everyone can share in the joy.
2,rod stewart,very disapointing! Slow shipping and than it was not as described. Some of the songs that were listet are not even on this CD. Don't think I will buy again unless it's from a box store and I can look at it and make sure it has the songs I really want. This was not the case with this cd.
2,kinda boring,"living in the back woods of maine, i'm familar with logging, so i thought this show would be good. sorry, but i find it boring to watch them haul load after load of logs up a hill.i really enjoy extreme catch. and ice road truckers. ax men is a bit too slow for me."
1,Piece of crap,"I got the Talking Magic Eight Ball two weeks ago and it is garbage. It is so light if you drop it I'm sure it will break. There is no liquid inside with the die or anything it just spits out phrases when you push a button - sometimes anyway. It is nothing like the original magic eight ball. It says it has eleven phrases but it only repeats four of them over and over again, and considering Family Guy has some of the greatest catch phrases, they picked really dumb ones. Peter has one or two, Chris has one, and the rest are all Stewie. There are no Brian quotes which I thought was disappointing."
5,More than a map it's a vacation assistant!,"Don't neeed a thousand words to describe this beautiful map. Great, wonderful and thanks to the publishers for all the information contained."
4,Fun playset!,"Not sure what the other reviewer is talking about, I put this together in 3 minutes literally! It isn't the sturdiest construction but you can't expect more for under $10."
1,forget it,This cannot be put together. The pieces just won't match up and snap togehter. Save your money.
3,THE STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE,"GREAT REFERENCE WORK. MANY MORE SUCH REFERENCE BOOKS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND UNIVERSITY POST GRADUATE STUDENTS."
1,Bad CD,"Lorie is very annoying in this CD and she doesn't use proper french, but horrid slang. 2 thumbs down!"
4,Good album!,"I bought this album not long time ago and frankly speaking really liked it. Of course, Lorie is not Alizée or Mylène Farmer (my favourite singers), but her songs are very energetic, full of optimism and joy. It is a good album. If you go to the gym, this album would be ideal to listen to while running for example*)"
4,Lorie is a Star,"Ever since we saw her music video in French class, I have been addicted. The music has real feeling and great beats and melodies. I would reccomend this cd to people who like pop. My reccomended song(to listen to first) is ""Pres de Moi.""..."
1,Mauvais,"Please, don't buy that album, it's so bad.That's just poor pop music with very stupid lyrics.The singer doesn't even write her lyrics and she lyp sincs on stage."
4,For incense lovers!!,"I like this perfume simply because it is one of the few"" western"" perfumes that incorporate incense. It is not of-course anything like the arabian oils BUT, it's very GOOD! If you like incense, you will like this by kenzo, it is a rare japanese incense used in a special festival. Very mature and bold, not for the daytime, an evening scent and a little black dress. PERFECT!"
3,Lacking in the pizazz department,"On me Flower Oriental smells very similar to its namesake Kenzo's Flower EDP. I smell violets, vanilla & rose. The only note differences from Flower EDP that I can smell is a sandalwood or smoky incense base.The lasting power is moderate on my skin, about 6 hours. It isn't strong & doesn't have a lot of sillage. It would be best to be worn in an intimate setting as, you'd have to be very close to someone to even smell it at all.This is very nice and nonoffensive, but doesn't have quite the pizazz that I'm looking for. Not as exciting as you'd expect an oriental fragrance to be."
5,Kenzo Flower Oriental,"I REALLY love this perfume. I never leave reviews, but I wanted to give my feedback for this one. It's kind of masculine the way Cannabis Santal by Fresh is. It's spicey but sweet, and feminine. It kind of reminds me of sweet musky incense, and a bit powdery. I want to smell this way all day."
1,Why this book sucks....,"This book is horribly written, poorly constructed, and really fails to argue a cohesive point. It bounces around from anecdote to story, and if anything, proves the use of history, and condemns heritage.I disagree with the author's premise, but he doesn't provide any substance to defend his opinion.If I could rate this book any lower, I would."
4,Goo Product,Very satisfied. No other sellers for vintage outboard parts could be found. This part often goes bad - it is required for proper cooling.
4,A very well written Book,I thought Cocky was a very well written Biography depicting the remarkable actions of England's biggest Drug Baron. References were spot on and the book flowed considerably well.worth a read.
4,Cocky: The Curtis Warren Story,"This book on English crime baron Curtis Cocky Warren is a nice look into European organized crime. Cocky was a major player in importing ecstasy, cocaine, marijuana and heroin into England through his Liverpool base and on England terms he was a John Gotti type figure. He rose from a football hooligan tough to the preeminent drug dealer of the UK. This book is totally from the law enforcement angle though and needs more insight from the criminals themselves to ever out the depiction but still it is a good look and interesting read if you are into true crime reads. Hopefully they will make some documentaries on Cocky or do some articles in Maxim or something so those of us stateside can learn more about this intriguing and fascinating drug lord from the UK."
5,A Wonderful Book for children,"My children loved this book, and my grandchildren love it.Its full of inspiration and insightful healings that all ages can appreciate andlearn from."
5,PRETTY BAD ASS.....,"The first volume in this two volume set is worth it, I have to say. I'm a sucker for underground metal, especially the stuff rom the late seventies, early eighties. I love the sh**ty sound quality, the thrash, the rawness of it all.I just think that its a weird concept for the mix, that being that its original versions of songs covered by METALLICA. So is this considered a METALLICA album? Are they getting money for this? I really hope not. It's not that I don't like METALLICA, I just think that they are bogus money pigs. I hope that the real bands all get royalties for their songs cuz a few of these guys never really made it at all.Anyway, I can recommend this CD, but not number two... that one ain't worth it."
2,fragile,"Lovely to look at, but I would not recommend them...they are FAR TOO FRAGILE the slightest tap, and they chip"
5,Peter Thomas roth,This is a great mask for acne it is also a great once a week mask to clean out your pores. It is also a great product for a spot treatment overnight for pimples.
3,Sub-par,"In my opinion this is not a very successful TTF release; I personally only liked 4 songs (all of them on the first CD): ""Welcome to the Club,"" ""In My Mind,"" ""Daydream,"" and ""The Poem."" For some reason this volume is just too hard and not very enjoyable. Volumes 20 and 21, however, *are* pretty good, as of course are the older ones like 12 and 13."
4,Ian Hunter returns to form!,"From the opening, 'Big Mouth' (with it's clever spoken Hunter intro) throughout, this is the best Ian Hunter solo album since ""You're Never Alone..."" and ranks with this and possibly some of his Mott recordings! Hunter, while in even raspier voice than the past, has all of his lyrical bite and humour displayed in the best of his Mott period. He (unlike Jagger & Co.) has in fact copped to his age and writes songs about where he is now in live with great wit and playfulness. The band is just great, with a rocking mix. I approached this cyncially, but definitely his best release of new songs in over 20 years. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,good read!,"This is a good book, though short. The ending is lightning-paced and action-packed. Green's dialogue is snappy and ultra contemporary. The main character is a kick-ass woman. Yeah.However, the sentence structure, or lack of, bothered me for a while. Green cuts sentences in half and makes the second half a statement in it own right. Incorrectly. All the time. She doesn't need to do this ""in"" thing of the moment actually - as her writing is good and would be even better without the gimmicks.I look forward to reading her next vampire hunter book and recommend this one."
2,Scent was different than previous 5th Avenue purchases,The product had a different scent than the traditional 5th Avenue. I am not satisfied with this product at all.
2,tester tease,"ordered the 5th Avenue 4.2oz EDP Spray instead of what the picture shows I got the tester bottle instead; no fancy cap and has printed on it ""TESTER"". So for Christmas I had to say ""I'm sorry honey I bought you the wrong 5th Avenue and I'm sorry for trying to be CHEAP""! Merry Christmas!"
3,Scent wears away fast,I don't know if this is the real thing but I find that the scent diminishes fast. Maybe I got a bad one but I usually like Elizabeth Ardens perfumes.
3,it just 0.51 oz,I a man My love of my life love this Spray ! it so little to me it look like lip stick .it little just 0.51 oz not much that gave junk awayin the Store like that it just little . But what do I know I a Man .
1,don't be fooled by the title!,"What a rip-off. There is very little info. about design in this book, and what is here is nothing specific. Chapter 1 is an overview of design info., chapter 2 an overview of building architecture info. 7 of the remaining 9 chapters are a gmax tutorial or about using gmax, 1 chapter is a photoshop tutorial, and 1 chapter is about careers in the gaming industry ( I guess the book wasn't thick enough and they needed to add pages ). If you are interested in a book about using gmax, possibly look here, but I don't think it is worth the full price. There are many online gmax resources/tutorials available for free, and other books devoted to gmax if you need a hard copy. If you are looking for detailed case studies of the 'whys' of level DESIGN, look somewhere else."
2,You don't expect any fast paced action from an old,"Cain. He throws water on a naked woman? Because she is showingit all.....I thought his acting was what you would expect, good andrealistic. He need to take anger control management. To bad hewasn't up to more acting. Getting to old and looks like he has a badback. He is a fighter, that is for sure."
2,I expected a little more bang,It wasn't what I expected. I would love to see a good Jewish Gangster Flick but haven't found one yet.
1,Not the Quality I expected,Lots of harmonic overtones and ghost notes. Works fine in reverb circuit but not in phase inverter or beginning gain stages. Too many microphonics!!
2,"Terrible messages, not three year old friendly","I read the reviews but decided to try the book myself. I have two big issues with the book and thus can't recommend it:Sometimes if a book has a word I don't like I change it. I prefer not to skip any words but if I have to I will. This book had Noras sister calling her ""dumb"" several times. It was hard to skip.The parents are busy and keep ignoring Nora. We ALL get busy. It just did not seem like her parents were very engaged with Nora. So Nora acted out, like most preschoolers. I just felt this was the wrong message."
1,Book condones name calling...,"I bought this book, through Amazon, for my daughter because her name is Nora. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before I purchased it. In several places in this book the sister calls Nora ""dumb"". Name calling is not acceptable in any form and sadly I will be putting this book in the trash."
1,uses word dumb,"was excited about this book for my daughter, Nora; but it uses the word ""dumb"" multiple times."
2,Couldn't get past the name calling,"My daughter brought this book home from the school library. I had not read Noisy Nora before, and was really surprised by Nora's sister repeatedly calling her ""dumb"". This is not a book we'll be adding to our collection at home."
2,Not for my kids,"Rosemary Wells' book entitled Felix Feels Better is one of our family's new favorites. I went to the book store seeking out more of her books. I thumbed through this one and thought it looked really cute so I bought it. It wasn't until I got home that I read the phrase, ""Nora!"" said her sister, ""Why are you so dumb?"" repeated several times in the book. Name calling of any kind is not practiced in our house and I was disappointed to find this in the book. This is also not a book that my son's teacher would read in class for the same reason. I will be returning it to the book store. Very disappointing."
1,I am shocked! Shocked!,"I will be a new father in a few days, and my wife had a copy of this book in the baby's room. I could not believe what this book seemed to be condoning: the acting out of an unattended to child. As the nature of Nora's actions escalated, I was fully expecting her to torch the house as a coup de grace.In any case, I will not be reading this to my dear (but impressionable) daughter!"
5,This is a remarkable story.,"As a Noisy Nora myself I feel that this book accurately depicts a middle child's feelings about sharing the attention from her parents. A better story for the afternoon, not nighttime. Children will be able to relate to Nora's feelings."
5,Fondly remembered from childhood,"I borrowed this book from the library so often as a child, that I knew exactly where to find it on the shelf well before I was able to read the cover. Now that I have a daughter of my own, this was one of the first books we added to our collection of children's stories. Not only are the prose and illustrations totally charming, but the book offers several ""teachable moments"" (including opportunities to talk about name-calling, which earned the book a dressing-down by another reviewer). This is a two-generation favorite!"
3,entertaining,"It was a fun read. I thought the plot was interesting and there is always something slightly intriguing about the movie industry. I thought the main character was rather immature for a 15 year old though, but maybe I'm mistaken, lol, but I think I was much more mature than that when I was 15. It was predictable but I still liked it and the main reason I bought it was actually for the research, I wanted to know more about making movies as I want to write something of my own that takes place on the set of a movie. As far as that goes, things are rather unspecific but it helps give you a bit better feel for things.I think it's a good read for anyone under 15 and still interesting if you're older than that.Depending on who you buy it from though, mine came with two big stickers on the cover that left big sticky patches and ripped paper behind."
4,sharing the spotlight with... mom?,"Leigh is sent off to Ireland for the summer to spend the summer with her actress mother, Annika Anderson, where her mother is currently starring in the upcoming film Danny Boy, and where she is expected to have ""mother-daughter bonding time"" while being her mother's personal assistant. Leigh excepts to spend her time there being bored, but Sean, her mother's twenty-one-year-old, and hot, co-star, and her bit part in the movie make the summer a little more interesting. But Annika doesn't want to share the spotlight with her newbie, unexperienced daughter, and tension gets even higher between them. Annika and Leigh have to learn to separate the actor sides of themselves from their roles as mother and daughter. This book, though it emphasizes mother-daughter relationships, is far from cheesy, and teaches good life lessons while still entertaining."
5,I love this book!!,"This book describes the nature of various types of stones and the recommended usage inside and outside the home. I've used this book as a guide to show my local stone dealer what type of stones I'm looking for. And also used it to illustrate the concept of my dream home to my Interior Designer, she understood immediately without us having to go through many rounds of interview to get it right. As a result, my dream home is now almost complete with stones from all over the world, marbles from Spain, Italy, Iran.... granite from Norway and Indonesia... coral stones, tumblestones, slates, and many more.... Wonderful pictures and illustrations, I'd recommend this book to anyone! Suitable for modern Asian homes too!"
3,Alot of images of high end homes,There were alot of images of high end homes. I found it hard to see the designs fit in my starter family home. But beautiful images
3,intersting ideas for tile/stone work for any home,This is a good book to have if you are planning to do tile / stone work at your home/office and need ideas.
5,It's a great watch,I've had this watch for a couple months now and I have to say that I love it. It keeps perfect time (I set to the atomic clock a month ago and it's now running 2 seconds fast). What more could I want?
2,Leaks!,"I've had good luck with most Platypus stuff but the bite valves are not worth the money. They hardly give any flow - unless you bite really hard, AND they leak! I've bought two in the past year and they both leak. I thought I may have abused the first one so I took care to make sure the second was not treated poorly, however it's been less than two weeks and it already leaks!"
4,A little expensive,"I lost the bite valve from my old platypus hydration bladder on a recent mountain bike ride. This valve is exactly like the original and fits well, I hope it doesn't fall off again! I thought it was a bit pricey but I couldn't find one locally so I went with it."
2,Cinderella couldn't fit in this shoe,Great looking shoe. These people are nuts if they think the average person could fit in to their shoes. Why can't they make it easy. Street shoe size for all! Yeah. If a dancer wants a snugger(is that a word?) fit by a size smaller. We will return Cinderella's shoe and get daugther 2 sizes larger than her street shoe and the wide width. The son will go 3 sizes larger than street shoe also in wide width.
2,DISSAPOINTED,"The files comes out very grainy and pixelated even at 80 asa iso its no better than the model I had before, the S7000"
4,Great Camera,"I purchase this camera with the idea of learning the setting of the SLR type cameras. This camera has all the features of a true SLR, but the lens can't be removed. It takes beautiful pictures, and if you want to learn the in's and out of manual controls it allows you. I love this camera and would recommend it to any one who would like to do more then point and shoot."
5,GREAT PICTURES,"THIS IS A GREAT CAMERA. THIS IS MY 2ND DIGITAL CAMERA.EASY TO USE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. LOOK AT A LOT OF OTHER CAMERAS GLAD I CHOSE THIS ONE.ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE LENS COVER WAS MISSING. I CALLED , E-MAILED FUJIFLIMEVERYONE GAVE ME SOMEONE ELSE TO CALL OR TALK TO. NEVER DID GET ANYONE TO HELP ME SO I GAVE UP AND ORDERED ONE FROM A CAMERA SUPPLY PLACE, WILL TAKE 3 WEEKS. I TAKE A LOT OF PICTURES AT HOCKEY GAMES. IT WORKS VERY WELL.orville"
5,Fujifulm Finepix S9100 9MP Digital Camera,This is just what I wanted and it takes fabulous pictures. You don't have to do a lot of adjusting to the pictures after you download them. Highly recommend.
3,Good for what it is,"I had this camera for a couple years and it was good for what it is. It took some great pictures, but it was a lot of work to get those great pictures. It doesn't perform well in low light... unless you have a stationary image where you can turn the ISO down and keep the shutter down for awhile. Anything above 400 ISO is bad and 400 isn't good. This could be a great camera to learn on for someone interested in DSLRs as it has a similar look and feel without having to worry about interchangeable lenses and the cost associated with them."
1,RETURNED IT... LCD/Viewfinder are inadequate,"For non-DSLR goodness, just buy the Sony Alpha or R1 family cameras. I like Fujicons a great bit too, so this unit just offended me. The Fuji 10+ digital point-n-clicks are great values. Do still consider these for small jobs."
2,Not as good as other Finepix cameras,"I have owned a Finepix 2800, 3800,5000,and 7000. I bought this camera thinking it would be a more up to date camera, and more like a DSLR. Unfortunately, I have taken about 500 photos with this camera, and the quality of the photos is not as good as my S7000 that I had to sell to buy this one. In fact every other Fujifilm camera I have takes clearer pics than this one. The pics that I took with this camera are dark, and grainy with noise in all modes. The viewfinder on this camera is almost useless, unless you are close to what you are shooting. However, the manual lense is a nice touch. The auto focus on the otherhand is terrible. The best part of the whole camera is that it has a really nice LCD display. It is very sharp, and can move into several different positions. Sadly, I wish I had my S7000 back. From now on, I think I will consider moving up to a DSLR"
4,Finepix S9100,"With this camera I have nearly all of the features of my SLR film camera with 5 lenses. Additionally, the 9 MP Resolution allows me to crop and enlarge as much as I desire.The short battery life is annoying, but a minor price to pay for having so much capability in a small package."
4,Read Cronica... instead,"This book started off great. It tells you about this town and, if you've read more about Marquez, you realize that some characters are the same from previous novels, which was great, I found myself smiling. It is a great story and it really makes you think. You have to pay attention to what you read to understand what he tells us next, which was also great. And I love how the town has characteristics of ANY town.It kind of put me off that he leaves off when I feel he should've continued."
5,"The Last Two Weeks in the Life of Bolivar, The Liberator","From his leaving Bogota in a misty dawn, the mules, the solitude, the little convoy, with Palacios, his black butler, and his faithful Irish aids de camp. To the San Pedro Alejandrino Estate, venue of his death, and his last letter to Fanny. His recognition in letter to Urdaneta of error in having fought General Santander. It has a valuable Succint Cronology. It has Miranda Lindsay, a novel by itself. Bolivar himself would have cried reading this masterful if sad account of his last days."
1,Not please at all.,I live about 35 miles from the city and have the biggest antenna Rat Shack sells. I get good reception for the most part but a some of the channels are bad and a couple ghosting. I hooked this up after going through all channels one at a time taking notes on each ones quality and my wife and I could not tell a bit of difference with it or without it. It made zero improvement to all channels!
3,TV amplifier,Works O.K. but it is better to invest into a better signal receiver i.e. antena or whathaver you may need.
5,Their Best Work,"PileDriver for me represents the best of their work. Apparently recorded virtually live in the studio in just a few days, this album really contrasts the range of style that Quo are capable of. Rossi's lead guitar is just incredible and when combined with Parfit's vocals you have an awesome combo. Shame they went kinda pop a couple of albums later...."
4,Excellent Gift for NewlyWeds,"I received this as a gift from a friend, and it is an excellent source for cooking. If you want to give a couple a great gift--this is one that qualifies. I cooked out of this book for awhile. Best features of this book are the photos and clear format on white background. A MUST HAVE for every kitchen!"
4,INCUBUS,"Incubus, es lo mejor, lo unico es que me gustaria ver lo que trate porque si se trata de drive me lo compro, GRACIAS amazon, chao"
4,While Dr. Johnson's theology. . .,". . .is definitely different in many ways than my own, this book is worthy of exploration by Christians from all sorts of backgrounds.In this heartwarming autobiography, Dr. Johnson relates his triumph over childhood poverty, racial injustice, and intolerance, while rising to the rank of Warrent Officer in the United States Marine Corps, serving on Gov. Reagan's cabinet in California, and eventually serving high-ranking positions within the Nixon administration. Along the way, are touching portraits of the love he held (and holds) for Jesus and for his family.A wonderful story demonstrating how love can overcome hate even in the face of discrimination and personal tragedy."
1,No problem with the order but did not smell right...,"I did not have any problems with the order or with getting the product in a timely manner. However, after giving it to my brother for Christmas her reported that although it was the right packaging and name the sent was definitely different. I reported this to the company and did not receive a reply."
2,Wood Quilt Hoop,This hoop was priced very reasonably but it is full of splinters.I am going to have to use sandpaper on it to get it smooth enough to use it on my quilt. I would pay more and get a better hoop next time.
5,Creepy but fabulous.,The sort of thing you'd expect Stephen King--or maybe Edward Gorey--to listen to when he's looking for good writing atmosphere.
5,Nick Cave's best CD ever,"I could rant and rave alllll day long. . . but I think it's enough just to say that this CD is the best I've heard, including other musicians of similar style."
5,The voice of God speaking...,"Wild Roses was the song that got me hooked on Nick Cave back in 1995, and Murder Ballads was my first Cave album. After three years of loving this music, I can still say it's unique and very, very inspiring. Musically speaking, Murder Ballads is not the very best Cave has ever done - that glory would probably go for The Carny or the whole Let Love In album - but the stories, man, the stories! They make killing seem very fascinating business indeed. I don't think I'm the stuff that serial killers are made of, but this album helps to understand some things human beings have always done and will always do. Even the cover picture is perfect in its silent threat. And I agree with the person who recommended getting the Wild Roses single. The Ballad of Robert Moore and Betty Coltrane is maybe even better than any of these songs, the story is absolutely mind blowing!"
2,"Good, Bad, Bad, Bad, Good, Bad","This is the first Nick Cave album I have ever listened to, so I can't compare it to his other work and I didn't know what to expect. The first two songs on this album are really, really good. I was delighted that this album could perhaps be a new favorite. Then, tracks 3-8 hit me with the fetid sound of boring, familiar music. Really horrible. The female voices (Kylie Minogue and PJ Harvey, among possible others) were all out of place and annoying. The songs were predictable and had choruses that repeated about 12 times too many. After somehow staying awake through tracks 3-8, track 9 brought back the feeling of the first two. Track 10 is better than 3-8, but still nothing too great. The good songs on this album are interesting stories with dark and appropriate music. While I really do like tracks 1, 2, and 9, the album is far from an ""enjoyable album experience,"" which is what I usually look for in music. Skip it."
1,Weak Nick Cave.,Kylie Minogue is God-awful. Would have been better off teaming up with Celine Dion for a Stevie and Edie tribute album.
4,"Scary as hell, and that's good!","My first Murder Ballads experience was the song ""The Curse of Millhaven"". Immediately I fell in love with it, and I had to have the CD. I realized that several of the other songs, too, are very good. ""Stagger Lee"" is a very sinister tune with a killer groove to back it up. ""Where the Wild Roses Grow"", even though it's Kylie Minogue, is a beautiful song. Nah, on second thought, Kylie doesn't bother me that much. The album, although very creepy, has a couple setbacks. I was having a testy day once, and I just happened to be listening to this. I was driving, it was raining, and I was cut off. The music actually made me angrier. So, don't listen to it when you're ready to kill, it will give you ideas. Plus, the album kind of moves slow. It is good, but it takes so long."
4,Simple and Effective,"If you are wondering what they mean by ""clip case,"" they are talking about it having a clip like one you would find on a cell phone holster that you could hook onto a pocket. I ordered this item without being sure if they meant that or if it had some kind of loop that I could clip things onto (like a caribiner).The case itself is fine, and my eXplorist 300 fits perfectly inside it. The padding is thin, but there is some. The clip on it is strong plastic attached to the case securely. You can still hook this onto a belt as the clip is quite large (about 2.5 inches long). For $9, if you're looking for a case, this one isn't bad, and I think it is more versatile than the belt loop case that Magellan offers."
1,"I'd rather wax my bikini area, than recommend this crap !!!","This was the worst book I have ever read. I wasvery suprised, because Joyce C. Oates writesin a way that is very crisp, but I think she musthave gone through some crisis in her life to comeup with this crap. Thank God this book was not that expensive, I would have more upset. Read at your own risk !!!!"
4,A Simple & brief Commentary,To Understand the Christian Faith we must understand the Gospel. Why did Jesus die and for Whom. J.C.Ryle provides an excellent commentary which is brief and very easy to read whether by yourself or in the company of others. In his commentary on John he gives his notes for almost all the words in the Gospel
5,beautiful,More gems from Mr. Ryle... His humble and learned approach is very helpful. He gives you a very practical and functioning perspective of the gospels. You can tell he was a man that walked with the Lord. It is not a cold doctrinal statement that leaves you with nothing but a bunch of head knowledge. He splits meat from the bone. Get it while you can!!!
4,He's lucky it's about Johnny,"The only reason this gets fours stars instead of one or two is it has pictures of Johnny. First of all, the photo they picked for the cover makes Johnny look like he's on crack. The first time I picked it up, I found an error. The book has a print from the movie The Brave, and the caption says it's from Don Juan. If it was really an intimate look at Johnny, I would think it would tell the relationship between Don Juan and The Brave -- and Marlon Brando. It sometimes has its timeline off, also. I'm not fond of prints from movies unless they're really crisp. These are not."
2,What happend?,"Look Who's Talking Too is a pretty bad sequel to the hit film, Look Who's Talking. Kirstie Alley, John Travolta, and Olympia Dukakis reprise their roles and jeez I wish they would've said no to this project. There are few good moments but my gosh the new baby voice is Roseanne Barr and after 10 minutes you won't be able to stand her annoying and monotone voice, like nails on a chalkboard. Do me a favor and stick to the original, and forget about checking out Look Who's Talking Now."
1,"At least there's not one where the animals talk. Oh, wait...","The first LOOK WHO'S TALKING movie wasn't much of a movie. It was a one-joke premise stretched to ninety minutes. It was only occasionally funny.But yet, we have a sequel. Mikey (voiced by Bruce Willis) now has a baby sister, Julie (voice by Roseanne). Same jokes, kids. Only with potty training thrown into the mix.Some inspired casting using Mel Brooks as the voice of Mr. Toilet Man and Gilbert Gottfried as a kids' gym instructor, but it's still a pitiful film.The worst part is that there's a third one."
1,The first one is the best!,"This sequel was really dumb it was much like the first one except now Mikey has a sister, and it also shows a scene where Mikey is talking to a toilet that talks. I can't beleive I wasted my money to go see this crummy movie in the theater when it came out along time ago. It had a bad plot and terrible acting. Whatever you do don't see the third one it's terrible, stick with the first one."
2,IT GROWS ON YOU,THE FRIST time i saw this movie i hated it. however i saw it again. it still not that great but i own a copy. its good to watch ewhen i feel sick or am stuck in the house for some other reason. however the other two movies are much better.
5,Great family movie. Very funny.,This is a very funny movie and perfect for families. Both kids and parents will enjoy it!
3,part 2,"good, good movie/// the past returns on another installment of the look who's talking, again franchise... i loved it"
1,Another one of the worst sequels ever made.,"Along with ""Problem Child 2"", ""Look Who's Talking Too"" is one of the worst sequels ever made. In a series of films, it's usually the second movie that is the worst. This one tops the original film in terms of bathroom humor and bad acting. These two ingredients are EVERYWHERE in this film! Both Kirstey Alley and John Travolta are terrible in their fighting scenes. Add in two of the most obnoxious comedians on the planet [Roseanne Barr and Gilbert Gottfried] to the mix, and you have got one big stinker of a movie."
3,It's those cheeks,"I haven't seen this movie in years but got a double pack of this one and ""Look Who's Talking."" Between the two, Mollie and James (Kirstie Alley and John Travolta) were more interesting as a couple (before all the usual complaints about being parents came into play) in the first one. However, I did enjoy the sibling rivalry/love between Mikey and Julie in the sequel, but really Julie stole this whole movie. That little girl (there were girls playing her but I'm talking about the one who cried about the penguin and laughed at her mother doing the duck hand movement) was absolutely adorable. Those little fat cheeks made me want to hug her through the screen. She was very cute, and considering I have always been a big fan of Roseanne's comedy, this was an easy win for me. Cute baby. Great comic. I couldn't get into the grown-ups though. The brother moving in. The parents. Bleh. Not interested. The kids though? Yeah, I liked them."
4,"Not as good as the first, but still makes you laugh",Watched these series with my older kids when we found out we were expecting. Great laughs for the whole family!
3,Not a bad read,"From the back cover:Cash McQueen was a hard man, a man who believed in the land and nothing else. With the land, a man knew where he stood. It was different with a woman. There wasn't one alive who could be trusted-and Mariah MacKenzie was no exception.The minute she showed up at the Rocking M Ranch with not much more than the clothes on her back and a map of a long-lost gold mine, Cash knew she was trouble. Yet he couldn't seem to stop wanting her brand of trouble. But nothing would ever again make him place his trust in a woman-not even a woman he wanted as badly as Mariah MacKenzie."
5,Wonderful!,"This story promises to be a classic. Everything that makes a good story: adventure, conflict, mystery, and love is in this book. Cash believes he has no reason to trust or care about any female--with the exception of his sister. Then, he meets Mariah, the sister of his best friend and all his theories go out the window. Of course, he does his best to fight off his feelings, but it's of no use. He's caught. However, he goes down fighting, kicking, and screaming. Mariah loses heart when he doubts that the baby she carries is his and decides to make him believe her. The attempt almost kills her but also allows Cash to realize his true feelings. It's a two-hanky book. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful."
4,It was a wonderful book,I had a wonderful 30 minutes reading this book. It was a wonderful book that was easy reading and had me not wanting to put it down. I have yet to read a book by elizabeth lowell that I haven't liked. Try the amber beach series it is good as well.
1,Skip this one!,"This video contains inappropriate content - visuals of women reclining in bikinis as a ""humorous"" attempt to get the audiences attention. The entire video is simply an excuse to use gimmicky and distracting special effects. There is very little actual safety information here.Can I give this a zero star rating?"
4,nice book,"My 9 year old grandson read this book. He said it was kind of weird, but that he really liked it. It has very nice illustrations."
4,Better Then I Expected,"This was definitely better then i expected it to be. His first CD ""O"" was pretty good, though I found that i enjoy this one much better. The odd thing about that is that ""O"" has more songs that i like, but ""21"" still has my favor. I guess its that maturity that supposedly comes with age, and therefore is reflected in the music. I'll keep this straight to the point:[Top 5 tracks]Ice BoxMade For TVBeen With A StarJust Cant Let You GoWhat Are We Doing[Honorable Mention]Do It, Do ItObviously, people's tastes will vary, so you may like some of the stuff that i thought was skipable, but overall this was a decent CD, and if your a big R&B; fan, you may find yourself bumpin this one more often then you think."
3,Good but could have been better,"I am one of many huge Omarion fans and the album was alright, like when I heard it the only thing that made the album were the first two hit songs ""Entourage and Icebox"". They were already hits but, other than that, I didn't see any of the other songs becoming hits. Maybe, ""What are We Doing, Just That Sexy, or Been With A Star."" But, I think with some of the other songs on the album it seems like it was another ""Touch"" song. Like ""Electric, Obsession, Just Can't Let You Go,Beg For It,and Do it"" those were the ones that reminded me of ""Touch"". His first album was better. I think he would have been better off doing slow songs."
2,A sophmore slump for the semi-talented singer,"On his sophmore release Omarion proves he doesn't have what it takes to be a force in R&B. After two huge singles Entourage & the massive Ice Box, I expected a better alum which I didn't get. Omarion is a singer who needs strong production because he really lacks strong vocals. To his credit though that Omarion had truly surpassed his status as the former member of a boy band with his first release with this CD he's just another singer with a hit single."
1,Completely disappointed,After hearing Ice Box I was very excited to hear the rest of the album. This album was supposed to be somewhat dark and haunting. Exactly what Ice Box contains. A dark and haunting melody. The rest of the album is completely trash. So if you read this. You're best buying the single for Ice Box.
1,disappointed,"um.......okay, i don't find Omarion's voice and style of music very ""different"". it sounds just like any other artist in this same genre. This album is very disappointing. I don't like it at all. The only song that doesn't suck that much is probably ""Icebox"". But that's pretty much it!"
2,"OK,Could be better","A few good songs on the album but lets face it,a few just isnt enough.Omarion does seem to change alot from his first album and maybe theres alittle improovement but the album just isn't the best.But anyway,thats just my opinion.All of theese reviews are just that--Opinions.Maybe you'll like the album.But I didn't."
1,a After school special Usher,"first&foremost I dug ""Entourage"" that was the kind of Dance Jam fit really well for a Stylist Singer who while short on Vocals at least has a Groove to roll off of. but the Problem with Omarion is that more often than Not He is just a voice to a Happening Producer or Production. he leaves no idenity with his takes on songs. ""ice Box"" the cut He does with Timberland shows this point of Him just being a voice on a track as to Him leading it. this is Suppose to His ""Control"" Type of Break out album but it sounds like His first album&pretty much throwaway B2k cuts. He doesn't have the Chops to pull a Solo career,but he has a enough ""Usher-lite"" Qualitys to get over until the Next wanna-Be comes along. if he had a half way decent voice then he might have a little something to match some of the hype he gets.the material is alright,but it's a more of the time type of thing than anything you are gonna remember say 3 months down the line."
4,more 2 offer this time,"As much as i enjoyed O's first CD. 21 is definetely more grown up and mature than his previous effort. At first i wasn't really into ""Entourage"" but the more i listened to it. The more i got a feel and enjoyed the song more. It has like a 80's vibe to it hard to explain but i'm feeling it. Also love these tracks below in no order:Ice Box (just that good)Made For TV (nicely done slow jam)Just Can't Let You Go (the beat won't let you go)Midnight (one of favs on the cd overall,vocals and everything just bring it together)Just That Sexy (i just enjoy this one)Do It (again a nice beat and vocals)What Are We Doing (a nice closer)to a cd that brings much more to the table in the way of a more grownup feel to it. Also with Omarion writing songs 1,2,3,7,8,10,11 and 12. He's bringing it with more input to the songs he's singing and its very evident. Looking forward to what Omarion brings to the table on his next cd but for the time being 21 will do very well for me."
3,very off-the-wall michael jackson inspired,"I love the songs entourage and icebox along with several others. Omarian is also a great performer onstage with obvious mj influences in his singing and dancing, but as a whole album, I can't listen to it though I will say that some of it contains of strong songwriting material and you can hear the off the wall inspiration in it."
4,21 shows he's grown,"Fresh to Death. Much better than the first because he is more experienced at what he does now. I love the song Midnight, my fav by far, this is an album where you can actually listen to ALL the songs without skipping tracks! Its good that O is going for a new sound. Thats what growth and maturity in this industry is all about. I love ice box, I don't know where he came from with that because it was a superb effort, I guess Timbaland had a lot to do with it. I love the dancing, I love the beats and the album cover ain't too bad.So, my top 5 from his album:1. Midnight2. Ice Box3. The Truth4. Been with a Star5. What are we Doing"
5,Magical,"Absolutely wonderful and well written, a style I have not seen since writers like ""Cooper"". A transforming story full of life and passion. The author has the ability to take you deep into the story and paints a vivid landscape in one's mind. A MUST READ!!!!!"
3,Not very warm,"Sometimes when I go to bed I become really afraid of the cold sheets. When you first jump into bed the ply sheets feel cold and takes a while to start adjusting to your body heat, so don't expect this product to keep heat very well."
4,Nice Sheets-Great Value,"These sheets are *very* comfy. They wash easily and the fitted sheet has roomy pockets that accomodate our oversized mattress perfectly. The blue color is very soft and could easily suit any decor.I only gave them 4 stars because the fitted sheet has about 6"" of missing elastic. Granted, if you're paying $14.99 for king sized sheets you are getting a fantastic value...but if they are ""seconds"" I think it should be noted in the product detail as well as a description of what the manufacturing error *could* be.I would still purchase them again."
4,Good Deal for the price!,Sheet set is gud for the price! The flat sheet seems of a better quality than the fitted sheet. Its a pretty deep fitted sheet. Flat Sheet also is bigger compared to other I had bought earlier. But as unlike described here the actual sheet set cover read 60% Pima and 40% cotton!!! I don't know if its the print mistake??!!I have bought 3... its a good deal for $14.99!
3,"Careful, NOT 100% cotton","I made the mistake of buying these thinking these are 100% cotton. These don't feel soft at all. I have washed them and they didn't get any better. One thing though, with washing they didn't wrinkle and shrink. I won't recommend unless they are selling under $20."
1,Why a non-Chinese shouldn't write Chinese horoscope books,"So my g/f decided to be cute and sent me this book. so I got it check it out and it's full of the same old BS. Then I looked at the cover, something doesn't look right. Look closer on the edge w/ the picture of each animal. Dragon, snake, horse, goat, so far so good. I keep looking, monkey, rooster, cat... WAIT A MINUTE!!!! CAT?? KITTY CAT??? since when there's a year of the CAT?So yeah, Mr. Somerville, please stick to the common English novels. Thank you very much."
4,Like pc-medical school,"This book shows you clearly how a computer works and how you can get into it to make changes, updates and repairs. I was happy to learn that I actually know a lot! But the stuff I didn't know what there. I was able to fix two older computer (seniors) by following this book. I was able to easily move a hard disk drive, so now I have extra memory on my current computer and can recycle an older one."
4,Good info,Easy to follow. Could use more diagrams or photos. The book is written with language that is easy to understand. Useful glossary and index at the back.
3,fix your own pc,"Fix Your Own PC. 563 pg. book by Cory Sandler.I'm sure I woild have got a lot more out of if the disc wasn't broken when I got it. I'm still looking for some information that would come close to answering a few questions i have. Too bad, I thought it was going to help dig me out of holes."
2,PC Repair book,"Lots of useless information, got absolutely nothing worthwhile out of this book. Maybe it was just to basic for my needs. Not recommended."
1,A collage of clichés!,"What an horrible album! It's not an original creation, it's simply a collage of cliches. A little bit of Azymuth here, a lot of Crusaders there, a lot of Steely Dan elsewhere. This man has no creativity at all. C'mon, give me a break. All tracks sound dated and stereotyped. This man needs to go back home and find his own musical identity and develop it. Urgently!"
3,"Fun, but certainly not Lovecraft","There has never been a good movie made of a Lovecraft story. Let me say that again. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A GOOD MOVIE MADE OF A LOVECRAFT STORY. Having said that, this combination is probably the most watchable of movies made from Lovecraft except for ""Resurrected"". ""Die Monster Die"" is based on ""The Colour Out Of Space"" and the changes are huge and basically unforgivable. Only Karloff's presence makes it fun. As for ""Dunwich Horror"", well, it stars Sandra Dee. That should tell you something. If you absolutely have to see movies based on Lovecraft, these two are far better than the horrible ""Unnameable"" series, but not by a whole lot. Yes, I have them. I'm just not sure that I'm proud of that fact."
3,"so nearly a classic, yet so far","a wonderful credits sequence showing the hooded figures known in the film as 'the old ones' preparing to enter our dimension heralds an atmospheric, psychadelic rosemaries baby/ninth gate esque tale...great score and colours as well as some good actors... but, but, but... ghastly ending, why don't we get to see the old ones?? why does Ed Begley spouting a bit of mumbo jumbo save the day? why don't we get to see the old ones so marvelously hinted at in the beginning? And finally, why don't we get to see the old ones?? could have been so much better, but is entertaining, smooth and colourful as it is (if as daft as most of its genre) and much better than its reputationThrid best of these midnight movies after 'It!' and 'theatre of Blood'"
3,Not as good as I remember,Dunwch Horror. The quality of print was not great. This movie is one of the best Lovecraft story adaptations.Die Monster Die is classic Karloff.
2,Not a great horror flick,"I am a big fan of HP Lovecraft and classic horror movies. I thought this movie was stupid even as a kid and hasn't gotten any better with age. None of the HP Lovecraft movies have really been accurate or even any good and this one is one of the worst. Stupid plot, bad acting, I don't know why they even bothered to call it The Dunwich Horror. That being said, this would be actually a good candidate for a modern remake. I usually hate remakes but there ought to be a decent attempt to make this story into a movie since the first attempt was so botched."
5,"Great mood, setting, actors and story.","This is what vintage gothic horror is all about. A bit of psychedelia mixed in with the doom. Cool old houses, library, outdoor altars above a crashing sea, mythical beasts from beyond this realm. Good stuff. And all filmed in that semi-grainy, Starsky & Hutch / Incredible Hulk looking film stock / video."
5,Die Monster Die/The Dunwich Horror,"A Good double feature and it arrived in time and in great shape, like all Amazon purchases."
2,"Opening credits were the best part, unfortunately","Creepy, moody thriller is not bad, but loses points due to a closing sequence wildly open to various interpretations. Just who lived, died, or was shunted off to another dimension, anyway? As with all MGM's ""Midnite Movies"" entries, it was fun checking out this lesser-known genre flick from years past, but I'm afraid that ""Pit and the Pendulum"" and ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" remain the lone undisputed greats that the label has thus far put forth for our enjoyment. Okay, ""Theatre of Blood"" wasn't that bad, either."
1,Tthe Dunwich Horror,Couldn't play this in my region - Australia - Sadly I had to throw it in the bin - an oldie but a goodie
3,Loosely Based on Lovecraft's Work!,"I think before seeing this film I recommend that you read H.P Lovecraft's the Dunwich Horror first just to see all the inconsistencies of the film. This film had a few style points except the psychodelic vision prospectives. Definitely a sixties film. The acting was terrible and unintentionally funny. It's a wonder why MST3K missed this film. There are some obvious points where you can royally rip this film a new one. As it stands it's okay. But there are instances where this film could've been geniunely creepy, yeah perhaps if Lynch directed it. Rent and for goodness sakes read the actual story."
1,Horrid,"Aside from perhaps a cheap thrill of seeing the cute Sandra Dee this movie is simply an abysmal joke, the acting, the story, the script, the soundtrack, the entire concept and realization of this movie is pathetic. I bought this out of curiosity and recall seeing it on TV years ago, it is simply horrible."
1,buy the book,saw this movie in the early 70's on tv when i was a kid. i recently bought it in big lots for $2.99. i watched it. mmmm-hmm. this version of the classic lovecraft story is about frightening as a roll of damp paper towels. please go buy the book.
2,Another dissappointing Lovecraft adaptation.,"This film is taken from one of HP Lovecrafts better stories, but here its been turned into typical early 70s AIP schlock. The acting is decent, and the film generally looks good considering its low budget. The film is actually more loyal to the original story than most Lovecraft adaptions, though there have been signifigant changes. New characters have been added, others dropped, and the storyline has been altered and simplified. Few of the changes do much good, most are negative.The film moves very slowly towards it's conclusion, as the story is a bit thin for a feature length film. Once Wilbur and Sandra Dee get together in the first twenty minutes, the film plods along until it's time for the climactic ending. Much of the runtime is filled with a lot of 60's psychedelic effects, long dull conversations and occult mumbo jumbo.For diehard Lovecraft or AIP fans only."
3,Is Prince Iaukea Really In His Fifties?,"For a slow afternoon, this isn't bad - consider: Dean Stockwell doing the most amazing eye riffs outside of gay softcore. Lloyd Bochner, once again blowing a chance to become the American Christopher Lee. Talia Coppola Shire, two years before the Godfather - a complete fox. !!!Actual Sandra Dee nudity!!! (Not the second time she crawls up on the slab, the first. Don't blink.) And work through the credits at imdb - they CLAIM the guard who gets a spear through the lower tract from Dean Stockwell in the museum is Prince Iaukea! I'm dubious - that'd make the Prince in his early fifties now, but let's go along with the gag.Yes, the fx were pure cheese, but, hey, Corman was the executive producer, and this was 1970, folks. EAP and HPL adaptations were usually nothing more than the title and a baked-from-scratch script. I saw it new, and was pleasantly surprised that the Other Twin was NOT just a wind machine and flashing lights."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I am a long time classic horror fan, and H. P. Lovecraft is one of my favorite authors. This film was a bad adaptation of a great story and didn't come close to doing it justice. It is promising at the start but begins to come apart in the middle and disintegrates by the end. Coupled with poor editing and bad acting the result is disappointment."
2,More than two stars is definitely suspending my disbelief!,"This movie is the best adaptation of any of the Lovecraft stories. I am glad that the creators of this movie didn't put Lovecraft's name on it like so many others who try to cash in on one of horror's greatest authors. Of all the crappy Lovecraft movies I've seen The Dunwich Horror is the best, and that is a cyclopean leap for me."
4,A very interesting look back...,"...at the role of women, domestically, politically and sexually from a retrospective of the Good Housekeeping Institute, archive in the UK. Admittedly a look at a very British kind of womanhood, that should not alter it's world wide appeal since it speaks of fast changing women's roles from the 1920's jazz age through the depression years and into the WW2.A stunning and engaging archive."
2,Faulty,After a few weeks of use the right charging bay stopped working. I find this rediculous because it is a xbox brand. I would be skepticil about buying this again.
3,This battery charger is awful,Maybe Im being a bit harsh on the charge unit and the actual problem is with MS worthless battery packs.
5,Great Product!!,Buy it. Plain and simple. Worth every penny. Don't forget to buy the extra battery pack cuz the charger only comes with one.
3,item wont work,"item doesn't work at all, feel sorry about it and learned my lesson.. not a satisfied customer... got it cheap though"
4,LOVE rechargeable batteries!!!,There is nothing I love more than rechargeable batteries for my controllers. Normal batteries don;t last very long and I was spending a fortune replacing them constantly. The rechargeables are totally worth the money.
5,A real time and money saver,I bought this product because i was tired of paying for batteries every other week and the rechargables just don't hold a charge as long. I really like this because i can plug in two and just switch out the others and keep on playing. It charged fully in about 3 hours. It's really handy and convenient. i recommend this to all gamers.
5,Excellent battery kit,The battery charges to full capacity in about 2 hours and lasts for a full days worth of gaming. If you're worried about running one battery down pick up a spare since the charger cradle holds 2 batteries. Leave one charging while the other is in your controller. The battery fits well in both the charger and the XBOX controller.Bottom line: If you're tired of changing AA batteries in your controller then this is the solution.
3,does not last,Had product a little over a year and just quit on me. The charger should last as long as the batteries
2,"Hmmm, updated my review","**ORIGINAL REVIEW - I wish I had purchased this device from the beginning instead of the USB-to-controller charger. This thing charges fast, allows for the simultaneous charging of two batteries and a light indicator lets you know when the batteries are fully charged. Now this may be a plus or a minus depending on who you talk to, but it plugs in to a wall outlet and not the USB slot on the console. I look at that as a plus as I have many near by wall outlets and like to leave my USB ports open for other possible peripheral. That said, the product comes with the cord, charging station and a spare battery for under $30. It's a great deal.**UPDATE - So after about 1 year of owning this thing and maybe using it two dozen times, it has shorted out. I'd like to lower the rating to 2 stars, simply because Microsoft has produced yet another shoddy product in my eyes. Yet another waste of money on my part."
5,Throw your old batteries away,"I had my doubts about this unit, but after going through $30 worth of batteries during my children's vacation time, I thought, why not? The amount of money you will spend initially will be offset by the amount of money you will save not having to buy any additional AA batteries.The Quick Charge kit charges up to two batteries at the same time, and does, in fact, charge more quickly than the Play and Charge Kit. Having one of these available while gaming is smart, as those of you who have had a battery die while playing will certainly see the benefit.I would suggest buying at least one to two extra rechargeable batteries. The unit I bought came with one, but like a power tool, having two batteries makes more sense as the second one can be ""ready to go"" in just a few minutes.This unit is worth the money in time and money saved, as well as in convenience."
5,excellent buy!,I definitely liked this better than the corded recharger! Also it charges 2 batteries at once!
4,LJ's review,"Xbox 360 Quick Charge kit works great and saves me a ton of money buying AA batterys for my controller.I can play my 360 all afternoon without a recharge.It keeps going and going and I'm gone to play,Thanks"
3,It's a charger,Bought for my son. Still find batteries missing from my older Olympus digital camera. Buying a bunch of rechargeables may solve this problem.
5,Product still works and is effective,"I have had this product since at least August, 2011 and it is a very useful product I use whenever I game to make sure I can play without having to stop. The distribution center I bought this from was a really useful buy and I would recommend buying this product if you want to enjoy gaming without batteries I would buy this and enough xbox 360 microsoft charge packs."
3,Battery Pack Died,"After about 6 months of use, the battery back died. Wouldn't hold a charge and it just wouldn't work. And when I say 6 months of use, I don't mean everyday use. I would play sparingly, maybe a total of 6 hours a week at most. And I would only charge the battery once it is depleted completely. I was told that is the best way to keep the battery's life long. Either way, the quick charge works nicely. Cant dock stars when it does what its suppose to do, just not as long as it was meant to."
3,Problematic..,"My main complaint with my recharger is the fact that I have to slap the bottom of the unit before it will recognize a battery is in there. Once I do that, it works fine and does the job very quickly(usually in about 2 hours). I don't know how wide-spread this problem is but I felt it should be noted."
3,Works,We bought this charge kit after out last one broke. We had the last one for about a year and a half so major loss. The quick charge kits charge quickly for us so we can get back to gaming. We prefer this over the charge and play kit since this allows us to be wireless all the time and is faster. I do recommend having atleast 3 batteries with this set up so you can always be charging and playing so you never have to interrupt gameplay for a dead battery.
5,"yup, it charges batteries!","I used mine for years and bought this as a present for a friend. Only thing to be careful about is to not leave batteries on it for a LONG period of time. I accidentally left some batteries on it for literally months (we had a baby and I had no time for xbox) and when I started to play again the batteries really don't hold a charge much anymore. Anyway, not the charger's fault. Great product."
3,These things kinda suck,"The left side seems to go out almost immediately and they stop working all together in 6 months. I'm on my third one because I can't imagine how else I would charge my batteries with all the xbox activity in this house. Typical Microsoft crap, but it's all there is"
5,charges fast and looks great,"looks great next to the xbox 360, charges my batteiest fast. have battery packs, but one ov these!"
5,Excellent,"I know everyone says go with the cheaper rechargeable AA batteries. You should buy the rechargeable packs instead because it is durable and is simple. Also, there is no point in making a wireless controller wired(the AA packs make a wireless controller wired). If you have a wireless controller buy this product and keep a wireless controller.I live on a campus where people can play Xbox 360 games on the local network. That means people who have Xbox 360s in their rooms have an average of 3 wireless controllers each. Every single person uses these rechargeable battery packs and there have been no problems at all.Finally, keep in mind that the people who don't approve of this product have all bought the AA packs, not the rechargeable packs. They just don't know what they are missing."
4,"Works well, but fit is iffy","The product works great. It's very easy to just pluck it out of the controller and into the charger, and it holds a charge for a long time. The only problem I have with it is it doesn't seem to fit perfectly into the controller. Sometimes if any pressure is applied which could make the battery shift ever so slightly down or sideways, the nodes lose contact and the controller shuts off. Tech support was no help with this issue either, but I solved it by putting a few layers of tape on the bottom of the battery. Overall a good purchase."
2,Does not work with Nyko (off brand) batteries,"Works great with Xbox brand (i.e., Microsoft) batteries, but does not charge Nyko brand batteries (even though both the charger and batteries are advertised as being compatible with one another). Lame."
3,Beware Only One Battery Pack Included,"I think this is the first review I've ever submitted after years of Amazon.com shopping. I liked almost everything about this product (classified as a game by amazon?) until I went shopping for another Battery Pack. This product supplies you with only 1 battery pack (as advertised) and says additional battery packs sold seperately. Really? I have been looking online and in gamestop stores for a battery pack to buy and use with this charging station and i'm striking out. I've been on the mega online auction site and they are few and far between. I like this product a lot, but would not buy it again if I had to do it over again. It's hard to find an additional battery that goes with this thing. I think I would buy the plug and play kit instead."
2,Get Generic Rechargeable AA's!,"Many have misleadingly reviewed this product as ""essential."" You DO need rechargeable batteries if you're using a wireless controller. You DO NOT need this expensive unit.The 360 Wireless Controller accepts STANDARD AA rechargeable batteries. You are paying a premium for the branding.Also, while this charger is described as ""quick,"" the product description says it takes ""under 2 hours."" Energizer ""quick charge"" batteries charge in under 15 minutes."
5,"xbox360 rocks to the 100th power, great charge kit","I love xbox360 and this charge kit it charges mi batterys full and works great, big saveing on buying batterys, this charge kit is great, and the xbox360 is awsome."
1,Do not get it!,"After reading a lot of reviews with people having problems with this kit, I still purchased it anyway. I have paid for my mistake. Do not purchase this product. It will break within one month."
4,Highly recommend,"I got this charger soon after I got my Xbox 360. Didn't wanna deal w/buying batteries after battery. (Also good for the environment) Very convenient since when I'm not using the 360, I can be charging the rechargeables with this. Also hated the usb charger cable that came w/my 360. Definately recommend this product to 360 owners"
4,Great for game parties,"This will charge up your batteries faster than you would by cable. Sorry, I didn't keep track on how much faster it charged than the cable. I will update this next time I get around to playing long enough to drain the battery in one sitting. I would have given this five stars but when it's finished charging the batteries, the batteries are a lot warmer than I am comfortable with. I know batteries will explode if they get too hot, but this hasn't made any batteries explode yet. This thing is definitely worth the money for the people who has Halo/Madden/CoD/etc parties. If frees up your USB port and you & your buddies aren't tethered so close to the XBOX 360."
5,Easy and less wasteful,This works really well and really fast. I prefer it much more than having to replace batteries constantly.
5,Quick Charge Kit lives up to the name,"The Xbox 360 Quick Charge Kit lives up to its name. I simply plop in my two wireless controller batteries and then plug the Charger into a wall outlet. It takes some time to recharge them, especially if the batteries are depleted, but it so far has no issues or problems. I'm loving this."
3,it was okay,"It was cute, but the only bad thing I would say is that it stained brown after wear and tear...but overall it was okay."
3,CR watterproof Travel Map,"The map is somewhat helpful. However, the map is similar to the roads you find in Costa Rica, not marked. I was hoping for more I guess. It is waterproof but we did not experierence alot of rain. Frankly, I'd go with another map, waterproof or not, and a GPS. GPS worked like a charm."
2,waterproof map of costa rica,The waterproof aspect is certainly superior however the value as a road map leaves lots of room for improvement. Thr driving needs are not well met as roads routes are hard to follow. The directions in Spanish makes it even more difficult. It seems to me that it shoild be available in English at least as a choice and if warranted an added cost.
4,Costa Rica waterproof map,Very nice map. Waterproof I was disappointed that the new toll road from Caldera to San Jose was not shown. This new road was a major reason for my purchase.
2,Not a Road Map,"This map looks very good, and has some good details, but overall, trying to use this to drive on Costa Rica's roads is a BAD IDEA. They get place names wrong, miss towns completely, show interesections where their aren't any and miss crucial ones too. Considering that they don't use street names in Costa Rica, an accurate map is crucial, and this isn't it."
2,Use GPS,"I ordered this item with two day shipping. It didn't arrive until after I left for vacation five days later. Before I returned it, I took a glance at it. It's a decent map. But only a GPS can prepare you for the twists and turns of driving in Costa Rica. I'd recommend that."
4,Could be better could be worse,"I haven't gone to Costa Rica yet to really see how this map holds up. I can tell you from looking at it that it doesn't have quite as much detail as I would have hoped. I printed directions from the internet for some of the destinations we plan to travel to. I think with the printed directions and the map, we'll be just fine. I'd be hesitant to take just the map itself though."
5,very good map,"very detailed and useful waterproof map, it is a pleasure to handle it without fear of breaking it like normal paper maps"
4,good map,"Best map with great info we had. But to get around in Costa Rica we were here 30 days. YOU NEED A GOOD G.P.S.I payed about $300.00 for one in Costa Rica at radio shack,and it will work in the USA to. Buy this MAP and GOOD G.P.S. [....]"
4,Costa Rica Map,"The map is very detailed, and nice. Only problem is, the roads in Costa Rica are not marked well. I was not able to use this map very much, instead I used GPS. To me it is not all thatuseful on the road, so I put 4 start. But as a map this is as good as it can be."
4,Better than Google,"While you can get a lot of the same information from Google, I found it difficult to get context for various cities in the country. Since I am consiering moving there, I needed this to know how long it might take to reach certain services (Hospitals and clinics).There is a minor amount of what appears to be paid for location siting, most of them are fairly halpful.I would have liked to see the location of various farmer's markets."
4,Waterproof map of Costa Rica,It's hard to say how good the map is until I actually go to Costa Rica. It looks very detailed and the waterproof material is really nice. I had expected it to be thicker and harder to fold. Overall it looks like it's going to be a good one.
4,really cool,I ordered this for my brother for a Christmas present. It came on time and has excellant detail. He will use it this summer so I am not sure of the waterproof feature yet
4,I like that map...,"That map contains a lot of informations. Things to do, places to see and many more. I'm back from Jaco on the pacific coast and I can say there is a lot more to see and do that the map doesn't say. I know is't impossible to have all the activies to do in Costa Rica but lets just say there is more than just the map. It's worth it.Cette carte contient beaucoup d'informations. Plusieurs places à aller et voir. Je reviens justement de Jaco sur la cte pacifique et je peux dire qu'il y a plus de choses à voir et faire que ce que la carte dit. Je sais que c'est impossible de savoir tout ce qu'il y a faire au Costa Rica, mais disons qu'il y a plus que les informations de la carte."
3,Decent Map but many other better Costa Rica Maps out there.,Decent map but doesn't show many of the roads further south near Pavonnes unlike many of the other better quality Costa Rica maps out on the market. I would skip this map and get the Waterproof Costa Rica Map by International Travel Maps instead.
5,Fabulous map!,"This map is excellent. We travel in Costa Rica every year and theis map is up to date with all the features and things to see, activities, turtle locations etc."
5,Great map with enough detail to get around,"This map had enough detail for us to track where we are in Costa Rica, as well as detail maps of the areas we visited. With this and a guide book we were doing pretty well at planning where we wanted to go."
5,Great map!,"This map has great detail compared to other Costa Rica maps. Studying it the night before travelling made the navigating easy and allowed for much better enjoyment of the spectacular countyside. It was delivered on time. Another map requested arrived after our vacation was over and was completely lacking in detail, ie- no El Castillo near Areanal Volcano. Route numbers are not marked well in the country, but following the next town signs, with the town names all present on this map, made it much easier. Follow the town signs."
4,Detailed Local Roads,"This map is great compared to other costa rica maps due to its detailed cut outs of specific areas like Monteverde, Arenal, Tamarindo, etc."
3,nice,"Very nice. Basic magnet. I usually buy more expensive, metal or plastic magnets but this one is very attractive. nice"
3,LIGHTWEIGHT SEVENTIES POP,"Smokie were regular visitors to the UK charts in the latter half of the 1970s with their catchy pop tunes. Living Next Door To Alice was their remake of an earlier hit which they took into the top ten, while Oh Carol is a bouncy number which went top 5 in 1978. If You Think You Know How To love Me, I'll Meet You At Midnight and Lay Back In The Arms Of Someone are in the same vein, as is Don't Play Your Rock `n Roll To Me - all these aforementioned were a type of middle of the road pop ballad that did well commercially but haven't stood the test of time very well. Their version of the classic Needles And Pins is just digestible, but their uptempo pop sound has best stood the test of time. This collection also includes Stumblin' In, Chris Norman's duet with Suzi Quattro. Overall this an enjoyable album of lightweight pop with hummable tunes and professional playing, but nothing remarkable or innovative."
3,Nothing special,"Savage was touted as being a little more extreme than the other magazines covering the same topics. Unfortunatley, there is really nothing special here. I also find myself looking for more detail in their coverage. I will get into a story, then turn the page only to be disappointed that the story was concluding without going into details I was expecting (and looking forward) to read. I was looking for a magazine that would go into the history of a technique or style; who were the masters and what about the technique/style inspired them; what did each master do to make it their own; and provide extreme photos from multiple views so the full prospective and meaning can be seen. Savage leaves me wanting more."
1,amazon defult,"On 8-21-2012 I ordered a set of leupold 30mm rings for a sako rifle.What I got was a set of 1"" rings.I sent them back on 9-10-2012 and asked for a refund.It is now 9-30-2012 and I have no refund,and there is no contact phone number on your site. Sence then I bought 30mm rings at brunos shooting supply. Will someone at amazon look in to this and send my money back,thats if anyone at amazon reads these reviews."
5,A Good Series,"This is a great series to have in your collection. Steve McQueen is great as Josh Randall, Bounty Hunter. So many young, up-coming actors/actresses make guest appearances."
3,If it is too good to be true...,"Bought all three seasons from independent vendors on Amazon. Eight episodes from each season are missing - a total of 24. That's the bad news and it's probably my own fault for buying cheap. The good part is the quality of the picture is sharp and clear. Steve McQueen is brilliant, just as I remember. The stories are well written and the acting is great. There's a lot of action, enought to keep you glued to your seat for 26 minutes.I'd give it 5 stars if I didn't feel like I got weasled out of so many episodes. Such is life."
4,Wanted: Dead or Alive - Season 2,"Very good acting and good stories. Too many company introductons that you can't skip over, otherwise good DVD's and good case. Single sided DVD's with label. Harder to smudge or scratch the DVD's."
5,"twice the action, wanted dead or alive","Wanted: Dead or Alive - Season Twowanted dead or alive ! i have been waited 30 years for this and season 1love old time tv western ; it is tv at it's best ,brings you back to a time when it was worth turning on your tv set!i look forward to geting box set season 3 next!"
3,Unclear information...,"I'm sure these are good songs.However, the track listing for this CD single states it's Enjoy The Silence with the B-Side Virtual Environment.The product descriptions says it's the other version with the few live tracks.Which is it?I for one would prefer the one with the B-side.This should be fixed, or better, sold not used, or even better, available for download."
4,A great three-piece rock record,"If anybody knows The Tea Party, one listen to The Interzone Mantras and you'll know the band has actually stripped down it's sound. Instead of delving further into the studio sound they created for TripTych, Interzone showcases a much rawer, hard rock sound that allows the band to showcase it's awesome muscianship. Jeff Martin's guitar playing in particular jumps off the CD with Lullaby's memorable zip being the standout. So if you really have an appreciation for great rock muscianship, you should really check this record out."
4,Return to Rock,"WOW! I am relieved that TTp have released this album. Triptych is a good album. Good album. Interzone Mantras is a GREAT album. This has all the classic Tea Party elements. It fuses eastern instruments with a truly rock sound. It took me 2 spins of this disc for me to fall in love with it. This album along with The Edges of Twilight and Transmission are my favorite Tea Party offerings. If you love great rock music with thought provoking lyrics, then this is the album for you. If you are new, I suggest doing a little research on the band to fully understand their work."
3,2-D,"This album seems to be just a surface (i.e. 2-dimensional). There is no meaning or depth behind most of these songs. I think that the Tea Party are losing something. Still, there are some better songs like Lullaby, Requiem, and Mantra."
4,blah blah blah,"You know when I first bought this cd and took it home I thought it was great, but then after a few more listens I was beginning to bore of the same sound throughout the entire album. Its Middle Eastern themes certainly make the music stand out from anyone else out on the radio right now, which I enjoy particularly. Its nice to see that some bands are carving their own sound out while the rest all sound alike (cue entrance stage right-Sum 41, Blink 182)I don't know if its just me but I find the music itself to be different and overall strong, while the songwriting needs work. Its that or I'm just looking too much into Jeff Martin's songwriting abilities, lacking as they may be.If anything, buy it for the music- its certainly different and is a nice alternative to anything else out right now. Maybe you'll even like the songwriting too, who knows?"
1,BEAUTY WAS ONLY SKIN DEEP!,"I loved the look of this watch, SKA245. The quality of case, bracelet and crown were excellent, and the price was right.The problem I had, was the watch would never hold a charge, regardless of how much I tried the ""start-up procedure"" as indicated in the instructions. (The second-hand keeps skipping every other second, indicating a low charge). Speaking of instructions, my watch came with the manual for another Seiko model, not the Kinetic. What they did include was a photo copy of the instruction sheet tucked into the watch's box.....very strange!The bottom line was, I am returning the watch and don't know if I would ever buy another Seiko Kinetic. Too bad, it was a beautiful looking watch. Not recomended at this time."
5,Great Watch,"Perfect transaction. Watch was of very high quality. I gave the watch to my son for his birthday, he was blown away that I had given him such a nice watch. I feel I got an exceptional deal on this watch."
5,Good watch at a great price.,"I have always liked Seiko watches so when I saw this one at such a great price, I jumped on it. I've had the watch for a month and it works great. It looks like a big watch but is deceptively light compared to my other watches. Overall, I am glad I bought this watch."
3,Seiko Watch,Purchased this watch because we had seen one similar in retail store and it did not require a battery - uses kinetic energy. Watch would stop and go at first but seems to be working o.k. now although it does lose time.
2,Not working well....,"The watch itself is a beautiful piece, but if it's not worn every day it stops working, which I find annoying. They are supposed to hold a battery life after a full charge for at least 3-6 months....I'm about to send it back."
3,A nice watch,"I was very pleased with the basic look of the watch. I have had a couple of instances where, inexplicably, the date failed to roll over. Once, I even noticed that it was off, not by a day, but by about 2 weeks. It was not from lack of noticing either because I look at it every day. Somehow in the space of 24 hours, the date went awry. Other than that, it does keep good time."
4,Seiko Kinetic Watch,"The watch is an excellent buy - well below the list price. Watch is heavy and solid, seems like a high quality device. The colors are perfect to match with my work uniform. The glowing hand/dial are a bit weak but still useable for night time time telling."
5,Excellent Book!,"My fifth-grade class loved this book. We are studying world geography, and our teacher read us this adventure story about Adam Story, a fifth-grader who tries to circle the world in forty days. Every chapter--named after time zones--is exciting. I only wish there was some sort of map in the book that details the kid's journey. I demand a sequel!"
5,World Studies,"We read this book in fifth grade. It's fantastic. While reading it, we did many lessons about time zones, transportation, continents, oceans, and world cities. Not only is this book interesting--about a boy who tries to travel around the world in forty days--but it's exciting and educational. What more could a reader want? We can't wait for the sequel."
5,2009 Nutmeg Award Nominee,"I live in Connecticut and I saw this books was a nominee for the 2009 Nutmeg Award. It's about a 12-year-old boy who is challenged to circled the world in under forty day by taking only land and sea transportation. It's very unusual, very exciting, and one of those books that's easy to read and hard to put down."
2,A disapointment,"The bottom line is this book does not fully prepare you for the SQL Administration exam. I was shocked to be taking the exam and encounter material that I had simply not been introduced to. Beyond this it was written well enough, but its failure to adequately prepare the reader for the exam is a major shortcoming.Used in conjunction with other resources, such as New Riders TestPrep or the Exam Cram book when released, it should be useful."
2,Not to be used as a sole resource.,"I found the book useful as a beginning introduction to SQL admin. However, the questions and exercises did not prepare me for the exam. (Having passed all my Novell tests and the first four MS test the first time,I was surprised not to pass this one the first time, even after much effort.) They were far easier than the actual exam. This might be useful if one were to combine it with the SQL books online as well as another training source."
4,A Great Collection of studio and live,"I love this set. UFO always rock no matter who the guitar slinger is. Schenker obviously blows away them all, but the Chapman era was more melodic and commercial sounding, and made some killer albums in the 80's. The Atomic Tommy is another mid 80's era with the underrated classic Misdemeanor. The Laurence Archer era of UFO is finely represented in this collection. Not only do you get the entire studio album, High Stakes and Dangerous Men album, you get a live collection of 70's era Chapman and 90's era Archer. What would have been nice, and warrant 5 stars for this release, is the inclusion of the entire Lights Out in Tokyo live album featuring Archer. That was you have the whole Archer era properly represented in an inexpensive package. OH well, it's a nice collection, the studio album is solid and so is the latter half of the live album. Enjoy."
3,All glittle are not gold,The item came on time but its shiping and handlling charge is way more which made this expensive than local market.
1,"Repaired Once, Broke Twice. :-(","I really want to support American-made products, and bought a Waring for its simplicity, good looks and it's ""Made in the USA"". Well I spent over a [$$$]to to replace a 7-year old Asian-made blender. To make a long story short, it broke down in 3-months w/ very little use - my wife was adament to make it last as long as possible. We sent the blender to a factory-authorized repair shop (we paid the shipping), and it broke down 3-months later. We bought a [...]chinese made blender for [$$$], and it's still working a year later. I will mail the blender back to Waring and tell them to keep their product."
2,Polanski's least rewarding flick.,"Criterion quality on image and sound. Pity the film does not have the substance to justify this production.Made while in England, after the money making Repulsion and before Hollywood's promise of being a multi-millionnaire called him away from England. If you like Knife in the Water, The Pianist, Rosemary's Baby, Ghost Writer,you probably will be very disappointed with this low budget contrivance."
4,holy mountain,"Cul-De-Sac is a total original offbeat something or other that defies description but remains delightful, charming, gritty, and unpredictable. Roman Polanski must have pulled off a once in a lifetime beatnik, castle on rock mad cap comedy, oft time thriller meets crime, amongst social niceties with the upward noble British sans 1966. its a completely nuts film but aims askew and hits the mark. Criterion has now released Polanski's first three films and each is unique and diverse that their unusual and uniqueness is their common thread. this is way beyond art house with a witty cast, script, and location of a lifetime. do not miss this one if yourriver of cinematic auteurs runs deep, south of normal, black and white, with accents that sound a bit fowl."
3,A bisexual man who wants his marriage to work,"I appreciated the author's willingess to squarely face the daunting issues that confront the spouses of bisexual and gay men. Statistically there are twice as many bisexual men as gay men. Many of us deeply love our wives and want to stay married and partners with them. I believe unbiased research will show that there is the same percentage of loving committed bisexual men as there are hetereosexual. Unfortunately, this author provides very little practical help and almost no hope for the bisexual husband and his wife. She suggests that the wife will have to make the biggest adjustment in the relationship. This paints the wife as victim and not as a potentially powerful partner in transforming a relationship. A bisexual marriage can work with the loving, courageous committment of both partners. Its not for the faint hearted, but then what about about life is."
5,THis book was a Godsend,"When I discovered my husband was gay over 10 years ago, it was difficult to find any information on this subject. I was so confused and blindsided. I found this book online and it really helped me understand what I was dealing with........it appeased my questions and also helped me understand what my then husband was going through. One of the best books out there about this situation. Thank you."
2,Not so informational,"The book was quite long on examples, and then had a tendancy to refer back to examples by name and expects you to remember the details. I was looking for answers to ""Why?"" and to ""Okay now what do I do?"" and found that this book did not help.A chapter later in the book discussed affects on kids, and I found this insightful."
1,Doom for married bisexuals,"I came out to my husband five years before he read this book. He didn't believe I was bisexual, but the more often I tried to talk to him about the issue, the further he would shut down. Eventually, he read this book and decided that our marriage was doomed, despite that we had been together for close to twelve years at the time. Our marriage would have been possible to salvage if he'd not read this, bought the propaganda that being married to a bisexual was a disaster, and actually attempted to communicate about the issues both of us were having.If you're bi and your spouse reads this, expect to be served divorce papers."
2,Less-than Helpful for Bisexuals,"I was excited when I saw the title of this book. Foryears I had been disappointed to see that the mass medianever seemed to take into account that a person who iscoming out in a marriage could be bisexual.I hoped this book would be different, but it was not.If there was a reference to bisexuality in this book,I could not find it. I certainly hope that someonecan prove me wrong. The message I read, however, was""wives, don't event attempt to save your marraige. Itis over, there is no way your husband will ever beinterested in you.""This book leaves absolutely no possibility that a manmight actually love and sexually desire his wife, butstill struggle with being attracted to other men.I have heard others who have reported having the samereaction to reading this book - it lacks a true bisexualperspective. I would look forward to another book byMs. Pierce Buxton on this subject that allows for thepossibility that the person coming out might be bisexual."
2,Offers no hope,"This book is so negative. The main message is that the marriage is doomed and that the straight spouse has to suffer while a dysfunctional bi/gay partner makes up his/her mind about where he wants to go. It also offers all sorts of solutions involving sex arrangements with spouses and gay partners - an anathema to most straight spouses. The book convinced me that I must leave my straight wife, because there was no way I could save my marriage. I went as far as putting our house up for sale and making financial arrangements. Then I realized the book was wrong. Over the years I had lost my ability to think with my heart. I had become depressed and used gay sex for comfort. I am trying to save my marriage, no thanks to the book. The book is useful to those couples who maybe didn't have real love there in the first place."
1,I'm disappointed,"As a friend, I know that Jennifer left a LOT out of her book. Like, the fact that their marriage broke up before her husband came out of the closet. She never mentions the Mormon Church, yet they were very active in it; her husband decided to leave the Church, and that was when they separated. While they were separated, they BOTH started dating. Then, her ex admitted that he was dating a man.I'm very disappointed, Jenni, in a book that calls itself ""brutally honest"". What else did you leave out?!!!"
3,You Never Know When You Need Two Of the Same Movie,"I gave it three stars because I actually wanted ""The House Of Exorcism"" after seeing it at the old World Theater in Hollywood back in the day. I guess this also came out as ""LIsa and the Devil"" as well. They decided to give us both versions of the same movie, but with a different title. It was cheap enough, and I love this ridiculous movie."
2,No clue why I own this movie,"My purchase of this movie was like an impulse buy of chewing gum at the grocery store. The major difference between this movie and gum; There's a brief moment where I enjoy the chewing gum.I first watched ""Lisa and the Devil"" and it was your typical B Movie from the 70's. I then watched ""The House of Exorcism"", which is pretty much ""Lisa and the Devil"", with deleted scenes thrown in to make it a tale of exorcism as a post-thought. If you're looking for a thriller that somehow missed MST3K's radar, you're in the right place. I'm giving this movie two-stars, because watching Telly Savalas offer a grown woman a lollipop is one of the creepiest things to come out of the 70's (aside from Pasolini)."
4,Great for those interested in genealogy and scrapbooking.,"As someone who does both genealogy and scrapbooking this book is full of ideas. The ideas given in this book are both simple but yet elegant at times, something that I like.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is into genealogy and wishes to preserve and show off their family photos, stories and heritage."
2,"Drab lay-outs, but good basic info","I'm creating a Heritage album (a long and loving process) and bought several books and mags including this one. BKB provides much sound info re: researching familyinfo and buying basic supplies, but her lay-outs are soooooo boring and depressing - just uninspired! Neither do I like the oddly popular ""10,000 themes"" lay-outs!! -- too many embellishments and the photo and story get lost, but BKB's examples would never make you want to review her album a second time. She also doesn't deal w/the challenges posed by being a 1st or 2nd generation American and not being able to easily access foregin family records, and how to lay-out pages when you don't have photos (note - do more creative journaling).Instead I would recommend special issues of Memory Makers (e.g., Sept 2003 ""Heritage scrapbook ideas,"" Memory Makers ""Creating Heritage Scrapbooks,"" and some issues (read before you buy!) of Legacy magazine."
2,Disappointment,"I was disappointed by this book. I had hoped to find ideas for page layouts and designs, but instead found only repetitive, unimaginative pages. While it did what it said it would do in terms of covering the basics of heritage scrapbooking, it also perpetuated the misconception that heritage pages are boring."
1,Waste of money.,"Buy a pad of paper for $1 and save the money. Basically, it is blank pages to journal when reading the 5 Love Languauges book and or group study."
3,Strange book,"I expected it to be a treatise on physical theories uncovering the very nature of the world, but what I got were essays on some more and less famous physicists, interesting but not bringing any new information. The most curious thing came somewhere in between: one chapter descibes how Aspen citizens tried to solve the problem of contaminated soil that some neigborhoods were built on. There are commisions, federal experts and one society member digging the case. Maybe thas is interesting but confusing as well, as unexpected in a book of this title. All in all I have very mixed feelings about it."
5,Great buy!,You can't beat this price. This holder works great. You must remove your phone before answering it. Make sure you put the phone in with the camera facing the clip. I put it in backwards at first. The phone won't stay in that way.
1,Not happy,"I ordered the Care Bear Cubs Giggles and Wiggles bedtime bear to replace one my 5 year old son has had since he was a baby. It used to talk and move and it had got broken, so I wanted to replace it. I received a similar care bear that glows but it is not what I ordered, my son was disappointed, but we kept it anyway. Oh and by the way I was willing to pay $40 to replace his favorite toy, but was not worth it for a regular care bear.=("
4,Excellent advice for African big game hunters,"This book exceeded my expectations from reading the advertizing. The author provides detailed advice, with sound reasons, on calibers and bullets apropriate to hunting big game in Africa. He does it in a very readable style in a concisely written book. He covers the subject well and with an appropriate mix of theory and practicle information. His advice is based on extensive experience of his own and of other respected professional hunters. I have read many articles by, and talked to a fair number of, professional hunters and people who have hunted Africa over the last 15 years and cannot recommend another source where one will find all this information available in one place, much less so well organized and easily understood."
3,Flawed menu...,"My DVD has a flaw in the menu system. From the main menu, I select PLAY MOVIE but the screen goes blank and nothing happens. After my third attempt, just before I was about to call Amazon for a return, I finally played with some of the scene selection buttons and finally the movie started up. Could be just my DVD or could be all of them. I didn't read any other reviews so I'm not sure. I just got the impression that this movie wasn't professionally transferred to DVD. The quality wasn't anything special but I wasn't expecting much from a 25 year old cartoon. Once I figured it out, I enjoyed the movie."
5,The right treatment for a classic film. The picture quality is amazing.,"This is a bizarre movie, but a cult classic for its insane storyline and striking visuals. You've probably already seen this movie if you are considering buying this bluray, but it has NEVER looked nearly this good. I've seen this on VHS and DVD, and thank god we finally get the proper aspect ratio as it was projected originally. There are some imperfection, dust and the like on the print, but honestly a good job was done cleaning this up considering this came out in 1984. The sound is a bit shakier, but that is simply a fact of having a film this old with no surround mix to be had. If you liked this movie before, you are going to love it on bluray. They didn't just throw this thing out, they put some work into doing it right."
5,The BEST G.I. JOE MOVIE!!!!,"FINALLY!!! To have this movie in hi-def and full screen is wonderful!!! Looks great, and brings back great memories featuring all of our favorite joe characters!! YO JOE!!!!"
5,Pure Awesomeness!!!,"Cobra, LaLaLaLaLaLaLaLa!!!PQ:5 1080pSQ:2 2.0 DolbyThe movie itself is as awesome as I remember. Picture quality is superb for animation this old. The sound department is lacking considering we only get a 2.0 Dolby track. This is probably due to the source material. Overall it's a must-have blu if you spent countless hours, like me, reliving GI.Joe battles in your backyard. Yo! Joe!"
3,Overblown video of the 80's cartoon series!,This video is about the Joes and their battle with the terrorist oraganization Cobra. The video puts too much time on the new Joes and Cobras.The only thing I actually like the title sequence at the Statue of Liberty in New Your City! For fans of Cobra the oraganization's history is revealed as well the secret of Cobra Commander! Watch this video if your a fan of the series from the 1980's and want go back to your youth! also does anyone know when this coming out on DVD?
4,Can't ask for much more,"Glad to see this movie is on DVD and in fullscreen!! The GI Joe Movie is pretty good and will be enjoyed by anyone who was a fan of the show as a kid. Very nostalgic. The disc includes many of the ""knowing is half the battle"" shorts, associated with the show. The movie was good and the DVD adds to that with good features and giving us what we all want.. the movie! I only hope they have ""The Return of cobra commander"" and ""the making of sirpentor"" out on DVD as well."
4,good but not great,"This movie was good, but i was disappointed. that whole cobra la thing just ruined the movie. they could've done much better. i think they just got extremely lazy with the movie. this movie is probably what sealed the fate of G.I. Joe. I felt really bad for cobra commander. i mean, REALLY REALLY bad. It did introduce some new characters but got rid of some old ones. so i give it 3 out of 5."
1,Doesn't work.,"DVD was really scratched up when we received it and after trying to play it in two different players, it didn't work."
3,G.I. Joe: The Movie,"I know it was an 80's children's cartoons I decided to buy this DVD is my attempts to ""recapture my childhood"" and I wasn't disappointed! The movie itself was okay but the DVD extras are what make this a ""must-keep"" for me. It this particular movie, the Joes try to stop Cobra from deeolving the world through these organic spores. In this movie the true ancient origins of Cobra(la) are FINALLY revealed.The movie marked a landmark in GI Joe storylines. Most the old-time favorite Joes and Cobras appeared. Many new characters also made their debut (Lt. Falcon, the Renegades, Nemesis Enforcer, etc). However, the movie itself may NOT be the best feature of this DVD. The exclusive DVD features are. This movie may be the begining and the end of the era or cartoon. You can be the judge of this."
3,Lights! Camera! Cobra!,"An enjoyable movie, with an interesting orgin of Cobra. Finally, we sort of get a glimpse of what Cobra Commander looked like under his hood. I felt sorry for the Commander when he was turned into a snake. I wished there were more extras, such as a short look behind the scenes. Got to love those PSAs! ""And knowing is half the battle!"" I find it highly amusing that Burgess Meredith (who voiced Golobulus), also starred in the 1945 live action movie called ""The Story of G.I. Joe""! Is that an odd coincedence? I eagerly wait the release of the rest of the G.I. Joe series. The scene from ""Arise, Serpenter, Arise"", where Cobra Commander cheers on Sargent Slaughter during Slaughter's fight with Serpenter is downright hilliarious! ""Come on, Slaughter, kick his fangs in!"" The movie had some great animation, and the voice work was fantastic! Cobra! Yo Joe!"
2,Geez! I didn't know the human body held that much blood!,"""'A-Team' style action where nobody gets hurt?"" Indeed not! That was true enough of the cartoon series, but how come nobody mentioned the near-death scene of Duke? (A scene which looked like it was going to be an actual death, but somebody changed their mind--look how it's animated and think about it. Duke was supposed to die!) And for gosh sakes, the blood! There was more blood coming out of that stab wound than is humanly possible! I am not kidding here! Those who have seen it know! Another character is stabbed in the eye in a later scene (though without the blood--they used all the plasma on Duke's stabbing, apparently). The ""family oriented"" nature of the film was betrayed by these scenes."
1,Total Trash,"What a piece of garbage. This ""movie"" takes everything we know about Joe and Cobra and flips it upside down. It also introduces us to some of the lamest new heroes and villians ever introduced in the G.I. Joe universe."
5,A classic in every way.,"This film encompasses the era of Joe which I was most familiar. The 80's Joe, a different kind of real American hero. The story itself is good, if not a little far fetched at times. The voice acting is right on with Don Johnson and Burgess Merideth. The Joe history takes some interesting plot turns with the inclusion of the Cobra-La; overall though it's well directed and action packed. Yo Joe!"
5,It's GI JOE!,"This classic is full of cliche, and bad dialog, and good wholesome fun for boys. I bought this for my boys, wanting to relive a bit of my childhood with them. Good times! Back in the day when it was still good to be American, and we were encouraged to be proud of who we were."
4,Memories...,This is a great cartoon. It brings back memories for me as a younger kid. I enjoy watching today. Plus I left my kids watch it they enjoy it as well. G.I.Joe is something I grew up on and I still collect stuff today.
2,Lack of Snake Eyes kill this movie,"Also unlike the Transformers movie, it doesnt play like a movie, it just has the same score from the Tv series and kinda plays like one long episode."
4,G.I. Joe The Movie,I think the movie was good. I did not like the way they turned Cobra Commander into a snake however. I wasn't fair to blame one person for all of Cobra's failures.
3,GI JOE the movie,"I am a huge GI JOE fan, but I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews when they said the cobra la thing was rediculous. To find out the cobra commander was some mutant from the past was just plain stupid. I did not care for any of the new characters that were introduced in the movie. The movie should have focused on the more popular classic characters like storm shadow, snake eyes, fire fly, ect.. Overall, I would have to reccoment the movie just because I am such a huge GI JOE fan. Also because the more GI JOE stuff we buy, the better chance we have of more classic JOE stuff being released. Support the team YO JOE!!!"
3,Disapointing,"This movie does indeed take the GI Joe off on a disapointing tangent. It goes away from the military/terrorism aspects and into more of a mystical feel. That's not what GI Joe was about and it pretty much killed the series. The only groundbreaking part of this movie was someone actually getting hurt and bleeding real blood. Much better are the episodes about the DNA cloning that made Serpentor, showing the series was indeed ahead of its time."
5,What's Your Fee? Snakes Don't Work For Free.,"This movie is synonymous with excellence to anyone who was a fan of the cartoon and toy. If you never liked it, you just won't get Cobra Commander's incessant whining, the odd sexual tension between Falcon and Jynx, the wisecrackings of Tunnel Rat, the megalomaniacal ravings of Serpentor, the patriotic 'tude of Sergeant Slaughter, and the classic melodious ramblings of Roadblock. This movie really is about the underlying battle of good vs. evil, pertinent more today because of the terrorist threats that abound in our own world. The score is amazing, and the plot is actually quite complex. (I mean, the writers of this movie predicted the oncoming threat of mass biological/chemical warfare, the importance of satellites in today's information age, and the first real proponents against cloning DNA (Serpentor anyone?)) I recommend this movie strongly. It was light years ahead of its time."
5,Finally On DVD!,"Finally, G.I. Joe The Movie comes to DVD. Finally I can retire my original '80s VHS copy. What can you say about this movie? From top to bottom it's superb, from the opening sequence which still gives me chills to this day, to the spores ""burning in orbit"". The DVD version adds even more. From the wonderful animated menus and chapter selection screens, to 25 of those original ""Knowing Is Half The Battle"" public service announcements from the show that you KNOW you loved, to '60s and '70s G.I. Joe toy commercials, and more. A wonderful DVD and a wonderful movie."
5,Awesome Movie,"G.I.Joe: The Movie was the second best movie ever made (second to Transformers). Everything about it was awesome. It had cool characters, cool scenes, cool music, and a great plot. It should've been released in the theaters. The only disappointment was that Firefly wasn't in the movie. Firefly was the most awesome Cobra character."
4,Another priceless piece of 80's nostalgia.,"Those who can well recall their endless youthful fascination with G. I. Joe, much as I can, will find much to remember from those good old days of 80's animation in this movie. G.I. Joe was great action oriented entertainment with some patriotic flair for good measure... no doubt, the best part though was the awesome battle scenes, fascinating machines, and cool heroes to cheer and evil bad guys to jeer. This movie captures it all! My only complaint is that, unlike the Transformers movie, G.I. Joe didn't take this opportunity to better adapt itself for the big screen. The new characters seem to be only filling in or supplementing where the old ones left off without the added drama of having to deal with the PERMANENT departure of the old heroes. There's no real 'punch' or sense of transition from generation to generation. Nevertheless, this is still one hell of a movie, so I give it high marks for effort and pulling off a pretty exciting story to match."
5,Awesome isn't a good enough word for this movie,This movie rocks for the beginnning to the end. You have to buy and see this movie. It is full of suprises and best of all Cobra gets it stuck to them again. I would love to tell you more but that would ruin it.
5,The Awesomest movie ever,The G.I. Joe movie is quite sweet. I love it and I watch it all of the time.
2,"An okay flix, but not worthy of past Joe cartoons.","G.I. Joe: The Movie wasn't as good as the other Joe cartoons that I remembered watching. G.I. Joe was at its best before they got into all that stuff about Serpentor and Cobra-La. While this movie does bring back old memories of playing with the Hasbro toys, the plot is somewhat lacking. I would much rather have seen no-name actors as the voices of the characters. Don Johnson--come on!!! Burgess Meredith was cool, but the movie seems to rely on big name talent instead of a good script."
1,G.I. Joe the Movie,Never received this movie from the seller. Had to wait a month to see if I ever did get it. Now I'm in the process of waiting two more weeks to get my money back. The seller refused to contact me after I requested she do so. Amazon told me to wait longer. Not happy with either the seller or Amazon since it was Amazon that named this seller for me to purchase the movie from.
1,Disc does not work,"I use a PS3 as blu-ray/dvd player. Selecting anything from the main menu causes the PS3 to crash. Eventually, I ended up ripping the dvd and streaming the video file from my pc.oh yeah, and the movie itself is terrible. They should have stopped at season 1."
4,Great comprehensive coverage of a new science.,"This book was my textbook for an Organizational Psychology class I took as a junior in college. I am now a graduate student of organizational psychology. This book recognizes the importance of research and theory, as well as practical application. It is easy to read and well written. Some of the things I learned in reading Organizational Psychology are still well with me today, almost three years after reading it."
2,Yes these are filter guards but not as pictured!,I ordered these based on the photo. I needed two filter guards to match one that I already had with the spiral design on the outside. The guards that cyberguys sent were 60mm and fine filter guards but they had a different grill design. This might be okay for some but not for my use.
3,Looks nice,"I was a bit disappointed by this. I thought that, although it looks superb and is no doubt a festival of continuity for long-standing comic fans, it over-egged the pudding to such a degree that the little things - a gripping story, characters that you can care about - are pushed into the background. It's like a series of stunning oil paintings one after the other with a tenuous story that seems a bit like 'Batman : The Dark Knight Returns'. It seems to have uniformly five-star reviews here, but I haven't read it again since I bought it, and that was some time ago."
5,Great read,Alex Rosses' use of a photorealistic technique makes the illustrations look wonderful. Add to this a good storyline and you have a great read. One of the best graphic novels I've read. I would highly recommend.
5,Great!,"This graphic novel is, quite simply, one of the best I've ever read and undoubtedly one of the best ever made. Stunning artwork and a gripping story truly make this graphic novel a must read. I could try to explain the story, but I would be doing an injustice to the great depth of Kingdom Come. Buy it if you're a fan of anything DC, and especially if you're a fan of Alex Ross and I guarantee you will not be disappointed with your decision."
5,Phenominal,"One of the top ten best graphic novels ever produced, right behind The Dark Knight Returns"
1,format issues,1st off this is a very good if not great graphic novel. It is the kindle format that is faulty. I downloaded a sample. All they did is just copy the pages. While this might work for regular books (although people with seeing problems might not agree) it doesn't for graphic novels. Since there is no zoom facility you can't focus in on the panels or smaller text. Some of the text in the 1st part of this book are so small you cannot read it. It also doesn't have the panel by panel format as I have seen used in some graphic novels. Kindle needs to use the same format as Graphicly or the one included on the Kindle Fire (I haven't used it so I can't really confirm this) for all graphic novels as well as comics. Until then it is better to get a hard copy. This is also true of any book with pages of maps or graphs. A really good example is the format used for the Economist. It has both a zoom feature and a optional article feature. I hope the publishers pay attention.
5,Worth the read!,This is a rather good product. The detail of the painting on each panel can def still be viewed on the kindle. Also the smart panel choices are really clever.
5,Awesome graphic novel,"I'm not a comic book reader per se, but I enjoyed this one. It was recommended by a co-worker and I'm glad I read it. I love the artwork and the dramatic story."
2,Kingdom Boredom,"I have to say that the only thing I like about this book is the cool green cover. This book is really boring and kind of hard to follow. I bought this book because a lot of the reviews say it's great, but it is not. A lot of them say the art is great, but it is horrible, never seen a superman graphic novel look like this, reminds me of the art from the book ""The Polar Express"" when I was a little kid. I wouldn't recommend buying this, save your money and check it out at the library and see how bad it is yourself."
5,"""KINGDOM COME"" one, come all!","I am an avid comic collector. I collect comics the way I buy books, and I found out, by accident, that amazon.com also has graphic novels. It's on now! I purchased KINGDOM COME on year ago, and, until I get my hands on others, it will be on my list as one of the most important comics on the market and should be read by all collectors. This is a story of what happens when too many people receives super powers, but not the responsibility that comes with it. Action packed with a superb storyline, characterization that went above and beyond the call of duty, and off the hook artwork, this book should be branded with 10 stars!"
4,A common misconception...,"...seems to be that Kingdom Come was the brainchild of Mark Waid when, in fact, it's Alex Ross's baby. In fact, Mark Waid was hired as scripter only after James Robinson declined. The basic plot was his and all the new characters seen were conceived and designed by him. Of course, this is completely understandable since the credits do not even list Alex Ross as co-plotter and list Mark Waid first, for reasons I can't fathom. Anyway, just thought I'd try and clear up this misconception.Oh, about the book, I agree that it's a visually stunning piece of work that's perhaps a notch above Ross's previous major work, Marvels, but I can't say I'm the biggest fan of the story."
5,I chose to read this than watch the Superbowl...,"I bought this a few years ago on Superbowl Sunday and read it cover to cover rather than watching the big game. This book is simply beautiful. The art is what gets people on this book. Painted by Alex Ross, each page (not just covers like in alot of comics). The story is great and the ending is priceless. My brother would envy Superman for what he got to do."
5,The best comic book that I've ever read.,"An excellent story, amazing drawings and an interesting treatment to a story about what the life of the aged super-heroes could be like. I recommend it, it's a must read."
1,Doesn't work on the kindle,"Don't be fooled by the title (Kindle Edition). It doesn't work on the regular Kindle- nor would it open in Kindle for PC. I'm sure it's a good comic, but wouldn't know as I can't read it. Hopefully Amazon will rectify this problem soon."
2,"All Plot, No Characters","Maybe I'm the wrong audience for this book. I consider myself not a fan of comics, after all, but a fan of literature in whatever form it presents itself. Watchmen? Dark Knight Returns? Both brilliant stories, drawn with style, and told in a way that welcomes both the fanboy and the neophyte. Kingdom Come, however? Blech. Though its artwork is fantastic, beyond all reproach, its story boils down ultimately to a superhero name-dropper's wet dream, a procession of DC cameos and self-references. I felt like an idiot every time a Darkseid got mentioned, a Spectre got revealed, a John Constantine fluttered by without an explanation. This book might be heaven for the Comic Book Guy on the Simpsons. To the casual reader, though, Norman McKay seems to be merely preaching to the choir."
4,"Actually, 3-3/4 Stars...","But, for some reason, they don't let you do that.Reviews of this collection appear in large part to be very favorable, or very un-favorable. I'm in the middle. The hight parts are the excellent art, dark tone, good dialog, and maturity. These traits alone set this collection in the upper-eschelon of graphic story. However, Kingdom Come is still no Watchmen, no Dark Knight Returns. There is far too little backstory, especially with regard to the metahumans. They are the antagonist, yet the reader is furnished with almost no info on their mindset, or their history. Beyond that, the story is painfully difficult to follow at times, and will demand a second reading. Now that's not always a bad thing, especially in books that are packed with detail. Kingdom Come, however, is not as much packed with detail as it is just hard to follow.All complaints aside, this is a very good collection. But it could have been great..."
2,Meh...,"I can't quite place why I didn't enjoy this story. Graphically, it was great but something about it just didn't make it a classic for me. If you're looking for a good read to pass the time, I'd say look elsewhere."
4,Some Good Stuff Man,"As a Christian, I just don't relish in the fact that they used the book of Revelation for a basis for this story. I mean it's a great story and all. But they did not need that to make it a good one. I guess it pressed a nerve or two, and for that it loses a star. That aside,absolutely everything else is top-star, two-thumbs up quality. Not to mention it is one HUGE graphic novel.Alex Ross is the man. I repeat THE MAN. His art is fantastic. Definately pick it up. Maybe not a must have, but just for the art alone I think it is worth it. Once again, they really didn't need Revelation for this novel, but everything else makes it definately worth it. Batman as always is great. Superman...well, is Superman as always. The love triangle with him and Wonder Woman Played real well and...e'hem...the baby. Nuff said. Pick it up."
5,ONE OF THE BEST COMIC BOOKS OUT THERE!,"You're DEFINITELY not a comic fan if you don't read this. And you're really a stupid loser if you think comic books are still kid stuff after reading this. And you're an abomination of society if you want to try and censor this cool book. So start reading this now. Look, there's a whole bunch of hidden in-jokes (there's a panel with a hero modeled after the ""Star Wars"" character Boba Fett, There's small cameos of Spider-Man and Captain America, and for those who like 60's music, The Beatles and the Monkees make an appearance as super-heroes. Oh, and did you know Elvis read comic books too? He liked the character Captain Marvel Jr. and had that jumpsuit of his modeled after Marvel Jr. {As some people say}. So Alex Ross {He's the artist of tis book} made the older version of Captain Marvel Jr. look like Elvis, and I think called him ""King Marvel"" or something.) SO YOU BETTER GO READ THIS REALLY COOL BOOK NOW!!!!"
5,"Simply, WOW!","This is a unique trip through the DC universe. The device of seeing the ultimate war of the meta-humans through the eyes of a human preacher steeped in the apocalyptic visions of the Bible was masterful. As both a preacher and a comic book fan, this graphic novel really hit home for me. The artwork was phenomenal. stirring and beautiful. The presentation of the moral dilemmas faced by our legendary heroes was epic. There is nothing about this story that I didn't like. BUY IT! READ IT! THINK ABOUT IT! READ IT AGAIN!"
5,incredible story and artwork,"I love Alex Ross' artwork. It is the reason I decided to read this book. The story is incredible, with the grand battle of ideals as well as heroes. A lot of reviews of this book say you need to be real familiar with the DC universe, but I disagree. While I had seen a few tv shows and cartoons, I never read any comics. I knew only a basic idea of the major characters and their powers, and the story was perfectly clear to me. I think what the people who say you need to know the characters well to understand this book see is that there seems to be a lot of inside details that you will appreciate if you know the DC world well, but they are mostly not crucial to appreciating the book."
3,Fantastic art but...,"Alex Ross is the reason you should read this once - just to experience his artistic gift. However, I really disliked the story and what they did to some of my favorite characters. I don't want to spoil anything, but I found myself annoyed with how the story progressed and just about everything that Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman said or did. The premise is interesting, and with a strong recommendation from a friend and Alex Ross as the visual talent, I thought this would be a truly incredible work. If you are into collecting comics as artbooks, this is some of the best DC universe art you've ever seen and you might want to pick it up for that reason. Otherwise just borrow it from the local library or friendly neighborhood Ross fan."
2,Bedford handbook,"I bought this thinking it was the 7th edition bedford handbook, not the accompanying book of excersises... The book was okay, but notwhat I needed."
5,THE Book on Leadership in Learning,"I have designed educational material for five years now, and SATFOL reminded me why I got into the field in the first place. It has also made me realize that I have been beaten down by clients over the years, and now am just spitting out whatever they say, and yet at the same time am losing business.Mr. Aldrich has reminded me to lead. He has also given me the specifics to lead effectively. I am enjoying talking to perspectives for the first time in years. I care about what my shop is producing again. That is why I gave the book five stars.I should probably mention that my brother who teaches computer game design is also contemplating using this as the primary textbook in his class."
5,read it before you take decisions!,Aldrich knows what he is talking about and it reads like a novel. Before you know it you have read most of it and you can reproduce it because of the catchy examples and arguments.Gave me food for thought while designing e-learning for prisoners and stops me going down the tracks the market wants you to follow.Ernst Duvert
2,Not enough information for elearning developers,"Although I found the story of Aldrich's work on Virtual Leader interesting, I didn't need convincing on the power of simulations coming into this book. As an elearning developer, I wanted general information on the art of creating simulations. After reading the introduction, I thought that I would get this general information interspersed with examples from the development of Virtual Leader. What followed was the story Aldrich's development experience, leaving the creation of additional simulations as an exercise for the reader. As much of the book was dedicated to leadership content that would find its way into Virtual Leader as was dedicated to information on simulations. Not what I was looking for."
2,T2 - 'Second Bite' (SPM),"From what I can tell, this looks to be an early '90's reunion CD - with a new drummer - Mike Foster. Sad to discover this comeback effort isn't that good. It is noted somewhere that 'Second Bite' is supposed to be the UK progressive trio's never-released title to their self-titled and 'It'll All Work Out in Boomland' albums (see my reviews of both). Nonetheless, there are several re-workings of previously released songs like ""Questions And Answers"", ""Careful Sam"" and ""Mistrel"" along with some unreleased material. For completists only."
5,must have,"i bought this for my first son. he loved it! especially when he was able to work the pages for himself. my second son has had trouble with words and verbal communication. this is one of the few books that he will insist that i read to him, right now."
5,Fabulous Fabulous Fabulous Messages!,"I have watched many Abraham-Hicks DVDs and they have all evolved me in ways I never dreamed. This random selection on my part has several well grounded perspectives on dreams, negative experiences in childhood, anger, etc. Ester Hicks has obviously matured her relationship with, and ability to verbalize the messages she receives from Abraham, the collection of entities she represents. It is as always, mind-expanding, which is the only reason to watch anyway."
5,It was wonderfully written...,"It's about where the entire world falls victim to a disease, But in the beginning, there were biodomes that were experiments that housed 10 people. But there were survivors that were immune to this disease but the people in the biodomes weren't. They were protected, They sent one man out to see if the disease had passed and unfortunately, he caught it. I only read this one because I still can't find the ""Beyond Eden"" book."
1,Buy from the original,"I found out that the product you buy here (great by the way) is without the clip board and comes with old batteries. It was impossible to get service from this dealer. In the company's site there are also extra refills, pens and batteries and the service was great."
1,you can have a better deal,"this product arrived with empty batteries, no refils.my friend bought it from the original web site and he got an extra clip board for free."
3,Nice but 1 issue,"I've used this mic for 2 interviews. The sound is excellent, very rich & full. The only issue I have is the handling noise. If you move even the cable a little you can hear it....not super loud, but you can hear it. Your talent must be very still and you must route the cable in a way that it is secured to the clothing somehow to avoid the noise. The sound of the mic is well worth the low price, but be warned, you need to secure it well."
2,Too annoying to finish,"The girl playing Spork was great, but the other actors, especially the one playing her neighbor, were so annoying and awful that I could not even bring myself to finish watching the film. And what was with the fake sky over the trailers? Everything here seemed forced and too clever for its own good."
1,Didn't see any difference,"I have noticable undereye cirlces and bought this product in the hopes it you lighten them a bit. I use this product in the mornings and evenings for several weeks. Nothing changed. I figured maybe it would take more then a few weeks to notice anything so I continued to use this product (use the entire jar, just to give it plenty of time), still not difference could be seen. For me it was a waste of money."
5,Already noticed a big difference!,"The product is a small amount of smooth gel with little 'beads' inside. For my dark circles, mostly due to chronically rubbing my eyes due to allergies and genetics, this product made a difference in a short time (about two weeks, applying twice a day with a cleansing and moisturizing routine). We all have dark circles for different reasons and this was the first product to make such an impressive impact for my case. My eye area feels soft and smooth after application, but I did notice a bit of tingling when I put it on as stated in another review. For people that rub their eyes due to allergies I can recommend this product- it is really worth the cost."
1,Waste of money,I am half way thru this eye cream and haven't noticed any difference. My cream was grey as well- as the previous reviewer stated maybe it isn't a legitimate product because this did absolutely nothing for my eyes!
5,Great Product. Skin Under My Eyes Much Prettier,"I have been using this product for over a year. Only took a couple of weeks to improve the very thin skin under my eyes. A little goes a long, long way. One jar lasted me about 4 months using every day. This product blends into the skin quickly and I use it under make-up. It calms my skin. I am happy about this product."
1,It didn't work for me,"I usually love peter thomas roth products, but this one was a definite let down. This product tickled my interest because it contains Kojic acid, which is supposed to target discoloration, and vitamin k, which should target bruising and hence should minimize bluish dark circles. However, after using a whole jar I saw no difference. I wouldn't recommend."
1,Didn't work -- refund not available,"Product did not work for me and seller did not allow me to return it. Considering the amount I paid for this eye cream ($56), I am not happy."
2,Stings my eyes,"i love PTR products, but this cream stings my eyes, and I cannot apply concealer over it. Try PTR unwrikle eye instead."

3,Instructions for bigger projects please,"I learned about this book by watching an episode of ""Simply Quilts"". I've gotten a lot more out of rewatching that episode than I got out of the book. There are certainly beautiful pictures of completed projects, but they all tend to be for wall hanging, not for practical use. I'm in the beginning stages of making a king size diamond bed quilt and the book lacks in instructions for how to best put together such a large quilt. Yes, I can infer from the graphics in the book how to do it, but just a paragraph or two on how an expert in this design would do it would be very helpful. This will only be my 4th or so quilt and the others were smaller and simpler designs. When I looked this book to review it, I see there's now a diamond quilt book for beginners by the same author."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"The book has pretty pictures, but nothing spectacular. It seemed to be a book of beautiful pictures instead of instructions. I wasn't really interested in the source of the color schemes as I was the instructions. If you want a pretty picture book of quilts and the actual pictures of the inspiration for the color schemes, then by all means buy it. I was disappointed. The public library has equal quality books for free. The book just isn't my cup of tea."
3,Product was sold as used... but from a library...,Outside cover was sticky and inside you can see where the book was from a library... just hope I don't have to pay any late fees.... but arrived in a timely manner... thanks
2,Sesame street bean bag chair disappointment,"the chair does not hold its shape and the filling makes very loud ""crunching"" noises whenever the chair is sat in, moved or needs to be ""fluffed""."
5,Much needed escapism!,"This book is a wonderful way to spend a lazy summer afternoon, or a rainy Saturday. Village Affairs by Miss Read is the second book in her beloved Fairacre series, all about a British schoolmistress and her post-WWII adventures. Folks who think nothing ever happens in a village are dead wrong. No sex, drugs or rock n roll but a delightful cast of characters that will leave you smiling and relaxed. In these perilous times, it's nice to spend a few minutes in a safe, serene world."
3,Not really Wambaugh,"Joseph Wambaugh wrote the book this was based upon and allegedly later sued the company to have his name removed from anything associated with the movie because it wasn't true to his writing. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters and liked it, but I was young then and couldn't wait to be come a cop. Now some 34 years later, watching this was just OK. The film focuses more on what police officers did wrong and how screwed up they were than being society's last line of defense against criminals that they truly are.I'd read Wambaugh's book again.I would not watch this movie again.FWIW."
3,"Cute, but large","I bought this for my mom, thinking it would be a cute little addition to her small front porch... It's very cute, but much larger than I was expecting..."
4,This is an exciting glimpse of the future.,This book shows that the universe CAN be a lot simpler if you think about it logically and forget the old ideas that are full of puzzles - like point particles and big bangs and 10 dimension universes. Then everything fits together. It is also exciting because the new quantum matter waves might be the way that minds communicate silently.
1,ignores latest developments,"The first review by MX Wizard, although harsh, struck a chord and so I checked to see how well the author's web site is coded. These days, it's important to design web sites that can be used by anyone and any kind of browser. The author's site does not do this and does not validate using the w3c validation program. The MX tool includes a validator for ensuring modern best practice - it's one of the main reasons that those of us who need to code for legal compliance upgraded to MX.And as for 'A reader' from Mauldin: 90% of all those using google last month were using some type of windows OS. Are you seriously suggesting that any web site that does not render properly for those 90% is acceptable?"
1,way too superficial,"the most exciting new features of Dreamweaver MX are related to the ability to develop dynamic web sites, rather than static HTML pages with JPGs hanging on them.This book ignores the new features.I recommend you ignore the book."
2,Disappointed Mac User,"I bought this book expecting to be able to find exercises that would help me REALLY learn the product. Boy, was I in for a big surprise. If you're a mac user, FORGET IT! This book assumes you're using a PC. Last I checked, many people who do web design are mac users. When I got to the first screen and saw that what was shown in the book was different than what I had on my computer, I gave up. It may be helpful for PC users, but if you're a mac user consider yourself ignored . . . yet again!"
5,Best blink song ever!!,"out of their entire collection, this single outruns all the other full albums with the mind-blowing song. the live tracks just add to the great song that the band created."
3,"Feels like an episode, not a movie","Having watched the first 3 movies so far, and most of the episodes on Sci-Fi, I can confidently say that this movie would qualify much more readily to be one of the episodes. The quality of the first two is not present in this movie, and plot-wise it could easily be skipped with no noticable discontinuity. If you are a big fan of the tv series, you might be interested in watching this movie, but if you liked the other movies but not the tv series, you can skip this movie without missing anything."
4,Yet another great movie in a series of 4,"In this movie, 3 of 4, The lexx is hungry and lands on a garbage planet to feed. The alive crew decide that Kai is Dead dead not alive dead so leave the Lexx to bury him. They get into trouble with the occupants of the planet and Kai, who was alive dead, saves the day. Not quite as fabulous as the other 3 ( don't get me wrong, it is great but the others are better) but a must none th less."
4,Better than expected,"I'm not in love with this crib, but it's practical, sturdy, goes well with the decor of the nursery, and was a breeze to assemble. Most of the items associated with having a baby were very hard to assemble, this was cake. We love that it grows with the baby, and I'm confident that it will hold up for years to come, it's very stable. I highly recommend this brand of product as most of what we got was Storkcraft, which I think is garbage."
2,Who can make it past the first chapter?,"This is a self-serving justification for exploitation during the worst period of capitalism in history. It's the functional equivalent of Shell Oil claiming to be environmentally conscious. Aldrich forgets that from those to whom much is given, much is expected."
4,A Cornerstone Book on Little-Understood Americans,"The author is to be applauded for presenting an insider's view of established wealth. Almost every book ever written about Old Money is from rank outsiders falling back on third-hand gossip and undocumented cliches (Lucius Beebe was the worst of these.) While Aldrich's frankness about the shaky foundations of his own family are much appreciated, he clouds his authority by being a terrible name-dropper. Rather than strengthen his arguments, these constant references to his ""Social Register"" pals drag the book into near self parody. Also, sadly, nobody can accuse the author of crisp or amusing writing. And beware: much of the book harks back to people and incidents of the 1950s, 1940s -- and back even farther -- making most of the material seem pretty dusty."
1,pricy for costume jewlery in a cheap cardboard box,"not impressed with this. packaging was very cheap, and jewlery looks like something i'd pay five dollars for at wal-mart. save your money. not a good product."
2,Not a Swarovski product.,"This necklace is not what you may expect, after going to some Swarovski stores you can tell it has ""other"" quality, maybe crystals come from Swarovski but the necklace is not similar to original ones, maybe it is a good gift for the price, but be sure what you want before order it."
2,Not worth the money,Looks better in picture then in reality. The crystal looks more like plastic then glass. A cheap trinket. Not sure what is made with Swarovski Element in this one
4,Very Good But Could Have Been Better,"I am a huge fan of franchise modes, and I though this would be my answear to want. The franchise mode is ok. The interface is awful, it is not easy to move around though the game. The free agent signing is not very good it is hard to sought by position, and you have to select every player you want to see the stats of. The draft is ok as well. The interface is bad and you can't scout you players all it gives you is the players potentional. The gameplay is very good. And the franchise mode, despite the some of the flaws is still good. I think I am going to buy WWS2k3 as well to see which one is better. I advise people to wait until the games come up and see if those are better or worse. Overall this is a good buy."
1,"Horrible Gameplay, Horrible Interface, Just Horrible","I saw all the features this game had to offer and thought it had some depth. It does offer a lot as far as features are concerned, unfortunately the interface is designed so clumsily it makes it awkward and just plain boring to do things such as change your minor league roster.The gameplay is by far one of the worst things I've ever witnessed.YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER PITCH OR BAT LOCATION!You choose a pitch, then another option pops up if you want it to be a ball or strike. What is this, 1983? You would think that a game on the PS2 would allow you to control the movement of the pitch.Batting is boring, the batter can't even move around in the batter's box! Hitting a homerun feels the same as hitting a pop up.Fielding is awkward and slow.Bottom line - add all the features you want, the gameplay is just awful."
4,High Heat 2004,Most people who just like playing the actual game and ignore the salary negotiations etc. will find it very similar to 2003. I should have saved my money and just kept playing my 2003 version.
2,low heat baseball,the game is much better over last year but the over all look of the game is still poor the player face look all the same .detail like al is good but the over all look is not what you want from a ps 2 game. go with mvp baseball or all star baseball you will have a better over all good time.
1,Dont buy this game,"Do not, I repeat, do not buy this game. The graphics are horrible, the gameplay is horrible, the only reason it got 1 star from me is the A-AAA minor league system, but that doesnt even have real players. You would think 3DO would be able to add a couple prospects for each team, but no. High Heat 2004 is a bad name for this game, you can't even choose where to throw the ball. You choose a pitch, then you decide whether it will be a ball or strike. The graphics are terrible. The gameplay is normal. Ken Griffey Baseball for Nintendo 64 was better than this. This is the last time I am gonna buy a sports game from 3DO."
2,High Heat 2004,I think this game is the worst baseball game i have ever played. Allstar baseball 2004 blows it out of the water. I am buying World series Baseball 2k3 to see how that compairs to high heat.
1,"GAME DOESNT WORK, NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT","This game will not load on a brand new PS2. The game company (3DO) told me to send my PS2 to Sony for repair or cleaning. It's a month old! My 35 other games all load and play.I did get the game to load once, by propping the game console up at a 45 degree angle. After playing the game, it promptly froze while I was viewing the game stats. It then would not reload!The company agreed to 'check' my disc, if I would send it to them. I am paying the postage and insurance. So far this game has caused me nothing but aggravation! DO NOT BUY IT!!"
2,Not Realistic,"This game is not one bit realistic and really hard to make it through an entire game with out getting bored or annoyed with something that is just silly! The camera angles at times dont follow the play and you will need to catch a fly ball with nothing on the screen! The load times are ridiculous and through out the game your PS2 will sound like it's about to explode. The graphics are no better then my Ken Griffey game for N64.Apart from all that, I have to say overall there still is not a baseball game that is a real simulation. Baseball fans want a real game, not this baseball 2020 stuff. (remember that game from genesis!)"
1,worst game ever besides high heat baseball 2003,"The gameplay is horrible, the graphics are horrible and the overall game is horrible. For example, when you pitch, you can't even choose where the ball goes. all you choose is the general section of the plate and whether it is a ball or a strike. When you bat it is basically the same thing, you just choose a general area and it swings there.This game is the worst fifty dollars i have spent in my life. Don't buy this game"
3,great game with fatal problems,"The gameplay is excellent. An excellent simulation and lots of fun. However, having played it for a few days, i've noticed some very bad flaws. These have all cropped up while trying to play a season/career (isn't that the point of this game?). Basically, everything is going along fine and you're in to your season/career, and then some bug will occur, and the whole thing will freeze up. This has happened to me a few times while exiting out of a game (so you have to revert to what was saved before the game) and worse, towards the end of a season the thing would just freeze up and not let me continue with my season (that i had spent hours on). Yes, the game is great and lots of fun. But after all the effort the put into making the career mode so deep, you'd think they could iron out the bugs, but they haven't. To me, nothing ruins a game faster than technical bugs like this. I'm throwing mine away and trying a different game that won't dissapoint in this way. Beware!"
2,too easy,i got this game for my birthday and i tried it out. but its too easy. i was bombing a homer every single time! i was even on the all-star setting!
5,best baseball game since ken griffey jr for super nitendo,"This is a awesome game. I like the controllers,like you can't cheat like the other baseball games. What i mean is you choose if you want to pich a ball or a strike. I love the way you do that. The other way is harder and a better way to cheat. Like when you pich it then you move the ball around, then when your about to swing the person your playing against can just change the pich to a ball or something else. This is truely the funnest baseball game of all time. I love ""Ken Griffey Jr"" for super nitendo, but I have to say this beats it."
5,Much Better Live!,"This CD shows SOS at their best, mixing their sound with latin jazz (witness the incredible spanglish[?] rumba/slasa/samba version of Circulate). Also there's a little reggae (Am I the Same Girl), and the samba intro in Breakout. Too bad their record company is just too ignorant to know how to ""market"" them. Corinne, necesitas practicar un poco tu espanol antes de cantar, pero el intento valio la pena!"
4,"Great music, splendid recording","Well, this isn't exactly the GREATEST LIVE POP RECORDING ever, as is suggested elsewhere - I suspect that the Who (""Live at Leeds"") and Bob Dylan (""Before the Flood"") might have something to say about that. But it IS a remarkably well-recorded live album. SOS songs are rich in texture and dynamics, and this live recording is full of sonic details and clarity. The soundstaging is marvelous, and the balance is perfect - one could almost imagine that Steely Dan lent its studio technicians to SOS for the evening to make this record, it's that good.It's disappointing that SOS doesn't have a larger following in the U.S. They certainly are very, very accomplished at working successfully within the realm of the perfectly-composed and -polished pop tune. They're not Burt Bachrach or Jimmy Webb, but it's not going too far to say that they have shown themselves to be honorable and faithful spiritual successors."
5,Ibbotson's Best Work Yet!,The Star of Kazan charms readers with well drawn characters in this smooth and appealing novel for everyone. There is less whimsy and more realism then many of Ibbotson's other novels for children. Although the writing isn't always perfectly clear it is still very readable and all the plot twists are cleverly tied up in the end.
4,Heidi Meets Annie,"I felt like the basic story was very much Heidi meets Annie.Simple girl, goes to rich folks, finds her true home, that kind of thing.The ending was truly priceless, and I think the story appeals on a lot of levels..."
2,Needs a new ending,"This book was very good. But i think this book needs a new ending. It kind of just stopped. Also, i think that you know that Eldurtart stole the jewels all along."
1,Know what kind of card slot you have.,"I bought this mouse for my husband for Christmas. We both checked it out rather thoroughly and nowhere do any of the specifications mention that there are different kinds of slots. If you know what you're looking for, you can tell from the pictures but it never occurred to either one of us that it wouldn't fit. The website pictures a USB charger that can be attached but apparently no one sells it. I can't rate this because I can't use it!!!!"
1,Needs a PC card slot TYPE 2!,"I cannot charge with my PC card slot. Be advised, you need a type 2 card slot. Otherwise you will not be able to charge this product by any means."
4,Its good if you Can only use this one,"Honestly its a solid mouse with a great battery life just no scrolling capabilitys in the actual hardware. Not a huge deal as long as you know this before you buy it. There are other mogo Mice on the market but none that fit the same PC slot as this one, if you have the option get the other ones but otherwise this is a great mouse and verry portableAlso it does fit flush with the machine when in the slot so theres no risk of damage or getting it caught on things"
1,Dead On Arrival,"I was anxious to try out the product, and was aware of the mixed reviews. The product didn't turn on when plugged in, which leads me to believe that the battery life of these things is awful. I'm assuming it's due to sub-par materials used. Newton isn't a big company, so I'm not surprised that the quality is poor. I paid ~$50 and requested and recieved a refund. Yay amazon, nay MoGo."
2,Lack of Windows 7 support,"The advertisement fails to tell you the parent company does not support this mouse for Windows 7, also they fell to mention the is no scrolling wheel. The mouse works with Windows 7. This mouse is intended for old laptops that come with the PCIM slot. Most new laptops don't have this feature. I have a Lenovo R 500 that has the slot. It charges well and seems to hold the charge. The Bluetooth connects quickly and the mouse sleeps after 10 minutes to save power. I got this mouse through Amazon for 20 dollars including shipping. Unlike most newer mice you must use a mouse pad for smooth operation.After having this mouse for a extended period I have for the most part stopped using it. I purchased a Microsoft Arch and it is far superior to this product. It is not Bluetooth but comes with micro receiver. Stay away from this product and avoid its aged abilities."
3,Great idea. Not the greatest tracking,"I love the idea of this thing. It's so great that it's always with my laptop so I don't have to worry about cords or batteries. The tracking of the mouse isn't the greatest. It seems to need a really good surface to track well, and even then it jumps around a bit."
1,Just doesn't work. Fails to remain paired.,"When you buy from Tiger Direct, if you find the item just doesn't work with your computer (but may work with some other computer that you don't have), then you are stuck. Unless the manufacturer agrees that the item you bought is defective (meaning it doesn't work at all for anyone), no refund.So I suggest not buying this mouse from Tiger Direct. As you can see from the feedback, for many people it just doesn't work. It doesn't mean it is defective necessarily, because perhaps it works with some computers. But Dell laptops seem to have an especially hard time remaining paired with it, making it useless to me. Badly designed not to work more generally, and a bad seller for not accepting returns."
1,Hate it,"Awesome idea, just a bad interpretation of it. Tracking precision was TERRIBLE. I tried it on a few different Dell Latitude notebooks, all with the same result. Didn't matter if a mouse pad was used, or just a table top. It was OK (barely) just with clicking on hyperlinks, closing apps, etc. But if you want to highlight anything or get better than 1/8"" accuracy forget it - you'll pull your hair out trying. I wish I could return it... but it was only twenty bucks. Its now sitting in my drawer."
4,Quite a useful item!,"After looking around for a mouse to go with my laptop (my wrists were hurting with using the trackpad too much), I decided to try a mogo. I don't like cords or the idea of carrying around extra junk, so the idea that it was stored in the pc slot was great for me. Now the thing is pretty expensive new, but I bought a used one with a lower battery life for cheaper from amazon to give it a try. I am sure the thing took a lot of abuse, but man, it is still a very good item. Ok, so the battery charge won't hold for more than, oh, 2-3 hours for me, but it was a used one in the first place so I can hardly dock it much for that. What I really like is that the design makes me hold my wrist up properly, rather than being lazy and resting it on the mouse, so I really notice less wrist strain with it. The one thing I don't like is that with the triangle type design I can see the laser underneath sometimes, and I'm not sure that's great for the eyes, but really that's just a small detail."
2,MoGo Mouse - didn't deliver...,"I'm a bit disappointed with this BlueTooth wireless PCMCIA mouse as the cursor is not steady and quite jittery when I use it. This happens on all the desks in my workplace. On a mouse pad the jittering effect lessens, but there are still small jumps instead of a smooth mouse.In short, it didn't live up to my expectations."
4,"Excellent, simple to use product","The MoGo has been great - there is no setup, no driver, nothing extra - just plug the MoGo into the PC card slot, read through the directions once, and go. I love that I always have the mouse with me without having to remember to carry or charge it. And the mouse action is very smooth and the form is easy to get used to.My only complaint, and the reason I only gave 4 stars, is the lack of the scroll button. Maybe the next version? Otherwise, perfect!"
3,Not a good fit,"Got this for my husband who travels a lot. When he went to put it in the PCMCIA slot it was too thick to fit. We checked the computer specs to make sure it was PCMCIA type II. It was, but this would not fit so it had to go back. It's a good idea, it just didn't fit"
4,Not bad,"I recieved the prodct with no instructions but i found some online for a diffrent product. Also, either im doing something wrong or the laser pointer feature just doesnt work at all."
5,I love this mouse!,"This is a great solution for a portable mouse. I spend more time than I care to admit in meetings and this is the perfect solution. It sits in my PC Card slot, so I always have it with me. When I'm in a meeting, I just grab it out and I have a mouse to use.This is not a perfect mouse, but it is a great compromise for a portable mouse. It works very well, fits my hand reasonably, is comfortable to use and does not require me to carry an extra thing with me to have a mouse available.After over a year of regular use, the battery has weakened quite a bit (still about an hour of runtime). I looked around at alternatives and still plan on buying another one of these, even though it appears they may not be manufactured any more."
4,Have to see it to believe it!,"I just purchased a MoGo mouse, and I'm *amazed* at how usable it is. I was extremely skeptical (and probably wouldn't have bought one) until I was able to try a colleague's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is. The ONE thing - and it's a pretty big thing - is the lack of ""scroll-wheel"" technology. That's a sorely missed feature in this mouse.That said, there are always trade-offs, but in this case that's the only one. Battery life seems great, usability is great, convenience is great...just add the touch pad and it'll be THE mouse for notebook computer users!"
3,Just a good mouse.,"I could not give this great rating. I really love the slim design and how it stores and charges in my Mac's PC card slot. That makes it very convenient. It's always with my laptop and always charged. BUT...the infrared works lousy on it compared to other mouses. Unless you use it on a mouse pad, the mouse performs very poorly. Others, I used worked very well on desk-tops, sheets of paper, books etc.. This one does not. Maybe they improved the new one."
2,"Good introduction, but nothing more.","This book could serve as a good introduction to the software for those who are completely new to the application. However, it offers nothing more than the Macromedia documentation does. In fact, I found the Macromedia documentatin to be more valuable the the content of this book.Not to be looked at if you're looking for advanced information. I'd only recommend it to those who are intimidated by the Macromedia documentation."
3,Buyer Beware,"I too was very excited about Lynda's book on Dreamweaver 2. I waited anxiously as it was released from the publisher, and ordered my copy the day it was available. Unfortunately, as you get further and deeper into the book, her broken links, absent files and poorly written examples that are just plain wrong leave you feeling more and more frustrated. Since there are literally no good books available on Dreamweaver, this is just a discomfort one must suffer if you wish to learn this program. I only wish that Lynda and her editors would proof her work before it is published."
5,"Fast, easy help for the desperate & impatient!","I came into this with no website-building experience and I needed to build one as quickly as I could. I looked at a couple of books to learn how to use Dreamweaver and this one met my expectations in EVERY way! If you like to feel comfortable with a big picture about a program before you start pushing buttons and messing around, get this book."
4,Fantastic!,"I wish that the episode guide came with the set. The rest seem to and I was forced to print the guide out myself, a waste of ink and money"
5,"Dragon Ball, Season 4","Season 4 was a good season. King Piccolo wants the Dragon Balls to wish for eternal youth. He believes that once he regains his youthful strength, he will be unstoppable. Goku battles King Piccolo and his deciples to avenge the deaths caused by King Piccolo and his men."
5,DB Season 4,"Another great season. The episodes continued to tell of the saga of Goku. If you've been watching the first three seasons, the fourth will not disappoint."
3,Small Bag,"I guess I should have read the dimensions of the bag, because I was disappointed on the size. The bag is so tiny, cute but tiny. I wish I would they would have made this style bigger. The bigger bag that was similar to this had the coin purse in the front which I did not like. To me the bag is a little overpriced for as tiny as it is. but the style of the bag is CUTE!!!"
1,"Rushed Story, Little character development","That's the impression I got after reading this book. The Avengers go on this confusing adveture to stop Morgan Le Fay before she destroys all reality. It's a very confusing plot and there is little character development throughout the whole story. The end where the new Avengers roster is created, also looks like it was put together at the last moment."
2,definitely full of it,"With teen movies about geeks in high school just trying to catch a break and be at least tolerated, some movies excel (Can't Buy Me Love, Three O Clock High, Pretty in Pink, and the stellar 10 things I Hate About You) some are reasonably acceptable (She's All That, Jawbreaker)and then there are those that try really hard but end up just as geeky as their star nerd. Full Of It falls into this final category. While the movie does have it's moments of clever fun, the whole thing is ruined by a young and talented actor (Pinkston) who injects way too much slapstickiness into his role. He is giddily foppish at best and hopelessly silly at worst. Still, the film does have a certain charm in it's message, although the viewer shouldn't have to feel like they are watching a three stooges movie to get it. 2.25 stars"
2,not for little boys,ok i am a parent who thought that this would be a good movie to teach my son about lieing. i saw what other people wrote so i bought it and watched it with him. the movie hade a good story about what happend when you lie and get caught up in it which is a good thing. why i gave it a poor grade is because in his wish the teacher in the movie and the populer girl in the movie he wished that they were in love with him and the teacher and the girl were throwing them at this little boy all the way through the movie until the end when things went back to normal. now like i said this movie hade a good story about lieing but i didnt like the part with the teacher and the girl. i thought if you have someone that just saw that part and didnt get it than it sent the wrong message. like i said i am a parent with a teeage boy and i didnt like that part. so be aware of it before you buy it.
5,La Stupenda,"La Stupenda shows us the most phenomenal technique of our time. At her prime, no other colortura in memory can touch her in terms of beauty of tone, amazing flights of fioritura, and the most ravishing trill I've ever heard. So many beautiful arias here to show the diva's voice off!"
3,Needs improving,"Vine's book is adequate, but not one of the best on the market for introducing Koine, or Biblical Greek. Here are the reasons:(1) Small type format(2) Grammar focus(3) Neglects writing the Greek Alphabet(4) Minimal illustrationThe highly compacted textual format, serves as a discouragement to pick up."
2,"Not a ""Do-it-yourself"" book","This was and is used as a seminary textbook nationwide. As such, it is excellent. However, without the oversight and help of a professor, this book is of very little use. It is written in an archaic style and needs much more explanation if it is to be useful for the at home layperson."
3,Clearly This Books Is About Sex Not Tantra,"Anybody who knows what Tantra is essentially about or teaches will know that this book is not about practising Tantra but enjoying sex in tantric positions.If you are new to Tantra, you will be misled by this book. But if you aim is just to try out something new and enjoy sex, this book is okay."
4,The Essential Tantra,"I have just broken into the world of Tantra and this book was very helpful to further introducing me to it, It has allowed my wife and I to break into a world that we have always known was there yet have been unable to access."
5,Excellent deal for the price!,"This machine works Great and is very easy to refill. The unit is well-designed. There is a hold tab on the top of the water tank, so it is easy to insert into base. It has a handle on the bottom of the water tank, so it is easy to carry and refill the tank. Overall, a good little unit for the price."
1,Smelled of smoke,"This humidifier really is easy to use, fill, and clean. However, within the first week of owning it, using it according to directions, it smelled as if it were smoking/burning. It did this on two separate occasions. It really smelled as if the motor would catch fire. I returned it and won't be buying another one."
5,Finally...,"For anyone out there who, like me (a student of palaeontology), has struggled with the constant head-butting between what the Bible and science says about the history of the earth, this book is a much-needed remedy. Godfrey and Smith do a magnificent job at taking an HONEST look at the issues, and together reach conclusions supportive of, if not bolstering, both science and the Christian faith. Read this book: you'll never think about trace fossils, rain, and the story of the Garden of Eden the same way again. Better said: you'll never take them for granted again. I cannot give this book enough praise."
3,"nice size, but flimsy","This cutter is so malleable, that even when it's put in a box by itself, it didn't arrive round. I don't know how it's going to make round cuts in the dough, since it moves and deforms at hand pressure. Usually Fox Run cutters are sturdier. I'm disappointed."
5,"A solid, insightful, ""user friendly"" presentation","Martial Arts America: A Western Approach To Eastern Arts by Bob Orlando (martial arts expert and founder of the Je-du-to School of Martial Arts, Denver Colorado) is a solid, insightful, ""user friendly"" presentation of how martial arts are taught in America today ranging from self-defense, to sport, to the different challenges in training male and female students, to what a black belt really means. A superbly presented background book and very highly recommended reading for anyone contemplating a martial arts program, Martial Arts America warns seekers of self-defense about what to search for and what to look out for when seeking a suitable school. If you are contemplating learning the martial arts in a formal program of instruction, begin your search with a careful reading of Bob Orlando's Martial Arts America."
5,A must read,"If you are a martial artist or a martial arts instructor this book is a must read. Even if you don't agree with all of his conclusions Bob Orlando brings up points we MUST consider before we claim to teach, or know, self-defense via martial arts. I have nothing but respect for Bob, both as a martial artist and a thinker. Marc ""Animal"" MacYoung"
1,Not too impressed...,"We received the clock quickly, within days of ordering. Unfortunately, when we put in the batteries, it did not work. We tried different batteries to be sure, but the clock did not function. Since it was the design I wanted for my kitchen we ended up just buying the parts to repair it ourselves instead of going through the return process."
3,"good read, takes a while to claim your attention","This starts out as being wildly improbable. The hero is a painter and one of his creations starts talking to him. At first it seemed shallow compared to most Regencies. But, it sort of grew on me. I gave it three stars, which means a good read but not a book I'm likely to keep or re-read. It's good for an afternoon's reading."
1,awful,In my opinion this was just absolutely dreadful... poorly written.... improbable...ok yes... it is supposed to be improbable.. but it's not done in a cute way.... definitely would not recommend you purchase ... if you must try it... get it from the library... not worth your money...if not your time...
4,not enough of a good thing,"This is a terrific hand cream. When you first apply it you may think it is too greasy but suddenly your skin just drinks it in. You don't need to use much but still, my only complaint is that 2.54 oz is a VERY small tube. Would like to see larger size."
1,Smells horrible,I'm not sure how well this product works after just using it a time or two I couldn't get over the terrible smell.
1,"Bulky, cheap,","I purchased one size bigger than my dress size Due to the other reviews. It fit fine. Although the product did not fit well under clothes as stated in the description, It was very very bulky. Also, after 2 weeks of use it ripped."
4,Good for collectors,"There are a fair number of songs on this CD that are difficult to find elsewhere and fun to listen to. It's a good supplement to the other Etting collections, and a curiosity as far as Morgan goes. Beware, though, that some of these were dug up deep from the vaults and are of pretty poor sound quality."
4,"Great Product, a little tedious","I bought this product because I was expecting to use it as a blanket more than as an outdoors sleeping bag.It's very warm, yet for my purposes, the tight space to keep your feet warm may be a little too small and the string locks really get in the way of your confort whether you use it as blanket or as an outdoors sleeping bag.Overall I did enjoy it, because I was hoping to reduce not so warm and several blankets from my bed, leaving just an old, yet warm sleeping bag, and this very sleeping bag I purchased."
5,The meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion,I am enjoying this new approach to the Jewish concept of God. I have been having a hard time relating to the old God. Kaplan makes my relationship meaningful.
2,Clock Tower 3 :: Just rent it,"The game can be freaky at times. I mean, some maniacs chase after you and pop out from various places, but you can finish this game fairly quickly. The story is interesting, and the scare factor is all right. But at times..you can't help but laugh at how some of these ""maniac stalkers"", can be so corny and resemble some type of walking-character at Disneyland. And after a while, you don't get as scared. But if you really want interesting plot lines, or just want to pee in your pants out of fright, I suggest playing Fatal Frame 1 and especially, Fatal Frame 2, or the Silent Hill games...those are classics. But with any game video game, renting is always a good option before purchasing."
2,Piece of crap?,"This game, (as I do agree with some people) really does suck. I love capcom but I can believe capcom would come out with a piece of junk like this. It can be fun at some parts throughout the game, but only a few. Also there were a few glitches, and the controlls were messed up. Other bad things include the stragety guide! You don't even need it! They messed that up too and you dont need it except it has some hints. Also, some of the bosses you have to beat can take FOREVER, I repeat forever! I spent about an hour or two on this one boss!If you like games like Resident Evil or silent hill kind of horror games this a great game to get! But if your like me and can't stand stupid unrealilistic horror shooting games don't buy this (although it can be fun at times!"
4,My veiw of this game,I couldn't wait till this game out when I saw the cover and once I rented it to check it out I became very annoyed that you have to run away all the time from the monsters and you have no weapons to fight with except for holy water but that doesn't kill them. The graphics are fairly good but the box looked better... but unless you like playing whimpy girls that run and scream all the time then this is the game for you
2,Disappointing!,"I can't believe this game was rated so high by others. I think it's an awful game, totally boring, and I regret purchasing it. It failed to hold my interest. I quit playing after the first boss. A horror/mystery fan, I bought it hoping it would be similar to Resident Evil 4, but it's not even close. A young girl goes around and gets attacked by ghosts. She has no weapon other than holy water and quickly gets panicked into death. Her movements are awkward. The battles are awkward. The graphics aren't very good and the game is not challenging. I feel that the game wasn't developed as well as it could have been, and overall, I'd say it was disappointing. I suggest that you rent it before you buy it."
3,So-so,"Clock tower 3 isnt a bad game- but it's not really a good game either. The graphics are top notch, some of the best on the ps2, and the cinemas are incredible. However after an hour or so into the game, the tedium sets in. get this key, open that, hide here so the monster (called subordinates) wont see you, use this item to fight off the monster, etc. There are some frightening moments and for sure this game earned it's Mature rating, but the puzzle solving and the game itself could be completed by the most inexpercienced gamer, as long as they know to check each room throughly. The orginal clocktower for the ps1 was an awesome game, but the two sequels don't live up to the series' promise. The control is bad, and the boss battles are easy and repetitive. I am about 3 hours into the game right now and (I think) am about half way through. Rent it just to see the graphic cinemas, and the story is down right disturbing (albeit it doesn't make a bit of sense), but don't buy it."
3,Game for the horror flick maniacs.,"I played the Japanese version of this game with great expectation as a horror game fan and it turned out tobe a nice horror game but has some flaws.The director of this game was ( He's gone just after making this game) a famous Japanese film director. ( See for the "" Royal Battle"" - Mega Hit film in Japan ) So the game goes with horrormovie narative style. Blood gores are everywhere and the graphicsare Kodak film tone .THe problem is- This is too much horror movie , not the game.The girl is chasing by the monsters or freaky ghostsand that's so scary. But she doesn't have any means to fight back but to run or hide. Well, in the end of every stage, she has the chance to fight against the ghost. But tha's not sochallenging and even boring.Overall, this game is so scary and makes your heart beating by the frightness. But as a game itself, it needs some more.So you'll see what I'm trying to emphasize."
4,Uhh...,"Yah, from what I've read, the game sounds kinda cool, but the fact that you have to use a crossbow kinda takes the fun out of it... Is it anything like the Silent Hill series?"
1,Looks Great But It Is Terrible,"I bought this game about a month ago thinking that it would be great... But I waS WRONG! This game was teribble. You can't even fight the bad guys who chase you. Some people say thats what makes this game so good but I think you should be able to arm yourself with a weapon because when they chase you all you can do is hide. If you ask me thats not very exciting. Ohh and you get holy water to freeze the bad guys. I mean what kind of crap is that? Also when people put this game in the same catagory as resident evil, Silen hill, and fatal frame it gets me mad. A game this bad dosen't deserve to be catagorized with those awesome games. Yes it is scary and the graphics are great but it dosen't make up for the diffuculty, controls, boringness, and all the other flaws in the game. If your lookin for a great game to scare you get Silent Hill, Resident Evil, or Fatal Frame 1 & 2. I warned you DON'T GET THIS GAME!"
2,Not as good and great as Clock Tower Pt.1,There are simple reasons to know why Clock Tower 3 is just completely dull:1.The game is just too short.2.It isn't fun as the first Clock Tower.3.It needs better gaming.Toss it away or just rent it instead.
1,Do Not buy this game!!!,"This game is a complete waste of time. It is just too hard to play. I think I know how to play video games, having played them since they first came out in the early 70's. Having a monster chasing you all the is not my idea of fun. And having 3 shots of water as your only weapon sucks! You die before you can get to refill. When you use water it only last a few moments. After playing for 2 days I QUIT! I wish Amazon would let me put a zero in the star ratings."
5,Always loved this game,"This game is epic and i think everyone needs to try it. Without a doubt it is also one of the most heart pounding games ive played. You cant actually fight the bosses until the end of every level, so if you encounter them before then, your only action is to run. all the while her panic meter is soaring. great game"
3,Not sure about this game,"I started to play this game and got bored with it. So I started another game and went back to it a couple of weeks later. Still bored. Overall the idea is great, but I just can't get into it. I hope that this review does not discourage people, it just isn't my cup of tea."
4,Games,"This game is strange yet exciting. Moments of fustration yet a keep going mentality that wont quit to you get it done. Its exciting and fullfilling at the same time. That i cant wait till its over to , i cant stand it anymore . Play it....its Cool"
4,"A good game, flawed, but good.","I wasn't too fond of the Clock Tower series until I picked this game up. It definately caught my attention with impressive CG, the music is pretty moody for the situation.Overall, for gameplay, expect the 3-d look your used to seeing in Resident Evil. Run around, find items, solve puzzles, avoid enemies, and the like. But this game does have moments that will give you a good jump. And since you can't just blow them away with a gun like other Survival Horror games, it brings a new kind of feel to it. Plus it puts a little more strategy into your movements.This game isn't perfect though, some may find the puzzles too easy, the game is fairly short, and after time, being chased by the subordinates can get more annoying than scary. However, it is worth a look, if not a purchase, then at least rent it."
3,very very irretating game!!!!,"You play as fifteen to be Alyssa. A teenager girl who unwillngly became one of the Rooders, a family swore to protect against entities who sole purpose to turn the world into a darkness. The graphics are very cool and the game play is similar to other Capcom adventure games (i.e. Resident Evil). It doesn't take lots of brain to solve the puzzles but the irretating part is you must avoid the monsters during the process. I say irretaing because you can not run away from the mosters every time you open a door you face the mosters and even with running away they would follow you. You can use hidden places or evading points to skip the monster grips but once you leave the room the moster will follow you leaving you no joy playing the game. The only thing you can do is to solve the puzzles while the monster sniffing around little Alyssa behind. Don't buy this game if you don't like running away and if you have a short tember."
4,I like the book...McVicker's book pulled me in,Entertaining read. McVicker provides a good yarn. Larger then life characters and twists in a real life story. Top notch tale.
3,Well Told and True about a Jail Breaker and Con Man in Love,"The story is told straightforwardly-- not overcrowded with detail. It's like a long version of a McVicker article in the alternative weekly the Houston Press, such an article almost certainly being the genesis of this tome. For all of Russell's truly amazing feats as a jail breaker and a con man. that his cynical thievery is punctuated by and contrasts with his apparent real love for his boyfriend, Russell is two-dimensional. He doesn't seem to speak to any deeper meaning. If you don't need that, this book is first-rate."
5,excelent,Excellent reading. Could not put the book down. Looking forward to the film. That is how I discovered the book.
1,Overpriced Garbage,"Cheap, plastic, non-refillable, and the safety button on mine broke after light use, rendering the lighter inoperable. You can purchase better lighters for $3-5."
5,So Far the Best,"This hands-on book is a must-read for anybody starting out with Flash MX 2004. It is concise but filled with actual screen shots, and the step by step instructions are clear and easy to follow. All of the examples that you are asked to work through actually ...work, and there is no annoying disconnect between what the book describes and what really happens with your own Flash environment on your computer. Interspersed here and there are valuable tips and explanations about Flash's features. I have read half a dozen books on Flash, and so far this is the best and most enjoyable."
4,Very good,"I haven't read the entire book, yet. But, what I've read it seems well written and easy to understand. There are some areas that I wished they would have put more detail into and some that are repeated so many time, I want to say ""Alright, already, I get it"".I'm relatively new to ActionScript and have read a number of Flash and ActionScript books. If you only have one ActionScript 2.0 book for Flash MX 2004, then this should be the one."
3,"Excellent Examples, Mediocre Reference","I find the book useful but hard to use as a reference. I agree that the examples are detailed and easy to follow and I like the book for fully exploring a topic (e.g., video). As a reference, it's too hard to drill down into the single fact that I need. For example, when I tried to lookup the syntax for AttachMovie, I couldn't find it, just examples. Also, the index is incomplete and lacking the most obvious terms such as 'remoting' which can be found in chapter 35, sending and loading data. For a reference, the O'Reilly book ActionScript - The Definitive Guide is much better (too bad it hasn't been updated to MX2004)."
4,Great for those who like to do it themselves!,This book gives you all the basics to build a great deck. I bought it and built a deck on my home.... came out awesome... and I have almost no building experience!
2,A word of caution!,"When you buy them at first it's great, it includes all dub episodes without the TV edits so any scenes of guns and stuff are left unedited and the japanese words are left unchanged, BUT I bought this and when I watched it, it was awsome, then after just 2 months of having watched them I put the DVD's again and the DVD's are corrputed and no DVD player will show them, and they don't even have a scratch on them, it's like it changed format on it's own, not even my laptop will play them, and it happened to all but the first disc. I also bought season 3 but fortunately it hasn't gone through this, this is a bootleg and a very bad one too since the discs are only good for a month or so, then they get damaged so please be cautious when buying"
3,Digi 4,"The season overall was okay. It was not exceptional, but it wasn't bad either. It had some really great moments. It does not beat the very first season."
1,Long term review,"I had Dewalt drills for 10 years. They were always good with the exception of the batteries. I switched to the Hitachi drill hoping for better batteries, I was disappointed. I work construction and use the drill everyday. I will admit the drill gets alot of hard use. The first thing I noticed about the Hitachi drill is that it has quite a bit less torque in the high setting than the Dewalt. My drill is now 1 year old and no longer works. For the last 10 months the drill would get hot real fast. After drilling a 5/8"" hole,with a new bit, through 10"" of wood, the drill now only works in reverse. This time I will spend my money on a Dewalt. This drill would probably work for most people but if you do construction for a living then you should pass on this drill. The hammerdrill option worked well. The light was too dim to be useful."
1,DO NOT BUY,The case broke the first time I used it and now the keyless chuck is stripped. Yeah it has a 5 year warranty but I have to drive all over to get to one and the parts always take weeks to arrive. I thought Hitachi was so good boy am I wrong. I will NEVER buy a Hitachi tool again.
5,I'm in love!!!!,"Ok, I got this as part of a buy 2 get one free deal at Ulta today. Figured I'd give it a shot since I'm already a Paul Mitchell hair care fan. When I got home I gave it a go and WOW!!!! I could see a difference right away! I have frizzy, thick hair and this stuff tamed it pretty much right away. What I love the best though is that it doesn't feel like there's anything in my hair at all. I just spray it on and it does the moisturizing without the greasy feel. Definitely worth a try, it worked for me and I will keep using it definitely!"
2,Save your money,"Doesn't add much moisture to the hair and doesn't even detangle that well. Save your money...you're better off buying ""No More Tangles."""
2,"don't but - damaged, crap","bulb arrived broke. Called recieved $10 credit promptly but probably spent $5 on gas. BURN! Assembly is awkward.The workmanship is average at best, ie Chinese crap. Probably should have sent it back. Found better lamp at Fred Meyer in Medford for $36. Ended throwing it out."
5,Guitar LEGEND,"Vai is wicked. I have always loved him because he never ceases to be original. The man can do some serious fingerwork. He gave me his autograph at the Rose Bowl when I was around twelve years old and visiting California. I will NEVER forget that. That was extremely cool of him. The silver getup is strange, and the song with his little boy is endearing. The DVD was clean and crisp visually, and the sound was great. There are extra features, such as the ability to program the song order, a mini-interview, short but concise biography, a complete discography, and different angles for four songs. In other words, this DVD should have costed well over the price I paid for it. His undulating sexy body wrapped around that guitar sure was worth my $15!SONGS INCLUDE: Bad Horsie/ Juice/ Die to Live/ The Boy From Seattle/ Ya-Yo Gak/ Kill the Guy With the Ball/ Tender Surrender"
2,Milli Vanili eat your hearts out,"I must apologise for what I am about to say as I am a huge Vai fan. But I was a little upset by the fact that there was no warning whatsoever that the performances captured on this DVD were not live recordings. Three guys making the motions whilst a CD is playing in the background is hardly fair to fans who appreciate real music played on real instruments by real people. I know a lot of fans will jump on me hard for this but I consider it an abomination for an artist who has yet been spoiled by the trappings of the plastic pop world to produce such an effort. I only hope it was an oversight and will never happen again. Over the video release the DVD does have the added optional feature of Vai's commentry over the tracks which is sometimes insightful, but overall you are really not getting more than the CD (which, by the way, is great)"
3,What hath MTV wrought?,"There is no mistaking that Vai is the best guitarist out there - hands down. There is also no mistaking MTV has ruined any video presentation of today's music. Vai could have easily plugged in and played it live, instead of playing along with the playback. Believe me - he could do it. I find it fustrating when capable artists coast; when a magnificent visual production could've been a reality. And what a marketing concept; buy the CD and hear it polished & perfect, buy the video and see it live, raw and playable - as opposed to merely a studio product."
3,Alien Love Child DVD Review,"It was only a matter of days after seeing Steve Vai play live on the most recent G3 tour with Joe Satriani and John Petrucci that I decided to purchase this disk. There is nothing more exciting than seeing Vai play live, he is one of the most captivating performers of all time.That being said, you can imagine my disappointment when, during the first song, I realized that this is a collection of music videos and not live performances. I kept trying to tell myself at least I could still watch Steve's showmanship, but that thought went away every time I saw the drummer tap another crash cymbal.I know millions of people watch MTV to see their favorite artist pantomime their songs, but it just seems wrong to watch Vai do that.I'm not sorry I bought it; I'm happy to have it in my collection. I just won't be watching it much."
4,"Wonderful Audio Quality, Mediocre Video Quality","If you like Vai it is well worth the money even with the poor quality of the video transfer. Basically a collection of performance videos for all the songs. DVD also contains an audio track with Steve explaining each of the songs (inspirations, etc.) along with some other cool features. I just wish they would have spent a little more time and money to get a killer video track to go along with the killer audio."
5,Nice Toy,This was a nice toy for my nephew. His parents have a regular dart board in their game room that they mounted this one right next to! now the whole family can play without the worry of sharp pointy darts being hurled by small children! The price has skyrocketed since I bought it but I guess that just comes with the territory of the season. Glad I got mine early!
2,Eh...if you want just a normal dart board they won't kill eachother with it's ok.,"I purchased this for my son for Christmas. Unfortunately, we had to go away for a few weeks after Christmas and just tried this and we all hate it. The ""fast"" is more of a slow tumble and the slow is a hesitation a jump and then nothing. Truthfully it bites the big one! I would return it but it's too late. I tried changing the batteries and that didnt help either. :("
1,DISAPPOINTED,I AM A BIG FAN OF MS. PICOULT BUT THIS BOOK WAS MY LEAST FAVORITE. THE COMIC STRIPS WERE VERY DISTRACTING AND THE STORYLINE WEAK.
2,Very Disappointed...,"I've read two other books by the author, My Sister's Keeper (utterly fabulous) and The Pact (Amazing)... so I was thrilled to spot this one in the library. In my humble opinion, it is not nearly as good as the two I've read by her. Some parts just drug on and on and I found myself skipping pages of it or skimming through parts because they were just so boring and I didn't have to do that with either one of the other titles. To me the story line was just too confusing and like she was trying to cram like 5 different life stories into one novel and it was just... too much. And very few of the characters were people you became interested in.. they were all just static characters for me.. trixie was the only interesting one. I'll read others by her but this one is disappointing."
3,Not a typical Picoult novel.,"Anyone who is an avid Picoult reader usually buys her books knowing a little bit of what to expect....and loving it! When I started reading this book I guess I just kept waiting for the trial to start! I am a huge Jodi Picoult fan and will probably always be, however this book just didn't do it for me. Perhaps others will enjoy it more. As for me I'll just start on my next Picoult journey and put this one behind me."
3,First Picoult book I have read,"This is the first Picoult book I read. I am not a huge fan of Picoult, after Reading Mercy I dont think I will ever read a book of hers again. The books are so dark and negetive that I just have a hard time reading about things so negetive."
3,First read of Jodi's,"This was the first book I read of Jodi's. After reading 3 others, it is my least favorite, and yet good enough that I was interested in keeping up with her other books. I liked the first half, but the second half lost me. It went from believable to unbelievable and I was wishing it would end sooner than it did. Having said that, her writing inspires me as a writer, and often I say out loud ""that was BRILLIANT"" when a turn of events or more depth into a character really blows me away. She has a grasp on human behaviour that is nothing short of a gift. I encourage others who read this to try some of her other books, and you will see what I mean. They do not disappoint. This one to me was average of many other brilliantly written novels."
2,I tried to like this,"I picked this one up because it was cheap, and I did enjoy ""My Sister's Keeper"" but by the time I was nearing the end of the book, I just just skimming to be done with it. The story was interesting enough, but like someone else mentioned, there is a LOT of unnecessary detail in the book. She mentions at least twice that the girls wear North Face coats, and listen to ipods. Really? I didn't need to know these things. I don't need to know that Trixie likes sephora, and what brand of jeans she likes.I tried, but this was a disappointing book all around."
4,"Enjoyable read, just not great.","I should say this is the first book by this offer I've read. I liked the concept of the story, following along Dantes Inferno, and for the most part it was a good read. I disagree with some of the other people that said it was unbelievable - I think that was the point of the story. How far do we go to believe and believe in the people we love? And she's incredibly creative and descriptive, which was good at the beginning, but then it started to get a little ridiculous. There were some parts that were just plain overly poetic trying to describe a simple task or feeling. The characters were also quite reflective, which bogged down the pace of the story. I found myself skipping paragraphs sometimes, especially at the end, because I just wanted to get back to the story. But otherwise, it was an enjoyable read."
2,Give her a couple of points for trying something different...,"I tend to enjoy Picoult's novels--they're usually an effortless read, an interesting premise, kind of like a nice light custard. This one is different, much darker and not very original in terms of basic plot. It made for a boring read. However, I did appreciate her building upon the comic book idea, a distinctly masculine element (although the ""hidden message"" was hokey), and incorporating Dante's circles of hell into the scheme of her story. The latter was food for thought--is there a hierarchy of sin?"
4,Quick and Enjoyable,"First off I must say, I love the cover! Isn't it intriguing? Well the book does not let you down either! I finished this book in 3 days. It was fast paced and had its expected ups and downs that we all love in our books. However I only gave it a 4 because two thirds of the way through and the whole Alaska thing kinda bogged it down a bit. I didn't really find that situation to be very beleivable considering she is only 14 years old. But overall a good easy read and I would reccommend this book."
2,Too far out,"I have enjoyed Jodi Picoult's other books that I have read, but this one was too odd for me. I didn't like trying to figure out what was going on in the beginning. Just not enjoyable for me."
3,"Love Picoult, didn't like this one.","I found the teenage sex passages disturbing -- I am a senior citizen and am horrified that those activities go on. I did not like the ""comic book"" inserts, either. With all of the other seven Picoult books I own, I finished wishing the book had a sequel! Not this one."
2,Straying afar,"Jodi...write what you know. You are good at getting into the minds of your characters... usually. You almost did OK with Trixie, but blew it with Daniel - at both ages. But don't feel too bad, you can't hit a home run every time you come to the plate."
1,disappointed!,"I've read most of Jodi Picoult's books and have enjoyed them thoroughly but this one really missed the mark. I found the 3 members of this family so dreadful that I had no sympathy for any of them. Trixie was so contrived and I found her whole situation unbeleivable and found that I was actually sympathizing with Jason! Then this wretched family goes and murders him! Neither Trixie, Laura nor Daniel had ANY redeeming characteristics. Life in this family would truly be hell!"
2,Disapointing,"I had bought this book for a future vacation because I generally really like Picoult's books. During a bout of flu, I gave in and started to read it. It's too full of gimmicks, the research for background is too obvious and takes over the story (why Alaska?).The Dante references are much too heavy-handed - we're not complete idiots. I kept waiting for it all to be pulled together but it never happened. I had the definite feeling that Picoult has become bored with what she's doing and tried to make it more interesting, perhaps not for the readers, but for herself. It didn't work for me - I hope it did for her."
1,couldn't finish it,"I couldn't finish it. Full of tired cliches and two-dimensional characters, worn scenarios, and even that notorious parent-freak-out myth, the ""rainbow party"" -- an urban legend so thoroughly debunked that it's mentioned in the Museum of Hoaxes. Picoult clearly doesn't have a foot in reality and I'm sorry I wasted my money on this dreck."
2,Predictable and muddled,"Not impressed by this effort from Picoult, who tackles quite a few topics against the theme of Dante's Inferno. When 14-year-old Trixie Stone is allegedly raped by a popular school athlete, the Stone family crumbles. Dad has a dark secret in his past, mum is having an affair with a questionable sort and Trixie is a cutter, going so far as to engage in the destructive behavior even at school when her stresses seem insurmountable. Making matters worse for the family, the alleged rapist ends up dead and naturally eyes turn toward the Stones.Every subplot is nicely tied up by the end of the book but the journey from here to there seems labored by the weight of tying events to Dante's Inferno. The resolution was telegraphed early on so the truth of what happened to Jason is no surprise. Picoult is a fine storyteller but this one did not appeal."
3,disappointing!,"I have read almost all of Picoult's books and have enjoyed many of them. This one, however,was not her best.......doesn't even make the top five list of Picoult's works! I felt she tried to insert too many themes (ie. date rape,infidelity,drugs,cultural themes to name a few)into the story. There were also many coincidences that occurred in the story that were too far- fetched to make the story believable.I always eagerly await any new books by Picoult.......I think we could have waited longer for this one."
3,Disappointing...,"I am always thrilled when I have the opportunity to crack open a new Jodi Picoult book and always have high hopes that each one will be just as good as the last.Although I may have set my hopes too high for the Tenth Circle, I have to admit that the story was a disspointment for me.The novel follows the Stone family, living in Maine, with Trixie Stone, the high school-aged daughter, the main character of the story. Picoult explores some of the darker sides of teenage reality in this book, including cutting, suicide, sex and alcohol and drug use...but I can't help but feel that the premises and tales were a bit flat and sometimes far-fetched.Although not as riveting as some of Picoult's previous works that I have read, her talents continue to shine through and I would not hesitate to run out and purchase her next work."
2,On a downward spiral,"With each book she writes, Jodi Picoult comes down a level in terms of quality. Rather than narrowing the scope and developing it well, this novel is a pinball machine of ideas, people and issues that never come together. I kept holding out for an ending that would redeem the rest of the story but was disappointed till the final word."
3,It had potential....,"I've always been captivated by Jodi Picoult's writing style and by the unique stories that are present in her books. I was very excited about the Tenth Circle. However, once I began reading it, I realized that this book had fallen short of Jodi's previous books.I found the comic book distracting and its presence took away from the overall story.I still admire Jodi and her writing, but I feel this book was not one of her best."
1,a family of sociopaths,"Are readers meant to sympathize with this family of sociopaths who feel justified in saying or doing anything in the name of family, love, or personal freedom? Picoult's characters' sloppy morals are as bad as her own sloppy grammer. Amusingly, after a discussion of the French subjunctive early in the book, she fails to use the subjunctive case herself throughout the book (i.e. ""she wished she was"" rather than ""she wished she were""). Readers who like rigorous thinking will not care for this book."
1,Needs a disclaimer,"The publisher should state that this is a novel for adolescents. As a Dante scholar, I thought that either the content or form of this work would benefit from the work of the master. However, the prose is so pedestrian and the content so boring that I gave up on about page 60.What's all the hoopla about--marketing skills?"
2,Disappointing,"This is the first Jodi Picoult book that I didn't like. It seemed far fetched and strained. How a young, very protected kid could navigate and survive in the Alaskan wilderness was too much of a stretch. I also didn't think the comics added anything to the book. I think this must have been a 'filler' book - something put together when the author had no good ideas going. Disappointing."
4,Again brilliant from Jodi Picoult,"Jodi Picoults ability to intertwine different worlds and different lives never ceases to amaze me... Thought provoking, conscious examining and on your toes throughout - another brilliant journey"
2,Disappointed Picoult Fan,"I am a big fan of Jodi Picoult but was very disappointed in ""The Tenth Circle."" The first 250 pages or so were very engaging and well written but after that it takes a turn for the worst. The I feel the last third of the book is very unnecessarily drawn out, and creating a story that has nothing to do with the first part of the book. At the end, I just wanted to get it over with to see how it ended. Then at the end, the story just dropped off and I feel like there was no closure. I feel like this really could have been a great book and I still read Picoult's other books."
3,Not My Favorite,"This was not my favorite book by Picoult. It's a sensitive subject and the way the main character twisted her story around so many times got on my nerves. I was also shocked by the activities of the teenagers in the novel. It seemed to come across that all kids acted that way and I know that's not true. I guess I wish Trixie used her own brain but being fourteen I can understand that she was at a confusing age. I liked the setting of Alaska; the details were interesting. I found this to be another quick read, but Salem Falls is still my favorite novel. :)"
1,NOT author's best work,"I love Jodi Picoult, but if this were the first book I'd read by her, I'd never read another. The main character's actions were not believable.To make matters worse, the ""mystery"" was so transparent that a beginning reader could guess the end. This book does not come near the quality of Jodi Picoult's other novels."
2,Not great,"This novel sounds promising, but there were too many things going on with not enough explanation or reasoning - it was hard to be sympathetic to the 14 year old daughter - or to the mother, both of whom made terrible choices - and neither really faced up to the consequences personally (the mother, clearly, had to pay some dues for her crime) - but I didn't feel the characters grew over the course of the book, with the exception of Daniel, and frankly, I didn't believe in his angst. Overall, disappointing."
1,The Tenth Circle rates Dante's Inferno,The Tenth Circle is a deliberately manipulative story meant to play on the reader's emotions. The blurred genre text of graphic novel and primary plot doesn't play well and causes the primary plot to feel stilted and flat. The implausible Alaskan connection of the end doesn't ring true and is so far beyond my willing suspension of disbelief that I ended up hating the entire story. It is the worst book I've read in years.
2,Pass on this one,"Had this not been our monthly book club selection, I never would have bothered to finish The Tenth Circle. Picoult's usage of Dante's Inferno (an excellent read) and comic book illustrations provide hope for a unique tale of a teenage girl, her family, and their personal journey of hell on earth. Instead, we are left with a predictable plot, an abundance of cliches, and a series of characters that elicit no sympathy from the reader. While Picoult's writing style contains enough momentum to carry a reader through, I still found myself sighing with relief when this one came to an end."
2,Unrealistic Characters,"I have read two books by Jodi Picoult, The Tenth Circle and Nineteen Minutes, and I don't plan to read any more of them. In both books, the characters seem exaggerated to the point of being caricatures. They're just not believable as real people. Also, in both books, there is a plot twist at the end which I found completely out-of-character and unrealistic, with very little explanation given by the author."
3,I just didn't feel for the characters,"I was really excited when I started reading this book, but soon realized that I just didn't make any sort of connection with the characters. It was a good book to keep on the side of the tub, but it wasn't a book that I wanted to carry with me to read when I had a few moments."
3,Not one of her best,"I started with My Sister's Keeper about a year ago and I have been devouring Jodi Picoult's books since. Unfortunately The Tenth Circle is definitely not on par with the others. It is truly boring and at times it seems the author is more concerned with showing she can research well rather than pull a decent story together. The ending is quick and rushed. Definitely not one of my favorites. Another reviewer suggested the author slow down and take her time to finish her books, I agree."
