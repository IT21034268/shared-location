4,Nice for price,"Purchased for the gumball machine, Lots of gumballs in jug and good for the price. It filled the top of the 15 inch vintage Candy Gumball Machine."
2,Hard to chew and short-lived flavor,"We purchased this product to re-fill our gumball machine and were generally disappointed by how hard the gum was and how short-lived the flavor was, compared to other refill products we had purchased in the past. Although we liked the price at the time, in retrospect, the purchase did not represent a good value."
1,Money Savings Advise!!!,"Just save your money and time, and just don't buy. The pictured jar of filled to the rim gumballs was not what arrived in the mail. The jar I received was filled just above the Dubble Bubble Gumball sticker. This distortion of the truth has led me to doubt my beliefs, that a picture is worth a thousands words. Don't get me wrong, it was a 53oz jar, but half full is half full. I plan to take the advise of other viewers and take my business to Wal-mart. I would advise others to do the same, especially when reputable companies use misleading photos to swindle us out of our hard earned money. And for the record, if there was a way to rate this less than one star, I would rate it a negative ten."
3,Too Expensive...,I paid almost $20 for these as a Christmas refill present. I thought there would be alot more Gumballs than there were. I felt ripped off after I bought it.
1,Not much flavor,"The label on the packaging says ""8 fruitastic flavors"" but there aren't any fruit flavors here. The initial (very) subtle flavor of the colored shell is gone after just a few bites, and then all that's left is the generic ""gum"" flavor.Every piece literally just tastes like confectioners sugar. No flavor variation at all. If you want fruity, check out a different brand."
2,Double Bubble gum.,I hated this bubble gum. It did not hold the flavor for more than a few seconds. It also hurt my jaw as it is so hard to chew. I will not be purchasing this again.
2,Disappointing!,"I bought this to refill my kids' gumball machine. I realized when I received it, that it was the really small gumballs. I thought I could make it work, but even the entire container wouldn't have filled up the machine. The top of the gumball package was just air and a lot of the color had chipped off of the gumballs... I ended up just donating it to our church Christmas gift drive. Hopefully it will work for someone that has a much smaller toy gumball machine. Our is more commercial-rated and takes the larger gumballs."
2,Disappointment,I felt that this was a pretty poor reproduction of the book. I knew that it was not an original but the type was very small and it looked very cheap.
5,Bought these for my 2005 Honda Accord EX (inline-4 engine),"Alright, so my reviews are starting to sound similar, but that's because I decided to replace all my brake pads and rotors (front and back). As with the the Akebono ACT914 ProACT Ultra-Premium Ceramic Brake Pad Set, these fit on my car perfectly. I ran into no issues when installing these. My brake power has increased enough to make my old brakes feel as if I was driving a car from the 1970's (no offense to old cars). All in all, I approve of my new set up (Akebono ACT914 up front, Akebono ACT537 rear, and new centric rotors all around)."
5,Great brakes,"Brand new in box, Got them quickly, they installed easily (by my husband) and they were all that I expected. Thanks!"
5,Deep Space Planet Future Gun Action!,"""Deep Space Planet Future Gun Action!"" is what the book promises and what it most certainly delivers. This is the second collection of Mangas so you're going to want to pick up the first book first or you'll be a bit lost. Follow the adventures of Vash the Stampede, a seven foot tall aryan humanoid typhoon as he attempts to pursue love and peace and ends up attracting a lot of trouble. Why does trouble always find him? You'll find out if you read this manga collection. For those who are fans of the anime this Manga is different especially in what happens at the ""fifth moon"" incident. The art work is superb and the translation is very good. Highly recommended."
4,A very exciting manga,"When I picked up the first Trigun, the plot was a bit slow. I felt like I had to push myself to get through it...but now I've come to the second Trigun, and the story is so much faster! It is very climactic, and I was rushing through each page to see what would happen next. The illustrations are beautiful. Some of the characters seem (to me) to be drawn a bit similar to that of a shoujo manga artist, which is a nice change from being crudely drawn...The few comical moments are appropriate for the situation and made me laugh. Some of the more intense battle scenes confused me a bit. With a large amount of detail, it was very hard to see what was going on. In a few instances, I was only able to tell what was happening because I had watched the anime.All in all, a very good manga. Please don't buy this for a youngster. It'll scare them."
3,scattered and distant,"this book suffers from an excess of professionalism: as a successful fashion photographer, baptiste has adapted too well to the demands of shooting for the editorial, and the models shown here are much too practiced in looking pretty on cue. the result is a variety of photo techniques that don't seem especially keyed to the human themes in the photos, and a variety of models who do not communicate any intimacy because they are all so obviously *posed*. helmut newtson is an obvious yet undigested influence, and any newtson collection completely surpasses the emotional impact of this book."
3,Not so very intimate,"Being a female photographer I am very keen on the word ""intimate"" and its relationship to women posing nude. Nude photography must be intimate and carefully done with as much sensitivity as possible. I find Marc's work to be a tad unnatural and not very intimate. I guess if it was not titled as such I could look at it with a different frame of mind!"
3,oK,"It's ok, there are some great shots, but also some so so shots. I was hoping for more and better produced shots, but did not get that. I would not buy it again."
1,Call in................ The hit man,"This movie is the worst movie ever made! I hated it. I had to watch it in school last year, and I laughed at it the whole time. I did , however learn one thing from it: if you are ever being pursued by crazy axe wielding maniacs, it is safe to be in the car with Stalone. You will not be injured even if the car flips over 17 times. Oh yeah, and 1 person can take on an army, because they always wait to strike...."
3,Brigitte and some great action. What more do you need.,I always enjoy watching this for about 20 minutes at a time. But after that it starts to get a little bit boring. And it doesn't matter at which point you come into the film. It has some very funny lines and plenty of macho for those of us who like that but after the initial viewing the film loses some of it's appeal.A souped up cruiser. A renegade cop. Some square policemen. Throw in a few bad guys and a pretty girl you've got most of the films made for guys in the last 20 years.So it's definitely enjoyable but not all that great.
2,A very bad movie,There really is not any redeeming factors in the movie. The acting is simple terrible! The story is only average but it is poorly told. Like many bad movies the only thing it is worth watching for is a good laugh.If you like Stallone stay away you will be terribly disappionted. Sly as many movies that are leaps and bonds better than this thing.
1,Should be no stars,"I saw this movie when I was 16 years old and even at that tender age knew the film was a disaster of a movie. Stallone's career really went down from this point onwards until the excellent Cop Land.I must admit, however, I liked the car Cobretti drove (and subsequently trashed). Hard to believe this dross was based on a novel and Stallone actually bought to turn into a screenplay. Hmmmmmmmmmmm."
4,"""You're a disease, and I'm the cure.""",Great action film with slasher film tendancies. Stallone is almost as cool and calm under pressure as Steve McQueen or Chow Yun-Fat in this film. The only reason why it didn't get five stars was because of the major flaw in the chase scene--those of you who have seen it know what I'm talking about.
4,Soylent Dick Says: Exhilerating!,"This movie goes against everything I believe in. Yet after watching it in the theatre, I came out feeling GREAT!The most memorable quote is from Sylvester himself, to one of the bad guys:""You're the disease. I'm the cure!"""
3,"""I don't deal with psychos, I put them away!""","This time Sylvester Stallone is against a bunch of ax wielding serial killers, with nylons over their faces, who terrorize the LA nights...When a fashion model happens to see the ugly face of a sadistic psychopath (Brian Thompson), Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen) becomes the main target of the secret ""New World"" society stopping at nothing to slain her...Lieutenant Marion Cobretti (Stallone), in his gun metal-gray classic Mercury, and armed with guns, knives, grenades, and firearms, is assigned to protect the statuesque blonde...The movie is too violent and too bloody and contains one of the most interesting car chase sequences ever filmed..."
1,Vicious and violent.,"Considering Sylvester Stallone thinks guns should be banned for citizens of the US, I don't understand how he could allow himself to be in such a film that glorifies violence, killing and mayhem. This film should be banned."
1,Disappointing because it could have been so good,"Stallone plays a rogue cop on the trail of a serial killer, which could have presented us with a gripping adventure, but too much is left unclear. The villains seem to belong to some sort of neo-nazi or white supremacy group, but their motivations are never explored. Why are they killing people? What do they expect to gain? Why aren't they making demands of the cops? The whole movie is just an excuse for Stallone to rack up the body count. Terribly disappointing since Sly IS a good actor and can do so much better. Rent the Rambo or Rocky series instead"
1,"Is there a plot to this movie? ""Yeah, but it's just a little one.""","As if ROCKY IV wasn't horrible enough!If Sylvester Stallone was so desperate to play an action cop again, I would have preferred a sequel to NIGHTHAWKS, a great New York City cop movie!"
3,Snake is the Name,"Sly manages to parody himself in this over the top cop horror drama that concerns a cult gang that hangs around sewers and clinks axes all day. Sly plays a runaway, foul mouthed and rule breaking cop who says, ""If a thug aint dead, he aint worth living"". Make sense of that if you can. It's especially funny to watch Nielson pass off as a credible actress, she was awful in everything else she did, why not here? Yup, you guessed it, bad too! If you get over the tag line then you can savor this for it's rather absurd moments, Sly chewing on a match for one."
3,Cobra?Adder maybe!,"This isn't a good film,it isnt a bad film either though.It's another example of a studio releasing a bad movie with a big star in it,and hoping no one will notice how poor it is.The plot is average,and the acting isn't great.Stallone is the only thing that makes this film worth watching.With some good one liners and some good fight sequences,it's worth watching if you're a stallone fan,if not,look elsewhere."
3,Last of its kind,"""Cobra"" is an interesting movie in that it shows just how much movies have changed over the past fifteen years. I don't think a studio would put out a movie like this today. Special effects have altered the action movie landscape forever. And the storylines have changed, too. You wouldn't see a movie where a bunch of zombie-like killers stalking the streets makes up the main plot. Thus, ""Cobra"" is the last of its kind. Stallone does a decent job, but this film marked a slowdown in his career (it came out right after his 1985 hit ""Rambo II""). It wasn't until the mid-90s that he began to revitalize his career with ""Cliffhanger"" and ""Judge Dredd"" (pretty good movies, in my opinion)."
5,THE INFAMOUS..............,"This movie is real cool.Stallone aint to PAk cuz he breaks the rules and goes after the killer.THe suspense is good, but what makes this so good is it's hilariously stupid!"
1,TERRIBLE SCREENPLAY,"What makes me sad is Stallon,e being someone who fought so hard to get success and a screenwriter himself (""ROCKY"") certainly knows when he is shooting a lousy script. But he goes for it anyway, giving us this terrible motion-picture, whre there's a gang of killers who wants a new order for something..A mere vehicle for actres Brigitte Nielses, I guess.."
1,Are you kidding me?,Apparently there is some way to be paid for writing a review here on Amazon. How else could Cobra receive so many four and five star reviews? This movie is a POS. Period. End of story.
2,Not very good.,"Cobra was basically a poorly written, badly acted movie that was successful with audiences only because it was riding the popularity shock wave created by Rambo First Blood Part II. If you don't require a lot from movies to be entertaining, well then its a good flick. The characters have no depth, and what you get is a shabby job of roughemup action Styallone style against ridiculous odds. Stallone's shootemups with the bad guys are really ridiculous, as is the part when he impales the villain on a very blunt, and obviously dull hook at the local foundry. The hand to hand action, although brief was the most exciting part of this film and I wish I had seen more of that. The picture quality was not what I have come to expect from DVDs and the sound was substandard."
3,Cobra muerde!,"""Cobra"" es una pelicula de acción para el lucimiento de Stallone, como una especie de rambo urbano.Si bien la trama es sencilla, la pelicula avanza a punta de balazos, y en eso cumple bien.Despues de tanta secuelas como ""Rocky Balboa"", ""John Rambo"" y...¿ se animará para Cobra 2? Por mientras, ve esta para pasar un buen rato."
4,"""Good 80's Action Thriller!""","Sylvester Stallone and Brigitte Nielsen star in this 1986 actionthriller. A rebel cop protects a model from a killer and his gang.Sly is great in this as usual and this dvd has good picture andsound plus commentary, a featurette and trailers. I recommendthis good 80's flick."
1,What a piece of crap,"Sometimes a movie is so bad it's good. From reading the other reviews, I thought that would be the case here. It's not. This movie is about an army of psychopathic killers on motorcycles and a bunch of stupid boring car crashes enhanced by fireworks. What junk."
1,This is the kind of garbage that sunk Stallone's career,"The ""plot"" of this massive disaster is simple: Stallone's Detective Cobretti must track down an army of serial killers before they track down and kill witness/girlfriend Brigette Nielsen. After several dozen murders, Stallone tracks the killers down and blows them all away (except for the one he hangs on a hook and burns to death). The End.Total Recall showed how extreme violence could be used to produce an imaginative, entertaining film. Cobra shows how extreme violence can be used to produce a multi-million dollar mess that makes you wonder if Darwin was wrong. It's basically a star vehicle slasher film during which victim after hapless victim is paraded in front of the screen to be slaughtered in the name of forwarding the ""plot.""With a resume filled with junk like this over the past two decades, it's no wonder Stallone's career has gone down the toilet."
1,When are we going to see a definitive DVD edition of Cobra?,"To many people (including myself) Cobra is a classic film and as such deserves an appropriate DVD release. This ""bare bones"" release has been around for well over 4 years.Come on Warner Bros where's the definitive DVD edition?"
5,Get this DVD!,"While the film is typical 1980s right-wing nonsense, the director commentary featured on the DVD is beyond hilarious. Most of the time, the commentary on special editions is insightful or even fascinating, but this time around, the director seems so bored he is reduced to commenting on the Christmas decarations and Pepsi machines. However, if you must watch the film, I submit that the ""romance"" between Stallone and Nielsen is one of the worst ever captured on screen. Also, take note of the massive photo of then-President Reagan on the wall in the cop station.......need I say more?"
4,Psycho?,"A ""get what you pay for"" Dirty Harry clone in which Sly tosses out a few too many tough guy one-liners, basically. Perhaps I'm over-analyzing the thing, but watch closely as buttoned-down Andrew Robinson, best known for his ""Scorpio"" serial sniper in Clint's original vigilante cop hit referenced above, has a moment when, after being accosted by Sly's Cobretti, snarls, ""HE'S the psycho!!"" A clever intentional line? who knows? lol"
3,A piece of entertainment,"This movie lingers between the lines of being the worst movie ever made, and the funniest.Don't get me wrong on this, the film is crap, no dought about it, the film is crap, but it will have you in hysterics from beginning to end. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense but you don't really care, it's full of some of the stupidest things I've ever seen (Like when the bad guy dies his hair black. Like it really makes any difference to a guy as hefty as that.He looked exactly the same.)Basically you can't go on about it for too long but it's worth renting if your looking for a comedy that will really make you laugh out loud.Saying that I would love to see the directors commentary. He might be as funny as the film itself?"
1,I would give this a big 0 if I could!,"This movie was Stallone's worst. It was cheesy, the acting was terrible & the effects even at the time were just bad. Stallone is not one of my favorites, but even Cop Land was better than this excuse for a movie! Stockard Channing really must have been desperate to be in this thing. To go from Grease to Cobra is real doward spiral. Cobra should have been on MST3K as bad as it is."
4,Clymer Yamaha YZ125-250 1988-1993 WR250Z 1991-1993,"Excellent service, repair, and maintenance manual. It contains useful illustrations, diagrams, tables and detailed installation/removal instructions. The only thing this manual lacks is the OEM part number for each component."
5,everything you could want to know about your 250~~,"As per usual, Clymer has come through again with an excellent book. We are resurecting a long neglected cycle and this book has been invaluable! Thanks for always doing us right Clymer! I can not wait until my little Midnight is out on the road!"
4,"Worth the Read, for Beginners Too","Although Joan won an Olympic medal and I've only run two 5k races, I found this book to be very useful and informative. Some of the training drills are new to me, most actually, and I plan on using them. She also has a training schedule for everything from your first 10k to your first marathon. The book even touches on 5k races and the mile. I don't know that I'll ever want to train for a marathon, but the book was interesting and inspiring, with Joan's personal experiences mixed in with experts's advice on everything from stretching to buying the right bra."
2,a disappointment,"Unfortunately, Samuelson's writing skills are far less inspiring that her gold medal win of the first women's Olympic marathon. Her co-writer does little to add clarity and excitment to the work and, instead, just muddies the waters further (the two of them continually alternate writing, switching from the first to third person with no clear segues). Even the information it delivers is old news (advice such as: ibuprofen relieves menstrul cramps). There are so many better instructional books about running."
3,A very personal project for the artist,"This CD was a very personal project for the artist in her attempts to reach her neice who apparently has some challenges. It is very interesting, but doesn't keep my attention the way some of her others do. I still prize owning it, as I will anything she records."
2,How the hell do you put that plastic thingy on,"I purchased this crate for a ferret. I like the fact that it is made of sturdy plastic, which is great because my ferret enjoys ripping apart the fabric ones ( which is dangerous because he can escape). It locks securely and has a convenient over the shoulder strap. The tiny compartment at the top is big enough for a small Ziploc bag of food. The food/water dish is sturdy, but I wish there were 2 included. The only downfall is that terribly ill fitting plastic part at the top. I never found out how to put it correctly. Even when it seemed to fit, something was off.There was too much space left (which is dangerous, again because he can escape) ,so i ended up taping it up on an emergency vet visit. It has remained unattractively taped up. I am currently looking for another travel crate. Save yourself the headache."
5,Just what we needed,"Bought these when changing legs on some chairs, they worked great, arrived on time. Easy to use and a good product."
4,Great license plate frame,"I'm a big Giants fan and this frame shows it on my new truck. The quality is very good, so I have no complaints, unlike the cheap one I bought with it that says ""TUNDRA"" with burnished stickers."
5,How to make MLM work for you,"Although Mr. Pinnock is mainly speaking about his MLM company, ""Reliv"", I feel that if you follow his merthod you will be succwessful in any MLM you try.Mr. Pinnock makes everything very clear for the beginner and is tips are a help for the seasoned MLMer."
5,Wonderful book,This is a very interesting book. Easy and quick to read. You will learn a lot and laugh a lot as you are reading it.
4,Avid Reader re the Middle East,The book reflects what I consider a pretty honest appraisal of the truth regarding the Palestinian situation. The author states salient comments not heard in any of the media.It highlights the deplorable actions by the U.S. in mediating the situation. My opinion is that the book is very insightful and the facts are well presented.Jim
2,Polemic instead of history,"Long ago academic historians were supposed to be objective, but rigorous methodology and balanced analysis apparently have been abandoned to partisanship and show-boating. Certainly rigor and fairness seem to be forgotten in this slanted account of Middle Eastern history. Khalidi is not a bad writer, but he is not a good historian in my humble opinion."
1,"Slanted, biased and typically anti-American","A hard book to read without laughing out loud at the absurd assumption that he makes about an ""American Empire"". No where does he have a shred of proof of that, but a fabrication repeated over and over seems to be the truth to many in the Middle East. As a college librarian I am well read in this area. His astoundingly partisan views of what is really happening in Iraq and with Israel makes this book useless if you want to understand the Middle East."
5,Quilting Projects,"Many different patterns and templates for quilting - 12 patchwork quilts, 4 appliqued quilts, 4 crib quilts, 6 banners or pictures, 6 pillows, 8 small things, and 4 pieces of clothing, in addition to general directions, applique techniques, and stitch details."
3,"Too detailed of questions, but the explanations atone for it","Although the questions sometimes get too detailed for purposes of Step 2 - type exams, the explanations are excellent and tend to cover more basic facts. This atones for the occasional question that states, ""current research states ..."" and puts it in the grasp of most medical students. This is a good book to cover (or at least sample) if you are taking NBMLE shelf exams."
2,Most disappointing of PreTest books I have used,"In brief, I used the Ob-Gyn, Psychiatry, and Peds pre-tests for my shelf exams. Thus, I picked up a copy of this book to study for my surgery shelf. I was very disappointed.Problems:-This book beyond the level of a third- or fourth-year medical student. The questions are too detailed and esoteric. I think even a surgical intern or resident would have a hard time with these questions.-Many of the explanations are convoluted, and there is no clear cut answer given in the actual explanation. I will echo the sentiment that the explanations seem contradictory, and you are often left wondering, ""Why is my answer wrong then?"" after reading an explanation.I advise using the other PreTest books, but clearly this text is not worth your time."
2,It's okay,"This book does have some nice pictures, but I don't like the way some of the animals are named, for example calf instead of cow, kitten instead of cat.... I think very young children find it easier to say cat, cow instead of kitten and calf. There were too many of these types of identifiying names. I'd stick with a book that has the basic names and work from there as my child gets older."
4,Cute book,"My baby really likes this book. My only wish is that the animals written names were consistent with the adult animal name (there is a kitten, a calf, some chicks, etc.) It really isn't a big deal, seeing as how he can't read and by the time he can read he will understand that babies are referred to by different names than adults. Overall, the pictures are nice, colors are vibrant, a great book."
4,Chuzzle Game,Everyone in my family loves this game. It is easy to play but still challenging. The shipping was a bit expensive but the game is a blast.
1,rip off,"What i got was a CD that lets me play a timed game, and tells me I can pay for it again to own it (6.95). With the shipping I paid 18.88. There is no registration number, and no way to install it. I could have done this myself online and paid 6.95. It is a shame Amazon supports the seller."
1,WHA?????,BUYING 1-7 Is only 100 bucks more and it comes with twice the episodes this does. AND ALSO IF YOU BUY THEM SEPRTELY IT COSTS LESS!
2,A Better Deal?,"What exactly are we getting for an extra 55 Bucks? If you buy them seperately, it's about $295. And the set is over $350? That must be some great packaging, since seperately the case is far less superior than the two other series. (DS9 and TNG). The show and extras are definitely a must have, but for this kind of money, I want to eat my cake too."
4,The Best Star Trek Series,I agree that Star Trek Voyager is by far the most superior of the Star Trek series. The quality of acting as well as character development is superior. The conflict struggles and interpersonal relationships mirror todays conflicts.
5,Interesting concept,"In my opinion they should of did this with DS9 and TNG. Voyager, in my opinion, is one of the better Star trek incarnations and by releasing the sets like this not only will you save a couple of bucks but you will have the best seasons ever made."
5,A riveting novel set in the modern day,"The Immensity Of The Here And Now by Paul West is a riveting novel set in the modern day during the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. The Immensity Of The Here And Now is the story of two men, one who lost his memory and the other being war-wounded therapist who tries to help him yet is slowly losing his own hold on life, The Immensity Of The Here And Now is profound, disturbing, and a compelling inner study of picking up the pieces in the wake of personal devastation."
3,Satisfactory,"Its very small and weak, But does the job and is very efficient. Perfect for hanging things in a dorm....no mess, no screws."
1,Waste of money,"This rod is one that you twist to a little longer than the correct length and then compress into the space. I twisted but when I compressed it to fit, it just pushed all the way together. There is no way that this can hold up anything -- not even itself. I have bought the same type from Walmart and was completely happy with them (used the same ones for years!). Guess I will go to WalMart because this one is in the trash!!!!"
3,Flimsy re strength and manufacture,Perhaps would do for very light weight use but if you need solidity stay away. Not worthy of Levolor name.
4,GOOD ALBUM,"THIS ALBUM GOT THE ATMOSPHERE OF TINY MUSIC, YOU CAN HEAR LOTS OF INFLUENCES FROM THE BEATLES, THE SINGER IS NOT AS GOOD AS SCOTT(ONE OF THE BEST LEADSINGERS OF ALL TIMES) BUT HE'S NOT BAD."
2,The sum equaled more than each part put together.,"Let's face it. When STP was together, each member brought out something new in each other. Standing alone, these two halfs of a band are just that - incomplete. I think Talk Show is the weaker of these two halfs; an irony considering the band includes more members of STP.Weiland's new album is great, maybe it did him some good to get a new perspective on music. Still it lacks the intricacies that the De'Leo brothers offered.Guys if you're out there, give it one more shot. Your fans need you."
2,What the hell?,"Man , what the hell where this guys thinking when they decided to put this kind of a record in the stores , it's a total waist of money and listening time , if you like stp you won't like this at all , almost all the songs are terrible and with no creativity , please cut the crap and let stp do their work"
3,Quite a departure for Kretz and the brothers DeLeo,"I recently bought this CD, and while Dave Coutts is no Scott Weiland, he holds his own quite well. The best songs are ""Fill the Fields,"" ""Wash Me Down"" and ""Hide."" The album seems much more mellow than most of STP's work. Overall, a worthwhile effort."
4,Under-appreciated sparkly pop rock album,"An outstanding jangle-pop meets hard rock record. To be sure, this isn't Core or No. 4; there aren't really any titanic guitar riffs here (nothing like ""Down"" or ""Sex Type Thing."") This album is overflowing with melody, harmony and guitar-based hooks. One thing STP does so well -- always has, always will (see: Army of Anyone & latest STP record) -- is arrange songs. It's like an orchestra of guitar and bass tones and tracks on these songs. Dave Coutts' voice sits wonderfully in the songs, which are propelled by the tight Motown-like grooves of the Kretz/DeLeo machine. The middle kind of gets murky and unfocused, but that's a minor complaint. Favorite songs: Hello Hello, Morning Girl, Everybody Loves My Car."
3,Not Bad,"Not a bad CD. I saw them play a couple years ago. They were the opener for Foo Fighters at Memorial in Kansas City. Nothing like seeing members of STP followed by members of Nirvana...lol. They played a few STP songs such as Plush and Interstate Love Song. Overall this CD isn't bad, just not as good as the STP material."
4,this is a pretty good cd,"i really liked this cd.I have heard alot of people say that this cd was not good, but i would have to disagree.If you are a fan of stp then you will like this album.It sounds like stp in so many ways.I think alot of people are putting it down just because scott weiland was not in this recording"
3,Natural Progression,"There is something about the music of STP that sets them apart from other heavy pop bands. Although there is plenty of edge and grind to the guitar work of the De Leo brothers, a certain psychedelic dreamyness is woven into the music. This quality is also manifest in the vocal content. What otherwise might be depressingly mainstream becomes mature, interesting listening. There is no lack of this in the post-Weiland efforts of STP, now known as Talk Show. This is a good album from start to finish. It is very ""STP like"" and actually feels like a natural progression from TINY MUSIC. The relevance of Weiland to the STP sound may not be as weighty as some think. I should have picked up this CD a long time ago. * * * 1/2 TS"
3,....,"although it is no comparasin to stp, it definitly shows creativity and musicianship.. it's a little different without scott, but in a whole it lived up to expectations"
5,Very interesting book,"Although this book is all about Shutzhund, I think it has a lot of practical applications to normal, everyday dogs as well. The authors went into a lot of detail about how to make training fun for the dog, and how to keep it fun. Very worthwhile book to anyone who thinks there's no place for positive reinforcement in a such a difficult sport.The authors highlighted when it is ok to use corrections, and when there is no place for it, while also leaving it up to the reader whether they incorporate it into their training or not.Overall, a very worthwhile read!"
1,What's with the cover?,"I was excited seeing the cover of this album, because it boasts the logo of legendary, although to this day unrecorded and hard to discover, 70s punk band the screamers. I thought that maybe some company had come to their senses and put out the demos that they had recorded. No such luck. Just some 70s crap. Music industry, there are plenty of logos in the world, don't use one band's logo to promote another type of music."
4,The 70's Revisited,Some of the best and biggest names from the 70's come together in this wondeful collection. The only pitfall being that the audio quality of almost every track suffers from the equipment limitations of the time. Highly recommened for those who can't get enough of those 70's sounds.
3,Not that great,"One of the biggest dissapointments on this CD is they had to edit out the guitar solo at the end of Black Sabbath's Iron Man and edit out the 'New Mother Nature' part of Guess Who's No Time and I think that they've could chose a better selection of songs and bands like Starz: Boys in Action, Kiss: Rock 'n' Roll All Nite, Aerosmith: Walk This Way, Mama Kin or Last Child, Deep Purple: Woman From Tokyo, Rainbow: Man on the Silver Mountain or Long Live Rock 'n' Roll, UFO: Lights Out or Mother Mary and Journey: Wheel in the Sky.Overall if you like 70's classic rock then you'll like this CD."
4,several hits on one CD,"This CD has several very popular songs in the original versions. If you see several songs you like, it is definitely worth getting, as it will save you a lot of time and money finding the songs on individual CDs. The sound quality is good. There are no notes or information other than the names of the songs and artists.I looked for this CD here because I wanted to get some of the other volumes in the set and I couldn't find them anywhere."
2,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly","Recognizing the limited availability of video adequately covering Costa Rica this DVD may meet your needs, but potential purchasers should be aware of the following:1.) While the DVD release date or copyright in 2006 may imply recent release this does not accurately reflect the production date. Actual footage is of older vintage. That is not to say that the content is not a decent quality. However, be aware this title may be a bit outdated.2.) These DVD's are duplicated on DVD-R media and are NOT compatible with all DVD players in all regions. To avoid a DVD that does not play correctly (or at all) verify any intended player is capable of handling DVD-R media before ordering.3.) Lift up your senses. Quick investigation of all reviews provided by Rocky Mountain ""Lisa"" on March 3, 2006 will reveal an identical voice of enthusiastic approval for all LMXMEDIA releases available through Amazon at the time of this review."
1,Zero Star Rating,It's too bad there isn't a zero star rating. This DVD doesn't work. There is no sound and you can't leave the main menu. I explored the DVD with my computer and discovered that in the audio folder there are no files. A big disappointment since its advertisement makes it seem just right for my interests in Costa Rica.
5,Great Costa Rica Video,Very good overview of Costa Rica Parks and Wildlife. Nothing much about the people but great narration by John Forsythe. I have watched this over and over. I absolutely love this country.
5,This Book was a favorite.,My Granddaughter absolutely loves this book. She's 17 months old and enjoys anything Barney. Baby Bop's purse is especially entertaining. Great fun for both of us.
5,Very helpful!,It took me a while to decide what book to buy regarding prophecy. So many out there! and when you are a beginner is hard to discern which one is best for you.This book is not complicated. It is well detailed and helpful if you are trying to figuring out how to deal with your prophetic gifts. It's a good start and a good reference guide when the time of leading prophetic groups comes.
4,A new edition of this book is out!,"There's a new edition of this title.I checked with the new one, there are some revisions (changing to different chapters and adding new insights and teachings by Mike).I'd get the new one as the revelation is very important in growing in the prophetic.Throughout the years, IHOP as a whole learn much new revelation of what the Holy Spirit wants to teach the church and the body of Christ. I treasure how they teach you as someone who desires to grow in the prophetic must be humble and use it for edifying the church.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about prophetic gifts and how to exercise your gifts."
4,New Birth Order Book,"What a fun and well-researched book! Leman explores our reactions to life according to how life was presented to us--that is, according to our places in our families. Without pointing fingers, Leman explains a lot about your personality, without ever having met you!"
1,Poorly written; author shares his amazing biases proudly,"Kevin Leman is a poor writer. The subject is fascinating but Leman seems to think that readers should believe what he says just because he says it. He gives scant attention to well-replicated studies on the subject.As an example of his pronouncements, in discussing firstborn newscasters and talk-show hosts, he writes ""and the spokesman for excellence in broadcasting himself, Rush Limbaugh"". ... I wish his biases were clearer before I put out money for this unhelpful book."
3,"Birth Order Book, The: Why You Are the Way You Are",I have heard of this book which was the reason I purchased it. I have not yet read it. I am number six out of six girls and I cannot wait to see each of us in the book. I am sure I will recognize the personality.
5,Worth Reading.,I bought this for my daughter-in-law and ended up reading part of it before I gave it to her. It fit my children to a T. This book was right on the spot with my children.
3,"Good info, but wordy, can skim through a lot","I like the concepts presented here and it helps in understanding the different personalities of my children, but the author is wordy and I do skim through a lot of each paragraph"
3,A let-down,"I purchased this book because I wanted to understand more about my birth order (2nd born/last of two). I quickly found myself frustrated with the first chapters because the focus seemed to be on the first born.Also, Dr. Leman spends way too much time in most chapters talking about himself, his childhood, his kids, etc. He tries to explain his theories through hypothetical family breakdowns (none of which fit my own!) instead of giving statistics and probability figures.The most useful pieces of the book are the ""trait"" diagrams for firstborn, middle, and last born personality types that show strengths and weaknesses. Also, he has a good chapter to help perfectionists deal with extremes and understand that excellence is a more attainable goal."
4,Insightful and Interesting,"There is some great research and useful insight in this book. There are many variables that can make someone's birth order more of a ""birth order"" (which the author does address) but there are fascinating ways of quickly determining where someone is coming from during a conversation (or within a relationship in general), and how you can adjust the conversation to meet both of your needs. Particularly interesting for partner relationships and business colleagues. Worth the read, just don't expect an iron-clad rigid predictor of personality types."
5,Fascinating!,This book amazed me over and over. It seemed that Dr. Leman had a window into my life! It really helped me be more aware of mine and my husband's perfectionist tendencies and how much pressure it can be on our first born already perfectionist 5 year old.
5,The Birth Order Book,"I really enjoyed this book. It is very easy to read and you can just look around your own friends or family to see the ""truth in the application"">"
5,Excellent!!!,This book is very helpful in understanding why I do what I do and why others do what they do. Very informative and has helped change me in the way I think about situations and respond as well. Highly recommend this book. Dr. Kevin Leman also adds much humor to keep things light.
3,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book. From everyone's reviews, it seemed like a fun and interesting read. It wasn't. Sure, there are interesting facts and funny stories about birth order, but it seems like every other paragraph is either about God (which, at times, can start to sound preachy), or about the author himself (how smart he is) and his flawless family (wife, kids, sisters, brothers). I wish the author spent more time talking about actual facts and statistics regarding birth order instead of constantly talking about how, as little kids, his older sister would invite him to tea parties, how selfless she is, or how his son will one day design futuristic rides for Disney World. You get the feeling the author thinks really highly of himself and his family. It gets annoying and gets in the way of any factual information he might be trying to convey."
3,Too long,"I found this book helpful but a lot of things won't apply. Everyone is different. The birth order didn't work in my family when I was growing up, and it doesn't really work with my own family now.Some things speak to the core but many don't. But it's great to know to which birth order a person applies more, forgetting a real birth order all together.This book could be made shorter. It was overwritten but a pleasant read."
5,The Best Album EVER!!,"This is the absolute best album ever, when I heard one of the songs, the next day I went out and bought the album, and to this day it is my favorite!! Go get it if you like really different stuff!!"
4,Transmission,"This album is truly a treat. It deals with the ""funkier"" side of the Tea Party, with guitars and drums galore. ""Transmission"" in my opinion is a summary of all the past albums that The Tea Party have produced, with a twist. Saying that however, at times it does get a bit too excessive. The message Martin wants to express is quite clear: Live and let live or wither and die. Listen to this album and get ready for a real ride, a ride which has no speed limit nor blasting horns wailing at you, except perhaps the sound of those blasted drums."
5,Tea-rrific!,"Absolutely marvelous CD! The Tea Party have consistantly put out a fine line of rocking, sensual, heavily melodic albums, and this is no exception. Though not *quite* as diverse with different world instruments as say, The Edges of Twilight, this CD definitely will keep you attention. Jeff Martin's deep velvet voice shows a bit more variety than previous albums (and even more variety on their next album, TRIPtych!. Jeff B's gives his drums quite a workout, and Stu gives a great example of his bass and keyboard abilities. The philosophical lyrics are interesting to listen to and interpret as well. Highly recommended!"
5,"Intense, emotional, passionate! no does it better!",". The Tea Party does it once again! another amazing cd! A look into Jeff martins amazing song writing ability. Very intense and passionatly written. The hidden keyboard sounds by stuart, the emotional drum playing by Jeff Burrows, and the intense lyrics sung by the one and only jeff Martin all intertwines to make this in my opinion there best cd yet! althought there may be more feelings and memories we do not understand,The Tea Party has put a year and a half into this cd, and all has paid off!,It is my favorite cd ever! congrats !!!!!!"
1,The poorest of the poor,"This album is sad. I bought it yesterday, listened to it last night, and I'm selling it today. What makes this album so disappointing is that I thoroughly enjoyed their first two albums, and now they've come out with this.The lyrics are poor, most of the melodies are ripped straight from their previous albums, their characteristic eastern tinge to their music is overstated, and there is absolutlely none of the wonderful mix of music styles that made their first two albums stand out. And DON'T get me started about their fake-sounding, totally misguided attempt to incorporate the use of a drum machine into their songs. Tea Party does drum'n'bass? I don't think so.Do yourself a favor -- listen before you buy. I wish I had. Better yet, don't buy at all."
3,Frightening.,"A good rock band is supposed to have range. Take Savage Garden: they can play romantic songs, hip hop tunes and hard rock. But all The Tea Party can do is (very) hard rock, which they do well. They tried to be slightly romantic on a couple songs, and it just didn't work. It came out more frightening. It they worked on their range (and let the backups sing more) they'd be a great band."
1,Why bother?,"This album is very poor. The lyrics are apalling throughout the album, though ""Release"" is by far the worst offender. The melody is good, but there is very little melodic variation between songs. More annoying than this is the similarity of some of the tunes with songs by other artists. The electronic noises used in the songs are unwelcome, and prove that ""clever"" production can never make up for boring songwriting. Musicianship is ordinary, but again it is the dreadful lyrics that make this album so unlistenable. Standout tracks include Emerald and Army Ants."
5,Right Behind EOT,"This is easily the group's darkest effort, driven still by industrial guitars, but also surrounded by brooding rhythms. Worth picking up to see what happens when EOT goes on downers and gets heartbroken simultaneously."
3,Pretty good album,"I was once a fan of this kind of music, I am not anymore, those bands often pass just like clouds, but Tea Party is different and remains in the best of its genre and I still like their albums. The music is intelligent and the melodies are catchy most of the time."
3,Almost a 4 star cd.,"Good effort from these guys. Led Zeppelin smothered with electric middle eastern seasonings. Better than Triptych, but not as good Edges of Twilight."
3,Depends on what you are looking for,I prefer a book that's more illustrated and an easier read. If you are looking for a comprehensive text on Greek mythology this is a good set but if you are just looking to read for entertainment this set is a little too in depth.
3,Only a Tidbit,"As the author stated, this book does not fulfill it's title's promise. It is a mere shadow, a tidbit of what is involved in spherical astronomy. Reading it can either fire your imagination to learn more, or make you want to get a computer program and just 'punch in the numbers'"
5,Makes a good CPU fan replacement,"When one of the two CPU fans in my server started dying I was forced to look for a replacement. I didn't want to replace the entire CPU fan as the Thermaltake Silent Boost for Opteron heatsinks worked very well, their fans were just designed poorly and tend to fail frequently. So I hunted up the specs and found that they use 92mm fans, so I hunted up these Vantecs, because when I previously purchased some 120mm Vantec Stealth fans they were incredibly quiet and I hoped the smaller version would have the same characteristics. I was not disappointed, these fans are even quieter than the Silent Boost fans I believe, and keep my server just as cool. They also have a much lower profile so I can route cables more easily and have more space around the CPUs to mount an additional fan for cooling the RAM."
3,Mostly reliable,"Quiet and cheap with decent airflow. That's the case fan trifecta! I've used Vantec Stealth fans before and found them to be very reliable. This batch was a bit disappointing, however. Purchased three fans and after four months of 24x7 use in my file server, one of the fans is already starting to go bad. It's still spinning, but making an annoying amount of noise where previously it was virtually silent. Since the server is located in the center of my office, the noise is readily apparent and the fan will need to be replaced."
2,LOUD fan...,Stealth ??? No way. This fan was more than twice as loud as my Thermaltake fan I ended up getting.
1,Vendor won't deliver,"I have tried to order this item twice, each time the vendoe cancels my order saying they won't deliver to my address. I order from Amazon all the time never had a problem with delivery before."
3,"Pretty good, but missing a few key songs","All in all I thought the cd was great, but it is missing a few ""traditional"" disco songs (Such as ""Love Hangover"" by Diana Ross, which ironically on the pop charts was #1 for 18 weeks and on the R&B charts was #1 for 17 weeks!) So if you're new to disco, this is the CD for you. In my opinion not for hard-core discoers."
3,Gene Vincent,One of Gene's poorer CD's. Most of the songs are slow waltz type. The CD does contain a few of his hits. Not one of his better CD's.
4,Sabac Meets Necro Production,"In terms of Message Sabac and Necro are like complete opposites. But sabac sure sounds good over necro production and with him on ""Pos and Neg."" Sabac is a skilled rapper and lyricist who continues on his mission with this release."
5,Very Thorough. A Must for any Blondie Fan!,"I love Blondie and I couldn't have asked for a more thorough and entertaining documentary of the group. There are in-depth interviews with the band members as recent as the No Exit album. (It is interesting to see how jittery a couple of them are, including Debbie; too much coke from the Studio 54 days?!!) The video plays many snippits of songs spanning their career, as well as showing video clips. It even covers some of their solo work, and Debbie's 1968 music venture with the group, The Wind in the Willows. I bought that album as a result of it being mentioned. You'll find the complete Maria video in this, too. This is a must-have for any Blondie fan. At this price, you'll be very satisfied!"
4,Stax/Volt Review Smokes in Norway,"You take arguably the best backup band in the country, add a hot horn section and put them behing some of the finest soul performers in the business at their peak and this is what you get - a show you wished you had seen in person. When you put Booker T & The MGs and the MarKeys behind Arthur Conley, Eddie Floyd, Sam and Dave and the incomporable Otis Redding you are in for a hot time, indeed, and this DVD - made for TV in Norway during the Stax/Volt tour of Europe in 1967 - captures that excitement. The only thing keeping it from a full 5-star rating is that it appears some of the Eddie Floyd segment has been lost for some reason and it was shot in black and white, but those are minor picks at otherwise excellent footage. Watching this DVD will let you relive the times when soul music had soul and performers gave it everything they had and provided their own pyrotechnics without the need of 22 dancers and 10 back-up singers to entertain you. This is the real thing!"
5,who is the beat werewolf?,"The title says it all. Who is that dude passed out in the aisle? I am a huge Steve Cropper fan, but I wish they had tracked down the stoned beatnik werewolf for the extras instead. Dude apparently WENT OFF!"
4,STAX/VOLT LIVE,"I ENJOYED THE PERFORMANCE,BROUGHT BACK SOME GREAT MEMORIES FOR ME...I WISH EDDIE FLOYD HAD INCLUDED ""KNOCK ON WOOD"" IN HIS PERFORMANCE,THUMBS UP TO SAM AND DAVE."
5,"If you are even considering this, just go for it.","I LOVE THIS DVD. AMAZING!If you like Stax/Volt and have never seen this concert, BUY IT NOW."
4,great capture of concert action but sound needs some work,the video is awesome and captures the live intensity (the intros in norwegian dont hurt)but the sound quality on several of the cuts just isnt good enough. Maybe its my dvd soundsytem combo ( not exactly state of the art) but i dont get that high cutout and bleary sax noise when i play amy winehouse.
1,Crackle Hiss Pop,"Terrible sound quality. After all, it is music and it is suppose to sound good but it doesn't. It must have been wonderful attending this event but the recording is like watching a 1950's TV show."
4,Track Listing ...,"Here's the track listing, from all music, for those seriously considering purchasing this set.1 Red Beans and Rice Booker T. & the MG's2 Green Onions Booker T. & the MG's3 Philly Dog Mar Keys4 Grab This Thing Mar Keys5 Last Night Mar Keys6 In the Midnight Hour Arthur Conley7 Sweet Soul Music Arthur Conley8 Raise Your Hand Eddie Floyd9 You Don't Know Like I Know Sam & Dave10 Soothe Me Sam & Dave11 When Something Is Wrong with My Baby Sam & Dave12 Hold On! I'm Comin' Sam & Dave13 Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song) Otis Redding14 My Girl Otis Redding15 Shake Otis Redding16 Satisfaction Otis Redding17 Try a Little Tenderness Otis Redding"
4,HEAVY DUTY,"Very heavy duty extention, but easy to roll and unroll. I like the lighted plug feature. It goes well with the chpper/shredder and doesn't heat up at all. I have 220 amp service, so I just plugged it in the garage outlet and all was OK."
2,Not So Hot,"The Manhattan Transfer are one of my favorite groups, and I really like most of their CDs, but this one doesn't get it together and take off like many (including their first one) do. It doesn't help matters much that it is over-produced and very poorly recorded."
3,Good... not great.,"I have been appreciative of Manhattan Transfer's contribution to music from day one of their existance. I respect any group that can sing Java Jive for 25+ years and still make it at least appear as if they enjoy singing it. However, the past few Best of... Very Best of... and now Swing with remakes of past tunes as well as new tunes that in my opinion lack the intense creativity displayed in the past--just listen to Vocalese to see what I mean--have disappointed this still loyal fan. It's good... not great. I do have to say, however, that I had second row seats to hear MT perform ""Clouds"" with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra... and that performance was delightful. Keep up the good work... sometimes LESS is MORE."
5,Great Movie!,Great ENGLISH movie. Richard Chamberlain was a great actor for this movie. The story in this movie is more realistic than the new version. I saw the new version and didn't like it because it was too Dark in most scenes and had a hard time following the story. This 1975 version is the best and I recommend this very highly!!!
4,ThecCount of monte christo,What a load of rubbish re time to write a review about how much foreign asian ius in this. I wanted NOT DER GRAF VON MONT CHRISTO BUT The count of Monte Christo. I'm a long time Collector Buyer of Amazon and not too happy. I do like the movie.
3,old version,I find this version of the COMC as best of the lot. The story line is better connected and classier.\
2,DVD has flaws,"The DVD has flaws which come on in certain parts of the movie. What procedure do you have for exchange? Thank you, Bruce R. Lamb"
3,The Count of Monte-Cristo (Der Graf von Monte Christo),"I purchased this dvd because I had previously viewed the original and thought it a worthwhile gift for the children in our family. I was displeased to note how may of what I deem to be crucial scense have been deleted.It is easy to understand how those who elected to make the film would have been compelled to eliminate much of the prose/dialog that the author included since this work was originally written as a play .. the medium then practiced at the time of its creation. Yet, it boggles my mind that the simple transfer from video to dvd should further reduce the content.I have given this product 3 stars because what remains is still a classic and a valuable learning tool for one's children. However, as a commercial product I can not endorse it for the butchery that has occurred.For those who enjoy such classics .. look elsewhere for some other product that hasn't reduced the content."
1,very poor,This video of count of monte cristo was a poor copy.I like the story but could not watch it on a poorly made video.When I tried to return it Amazon made it very dificult so my plan is to never order anything from Amazon again.You might not see this review because Amazon might cover it up.
2,Not the best,I don't like the elastic straps that attach it to the head rests. Guess I should have read all the reviews before buying.
3,Product looked ok but didn't fit,I have a hyundai elantra and the holes for the seat belt were in the wrong place and the cover looked like it was made for a wider car as it was a little big. I wish it had fit because it looked like a nice cover. I had to return it (and pay for the shipping)
3,You get what you paid for,"If you can fit it properly on the back seat then it works good. Unfortunately it does not fit the back seat of my 2 door Honda Accord properly, so when my dog is in the car and moving around then the cover will came off the seat so the seat is not properly covered. I do like it is washable and you can use it either side."
3,Flimsy Elastic....Not for Big Dogs,"This cover isn't too bad, it covers the seats ok. However, I have big dogs and with them stepping on it as they rode around, the elastic or whatever it was broke, so there was nothing to hold it up. I cut holes in the fabric and put rope through the holes to attach it to the head rest. In all other respects its a good cover for the money, but if you have big dogs you may need to replace the attachments for the head rests."
4,Does the job,We needed a cover for a rear seat in a smaller car. This did a nice job and served the purpose. Well made and stood up well. Would have liked to have more info on the head rest fasteneers before purchase though
3,Hope you don't have a sick dog,"I purchased this product with the hope of protecting my back seat from my two lab puppies.Getting this to fit on the back seat of my Nissan Altima was a bit of a struggle, but my husband and I got it in about 7 minutes.The real issue was when they got car sick. I took the seat cover out about 5 minutes after the both of them vomited on it, and it had already leaked through and left a large spot on my car seat.This will protect your car from excess hair and dirt, but if you don't have a well trained dog or one that throws-up in the car, you are better off spending more $$$ for a water resistant product."
4,Pleased in VA,"The cover fits my Ford Explorer very well, and stays in place when my English Bulldog and Standard Poodle are moving around on it. It was easily removed for washing, and washed well."
3,you get what you pay for,"There is nothing to hold the outside corners in place, it is not waterproof, and it slides around on leather; however it does keep the dogs nails from scratching the leather, and controls the pet hair. It is washable. It does seem sturdy, and is a good value for the money."
3,May experience some technical difficulties...,I was happy to see a DVD on Aikido featuring a variety of its masters (rather than Ueshiba alone). But there is a wide discrepancy in the material quality from one master to the next and the end sequences look like someone just added in their own dojo's home movies to this otherwise historic footage of the masters.
3,see next review!,I made a mistake and wrote review under Handbook! Please switch review and leave Handbook BLANK as I have not read it yet. Thanks
2,"Not rating Poetry, just Amazon's subscription scheme","My beef is with Amazon's advertising ""up to 75% off"" for subscriptions. I've checked the rates for VQR, Poetry, Writer's Digest, and Poets & writers, and I'm four for four: Amazon's rates are either exactly the same as those posted on these journals' websites, or (in the case of Writer's Digest and P&W) more expensive. It's nice, I guess, that Amazon is providing more exposure for these journals; nonetheless, for them to claim they're offering a discount, while not exactly a lie (since they're offering a discount over the per-copy price), is deceiving, as they don't seem to be offering a cheaper rate than that already offered by the journals. Caveat, as always, emptor."
3,"Meh, not bad.... Not silent",Good fans at a great pice but these are NOT silent. Overall great for my purpose but may look into better fans when these die.
3,Not so stealthy,I bought two of these fans to replace the 60mm fans in my Lanbox lite after reading a review from someone else who did the same thing. One of the stock Thermaltake fans had started to get really squeaky in its old age.Installation of the fans went fine with the included hardware. I moved the stock fan that was still functioning to the third optional exhaust fan spot in the case. The Vantec Stealth fans move more air than the stock Thermaltake fans but they are by no means quieter. The Vantec Stealths are the loudest fan in my computer. They produce as much if not more noise than the fan on my stock GPU cooler under load. They never run under 2000RPMs which is probably why they make so much noise. I'm going to undervolt the fans next time I have the case apart. That should quiet them down.
5,Great fans,"I replaced the 2 stock fans on my Lanbox Lite and added a third one above the graphics card (GTX570) because my computer kept shutting down due to overheating. Since I replaced the two stock fans and added the third one with these Stealth fans, I noticed a much better airflow and no more overheating. These are slightly more noisy than the stock but they move air much better which is what I needed."
1,Also came with wrong screws,This is a big disappointment. An earlier reviewer complained about this same issue 5 months ago. I can confirm they are still shipping fans with the wrong screws! This a waste of my time - I will return it immediately.
2,CAME WITH WRONG SCREWS,"This fan came with four screws that were too large in diameter to fit in the holes and were less than a quarter inch long when the fan case was over one inch deep. Thus, I will have to either return the unit or go purchase new screws to attach the fan. Otherwise, the product appears to be as advertised."
4,Made in China,They all work. But I hate buying things made in sweat shops. I would not want to work in a sweat shop. I believe the workers that made these get less than one dollar an hour. And are forced to work long hours. I feel guilty buying these.
2,Zipper broke immediately,"Fabric is nice and soft but zipper broke the first time we used it. Very disappointing. The fit was fine, so we still use it to get our monies worth"
4,A little too big,"I love my Brest Friend but since you can't/shouldn't dry the covers in the dryer, I really wanted two. This cover is great--exactly like the one that came on it. I was glad to realize that the Deluxe is different and ordered appropriately. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's too big. It doesn't fit tight and form fitting. It's close and still very convenient but not quite as good as the one that came with it."
5,Good quality & plush,"I love My Brestfriend pillow but hated the cheap cover it came with. I ordered this one and couldn't be happier. It is nice quality and very soft. The color looks much better in person, it's a light blue. I ended up ordering another one to use when the other is hang drying. The only thing you have to mind is hanging it to dry and being careful that blankets & clothing don't stick to the extra velcro. It can sometimes stick to it but it really hasn't been a problem."
4,Not if you had a C-section,"I think this is an awesome product; however, I ended up in a C-section which made using this very uncomfortable. The incision of C-section was at the exact spot this cushion sat which was painful for the first 6+ weeks. At that point I had gotten used to using pillows to help prop my son up. I did like that the cover was washable and the little bumps elevated my son's head perfectly. I must say I was quite bummed I couldn't use this as much as I would have liked to due to my c-section."
5,"Back to 1966, with Batman!!","This Album from the Marketts, is really a 'blast from the past for me.I have the Crown label' Maxwell Davis' album titled Batman , I had given to me when I was 6 yrs old/ in 66, and yes when I put it on my record player, hoping for the 'POW/ZAP-ZOWIEE! of the Adam West Batman TV Series, I was a little so-so disappointed at not hearing familiar voices or sounds from the Classic show, but as years had gone by, as with this album, Batman Theme/ by the Marketts, Pulling these records out to hear them again you get a 'new perspective of what was really happening in '66!! big drums! heavy backbeat! Total Instrumentation Created by 'true to life musicians!The Marketts have a sound that define the era, and bring back those 'old childhood memories of a Superhero 'gone by!"
2,Dated,"This Cd proves the old saying, "" You can't go home again.."" I enjoyed this album when I was a kid BUT that was 44 years ago. Sorry there are no campy hip tunes here.Just dated late 60's over dubbed guitar music. If you insist on a pop Batman album get the Neal Hefti verson. It is marginally better."
3,Must Have Lost a Lot in Translation,"Having grown up with comics and not being familiar with Manga I had not preconceptions as to what this would be like. What I did find was a very one dimensional kind of drawing (and why do all the japanese have round eyes) with characters that are drawn so similar to each other it's sometimes hard to tell who is who.One of the major things that bothered me about this novel was 'where is the graphic part', it seems as if parts of the drawings are missing or totally left out. As to the the translation, there are at least 25% that have no comment at all, and many with just '...' (an ellipse), and much of the one's that have japanese characters in them have no translation at all. So how much of the story is missed and how much seems to be just filler. The two 150 page sections could have been cut down to one and been much more interesting.Zeb Kantrowitzzbestblogaround.blogspot.com"
3,Not Their Best Effort,"Although this disc has some tracks that are quite satisfying, overall this is another grouping of songs(like Feel Euphoria) where the band is continuing to get its post-Neal Morse sea legs. Another step in the right direction."
3,Has Its Ups and Downs,"As others have stated, this book has errors, and what's worse those errors are not even pointed out on the book's website. The least the author/publisher could do is keep the website up-to-date.The good part is this book does contain some interesting effects with ActionScript, but this is not a book for ActionScript beginners. It is for people with either some background in ActionScript already, or with JavaScript. Otherwise, you will be frustrated very quickly. The quality of the physical publication is quite high with excellent paper stock, full color throughout and long book width. New Riders, to their credit, rarely produces cheap physical products.In all, this book has some good meaty content, but poor technical editing to catch the errors mars its overall usefulness; hence the mixed review."
5,Dragging is not such a drag anymore!,"I got the book yesterday, and today I've already done things I thought I couldn't do. This is the first book that walks me through the code so that I understand what I'm doing and can apply it to my work. I also love that he explains effects I can really use.I've just completed the projects in chapter two, ""Drag,"" and already I've learned more about movie clips than I had in the last four months. Finally someone has written a book on Flash that is clear and interesting and, best of all, immediately useful."
1,"Errors, errors errors","This book is FULL of errors in its code. Unless you know actionscript well enough to figure out the errors on your own to make the code work, you'll be very disappointed. I am thankful I bought it used and didn't pay full price. Avoid this book and save yourself a lesson in frustration. I think he wrote it with the motivation to make people think actionscript is very hard and thus limit his competition."
1,Do Not Purchase if you want to follow with resource files. DOES NOT EXIST!,"Be warned. If you are intending to download the resource files and follow along with the excercises....or want to look at finished projects with finished code.... The web site and resources that the book refers to NO LONGER EXISTS. I emailed both the publisher New Riders, and the author Brendan Dawes and have still not heard from them after two weeks. May have some useful information for you but if you want to follow along as the book suggests.... BE WARNED. I would be extra careful with any titles by New Riders or Brendan Dawes. Do research about the resources BEFORE you purchase."
1,Errors.....errors.....errors,"I bought this book with much excitement based on the examples I was going to learn through the step and step approach. Brenden assumes you have some knowledge of ActionScript and therefore assumes that you can pick-up on his errors and correct them for yourself. For a newbie who is learning ActionScript for the first time should not be learning from a book with so many errors. Not only is this very, very frustrating for a newbie but it quells the excitement of a newbie from learning ActionScript....at least for awhile. The book was probably rushed out to the stores without thoroughly testing the examples."
4,Great for learning common ActionScript tasks,"This book is great for learning how some of the great Flash tricks are done. I'm not a designer or Flash programmer by trade, but after perusing this book I was able to employ my knowledge of similar ECMA languages to ActionScript and create sliding and fading effects as well as a few others.Highly recommended for someone trying to expand their ActionScript toolset.-Steve ParksMacromedia Certified InstructorMacromedia Certified Advanced Cold Fusion MX DeveloperCold Fusion Developer's Journal Contributing Author"
1,Keep looking...,"This book is poorly organized and lacks focus. The topics' coverage is shallow. Even with the lightweight content, it should be titled or described as ""How to Transition COM+ programming with VB to C#""."
4,Now I understand C# and COM+,Excellent book for a person that needs to understand how C# and COM+ work together. Well written.
5,Great Jack that looks surprisingly professional,"I bought this a few months back to juryrig an Aux-in jack for my car stereo that didn't have one. When it arrived I was pretty surprised by the size of the thing as I'd never tried doing this sort of thing before however soldering wires to the leads was pretty easy, especially with two pairs of hands.Like other reviewers have said, the lack of documentation is annoying (it basically arrives in a small ziploc bag all by its lonesome) but it's easy enough to figure out and the guy below me did a pretty good job explaining it.One thing I was surprised by though was how professional the plug looked once installed. Frankly, it looked like it belonged there, as if it had been installed at the factory.And I've not once had any trouble with plugging and unplugging the cable. It's rock solid once installed.Overall, I don't feel like the the lack of documentation is worth docking a star from this excellent jack. I'm litterally about to buy another one right now."
3,Works,"A bit expensive and the markings are so incredibly tiny (yes, it is a small part) that they are extremely hard to see. If needed, I would probably order again."
2,"Nice visuals, but nothing much else going on.","This is my favorite era of pulp, and seeing the hard to find covers is a treat. The author, a pornographer with vision, is like the Ann Coulter of girly mags--unfortunately righteous, horny, and self-important. One wishes that we were given a man's take on the models and photography instead of a women well over 50 preaching at us and presenting research as some sort of creative act. Buy it for the numerous reproductions of an era for the most part lost forever."
5,I didn't think it could get any better...,"... than Pilgrim Heart and Breath of the Heart, but it did. I call this man the voice of God. Listen to ""Puja"" and see if it doesn't pierce right through you. And ""Hey Mata Durga"" is soulful, spare, humble and equally touching. If you live a Yoga lifestyle and/or are a Krishna Das fan, buy this CD. You won't regret it."
3,Much more mellow than Pilgrim Heart,"I'm a big KD fan, but I gravitate more towards his upbeat music especially when I practice Astanga/Power yoga. Not that this CD is horrible or anything, I was hoping for more of that infectious invigorating beat that was so prevalant on his Pilgrim Heart CD, so I was pretty disappointed to hear the more mellow tone of this one. It would probably be OK for cool down and sivasana."
5,"""Krishna Das sings to my heart""","This is a beautiful and deeply meditative acoustic offering from Krishna Das, totally different from his other recordings. His voice comes from his soul, full of longing and love. He breaks your heart, only to make it bigger so it can fill with love.These are chants to immerse yourself in and become one with.Thank you KD! With love from a fan."
5,Oh-My-God.,"This is the first Krishna Das for me. His voice is so stunning and vibrant ~ good lord! Can you stand it? It reverberates with emotion. I cannot have a conversation when this is on. It takes one into the Sun immediately. It causes inner explosions. It is almost too much to drink, so filled it is, with sukra-sweet feeling. Sri Hanuman Chaleesa is my excruciating favorite, with Shiva Stuti following close behind. Krishna Das says Shiva's name like they are intimate lovers. Omygod!!"
5,Deep Puja,"The poetic flow of these prayers alone help me calm my own inner turmoil. If one wants more info on the transliteration and English translation of these pujas, go to Krishna Das's web site and download the lyrics. Enjoy."
3,Graceful chanting with a modern twist,"I had an opportunity to hear many of the Krishna Das' music/songs and choose to purchase this CD simply because of its title. While the CD is still very interesting, there are other chants from him that I liked better. I just have to find the right CD. Still this is a fine music for relaxation and affirmation. It is mostly in Hundu, but the last song is my favorite one and it is a celebration of faith in combination English and Hindu language."
4,I loved the behind the scenes stories and the on-ice banter!,"As a hockey offical myself, I loved the stories from the officials. Learning both how it was done in the old days and some of the techniques and stories of the guys that are currently working. Every official has and gives advice or what he feels the key to working well and continuing to work well at a high level. I took carefull notes.It gives the fans a different perspective of these guys. It sheds a different light. Not always the bad guy and it tells how officials prize the chance to work in the playoffs just as much as the players do. If not sometimes more.I really liked it. I could relate. It is a must read for any young (at heart) aspiring hockey offical.G.L. Winnipeg, MB."
2,So-so Insight into NHL Referees,"By his own admission, Mr. Irvin placed a microphone on the table, recorded their comments and, basically, transcribed word-for-word what NHL referees, past and present, had to say about the game.While by no means does repeating subject comments, practically, verbatim to text represent a weak effort, in Mr. Irvin's case one would have expected more. Considering he has direct lineage of one of hockeys most storied coaches, has seen practically every Montreal Canadiens game in the past 40 or 50 years, has written dozens of hockey books and provided countless analysis on HNIC this book represents a let down. Given the lack of 'off-ice observer' insight one would expect from someone who practically grew up in the Forum, we are then left with large-scale referee reminiscing, much of it repetitive (entry into the profession, forced early retirement, mentors), however with little depth and not much to re-new our appreciation for the men in stripes."
4,Enduro Road racing....,"I also race WKA nationals.. SOmetimes against Pierre... This video gives an excellent oversight into the world of Enduro Road Racing.. I have been racing on the national level for 3 years, and the presentation shows the passion level these guys and gals have. With ages from 16 to well past retirement, this sport gives promise to racers dreams, and Pierre's video gives the viewer a little taste of this exciting sport. The in Kart action is very well done, and I must say the production of the video is VER professional.. Better than some of the Grammy winners.. It get's my vote!! Karl Dulle Laydown 54 NEW HAMPSHIRE KARTING ASSOCIATION...And as a last comment.. Get off the couch when your'e done watching this video, and get racing baby!"
3,easy fast,i returned product with out a problem it was not what i wanted but it was easy and every thing went smooth
2,Not an accurate photo representation of delivered product,"What is pictured as the product description is not what was delivered. I received light wood (rough cut, unsanded, unfinished) blocks with very cheap sandpaper. I contacted the seller and received a refund. I was told they were going to look at their remaining inventory so hopefully they get it resolved. Seller was great to work with, it was just a shoddy product."
1,Dangerous Toy,These blocks were un-sanded with wood splinters down the sides of both wooden blocks. The sand paper was cheap and tore the first time I rubbed these together. You get what you pay for in this case. I should have made these myself. I could have done a better job.
5,the best tuna for the price!,"This tuna has to be the best for the price! Most of the others are only 5 ounces, this is 6 ounces. The olive oil is very light, and honestly doesn't have much of a taste. I sometimes add a little extra virgin olive oil since I prefer a more ""olivey"" taste. The tuna is consistent from can to can in color, firmness and quality- no dark mushy blobs like are found in other types of tuna. It can be taken straight out of the can, oil and all and placed on top of a green salad for a great entree and just season to taste with a little balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper- no draining necessary. I can't wait to order another case of this great product."
5,Spanish English Dictionary,PERFECT! Product in great quality. For my daughter's high school Spanish class. Just what we needed! Thanks!
4,works for me in terms of completeness,"I have at least 6 different Spanish-English dictionaries and some are special purpose like ones for construction and ""Costa Rica Spanish"" and the hit rate on finding a word I come across in them is about 75% except for the Christopher Howard Official Guide to Costa Rican Spanish where the hit rate for me has been about 25%. With this dictionary my hit rate so far has been 100% and this included the very obscure (for the dictionary editors at least) word taller that all my other dictionaries translate as an artist studio but the New World adds the usage of the word for a garage or repair shop.Not very compact for travel but I am tempted to buy a second copy and tear it in half and take only the Spanish to English section. It is a Castilian Spanish dictionary so many words used in Mexico, Central, and South America are not going to be in it but that is too be expected and not too different from the various English idioms in use in different parts of the world."
4,"Great, comprehensive product","I bought this for my middle school student who's just starting to learn Spanish. It's very ""user friendly"" and should last him through his entire Spanish education."
2,No Genders in the English Part!,"I bought this dictionary because it has larger type than some, and appeared large enough to have most commonly used words in it. HOWEVER, I did not notice that it does not give the gender of Spanish nouns when you look them up in English. Therefore, you have to look up a noun TWICE - once in the English section and again in the Spanish section to find out its gender. A major omission in my opinion - I plan to return the dictionary!"
5,My personal favorite among English/Spanish dictionaries.,"I've been speaking, reading & writing Spanish for 30 years now, and I've owned many different dictionaries and other reference materials. Of all the dictionaries I've owned, this one is my favorite and is the one I always recommend to others who are just starting out, and it's the one that I still turn to. Not only is it one of the most complete, but it also explains ways in which words are used in everyday, idiomatic expressions. What's more, the cost of this book has remained remarkably reasonable. You can't beat it at any price."
2,I would not purchase from this company again,There was nothing wrong with the flag pole itself but I had some issues with a bracket that was advertised to be included with the pole that they did not send. They claimed it was an error on advertising and they would not make good on it. They so much as told me if I didn't like it to just return it. At my expense of course. I would never purchase from this company based on how they treat there customers. There are other companies out there that take pride in there customer service. Just my 2 cents....
5,The best baby book ever,"I bought this for my son when he was 1 year old. This was by far his favourite book. He loved looking at all the different expressions of baby faces. I made up a stories for each page with loads of enthusiam in my voice. He absolutely loved it. My son is now 8 years old and this book was still on his book shelf when my daughter was born. My daughter has developmental delay and didn't show any interest in books until 18 months and this was the first book that she showed any interest in. She loves this book as much or maybe even more than my first son. I am seeing the appeal of this book all over again and through different eyes. I am using this book to teach my daughter the parts of the face and this is only way that she is able to learn eyes, mouth etc. I am throughly enjoying this book 8 years later and putting it to a new use...."
5,Best 1st Baby book,"This is a great simple book for babies and I know from experience that it is durable and stands the test of time. I got this book for my daughter when she was a baby, now 4 1/2 and my son who is 9 months old. This was the 1st thing I purchased when I knew I was pregnant the second time. I knew he'd enjoy it as much as my daughter did. They both love it. My 9 month old son searches this book out on is book shelf and happy screams when he finds it. Then opens the book and kisses all the babies. A must buy for any family and a great price."
3,Just okay...,"DK made sure this book is full of babies of different cultures and genders...so good job there. But I thought some of the pictures were odd or didn't ""fit"". There is a peek a boo picture and it says, ""Where is baby?"" and he's right there holding a basket over his head in plain view. Then on the facing page it says, ""Peek a Boo!"" with the basket lifted a smidge higher... I wish the basket were covering his face in the first picture. It doesn't make sense. And then there is a picture of two babies kissing but all you can see is the back of one of the babies heads....just weird to me... I probably wouldn't have purchased this had I seen it in the store."
5,Great little book!,"After researching and finding that babies love to look at the faces of other babies, I thought that this book looked the best after I read quite a few book reviews about it. It has one face per page, and it's a board book so that the little hands of a one-year-old can look alone or with me but not tear the pages. My twin grandsons are both fascinated with this book. They laugh at the faces, and they often sit and look through it on their own much longer than they spend with other books alone. I recommend it to anyone with a baby! I think the book will interest them for several years because later they can make up stories of why each baby is making the face! Love it!"
4,"Also bought ""Smile"" book but this holds up much better!","My 7 month old became very interested in baby faces so I decided to purchase this and the other board book ""Smile"" since both have a diverse group of baby faces. Both have held up well and keep her interest but this one BY FAR has held up the best out of all our board books. I like that there are words for feelings. Some day she'll learn them all!"
5,My 10-month-old loves this book!,"She saw this in the store and liked it right away. She gets a huge smile on her face when she looks at the babies. This morning, I heard her cooing and talking to herself, so I went to see what was entertaining her. She was reading the book to herself! I would have to say this is definitely her favorite book. Who would have thought? It is so simple. I guess sometimes, simple is best!"
5,Small but Awesome!,"This book is small, but my sons love it, they look at the faces & recognize the expressions, I don't know if you can teach empathy but I try. This is one of their favorite go to books, I think because they can relate to the age group. I was a little upset about how small the book was at first, but honestly its perfect for thier little hands, there are plenty of faces in there & I love the different races I do wish they had more though, but its not enough to knock off any stars *****!"
4,Short but sweet,"There is not much to this book. It teaches baby expressions. There is nothing a baby likes more than looking at babies, so this one's a winner in my book."
5,Neal Shakes It.,"The First 2 Songs I Heard From Neal Where: ""No Doubt About It"", And ""Wink"". He Dances The Night Away On ""The Shake"" Which Also Appears On The ""Be Good At It"" Album. He Can Sing Ballads Like: ""The City Put The Country Back In Me"", ""For A Change"", ""Their Playing Our Song"", ""You Gotta Love That"", And ""You Can Tell Me Goodbye"". This CD Will Never Leave My House."
4,"Starts poorly, ends well","Despite it's 188 pages, this small format book is a quick read. The first half gives a rambling history of the telescope while the second half presents a much more focused telling of the making of Palomar's 200"" telescope. Much of the Palomar history is in the form of quotes from the numerous letters of the various participants. It is illustrated with a wealth of excellent photographs of the telescope components and their manufacture. The book ends abruptly with the dedication speeches made upon the telescope's completion.If you can get this book for a reasonable price, you will enjoy it. But given the small size and mixed content, I think if you pay more than $25 for it you will feel ripped off."
1,SHAME!!!!!,"She is the worst artist in Greece. It is a pity that young people listen to her. An important woman, that'all!"
5,soothing smart comedy,"I've watched this movie on film, videotape and now finally on DVD. It's Matthau at his best as an old, crochety, witty supreme court justice who is forced to work with a woman for the first time. It holds up over the years and is one of those films you want to put on when you just want to forget the world, calm your nerves, and enjoy something that makes you feel good. The same for another Matthau movie ""Hopscotch"" which I'm waiting for on DVD. You'll enjoy this for sure."
2,The Supreme Court is nothing like this,"This is the only movie I know whose subject is the Supreme Court. Maybe after this one nobody wanted to make another one. Silly plot, ridiculous dialog, cliched he vs. she storyline. I think they wanted this to resemble one of the old Tracy/Hepburn films but this is far from that league. It also doesn't in the slightest resemble the actual Supreme Court. Can anyone imagine a justice as young as Jill Clayburgh is in this movie?"
2,Ho Hum,"From my seat as an amateur movie reviewer, First Monday In October ranks as a dissappointment. I always enjoy Walter Matheau as an actor. He has a special charm to his acting style. However, his humor is pretty stifled here. Also the he vs she plot just seems a bit too tiresome here. Matheau argues for the sake of arguing and that is never too pleasant.Jill Clayburgh is mis-cast as the first woman Supreme Court Justice. She is way too young for such a role and that hampers the film from the get go.The pornographic subplot also is addressed in such a boring way. The general plot does not excite me in anyway. I tried viewing this a second time to give it the benefit of the doubt. However, the arguing between Matheau and Clayburgh became more annoying than funny.Walter Matheau's presence is probably the only reason this movie even earns two stars. His charm shines thru every now and then. Otherwise this movie is a flop."
4,good value,"Fan does what it is supposed to do which is increase or decrease speed based upon the temperature of a sensor. It seems pretty quiet. I think it makes a lot of sense if your backplate has this size vent on it, to install it for some additional airflow, but you should be careful not to blow air towards your CPU (it doesn't seem to like this even if the air is cold.)Double check and make sure you have the sensor mounted on the outside if you want an exhaust fan or the thermal sensor on the inside if you want an intake fan."
1,A big Disapointment,"Having read the book, I attempted to glean the programming portion of the book which did not explain the windows components, API's, VBX calls, etc. The book was complicated and left much to be desired."
1,Visual dBASE Programming Limited,"The title implies the book will be useful for programming in Visual dBASE, but it is limited to Visual dBASE 5.* I however am trying to learn Visual dBASE 7.*, and by chapter 3 I am already hung up. But the book never mentions that the language is limited to version 5.* So I am stuck with ...worthless code, just because the author and/or publisher was unwilling to specify the limitations of the book."
5,bebe winans shows he can sing!,I can't talk about just one song on this albumn. all demonstrate why the bebe@cece duo are famous and why bebe can sing. this is a good mix of r@b and gospel to please all music fans.
3,I'm not so sure about this one,"The subject pretty much spells it out. The most important thing to look at with any of these books (which I realized after the fact) is the publishing date. If the text is more than ten years old, you can pretty much assume that most of the information is too out-of-date to be accurate. ""How's that possible, history doesn't change,"" you may ask. Well, it does. As new archeological sites are uncovered and new texts are found and examined, our understanding of history changes. The dates of the battles may be on target, but looking through the pages with a knowledge of more recent findings (especially the images) is rough, at best."
2,Not universal...,"I live in South Korea and that is where I bought my baby bed. Unfortunately, the base does not have a universal mount and I cannot use it. I have found another mount in Korea but have to order it. The mount is a large plastic circle and not flexible or soft. It is designed to pinch the based against the rail of the bed. It is cute, I just hope I get to use it."
5,Wonderful!,My little girl who is now almost 4 months has loved this mobile since the day she saw it. She spent her first two weeks in NICU and we were able to leave the mobile attached to her crib. I think it brought her a lot of comfort and the actual sound of the mobile is better than we expected it to be. Some baby swings and toys that play songs are very harsh and somewhat unpleasant to listen to- but not this one.
5,OUR SON LOVED IT!,"My son loved t. We recently took it off the crib and he's now seven months! Even though it was past the time it said on the box, 0-5 months, our son just sat up at 7 months. As long as they can't reach it, it's great entertainment. He loved the music, loved staring at Snoopy and ""talking"" to it. No matter what was going on in his room, if we'd play the music, he'd stop and stare. Too cute! It's a shame we have to take it down. Wish we could use it longer."
2,Ours falls off of the crib rail very easily!!!,"Our daughter does love to look at it and watch it, but it slips off the rail and falls. It fell and hit her on the head once. I had to move it to the end of the crib so it will fall the other direction when it does fall, and I have to tighten it every day or so because it loosens on its own."
5,5 Stars plus,"If you love the game of Golf , you will love this movie. It's funny, romantic, and a well produced movie"
2,Nora Roberts Chesapeake Bay CD Colection,"The book is excellent, but the quality of CD's themselves are TERRIBLE. Entire phrases and sentances repeat and then the CD's skips. If I hadn't been part way through before this happened, I would have returned them immediately. Will be finding another source to purchase further products of this type."
3,Cheasapeake Series,"It should be listened to in the unabridged series.Too much missing in the abridged edition although a great story of family life, love and sea."
5,CHESAPEAKE BAY CD COLLECTION,Started slow for me and wasn't sure I would like the first character introduced. Grew to love him. Loved the comingling of characters; the settings;the outcome. This is the reason I collect Nora Roberts' (and JD Robb) writing. Her work is NOT predictable. She amazes me.
4,New Nora Fan,"I have recently become a user of audiobooks and my first book were thesse by Nora, and they were really enjoyable. I believe I'll purchase some more."
3,OK Transmitter,"Item does work. It's easy enough to use. The ability to charge it in the car, is a nice feature. Has some trouble maintaining range. For some reason worked better in one car versus another. The biggest drawback is it's limited frequency and range. OK product for the price."
2,No locking pin access,"Thought it was the kind that you can use a locking pin, but it isn't. You should show the back of the item."
4,Very solid piece and looks great,"Looks great and is nice and solid.... not too crazy about it's ""theft prevention"", seems like a hard pull of the cover would defeat it, hence my 4 star rating"
2,Historical look..............,"This CD is made up of studio demos and outtakes. It is nothing more or less, it shows songs very raw and in need of lots of work. As a long time Asia fan I was probably expecting more but to be honest after one listen I had what I needed from it. I would say buy this if you are a completist like myself but if you are looking for the sound of the 1st incarnation of Asia listen to the old albums because you won't find it here. It may be good that they did not stay together because both sides Wetton(solo) and Downes (w/Asia and John Payne) have done much better work than these demos."
1,Not the slick AZIA studio production I expected,"I bought this disc with high hopes, having been a longtime fan of AZIA. Unfortunately the low production values and ""first take"" feel of this disc left the music sounding unremarkable to me. The trite lyrics would probably sound fine if orchestrated in typical lavish Azia style, but here, it sounds like something your sister's boyfriend would write. Buy the recent Aura disc from Azia and you won't be dissappointed. It's probably the best that these guys have ever done."
4,Classic Country Sounds,"Ricky Skaggs cut his teeth on bluegrass music. He picked up a mandolin at the age of five and within ten years was performing in Ralph Stanley's Clinch Mountain Boys. Following a stint in Emmylou Harris's Hot Band while still in his twenties, Skaggs brought a traditionalist sensibility to country music and throughout the Eighties was one of country music's hottest stars.By the Nineties, the country hits stopped and to date Life Is a Journey is Skaggs' last country effort. Within months Skaggs returned to bluegrass music with the stunning Bluegrass Rules! and hasn't looked back. But if you enjoy straight ahead country music with lots of fiddles, steel guitar and mandolin, this is as good as any of Skagg's Eighties' albums.Highlights are a remake of Steve Earle's ""Hillbilly Highway,"" the toe-tapping ""Straight to You,"" the upbeat ""Ain't Love a Good Thing"" and the reflective ""Voices Singing."" As the title says ""Life Is a Journey."" Enjoy the ride. RECOMMENDED"
1,Codependent No More: Beyond Bolognie,"The greeting card text of this book frustrated me. So, we who love are codependent? This was the impression that one could conclude. I found this book to be weakly written and unsubstantiated; no valid statistics given. The ""Codependency Conspiracy"", by Dr. Stan J. Katz and Aimee E. Liu takes an opposite approach. Perhaps some need a ""Hallmark card"" intent. Give me meat and potatoes, something I can sink my teeth in to."
4,Good for occasional use,"Too small for rollers, but great for conditioning, gloss, semi-permanent color, etc. bonnet is the size of 3-layer cake. Short hose, but that saves fan power and weight. Consider spending more if planning regular use."
2,soft bonnet hair dryer,I only gave this a 2 star because i have medium to short hair and after 3/4 of an hour it did'nt dryit. i would not recomend this.
4,Treating hair is easiwer with this bonnet,"Thanks to this dryer, I can easily move when my hair is drying. it also easees my deep conditioning treatment."
2,Hair dryer great but the hose is not,I love being able to have a salon quality style from home. This little hair dryer works a treat to bring out the best curl. BUT the hose has ripped and torn in three places so far. I have had to duct tape the hose together. I would recommend discovering if another product has a better quality hose before purchasing.
5,compact drying option,"This was a gift for my ""old fashioned"" daughter. She's been trying vintage hair styles and a bonnet hair dryer was required for many of those old styles. She loves it! It packs up easily and is easy to use. It doesn't get too hot so it doesn't burn your hair, It also doesn't have a long cord for mobility but grab a book and sit a spell. Your new hairdo will be a blast!"
4,My Wife likes the Hairdryer,Is a shame that we have 240 Volt in Australia and I had to buy a stepdown transformer wich made it more expansive.
1,bad purchase,"cheap and misleading. Can't believe Conair puts their name on this product. The hose is only 2 ft long and the bonnet is tiny. Won't fit over my rollers. In addition, the hose will not stay connected to the bonnet. If you move at all, it falls off! I am soo disappointed and angry i wasted my money on this purchase. Don't fall for the false advertising."
2,Low Quality Conair,"The dryer overheats and shuts off and cannot be reset (You have to wait until it cools down on its own or only use it on a low heat setting); the tube that connects the bonnet is not very durable. Conair could do better - my last two Conair dryers have not lasted. I can't recommend this item.(And note - I bought this unit from a store, not Amazon, so Conair cannot blame their lack of quality on Amazon)"
1,Believe the other reviews,Conair SB1X Soft Bonnet Hair DryerBelieve the other reviews. This dryer quit mid drying--the first time I used it.
1,Bonnet will not last,I thought it worked great the few times I used it but I should have heeded what others wrote here. The bonnet is very cheap and became unusable after only a few times of use.
5,Compact and Dries Well,"The poor reviews for this product really surprised me. I've had my Conair for years, and although I don't use it often, I have never had any trouble with it at all. The biggest problem I've had is getting the bonnet over some larger rollers. My unit heats up and dries hair beautifully. Also, it's small and light weight so it's very easy to store."
1,"High hopes dashed, powerless dryer reduces carbon footprint","Had great hopes that this dryer would fit the bill for my kids. Wanted to dry their hair without deafening them with the noise from a regular ""gun"" style hairdryer. My folks dried my hair like this when I was a kid (okay 35 years ago).Had only used this dryer on 3-4 occasions when the power switch failed to turn the dryer on anymore. Have fiddled with the switch a bit, jiggled it a bit, all with no luck. Will need to see if there's some way I can return it. Haven't had it for a year yet.On the plus side, I'm saving the earth by not using electricity I suppose."
1,Don't But It!,"This dryer shuts off constantly. It is so annoying. Years ago when I bought hair dryers I never had this problem. These days their making junk products that are simply a waste of money. Do not buy this product you will certainly be disappointed. I have very long here so normally it takes one hour to dry it and with this piece of junk shutting off constantly, it takes even longer. The cost to ship it back makes no sense so I just have to take the lose."
1,Bonnet much too small!,I am disappointed in the Bonnet and the way it connects to the hose. The Bonnet is extremely small for a large bonnet and it is very hard to attach the hose to the bonnet.I have started to use my old hair dryer although the bonnet is torn and the high setting no longer works.
5,Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer,Had a very old bonnet hair dryer that is about shot. Had to find a replacement and this Conair is it. Great for vacations and home use. Easy to use and works well especially when you use rollers to curl your hair like I do.
4,Conair Soft Bonnet hair dryer,"The hair dryer works fine as expected. The only issue I have is that after you get the bonnet and tubing out of the case, you just can't fit it back in easily. I have tendonitis in my right hand so I can't be trying to push and shove and push and shove to get it back in, so I just use a big heavy plastic zip up case that I have from another product bought years ago that I just put the whole hair dryer in and be done with it."
3,Longer Hose,"I like that I can sit in my bed and dry my hair, but it's a little (just a little) uncomfortable. If it had a longer hose and if the storage compartment had instructions on how to place it back inside it would be spectacular. Also, I shopped around for this product. I went to several beauty supply stores and they were mucho expensive. This was the right price."
2,adequate for the type of product that it is,Difficult to place on head. Could use a waist strap for heating unit so it doesn't keep falling off the table while putting on bonnet
2,NOTHING SPECIAL,DOESN'T REALLY GET HOT ENOUGH FOR ETHNIC HAIR. PROBABLY WOULD WORK FINE FOR SOMEONE WITH REALLY THIN HAIR
3,This item has a few problems ---,"The item is described as a ""soft bonnet"" hair dryer. The dryer works, but the bonnet is not at all soft. It occasionally irritates the neck because of stiffness where the hose joins the bonnet. The temperatures can get too hot; low heat is hotter than my previous hair dryer ever got on its maximum heat setting. Watch out!"
1,Damp and Disappointed,"I thought it was a neighborhood power outage. I like to set my hair after shampooing and go to sleep. My hair is long and thick so I set the temp on ""High"". The Conair Soft Bonnet just shut off without warning which woke me up. I had to wait more than 5 minutes before I could start it again and still ended up sleeping with damp hair. This has happened too many times. I should have read some reviews first which would have helped my damp locks and saved me some money in the long run."
1,Poor Quality,"When I first saw this dryer I thought it was a toy. Quality very poor, and when I tried it was worst. It took me almost 2 hours to dry my hair. I do not recommend it at all."
4,Great little dryer!!,The bonnet is nice and large and the air flow is just right for my hair. It has done a good job for me.
1,I used it for 3 weeks and it broke!,I used it for 3 weeks and the motor made tons of noise and then stopped. It did not work well from the beginning and the motor got worse with each use. I used it about 10 times. I was Sooo disappointed. At the price it was not worth returning..I dumped it.... what a waste of money . I am so upset with this conair product.. You get what you pay for. THe plus is the bonnet was soft...I kept the bonnet and threw out the dryer.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM,"I purchased this item a few months ago because I wanted a soft bonnet dryer to replace my old dryer. The price seemed reasonable. I did not have the problems several other customers experienced with the dryer stopping and then restarting. At least their's restarted. My unit just died on me while drying my hair. I was never able to get it restarted. I had owned the unit for only a few months so I did not think Amazon would accept a late return. The storing of the tubing, bonnet and cord was very difficult with each use. The space was too small to accomodate everything. The medium setting tended to be very hot. I wish I had read the other reviews prior to purchasing. I am now stuck without a hair dryer at home. This item was a complete waste of money. Please DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM."
1,not to happy,"I am surprised to see that it is hard to put away in case and I would like a way to talk to someone on the shipping for $19.99 and it took almost 5 days to get, I WON'T BE ORDERING AGAIN. If I was to get a call and get a refund, I am concerned about the bad reviews that I have seen for this product."
4,hair dryer worth cost,"works well. Delivered in good quality. Helpful for people with disability, or trying to heat hair or head for longer period of time. Several temperature control."
1,JUNK,"My sister had one and I did too. The dryer would turn off on everything but the low setting right out of the box. Both units did this. Do not buy. No, you're not going to be one of the lucky ones...don't buy this piece of junk."
1,awful awful awful,"would give it a 0 if i couldbonnet had a hole in it, and the air just doesnt seem to get through. this is a cheap product--make the investment!"
2,hair dryer,The dryer does not look very sturdy (inferior plastic) also when using dryer the cap became very soft and felt like it was melting.
3,Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer,I have had Conair soft bonnet hair dryers in the past with great success. This one performs ok with the one exception that the bonnet is not as large as in previous products. I have long hair and I use large rollers. I find that getting the bonnet over these rollers is a little more difficult. I also have to put a towel around the back of my neck to avoid excessive heat near the hose connection.
1,hair dryer,This dryer is like a toy. Not much heat. Not much power. I wanted it to use it for heat conditioning. I was not satisfied
3,Work when it wants,This is the second time I have purhcased this dryer. It still stops in the middle of drying my hair. I refused to return it again.
1,A Complete Waste of money!,"This dryer is a total waste of time and money; it shuts off constantly, so it takes forever to dry your hair. I wish I had read the other reviews before I wasted the money. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Quit working after two uses,"I bought this dryer strictly to use for deep conditioning my hair after reading the reviews that it didn't work well for drying hair. It worked beautifully for this the first two times I used it, I just hooked it up to use for the third time and it worked for about 15 seconds (I started on the cool setting) then shut off...I tried other outlets in case that was the issue. It is a dead dryer. I'm very disappointed in this product."
1,Most Dissatisfied,Motor overheats after several minutes and shuts down.Will restart after a period of time. Then shortly overheats again.Unit VERY poorly designed.Unit VERY cheaply constructed.
1,Say NO to Conair bonnet hair dryer,"This product is terrible, after turning it on for 3 minutes the dryer shut off,and did not come back on. Dont waste your time on this product."
2,Inconsistent at best,"This unit would be perfect but for the fact that if it stays on the highest heat setting for more than 15-20 minutes, it shuts off. Sometimes it shuts off after only 5 minutes if not ""warmed up"" first on a lower setting. I read the product instructions backwards and forwards, and none of this was mentioned. There was a mention of the product shutting off, but it was caviated with the point that this was a very unlikely possibility. Well, I use the product twice a week--once on high for a deep conditioning, and then immediately after for a wet set on a lower setting--and it shuts off twice a week. It just elongates an already lengthy process. Extremely frustrating."
1,Defective product,I bought this hair dryer recently and was totally dissatisfied. It was very difficult to open the plastic case that housed the bonnet and hose. The dryer turned itself off periodically throughout operation. Save yourself frustation and buy a more expensive model!!
1,WHAT A SCAM!,"Ordered this product without reading other reviews first. Wish I had because these ladies are dead on. The dryer cuts off as soon as it starts to get hot. Don't waste your time or money. It's Saturday. My hair is wet and set, and I'm left without a dryer. I've tried three times: twice on high and once on medium setting. I'm sending this back right away. Amazon don't let Conair blame this on you. This model is DEFECTIVE!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I had wanted a hair dryer for xmas which I got. I was so happy that way I didn't have to be under a hooded hair dryer. Well every time I have used it and it's not many, I put the hair dryer on medium heat and it will be okay for a couple of minutes, 5 minutes and automatically shut off. What the hell. Now I have curlers in my hair and this thing decides to shut off when it feels like. This is going straight back to the store. This is the worst hair dryer.Signed wet hair."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"This product is a nightmare! The bonnet refused to completely fill with air and the hose is stiff and not long enough. The bonnet is also made of tissue thin plastic and if the unit would work correctly, the bonnet would most likely not even last a year's worth of use. I patched the hose on my 23 year old general electric hair dryer{which is still working} and decided to deep six the piece of junk! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,Hair Dryer,"I was disappointed in this product as the bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer I was using by Hot Tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers. After using about 5 times it stopped working. I will say that it is compact for travelling but feel that it is undependable. The temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint. I ended up purchasing another Hot Tools Dryer, a little more money but worth the price in the long run."
3,Hair Dryer,"It works fairly well, although the bonnet hose twists too easily. It ended up overheating and shutting down for a few minutes. Finally started again and finished the job."
1,horrible,I hope that I do not have to give this item a star; it does not deserve even one. Apparently Amazon requires at least one star. Please ignore the star. I found it very difficult to use because the hose is so short and the unit is so light weight. I think I could generate more drying power if I could find someone to blow through a straw.
1,conair hair dryer disappointing,"The picture of this product makes it appear as if the hair bonnet and attachments are contained in an easy to use case. But what you don't know is that the bonnet, hose and attachemnts are tightly stuffed inside a tiny opening in the side of the plastic case. It was challenging to remove the bonnet,hose and attachemtns. I gave up in frustration trying to squeeze them back in. The bonnet is too small, difficult to fit over even medium rollers. The air flow is inefficeint in drying the hair, taking a long time to do the job. I was quite disappointed in this product."
4,satisfied,"Although this product is not all that I would like it to be, it is closer than anything I had been able to find locally, and find that this is true with almost anything I buy now. However, I will say the delivery was prompt and packaging was very good. I would have no hesitation about buying again from this seller."
2,Broke after short use,I was originally happy with this product. I didn't use it that often but it worked well. Then it just stopped working. It certainly didn't last as long as a hand-held blow dryer. I was disappointed.
4,My mom wanted one!,"I got this as a gift for my Mom for Christmas...it's what she wanted! Anyway, I have noticed her hair looking more full lately. And she absolutely loves the stupid thing! My sister and I got a big laugh out of it when she asked for it, but what Mom wants Mom gets!"
4,Harman Kardon AVR500,"I have owned this reciever for 6mo and love the quality of sound it produces. It performes equally well in both stereo and cinema modes. my reciever was one of the early serial numbers so I have had to have the volume control replaced, eratic volume control was a problem on the first AVR500's. This reciever is very flexible with many analog, digital, coax, and s-video plugs. I would have given this reciever a 5 Star rating if I didn't have to have it in the shop for a month!"
1,Not what I expected,Here's an example of two pages:Page 12 I love you but ... We only do things your way.Page 13 Please God ... I give in so often when I know I shouldn't. Please give me strength and guidance.That is EVERYTHING on the pages. All the others are similar.
4,Not To Bad...,"Another anime that I had trouble getting into. Not a bad anime but I really sort of lost interest after the first few episodes. It was a good buy however and it really sort helped my collection. This, however, was one of those I watched and just wouldn't latch unto."
5,Thank You!,Thank you Rev. Stewart for writing this book. I have read it several times and it has given me great inspiration.
4,Interesting Take,"OK, it's no substitute for the actual albums, but the Boreades de Montreal find some interesting new things in arranging the music this way. Recommended."
3,George Harrison,"I don't listen to classical music with any regularity, but I liked piggies, and Eleanor Rigby. George Harrison has always had a wide range of of musical talent, and I enjoyed the CD."
4,reviewed but not used much yet,we have used this in a limited way only because we have not yet been out in the field much
5,Great reading for non-fungiphiles and shroomheads alike!,"This guide is a gem, covering everything from recipies to cultural attitudes and blurbs of short fiction (intentionally or not, the stories are hilarious), all of which is sandwitched into an information packed, full color photo format replete with every prominant mushroom you want to identify. All fits in your pocket, too."
5,great book,This author has a great presentation. Both of his mushroom books are great and to have one that is really nice to carry around is wonderful. The seller was easy and fast to use. The book is in perfect condition. No complaints.
5,A funny guide,"All That the Rain Promises, and More ...: A Hip Pocket Guide to Western MushroomsThis is a very informative book for many of the mushrooms of the Pacific Coast. Some of the pages contain stories of mushroomer's adventures and recipes. My only problem with the book is that there are not as many different types listed as I hoped. I am in an area where there are many different mushrooms, and I'm still looking for a book that identifies them! But, it is a very good, easy to understand book."
5,All that the rain promises and more,"Very good descriptions and pictures. More than just a guide book, also interesting and funny stories. In all an excellent book."
5,my husband LOVES this book,"This is a very informative but still fun guide to western mushrooms. I bought it because my husband borrowed it from a friend, then promptly lost it, so we had to replace it. Now my husband wants me to order another one for himself."
5,Wonderful color pictures,"This dandy little paperback is full of color photographs as well as very vivid descriptions, from immature to mature specimens. Makes hunting for the edible fungi easy and lots of fun. This should be used as a companion piece to the MUSHROOMS DEMYSTIFIED and can be kept right in your pack in the field!"
5,Fungus Amoung Us,"This is an excellent book for people just beginning their journey into mushroom adoration. It is simple, colorful and filled with hilarious stories about people and the mushrooms that they find. Once you have become familiar with this book, Mushrooms Demystified, also by David Arora, is a natural and recommended progression."
3,My kid isn't a fan,"I was very excited to buy these feeders because my 6 month old really likes to feed herself. My goal was to be able to give her some foods that she couldn't otherwise have (because of choking hazard) in these feeders. I tried blueberries and she was not into it. In fact, she just looked at it in disgust and didn't even bite down. I guess she wasn't a fan of the taste of the mesh fabric.I am going to keep trying, but as of now, my kid isn't a fan."
3,Hard to assemble,I couldn't get the top off to put in the fruit/food. I even bought the extra mesh bags...never could get the mesh bag off...had to return the product.
2,"Nets are not removable, difficult to clean","These mesh feeders are messy, but there is no way to feed a 6 month old that isn't. I ended up throwing these out after I was unable to completely clean banana from the nets. I replaced the Munchkin brand mesh feeder with the Sassy brand. The nets are removable, thus cleanable! Sassy also sells replacement nets."
2,Not his favorite,My son didn't like this very much. It seemed very cumbersome to put a piece of fruit into the net. Often times the fruit would be too small and it moves around in the net too much and hard for the baby to eat it or the fruit would be too large and it won't fit into the net. I almost have to cut it up perfectly so it's snug and baby can get to it easier.
5,Fresh Food Feeder for babies,"This is a great product! My 9 month old was teething, and the typical gel filled teething rings and other things of this nature were not working, and he didn't like these.I bought the Munchkin Fresh Food Feeder and, he loves these! And with these I can put fresh fruit or vegetables in the net part of this which locks down to prevent choking, and he is getting fresh fruits, vegetables ect. These are also top rack dishwasher safe so, can be reused.Munchkin Fresh Food Feeder 2 Pack"
2,very difficult to clean,"Good concept, but very messy...not only when the baby is sucking on it, but afterwards, trying to clean it is a nightmare..I tried it with fresh banana today for the first time, and spent over half an hour trying to scrub out the fiber! Not very practical..."
4,I wrote more reviews on WhenKidsRock.com,"Have you ever want to give your child new food but you are scared that they might choke? Or has your child ever been teething so bad that they're in so much pain and Baby Orajel doesn't help the pain? Well, the Fresh Food Feeder by Munchkin will solve your problem. You can give your fresh frozen fruit or vegetable to try or place ice in it to use for teething. The mesh bag will prevent your baby from taking pieces of food too large where they can choke. You don't have to worry about your child taking the feeder apart too as it's pretty sturdy once you lock the ring to the mesh bag. Why use Baby Orajel when you can use something more healthier or fresher.The only downside to this product is the cleaning. While it's great for feeding your child, food can get stuck in the mesh holes. It can get a little tricky to clean it out."
2,My baby won't use this,"I've tried offering this to my baby several times beginning at 6 months. She is now 9.5 months and still won't use it. I put banana in it, her favorite food and try to show her how to use it to eat it. But she is just not interested. She didn't even really want to play with it as a toy. Also the price they are charging here is too high. I found it for several dollars less at Target."
3,Nice idea but quite messsy,"This seemed to be a great idea, and it's true that my six-month old immediately understood the purpose of them and quite avidly started to suck on the little mesh bag as soon as I handed it to her with a little piece of banana in it, but soon she was completely covered with sticky banana goo, from her face, to her little hands, to her entire dress. After three or four of these episodes I've stopped using them because of the clean-up job that inevitably followed each snack. It's a nice idea, but not ideal because of the messiness of it."
3,Hard to Clean,"I've only used these once for my sons, but they are not worth the headache. I knew they'd be messy as they ate with them and I was okay with that. However cleaning the netting was impossible. I put a piece of banana in the netting for them to chew on. The reviews show that banana is one of the messier fruits to clean, but I didn't read the reviews prior to using the product. The banana is impossible to clean. I scrubbed that netting until I thought it would rip. Then I put them through the dishwasher and they are still disgusting. They still smell like banana and when I picked the netting up off the counter, a fruit fly flew out. These are obviously not clean despite my best attempt to clean them. Unless you have enough money to buy several netting replacements, this isn't the best product. I will try other fruits, but if a dishwasher doesn't get the netting clean it seems like not a great product."
5,Loved them.,"I have twin girls and these worked very well. The girls liked eating oranges and other soft fruit through them. They are a little messy but worth it!! Also, put some crushed ice in them when your baby is teething. This works like a charm. Good luck mommies!"
4,excellent,my grand daughter loved it. It was a little hard to keep it clean. But I will be using this product with all of my other grandbabies from 4 months and up. I would recommend this product.
2,Hard to clean and messy,"I gave my 6 month old some frozen sweet potatoe in this but she was more interested in chewing on the handle, it made a mess and was very difficult to clean. I will follow suggestion of other reviewers andwary again when she is 9 months. Tho I don't know what I'll do about the cleaning mesh problem."
3,Very difficult to open,"I had some of these when my first child was younger, so I purchased another set for the second child. My set was exceedingly difficult to open. Now, I realize that is the point, but I barely used them because they were so hard. Little one did love to chew on an apple slice or carrot when he used these, though."
4,A MUST HAVE,"GREAT! BUT STILL MESSY BUT IT SURE HELPS A BABY ONCE HE OR SHE IS STARTING TO HOLD THINGS! A MUST HAVE,.."
1,Disappointed,"I agree with others who say this is impossible to clean. I used it with grapes, no problem. I then tried bananas and literally can't get it clean. I hand washed it, then stuck it in my dishwasher inside-out. Still not clean. There are black pieces of banana stuck in the mesh. I threw it away. With the remaining feeder (it came in a 2-pack) I guess I'll stick to grapes, apples, pears. Definitely no bananas. What a disappointment. Would never recommend this product."
1,Impossible to clean,I bought 4 of these for my son who is teething. He loves them but it takes me 20+ minutes to clean out the cracks. Then I go to get one to put some food in it and I STILL find little food particles in there. I was concerned because of that and threw them all away.
1,Good idea. VERY hard to clean.,"Our son liked squishing banana out of this, however it only gets one star since it's impossible to clean quickly. Baby products must be easy to clean fully or they don't get used. Preferably they should easy to take apart and load in the dishwasher. I stood over the sink for 10 minutes plucking banana fibers from the mesh. That's a nightmare scenario for a baby feeding tool."
1,Yuck!,"Okay, anyone that comes to my house will quickly see, I'm not a neat freak. Not in the slightest. These were so messy! I know, I know. It's kindda the deal, but I just didn't realize how big a mess it made. Plus, stinker just didn't get into it. He'd rather mash it into the floor than suck on it. Maybe he was too little? Dunno. But these are going in the trash. They just seem like a good place for germies to live. I couldn't really get them clean. Seemed like they always had a little old food living in them. Kindda like a old kitchen dish cloth. Bleh!"
4,Mine Baby loves it,My baby loves eating from these. Here is how we clean it: open it up and turn the mesh inside out and hang it over a tine in the dishwasher.
5,Must have item!!!,I just ordered 2 more of these for my 8 month old. I use them all the time. I keep one in the diaper bag to use at restaurants and many more places. She loves using them. She gets excited every time she sees these. I put fruit and vegetables in them and they are a big hit. I would definitely recommend these to others.
4,Love to use it...Hate to clean it.,"My son loves using this for fruits, especially bananas, oranges, and peaches. It's easy for him to hold and feed himself and I don't have to worry about him choking.The opening is a bit small for inserting the fruit, even small banana is too wide and must be split in half. I also find it incredibly difficult to clean all the way.All in all, I would still recommend this product because my son loves it so much and it promotes his independence."
4,LOVE it but how do you clean it?,"My son LOVE LOVE LOVES these! But WOW are they messy. I've thrown two away because I can't get the banana mush out of them. Any tips? I've put it through the dishwasher a number of times and tried to scrub it out with a brush. If I have to buy and toss, I will because they're that great but there has to be someway to clean these things."
3,love it but HARD to open,like this product but very difficult to open. i open with my teeth and will probably bust a tooth trying to get it to open. i do not recommend the product based on the difficulty to open. i already lost one in the house... somewhere. they are great for the baby to suck on tho and my little guy (4 mos) CAN hold this on his own which is a plus.
2,It has potential,"I bought this product for my daughter when she was younger. At first, it seemed like the greatest thing every. She was able to gum on all kinds of fruit and some freshly cooked meats.After a few uses, I decided that they were not worth the money. My daughter loved having strawberries in this product. However, the strawberries are extremely difficult to clean out of the mesh. After about 4 washes, one of the meshes started to tear apart.This product is a good idea, however I will wait for improvements before buying again for myself or a friend."
2,Mesh Not Replaceable,"This worked pretty well the first time with my 6.5 month old - he seemed to like it and was able to get a fair amount of banana through it. However, the mesh nets are not replaceable on this brand, unlike on some of the other brands (Sassy, Nuby, and BabySafe feeders). This is a major problem because eventually you will want to replace the net. It is just too hard to clean out all the goo since the net is permanent. I attempted to detach the net by pulling out the little plastic locking ring, but now it won't reattach fully. I think you're better off with one of the replaceable net systems. Also, a cap would be nice for on-the-go."
1,"Yuck, what a mess and not worth the trouble!",I tried this product with my first daughter & thought it was a fabulous idea. The feeder is a pain to clean & a mess when juice from produce collects. Just give your child a sugar free popsicle or spoon & bowl or let them dig in to the snack with their gums/teeth and fingers. Lesson learned.
2,Really suck to clean,"I was so paranoid about my first child choking to death, we got these but eesh. So not worth the trouble. I'd rather just sit and watch him eat than mess with the half hour of trying to clean these things out. Think the dishwasher would do it? Nope. Don't waste your money, these suck."
1,Better Brands Out There,"This is by far the worst feeder bag on the market. It is impossible to clean, unlike the brands where the bag can be removed. Try the Kid Co. Baby Steps. The bags can be removed for thorough cleaning which means you can buy new ones if they start to look worn. Feeders are a great idea to introduce new flavors to babies without the risk of choking. You can also make cold ""teethers"" with frozen breastmilk. Highly recomended, just not this brand."
3,"Love the concept, tricky to clean","I love the idea of this. It's a great way to introduce more solids to your child without the constant worry of choking. However, my little one never took to it. The holes are small (by design obviously) but very little food actually gets out without really working at it. The food that does come out it very tricky to clean out once you are done and the mesh seems to get clogged. I'm going to try these again with our next baby to see if maybe my son just didn't like this because I really like the concept."
3,caused a rash on my son face,my son suffer from excema and i noticed everytime i use it my son had a flare-up. Not sure if its from the material its made out of.
2,child wont use it,my son would not use this. i'm assuming it's the texture of the mesh he doesnt like. he liked chewing on the handle more.
1,"Great idea, but VERY difficult to clean","I bought this because I thought it would be great for my daughter to be able to feed herself frozen bananas. She really didn't like using it, but my issue with it is really trying to clean it. After she was done, banana was in the seams of the cloth...it took forever to clean!! I haven't used it again because I'm not 100% that all of the banana actually came out."
2,Hard to open and close,"Found it hard to open and close. I know it's not supposed to open easily fort safety, but thought it could be designed better. Other companies make these so I would suggest trying one of those."
1,Impossible to clean - Mesh always had food bits in it,"While initially we loved this product (our 7 month old went to town on some orange and banana), we have now thrown all of ours away.Put simply, we could not get them clean. I soaked them. Washed them. Scrubbed them. Put them in the dishwasher. All for naught.Tiny bits of food particles still clung to the inside of the mesh. Gah.The amount of time I've spent trying to get these suckers clean just isn't worth it. Good luck."
4,"Great concept, but Baby didn't like it.","Great idea, but my son hated it! He didn't like the mesh texture over his banana. He simply just wanted to eat the banana. LOL This concept is great, but if you have a picky eater than this will not work. Go ahead and try this product because your baby might like it! My rating is based on the concept not usage."
3,Just OK,"My son, 7 months-old, did not really like these feeders. He has no problem holding them and putting them in his mouth, but the 'juices' from foods don't really taste good I guess. He tried 3 times and is no longer interested."
3,Product is good but my baby boy doesn't like it,My son preferred to bite and suck from fresh fruit than from using this product because I think juice didn't come so much.
4,great for teething,"I love these for when your baby is teething--put in an ice cube, and it's an instant fix! Even my older daughter liked them as an 'ice pop' when the weather was hot. They are kind of a pain to clean if you put something like apple or peach in them. But my baby has also gotten tons of use out of it that way, so definitely recommended."
3,"Hard to clean, but good to have on hand","This product is a can't-live-without product in my opinion. It's convenient and a great transition to finger food. I just put my mesh feeders in the washing machine with a load and use some plant-based detergent. It gets all the food out of the fibers. I actually prefer the Sassy mesh feeder, since it has a cover and an ice pack in the handle. But, these are great for using at home, and the mesh doesn't discolor like Sassy's."
1,they are too hard to clean,"These NEVER comeclean. Scrubbing, dishwasher etc. nothing works. The Sassy teethers with the removeable and replacement bags are much better."
1,Useless and impractical,"I bought this thinking that baby will have a way to feed himself because he wants to eat/drink by himself. What I got was a horrible mess, food allover bay's hands ( I could have left him with some babana puree to figure it out with the same results). A royal pain to clean it as well. Will put it in the trash."
3,BPA? - Be Careful!,"Thank goodness for California's Prop 65! I wasn't sure if this was safe for my little one, but after looking it up I found out it might not be. Phew!"
1,Not impressed at all,"Great concept, but I do not like these. They are hard to open (which I realize is good for the child, but I still don't like it) as well as near impossible to really clean."
2,Not the best,"Things I liked about the feeders:1. My daughter enjoyed feeding herself2. Feeders could be refrigerated with the food inside to use while baby was teethingThings I disliked:1. Hard to clean (pieces of food would stick to the inside of the mesh despite hand washing and dishwashing)2. Pieces of the mesh would come off in baby's mouth (the inside seams are loose making it easy for the mesh to come apart)3. Messy (food slobber would drip down my daugther's mouth and get everywhere, making for more cleanup than finger feeding)"
1,Buy Sassy's version - so much easier to clean!,"It took over 30 minutes of non-stop scrubbing and rinsing to clean remnants of banana from the non-removable mesh on this teether-feeder by Munchkin and later I noticed additional spots which needed more scrubbing. The way Munchkin's mesh pouch is attached to the plastic makes it very difficult to clean that top edge of the mesh. Someone recommended I try the Sassy teething feeder (also available through Amazon)which has a removable pouch, and it only took a few minutes to thoroughly clean it of all traces on smashed banana. Now the munchkin feeders, both the one I had used and the unused (from the twin pack) are going into the trash!"
3,hard to clean,"I did use them several times but find myself using them less and less. They are very hard to clean and create a lot of mess. However, design wise, they are very comfortable for a baby. He was able to hold them easily."
2,Hard to clean,"These are good in theory, but I found them difficult to clean. Food would get into the hinge, and stuck in the mesh. I found it was easier just to serve chunky purees with a spoon. This is a great way to introduce independent feeding."
2,Awful for bananas.,These things turn into awful black mold factories if you put bananas in them. You literally cannot get out the black old food stuffs. No washing will cleans these. Try the plastic versions.
1,good for one use,"This worked alright for one use. I fed my baby a banana and he seemed to enjoy it and did okay with it. Unfortunately, no amount of washing by hand or in the dishwasher will remove the banana remnants caught in the net. I had to throw it away."
2,Useful but extremely hard to clean,"My infant son loves eating grapes and other small foods with this product, plus he likes to chew the teething ring handle. However, it takes me so long to clean it, I'm ready to throw it away. I even tried to wash it in the dishwasher and there was still food stuck in the seams, soI had to spend another 10 minutes trying to get more pieces out. If you do get this feeder, I highly recommend NOT using it for bananas, then you will spend about 30 minutes cleaning it out!"
3,"Good idea, needs some improvement","I really like the concept, however, I think the release of this item was premature. The mesh pocket should be seamless for easier washing. Also, it isn't travel friendly; it needs a snap-on cover to make it more portable."
3,Awesome product...but maybe for single use.,After 2 or 3 uses i usually toss out and replace because doesn't seem very sanitary. Other brands have the mesh as replaceable so seems like a better idea.
5,"Great for teething baby, just add ice cubes",Once my son started on solids we were excited to bust these out. We put fresh fruits in them especially in these summer months. Also since my son is teething we pop in a few ice cubes and instant teether. They are easy for him to hold on to as well.
4,"Not exactly a ""feeder,"" but useful","We like this and use it a lot. The only problem with it is that the mesh is so fine that all that comes through is the juice. I thought the mesh would be a bit looser so that as the baby chewed on it, little bits of food would come through. So it's more of a tasty toy than a ""feeder,"" but it does keep him happy while I'm cooking dinner. I plan to let him chomp on some frozen fruit cubes when he's teething!"
2,well made but unnecessary,"As a first-time mom I was paranoid about my child choking on things, so I thought this would be the answer. Well, my daughter only chewed on the handle, so it didn't work as a feeder.As time went by and I have learned about babies learning to eat, my fears about choking have been alleviated and I have found that this is a totally unnecessary item. We still have them kicking around from our firstborn, but haven't used them with our second child.Sit them upright (no leaning back at all) and let them chew and try things. Save your money on these and buy a good board book to read together instead."
4,Great for teething,"I used these to put ice cubes in when my little one was teething, never actually put food in them so I can't attest to how well they work for the intended purpose thus my only giving this product 4 stars."
2,"Neat idea, not for fruit however","These are a brilliant concept but a poor execution. I bought these for my teething 5 month old, and threw in some banana pieces. Bad idea. These things are impossible to clean, food gets stuck everywhere. I tried cold mango too, same results- 3 times through the dishwasher, soaking and scrubbing cannot remove all the food bits. And I'm not super paranoid about germs, but that just seems unsanitary. Another brand recommended cleaning with warm water, vinegar, and alka seltzer, so I'll be trying that- but in the meantime, will NOT be putting fresh fruit in these.That being said, I do make and freeze my own baby food, and a cube of that is messy but provides neater cleanup of the product, so it's not a total loss.Will I buy these for my next baby? God no. Not untill the design is revamped and I don't have to spend hours picking little banana bits out of the seams."
2,baby won't use,"Haven't been able to get my 8 month old to use these. Have been trying for a few months. Love the idea, but she won't touch them. I tried them too, and can't blame her. The taste and feel of the mesh is not very pleasant."
5,Best for letting baby feed himself,"LOVE THIS! I think anything that could easily squish thru you should freeze then put in the feeder. One reviewer said the banana was hard to clean, but I've only put frozen bananas inside (which my son LOVED on the first try) and I did not have a hard time cleaning it up. All in all great product -- remember to freeze the squishy stuff!"
3,Weigh convenience against cleaning hassle,"Best for: holding an ice cube to soothe a teething baby or as a baby-popsicle option for summer, watermelon chunks, frozen peas, etc, for when you want the baby happily occupied with tasting and soothing.Next best for: feeding a baby banana or avocado or mashed sweet potato when you want them to feed themselves so you can have your hands free, IF you don't mind the incredible mess the squished-through avocado or banana will make all over baby and high chair, and IF you can clean it out immediately after. The little fibers can get stuck in the mesh, so prompt cleaning is essential.Not a replacement for spoon-feeding, but will keep them happy in a high chair, without choke hazards, til you get dinner finished."
2,meh,I LOVE the idea of this product but the material makes it very difficult to clean out. My son loves chewing on cold peaches and bananas etc but no matter what we have tried they all mash into the netting making it a 25 minutes task of scrapping it clean with my fingernails and a pipe cleaner. I threw them out after 2 washes from frustration.
1,Yuck in a sack,"I knew several people that used these and loved them, but they were more of a hassle for me. I put in a few different foods to try and all of it ended up being mush in a sack.My daughter would try it, lick it then toss it on the floor where it would squish all over the place. And don't get me started with cleaning this nasty thing. GROSS!In theory the feeder sounds great but functionally its gross and traps food in places. blah! :("
1,Can't even get it open!,My husband and I both tried and tried - it was impossible. Now it's become a chew toy without anything inside to chew. Oh well.
3,Good concept but messy,"This is a good idea to give to your teething little one, but anything you put in there will make a huge mess and get it all over what seems like everything except in your little ones mouth."
4,Great for Teething,We liked to use it for my daughter when she was teething. We would put foods like strawberries or melon in it. She loved it. I liked that the latch closed tight so she couldn't open it but sometimes it was hard to open.
1,impossible to clean,"We received a set of these as a gift and began feeding banana pieces to our daughter (in the little mesh baggie) when she was about 8 months old. She seemed to enjoy squeezing the banana out through the bag and was eating the majority of what we gave her, but the mesh is impossible to clean. We ultimately threw these out because we could not get food particles out of the things. This is the second disappointing food-related product we've gotten from Munchkin (snack catcher is the other one). Cannot recommend this."
4,Great for curious babies,Great product just never put banana in as you can never get it cleaned out. We also used it with ice cubes when our son was teething.
3,Really HARD to open!,"I broke part of my nail off trying to pry this thing open. I wish the net was a screw on attachment. However, it's a great product, perfect my little teething baby. Just be sure to have a bib and wash cloth handy because it gets messy fast!"
3,"fine product, a little hard to clean","We've were fairly happy with this. The little one didn't use it for long. The only draw back to it is that it was hard to get it *really* clean. Goo would end up in the parts where the mesh bag's hem folded over, and where it connected in the hard plastic base."
3,my baby did not like it.,this is a neat item! i was so excited when i saw it. but my son did not like the texture of the mesh part.
2,Hard to clean,It worked well with a bananna and our 7-month-old son seemed to enjoy it. The problem came when it was time to clean up. Little bits of bananna got stuck in the netting and in the seam where the netting meets the plastic ring. 5 minutes of scrubbing under warm water and I was still finding bits of bananna stuck in there. Not worth the effort.
5,fresh foods and convenience,"This is an incredibly useful product. We use it with our 7 month old, and he can feed himself fresh fruit and vegetables. Apples and pears work best. Carrots give him something to chew on, but he doesn't get very far. Bananas are his favorite, though they are the messiest and hardest to clean up--the riper the banana the easier it is to clean the mesh. The nicest part is that he feeds himself! One tip: we use a pacifier clip to keep him from throwing it on the floor."
3,Pretty good but hard to clean,"I think this is a great concept but I find it very hard to clean. Banana is almost impossible to get out. All the fibers of the banana get stuck in the seams and it is so hard to get out. I ended up cutting the extra mesh around the seam hoping it would help a little. I put them in the dishwasher, use a scrub brush, etc but there's always something left. And then it gets dried up in the mesh and flakes off but is still stuck in those darn seams! Maybe I just need to use firmer fruits and veggies and leave the banana for finger food.Kind of a hassle but baby loves it and I can give her a little ""appetizer"" while I am getting her meals ready."
1,Sheds Plastic,"We had misgivings about letting our baby chew one of these, but we finally gave him some apple in the Munchkin feeder. When we removed the apple from the mesh bag (when he was finished), we noticed pieces of blue plastic embedded in the apple! The pieces were small enough that they could have gone through the mesh. I don't know how much plastic our baby ate, but we certainly won't be using these anymore!! Unsafe at best."
3,too risky,"The concept of these feeders is just genius, and I was very pleased the first few times I gave my son some fruit in them. He caught right on and seemed to love sucking and chewing on it, too.But when I came on to write a good review for them, and saw all the comments about plastic chemicals and fibers coming loose, I was very disappointed.Sadly, they went into the trash that day. I really don't want to take any risks with my baby. Maybe Ill try another brand."
3,Not as handy as I thought,"For us this is only ""ok"" 3 stars. There wasn't really any instructions for cleaning, dishwasher safe yes but that doesn't make it clean. I am bummed as well that these don't have replacement bags. At least then I would know it was clean. We do avocado and bananas in these and it take a LOT of time to get out all the mush. I tried by hand, dishwasher, and boiling. It takes a lot of hand washing to get all the mush out of the mesh seams inside the bag. Now they just sit in the drawer and I spoon feed instead. Not at all the handy item I thought they would be. Since all the free time I earn by letting my baby snack with out me is lost in the 20 minutes of rinsing and washing. If you know how to get them clean I would love to know, and would happily change my review."
4,Smart and useful product,"I purchased a set of the Munchkin feeders for my granddaughter (age 8 months). They work really well, and she enjoys holding her own food and chewing and sucking on it. It can be messy (what isn't when baby feeds self!). It is easy to clean if you clean immediately. If you wait, it can be very difficult to clean.Why didn't I think of this?"
4,nice for on the go,"It perfect for traveling or to pack something for a walk. I don't use it too much as directed, I tend to freeze the food before putting it in there and use it more as a teether. It is messy but totally worth the mess because my daughter loves it."
2,Great concept,"This is a great concept but by the time my kid could chew the food through, he developed teeth to chew through the mesh. This was fun because it helped us experiment, but it was better to mash the food in a bowl and serve with a spoon. I wouldn't recommend to anyone honestly. It was a great concept and had potential, but falls short in my opinion."
2,Would YOU want to eat week-old banana?,"I have hand scrubbed, machine sanitized and stood over the sink picking tiny pieces of week old banana out of the folds of mesh on this thing. Still not really clean. I could give it to the baby. But in the back of my mind, I'd wonder if some food borne bacteria has made it's way into my little man's food. Not worth it."
2,baby doesn't like it,"good idea but my baby doesn't like it ~and it's very hard to clean,hard to open,i think i'll not buy it again~"
2,good idea but baby hated it,"good idea but my baby hated the net. It is also very messy. Also, it was a little overpriced online compared to instore prices."
1,Can't get it clean,"I have a couple of these that I'm about to throw away. The concept is great, but food gets stuck along the seems and I can't get it clean. I have to soak and scrub and then soak and scrub again. The product says it's dishwasher safe, but it does not get clean at all. Other companies make a similar product. Don't buy these!"
4,Best to get two!,"I love this product! It is best to get two! Haveing the little girl I got the Pinkish and Yellow one. My only complaint is that when used with Bananas it is super hard to clean, and if not cleaned out ASAP it stains! Other wize I would have given this product full stars. Honestly wish I would have thought of this product!"
3,"Great concept, hard to clean","We got these as a shower gift and they worked well in the early days of introducing solids. They do create a bit of a sticky mess as the food mushes out of them. I'd like to see them with shorter bags as the food tended to move towards the base and baby girl lost interest as she had nothing but the mesh in her mouth unless I squished the food forward again. I still haven't found a good way to clean them. I thought the bags were removable, but that doesn't seem to be the case."
5,Great Invention!,My 6-month old son doesn't like the taste of banana (mashed)...we tried to feed him bananas using the munchkin fresh food feeder and he liked chewing on it in an instant. I also love that the small round handle fits in his little hands perfectly and it keeps the food chunks securely locked inside.
2,Too hard to clean,"I saw the rave reviews, and liked that I wouldn't have to worry about my 6-month-old daughter choking. I've used it once, and I've decided I don't like it. The baby really enjoyed chewing on it, but the stupid thing is impossible to clean. I still can't get the pieces of banana out, no matter what I try. It's not worth the hassle. I'll just stick to tiny cut-up pieces of soft food, and let her feed herself that way."
2,"Easy to use, impossible to clean","My son LOVED eating out of these. We tried oatmeal, bananas, and apple. However I was never able to fully clean the mesh, which is not removable, despite considerable effort. That, unfortunately, makes them pretty useless. I also have concerns what kind of dye was used to color the mesh. There are several similar products where the mesh is removable. I'll try one of those out next."
1,pointless,we got this as an introduction to fruits for our 18 month old but he doesen't like it hes weird out about it and rather eat the fruits alone then use this ....it was pointless to buy it because hes never wanted to use it totally afraid of it.
1,my kid hates these,my daughter hates these and wanted nothing to do with them! they are not easy to clean either and your options are pretty limited as to what you can put in them. bananas are pretty much the only thing that makes sense to put in these feeders. the netting was a huge turn off to my daughter. i don't blame her. the texture of the netting is not appetizing and would deter me to eat from it as well.
2,Good idea but mesh material is not as good as I expected,"I thought it's a good idea to introduce finger food to my baby by starting with this fruit feeder. However,the material of the mesh was not soft enough (at least for my baby) and kind of hard for the little one to take a bite. He only put it into his mouth once and never wanted it again. I still give it two stars because he still play with it sometime and will chew on the holder part of it as a teather, so two stars for being a teether instead of a complete waste."
3,Great concept but there are better versions,"We have both the Munchkin version of this product and another version that's teal and white colored, made by Sassy(?). My 8 month old enjoys using both equally, and they've been great for teething and learning to self-feed without fear of choking. I prefer the other design over this Munchkin brand however, becuase the screw-off design of the other ones is easier to use than the pinch & open hinge design of these. It makes loading and cleaning easier, and I also like that the other ones have removable and replacable mesh bags. Less plastic waste."
4,Nice little gadget!,"Very good idea,I do like it and I take them with me when we are travel or in the restaurant.But there is one thing I don't like is they don't give you chance to choice color.I have a baby boy and received one purple color one green color,so when ever we go out I will have to leave the purple color at home,It would be nice if the color is same as the picture or you can choice the color,so I will have one for back up."
1,Completely Different Color,I ordered what was displayed in the picture I received the PINK color! This is not acceptable as this is intended for a baby boy.
3,Dream on me baby bath seat,"Its an ok purchase. My son is really active baby and he is moving in it a lot. After I get him out the seat, after bath, his chest and back has red marks all over it. I wish they made it more like softer or something, so kids would not hurt themselves. :("
2,Mess-O-Rama,"The idea sounds great but it is not very functional. I used this product a few times when my daughter was first eating real food, and it made a big mess. I put banana and avacado in the mesh baggie, and I could never get the mesh clean. Food stays in it and gets nasty, you cannot get the food out of the mesh. Bits of food stay in the mesh FOREVER. You'd be better off just spoon feeding little bits of already mashed food and save yourself the cleaning."
3,Fresh Food Feeder,The first time I gave this to my daughter she went to town on it. However they are really hard to get clean. But after that first time my daughter wouldn't take them anymore. She would play with them but would not actually chew on them. I tried lots of different fruits to put in them. If she would have used them each time it would of been worth buying them and cleaning them.
4,Mesh feeder,"These are great for little ones starting out and for teething.I've put grapes in these so my lil guy could suck/chew on them but not choke. The feeders are great for ice cubes too- that way your lil one can soothe painful gums while teething and ""slurp"" on the water too. If you're brave you could make juice pops but be prepared for the mess! ;)"
2,Much better ones available!,"I have three of the Munchkin Fresh Food FeedersMunchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Varythat I purchased to use when our first baby started asking to eat solids (there were no silicone versions at the time). They worked beautifully, but were a bear to get clean. The fabric mesh holds food particulate in the seams that was nigh impossible to remove completely.Enter the Clevafeed.Clevamama ClevafeedI love the silicone bag of the Clevafeed! This eliminates the food-buildup issue of the older style and is so easy to clean and sanitize. The silicone bag is also completely removable so that every little nook can be completely cleaned. Awesome! The original concept that allows and encourages babies to start trying solid foods in an improved and easy to clean design. I will buy more of these!Thanks for reading, I hope this review was helpful!"
1,really can't get them clean,"I was another one who thought others were just whining about the cleaning and bought them any way. Used them once, gave it about 10 minutes of my time trying to clean them and then threw them away. Waste of money. You would have to hand pick every tiny particle out of it to be able to use it again. Can't think of many parents of six month old kids that have time to do that!"
1,Gave my baby atopic dermatitis around his mouth,"After using this twice for about 10 minutes each time, my baby had an awful rash all around his mouth. We identified the rash as atopic dermatitis and set about identifying the offensive item that was setting him off... After a few weeks of eliminating foods and other things, we figured out this was the culprit. Too bad because it's such a great tool."
1,feeder falls apart...be warned!,"I didn't buy our mesh feeder from here, but did want to write a review somewhere to warn other parents. The pin in the hinge falls out after a few months of use, at least. I kept trying to jam it back in and it kept falling apart as our child used it. I turned around 2 days ago and he had the pin and both pieces of the feeder in his hands. The pin is a plastic long piece that could cause a choking hazard. Be warned to not buy this particular feeder. I am trying to find the company's website to write to them about the issues. Our son loved using the feeder so I am going to find another brand that is safer."
2,"Great idea, but awful to clean","We have twins and this product is great, or so we thought. Keeps both babies occupied for 20-30 mins, which is a lifesaver for us! The greatest drawback, like most reviewers is it is the pits to clean! After one session of banana, hard scrubbing by mom, a run through the dishwasher by dad, and now we're soaking in some heavy duty oxy type cleaner.....they're still not clean!!!You've got to be kidding me! This product needs a serious rethink. Parents, especially parents of mulitples can not spend their day scrubbing this product clean.It is great in concept, but horrible for real life use! I'm glad we received these as a gift, because I won't be buying them again, life is too short!"
3,Good in theory,"I tried to put frozen grapes or strawberries in here for my teething daughter... I liked the idea of the cold to soothe her gums and also adding some fruit to her diet without the choking hazard. Unfortunately, the netting is so thick, none of the juice made it to her mouth, so she was essentially sucking on a cold net. As you might imagine, she lost interest in this ""treat"" very quickly."
4,frozen treat........,"I used one of these with my first grandaughter. Messy (what little one isn't) but worth it. We used pieces of juicepops, strawberries, bananas. She love it. My second grandaughter is slowly warming up to it."
3,Must clean with toothbrush,"My baby likes to eat peach and banana with this, as she can self-feed. Mommy also likes the convenience on-the-go. However, the gunk that's stuck does not come out after hand-washing or soaking in hot water. I finally used a toothbrush to clean it after finding some yucky black stuff (gasp) still stuck under the fold of the seam. That's quite a bit of work and uses a LOT of water to wash. In the next iteration please make it so that the mesh bag can be removed and laid flat to scrub and seam-less."
1,No good for my Baby,"I have tried to give this to my friends babies and they rejected it. Then I tried it for my baby she rejected it too. I tried this product it multiple times with multiple options - with ice in it, strawberries in it, or banana or carrot in it. Nothing attracted her to use it.Completely rejected to eat from it. I guess taste and Texture of mesh was little weird for her.Anyway didn't work out for us."
2,Good idea but hard to clean,"It was great to use and my son loved frozen fruit in it. Wow, it was impossible to clean so I threw it in the trash.Nuby 2-Pack Nibbleris easier to clean and you can replace the mesh if you need to."
3,Great idea but bags should come out,"I love using these things with some food for my 8 month old. It keeps her busy and she loves it. I use banana often and the banana sticks to the bag and makes a huge mess for cleaning. The bag is ruined and since you cannot remove the bag, I had to throw away the whole thing. I recommend the ones where you can remove the bag. These are a waste otherwise!"
5,Mesh Feeders,"These are awesome! I agree with everyone else that the bananas are the worse to clean, but it's my son's favorite."
5,The best book I have read in years!!!,"This book is a must read! It is an exciting and intriguingcoming of age novel. A fifteen year old daughter of friends said""I can't believe a man wrote this, he understands what it's like to be a fifteen year old girl so well."" Mr. Rayfiel not only creates a realistic character within a truly bizarre plot, he even makes us believe that it is completely natural to fall in love with both a father and his son. I loved this book and recommend it highly to everyone!"
4,"An expensive product, but looks nice in the nursery","If we only had one window in the babies room I wouldn't complain, but with 2 windows at [the price]!! Needless to say, we bought them anyway and they make the room look nice. They are expensive but I am glad we got them. I also have washed them 3 times and hung them out to dry and they look as good as new!"
3,names and more names,"This work would appeal most to people who already know the general history of Canada and enjoy being filled in about the personalities. Telling about these movers and sharpers is the book's strength. The main issues and general movements can get lost in the personality descriptions. That gives the book a detailed aspect that makes it hard to see the larger picture and the major moments of Canada's history. Still, enlightening for a U S citizen."
4,A wonderful brief history.,"A Short History Of Canada is an excellent choice for one who wishes to gain knowledge of both Anglo and Franco Canadian history. It's extremely interesting for Americans, as it juxtaposes American and Canadian History, showing how each country dealt with major world events. The author is also extremely witty, and adds in just the right amount of humor so that the book does not sound like a textbook. If you are an American, the sentence structure will seem odd. However, you get use to it by the third or forth chapter. Overall, the book is a great introduction to Canadian History. I would highly recommend it."
5,King of Cool,"Well, truth be told, the 92mm Zalman LED CPU cooler looks like something from a sci-fi movie. When you see it in person, you'll understand.I kept it on the kitchen table for several months just because it is such a cool looking widget. Everybody picked it up and stared. Neat toy. What an interesting piece of copper design.Yeah, it looks even cooler in the clear case, like a cosmic blue jet engine, and yeah, it keeps the 125W Quad CPU running at 80 F.It has been running for about 90 days without complaint.I'm glad I bought this Zalman. It does the cooling job and has WOW factor at the same time. Does it get any better?I most strongly recommend this product. It's a great purchase."
5,Ultra Quiet and Ultra Cool,this cooler is simply amazing...i upgraded my cpu from a p4 2.0ghz(northwood) to a p4 3.0ghz(prescott) and i was heating up to 60+ degrees during full load with the stock intel cooler...with the help of arctic silver 5 thermal grease with this zalman cooler temps are capped to 49 degrees while overclocked to 3.4ghz under full load...installation is a little difficult at first and may require some thinking...i can see how people can install this improperly and not get the results that i did...price - goodnoise - quietstyle - awesomeperformance - greatinstallation - trickythis is by far one of the best coolers out there...just make sure your case has the room because it is GINORMOUS!!!...and did i mention it looks way cool...pun intended...
2,Careful Now!,"Hey guys! I just wanted to let you know that this is not the best deal for your money. If you are able to get this thing for $20 buck then I would suggest it, but It is definitely not worth $45. I soon discovered that you could receive better performance for cheaper if you purchase the Hyper 212 coolermaster HEatsink. If you purchase the hyper 212 and pay an extra $4 for another 120mm fan then you get to a grand total of about $27! And with this Hyper 212 plus an extra 120mm fan, you will receive performance that is almost 6-7 degrees Celsius cooler than the Zalman for cheaper!!!!! Only the Hyper 212 may not fit inside your case, and this is where the ZAlman may win. IF you have a tiny case and want to pay $20 more for a smaller, less efficient fan then go for the ZAlman. Overall, this product is just not priced effectively."
4,"WOW, THIS IS UNBELIEVEABLE....","All what I can say is WOW, I have a P4 3.2 Prescott which is known to be an extremely hot processor, now with this beast my idle became 45c and under load is 59c and that when the Zalman fan is running at the lowest settings 1300cc to 1600cc; on my previous Intel stock fan I used to get 55c idle and 78c under load.....However I gave this baby 4 stars because installation was extremely difficult, and I mean really a pain process where actually I bleed my fingers.And just to be accurate I used Arctic Silver Grease.If your processor is too hot like mine, get this and you won't regret it, and Oh, did I tell you that the PC is too quiet now that I can hear myself mumbling!!!!And also Amazon ROCKS !!! I choose free shipping which is suppose to be 3 to 5 days but Amazon got it on my door steps the SECOND DAY!!!! THANKS AMAZON......"
4,Very effective,"I built a HTPC and was unable to playback video due to high cpu temperatures locking the PC up. This combined with Arctic Silver 5 thermal compound lowered my idle temperatures from 65C to 32C and at a full load from 80C to 40C.The reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that installation is a little tricky with 478 socket cpus. It took me 3 tries, reapplying the thermal compound each time before i was able to get the screws in correctly. Normal screws would have made installation a lot easier."
1,BEWARE,"We were sent software with 3 games in it, not the software as advertised. Worse was the Trojan! Security caught it and I had to confiscate Santa's gift to my 5 and 6 year old and try to explain why Santa would do such a thing. Wanted to give it a no star rating but system doesn't allow."
3,CARS on PC with a Force feedback wheel,"Got the game for my kids... who are 2 and 4. A little too young to race, but they like cruising around aimlessly and crashing into things. The game has modes where you can do just that. Good enough for them. No ""damage"" to the car, just keep on driving. So teh fun is not interrupted when the car stops working. My force feedback wheel was a total pain to get working, until I learned that there was one more page of controls to enter in the settings. ""game controls"" it was called I think, seemingly nothing to do with steering but you had to program those too for the wheel. Which by the way has no force feedback. Just centering, no bumps. And it takes a lot of wheel turning to make the car turn, not very responsive at all. maybe another setting somewhere. My wheel has a ""realistic"" over 360degree turning range, that's probably it. A cheaper simpler wheel would work better.I haven't played the game much myself. it's good entertainment for the kids."
2,Cars Video Game for Windows,"The game itself meets anticipated goals, but I was surprised that it does not operate on either Vista or Windows 7. Thankfully I was able to locate an old computer with the XP operating system so that my grandchildren can use it."
5,It matches the movie perfectly,The game is fantastic. My 4-yr-old thought we were actually in the movie. Bought a joystick to make it easier for him to play. He still needs a little help but the game is great. I have played other car racing games in the past and this is fun as well as a high-quality one.
4,Cars ( Disney / Pixar ) PC Windows,I purchased this CD for my 4 yr old grandson and he loves it. He does real well with the racing. So far none of the racing games are as easy to maneuver as I feel they should be for kids.
3,Cars PC,"This game is very nice, but it is some difficult to play in a computer. I prefer xbox360 ... lol"
5,"Read it, then decide","I have read this book, and I found it to be a careful documentation of what happened based on court and other government documents, as well as independent interviews with the people who were there.Those who suggest that this book has an agenda are correct - it is an agenda that seeks the full truth and nothing less. Justice, and nothing less.Read it and decide for yourself.--abeAbraham J. Bonowitz"
1,Ohio Reader,"Straughton Lynd's book is a total one sided view of the ""Lucasville 5"". His release of the names of the inmates who cooperated with investigating authorities has compromised their health, safety, and welfare...even those who have been transferred out of the state of Ohio. It is my understanding that because of this, the book is not being permitted into Ohio's correctional facilities and rightfully so.Mr. Lynd has apparently allowed his aversion to the death penalty and unwillingness to hold inmates accountable for their crimes to cloud his objectivity and his sense of responsibility. The death of 10 inmates and 1 correctional officer deserved better than Mr. Lynd's self-serving effort."
1,One Sided,"This book was written very ""One sided"".The other Lucasville books are much less, unbias and give a better picture of what went on those 11 days."
4,Good soft rock compilation,"I thought this was a good compilation filled with 80s love ballads but I thought Stevie Nicks' ""Edge of Seventeen"" seemed out of place considering the song was heavier than the other songs that were featured on this album, I do like that it has a few hard to find tunes featured on here (Rupert Holmes, Karla Bonnoff and Larry Graham)"
4,Eclectic Mix of AC Tunes,"Not bad, considering that many of these tracks are by one-hit wonders (Karla Bonoff, the Motels, Larry Graham), and are tough to get anywhere else. Over 74 minutes of original hits with good sound quality."
4,A well-paced and lucid introduction to Christianity,"Ward's achievement suceeds in being clear and simple, concise, and demonstrates well the plurality present within Christianity. He achieves a fairly balanced presentation of a Christianity full of different views which are simultaneously connected to one another in a symbiotic theological and historical relation. Though sometimes his theological preferences surface, this is often subtle and often his biases remained fairly submerged. Beginners will find this book a helpful introduction to the Christian faith that is neither pendantic nor emotional blibber blabber. I highly recommend this to any one, believer or not, who is interested in exploring the vistas of Christian dogma."
3,Lacking clear instructions,"The artist's paintings in this book are beautiful, but I found the step-by-step intructions to be very unclear with steps missing. Also, the preliminary drawings are very sketchy and most are not detailed enough to be able to follow along with the artist without considerable redrawing. The concept of this book is very good and with more accurate drawings and more concise directions it could be an excellent learning tool, but as it stands I wouldn't recommend it for the novice watercolorist. If you are looking for projects with clear, concise directions and accurate line drawings I recommend ""Step-by-Step Guide to Painting Realistic Watercolors"" by Dawn McLeod Helm. ""Watercolor Right From the Start"" or ""Color Right From the Start"" by Hilary Page are also both excellent books for the beginning watercolor painter."
4,"Burning for Buddy: A Tribute to the Music of Buddy Rich, Vol. 2","Gawd, what a fantastic CD; except that butcher/hack job done to Channel One. This track almost made me vomit. One of Buddy's greatest tunes destroyed by the vocals/lyrics. Don't listen to Channel One. Other than this track, the CD is great. The band tight and right on the money."
2,Didn't work in my case,"I recently got home to New England after a 12,550-mile motorcycle ride. The vest didn't work for me. It just made me feel soggy, not much cooling effect at all. After the vest was soaked in water the fabric felt slimy. The vendor told me that was something they had seen before from this manufacturer, in defective lots. They were happy to give me a refund, no trouble, even though I had bought the vest more than 90 days earlier."
3,it works well,It does what it is meant to do and keeps me alot cooler. The only problem is that in this Taxas heat I can ride 2 horses so 1 hour and a half beforeI need to soak it again. However it is better then riding without
1,Too Fast,"Product claims of 5-10 hours cooling are a wee bit exaggerated if you are going to use this for hot weather motorcycle riding. I have used it several times over the top of a mesh Kevlar shirt. When worn outside other clothing like this, the evaporation rate is way too fast. It was bone dry within 45 minutes. Next time I will try it under the mesh shirt.My other dislikes include (1) the shorty cut in front that doesn't come down to the waist when standing up. Otherwise, it makes a great blue collar fashion statement. (2) the front lower edges fold up in the wind on the motorcycle, exposing additional midriff.I suppose it would function better underneath a mesh shirt or riding jacket where it can't be seen, the wind can't catch it, and the evaporation rate is slower."
4,Love it!,"I watch a lot of DVD's and just recently I decided to buy a home theater system. The high end home theaters are too much for my wallet so I looked around for the home theater in a box. I saw the LG LGDVT418 and loved it. It comes with 4 floor standing speakers, instead of 4 small ones that you have to find a table to sit them on. The subwoofer gives enough ""oomph"" for all the medias that could play on the DVD, including DVDs, audio CDs, and even MP3 CDs. Overall this is a great bargain for anyone who wants a home theater/DVD player but not the home theater price."
3,Home Soil ....Or Ugly Bags of Water Go Home!,"""Ugly Bags of Water""A terraforming station on Velara III discovers a microscopic life form within the sand of the planet. It kills one of the colonists to save it from destruction. The Enterprise utilizes it's universal translator to communicate. It refers to humans as ""ugly bags of water."" In this average entry from the first season; actor Walter Gotell, portrays the station supervisor. He's known for his role as General Gogol in the 60's James Bond series.This episode has a few good highlights. Data disarming the laser cannon in the terraforming chamber. The microscopic entity taking control of the Enterprise. If you've got to purchase all the episodes for your collection; this one's got a few dramatic moments. It's worth a look.It didn't take Troi's powers to tell us the supervisor was hiding something about the planet."
4,Ingersoll quality,"Great drill, the trigger is great letting you easily control the speed, not as powerful as others its size, but a very well made tool for the right job."
4,These guys can really rock!,"Big Wreck is one of the best rock bands to come along in a long time. In my opinion, they rank right up there with Third Eye Blind, Matchbox 20 and the Barenaked Ladies. There are some very strong songs on the cd, such as The Oaf, That Song, Blown Wide Open, and Look What I Found. But there are also some songs that don't quite live up to the standards of the songs I just mentioned. Overall, I recommend this cd to anyone who liikes rock/alternative music."
4,They are even better live!,"i saw these guys live, they were awesome! they sound like a cross between live and king's x, with jeff buckley meets chris cornell vocals. a true talent."
4,'That Song' is perhaps the best 'pure' rock song of the year,"While I haven't heard most of the album, ""That Song"" is one of the best rock songs I've heard in years. It reminds you of the best of Van Halen, Led Zeppelin, etc, yet doesn't sound tired out.I listen mostly to techno/dance/house music these days, but I grew up listening to classic rock. ""That Song"" strikes the same resonance in me that such songs as ""Heartbreaker"", ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", as well as such alternative songs such as ""3 Strange Days"" and ""Dream all Day"" did in the early 90s. So in other words, it's really really good."
3,Reaching For the Sugar,"After hearing ""The Oaf"", I had high hopes for this CD. Unfortunately, the rest of the tunes don't live up to the opening cut. The second track ""That Song"" could have been a winner but ended up droning off in endled repetition. While the members of Big Wreck have the ability to perform, they seem to lack the capability of writing top notch songs.While some reviewers mention some flavor of Led Zeppelin or The Who in Big Wreck's music, my impression is that the influences are actually second hand, by way of Canada's Big Sugar.If you like the song ""The Oaf"", buy any Big Sugar CD instead of this one. Your ears will thank you for it."
5,In Loving Memory Of,"This album rocks! I am their biggest fan now, and possibly a potential stalker--thats how good they are! Everyone should buy this now!"
4,Solid album,"It's a shame this Canadian band bit the dust. Even though Ian (lead singer) does sound like a Chris Cornell clone, the music here is solid from start to finish. Ian Thornley is a great songwriter and hopefully we'll be hearing more from him and his band Thornley in the near future."
5,Very good,The nails performed as promised and is something I would do again if I needed it. The right tool makes all the difference between failure and success.
5,Just what I was looking for....,These were perfect for the Bostitch Nailer. Trouble free. They certainly did the job. I definately recommend this product. More than worth the price.
3,Buy this only if you you install 1/2 or thinner floor,Nothing wrong with the product but there is really no difference between this and the longer one which is cheaper.
2,"I'm sure they'd be great, if they fit what they should","According to the manufacturer, these fit a Bostitch brad nailer model SB1850BN, which I have. I ordered these up, but they definitely don't fit. I ended up having to nail my floor down by hand, which took a hell of a lot longer, and left me scared that I'd miss the nail and ruin a board with a hammer dent.So, I'm sure they're a good product, if you happen to have a nailer that they'll work in."
5,NG Does it again!,"One of my favorite things about National Geographic has always been the photos and this book is no exception. It is filled with a beautiful photos that span many years and great changes and advancements in photography. I devoured this book, photos only, in an evening at the local bookshop. When I am looking for a relaxing evening I can think of nothing better than to have a National Geographic magazine or collection of photos to pour over."
3,Great voice is not enough,"Lead singer Mary Lorson does indeed have a great voice. She's one of those vocalists who can sing an achingly sweet tune or change tempos and do an uptempo rocker. That said, I didn't find this album nearly as engaging as their previous effort, ""Panic On."" Unlike that fine album, there wasn't the same sense of wonder or plethora of songs with tuneful majesty to be found on this album. That said, this is still a worthwhile listen. If you enjoyed ""Panic On"" you may like this CD too. With Lorson's distinctive vocals, and the guitars in the band, Madder Rose was sometimes compared to the Cranberries. That's not a bad comparison, but Madder Rose's music wasn't quite as loud or stadium rock-ish, leaning more towards atmospheric song structures. One reviewer mentioned ""trip-hop"" but I don't really hear that on here. Whatever the sub-genre, this was a band that should be heard by more listeners."
3,pretty good,"The list is great but some songs were cut short. ""In the still of the night"" & ""You've got another thing comin'"" both had chunks taken out, the string part on Still of the night was cut out which is the best part of the song, that really annoyed me. Other than that this is a great comp album."
5,Blues rock at it's best,"This band live has more presence than any other. If you are a fan of Matchbox20, Tonic, 3rd Eye Blind, and any other band of the moment, DO NOT GET THIS CD. If however, you like blues rock, this is one of the best I've EVER come across. Enjoy."
3,Not what I expected...,"Shame on Amazon for not providing a better description. This is a workbook - which doesn't mean much to me. Sad thing is, it is a companion to a SIX VIDEO SET and the blanks have to be filled in after viewing the videos. I am upset that the description didn't mention that. No way am I buying 6 videos, but now I have a book that is essentially useless. I am sure it would provide lots of great information once the info is seen in the video and written down!"
5,If you lived in a college dorm from 1990-1994 you will appreciate this cd,"Lush are perhaps one of the better representatives of the so called ' shoe-gazer' sound of the early 1990'sthis is one of the better best of collections by a band that should have enjoyed a much more successful career no thanks to U.S. radioat any rate, we are treated to various sonic treats like ""Ladykiller"" and ""Monochrome"" and various points in betweenyou will not be disappointed by this cd!"
2,A half-interesting film.,"After a very interesting 30 minutes, this film looked to be headed into stylish Norwegian reworking of The Thomas Crown Affair. Very interesting set-up of the protagonist's lifestyle and motivations. Then the film devolved into a gratuitously violent, extremely bloody, gory beat 'em up and shoot 'em up. From very smart to very dumb. Massive disappointment. Recommended for no one."
5,Excellent!,"I love Jo Nesbo's novels, so when I saw this was based on one of his books, I was excited to see it. The action never stops, and the twists and turns are very unexpected. If you liked ""Fargo,"" you will love this!"
4,4.5 stars...enjoyed it a great deal!,"Very well-written and acted. I really enjoyed this film. While the protagonist did not have the physical characteristics that are commonly associated with a leading man (a fact the character contends early in the film), he has great stage present and a range that runs the gamut of human emotions. He's an antihero at best but you become totally enthralled with his plight and share in in his bewilderment as we navigate sharp curves and hidden agendas throughout the course of the film. Overall, not a bad way to spend two hours."
2,Nonsense movie,"When someone gets hit by a speeding semi, falls off a cliff in a pulverized car and wakes up with a few scratches, you know the movie is bollocks. Uninteresting plot and retarded storyline makes this a time waster. Kingslayer's performance is commendable."
3,Good. Not great.,"Definitely entertaining but not the grandness proposed by some of the other reviews. Unexpected outcome, however, that made the movie pretty good."
4,Must See,"Worth the time. All of the ingredients you would want in a really good flick....violence, plot twists, love gone wrong etc..."
5,Excellent Movie,This was great. Well developed plot somewhat like Fargo. The twists and turns are unexpected. A great European thriller! I didn't care it I had to read the subtitles. It was that good.
4,Action packed,Lots of twists and turns with a surprise ending. Loved the action but wanted to own book to clarify some of the action along the way.
3,Heartless assassin stuff,"Overall this is an enjoyable little film. It suffers from not making it clear that the central character of the burglar is quick thinking and imaginative. The chase scenes are fairly exciting but at some point it becomes unbelievable. It is heartless assassin stuff.Where the King of this genre isThe Day of the Jackalas well as the connection with real life events in France at that time, that film is also beautifully paced. Plenty of room for the viewer to get to know the assassin. Can we really condemn this professional man for his killings? He only kills when he is threatened, after all. The rich woman in bed is a masterpiece of dueling sympathies. A film I watch many times.The Headhunters is nowhere near this level. The film propels itself from one chase scene to another. They are often ingenious action sequences but ultimately the film is perilously close to comic book with some unbelievable twists. A one shot film."
4,Nice little thriller,"Kept wondering who's going to be the lead when remade in English. Any of our leading men want to play their real height, 5'6"". Brutish and nasty and twisty. Good enough to pass the time."
4,If Thomas Crown was Dutch,"Good film. Saw with subtitles. Interesting story and plot. Not as twisted as I thought, but nicely shot. Who am I? Dr. Suess?"
3,Not much of Nikolaj.,"If you're planning to watch this to catch Nikolaj Coster-Waldau outside the Game of Thrones, he has a relatively small part here. The lead guy (Aksel something) is okay of course, but he isn't the best actor in the cast, which is distracting. The plot, altho dirivative and over-the-top at times, would probably be fun for younger male audiences and random others. It's not a bad movie. I gave it 3 stars, but if there had been a scale of 1 to 10, it would have gotten 6. If it's Waldau you're after, see the series, New Amsterdam, on hulu. He'll also be in the next Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion, out April, 2013."
2,"OK Story, Gratuitous Graphic Sex","This movie presents a story that has intrigue, surprise, and clever plot twists, but I threw it in the trash. Unless you like to see people fornicating and full frontal nudity, you won't like this movie either."
3,Headhunters,"I only wanted to see this film because of Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Most of the film was focused on Roger Brown, played by Aksel Hennie. It's a testament to his performance and the action sequences in the film that I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. This film is also genre busting in a way because the focus of the film is more on relationships than the sex and violence. Roger Brown has a really wonderful character arc. I felt one way about him at the beginning of the film and by the end I really wow... did a total 180 just because he grows so much through his experience. The plot keeps you guessing. Unpredictable."
4,very good black comedy,"It is a really good comedy/thriller, it feels a little bit artificially constructed in the first 15-20 minutes but everything else is really good. In particular I like the logic in the sequence of events."
4,Nice twists!,Not your normal predictable movie. Subtitles not an issue. Was on edge of my seat for much of this. Would recommend to a friend.
2,Stylish nonsense,"Somewhat interesting to watch moment by moment but there are so many holes in the plot, so many inexplicable actions, so many aspects that are just ridiculous--one wonders how it was able to be made in the first place."
4,Enjoyable movie,This movie has plenty of twists and turns. The story-line is suspenseful and keeps you engaged. Very good directing. Good character development and acting. Solid movie. I enjoyed it.
1,Lasted until first car wash,I was very disappointed in this product. It got mangled the first time through the car wash.
5,In my Top 5,"To use the old cliche, if I were removed to a desert island and could only take five CDs, this would be one. I'm bummed because I've had this CD four years and don't know when or if the band will return with another effort. The final song, ""Please,"" was just downright awful when I first heard it, but now it's one of my favorites. I love every song. Like all great music, the first listen-through is the worst on ""The Happiest Dogs."" It just gets better from there. The vocals are unique, and the band doesn't sound like a million others who play the trendy alternative ... that's out these days. This is alternative at its best. Let's just hope there's more coming."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Fred Neubauer and Alden G. Lank take a long hard look at the family business, both as a powerful engine of economic development and as a fragile organism in need of constant care and attention. After an initial examination of family business' role in the global economy, Neubauer and Lank turn to an assessment of what makes some family concerns thrive while others disintegrate. Their answer: corporate governance, or the lack thereof. An academic tone permeates the book, resulting in both some patches of dry prose and an intellectual rigor lacking in most business books. We from getAbstract highly recommend this serious study of family business to any serious students of business in general."
4,Wrapping for a quilt,Worked fine for wrapping a quilt to keep it dust free and clean. Would work well for storage as well
3,Good item,"I purchased this item to put my son's stuffed toyes in. The only issue is that i wish it had handles on it, other than that, its a good product."
3,Battery Charger does the job!,it works for my digital minolta camera so I am happy I can use it again. Left the charger on my last vacation in hotel.
2,proof reading is your friend,"If you are going to write a book then make sure it is worth reading. As a clemson student I thought that this book would be a good read. However, there was so many small mistakes in the book. For example, some of the percentages did not add up to 100. Also, many words were used improperly. These mistakes did make me chuckle a bit."
4,Nice family movie,I only watched it at first because I enjoy Kate Mulgrew from Star Trek Voyager and the plot seemed cool so I rented it just to pass some time. The story and characters grew on me and I found myself really enjoying this movie. Always nice to find a movie hardly anyone has ever heard of and enjoy it and be suprised by it.
3,Not a great movie but interesting in it's own way,This movie was interesting enough to keep us watching but it's not a great movie. It's good enough to while away a boring afternoon.
2,Expensive,I didn't register for this lamp because of the price. It's a lamp... To expensive I felt bad registering for it so I registered for something a lot cheaper and I'm sure it will work as good!
2,Over Priced!,"Sorry but thats one over priced lamp! Its adorable and I would have loved to add it to the babys room, but I didn't feel right about buying it or even adding it to the registry because of the price!OOh well....we'll find something else. it is asorable though- we just dont have that kind of money!"
4,Loved It!,"If you like suspense and archaeology, this book is for you. I found this book to be fast-paced, exciting, and a real thriller. While I don't believe that the government is ""out-to-get-you"", I found the plot fascinating and the characters memorable."
2,Errors detracted from story,"Christopher Lane needs to learn to do a little basic research before writing, apparently. His errors on military structure (a sergeant, which is a non-commissioned officer, is trying to make ""non-com"" -- hello, he already is one) and paleontology (saying T. Rex never got further south than Colorado, when remains have been found in Texas) really set my teeth on edge. The military etiquette mistakes grated on me as well. I also had problems with his ""creation science"" stance, but if you're religious that probably won't bother you. However, even most creation science people have admitted by now that all the supposed dinosaur-man trackways are just dinosaur trackways or outright fakes, so having a character in the book who really ought to know better saying that there are several such sites was also annoying. Other than that, it was an almost decent book."
4,Great for dry storage.,"Excellent container for general food storage. I have 2, 4, 8, and 12 quart sizes that I use to store dry goods like flour and sugar. They are a lot easier to scoop out of than a typical flour/sugar jar and seal better as well. They are also easier to clean and keep clean than a lot of other storage options.Two things to keep in mind, get the correct size for what you intend to store and don't forget to purchase lids. They need to be bought separately for each container, which is kind of annoying."
4,Recommend for marinating and storage,"I normally utilize this for marinating or brining to be place in the refrigerator and for capacity, it does fit nicely."
5,Great .,"Big and sturdy food container to do brines or raise dough.Easy to clean, do not keep odors. Highly recommend."
5,works great,I got this for brining and it works just great!I would highly recommend this to anyone serious about cooking.
4,avant-style,"Nice, big collection of largely experimental and downtempo jazz with a bit of instrumental hip-hop chucked in for good measure. Plays kind of like a Kruder & Dorfmeister, but with an otherworldy obscure sound that may at times put off the casual listener. My only problem is that Yokota has mixed 25 tracks into 60 minutes - and standouts (IMO) like 310's St. Mesa Substation and The Sons of Silence's A Grain of Sand, are too darn short."
3,Beautiful sounds. Keys are too soft for serious players.,"I love the sound of this electronic piano. The size is perfect, which fits right into my small apartment. I usually use a headphone when playing so that I don't bother my roommate----This is very important if you have a roommate or if you have neighbors downstairs and upstairs in your apartment building. The only complain is that I feel that the keys are too soft. It gives a very different feels from real piano. So, I go to the piano practice room in my college as much as possible. I play in my apartment when the piano practice rooms on campus are full or during the winter (I am in Michigan) when I want to avoid the travelling."
5,Real piano feel,As a student new to the piano I would humbly say that this instrument accomplishes its goal to play and feel like a full size manual piano with its hammer-action keys. This is the best feature along with its diminutive size to fit into a small space with a full-size keyboard. I have not yet tested all the many other sound and accompaniment features yet but they're all there to use as my skill improves.
4,"Loved the series, did get weak at the end","I really did love this series, but I felt that it became very weak in theend. It was almost like the producers had no good ending. The setting isworth the purchase. The actors are well suited to their roles."
5,Good value for one of our favorite TV Series,This item arrived in a timely manner and was purchased for a fair price.Thank you.
5,Better than a vacation,"In a world of the sad, the bad and the ugly, Monarch of the Glen is the best vacation from the daily drearies: and you only pay the price of the vids. Gorgeous scenery, excellent acting, clean comedy, it's a morale boost for when the frustrating bits of life get you down... and you don't even have to put your dog in the kennel and use up your vacay days from work.Recommend it with the highest of ratings. Watch it once a year and you will rarely want to spend another pence on petrol prices. Unless of course, you absolutely must visit Loch Laggan in the Spey Valley of the Scottish Highlands where this series was filmed.Grab your scones and single malt for an evening of pure escapism."
3,Monarch of the Glen,"Good scenery, good to fair story, difficult to understand Scotch accent of most of the actors. We had to use english subtitles to continue the series."
5,SEXIEST VIDEOS AROUND!!,"As a Yoga lover, these videos blew my mind. Sensual and erotic and a wonderful way for men to cut thought the taboos of touch and self expression amongst other men. Its time for ALL men to realise we are all part of the same clan. Great stuff!"
5,Finally...The Perfect Yoga DVDs!,"After several years of practicing yoga and being disappointed by so many ""instructional"" yoga DVDs and videos targeted to our specific audience, I am delighted to say that Aaron Star's latest effort is, in a word, amazing. I have purchased and watched the entire set, and with each subsequent viewing, I discover new and wonderful nuances which have profoundly enhanced my own practice. And it certainly doesn't hurt that all the men featured are beautiful, graceful, and the epitome of what I hope to achieve for myself. The filming and editing are first rate, the instruction clear and concise, and the flow and pace of the videos are perfect. I highly recommend these regardless of whether you are new to yoga, or have been practicing for years...there is much here for everyone. Thank you Aaron!"
4,My daughter likes it,Bought this as a gift for my 6 year old daughter. She had used one in music class and wanted one of her own. It is a very basic design but it works well and sounds okay.
4,"Fast service, great product","We ordered these for the insulators on our crew, they work great for this. The first thing we did was remove the pencil holder and put the extra thumb screw that comes with it in a safe place. We will be ordering more, a cheap alternative to Osborne dividers, though they don't have the micro adjuster."
4,The Windigo's Return,My children enjoyed The Windigo's Return. This story of the origin of Mosquitoes is based on Ojibway legend. It has suspense and humor.....and not enough suspense to really frighten children. The Native American imagery is not mawkish and children today can feel kinship with the heroine. The pictures are good. We enjoy rereading it.
3,A new view of a classic tale,"In 1803, Lewis and Clark set out to explore the land known as the Louisiana Purchase. Although their expedition was very successful, it would have failed without their Indian guide Sacagawea. Poor Sacagawea often gets overlooked, but no longer. Now you can follow the expedition through the eyes of this remarkable young woman.This tale is good for its unique quality alone. Learn about Sacagawea's life before the expedition, and see it's trials through her eyes. All in all it is a new take on a famous historical happening. Fans of Scott O'Dell will especially enjoy this tale, written in his unique style."
5,goooood,this book was very good and that is very good to hear from me. i usually like horror books or scary things like that but i really like this book and it was very helpful
2,A fictional take on history,"Sacagawea is a young girl when this story begins, and is captured by the Minnatarees in the first chapter. The book continues with her captivity, marriage, and journey with the Lewis and Clark expedition. I think it is interesting if you are looking for fiction in this setting, but not if you want the facts. None of the history I have read substantiates any kind of romance between Sacagawea and William Clark, for example.Also, the book seems geared to children about the age of thirteen, as that is Sacagawea's age for most of it. I would not recommend it to children that young, as I think the themes of her marriage and attraction to William Clark are too mature."
3,Sacagewea,"This is a story about the famous Indian, Sacagawea ,in her teen years. When the story srarts out, she and her best friend are captured by the Minnetarees. While there she is won in a hand game meaning she has to marry a trader who is hired by Lewis and Clark, the famous explorers. While on the trip she falls in love with Captain Clark. During their adventures they have confrontations with Indian tribes and mother nature. This is a very good book for people 10 and up. I especially enjoyed reading about the Indian tribes. I read this for a school assignment."
3,Swimming in a stream of adventure and learning.,"Streams to the River River to the Sea was an interesting book. It's a very adventurous story about a 14 year old native American girl. I liked how it revealed real American history from Sacagawea's point of view. It made it seem more believable. From how she started in the Shoshone tribe to a long story of how she went on the journey with Lewis and Clark connected well. Although I did get a little bored through some of the chapters, if you like books with real history and adventure, read this. But, be prepared for a disappointing ending."
2,schoolgirl romance,"I read this book before allowing my eight year old daughter to read it. While engaging reading as an introduction to the Lewis and Clark saga, I found the fictional romantic sub-plot troubling. It advances the idea that the chief(only?) motivation of Sacajawa in pursuing the journey, as well as the woman's acts of courage chronicled in the journals, was her pursuit of the affections of Captain Clark. While arguably this romance between the two might have existed, it hardly does justice to the heroine to ascribe such weight to what boils down to a schoolgirl crush. It sends a negative message, I feel, to the young girls who read it. One might reasonably conclude from this novella that the only credible reason for a woman to become an explorer is the search for the love of a good man."
3,Lewis and Clark,"The book was generally good for a english assignment but was a little bit boring. Good for projects, not good for leisurly reading."
5,Very Good Music!!!!,"If you are a jazz fan,this is an excellant recording for you.At midnight,and News from the blue's are very good,as is the rest of this recording.One of my favorites!"
5,solid bass really impressed me. enjoyable overall,this is a refreshingly different sound. I really enjoy it.
2,Warning!,"Granted, this is a great collection of songs from a great era. However, be warned that on many of the cuts the remastering is very substandard. If sound is not important to you, then OK, it is a well-chosen collection. Just don't expect any sonic detail. You're old 45s sounded better, believe me."
3,Need the Rewetting Drops Back!,"The product is fine, similar to the Claris Care System, but for the price they NEED to put with the product rewetting drops and the case! I would give it 5 stars then."
2,Paper is just too thin..and sticks together..,"I am not sure if the notebooks were just too long in the warehouse but the pages stick together. They are so thin, no body to them. Just too frustrating trying to turn the page and then having to unsticking the thin pages then they tear. I wanted a small notebook to carry in my bag that had a lot of pages. Disappointed with the quality of the paper."
5,"such a great movie. Great story, amazing performances overall a real treat!!!",absolutely loved it and thought it provided such a great family drama without being too dramatic or over the top. One in which many can relate to regardless of how 'normal' or 'crazy' your family is
5,Best shampoo ever!,This shampoo makes my dog's coat soft and shiny. And it smells good. I will never buy another shampoo for my doggy.
2,"cleans the dog, but does not soften the fur","the smell is ok. sadly, my dog's coat was not softer after the bath. i like a clean soft dog and this shampoo does not do the trick.i have a few different dog shampoos and this is the last one i'll reach for. it's not worth my effort to return it."
3,pretty good,"This product was as described and expected. The material is sexy, but fragile. It also has visible seams which I'm not crazy about. On the model, a lot of her midriff shows. I am 5""4, and most of my midriff is covered by the fabric, making it a little less sexy than I thought it would be. The only part that's visible is a 2 inch strip on my belly. Just make sure you're aware that, unless you have the figure of the model, it will not look like it does on her."
3,yet another solid effort from B F,"This is not my favorite of the 4 Burnt Friedman discs I've collected, but it does have some true gems scattered accross it. Track 9 is really amazing..tight..and more groove influenced than the usual dub flavors. Pity Amazon.com does not have a sample of that because it is by far the best track on the disc. If it's dubby groove you are looking for, this fits the bill though not as much as some of his other discs, or similar stuff from Hels_Fornander, or Bill Laswell among others."
1,Not organized in a way that is useful for readers,They should have separated the maps according to counties butthey did not. It is difficult to use especially if you arenot already familiar with the area.
5,Love it!,"This is a great book from a great author. If you love real fantasy, other world books, you've got to read this one. Its fantasy, romance and mystery in one. You should also take a look at Ombria in Shadow, another book of hers. She has a wonderful way of making you feel the story, rather than just reading it, like your dreaming it up yourself. Go ahead escape into a world of adventure. ;)"
3,Dreamy,"The only thing I can truly praise about this book is the dream-like spell it casts over the reader. McKillip's prose flows gently along like water babbling over rocks in a brook - quiet, effortless, and beautiful. Her writing has a certain poetry about it that is memorable, and the book is worth a read if simply for her unique, calm tone that is as enthralling as a spell. As a work of fantasy, the novel acheives an effective air of mysticism and magic, but falls short on plot and characterization. As the first of McKillip's books I have read, I am curious to try some of her previous works in hopes of being more satisfied with the story as a whole."
4,"""It shapes your heart; you can hide nothing from it...""",Another great book from McKillip - a fairytale with a very natural warmth. The whole turning of the tricks and traps as lost legends move through time on their conquest of the present is handled skillfully. The pain you feel even for the coming conquerors who have their own sorrows that drive them - McKillip brushed on all details with amazing detail and concern for the characters.
3,A solid introduction,"Her newest book, and my first experience of her. I liked it. How could I not, really, it prominently features librarians! I also found the importance of names and writing very appealing. Basically it's about an orphan who is adopted by librarians (much better than being raised by wolves!) and raised as a translator. When she's 16 she ""finds"" a book that seems to only speak to her. It was a little predictable, but I'm going to give some of her other books a try."
3,Not up to her usual standards,"I am a big fan of Patricia McKillip's work, and I have read most of her books. I was a little disapointed then when I finished Alphabet of Thorn and realized That Was It. The characters lacked depth to me in this book. She tried to tell two completely different stories at once, and it interupted the story arc to the point of distraction. This book lacked cohesion, and an overarching plot. I also missed any emotional climax, and felt a little disapointed when I had finished.I recomend reading ""In The Forest of Serre"" by the same author instead."
2,Confusing & Didn't finish booko,"I began the book and quit after a few chapters due to the confusing world. This is only the second book in my 40+ years as an avid reader that I put down. A shame. If it had been clear and less dreamy, I would have gotten to the end."
3,Three-and-a-half stars,"This is a really amazing book overall, but it falls short on a few points. First, Nepenthe's character just didn't resonate with me, and Bourne and Tessera were so two-dimensional that I didn't care what happened to them. McKillip makes up for this boring-ness with the second subplot, about Axis and Kane, which was truly wonderful and had all the elements of a good fantasy. The Axis and Kane story was so good, in fact, that I would still have given the book five stars. However, without spoiling the book, the ending was just bad. It was unnecessarily emotional and Kane's big decision seemed to just come out of nowhere and be a spur-of-the-moment decision instead of one she'd thought through, which I'm sure was how McKillip wanted it.My overall feelings on this book are: Read it, definitely, but stop about five pages from the end and make up your own ending. It will save you from throwing an otherwise amazing book out a window into the rain."
1,Painful Read,"This could be the worst book I have ever attempted to read. The world that McKillip attempts to create has no cohesion. The magic in the book seems to be completely random. The characters act without reason and the plot of the book is not just convoluted, but also boring. This is the first book in years that I haven't been able to finish reading (and I read close to 100 books a year). I honestly don't understand how anyone can give this book a good review."
5,Woo Hoo!,"Jimmmy is, and always will be, ""The Lizard King""!As Grace Slick, of the Jefferson Starship said, ""He was not a poser, what you saw, is what you got!""I am in awe of ""The Wordman, never a Birdman""!His sexuality exudes from every pore of his body - he should have been nominated (and would have probably won!) the title of ""One of The Sexiest Men""!"
4,Nice air tool,"Works great. The only hang up I have with this air tool is, the exhaust hose does not fit properly and keeps sliding down. Other than that. this is a nice addition to our shop. I would buy another one!"
1,vulgarized Heidegger,"This book is an extremely poor and misleading introduction to Heidegger's thought. Neither Heidegger's hermeneutical-phenomenological interpretive method, nor the ""being"" question as he understood it, nor his philosophical roots are even tolerably depicted. The special kind of inner coherency, rigor, and ""feel"" for the structures of ""human experience"" that makes Heidegger's thought stand out are mostly ignored here, and instead we are given a bizarre selection of decontextualized tidbits from Heidegger which, when interpreted in the sloppy and cliched way these authors prefer, almost make him look like some granola-crunching New Age guru. If you have read this book, please do not judge Heidegger by it. If you have not, don't- instead try the equally clear and much more accurate introductory texts written by Polt and Dreyfus."
2,"Poor for ""Beginners"" book.","I've read a hand full of the Beginners book and have liked them all so far. I'm a philosophy major and have found them to be helpful to use along with the original text at times, but this one is just bad. Its extremely short, I read through it in one sitting. I feel like I learned about as much as I could have from a Wikipedia article. Try the ""Introducing"" Heidegger over this book."
1,this is a comic book,"Heidegger is a great philosopher,as a matter of fact he is the greatest philosopher of this century,you must have an important philosophical culture to understand him.My opinion is that this book,like all other books of this serie are a blasphemy to all the hystory of philosophy beacouse if you want to get it (the philosophy) you must start with the begening and the begining is not this book,but the greek philosophers wich you must read in original.In conclusion getting out with a book like this is a stoopid thing to do.Sorry!"
4,Only one misunderstanding,"I was hoping my motherboard could actually regulate the speed but apparently this can't be done... I wonder if the ""Smart fan with speed detection"" ad means the fan regulates himself? More information would've been nice."
1,peeeeuw,I thought the album was WEAK!!! Especially the song Ah Leah. Now I know why they call it screamers .As soon as I played the samples I started to Scream. But thats jus my opinion.
4,A very nice collection,I found this collection to be very well put together. The only problem I had with it is that the recording quality of some of the songs was less than I would expect from a CD however if you could overlook that you need to have this one in your cd collection.
4,OK collection of 80's rock,"A pretty decent collection of hard to find and not so hard to find rock tracks from the 80's. The sound quality on some of the tracks (April Wine, Joe Walsh, Georgia Satellites) leaves a lot to be desired but apart from that it's OK."
2,song choices belie cd's title,"Triumph's Lay it on the Line and Donnie Iris' Ah! Leah! both qualify as screamers, but unless the people who compiled this collection meant ""screamingly funny,"" I don't understand why they titled it thusly. Nevertheless, I'll buy it because where else am I gonna find those two songs without buying entire Triumph and Donnie Iris albums? Not that I'm averse to having Tommie Tutone or Billy Squier's The Stroke, the latter of which does somewhat qualify as a screamer. But most of the 18 songs in this collection are better described as snoozers. A better choice from Foreigner would have been Head Games, which is actually a 2fer (screamer, screamingly funny). A better choice from April Wine would have been Roller, which is a screamer and also probably their best song. A final point: I can't imagine how Krokus' Screaming in the Night didn't make it onto this collection, and if it had I'd be much happier with it."
4,A good intro to the environment-property rights debate,"A refreshing and layperson's approach to the ever more complex debate on protecting the environment with property rights and entitlements. This is a solid rhetorical contribution that clarifies arguments for lawyers, economists, anthropologists, scholars and activists alike. It is multicultural and comprehensive enough for readers in the First and in the Third World."
4,adidas Big Kids' Whiz Kid Basketball Shoe,Good response time when wrong item was shipped. My son love them and they are easy to maintain.
5,Best cat shampoo ever,"Face it, cat's aren't fun to bathe. This shampoo makes it worth it. My cat is shinier than I thought possible, plus he smelled great for a week after the bath. And it's all natural. Totally worth it."
3,Cannot recommend :[,"I got this as a present. I usually use Castor & Pollux shampoo. Decided to try it out after seeing positive reviews. Very strong cherry smell, does not seem to foam-up very well, and I have been combing out mini-mattes since. I have an adult Coon and the matting seems to be in the fine underfur near his armpits and other hard-to-reach areas. I'm wondering if I didn't rinse out all the shampoo enough? This has never happened with the other product... Anyway, back to the C&P shampoo."
3,Interesting anecdotes about Kerouac's Life,"If you are a fan of the writing of Jack Kerouac, and want to know more about his life and the stories that were going on while he was writing his books, this is a good place to start. It helps to know a great deal about the Beat generation, and who some of the other people were that were involved in the Beat Generation. I'm a fan of Kerouac's but I don't know anything really about Ginsberg, Snyder, Burroughs, and the other Beat writers, so the book helped me learn a little more about them. My complaints about the book are that it's hard to keep all the people straight. The writer mentions a lot of different people and it's easy to get lost and have to go back and read the back story behind the person again, so that was confusing. But still, it's a very interesting book and it opened my eyes to who Kerouac truly was. The writer doesn't pull punches when it comes to discussing Kerouac's flaws."
5,Excellent text for Criminal Justice majors,"I am a college professor who just finished teaching ORGANIZED CRIME to twenty college juniors and seniors. I selected Abadinsky's book as the text because it is carefully and thoughtfully ""choreographed."" The information provided flows in a sensible and clearly written design. Some texts appear to be designed for Rhodes Scholars and are virtually impossible to read. This is not the case with this great book! I recommend it to teachers and those who have in interest in this fascinating subject."
2,"liked the music, pity about the awful camera work",Liked the music - good nostalgia stuff but the filming and editing of this DVD is awful. The camera angle changes every one to two seconds and I also got a headache after about 15 minutes and had to turn it off. Buy a CD!
4,Robin Gibb,"Saw this years ago and had it on our DVR and watched it over and over. Now that he passed away, we wished we still had it. Now we do and it's simply great."
2,Disappointed - Quality,"I am a huge Bee Gees and Andy Gibb fan (own a lot of their music and DVD's), so when I saw this DVD, I was excited to order it. When I received it, I played it right away. I was extremely disappointed as you can barely hear Robin sing. His band and orchestra completely drown out his voice.I don't have the heart to watch this again, as I know I'll only be frustrated with not being able to hear Robin. It's a shame as they are so talented and you would think between Robin and the producers they would've heard this and worked to greatly improve this before it was released."
2,BAD QUALITY,You cannot hear Robin's voice while playing the disc in DTS mode. And other listening modes are also bad.
1,somebody stop him!!!,"i LOVE the Bee Gees and Robin and all of them....I was at the One Night Only show in Vegas ...at GREAT expense. I wish I had enough money to buy up all the copies of this disaster so it wouldn't be out in the world tarnishing the brothers Gibb reputation. Besides the horrible , did I say horrible...wig he is wearing ever so sloppily, the sound as others report is terrible , the staging and other singers are worse than a vegas impersonator show production...YIIIIIKES! They are giving these away in the junk/remainder bin at CVS pharmacy stores for $3.99 and its overpriced at that. If you haven't seen it...DON'T, just DON'T!"
5,ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL AND FANTASTIC!!!,"Robin Gibb solidifies his place as a legend among the best of the best with his 2004 performance in the DVD. It truly is a shame that we can no longer be graced with the work of the three brothers as the Bee Gees, but Robin, as himself, does an excellent job in bringing life to those songs, ranging from Words and Saved By The Bell through the Saturday Night Fever era to his current hits, including Please and My Lover's Prayer. He, along with his brothers, can be placed with the greatest and most inspirational songwriters in history; he and his music continue to awe, amaze, and inspire all of us, and I am honored to have been able to appreciate their work. And this all coming from a 19-year-old fan."
2,Robin is not heard,"The best voice of the BeeGees can't really be heard on this DVD. I tried running it through the reciever, tried Hall, Stadium, Theater. He gets drowned out on every song by the back ground singers and the instruments..............It's a shame cuz he has such a good voice, maybe it's where it was recorded. Robin.........do you read this stuff??? Try a better recording place and do Maurice proud!"
1,These pictures are. . . INTERESTING.,"You can see clearly right through this product. I know this may sound prudish, but if you can see the woman's nipples. . . the pictures should be taken down."
4,Camping with the Army Corps of Engineers,"A unique feature of this small book is its tight list of Army Corps of Engineer Campsites that are not found in many other directories or guidebooks.This guide will tell you if the campsite is located near a big city like Atlanta or in a rural area. Organized by state, maps of your destination area are a helpful adjunct. As the name implies, most facilities are located near a body of water. Some tend to be more family oriented, others are described as hideaways--peaceful locations where you can commune with nature. The book provides good directions from major highways and clear information about the campsites. (Most list amenities, such as electric, water and dump stations.) This is a useful tool to have with you on any trip. Coming upon one of these sites can be a wonderful diversion. D. Brandley"
4,Great data ...,"Here's a book that would have made a great spreadsheet. There's a lot of data here, displayed via a string of pictographs. Text in this book serves to provide directions only.I would have rated this higher if it provided a little background on the location, the history, geographic features, etc."
4,Camping resourse,"As a retired Corps of Engineer officer and a new RVer, I found this book interesting and helpful in planning for trips.We have not camped at one of the Corps sites yet, but have visited a couple recently and found the book to accurately describe the ones we have visited."
4,Good reference work,"This camping book is formatted similar to another one we use a lot. That is a plus. However, most of the sites it describes--at least in California--are lakes, and we haven't made those a priority. So, actually, we haven't used this book much yet, but we don't rule out future use of it either. The print font is sufficiently large for easy reading; the symbols are easy to decipher. Overall, a good reference book."
3,Camping with the Corps of Engineers,The product came when expected. I was hoping the book would have more details about each park but I am glad that it does have every park listed with the services available at each park.
3,camping with the Corps of Engineers,"Bought this book with a recommendation from someone who was camping. It's a good book but not thorough enough. The Corps have camping books for areas and you really need them too. I wish this book was more detailed like Woodalls, but it's not. I still use this book and have camped at their sites which are quite nice."
2,"My Favorite Martian, 3rd Season","This is one of my favorite shows. The first two seasons were excellent and the DVD's of them are great including graphics & finding your favorite episodes. However, this third season was not done by Rhino as the others were and therefore, has poor graphics and the way this inferior company put it together is quite annoying. Also, being the only season filmed in color, I feel that this final season loses its charm. I had hoped that Rhino would do the third season also but for some unknown reason chose not to and it is indeed, a shame."
4,"Shipping Troubles, or Defects?","Disc one has a glitch in one of the first two episodes which could be the result of, in this case, the disc coming loose in the box during shipping and becoming scratched while floating loose."
4,Very easy to understand with lots of great circuits to build,"As a person new to the area of electronics and Microcontrollers this book has helped a lot. There are lots of circuits that can be used and adapted for projects. However some of the things covered are free on the interent & the parallax website. Two things that have impressed me most are the pages about adding extra input and output lines, overall it covers many of the common components and how to use them. If you are not an expert in electronics and want to build a microcontroller project then buy this book!"
3,"Fine for Hobbies, Poor for Design","If you wanna make some microcontroller gizmos quickly and simply, this is the book for you. However, if you're more interested in designing an embedded system and need at little help interfacing to the analog world, find a more thourough book written by a hardware or digital systems engineer.All the included circuits work for prototying, test, and hobby I/O interfacing to the real world, and are easy to understand. But please do not make the mistake of using this book as a design guide for potential consumer/commercial/industrial products or scientific uses."
4,superb photo reference of uniforms with very generalized text......,"Book is out of print so you'll be hard pressed to find this one for a good price but igot this book for 25.00 bucks, got a sweet deal, while some will complain about the generalized, but adequate text, those guys at historie & collections know how to put a quality reference ww2 book together.I'm a 1/6th military action figure customizer and this book was invaluable for me.If you can find it, definately buy it....you won't be disappointed...and YES the text is adequate!"
2,Pass on this one.,"Very basic, many better reference books on airborne available. I have returned my copy to Amazon."
4,Dude What A Monkey,"Yo im gonna complain cauz the vinyl is not pink the color i want it to be..............Nahhhhh im just kidding im not a little b%tch like that. As for the album it never sounded better.......Very punchy with nice and shiny keyboards,etc.... If you like this album and you dont mind that its on generic black vinyl (that was so stupid) then by all means get it.Excuse My Poor GrammerRobert Keith"
2,"Cumbersome Use, Questionable Accuracy","This ball has to be gripped very firmly to start a reading; considerably tighter than one would normally clutch when throwing catch or pitching especially. This forces the user to modify technique significantly just to get a relatively accurate number.When a grip is released, the clock starts and the reading begins and stops when the ball is no longer moving. The ball is basically just a stopwatch that calculates feet per second and converts to MPH.In our testing, multiple throws made with the same effort at various distances measured up to 35MPH difference, depending on release point and pressure.Assuming you modify your release technique and mechanics, you should be able to get a generally (~20-30MPH accurate) correct reading by averaging several throws.If you want to measure pitching speed accurately, don't waste your money and buy a radar gun instead. If you want a party gimmick, these balls (sold under many brandnames) are a good buy."
4,Nice little band,"Some Dusty is nice Carpenter's/Bacharach influenced pop. The album was made a few years ago, but sounds like it comes out of 1974. Nice organnic production, no digital sheen, lots fender rhodes paino and trumpets tooting along. The singer has a nice clean voice and the songs sound like old AM radio singles.A nice little buy if you want to get yourself a present but don't know what. It won't blow you away, but it is always good to have this on the shelf."
3,Jennings brigade,"The only reason, that I purchased the book, is because I'm related to Gen. Benning.I, wanted to read up on his history.My husband is a history buff, so he enjoyed it more than me."
1,Frustrating and ill-conceived,"This is a bad language book. It is supposed to be for people with some French background, but even the first chapter of the book shows that it would fail for most. The first chapter deals with cognates and provides a seemingly useful list of changes (e.g. ""quer"" often changes to ""cate"" endings in English). Then after a score of these rules there are translation/guessing exercies which, one would think, make use of these rules. Sadly, only two of the 31 words exclusively follow the guidelines provided. Moreover, the authors don't seem to be able to communicate well in English through their table, so how can they be expected to actually teach someone else French?"
2,Terrible.,"I bought this product cause my phone looked like a mess. They shipped it pretty fast, first thing I see when I open in...a KAZR case instead of the LG Chocolate. I emailed them and they replied saying they will fix the problem. They fixed it in a way by sending another case that was for the chocolate, but what do you know? its this ugly piece of [...] that was covered with leather which already happened to be ripping. I only rated this product 2 stars for the fast reply and shipping."
5,Great Debut!,"I was going to work one day and heard ""Razorblades"" on the radio. Who's that, gotta get it. I wasn't disapointed. Track 2 is my favorite ""Lucifer & Jane"" This is a must buy for all you CSN fans. ""Hey Steve he's good""!"
2,Nothing Remarkable,Sounds a lot like the less folk-influenced CSN music being sung by the vocalists from the Steve Miller Band.
1,Very very poor!,"Heard a lot about this guy and bought the cd without listening. Man, what a disappointing piece of crab. The music is poor and the songs didn't keep me awake. Don't try."
5,Excellent photography,IMHO one can't beat black and white photography. This movie is very crisp and clear while the sound is also to be marveled at.
4,War,Not a very well known Word War II movie. Had good action and good performances by the major cast members.
5,Ticonderoga?,"Thank you for all the reviews and commentary! Can anyone confirm that the filming of this movie took place on Ticonderoga? My father flew an SBD on that ship, and told me once that he was in the background of a movie starring Erol Flynn! He never saw the movie, but putting two and two together, this has to be the film. I have a photo of the wardroom (?) taken July 7th, 1944 and Captain Dixie Keifer's signature confirming same, and it sure looks the same."
1,GOOD WAR MOVIE,This film is a classic with a believable storyline. If you like fast paced WWII movies..get this one.
1,Worst of All Time,"If anyone pays attention to the ""plot"" (or LACK thereof) the plot of the film is so implausible as to be laughable! No ships' Captain would EVER offer his ship and his men to be a sitting duck without first making certain his pilots were trained and under orders to shoot first and ask questions later, rather than BEG to be killed. Also, this film apparently did not have any military consultants. The pilots were swapping aircraft types in mid-air and the ship kept changing from one to another. This film was HILARIOUS!"
3,title and movie don't go togeather,"When I was little in about 1945 I saw a movie with B-25s flying out of England to Europe. An aircraft had lost an engine and returning home,the crew was singing this song . They looked out and saw the field like the song says. This song does not go with the JET AIRCRAFT mission. I am retired A.F."
2,This is a book of lists,"This really is a handbook of sacramentals. It lists (in a somewhat boring way) different sacramentals, such as medals, scapulars and rosaries. Be sure that you are interested about sacramentals, this is not a book of different customs or traditions!"
2,Standard Chuck Norris,"Delta Force 2 was released when Chuck Norris stardom has faded so not many people saw it in theatres. About a special unit invading a south America drug lord. The action sequences are pretty good. Chuck Norris fans will be happy. Too bad the DVD is very disappointing. No wide screen, No Dolby Digital 5.1 and no special features. The picture quality is about average and the Dolby Surround sound is OK but overall it is a disappointing DVD."
5,cousinpaco's top action: #8,"By all other standards, this movie ain't so hot. From an action-flick standpoint, this movie ROCKS.Plot = Chuck Norris fighting a South American drug dealer and his private army.There's some atrocity-payback, and a whole lot of flying fists, kicks and elbows.Two moments in particular stand out:1. Chuck going one-on-one against a henchman, teaching him Lessons Number One and Two. Both involve pummeling.2. Chuck training a bunch of recruits in a circle of pain. One poor sap even gets a head-plant into the dirt -- I'm not entirely sure it's a stunt.Bottom line: while not necessarily a fine example of cinema, ""DF2"" is a perfect Saturday afternoon diversion. The DVD isn't exactly packed with bonus features, but at least you can slow-mo the fight scenes."
5,"Drug Lords Beware, Chuck-A-Roo is armed and dangerous",Chuck Norris is back and armed and dangerous again. He's still part of the elite Delta Force however with a different commander and new members in his unit.Chuck Norris and his Delta Force are sent to burn cocaine fields and save the CIA operatives captured by the ruthless drug lord Romone Coda (Billy Drago from Charmed and the Untouchables). All this equals great action as Chuck Norris also gets revenge for Coda killing his budy and fellow Delta Force member.Chuck Norris also has a bit of humor throughout the movie. Billy Drago is always at his best when he plays an evil character. This is a great action movie and for those who are Chuck-aholics.
2,No surprises in this film strictly for die hard Norris fans,"This Lackluster sequal to the ""DELTA FORCE"" and it basically fails because it repeats all the same action from the original and Lee Marvin was the missing link, without him the film just flopped. Chuck Norris is just going through what's left of his ailing career with this miserable installment as Norris leads his team of gun happy commandos to Latin America to take out a drug lord."
3,Endurable.,"I've never actually seen the original,but number 2 serves it's purpose excitingly enough. The action scenes are quite well handled,the pace goes at a suitable rythem and Chuck Norris is a brilliant action star. The only trouble is the real good bits are quite few and far between."
1,NOTHING EXCITING AND INTERESTING AS THE FIRST ONE!!!,"MAN! I remember the first Delta Force movie. it was SOOO interesting and action-packed!! It had motorcycles loaded with misiles, bazookas, bulletfests, explotions, suspense, lots of explosive gadgets, car chases and it was directed by Menahem GOLAN.BUT THIS ONE!!!... It doesn't have action until the ending, there are NO cool explosive gadgets, the story is not that interesting and suspensful, the guns were not soo impresive, and Chuck Norris was a little scared because the only thing he did was shot a FEW enemies for self defense and running away while the rest of the team blow the bad guys up.The only good thing was maybe that Chuck had a couple of hand-fights but they were not THAT cool anyway.P.S: If you like the images of the war in the jungle like Missing in Action or Rambo 2 then you may find this movie interesting, but if you are looking for a cool action-packed sequel for Delta Force then this one is NOT for you.Adios."
1,This movie is terrible!,"Don't get me wrong, I usually enjoy a Chuck Norris film. However, this is not just a terrible film for him, but possibly the worst movie ever made. Get anything, ANYTHING other then this. Please don't blow your money on a movie as bad as this. From the dreadful acting, to the horrible ""action"" sequences, this is a total and complete stinker!"
1,Delta Doofus,"Delta Force 2 is vastly inferior to the original 1986 movie, mainly because it does involve any missile-launching motorcycles or dune buggies. In fact, I gave it one star only because there was nothing lower. It is incredibly boring and has worse acting than a soap opera. In all honesty, the original didn't have much better acting; however, it managed to throw me to the floor in violent convulsions of uncontrolable laughter when Chuck Norris launched what appeared to be model rockets from a motorcycle at a very surprised terrorist in a pickup truck. Delta Force 2 featured mostly a bunch of people being stabbed in a very agonizing manner, or in one special case, being gassed and shouting profanities on his painful way to death. The most action I saw while lapsing back and forth from sleep was Chuck Norris climbing up a mountain, only to be attacked by a snake (how it got there is quite a mystery). Buy the original Delta Force."
3,This is atypical.,"I thought this book was very funny. There are 100's of hedge funds in New York. As a hedge fund analyst for several years, I've met Cramer and his analysts. None of them are very impressive or knowledgeable. Since his research was so sloppy and he tried to be an expert on everything, Cramer never had the information or confidence to take a stand.Cramer's great talent is in taking something simple like a bull market and making it seem complicated and confusing. He day traded technology during a bull market. Hard to lose money doing that. The constant yelling and screaming didn't make him any money.99% of hedge fund managers don't yell. 99% of them don't work on Fridays, take summers off and spend time in the gym and with family. Cramer is interesting because he is the renegade yelling child. But he's no child prodigy, just a whiny kid who may need a diaper change."
5,Psycho Trader!!,"If you're naive enough to think that Wall Street is anything but an insider's game, read TRADING WITH THE ENEMY and have your illusions shattered once and for all. This brief rip puts you in the seat next to Jim Cramer as he screams and threatens his way to a fortune. As you'll see, this is one cat who'll do anything to make a buck. And, while it's extremely entertaining to read about a guy who smashes computer equipment, throws pencils at secretaries, insults colleagues and manipulates stock prices, you come away feeling that he's the kind of toxic human being you'd never want to spend more than five minutes with in real life. How Maier spent five years with him, I'll never know.At least he got a terrific book out of it."
5,I KNOW THE TRUTH NOW THANKS TO MAIER,"The Cramer team, the lawyers and spin masters working for the hundred million dollar media creation James J Cramer, want you to think that it's all lies, lies, lies. But the NY Times reports ""two former employees have already corroborated the story,"" and Cramer, who initially claimed Maier was ""fired"" has retracted that statement. Forbes says there's already an SEC investigation going on. See how one media figure manipulated the little guy at home for huge personal profits."
1,Parts of book already retracted -- Embarassing,"See March 31, 2002, New Yort Times article ""Close and Personal In a Media Maelstrom""HarperCollins is pulping 4000 books and sending errata slips to bookstores which hold the book on their shelves.Embarassing for HarperCollins.--------Some parts are funny but the author's ""facts"" can't be trusted -- already retracted the juiciest part (that dealing with the claim that Western Digital gave Insider info to Cramer)."
1,Don't be a fool,"This book constitutes an attempt to cash in on a four-year relationship with Jim Cramer. In reality, Nicholas Maier never got close enough to Cramer to come up with any interesting information we couldn't find on the book's cover. Only a fool what compare this author to Michael Lewis while purchasing this book."
3,"A quick read, but nothing profound...","There are any number of ""characters"" in the investment management business, Mr. Maier's depiction of Jim Cramer as an obscene, arrogant, compulsive bully is a depiction of one of types that you will meet if you work there. As someone who has worked in the biz, there is nothing profound or revealing in Mr. Maier's book except that he portrays Mr. Cramer as one of the most extreme of the gendre. The yes men, the keep your head down, the compulsive personality, etc. are all real in many companies.There is nothing profound in this book. It is a bit of a ""Kiss And Tell"" about someone that most folks know from his appearances in the media. Reasonably written, it is a book you might want to read if you have a summer vacation."
4,Entertaining!,"I laughed my [rear] off reading this book. It was F-U-N-N-Y! I felt bad for the author, Nick Maier, who was obviously in an inappropriate job, totally unsuitable to his personality and academic background. I'm a Cramer fan, so I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Read the book, and have some fun!"
5,"Mr. Yodhia Antariksa, Jakarta, Indonesia","I am a fan of Jim Cramer...and this book enables me to understand more comprehensively about Jim's behaviors. Overall, this book is excellent, blended beautifully between sad and happy/funny stories. I wish Nick could have written more about his peers, Mark and Sal, and why the guys were fired. Anyway, I love this book. Thanks, Nick; and have a better life in the future!"
2,The Story of the Also-Rans,"This book appears to be a knock-off of the feisty, both enthralling and appalling ""Confessions of a Street Addict"" by James Cramer. Cramer admits that he's not a very nice guy to work with, but he can write and tell a story. Nicholas Maier whose only claim to fame is that he knew a friend of Cramer's which got him his job, for which he did not appear to be very talented, and he leaves at the end to go back to his family, much richer, thanks to Cramer, and he would lead us to believe wiser. Cramer at least has passion for his work. Mr. Maier seems only to have sour grapes. It's not a good read. His book only confirms Cramer's account of himself, but Cramer's account is much more compellingly written, even suspenseful. Mr. Maier should have quit sooner and should not have bothered to write this sorry little tale."
2,Tough to decide who I dislike more...,"As portrayed in the book, Jim Cramer is one of the most loathsome figures on Wall Street. The only slight mitigating factor is that Cramer appears to be a text-book bipolar personality and therefrore pity rather than hatred seems the more appropriate emotion in his case. Unfortunatly for the reader, Maier is hardly a sympathetic charater either. Maier fed at Cramer's trough for years never having had the courage to stand up for himself, his co-workers or his friends (especially his lifelong friend Marty Peretz). Maier's public attack and betrayal of Cramer (and partner Jeff Berkowitz) with a kiss-and-tell book is so, well...Crameresque. However, unlike Cramer, Maier cannot plead the insanity defense.Stick to Liar's Poker if you want a good, funny inside Wall Street book..."
4,rare look inside,"Just finished reading this book - makes a good read, could not put it down. Contains pretty good description of methods with which Jim Cramer made his incredible returns. Actually, it is a sad story - the author used his position of being a son of a good friend of the main investor to get this job, and Jim Cramer made a mistake of giving him a job. Both paid dearly - Nick Maier - by working in hell for 5 years, and Cramer - by having him exposed. Usually books like this are not being written because when major Wall Street firms fire people, they make the severance package conditioned on a commitment not to write a book, a movie, etc. Jim Cramer made a mistake, so we can have a look inside."
3,"OK, but gets repetitive","Maier has written a somewhat interesting book here; it's not as bad as some here have said, but then again, Cramer's new autobiography is better, longer, and has a wider perspective. Maier's basic central theme is that the 5 years he spent working for the maniacal hedge-fund manager Jim Cramer was very difficult. He fills page after page with stories of Jim's maniacal antics and rages, which gets repetitive after a while. But in between those descriptions, he describes the inner workings of Cramer's hedge fund, from a grunt's perspective. There aren't a lot of insights here about the market -- it's mostly a tale about how Maier learned to survive while learning about how the market really works."
1,I'd rather not read lies,"Even HarperCollins retracted what Maier made up. The book would have been more interesting if portions of it weren't made up for effects. Now I find it hard to believe the rest of the stories, or the whining. Please! A boss that yelled at you, even day in and day out, is not enough material for a book.Search on credible sites such as bloomberg.com for details."
3,Disclaimer Does Not Make The Case ...,"Stuck inside the front cover pages of ""Trading With The Enemy - Seduction And Betrayal on Jim Cramer's Wall Street"" is a playing card sized disclaimer regarding insider information and trades of Western Digital.The apparently hastily placed, breathless disclaimer adds balast to Nicholas W. Maier's snitch story. Remember that line from Shakespeare that goes something like this: He protests too much.Anon more methinks and hopes."
1,Sour Grapes,"First read ""Trader75's review. He says everything much better than I can.Second, the whole book is summed up this way: Maier is upset that Cramer (may have) yelled at him. Anyone who has ever worked on Wall Street, especially a trading room, knows this is par for the course. Maier goes on and on for 200 pages how Cramer yelled. As the publisher has already admitted the fabrication of some details (WDC insider trading) one, must take everything that is said with a grain of salt.Third,there is no character developement-none-all characters are presented as one dimensional.The book is a waste of money.Finally, I would like to comment on some of the reviews other people have left. Some, not all, have grudges to bear with Jim Cramer. Why? My guess is because Cramer has made recommendations that have gone against them and lost these reviewers money, probably on several occasions. I also woulnd't be surprised if one person left more than one review."
4,A Rare Find,"I found this book enjoyable and interesting. I am thankful that there are those who are willing to be explorers, and I am thankful that there are authors who can write their stories for all of us to enjoy. This is a rare find if you want to read about expedition kayaking. It moves like a whitewater river. It's not all rapids. Sometimes you have to float in an eddy while the author gives you some historicial perspective before the next plunge. Sure it could have been shorter, but then we would never have known these men well enough to appreciate why they did what they did. I don't see this as an extreme sport outing anymore than the Lewis and Clark expedition. These men are modern day explorers in an uncharted world who met with tragedy. This is their story."
2,Horribly written,"While the subject matter itself is very interesting, Todd Balf is a substandard writer. Much of his writing contains vocabulary terms that are unknown to 99% of Americans (who knew there was a glossary at the back?). Furthermore, Balf's writing is amateurish even if he is judged against other ""journalistic"" authors. I expected this to be a page turner, but instead found myself trudging on in order to finish. Balf has no idea how to create any sense of suspense in his writing, which, in the end, is part of the purpoose of this book."
2,Why compare kayaking to climbing?,"I have read this book recently, and couldn't stop wondering about the fact that Todd Balf keeps writing about climbing. His book is about kayaking! Athough he gives a lot of information about the preperations of the trip and the characters of the people who joined, I just missed extensive descriptions on the actual kayaking on the river. As a kayaker, it's always interesting to read about kayaking, but I expected more."
5,love it,this has helped me to make sense of a lot of things--am going thru some bad stuff and when i listen to this it helps to bring things into prospective.
2,Talented Musician That Should Team With An Equally Talented Vocalist,"I saw Lili Haydn open for Jimmy Page and Robert Plant at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. She was outstanding live. Original sound, extremely talented and a lot of energy. After searching relentlessly for a studio album I couldn't have been more disappointed. Her talent on the violin is obvious but her voice is horrible and she simply can't sing. This cd could have been a big hit if she had teamed up or even hired a studio vocalist."
4,Captivating Artist,"In 1997 I went to the Page/Plant ""Clarksdale"" tour concert in Tampa, FL. and to my pleasant surprise a young talented artist named Lili Haydn opened that show. Although the mix was a little muddled the 45 minute set showed great promise. I searched for her debut album ""Lili"" and once found was delighted in hearing the studio version which was played live that night. While her vocals may not be that of a Natalie Imbruglia, Fiona Apple, etc. her arrangements and violin playing more than make up for that. ""Stranger"" is a fine rock single. ""Real"" and ""Take Somebody Home"" are also great rock formula songs. Not since early Kansas has the violin been used to such a great degree. There are a lot of female artists out there that play some guitar and sing to varying degree of quality but I'll venture to say there is not too many out there with the song writing and violin playing skills like Lili out there. Take a listen!!"
3,"A promising style, but not a great album","Attempting to stuff the violin into a position other than ""background music"" or backup in the rock genre is very impressive. However, her songs seems to be unpolished. I look forward to her sophomore album, but for now I adhere to Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco."
5,Math Power makes EVERYONE love math!,"I bought it to be able to help my grandson. Ms. Kenschaft changed MY 60-year-old attitude against math. Her clear presentation in ordinary words sparked an interest and gave me hope that I just might be able to understand more. She is a master teacher and a master writer.The book gives practical illustrations, examples and hints that coach even the most handicapped in math dare to believe that there is a way to understand math and use it.I gossipped so excitedly about the book that two people bought their own copies and three people checked it out of the library.This is a book that will be helpful to classroom teachers and homeschool teachers."
3,In Whose Best Interest?,"I almost had a nervous breakdown just reading this book. Herman's writing for three quarters of the book is about herself and ""restless"" does not begin to describe the way she analyzes relationships. It's tedious and self-indulgent. The most interesting parts of the book is when she describes her daughter and the ""breakdown"". I will give her credit for being brutally honest about herself. As a mother, the most interesting thing said in the book is the criteria the doctor recommended when deciding what actions to take: ""Is this for you or for her?"" So in using this guideline, how wise is it to publish a book on your own child's psychological problems? A child who is probably still under 18 and cannot consent? How will she feel having such personal issues being aired out by the mother that actually caused them? How is this benefiting the child?"
5,razr,best thing i bought great cover has saved my phone many times. I bought a few and i mix the colors.
2,Worth the price,"This case is worth the price I paid. The rubberized coating over the plastic started peeling off the first day. I just rubbed and peeled it off, and I'm still using the case to protect my phone: doesn't look too bad. It's still an ok case to protect your phone. It is not the highest quality, but for the price it is just fine for me. Fits perfectly on my phone. Overall, not too bad."
5,Bursting with hits!,"Really a great collection of country (and crossover pop) hits of that time! Jose Cuervo and You're The Reason God Made Oklahoma are just outstanding, and still sound fresh today. A very nice comp with a good selection of hits."
4,Good,"Very nice older game which includes the original game Shattered Kingdoms. The graphics aren't up to today's standards, but they are crisp and clean and still hold up well. Nice soundtrack and fun gameplay make this a winner with lots of replay ability. Do not pay $100 to some of the people selling the hard copy of this game. It is indeed very rare, but if you do a search for it, you can find a ton of sites that you can download the game from for under 10 bucks."
3,There is no mood in this book.,"To make it simple: The quality of the paper, the fonts, and even the general layout are mostly shabby. I mean, It looks like they've used Arial 12 and printed it out in a cheap ream without the minimal sense of taste. It is not confectionated with love. Moreover, the HUGE SIZE of this book is at the end a totally killer experience."
2,"Wonderful, but a little pointless and a little inaccurate","I picked this up in a bookshop, flicked through, put it down.Why would a BoB obsessive like me not want to buy this?Firstly, in the first song I looked at (""Moonlight"") there was a spelling mistake (""levy"" for ""levee""). So it's not accurate.Secondly, all of the songs are on line at bobdylan.com, with a great search for pulling all the songs using a particular word or phrase, and spelled correctly.Thirdly, it's grotesquely overpriced and too large to take anywhere.Seems to me that Simon and Schuster are trying to recoup on the huge advance for the Memoirs by ripping people off with this not-very-well-produced tome.But the words, of course, are wonderful! So a star for that."
3,"new book, not well packaged... came dented","this was a gift and the ""new"" book was just wrapped in paper. corners got dented in the mail :( otherwise great deal!"
1,Bob Dylan Lyrics 1962-2001 review,"I don't know. It seems a lot of the lyrics on Blood on the Tracks are off and from the original NY demosWhich had different lyrics from what came out on the official release (Dylan rerecorded some tracks during the winter with some other musicians, and they're the best tracks on the album)Kind of upsets me that the lyrics for a lot of the Blood tracks are not the ones from the actual album. Thanks a whole lot Knopf!"
1,Inaccurate Description,This book claimed it had lyrics that it actually didn't have. Now I own a $30 book that I can never use. I'm very disappointed in the seller of this product.
4,Obsolete? Maybe not...,"I had the first edition, which covered up to '85. I recall the book was quite an event at the time, and yes, pricey, but this was pre-web days and, for all the inaccuracies, it was still impressiveto read through. Dylan's words, more than most songwriters, work on a number of levels as prose/poetry as well as lyric (there's a real difference, as any good lyricist/songwriter can tell you). I can understand the reviewer who wonders how the cost can be justified now when more complete versions are available online for free. I can only suggest that, for the majority of Dylan fans who came of age in those murky pre-internet years (not to mention Amazon's accountants), there's still a strong attraction to words on paper and the romance of books."
5,Every Dylan fan needs this book!,"As a very long-time Dylan fan, I absolutely love this book! It even has the outtakes from all the recording sessions, I know because I also own Bob Dylan: The Complete Discography, which I also strongly recommend. Every Dylan fan should have both!"
1,A major disappointment,I bought this cd without listening to it thinking it would be as good as the previous year (soca gold 2003). What a disappointment. Not one single track worth listening to. Don't waste your money. One star is being too generous.
4,PASSED BROKER'S W/88%(LAW) AND 83%(GENERAL)1st time,"One example of this book's superiority is its section on mortgages, financing residential properties, and on possible forms of ownership. I have been in the real estate industry in one capacity or another since the early 70's and this is the best book presentation I've seen. It is concise, easily understood, but contains a lot of information. My only frustration with the book was that as it was not state specific, I had to rely on a local publication for that which was full of errors and inadequacies so I had to constantly also go to my law dictionary and business law book and text books from my paralegal courses to refresh my memory on details specific to my state. Granted, I may not be 'usual' as I am also a paralegal etc. but on the other hand, I only reviewed for parts of 2 1/2 days, so was relatively satisfied with my exam scores."
1,Hard time using this to study,I had a hard time using this book to study for the appraisal exam and didn't find it useful to me. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
3,I USED MR. JOHN A. TIRONE's HP-12C BOOK TO STUDY,"i USED A real estate calculations book for the Hewlett packard HP-12C calculator authored by a real estate instructor/author by the name of John A. Tirone. John's book is called Professional Real Estate Problem Solving Using the HP-12C and amazon carries the book.The most treacherous part of the appraisal exams is the calculations and no book other than the Tirone book does the field in a manne rthat you can easily understand. The Tirone book lays things out truly in a step by step manner. and, add to it that Tirone can be called with questions on the calculations in the book, etc, it is pretty much a must for all of us who are taking the appraisal and brokers exams."
4,Strong sound,When I ordered this product I also ordered a few similar items. This one has the strongest crisp sound of all the instruments I've purchased. My 1yr old & 3yr love it.
4,Decent little toy,My daughter is in a tribal drumming class and this was about as primitive as you can get for a percussion instrument. Seems solid and the price was right.
5,Enjoy Christian Rock? Buy This,"These guys have a real heart for the Lord! A wide sample of sounds on this debute album, from heavy to soft these guys rock. I can never tired of this album and can pop it in any day and worship the Lord to it. Don't delay, pick this up!"
5,When you have it you have it and boy do these guys have it!,"From the hard rocking song Tonight to the soft and spirit filled track Grace and Love this album is a must have. If you could only buy one album this year, this is the one to have."
1,One Good Song,"""Run"" is a great song. Unfortunately the rest of the album is just a bad rock album. Nothing interesting, nothing new, nothing that strikes you as good. So a bad debut for Kutless, which makes since since self-titled albums usually turn out bad anyways. Relient K, Kutless, Lifehouse, all turned out bad. This is no exception."
5,awesome,I've listened to this CD so many times... I love it especially when I have a long drive. The words are deep and the music is LOUD... just like I like it!
5,This cd is great!,I bought this cd about a month back before it was offically released. I have listened to it all the time since then.It is one of those rare cd's that is enjoyable the first listen through and all future tune in's. They have a great sound and clarity to there lyrics. I hope to hear more from this group down the road. Go buy this cd if you like some rock in the tune of puddle of mudd and staind(there alot better though)
5,Finally a great no name christian band to listen to,"There are all these no name christian bands and they are all lame and you never hear from they again. these guys rule and i love the whole cd from beginning to finish, i can t stop listening to them and are very encouraging. God loves all the time."
3,"Not for me, but..","This CD is a little too traditional Christian for me, at least with the lyrics. They have a lot in common with Switchfoot, and I feel that if you enjoy Switchfoot's CD (not just their great hits) then you will like this CD. I am the type who will prefer Christian music like 12 Stones who don't direct their lyrics at God, unlike Kutless. They scream a little but that doesn't bother me, so if you listen to your local new rock stations you will be familiar with that. There is a little rapping, so it is kind of like Linkin Park except Christian (and in my opinion not as good). While this CD does not appeal to me, I do not count for everyone who does/will listen to it."
1,no imagination,"This disc lacks imagination. They sound Creed like but they are a wee bit softer. I dont like this music anymore but when I did I failed to realize that Kutless lacks meaning in their songs. I mean look at the titles Down, Away, Tonight. Not that these songs are confusing metaphors like some Christian rocker""s songs are. These songs lack depth and creativity. And the music sounds like any other band out today.I would stay away from this. Listen to Creed instead"
4,COOL,"cool, but i'm more of an EVANESCENCE FAN and a LINKIN PARK fan. but i do like this CD very much ^_^. I love Skillet a lot though ^_^."
4,"Very Simple, yet very inspiring","I listen to this when I want to hear worshipfull music that isn't so soft. They are not the most talented or original band, but their simplicity is beautiful when the Holy Spirit moves through you while listenting to their songs. I think I would appreciate them more if I saw them live. I like all of the songs except New Years Vow. Its just a lame things to write a song about. I think Kutless has potential, but also a long way to come musically. Lyrically, they are awesome and to the point. Thank God for them! Pray that their wittness would reach out to those who do not believe."
5,Good stuff!,"This is a great cd! Awesome music, very good lyrics, and altogether really well made with an excellent sound. Sounds a lot like Creed -- not so much as to make it not very Christian, but enough to be a good substitute for Creed. All in all, definitely one of the best Christian bands I've heard out there. If you like these guys, try out someone like Pillar(or vice versa)."
1,Aaron Sprinkle what are you doing?,"Aaron Sprinkle must be broke or something. Why he continues to work with Kutless is totally mind blowing. This band sucks! Everything they do is terrible. If you know anything about music, you know these guys are the worst"
2,My Soapbox,"Okay, everyone, I have never actually heard this album so I won't attempt to critique it. However, I would like to ask a question: How many more bands that sound like Creed will have to emerge before people have had enough? There are so many groups out there right now with pounding guitars and a tough-sounding lead singer that my head spins trying to keep them all straight. The Calling, Pearl Jam, Plumbline, Alice in Chains... they all sound the same. In my humble opinion, it's high time that a little creativity, originality, and interest be pumped back into the music scene, Christian or otherwise. So nothing personal, but I think your money could probably be better spent somewhere else, perhaps on one of the countless immensely talented bands who never see the light of day, because no one bothers to make a pseudo-grunge product out of them."
3,"Beautifully written, but lacking in personal responsibility.","In reviewing this title, do you admire the clarity of Harrison's language or scorn the muddled logic of her interpretation of what happened? Her writing is superb (if a bit excessive in its mournfulness...who could blame her?). But there's something horribly disturbing at the center of this memoir, and it's not just the monster who is her father. At times, Harrison seems to acknowledge the role she played in the most-dysfunctional relationship she had with her father. Other times, she seems to make herself a victim. While she certainly was ""abused"" by her father, she was 20 years old when the affair began, not an innocent child unable to control her environment. This must have been a wrenching book to write; otherwise, we might have had more background on her relationship with her grandparents and her mother. Instead, coverage of those aspects of her life is cursory as we're made to wallow in the darkest aspects of her younger life."
1,The slowest kiss ever,"Touchy topic, but if you can handle reading about a father molesting his twenty year old daughter, than try this one. But don't expect a story that moves a long. How can you critique a memoir, well it's not the true story that is the problem. You come to understand, and empathize how this yong girl was able to allow her father to start doing this at such an old age. But here is the problem with this book. It took me some time to read it. I could only muddle through 10-15 pages at a time.I write poetry so naturally i like metaphors, but this book is so filled with metaphors that if it was a person talking it would almost be sickening to hear. I just didn't really enjoy it, and i thought it was exhausting. Just a overuse of metaphors, and unessesary comparrisons out of nowhere as if she is struggling to make this dark story even more dark.Would definately not recommend this to anyone."
1,Unreadable,"When I picked up this book, I thought it would be an interesting. Hell, having an affair with your dad is as messed up as it gets. The way Harrison writes is very annoying and distracted me from the main point. Apparently, she thinks describing everything around her constitutes a plot. I read a couple of chapters and couldn't go on."
4,Not deserving of the derision it engendered from some,"This is a beautifully written and constructed memoir, a work of art, not a work of calculated exploitation. Its use of present tense, flashbacks-and-forwards, and description are cinematic-- has anyone written a screenplay of this book? Someone should. Those reviewers who criticize Harrison for a lack of dimensionality in the characterizations of her parents and grandparents should remember that this is not a novel, however novelistic it seems. This voice is not omniscient; in fact, for much of the years described she is a sleepwalker in a nightmare, and a child at that. The book is very successful at capturing the essence of this experience from its author's tortured point of view."
2,Huh?,"I fail to see the purpose of this book. What did the author want to accomplish by writing it? I hate to come across as cold and unsympathetic, but I find it hard to call what transpires ""abuse"". Abuse is what happens to children who are helpless to defend themselves or to know that a wrong is being committed against them. As a young women that grew up without a father, in a not-so-stable home myself, I feel somewhat justified in saying that all the author needed to do was stay away from her father to prevent this tragedy.Aside from the topic of the book, I did not enjoy Ms. Harrison's style of writing. I enjoy good writing, am not a ""Jackie Collins or Danielle Steel kind of reader"" (no offense to any that are fans of these authors) yet I found this book boring and difficult to finish. Bottom line: save your money. This book is not as intriguing, nor is the author as sympathetic as you might think."
4,Deeply Moving,"""The Kiss"" by Kathryn Harrison is an amazingly powerful and intense book. The subject matter of incest is difficult to take, but it's done so honestly and with such poignancy that it allows the reader to be interested without judgement. Like other reviewers have said, I also saw similarities to ""Lolita"" but, this seems to hold a different tone on many levels. It's clear this book is not for everyone and it takes a certain sense of maturity to understand and appreciate it, but aside from the dramatic storyline, it's a wonderful novel."
2,Paging Joan Didion...,"My rating is based on the intrinsic literary merits of the book, not the moral stature of the author. (Just for the record: I would have an easier time respecting this as ""an act of courage"" if the author hadn't inched her way up to it through several earlier fictions, as if she were performing a striptease, and let no one equate the victimization of a defenseless child with the legally - and, one would hope, ethically - responsible actions of a 20 year old woman.) It's written in stark prose that aspires to the taut suggestiveness of Joan Didion or (more likely, given Harrison's penchant for glamour) Marguerite Duras but is more often merely flat and affectless. This may be an after-effect of surviving incest but this isn't a diary we're reading, it's purportedly ""literature"", and it must be judged accordingly."
5,The Kiss is very engaging particularly for survivors of incest themselves,Katheryn knows how to describe her experience of participating in a family taboo. Her eloquence and honesty makes this a book that can't be put down. I only wish there was more! It's kind of a let down and I don't know if her other books are as intriguing.
4,A novel of under discussed subject; incest.,"The novel was very daunting and at times very difficult to read, especially when the deppresion changed her entire life. I felt it was a very direct and truthful account of the seduction and venerability of a woman whom had never felt loved or even noticed by her family."
2,Cha-ching!,"Kathryn Harrison milks incest for all its worth in this drab memoir, and I don't doubt it paid off handsomely. Readers, on the other hand, are likely to feel robbed. Harrison's involvement, for one thing, is too close for her to have any perspective, and her whining, pity-me tone cuts no ice. The story by itself is not without interest; it just needs a real writer."
2,"Great writer, horrifically disturbing.","Let me shoot straight to the point. The book was astoundingly disturbing. The funny thing is, I can understand where she would feel the need to have done what she done. However, to keep obssessing about incest, as she does with her other books, just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I thought I was in for some heart wrenching revelations about the human mind. She didnt really delve into the emotional aspects about the wanting and lack of relationship she had with her mother above all. I honestly, got the creeps just reading more into her story and its truly not inspiring in any way. The saddest part of her book was when she dreamed of her mother. THAT was sad. But the other stuff just struck me as shock value. It was too convoluted. All I can say is that she is messed up mentally and emotionally from her truly sick family. I wouldn't touch this with a 3 ft. poll."
1,Not Worth It,"The synopsis of this book left be hopeful, but reading it left me disappointed.It is very hard to sympathize with the character, which is amazing since she is supposed to be a victim. However, this book is completely unbelievable and a sorry read at that.I felt like I was cheated and forced to read rubbish after I was through."
2,huh?,"Forget for a moment the subject matter. The storytelling is very confusing. Flashing back. Flashing forward. And she offers readers very little in terms of guidance. I had heard many things about Ms. Harrison's work. Sadly, only the weakest were true"
4,An intimate look into a girl's experience with men,"This book goes beyond telling a story of the injustice of incest but gives a revealing view of what young women grow up experiencing from a world where men knowingly or unknowlying abuse and exploit women for their own self-gratification and self-esteem. This book more accurately depicts how men are no longer our ""knights in shining armor"" but now are really selfish, grown up babies. I would definitely recommend this book to any naive girls who's hearts have been broken more than once by men and still don't understand why."
4,Better than expected,"I approached this book thinking it was yet another attempt of an author making a sensational admission to attract attention, and I was happily surprised. The style was wonderful and most of the subject matter powerful and intriguing. The short sections such as those that described the white sands in New Mexico, and the drawing and symbolism of the two circles are just too good to say this book is anything short of a wonderful, thought-provoking read. I think that if the dark parts of the mother's death near the end were given less attention (already gone into in detail in a previous work Thicker Than Water) and more time was devoted to rationalizing the relationship primarily with the father, the book would have felt to me more complete. It's clear the mother's death played a significant part in the final outcome, but I had a hard time justifying so much explanation re: the mother-daughter relationship, which really only skirts the issue."
5,Hanover 100 calorie packs,I like this product because it is an easy to stay on your diet. It is also a great snack for the children anytime of the day.
3,Mini Pretzels,"I had been looking for these unsalted pretzels for awhile. I try to limit sodium, but love pretzels. I used to live in PA (Snyder's headquarters) and could get them all the time. Since moving to the midwest, I have not been able to find them. I was very disappointed in them when they were shipped. About 1/4 of the bag was pieces and crumbs. Another reviewer mentioned this and I should have known, but I really had been craving pretzels and was hoping that Snyders had fixed their problem with shipping. Pretzels, great; shipping not so goood."
2,disapointed this time,"My first order was perfect, second one, not too much, all the prezels were chipped or broken. lots of crumbs in the bag this time around, not sure if I will re-order."
3,Pricey,I purchased these pretzels pretty often up until now. I came back to make another purchase and find the price has gone up. I will not purchase them unless they return to original price of $19.00.
1,these are pretzels,"These are specified to be Snyder's of Hanover Pretzels Minis 100 Calorie Packs, 10-Count Packages (Pack of 6). However they are bags with 3 servings each, each bag has 330 calories and 3.5 ounce bags. I called twice, my order was re-sent only to find that they are exactly the same. I wanted the 100 calorie pack so I can know exactly what I am eating in a setting. Customer service person seemed foreign and did not understand my concern."
4,Great soundtrack to a very good film...,"The ""Anastasia"" soundtrack was a pleasant surprise. I loved the atmosphere of the ""set up"" songs like track 1, and Rasputin's song, but the standouts are Liz Callaway's songs like ""Journey to the Past"", which is sang with such feeling. Aaliyah's version of ""Journey"" knocked it out of the park, mixing some good r&b into it. Liz's ""Once Upon A December"" is also haunting, and you do wish she'd remember why she sees such visions. And of course ""At The Beginning"" with Donna Lewis and Richard Marx was a huge radio hit, and also a great song. Definately worth a listen."
5,The sound track is fantastic!!!!,I have lisined to the sound track over and over. The movie was great also. I know this might be stange but I have seen the movie Eight times.
5,Amazing!,"This is a great soundtrack! At the Beginning, is the best song I have ever heard!!!! This is a must have."
5,INCREADIBLE!!!!,"The movie was an excellent film!!!! I love the music, and the animation of the movie was some of the best I've ever seen!!! Watch and listen, you'll be amazed!!!!"
3,Quite a nice songs.,"This soundtrack is quite a nice soundtrack though lot of songs are classified as children songs, only some of them are great like: Journey to the past, At the beginning by Richard Marx and Donna Lewis."
4,It has its moments!,"As long as you ignore the awful pop renditions (why did Fox have to follow Disney in that respect?! it's not like they get radio air time any more) of the movie music, this is a great album. ""Once Upon a December"" is especially not to be missed. Finally, Liz Callaway gets to sing something better than the stuff Disney gave her in the Aladdin sequels, and the actors singing Rasputin and Dimitri do a great job. Worth getting, but program your CD player to skip the offensively bad tracks by Aaliyah, Deana Carter, and Thalia. END"
5,Great soundtrack!,"This is one of the best soundtracks that have ever been produced: each song is nice to listen to. I'm glad that there are three versions of the theme song ""Journey to the Past"" (the original by Liz Callaway, which is the best on this album, Aliyah's pop version, and Thalia's Latin salsa version) -- they're all great to listen to, although the best interpretation, done by Lea Salonga (voice of Jasmine and Mulan) in her Christmas concert abroad, can't be heard here.See the movie and get this recording -- you'll enjoy Anastasia!"
5,Why only 5 stars?,"ok......this cd deserves way more than only 5 stars! i can't even count the number of stars it deserves. not only is it the best cd....i am obsessed w/ the movie(and i mean obsessed) the movie, the voices the music(need i say more) i know all the words to the song and the movie. i know everything about it. i practiced all summer to get my drawings to look like the ones from ""Anastasia."" well i don't want to write a whole book here. anyways it only allowes 1,000 words. o well. i hope you enjoy the movie and cd as much as i did. but nobody...and i maen nobody is as obsessed about this movie as i. PERIOD!"
4,Great for people of all ages,"I've had this CD since I was about 7, [am now 13] and I still listen to it.I can't get over how the songs just explode with beauty and grace but also boldness and exitment.For singers, these songs are great warm ups.Grade A material"
2,not really good....,"anastasia soundtrack isn't what it seems to be.aayiah single is not good.she trys to act like christina aguilera's ""relfection"" off the mulian soundtrack.and it also has bunch of kiddie songs on this soundtrack and a free sticker.it's not good."
4,Anastasia Soundtrack,"If you loved the movie then you'll love the soundtrack, delightful and enjoyable. It arrived quickly and in beautiful condition."
5,Absolutely Fantastic!,"When I first saw this movie I was 9. It was so incredible. Now I'm 19 and the movie is still my number 1. I watch it all the time. I only recently bought the soundtrack, but I love it so much! Its beautiful and enchanting. My favorite songs are ""In the Dark of the Night"" and ""A Rumor in St. Petersburg"". Absolutely fantastic. 5 stars."
4,I Love Owning These Songs!!,"My favorite part of the movie ""Anastasia"" is the original songs that my family can sing to throughout the film. The songs are great - some are funny, sad, hopeful - and I'm impressed by the music to match. The soundtrack has a few instrumental pieces that I didn't even realize existed, but are beautiful just the same. Donna Lewis, Aaliyah, and Thalia all contribute their own gorgeous versions of our favorite songs into this generally pleasing soundtrack."
4,"Oh, if only they'd cut the pop tracks...","This CD would be perfect if not for the tracks by Thalia, Aaliyah, and Deana Carter (the Richard Marx/Donna Lewis track, while cheesy, is palatable at least) - the stuff that actually appears in the movie is great. Liz Callaway has a beautiful voice and at last gets to show off with real songs rather than the drivel written for the Aladdin video sequels. ""Once Upon a December"" is the best song written for a movie in 1997, in my opinion (""My Heart Will Go On"" is terrible by comparison). Worth getting, but skip the pop tracks."
3,My four year old loves this book!,"I have to say I found this story a little unusual! A kid finds a talking rock from space, takes it to school and gets laughed at. Then space rock proves himself and everyone thinks the boy is cool! My four year old loves it, they have it at her doctors, we have to look for this book whenever we go. She talks about it for about 2 days after, carries rocks around and thinks this is the best book she's read! I'm a little bewildered, but still she loves it! I'm going to buy a copy from Amazon now."
5,Maturity Explosion,"This is, I would say, what every live concert should be. I was blown away from the very opening to the end. So was the entire audience. Deborah Harry is exploding! She has matured as a singer and performer. No one can deny that. The band has matured and sounds great, too. Awesom energy! The sound is tight, powerful, and very musical. The songs range from rock'n'roll to jazz. You can't expect this good music from a youngster band, NEVER. Deborah Harry, also an actress, is now no ordinary singer. She is a Queen who reigns the stage. You will know what I mean when you see this."
2,Big disappointment,"Unlike the other review, I did not find the similarities with The Big Red Barn to be laudable. It isn't that the style is similar to her other book - that would be fine. No, she practically lifts entire lines from The Big Red Barn. The result is an uneven lyrical quality, like she's trying to tell the story of Christmas but forces in little winks and nods to her other book. Also, it doesn't work that the illustrations clearly show a modern setting (at least a 20th century one), but she keeps referring to an ""ancient barn."" It renders the story historically inaccurate for a telling to children, which is a disappointment. I don't know how anyone possibly thought that modernizing the setting could do anything but serve as a detraction to the quality of this book, and risk insulting the religious sensibilities of some."
1,very disappointed,"We own many Margaret Wise Brown books and love them all. So, when I saw a book about the nativity story, I couldn't resist. I was very disappointed with this book. The rhyming text doesn't flow in my opinion, making it difficult to read. The story is also inaccurate. It is not a book I plan to read often with my children."
3,Not as Good as Brown's Other Works,"This book is a kind of combination of a traditional Nativity retelling and the popular board book Big Red Barn. Brown interweaves familiar phrases fromBIG RED BARNwith the biblical story, as well as phrases from traditional Christmas carols, in her characteristically pleasant, soothing rhythm. The illustrations (both the modern version illustrated by Diane Goode and the original by Barbara Cooney) depict a modern couple having a baby in an American-style barn -- an innovation some parents may love and others may object to. The text doesn't flow as well as Brown's other books, but it's a pretty good one-time read."
1,disappointment,"I am so disappointed in this book and wish I hadn't bought it. Here's why: 1. Is this the Christmas story of the Bible? The setting is modern day on a farm in America based on the house/barn & clothing 2. Mary and Joseph supposedly walked into the barn at the end of the day because ""And two people had lost their way"" - lost their way?? 3. I'd prefer not to use the word ""a**"" for ""donkey"" especially as we don't use that word in polite language and I want to read this to my year old son. 4. The name Jesus is never used in the book. She asks ""What child is this"" and then just calls him ""the child""."
3,Works great but not silent,If your looking for a fan that will cool this is a good one. If your looking for a fan that cools quietly look elsewhere. I have this mounted to the side panel of i believe its and antec 300 case anyway needed something quiet for an htpc build and this was not it. The other fans in the antec case are silent and i need this one to be. So i must look elsewhere for a silent fan. However this fan does cool well just at the cost of some noise.
5,The Anti-Dilbert,"Nicole Grace has used her unique background and business experience to write a fascinating book that covers every aspect of job performance.Surfing the stormy seas of office politics, making an excellent first impression and impeccable attitude and performance are all covered in an exciting, revolutionary system.Every time I'm in a quandary at work, I reach for this book and it has never let me down."
5,How to become Great,"I started reading self-help books at 15. In 25 years, only one other self-help book had has as deep an impact on me as Mastery At Work. I'll give you a hint, the other book was written 80 years ago by Dale Carnegie. I credit Mastery At Work for fostering in me a new career power and joy that was missing before. Plain and simple, this book is for winners, and those who want to learn to be winners."
1,If you like to collect vintage sports books....,"this is great, but it has no practical value. Other boxing instruction books are far superior to this antique. The pictures and comments are a bit humorous but save your money and watch a Charlie Chaplin movie."
4,Celtic Kilts?,"The Chieftains are fabulous Celtic musicians and performers! Whenever the opportunity presents itself to see and hear them in person, GO!!! You will be on your feet most of the concert, dancing in the aisles!That being said, this album is a little more pensive than their usual performance. Beautiful music, perfect for those Burns Dinners. Scots will enjoy this, tho' perhaps with a wee tear in the eye.Good addition to anyone's Chieftains library! <grin>"
5,New to C++ and interested in Windows programming? Start here,"The introduction to C++ part alone is worth the price of the book. I cannot think of a better way to make ""first contact""with C++ for someone who is really new to C++ and maybe to programming at all. The part on Windows programming is starting to be a bit dated (no .NET stuff here) but is well structured, informative and really step-by-step. The style of the book is teaching you by example developing a drawing-sketching application. You will find also useful info on building DLLs and database programming. Be warned this is not a book on MFC! If you are looking for a MFC through treatment and reference look elsewhere! But if you are new to C++ and want to see how it is used to build basic windows apps this book will definitely give you a great foundation."
3,The Example in Using MFC for Window is too complicate,"Up to chapter 12 is very good for beginners( As book title says). But when MFC is introduced with one big example which spans over five chapters, I am already confused with its complexity. It would be better if short many examples were used to build a window with MFC. After all, book's title is ""Beginning..."", which sounds to me ""Beginners..."", but the chapter 13 thru 18( very important part of C++) weren't for beginners at all eventhough the author did very good detailed writing."
2,Not a real-life sample to be found,"I agree with another reviewer who stated ""at the end of the book, I still don't know how to do simple things"". It's impossible to find things you'd use in real-world programming in this book.Take his COM coverage for example: a COM object that determines what the monitor refresh rate is. Who CARES? How about a COM example of exchanging data from one program to another? Granted, COM requires a separate volume to cover, but why even include it if you're going to give us something this useless?If you're learning C++ because you've got a project at work to do, then look for another reference. Simple things like ""_T"" are not even in the index of the book. You'll be searching for answers elsewhere."
2,Should be: Begining Vis. C++ for EXPERIENCED Programmers,"The book is very through in it's treatment of Visual C++. But, isn't for the faint of heart. Ivor doesn't present the subject at a level or in an approach that would be readily understandable by someone w/o a strong programming background. (I've found this to be the case for his other ""Begining"" books as well)If this is your initial foray into learning to program ... don't buy this book (in fact, try another language like VB). You'll be highly disappointed.If you have an extensive background in programming in a Microsoft environment, then this is probably a good book."
3,"good for some, but not for all","If you are a competent C++ programmer, this may not be the best book for. Roughly half of the book is devoted to C++. I would have preferred if the book focused solely on MFC and VC++. That way would have allowed for greater depth and coverage of the very large subject of MFC. Horton did a good job of explaining the example code. The example application which spans multiple chapters is usefull in that it introduces one to handling larger projects in VC++. I cannot comment on the first half of this book as I did not need to read it. This is a good book for someone who needs to learn C++ and intends to go on to the basics of MFC."
3,Not bad....but there are better.,"With a somewhat modest understanding of the C++ language, this book has been very useful as refresher course prior to learning Visual C++. For one who is looking to learn the C++ language, and relies heavily on examples...look elsewhere. These examples do not compile. Just a little over half way through the book and few, if any examples, have compiled without error.For those of you, with an understanding of C++, looking to jump into the VC++ world, this book isn't half bad. For the rest of you, there are better books."
5,Good book for a beginner,"As I read the book, questions were answered as i came up with them. Very informative, explained why things are done, not just telling that is the way it is."
4,A nice Visual C++ book for all level programmer.,"""BEGINNING Visual C++6"" leads you to explore Visual C++ 6 step by step. It not only tell you HOW to do but also show you WHY in windows programming. Advanced topics like OLE server, ActiveX controls are also included. A nice Visual C++ book for all level programmer."
3,Lack of attention to style,"This is a book to get you up and running on Windows programmingin C++, not a book to learn C++ by. The book lacks attention togood programming style. I quote page 80 -""the variable name count1 has been duplicated here only toillustrate what happens, although this code is legal, it isn'ta good approach to programming in general""This quote is in reference to the code presented on pg 79,introducing variable scope.Just as inportant as knowing how to code is knowing how to codeso others can understand what you are doing. The quote abovewas not the first instance, where tha author tell the readerthat the code example he has presented is wrong in terms ofstyle.Other than this the book is well written and the material ispresented well, however this is not a book to pick up if youwant to learn be a programmer."
5,Best Visual C++ 6 Book Ever!,"I would recommend this book to anyone who is starting to program in Visual C++ 6. At first I knew nothing of C++, and after a few weeks of reading and practicing I am on my way of making some very good programs. It was well worth the money. Once again thank you for making my programming dreams come true.A 16 year old high school student, Jackson Nguyen"
3,"Thorough, but at times needlessly complex","Although this is quite a large book, I bought it with every intention of going from cover to cover. But for the C++ beginner I think it's easy to get lost in some of the examples. I think in a book like this the examples should be as plain and simple as possible and still illustrate the concept being discussed. Granted, to someone experienced in C++, the examples ARE very simple, but can still be confusing to a total beginner. When you start trying to do something useful in the examples, like calculate prime numbers or the amount of wallpaper a room needs, you add in an extra element that could confuse someone. For me the book is a nice reference to have around to look something up, but not something that, for me anyway, could bring me from a total beginner to writing useful programs on its own."
5,Nicely Put Together,"I recently finished a beginning C++ class where the textbook that was used was by Deitel and Deitel. From a beginner's perspective with some VB experience, the Deitel and Deitel book was more of a reference book than a learning guide which I wanted. I bought Ivor Horton's book and never opened the Deitel and Deitel book for the remainder of the class unless I needed to get some assignments from it. I finished with an A !"
1,Horrible,"I just hated this book.The author has this one example that he uses for 10 chapters.So if you suddenly wanna learn how to write a Dll you have to go back atleast 5 chapters and read everything.Besides what kind of an example is the draw line,circle and curve.The author should have used a more mature and useful example.I do not recommend it to anyone."
2,excessively complex,"The idea is great. The book covers a good amount of C++, and then moves on to MFC. The execution of the idea is terrible. It seems Mr. Horton spends more time showing off his abilities as a programmer then he does trying to explain the concepts. My teacher used this book in a college MFC programming class. I hardly ever touched this book, and was forced to use others for reference. Almost everything I learned about C++, I learned from lectures and other books, and everything I learned about MFC, I got from ""Practical Visual C++"", which manages to focus on MFC while teaching it instead of focusing on an excessive amount of trivial C++ code. If you want to get a good feel of C++, get ""Beginning Visual C++"" by Tony Gaddis. It covers more then the first half of Horton's book, and explains it well (unlike Horton). True, you might end up spending a bit more money then just by buying this book, but at least you'll have an idea of whats going on."
5,Excellent,"I would just like to say that ""Beginning Visual C++ 6"" by ""Ivor Horton"" is a thoroughly excellent book. Having bought several other titles on C++ (a waste of cash), none compare to the level and attention to detail that Ivor has put together in his book. I am a professional VB developer and trying to get a good handle on C++. Ivor's clear and detailed explanations of all aspects of C++ have made this task relatively simple. I have read many programming books over the years, but none have ever inspired me to reply with either a positive or negative feedback. My new skills in C++, are definitely attributable to this brilliant book."
4,Great beginning book,"This book has an abundance of in depth information that is presented very well. As always, prior experience in C++ and basic 'Windows Programming' would be extremely helpful. However, even if you have never written a program in your life this is still an excellent selection. Ivor Horton presents all of his material in an accurate and very comprehensive manner. The only drawback is that you may require yourself to review several, or all, sections multiple times to obtain an acceptable level of understanding for yourself. In several cases that I witnessed, a reader would read through all the material assuming that they would miraculously acquire a better understanding of the book the more they read. However in most cases they reached a point that they were lost because nearly every subject in the book requires knowledge on the previous subject to complete fully. An overall, excellent title."
3,"if you are absolutely new to programming, then get this book","I am a computer science student deciding to teach my self the language befor I take the class. As the books claims, beginning C++. And it serves its purpose well as a beginning tool to learning C++. However, after spending time reading this book, you will end up with a superficial understanding of the language. As such, your depth with reference to C++ will be lacking. You will have gained an understanding of the C++ syntax but not neccesarily the language and its concepts. For more rewarding and challenging books, I first suggest Dr. stroustrup 'The C++ programming language' and as a compliment 'C++ how to program' by the deitels. Warning! You will be challenged."
3,Not for totally new comer,"In chapter 5 , it is hardly understand the example given. Examples are, pointer and reference. Especially the try it out section of the returning a Reference. To read this book, I need to catch up in mathematics calculation parts and programming which will consume more time to read as my math is average level."
3,"Ivor, you've failed","I began programming with Ivor Horton's Beginning Java 2, JDK 1.3 Edition. It was excellent, full of pertinent information, well organized, informative... everything I could want. When I wanted to learn C++, I bought a book by the same guy. It was a big mistake.This book spends too much time on really simple concepts and does not sufficiently explain others. For example, enumeration types are lavishly explained in such a way that somebody could easily read the pages (that's more than one page about a special int... YIKES!) about them seven times without understanding that each is just an int with a named set of values. I also particularly dislike some bad formatting, unnecessary time spent on how to use an IDE, and the complete ignorance of the printf() function in favor of the less efficient cout stream."
1,He lost me after chapter 1,"Not a book for the beginner. I would try learning OOP first, then read a C tutorial on the net, then go to this book."
2,Not good as expected,This book spends a lot of space in introducing C++ fundamentals. I think this book is only good for dummy users and the ones who really don't know programming in C++. It doesn't suit the title of the book. The example in VC is not good at all and the explanation is not understandable. I think the VC part is in very poor quality.
2,New MFC classes are not even mentioned,"For a C++ programmer, who is new to Visual C++ 6, but not to C++, this book is quite useless. The new MFC classes, such as CMonthCalCtrl or CDateTimePicker, are not even mentioned in the book, so don't look for them. The dialog chapter (Chapter 17) seems to be recycled from previous versions of the book, with new screen shots inserted instead of the old ones, but the rest just covering basics that any C++ programmer doesn't need to be taught. I think a much better book is SAMS Teach Yourself Visual C++6 in 21 days. At least it has all classes and members functions indexed."
1,There are better books than this....,"You would think after several prints of this book being updated from previous versions, that they would gotten the code errors out of the print, no such luck. This book has more than the acceptable amount of errors. Don't believe me? Check out the errata site for it at Wrox.com. I would suggest a copy of ""C++ The Complete Reference"" and ""Inside Visual C++"". This combination benefited me a lot more than Ivor's book did."
3,First Half Excellent; Second Half Extremely Poor,"The first half of the book teaching you how to program in C++ is excellent. The explanation is clear and concise. The second half dealing with MFC, unfortunately, is very poor. He starts out by hammering you with the whole MFC document/view architecture. Sure, you can go thru the motion of using the AppWizard to generate a template program, but good luck trying to wade thru all the canned code and understand them. If you are someone who learn by layers and refuse to take things on faith, his introduction of MFC will definitely disappoint you."
2,Too much math!,"This book is accurate but uses too much numeric examples and not enough character examples. Puts you to sleep with all thise numeric examples. Starts off interesting for everyone to follow then talks to you like you were a veteran algebra person. If he conveyed messages with character examples rather than all numeric examples this book would be more easy to follow. I am one test away from an MCSD and the Visual Basic books I read were much more stimulating without all those numeric examples Ivor uses. Two stars for being accurate. How this book was rated best book buy amazon is beyond me. I have read 15 programming books in the last year, so I know what I am talking about!!!"
1,Wouldn't waste your money,"This is a lame attempt to publish a book that has little value when you are considering an in-law suite. Almost all of the ""useful tips"" are common sense, and reasons why most people are thinking about adding an in-law suite in the first place. I was very disappointed with this books' quality. There is little to this, and the floor plans aren't too creative, at best. Keep searching until you find a better source - I wouldn't waste more than a couple of bucks on a book of this quality."
5,brite light without wasting energy,It is really light(as in weight). The cord is heavier than the actual working light
1,"Bayco 26 Watt Work Light, poor quality","I received this item as a Christmas gift. It has some very nice features, two 13 watt florescent lamps that can be independently turned on and off. It also has a plug outlet in the handle. It runs much cooler than the incandescent 100 watt light that I have used for years.I hung it on my wall and in about an hour it stopped working. It was made in China, it's probably a quality problem. It's now in an USA landfill with it's mercury filled florescent lamps. I will be very wary of any product labeled with BAYCO or NASCAR."
2,Trouble Light Review,"Although I'm sure this is a good produce, it doesn't have a long enough cord to be useful.Unfortunately, I put it on the shelf, hoping for a time in the future when I can use it."
2,Failed after 2 or 3 years,"Just like another reviewer, I used this for 2 or 3 years with no problems, then recently I went to use it and it didn't work. Thinking somehow both bulbs had expired, I bought replacements bulbs, and it still didn't work. I took it apart and with a voltmeter determined the electronics inside failed somehow, unfixable by me. I think a work light should last much longer than 2 or 3 years, but that's the trouble with electronics everywhere, the gizmotronics fail long before the lamps or the rest of the product."
4,Work light,"This light is awesome! The cord is long enough to move around, the light is very bright and its easy to move."
3,piercing sound for small ears,"My two-year-old and I have a great time playing with this and other percussion instruments while listening to salsa and other music with a good beat. However, this wood block is very high-pitched and kind of hurts the ears if you play it full-out, correctly. The flip side is that it's rather difficult for a little kid to find the sweet spot on it--and get that full-out sound. I'm not sure there's a better option since its small size is both what causes the high-pitchedness and what makes it manageable for small hands! Bigger ones probably have a more mellow sound and a larger sweet spot, but will be too big for a toddler's hands."
3,music maker -- soft wood,This is a fun toy -- but the block is not really made of hard wood. My 19-month-old daughter made indentations all over the wood by hitting it with the mallet. Not of great quality -- but what can you expect for under $3.
2,You get what you pay for,"My wife had put together a wonderful presentation with the grandkids to perform for everyone when they came to our house for Christmas. A surprise to the parents and the secret was actually kept. The ages of the grandkids ranged from 6 to 11. The eldest was on the keyboard and the rest we bought percussion instruments for. This included a tambourine, triangle, sleigh bells and the wood block. We got better sound quality from beating on a 2 X 4. The block was not used and thrown away. At least it didn't cost very much."
2,Poor sound quality,This looked great in photo but the sound it makes is not. My child likes to carry around the mallet but has little interest in this block. Any other sound blocks I've tried had a wonderful sound. I was disappointed!
1,"3 stars average rating, really??","Just a terrible movie. Quite possibly the worst Uma Thurman has been involved in. Rating it on its own merits, it's not that bad of a movie-- just kind of silly and dumb and totally forgettable. Comparing it to the Peel-era shows is what makes this very hard to watch. First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg. Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel. Secondly, this is set in modern day. So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves. Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel. Sealing the tomb is a barrage of crappo CGI which makes the whole thing look like the graphics on a fast food cup set to motion. For a dumb film of a similar flavor which actually succeeds at being a comedy, just rent ""Austin Powers""."
2,Another Hopeless TV Retread,"No one was clamoring for a big-screen remake of the classic ""Avengers"" TV series, but Hollywood didn't listen and churned out this forgettable box-office fiasco. Despite its impressive visual style, the finished product made a good cast look terribly foolish. Ironically, the film's most positive aspect was introducing new viewers to the original exploits of John Steed and Emma Peel."
1,unforgivably bad,"How can you improve on perfection? The original series with Diana Rigg was one of the best ever. It was campy, perfectly synchronized with the oddities of 1960s design, worldview, and style, and told good, short stories. It was a wonderful world unto itself.By contrast, this film tries for camp without synching with the times, for an old-fashioned chemistry that it traduces (Emma and Steed had wonderful sexual tension, but everything else was implied, never shown), and for a weird yet believable story. But it fails utterly.This film is so bad that it is like making a comic book version of a comic book. Not only do Fiennis and THurman utterly lack chemistry, in spite of their great talent, but the plot is simply and stupidly unbelievable. I think that this is the worst tv-remake I have ever seen. That answers the question: you shouldn't try to exploit perfection by slapping together a stupid film.Not recommended. THere are far better things to waste one's time on."
2,Forgettable,"As a big fan of the original TV series (I saw them all in reruns), I was extremely disappointed by this movie. Fiennes and Thurman are fine actors individually, but together in the roles of John Steed and Emma Peel they lacked any chemistry whatsoever. They just didn't capture the flirtatious, twinkle-in-eye relationship of Steed and Emma. The plot was forgettable and rumor has it, Connery, who played the villain, didn't want the movie to be released once he saw how it bad came out. If you're the curious type, and I was, you'll sit through Avengers The Movie, but don't have high expectations."
5,A great Saturday Afternoon Movie,"My friend & I thoroughly enjoyed this lighthearted and surrealistic romp through a retro/futuristic London. You don't need to have lock-on concentration to keep up with the plot, it's beautiful to look at, and often so weird and wonderful. It's great to see filmmakers being a little silly again - we surely don't always need to be ponderous and intense!"
2,Missing Something,"Connery was good. Thurman was good. Fiennes was good. The supporting cast was fair-to-middling. The teddy bear scene was a trip. But the film was lacking a certain carefree quality. It seemed to take its subject matter too seriously and at the same time not give the audience enough time to emerse itself in the world of the film. Overall, a flop."
2,"I wonder when the ""Hawaii Five-O"" movie's coming out.","Why does Hollywood waste its budget on movies based on 50's, 60's, or 70's TV shows? Can't anybody think for themselves anymore? Films like these give good actors bad reputations, and Ralph Fiennes, Sean Connery, and Uma Thurman are great actors. The three of them must've been trying to hang themselves after the theater release."
4,"VERY CLEVER, SHOWS WONDERFUL BRITISH WIT","Me being british and living in london i really liked this film, i think it was misunderstood in america. I dont think people got the humor or the cleverness of the story. It was however very very popular in london, if people werent so in to horror and sex films they would enjoy this one!!! i give it 4 stars!!!"
5,One of the best Uma Thurman movies ever!,"I love this movie so much I had to review it again. Ralph Finess is John Steed. A british spy agent. Uma thurman is Emma Peel, John steed's partner and minor love interest. Sean Connery is Sir August Dewinter. He is the main villan that is controling british weather. Uma thurman did an outstanding performance as Emma Peel. She is very charming and sophisticated in this film. She can fight Sir August Dewinter's henchman without a scratch. She can also play the piano very well. Uma thurman was very good in this movie."
3,"Oh come now, it's not THAT bad!","Honestly, to the people who were expecting a Shakespearean masterwork, lighten up! This film was not designed to be a truly thoughtful piece of social comentary. . .it was meant to be strictly an entertaining hour and a half, which it was. Sure there were plot holes, and strange characters, and some other things I didn't quite understand. . .but it succeeded quite well stylistically and technically. If you want serious drama, rent something else, please. (P.S. The film is quite worth the rental price just to see Ralph Fiennes in some lovely suits. Sigh. . .)"
1,This is not worth your time,"Dumb, boring, stupid plot....You name it, you got it!Go see Pink Panther instead."
2,Nice Visuals,"Sadly, ""The Avengers"" is one of the only films I've ever walked out on in the theater, but upon re-watching a fresh copy of the finally-released video I just purchased, I find that the movie has it's good points. Sure, the script is abysmal and really makes no sense whatsoever, but Ralph Fiennes certainly looks very good and Uma was never costumed better. The special effects are really interesting and kind of fun to look at. However, I can only recommend this one if you're a huge fan of Mr. Fiennes, Mr. Connery, or Ms. Thurman, and don't mind watching videos with the mute button on."
2,"movie o.k., but doesn't doe series justice","when hereing about this movie i hurried up to watch origanal series epispodes first. Bad idea! You might like this movie only if you have not seen the series. Thurman played horrible version of MRS. Peel, also neither fiennes or thurman captured the origanl personality traits of Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg. The movie hints towards romance which the series barely even hinted at. recomend only to new avenger watchers, and warn away avid avenger series lovers."
2,What happened?,"This movie goes down as one of the biggest lost oppertunites in the history of film. Ralph Finnes and Uma Thurman and Sean Connery all camping it up, great style, british accents, cool special effects, what could go wrong? Well... ever seen pictures of the hindenburg? The film gets an added star just because there were some sequences that worked, but it's an awful film. And I don't mean awful as in, a great awful movie like 'Batman and Robin' or 'Jack Frost'. Avengers is deathly dull. I mean, they even made Sean Connery boring!! What a waste."
1,I'll give a negative grade if I can,"I can't believe a movie with such a big budget and three big stars could be this bad. I think I'm very easy to be pleased, even Lost in space is not very bad to me. At least Lost in space has some not very bad special effects. The avengers doesn't have anything interesting inside. Not even special effect.(so shitty) I tried three times to finish a 90 mins movie and I was bored to death. I guess the CEO of WB should resign. Look what he did, Lost in space, postman, and this which must be the worst.Sorry ralph fiennes, but why you took this stupid role. I hope this won't ruin your career"
1,A movie (and DVD) horrific in its badness -- save your money,"I knew the movie got bad reviews, but thought I'd buy it anyway, since I love the British spy genre in general (Bond, et al) and figured it couldn't be THAT bad... Well, I was wrong!! Save your money! Poor Sean Connery's worst choice of a film since Highlander 2: The Quickening. Uma Thurman is still a goddess but she AIN'T English and she AIN'T Emma Peel, and Ralph Fiennes is totally miscast. It amazes me that Hollywood could mess up a nearly foolproof concept like an Avengers movie, and furthermore that the studio moguls were willing to bankroll the idiots who wrote, casted, and directed this one. Ugh. I can't say it enough -- don't waste your money as I did..."
2,What a waste!,"One of the biggest disappointments of all time! What a waste of such a fabulous cast! Who dreamed up the plot anyway, the directors 5 year old nephew? The scene in which a group of criminals disguise themselves in fuzzy pastel colored bear suits has to be one of the silliest moments ever put on film. I give it two stars for the scene where Emma gets lost in the staircase."
1,"They blew this one from the word ""Go""","With this cast and the source to work from this should have been great , but alas the shot themselves in the foot with this bomb. Next to ""Wild,Wild, West"" as the worst T.V. show to movie ever made!!!!!!!!"
1,The worst major film of all time?,"""The Avengers"" may be the most dreadful film ever released by a major studio. A laughable plotline, an infantile screenpaly, an embarrassing script...this movie has it all. If you did not see it in the theaters, by all means rent it (DON'T buy it, for heaven's sake). Everyone who enjoys movies needs to see this incredible barker. It makes the second half of ""Barton Fink"" seem like best picture material."
1,I don't get it.,"I agree with those who commented that this isn't one of those movies that's so bad you have to laugh at it--it's worse. I do remember moaning ""kill me"" once or twice after about 20 minutes of trying to figure out why this movie was ever made. I also remember the intermission, where I was torn between going to McDonald's before they closed and staying to see if the second half was any better. One minute later I was eating a burger and drinking coffee."
1,I NEVER FELT SO JACKED,"As regretful to say I saw this movie in theater with my mother. Once I saw the meeting with people dressed as teddy bears, I was like, ""Mama, I'm sorry I'm going to play some video games in the lobby."" I tried to watch it, but it just got sadder by the second. The only time I came back was when I asked my mother for more quarters.Come 15 minutes after I left, my Mama even came out telling me ""Kim lets go it's hopeless."" Everybody was so caught up in the hype about how they made the special effects look, and I for one was taken for a fool. I Dought I would EVER find a movie worse then this. For the people who want to rent this PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF OR YOUR FAMILY!"
1,It's a WASTE OF TIME!!!,"This might be the worst thing I've ever watched in my life! This movie isn't worth watching. I don't know why I feel it's a try to make something like Batman & Robin!!! Well, Batman & Robin was good, but this is really bad! It's a shame that Sean Connery and Uma Thurman were in such a bad movie. Hey, isn't that a little surprise that Uma was in Batman & Robin too?!! The 1 star I gave to this movie is the lowest option available, but honestly I would give it a big 0."
1,Some times it works sometimes we get The Avengers,"In the hit or miss business called ""show"" and the utter lack of ideas that are being pitched to movie studios lately it was only a matter of time till ""they"" got their ""greedy little hands"" on a terrific classic TV show ""The Avengers"" John Steed and Emma Peel, clever scripts, plus the unrequited sexual tension between the two characters, a gem. Ralph Finnes is so blah I wonder why he's a movie star at all."
1,Awful,So bad. Watch the 60's TV episodes as they have come out on VHS and DVD but don't touch this with a 10ft pole.
1,Brain starving...please feed brain...movie killing brain...,"Me director. Make movie. Movie have people, cars, costumes, and costumes. And costumes. Here plot--plot very good! It have bad guy...and good guy! Geniyus stuff plot. And talking stuff wrote good too, real movie sounded stuff. Listen, and you no throw up like some watchers...Sean Connery in plot. In costume. He talk. You no throw up when he talk. In costume. When Ralph and Uma talk, sorry, you throw up. On costumes. And somebody die! So watch and see who die. In costume. Me director--say, watch! Me make good film, you like and not throw up much. But when Ralph and Uma talk, have wastebasket ready, sorry."
1,Warner's greatest error,"The worst movie in the history of the Warner Brothers. Awfull, just Sean Connery and Uma Thurman makes it a movie, if not it would have been a bad joke."
1,Beyond awful. It must be deliberate...,"Whether you've seen the original series or not, anyone with half a brain can see that this film is terrible from start to finish. The script is lame, Fiennes and Thurman sleepwalk through their roles with no feeling, the special effects are totally unnecessary (did they blow up Big Ben just so the Americans would think it was all so quaintly British?) and the direction was unimaginative. The plot idea was quirky and off-the-wall, but the way it was told was just so stupid it went from amusingly silly to boringly stupid very quickly. A must-see for all those insomniacs out there."
1,Absolutely Horrendous,"This movie is the one of the top ten worst films I have ever seen. The story makes no sense whatsoever, the characters are very wooden (all three of them), and most of the effects were thrown in to waste money (flying mechanical bees? give me a break). This movie was a waste of $60 million dollars to the studio that made it, and it will be a waste of 2 hours of your life if you make the mistake of buying it. Please, for the love of God, avoid this movie at all costs!"
1,A very disappointed Avengers fan.,"I am an avid ""Avengers"" fan, from the first B&W TV series with Honor Blackman to the ""New Avengers"" series with Joanna Lumely I saw in the UK. This movie was a major disappointment. Wait for cable before investing in this movie. Uma Thurmon beautiful as usual, and Sean Connery seemed ready to laugh in some segments. I do NOT recommend this movie."
1,God....why have you forsaken us???,"I never saw the original, and maybe that is a good thing, cause then I might have actually expected something...Uma (hiyakaramba) was on the cover... so I bought it....and till this day, it's hidden under the fridge...come on...what if me friends find out...I would rather stick my finger through my eye and scratch my brain for 85 min"
1,Unbelievably bad action movie!,"As a huge fan of the original series, I was very much looking forward to viewing this movie. Alas I have never been more disappointed when watching a film. Compared to the series, the portrayal of the characters was dire, (especially Ralph Finnes as Steed)and the script was lacklustere and tedious. The only scene which gains some merit is the scene with the electronic bees, but this cannot compensate for the apalling drivel in the rest of the movie. Altogether, a great shame."
1,THE WORST MOVIE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN>TERRIBLE!!,"The original series was great. However this movie didn't live up to the original. I have told several people if they happened to be at a local dump and they spotted a copy of this movie still sealed in the original wrapper just leave it there. This movie isn't worth the effort it would take to pick it up, unless you have a dog who loves to dig holes and bury things. I apologize, this movie deserves a -5 stars."
1,Not even close,"Even though we approached this movie with the attitude that it had the same title and characters as a series that we enjoyed, but that it would most likely be different from the series, we were seriously disappointed. The movie stinks. 'Steed' is not comfortable with his umbrella or his bowler hat, and 'Mrs. Peel' is channelling 'poison ivy' from the Batman film. The plot is threadbare, the acting is woeful. Even Sean Connery fails to save this movie.Rent it if you have to watch it, it's not worth buying. Better yet, buy one of the box sets of the original series. Even on her worst days, Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel is far sexier and wittier than Uma Thurman's attempt, and Patrick Macnee's wit and dry humour has to be seen to be believed."
3,Faithful in spirit,"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in 1966, I was in the 6th grade and discovered Steed and Emma on TV, and I adored them. So when this film was released, I never expected it to ""live up to"" the originals. But I was surprised at how faithful it was to the tone and wackiness of the old series. I may be in the minority in thinking this, but I believe ""The Avengers"" was brought lovingly to the screen. And although it ain't the ""real thing,"" it deserves kudos for being a noble, and even entertaining, effort."
1,Disappointing,"Totally anticipated, sadly disappointing. I don't think the director had a clue what makes the Avengers tick. It started out flat, the timing was off, and the movie was over before any chemistry ever hit the screen. As they say, all flash, no substance."
1,Incredibly Bad Movie,"I am a big Uma Thurman fan, and a big Sean Connery fan. You'd think this movie couldn't miss but you would be WAY wrong. I watched it and couldn't even tell for sure what the plot was. This will not be in my library. Amazing."
1,This One Really Sucks !,"EASILY THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR, EVEN THE TOP STARS CANT SAVE THIS ONE FROM BEING A DISASTER. I WOULD SAY DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR PASS THIS ONE FOR HISTORY. I ONLY WISH IF THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FREE RENTALS."
1,"notice, not even Patrick McNee would show his face!","I used to love the avengers series as a kid but could not believe this video. Thurman was still with none of the style or appeal of Diana Rigg. Fiennes had no savy at all - way too stiff. And what was with the sauna scene or the scenes when they kept taking one another to thier apartments. The relationship between McNee and Rigg probably gave way to classic TV relationships like Sam & Diane on cheers and others. No innuendo and no need for it. What about Sean Connery? Does this guy need the money? Nice bear suit but I would have left the head on so my face wouldn't have been show. No wit, no savy, just nothing. Even Patrick McNee played the invisible man. Not much fun!"
1,the word of the day is PAINFUL!!,"I concur with the previous review, this was just horrid. Perhaps my expectations of a thrilling remake of a favorite childhood show were too high. The writers, producers, and directors should all be flogged.The storyline held no suspence of disbelief because it was hard to care about the characters let alone any predicaments they may have gotten themselves into. The premise was completely unbelievable. One would have to assume the major stars of this dog owed someone a huge favor or were threatened in order to cast them.Please, leave this movie in a warehouse somewhere. Do not encourage Hollywood to make Avengers II."
4,The best of Uma Thurman,"Since I had not seen the original series, I was not expecting anything for the actors. What I got however, was a very enjoyful movie. I though it was highly entertaining, and recommended it. I think Uma Thurman finnally broke out of her seductive roles into a more natural and appealing one. If you are not to shallow when you start watching this movie, then you should enjoy it also."
3,Beautiful!!! But still goofy...,"I loved the way this movie was filmed. It was very beautiful and any frame would have made lovely pictures. They found the exact right actors to portray the characters, I thought (having never seen the original show). But the storyline was absolutely silly, although it was easy to follow. If you want a pretty movie, get it. If you want some kind of content and situations that reflect some kind of real life, get something else."
3,LIghten up; it's camp,"I bought this DVD for my finacee, who is a big fan of the original series. For some reason which might baffle anyone else who's seen the movie, we didn't mind it one bit.Sure, it's a campy movie, but that's why it's as good as it is. What a flaky TV show that was....but it was funny stuff watching these ultra-brits sipping tea and getting into awfully-choreographed fights with underground secret-society denizens and all-powerful billionaires with unbelievable motives (pant, pant).My point is, if you liked the show, you'll probably like the movie. Fun, mindless drivel! Good SFX, and kudos the the actors dedicated portrayal of John Steed and Emma Peel. Connery was great (he wears the kilt!), but should have showed up more."
2,"Entertaining , but a little lacking in substance","I thought the movie brought back a sense of 60's charm of the original avengers series. (If you have never seen the series you will think this movie is the biggest flop ever.) I think the director should have spent less money on special effects (especially the flying bug scene ?) Sometimes I think when making movies they think the namebrand actors like Connery , Thurman and Fiennes will just satisfy the audience, well this movie proves that wrong. It is very entertaining to see Connery in different roles rather than 007 and Fiennes in a different role than a SS officer. But, they still don't satisfy this movie watchers expectations. Nice try but this movie won't be a cult classic like it could have been."
1,Worst movie of the decade!,"As the late Thurston Howell III said on a Gilligans Island episode... ""I would have walked out on this on an airplane"". Even that would have been too kind for this movie. What was Sean Connery thinking when he accepted this role. A producer probably had some dirt on him. It least I hope so. I went to see it only because I trusted his judgement on quality. I will not make the same mistake again. Only buy it if you want to give it to enemy for a birthday present."
1,I wonder how...,"from a succesfull TV-Series and with actors like Connery, Thurman and Fiennes, they come out with this??? The Script is bad, but the editing even worse. There's nothing going for this movie, even the acting looked bad, the Director didn't have a clue of what he was doing. Don't watch this movie even if you have time to waste, is just not worth it."
1,Sad excuse for a film,This version of the Avengers doesn't even come close to doing justice to the original series. It is an absolute disgrace. The original series was full of fresh ideas and good writing. The movie is one of the worst remakes of a TV series that I have ever seen.
1,Oh Dear!,"I grew up in England, hence I tend to feel more affinity with UK based films in general. However, that doesn't save this film from extreme mediocrity. Even the worst 'Tough LA cop fighting the drug cartel' film has more going for it than this.This film dissapoints in almost all areas. The plot is far fetched and weak. Half the film is set in the 1960s, the other half in the 1990s, and the two halves do not marry well together. The special effects are mediocre. The film even drags down two excellent performers (Sean Connery, Uma Thurmann)who are given so little latitude that they can do nothing to salvage the situation. Overall, the impression is of a very second rate James Bond type movie, with cliches galore.I'm sorry Amazon, this review isn't going to sell you many copies of this DVD. The only people who would find this very interesting are young producers finding out how not to make an action movie. For me, I'll open another beer and stick to those LA cops."
1,Should be ZERO stars,"Ah, yes, another classic example of why NOT to make movies out of tv shows. Hollywood spends zillions to make bombs like this, as well as Mod Squad, Leave It To Beaver, Beverly Hillbillies, etc. Can't anyone write a story using their own imagination instead of raiding the vaults of golden television shows from the 50s-80s?! Of course not, no one has an original thought anymore, so just rip-off from favorite old shows & so what if they're not box-office winners, SOMEBODY out there will pay their good old hard earned money to see it."
1,One for the record books...,"You know how some movies are so badly done that they're actually funny in their awfulness... well, this is NOT one of them - it's much worse than that - it's TRULY worthless. It has NO redeeming features. Don't buy it! Don't rent it! Instead, spend your money on copies of the old Avenger series starring Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg. You'll find genuine campy humour, British style, and the wonderful, sexy interaction between Steed and Peel that made the original show so inimitable. I'll take one of Rigg's tantalizing smiles over a rear view of Thurman in a leather cat suit, any day."
1,Not nearly as good as the original series,"This movie is a waste of time. I don't know how you can take an entertaining television show such as The Avengers ans make it boring, but the producers of this film did. Where the original was a little quirky, this was just stupid.Ralph Fiennes was accepatable as John Steed, but Uma Thurman is not English, and does a horible job as an English spy. I have an orginal idea, if the character is suppossed to be British, why not hire a British actor?"
4,Fun and action filled,"This is a very watchable action flick, with Uma Thurman doing what she does best - wearing something tight and kicking the bad guys around. Sean Connery goes over the top as the mad Scottish scientist holding the world ransom. Mostly, though, it's comedy of manners. Steed and Dr. Peel (that's Thurman, but her friends can call her Mrs. Peel) maintain a relaxed tea-time manner no matter what the chaos around them or between them.I can't compare this to the original series, which aired more than 35 year ago. I suspect that fans will find this wanting. So be it. If you can take this for itself, you'll find a decent piece of humorous action entertainment.//wiredweird"
1,To What Purpose?,"An incredible sum of money was spent on the set design and special effects of a movie that no one wanted to see. ""The Avengers"", for Pete's sake? Does anyone care about that show? Is there anyone old enough to remember it? As for the movie itself, we are asked to suspend all, and I mean ALL, belief: a madman who can control the earth's weather is our plot device. Sheesh! Imagine ""Austin Powers"" without the intermittent humor. This film is utterly without life. Everyone involved should be busy trying to forget that they had anything to do with this picture."
5,"Great movie, I really enjoyed it !!!","It's the type of movie, you can watchrepeatedly, and enjoy it every time.I am happy to have it in my dvd collection!"
1,APPALLINGLY BAD,"This movie is bad in a way any movie a right to be.It's hard to convey to somebody how terrible this movie is. I'll just say this -- it's questionable whether this is a movie. There's a plot in the sense that the scenes are connected with some kind of logic. Zilcho story. The acting is about as good as those times when you read out dialogue in high school English classes.This is really an abomination which words find it hard to possibly convey to the reviewer. Some movies are so bad that they're funny in an awful sort of way. The Avengers is worse. Easily the worst big-budget ""film"" EVER."
4,"witty, stylish, and fun","I don't know what all the fuss is about. This is a fun and stylish homage to the great TV series of the 60's.I can't imagine any harder task than to try to compete with Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, and face the inevitable comparisons. No mean task, to be sure, and a brave one. But Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman are wonderful. Of course, there are many parallels in their characterizations, but they still manage to create their own style and chemistry. With the back-up of great supporting actors and a witty, caustic script, they make the characters and story their own.Jim Broadbent is brilliant as Mother. The sets are superb. The CGI is well done, and not phony-looking. Sean Connery is devilish. The story is clever.I am only sorry to that hear the producers, in response to so much negativity, cut the film a great deal. It is edited beautifully, but I would love to see it as originally designed."
3,Poor Plot but Stylish nonetheless,"I never saw the orginal Avengers series, but judging by the reviews, I think I ought to. I love Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes which is why I bought the movie, and they did a heck of job styling up their characters in post-60s mod. But The plot was completely crap and disjointed. Someone on the editting floor was not paying attention to what they were doing.Nonetheless, entertaining enough to pass a boring day."
4,Better than some people would like it to be,"There seems to be a lot of argument over how good is this film. Some people love it, some loath it. Actually, it's somewhere in the middle. I liked it, and found it entertaining. There are some movies I lose interest in halfway through. I didn't lose interest here. There are some films that are so sappy or preachy I turn them off. This isn't one of them. It's a decent film, if you don't take it too seriously. The film may be a bit disjointed, and not entirely believable at times, but it isn't boring. Most films are not entirely believable, as far as that goes. So, as long as you're not expecting too much, and are willing to suspend your disbelief (which most films require - come on, Castaway?) This can be an enjoyable film."
2,Good to Watch When You're Housecleaning,"This movie is not as bad as people say, but it's by no means any good either. It's the perfect video to watch when you're cleaning the house, because you can simply watch a scene here, a scene there, and not worry about missing scenes or missing out on the plot, because there is none. The sets are pretty, and Uma Thurman looks nice. There are some goofy situations. That's about it. If you want to watch a movie clean through, and be satisfied, this is not it."
1,Disappointment for fans of Feinnes ...,"I saw this movie because I think Ralph Fiennes is a fabulous actor. But what was he thinking appearing in this stupid, cheesy flick? The actors sounded like high school drama students running lines -- there was no emotion. The plot was ridiculous. I haven't seen the original TV series, so maybe the movie was true to its style. And I know there are a lot of people who like incredibly silly movies like this (my dad, for instance), but for fans of Fiennes other films this will surely be a disappointment."
2,Not that good,This movie had good affects but the plot was horrible I could have thought of something better than that and I'm 15 years old.
1,Boring,I knew it had gotten bad reviews but I thought I'd give it a go. The script was flat and the acting wasn't very good. I kept seeing Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes instead of Emma Peel and John Steed. Actually. I fell asleep twice during the movie.
1,Please tell me when to lough.,"I guess it was supposed to be a comedy. Well my 4 year old nephew has a better sence of humor. This movie is so dumb. Eventually, you will start laughing at the creators of this ""masterpiece""."
1,The *yawn* Avengers movie,"Ho-hum!!! What good can be said about this movie except that it takes the mantle of ""Most Wretched Action Movie"" away from ""Batman Forever"". No chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman, both are great actors, but horribly miscast. Even poor Mr. Connery looks weary of it all. Plotting is tepid --I dozed through the middle of it-- and the only good part is Uma in that leather catsuit *mrrrrroooww!!!!*Look, save your money and just buy any of the boxed sets of the original series. They rock! And Ms. Rigg looks better in her catsuit anyway!!!"
3,Is equal to both the good and bad episodes,"I don't know how a lot of poeple can bad mouth the Avengers movie. In my opinion a lot of adults were using to much Nostalgia before going into this film, and that is why when they came out they were dissapointed. While actually compared against other episodes of the Avengers this movie is quite equal in comparrison to the shows natural quirkiness."
1,Worst movie in the past 20 years,"This quite possibly could be the worst movie made in the past 20 years. The story was almost completely unfollowable, the stunts and effects were silly, and for the life of me I still don't get the giant teddy bears. Fiennes and Thurman have absolutley no chemistry together, and when they attempt to have a witty conversation, they come off as petulant children (I'm wittier than you - no I'm wittier, etc.). Do yourelf a favor and avoid buying this at all costs. If you still have an insane urge to see it, try to catch it on late night cable."
1,God Awful,"I love movies and I'll sit through almost anything. I almost walked out on this one, but I stuck it through to the end. What a mistake! Bad script, bad acting.... Trust me, save your money."
1,Worst film I've ever seen,"I knew I had to see it as I am a fan of the TV series. It's almost as if the writers watched a few old episodes, picked up a few ideas and threw them into the script. Absolutely NOTHING worked, the daft things Steed did (like the tea making in the car) worked in the TV show because it was done with style; in the film it came over as pathetic. Uma Thurman is no Diana Rigg; she can't act and was totally inept."
3,Have a plot next time,"i enjoyed the visuals (Steed and Peel's apparel, the set, the atmosphere), and thought they nailed the quirky Steed/Peel dialogue, but, GOOD LORD, the story was awful. Even when you knew why people were doing thins you didn't care. A fake Mrs. peel, men in teddy bear costumes, weather blackmail, but who cared."
2,Beautiful to watch,"Terrible movie, to be sure, but the art direction and special effects are pretty terrific. And, although they're not given much to work with, Fiennes and Thurman give decent performances. Frankly, it's no better or worse than any of the Batman films."
4,The Avengers: Not as bad as you think....,"Just a short review of The Avengers! What everyone has been saying about it being such a bad film is twaddle! It's a neat wee film with some great Special FX and performances (esp. by Eileen Aitkens!). The downside is the script and the failure of the two leads, Thurman and Fiennes to capture the original feeling of the Macnee/Rigg era. Another problem is that it seems to be a series of set pieces rather than an entire movie. BUT beautifully directed, stunningly photographed and the sets rae out of this world!"
1,If only they had a 0 star rating!,"THE AVENGERS is, hands down, one of the worst films that I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few bad ones). I went to see it in the theatres with modest expectations, and proceeded to enjoy exactly 3 minutes of it (the cool opening titles). After that, I sat in astonished silence watching this obviously grossly expensive piece of trash. The fact that one of history's most dignified actors, Sean Connery, manages to give his single bad performance to date, is only one of the negatives on display here. THE AVENGERS occupies that strange void where it's badness can't even be laughed at. This movie is pure trash, and there are very few movies that I heatedly dislike. If you're reading this review and actually plan on buying this movie, I recommend you save your money. I'll never understand how such talented actors and such a large budget can create such disposable junk. Avoid this movie at all costs. Consider yourself warned."
1,Would have made a better painting...,"What a waste of time.. a caricature of the cariacture of ""Englishness"" that made the originals so watchable.. how can anything so obviously contrived have hoped to have worked? if you went to an English public school it works on a very surreal level, but it's hardly worth the time. The English are quite capable of sending themselves up: I suggest next time that the producers leave us to it.."
4,If you like watching BBC this is for you,"I got this to replace an old vhs copy, love it! Sometimes the oldies really are the ones to watch!"
3,Was expecting much more.,Guess I just liked the tv series too much. The movie isn't that bad I just kept comparing it to memories.
1,I expected more.,"I like British stuff. I like spies...but this movie kept putting me to sleep; however, there was this one bit where they were driving a convertible and pressed a button on the dash and hot tea came out of the tap. They drank it from actual cups and saucers while going down the road. When the credits started rolling, I realized that Voldemort had been in it...Ralph Fiennes as John Steed. Sean Connery was also in it. I do like his voice."
1,OMG - What a waste of time,I am embarrassed to say I watched 35 minutes of this ghastly movie hoping that it would get better. Save yourself...do NOT bother with this mess.
2,Therapeutic,This has got to be one of the worse movies ever. Especially since the elements to make an interesting movie were already there. Story. Characters. They even had decent actors. The dialogue was terrible.But there is something strangely benign about it. It doesn't make you angry. It lulls you. To sleep. Sometimes that's not a bad thing.I have several movies I put on that put me right to sleep. This is one of them. Maybe it's the low droning sound that is the characters speaking. Worth the $3 used I think I paid.Fargo puts me to sleep too. Something about the snow.
1,Film lover's revenge!,"Dear God! Did this movie suck ass! Even Sean Connery's entire coolness couldn't save it! Unlike Highlander 2, his scenes were some of the worst! If you can get thru the ""Teddy Bear"" scene, you are a better man than I!"
3,Low-key fluff,"The 60s' Brit TV show was never one of my faves. It was a low-budget James Bond spoof, which Bond itself was as a spoof of Cold War spies in general,, though not low-budget. Here, despite three big name stars, the film never quite takes off, seeming instead like nothing so much as a, well, high-budget TV show. In the 60s, the sexual tension between agent John Steed and Mrs. Peel was highly suggestive stuff. Today, it seems quaint, almost literary. Never mind the plot here. It's a mishmash of more Bond crossed with Lord of the Rings special effects. Some mumbojumbo about a megalomaniac controlling the weather. The whole point of this movie is archness. Sometimes it works and often it's just tedium. Watch if there is nothing else."
1,Maybe the 2012 will fare better?!?,"Even though ten years older than myself, it is clear that director Jeremiah Chechik didn't have a clue as to what made the TV version a draw (Diana Rigg). If you don't cast a Diana Rigg then forget doing a remake. When Val Kilmer took on the role of ""The Saint"" it was casting agent Elisabeth Leustig and director Phillip Noyce (Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games) that had the right stuff to revive a British staple of 60's television. It should have been Noyce directing ""The Avengers-1998"" as well, coupled with another incredible music score of Graeme Revell. I've no doubt it would have been DY-NO-MITE! But it wasn't....not even close. Keep your fingers crossed for the 2012 version."
3,Nowhere Near As Bad As People Say,"Sean Connery. Ralph Fiennes. Jim Broadbent. Patrick Macnee. Uma Thurman in a black castsuit. The Avengers. All these elements, mixed together, should equal a summer smash hit. With Patrick Macnee moved to a voice-over, and the style of 'The Avengers' not quite translated onto celluloid properly, the film suffers - but only a bit.Why critics smacked this film is beyond understanding. It homages several episodes from the original series - where Mrs Peel is trapped on the never-ending staircase, and the whole 'controlling the weather' plot - and maintains the series' level of absurdity without going over the top. Sean Connery in a teddy bear suit? It could have come from an Emma Peel episode.And yet Ralph Fiennes is a let down. He has no chemistry with Uma Thurman. He tries admirably, but you simply cannot beat Patrick Macnee."
2,directors cut-you're needed,"i think it is almost common knowledge by now that this movie was cut to shreds after poor test screenings. A very good opening sequence was cut along with ""backstory"" scenes that would have ensured that the film made sense. Therefore this version has curiosity value because it shows exactly what happens to a film when a studio panics and decides that a film will exactly fit 90 minutes regardless of how it will affect the story. The directors cut is in the vaults and should be released on DVD now if only to show the fans what the original story was intended to be."
3,"Better than critics said, worse than fans expected","Though this movie clearly failed to live up to the expectation of many of the old series' fans, it was certainly not as bad as reviewed. Ralph Fiennes, for example, played a terrific Steed. Thurman wasn't all that great, but I didn't go to the movie to see her. The action sequences were exciting, and the gadgetry was adequate. My only complaint is that the movie was too short--ultimately failing to deliver an effective knock-out punch at the end. However, for all dvdofiles, this movie is worth owning."
1,Don't See This Film,"I was too young to see ""The Avengers"" when it was showing in the late 60's, and I don't think it would have changed the way I would have felt about this movie. All the way home in my car I was running my fingers through my Rosary Beads praying that this great blight on the careers of Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, and Sean Connery would not harm the public perception of their talent, not to mention their ability to intelligently choose a marketable film. This film, undoubtedly the worst released in 1998, is plotless, thoughtless, witless, artless, not to mention just plain dumb. Not even the very talented cast assembled can salvage even one moment of artistic accomplishment in what on paper might have looked like a good idea but but on screen was a big-budget embarrassment. Poor Ralph."
2,Don't watch alone...you'll want company for this one!,"This movie is either directed at the very young or the very young at heart: it's silly. And unfortunately, the plot neither stayed true to the series nor stood on its own very well. The dialogue was the biggest problem. It seemed like the cast actually spit out some of their lines like, ""I can't believe you're making me say this!"" Even still, it did have cult appeal: a few humorous lines and numerous cool special effects. (And wow, who picked out those clothes for Uma...could she have looked any better?) If you like silly, or can tolerate it, it's worth watching with a fun group of friends--and maybe a few good drinks."
1,One of the Worst Movies of the year!,"Don't bother wasting your money on this horribly-plotted, bad story film. The actors are fine, but the story is not smooth. It is very choppy in some parts that they don't make sense and there are unanswered questions in the film! Heck, I could have made a better story for the Avengers series."
1,"If you must watch it, turn the sound down","There are some interesting visuals in this painfully bad mess of a film (in particular a scene where the lead characters step out of giant bubbles, for no apparent reason), but that's all the good that's here. Every other aspect is dreadful. The only way to watch this horrendous flop is to turn the sound down & listen to some music you like. Don't put yourself through the torture of listening to the dialogue."
3,Hope you're lucky.,"The description (regarding the screen) said ""scuffled, wouldn't say scratched""; but in fact it was quite scratched--admittedly, no major ones and, for the most part, not a distraction during play. It'd be fine if that was all, but shortly after use the D-Pad and analog stick have been acting up. Anyway, it's up to your luck about the condition of the PSP you get. But it works and, if you know what you're doing, it's generally worth the price."
4,Very nice Unit!,"I received the unit which was in great condition, but it was completely dead. I purchased a charger for it and now it is up and running. The only problem is, I don't have an instruction book for it. I have no idea how to get the games going on it."
3,Psp phat 1000 black used,"I'm not sure which one this is but I had bought 2 used psps both said to be in very good condition and they both looked more average. One had the joy stick missing and did really mention it at all and the other moved a certian way without pushing the button but beside that it came in 3+ days before it was suposed to, both were packed nice and really were ok overall good deals I bought them for my sons first handheld video games. And I can always buy a joystick for a good price here on Amazon!"
4,A favorite oldie,Bought this for my son to enjoy an old classic Phil Keaggy album. The guitar work and lyrics are both great.
2,shabby,"I love this album, was one of the first cassetes that I ever owned, I got as a gift, the cd was missin a few tracks that I remember havin on the cassete and the packageing sucked, sorry for the negative response."
5,23+ years of listening bliss (just ask my sons)!,"I wore out the vinyl and my parents' eardrums when this LP came out in 1981. Who could have predicted that, years later, my sons (the oldest of whom is the age I was when ""Whip It"" came out!) & I would be singing along together as the CD blared from my BMW's speakers? (They even think their old mom has great taste in music.) ""Mecha Mania Boy"" makes the special edition worth the extra dough, but that doesn't mean you can get away with not buying ""Duty."""
5,"5 Stars for the Music, ZERO STARS for the CRAPPY MASTERING","Some people love this album, some people don't. This was my first Devo album, and I love it. ENough said. I bought this edition - ""Collectables"" label - as I incorrectly believed that by 2005 they'd be able to remaster an album such as this that would yield better sound quality than any of the older CD editions you'd find here, some of them as double albums.... Well I was wrong. The CD sounds as if was mastered from an 8-track tape as it sounds awful! I sure hope Rhino or some other label would give this album the respect it deserves and remaster it from the original tapes. Skip this edition as it sucks. Until there is a better version, spend some extra money and buy a Japanese pressing instead."
4,Fly Fishing for Trout DVD,I had searched locally for a fly fishing DVD without success. I thought of Amazon.com and immediately found this DVD for my friend and the order arrived quickly and in excellent condition. Thank you Amazon.com
5,Get it Now!,"At first, I thought, do we really need another live version of Brainstorm? The answer is undoubtedly- YES! Also, this live album is way better than The Business Trip. The band is basically a four piece line-up (Bridgette can only be heard on a few tracks) at this point, so you can actually hear the music as it's not buried under a barrage of noise. The songs are longer and there is no fake applause, like on The Business Trip. Even more refreshing, is the total lack of those annoying momentum killing poetry readings and aimless keyboard instrumentals. I've had more success converting people to Hawkwind with this CD than any other Hawkwind CD. Also, unlike some other live Hawkwind releases, the quality of the recording is first-rate. Rock On!"
2,Hawkwind - California Brainstorm' (Iloki),"This disc,by some has been refered to as 'a companion CD' to the band's 'Palace Springs' disc since they were both recorded live on the band's 1990 U.S. tour.BELIEVE me,'Palace Springs' is SO much better.The only reason I'm giving this release a two star rating instead of one,is that ""Ejection"" actually sounds pretty decent,but even that track gets snipped off in the last couple of minutes.""Brainstorm"" is a lame-ass mix and most of all ""Refer Madness"" is truly pathetic!For Hawkwind completists ONLY."
1,Brainstorm?,This live set follows the much better 'Palace Springs' set. This disc has nothing worth mentioning as far as a recommended track. Hard to believe this is the same band. Buy at your own risk!
2,Disappointing,"This field guide does not meet the expectations and standards of a Peterson Field Guide. The line drawings are inaccurate and amateurish, not enough pictures, the pictures are not placed in any logical association with the material and too many black and white pictures of poor quality which makes identifying similar corrals and fish difficult. The information seems good but the organization is poor. I am sorry that for the sake of a few bucks I did not get Humann's book instead."
5,A Much Needed Prescription,"Dr. Lawson is a gifted preacher and author, and this book hits the nail on the head. In a day of spineless pulpits in America (not all, thankfully, but far too many), Lawson gives the remedy - preach the word. More than any ten thousand other things we need, we need men of God to be just that -MEN of God that preach and live the scriptures without apology. The American church has been psychologized, contextualized, and Madison Avenued into oblivion without much impact on the surrounding world. Yes, there are exceptions, but they are getting to be fewer and fewer. Lawson has shown the path that God will honor - the systematic, expository preaching of His word. Thank you, Dr. Lawson for an encouraging and edifying read."
5,Concise and direct study on the importance of expository preaching. Great book!,"Pastor Lawson is as clear in writing as in preaching. This book is a brief view of the state of preaching today and the remedies that must be taken in order to deal with the problems the church are facing. With a lot of references, we can go deeper on the study of the matter that is crucial for the church nowadays. It is a must read for those who are worried about how the church is, as well as the kind of preaching that we have from pastors these days. Great book!"
2,Not worth the money for home-based business information.,"I originally purchased this book to learn how to start a gift basket business. I already had some experience but needed the particulars. I found the particulars but wasn't impressed with the information. I felt that the book is biased toward those who have a fair amount of experience and are ambitious enough to undertake a store front, while home-based businesses are made to seem unprofessional. As a person looking to start a home-based business, I felt somewhat intimidated and insulted by the context in which the information was presented."
2,Not Interesting,"I am in the researching stage of my business and thought this book would help me. I was very dissapointed. This book lacks fun and excitement, which is what this business is truely about. Not much of a supplier list, no great marketing ideas, no visuals or basket building tips.Just not very interesting."
3,"Very simple plot, nothing more than we are used to","The Firebird Rocket is not very exciting. There are no overly exciting action sequences, no twisters, just one main thing--the Hardys are directed to Australia where they DO NOT go to very extensive means to search for Doctor Jenson.Also, it just happens that Mike Moran, another person they are looking for, pops out of the dark just when Doctor Jenson does! This is very rare and not likely to happen, for we are given no hints that the two are connected.But everything else, including the trapping of the criminals, the surprise of Professor Young being on the enemy's side, and the ruthless attempts on the brothers' lives, is okay. (I don't mean I want the Hardys to die, however, as the previous sentence may try to reveal.)So go ahead and read this book, but don't expect too much."
4,Great Kid Material,"This was my first Hardy Boys book, and it is very good, though not for older readers. It's a great story for anyone 7-11."
2,Decent considering The Era,"Like all volumes after The Mystery of Spiral Bridge, in plain English they were ""bad"". However this volume is worth reading and did manage to hold my interest. The brothers travel down under and like so many books during this era incorporated way too much educational material about the place they were visiting. Hello - This is a Mystery series - not an atlas! Horrible artwork. No surprise there. Overall the book ranks between horrible and average. It did contain a little suspense in a few places. That is more than I can say about some of the other higher volumes. RATED C-"
2,"An Adventure ""wanabee""","There was no originality in this book, and i knew the end by reading the first page!"
2,Cute but too wordy,"Cute story about a prim and proper schoolteacher who has a secret. Unfortunately, the date it was written really shows because there's just way, way too much text for a picture book. So it takes too long to get the heart of the story, then the end feels rushed."
3,"Crisp, Clear, Pictures but.....","I found little imagination or ""thrills"" in the book. Just pictures of plants, mostly closeup. I guess it's my own fault for wanting to see more ""gardens"" instead of just single plants. I think the title would have been more appropriate if it just said, ""Tropical Plants"", period. The title made you think you would see all of them in garden settings and that was not the majority of the case at all."
5,This CD makes all the other 007 CDs look like [poop],"The Best Of Bond,James Bond is a great disc.The title of this CDreally means what it is saying.There are several 007 soundtracksbut, this is the best.It has every James Bond title song.Plus 2 added James Bond themes from GOLDENEYE and TOMORROW NEVER DIES.Just buy this CD.You will like it."
5,All Originals!!,"Great collection of original Bond movie original songs, even some extra ones (remix?). I was expecting other ""artist"" versions, but these are the actual songs you hear when yoy watch the Bond movies."
4,Best of James Bond by various artists-soundtrack,Best of Bond James BondThe soundtracks of the famous James Bond movies in this CD are sensational and a memorable tribute to 007.
3,Not Quite all there,"I am sorry everyone but sometimes ""newer isn't always better"". If you have the oportunity to do so, GET THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION! With the exception of the two latest movies, It has everything that the 40th ed. has PLUS a second disc of radio promo spots, out-takes, and.... GET THE 30TH ed."
4,"Forget Bond ""Girls"" - Bond Music is GREAT!","I never realized how much I like songs from the James Bond movies. I grew up watching these movies because my dad was such a big fan - and listening to the CD, brought back great memories of watching movies or going to the movies with my dad. It also brought back how much I like some of these songs. Live and Let Die from Paul McCartney is definitely a stand-out track. If you grew up in the 70's or 80's - you'll surely enjoy these songs. A must for any James Bond Fan!!"
5,SOME OF THE BEST MOVIE MUSIC OF ALL TIME.,"The soundtracks of the 007 series are as well known as the plots, gadgets and dialogue. Well deserved and time honored, this 22 song CD features some of Hollywood's best tracks. The nicest surprise is WE HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD, a lush love ballad that features the unmistakeable Burt Bachrach-Hal David orchestration. Personally, in no particular order, the best: THUNDERBALL, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Put this one on the top shelf of your collection."
2,Anybody got Tape ???,"Product OK -- Shipping package terrible !! Shipping box arrived open,partial damage to contents due wholly to inadequate taping and preparation of shipping box. Pinching penneys and loosing customers makes a company smaller and less able to compete, NOT very smart."
1,Past their expiration date!,"I recently received these potato chips and they were past their expiration date. They were also packaged very poorly and the box was smashed and one of the bags was open. I complained to Amazon and they said they would send another which would be fresh. They did replace it and the packaging was much better, but still the expired date on the chips! Come on Amazon, you can't send out old food! And why would they waste the money shipping out another item with an expired date? The date is printed right on the box that holds the chips!"
1,Thought Disordered Nonsence.,"I couldn't find a single topic that this book dealth with better than good-old, less-than-perfect Kaplan and Sadock. I can't think of a book that less deserves to be a classic. I'd like to hear from anyone who recons they know an area this book deals with better than K&S."
1,"If you want to sell something, you have to show what it is.","Why bother wasting people's time listing products that do not have a picture of what is included, nor a written description of the items?"
4,These gymnasts are great.,"America's Best V.1 is a really good gymnastics video, if you're interensted in the gymnasts from 1992. Kim Zemskal wins beating out competitors such as Kerri Strug, Dominique Daws, and Michelle Campie. If you're a fan of Shannon Miller you might want to know that she's not in it due to elbow surgery. She only competed compulseries which they only show optionals."
3,America's Best: First Edition,"This is just an incomplete recording of NBC's airing of the 1992 National Gymnastics Championships. Doesn't include any optional performances of Shannon Miller. Video is centered on the great '91 World Champion, Kim Zmeskal. Other performances include Michelle Campi, Kerri Strug, and if I can remember, Amanda Borden.The video also shows a bit of the men's competition from this event. There is some footage of 1992 Olympic High Bar Champion, Trent Dimas, who is one of the least profiled Olympic Champions in U.S.A. Gymnastics.All in all I give this vhs video a B - not the best but not bad either for fans of U.S. gymnast from this era."
2,Not Watermelon Wave,"Just got my shipment. It was for the regular bubbilicious watermelon, NOT watermelon wave. I called and customer service handled this accordingly. Very satisfied with the way Amazon handled the order mix up. Just a heads up for anyone who is going to order watermelon wave!"
3,Good syrup,I like this product but I wish they had the brown sugar and cinnamon syrup available on here. I didn't find it through my search so ended up with this one but it isn't as good to me.
2,Get the 1994 concept album!,"There are so many reasons why the 1994 album is superior, but my favorite has to be this:Can anyone tell me who thought the lyrics, ""Give me this moment/ This momentous moment"" were a good idea?-Rick"
2,not so good....,"I bought this because I really loved Colm Wilkinson in Les Miserables, all 3 recordings of it I've heard with him, and also enjoyed his Stage Heroes CD. I own the Complete Work of Jekyll & Hyde too, and it blows this one away. I don't even think it is that great, but I must say it is much better than this. LETTING GO is probably the one song on this that I like. I don't think Colm gives a very good performance of Jekyll/Hyde, he sounds like he's just singing another song. Linda Eder sounds good, but I don't think the songs are well written. So in short, buy the Complete Work if you want Jekyll & Hyde, or spend your money elsewhere if you don't."
2,"What happened, Colm?","Now, normally, I am a BIG fan of Colm Wilkinson, but this just isn't right. I'm not sure if the music isn't right for him or the character, but he does not do the role justice. If you want Jekyll and Hyde, get another recording."
5,Early Jeckle & Hyde,"This is a great CD for Linda Eder fans. The two female lead parts in Jeckle & Hyde are sung by Linda in this concept album. If you have her later CD's as I do you can see how she has developed but her unique style and beautiful tones were there even in 1990. This album opens with ""Once Upon a Dream"" a gorgeous solo by Linda and has several of the best songs from the Broadway musical, Jeckle & Hyde . If you like Jeckle & Hyde or Linda Eder you will love this CD!"
3,See this show!!,"Of the three Jekyll & Hyde recordings available, this one would be my last pick. It's a collection of the more mainstream songs in the score, performed by only two people. Colm Wilkinson, an incredible Valjean, makes a less than optimal Jekyll/Hyde. The concept recording allows Linda Eder to play with some of the vocal parts, and it's beautiful. She's a powerful performer, though I think she lacks the requisite sweetness needed to portray Lisa accurately. She's a wonderful Lucy. Listen to it, buy the 1994 concept recording, and definitely see the show... it's fabulous."
1,Laughably Bad,"This is a dreadful excuse for Broadway. The instrumentation is like that of disposable 1980's easy listening. The always over-rated Colm Wilkinson gives his worst and most vocally uneven recorded performance on CD. Linda Eder sings beautifully, though, but the cheesy electric piano arrangements kill the experience. Don't waste your money or time on this. Purchase either of the other two recordings that are actually scored and at least demonstrate the final vision of this mediocre piece. But, if you love Jennifer Warnes, Helen Reddy, and Anne Murray, then this is the CD for you!"
1,Colm Wilkins...ugh,"I had first bought Jekyll and Hyde with Anthony Warlow, and LOVED it, so when I was looking to see if they had anymore other Jekyll CD's, I ran across this one and bought it. I wish I hadn't. Colm Wilkins playing this role was just wrong. He just doesn't know how to sing, but that's just my opinion. Linda Eder sounded MUCH better in the new Jekyll CD as opposed to this one. All in all, I'd say don't waste your money on this CD."
3,What?,"(...) Hasslehoff however, if he did a recording you'd never tell the difference in Confrontaiton. Now to this CD. Colm is horrible and i really don't care about lucy or lisa. I gave this three stars cause the songs are different than the ones i'm used to and this gives good Fun on imitating Colm Wilkonson. Don't get me wrong Colm is good (Only as Valjean). And how come we don't like Colm but we like Sean Connery. (...)"
5,Great for beginning readers,"My three year old son received these cards along with the Hot Dots Talking Pen from Santa Claus this year. Even though he also received some flashy electronic toys and play food, this was the first thing he played with when he finished opening his presents. He loves the sense of gratification he gets from getting the right answer and hearing the pen say, ""Correct!"" He is also learning to recognize more words thanks to these cards. He can select the word ""purple"" from the choices on the card because he knows it starts with ""p."" And how he is starting to go around spelling the different colors and numbers that are on these cards. Very educational, inexpensive, and great for beginning readers."
4,slow start great ending,it does not seam to be love story.. but at the end make you wish you were loved as much as Aguilar loved Agustina
3,Great and disappointing at the same time,"This book is one of those you pick up knowing how interesting the drama and setting of it is, yet Restrepo's way of writing can be very confusing at times. There is no real sequence and at the end you end up waiting for more, that which it does not deliver after such a long and difficult reading."
1,Incredibly boring,"Reading this book was a total waste of time. When I read the back cover it seemed as if the book was going to be very interesting. However, it was disappointing. The author uses a strange style that actually makes the book difficult to read. That alone would not be so bad if the plot was good, but it isn't. I finished the book expecting something interesting to happen, nothing ever did. This is a boring book, and a real disappointment."
1,What a disappointment/Qué decepcion,"I had read a lot of reviews on this book, at first very positive ones and then very bad ones. The theme of this book is very weak or it is not fully exploited. I was expecting so much more of this book. I wanted to finish reading it soon not because it was good, but because it was SO BAD that I wanted to get my hands on a good book. Restrepo didn't focus on anything, she jumped from the situation of an affluent family in Colombia linked to drug trafficking, to a murder in a gym, to the life of the daughter who goes crazy, etc. The whole book presents a picture of life in Colombia to some extent but it only scratches the surface, and the result is a boring, confusing book. Furthermore, Laura Restrepo writes the same way as the master Saramago, but with so much less continuity that I think she should not try to write this way again. In four words: Don't buy this book!"
4,A great celtic worship album,"i hear this album for my love for the celtic music, the song are very original and captive the spirit of the music of the highlander people, his style, his life, devotion and love from his country, y recomended this cd for other fans of the celtic music, the arrenged are nice, very quiet, perfect for mediation moment, a great hit from discorvery music."
1,Nothing Celtic about this cd,"Please save your money because I am really crying celticly. The only resemblance to anything ""Celtic"" is the downloaded travel photo of a Scottish? castle and a wee bit of penny whistle. Give me a break. This cd was produced with the high tech majesty of a Nashville studio - and it was. I'm very particular about Christian Celtic music and this is not it. Great ""packaged"" lyrics. Someone in America is trying to sell you something. Sounds familiar! Very Unhappy - I returned for refund."
5,celtic cry,Celtic Cry is a cd filled with beautiful music. I especially like the pipes in the first song-welcoming hills. Each song refreshes the mind. To know GOD and share in HIS peace is an awesome joy and Celtic Cry reminds us of the battle we face daily with the promises yet to come.
2,Good CD but not a Pagan CD,"Very pretty with vocals and insturmentals. However, if you're looking for something that's actually Pagan and has Yule carols keep looking."
1,Bag Was Crap,"Bag was said to be diamomd plate this means it was made out of scraps.Totally junk,You get what you pay for"
3,More of a romance novel than paranormal,"This book was recommended to me because I love a good paranormal story. I was a tad disappointed in the fact that it was more romance involved and only got spooky at the beginning and the very end of the book. The two main characters sort of got on my nerves about how they were so very deceitful to each other, but always seemed to forgive one another for horrible things that they did to each other. That was kind of unbelievable, but then again it is a fiction novel. It was good enough for me to finish the entire book, but like I said I was told it was more a paranormal novel so I kept waiting for something spooky to happen chapter after chapter. If you like just romance novels, then this is for you. If you like a good spooky novel, before reading this, I would suggest you look elsewhere first."
3,more romance than I really wanted..,"This book was recommended to me because I love a good paranormal story.

If you like just romance novels, then this is for you. If you like a good spooky novel, before reading this, I would suggest you look elsewhere first."
4,An interesting read,"When I first heard that Kat Martin was writing a contemporary novel, I was very interested. I've always enjoyed reading her historical romance. Silent Rose is a good book. If your the type who go for ghosts and goblins and other supernatural beings (as I do) then this is one book you shouldn't miss. The only thing that made me hold back on that last star were the moments when the book dragged a bit. Devon and Jonathan are interesting characters though that hold your attention even through the slow pages. The kicker for me was the postcript from the author which says that some of the events described in the book happened to her! Makes you think more about the other ""beings"" existing in with us........"
1,Modern Romance,"I did not enjoy this book at all. I dont like modern romamces and I bought the book because martin always writes historical romances, so i didnt bother reading the synopsis and just bought the book. well, that was a mistake, i couldnt evem get past the third chapter of the book before i gaveup on it. i dont recomend this book at all."
2,Interesting storyline but didn't keep my attention,This was an interesting storyline but found the story to be boring
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!,"MAN OH MAN! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME! THIS BOOK WAS ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE! IF YOU LOVE KAT MARTIN LIKE I DO, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK, SHE MAY TARNISH HER IMAGE WITH IT. FOR YOU FIRST TIME MARTIN READERS... STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE... THIS ISNT HER USUAL STYLE AND THIS BOOK DOES NOT REFLECT HER TALENT! DONT SAY I DIDNT WARN YOU! ~HEY KAT.. STICK WITH THE HISTORICAL ROMANCE... IT SUITS YOU."
2,"tepid romance, boring book","The ghost-story aspect of this book was what caught my interest, and I kept reading hoping that it would be brought more into the forefront. Unfortunately, the rather boring romantic aspects of the story seemed to be the main focus. It mostly consisted of the main characters saying ""damn you"" to each other. Also, what was up with the Japanese mistress and the sex scene in the limo? This type of thing may be standard in Regency romances (substitute ""carriage"" for limo), but they just didn't fly right in this book."
3,"Good atmosphere, but overall disappointing","This was one of the few paranormal romances I've read where the paranormal element was actually spooky.Unfortunately, the hero, Jonathan, deceives the heroine and tries to charm her into doing what he wants. The heroine, Devon, does her share of deception, but Jonathan commits the most transgressions.The weakest part of the novel, however, was the subplot involving Devon's former fiance. This could have been chopped out without hurting the novel.I gave this book a C- at All About Romance."
3,Not a fan of sinister,I have really enjoyed most everything I have read by Kat Martin...except this book. It was sinister and dark and those are just not my favorite flavors for a story I want to relax with.
2,Stick with the historicals Kat!,"What can I say? I felt like I wasted mymoney! Boring and stupid! I love Kat Martin, but not her contemporaries!"
2,don't bother with this one,"I have read all of Kat Martin's historical romances. This was her first foray into the contemporary genre. She'd be wise to stay with the historicals.I could not find any redeemimg quality with the hero, and the heroine was unworthy of the story itself.I do not recommednd that a first time buyer of any Kat Martin work purchase this novel. For that matter, I don't think anyone should spend their money on this book at all."
4,"Bright and durable, but no magnet as pictured.","The one I received was black. It has two hooks for hanging, one on top and one on bottom. The cord is very long. Good enough for most shop applications. Also has two switches, one for each bulb (very nice). I only wish it came with a magnet, as shown in picture.All in all, a good buy."
3,Not bad,"Works as advertised. Kinda clunky, unrefined. I'd like to have this much light in a smaller lighter unit. Arrived promptly and was nicely packaged. 25 Ft cord is much appreciated."
2,my old 65 watt single light bulb lamp is brighter than this......,"construction is fair for the price, cord length is great, and for the money it's mostly all there except for the light....i have an old one of these that uses just plain standard old light bulbs , like the 39 cents kind, and does a better job than this with both sides kicked on, i searched for a number of hours on amazon trying to find the highest rating in my price range for a light of this type, after reading all of the reviews i ended up here and am pretty disappointed ended up going with a halogen flood light and some led stick on things to get the light i needed where i needed it, really i just wish it threw more light, i wasn't expecting much, just better than my old light bulb powered one...."
4,good light as long as you have a place to hang it!,Provides goodly amount of light as long as you have someone else to hold it for you. Ample light and usefully long cord. I suspect it may be a little fragile though and if you have to set it down ( say in an attic or crawlspace it only can shine up ).
4,very nice,I only gave it four stars because its so expensive. It is good qaulity and makes the bed look good. Cushion isntreally. Thick but it is ok.
4,Pretty Good,This was my second Fish solo cd I listened to. A very good cd but still seems to lack the full blown emotion in the song writing. Obviously I wasnt expecting the lyrics of the past but I long for another album to totally capture my emotions.
5,one of the greats,"Wow, this soundtrack was infinitely better than the movie, which, although extremely green, wasn't spectacular. All the tracks are great but for me the standouts are Pulp's ""Like a Friend"" (ooooohhh I love it) the Tori Amos and Mono songs. The rest of the soundtrack is great but these are the songs I repeat."
4,"Half Good, Half Bad","About the first half of this CD is wonderful. Tori Amos' two tracks are wonderfully inventive, and very dark. Chris Cornell's ""Sunshower"" is an outstanding edgy and almost obsessive acoustic song. The trend of goodness continues till almost the midway point of the album, with tracks from Duncan Sheik and Poe. From there--it's a sharp slide, marked by one TERRIBLE song. ""Lady, Your Roof Brings Me Down,"" as performed by former STP frontman Scott Weiland, is just wretched. I found it almost unlistenable, and have, at times, been forced to turn off the CD. However, the outstanding first half of the CD makes it worthwhile, especially ""Sunshower,"" ""Like a Friend,"" ""Life in Mono,"" and ""Siren."""
4,"Mostly because of Chris Cornell's rare gem ""Sun Shower...""","Loved the movie, but what stuck out to me the most was Chris Cornell's ""Sun Shower"" playing during the sensual, provocative scene between Finn and Estella. Completely amplified the moment and made that scene, and the rest of the film instantly memorable. Well, at least to me anyway. :) Main reason I bought this soundtrack. Might be some other good tunes on it though. I'll have to see. ;)"
1,"This was a sad collection of simplistic, insipid music.",this entire compilation offers almost no challenge to the listener except the brief reprieve from monotony which tori amos delivers.
5,Unique Track 03: Tori Amos Complete Lyrics (Siren),"And you know you're gonna lie to youIn your own wayAnd you know you're gonna lie to youIn your own wayAnd I lie some other dayYou doAnd you say girlKnow too wellKnow the chillKnow she breaksMy sirenKnow teenage fleshKnow the chillKnow she breaksMy sirenNever was one for a prissy girlCoquette call in for an ambulanceReach high, doesn't mean she's holyJust means she's got a cellular handyAlmost brave, almost pregnantAlmost in loveVanillaVanillaAnd you know you're gonna lie to youIn your own wayAnd you know you're gonna lie to youIn your own wayAnd you don't need the light onTo guide you through the southern landsGo said go, yesKnow too wellKnow the chillKnow she breaksMy sirenKnow teenage fleshKnow the chillKnow she breaksMy sirenNever was one for a prissy girlCoquette call in for an ambulanceReach high, doesn't mean she's holyJust means she's got a cellular handyAlmost brave, almost pregnantAlmost in loveVanilla..."
5,Lauren Christy's track is outstanding!,"Brilliant singer-songwriter Lauren Christy's Walk This Earth Alone weaves a musical web around the listener with its impassioned vocals, riveting melody and intense production."
5,Compelling and Beautiful,"This soundtrack is one of the most beautiful collections of music I've ever heard. Life in Mono and Siren have to be 2 of the most passionate songs I've ever heard. They comsume you with their twisted melodies and when you listen your mind goes on a rage and your heart fills with desire. This soundtrack moves me to levels of passion, desire, and romance hardly anything or one can do. I can liten to it constantly and be filled with the same emotions and excitement as the first time I heard the songs in the movie. (which by the way is one of the best movies of all time) If you have any suggestions of other cds or soundtracks with this kind of intensity. Email me @ BellaAngel@bolt.com."
5,Fabulous,"When asked if I have an all time favorite ""album"" this is it. I have purchased it three times due to scratches, losing it, loaning it to friends that never give it back, etc. Would highly recommend it to everyone. It surpasses all genres of music and takes one for a quite a ride."
4,Great variety!,This CD has a variety of musical styles and is enjoyable to listen to. Tori Amos lovers will adore the first two tracks which are not available on any of Tori's CD's. Other great songs include tracks eight and ten.
5,Expect the Great from Great Expectations,"Great Expectations was a great movie, and I bought the soundtrack because I really loved ""Life in Mono"" by Mono. There is a varied selection from this soundtrack, and it's really worth to add this to your collection, if you like soundtrack music. I also recommend Mono's debut album, ""Formica Blues."""
3,Pick and Choose,"Some songs on here are okay, but others are worth playing over and over. Track one I always skip over. Track 3, ""Life in Mono,"" is one of the songs you'll want to play over again. Track 7, ""Wishful Thinking,"" is good. Duncan Shiek is one of my favorite singers...very sexy voice. Other good tracks are #9, #11, #12, and #16."
3,it's ok - not your first choice for either piece,"I've reconsidered this recording; originally I gave it an unkind review, and now that applies only to the Tchaikovsky.Well, this is not going to be your ""go-to"" recording of Tchaikovsky's 1st piano concerto. There is just too much noise. Unless you're interested in Toscanini, there is no reason to endure this.For Mussorgsky's Pictures - the original piano version, of course - this is a decent choice. The sound is dated, so you might want to look into a more recent recording. But I do genuinely enjoy this. Horowitz squeezes every little detail out of the work, which has become one of my favorites."
5,On-time and good insight,This book tells about the pros and cons of Human Resources in the Health Care field. I would recommend it to whomever is considering this line of work.
5,A STORY IS LIKE THE WIND..,"I believe it is a proverb of the African bushmen, ""A story is like the wind, it comes from a far-off quarter, and we feel it.""Those words were invented to describe this stirring gem from Baricco.His prose feels much like a light autumn breeze, soft yet wondrously mermerizing. With ballad-like refrains and sublime descriptions of the harmonious way of Japanese life, we are drawn into an evocative portrait of what it means to be human, at our most elemental, and the effect is awesome.The hypnotic curiosity of a distant unrequited love leads the novel to its stark and tempestuos end, which lingers in your mind long after you've turned the last page in bewilderment.I have never read such an effortlessly haunting saga of compassion, obsession, intrigue. Kudos to the translator for retaining Baricco's original Italian delicacy.It takes about 2 hours to journey between the novel's shores, but I bet you'll take the voyage more than once."
3,Disappointed....,"Having finished _Ocean Sea_ shortly before reading _Silk_, I was hoping it would be as well written and poetic. Perhaps it was the use of a different translator that failed to reflect the beauty of the original writing. It might have been that the story was not as intriguing. In any case, if you're looking for a repeat of the sensual, luscious writing from _Ocean Sea_, I would not recommend this read."
5,WOW!!!! incredible,"It's amazing how an ""average"" book, becomes, at the end, in one of the most incredible and beautiful books one can ever read. The bad part is that only took me little bit more than a couple of hours to read it... you just can't put it down... once you finished, you'll want to read it again and again... highly recomended"
5,Intriguiging Writing,"It has all of the things I like about a novel--it has information, entertainment, and originality. And it has brevity to boot. (Methinks Micheal Faber should perchance learn Italian and sit at Barrico's feet for a while--a 1,000 pages do not a good book make). It's so small that it barely rates the term novella, and along with Sky Burial, these two books are perfect travel companions, a pair of pleasurable books ideal for that short flight or car trip that only last a few hours.And that's what this book is--pleasurable. It is a quick, interesting read, and the writing is gob-smacking original, some of the most original I've seen in ages. You can--as most of the reviewers have pointed out--easily read it in one sitting and I highly recommend it. Fufilling and meaningful, informative and short. All the best in one slender book."
5,Passion as forceful as a hurricane,I have never read a book which manages to portray the passion of a relationship in the way Baricco describes it. He manages to bring out the immaturity of man in contrast with the stoicity of woman. I have rarely been moved as much as after having read this book.
2,Nothing special,"I thought this book would be brilliant given all the hype. It was alright, the style of writing wasn't really amazing, and the story was something of a short-story fairytale. There were flashes of passion that picked me up in places, however, and I enjoyed the end. I think I may be biased by the fact that I don't like short stories (I loathe lack of characterization) and by the looks of it, Ocean Sea is a much better book."
2,nothing special,"The writing is occasionally good, but highly repetitive and suffers from poor character development. The author has an orientalist notion of Japan - what little he knows is likely derived from a tour guide and some Geisha pulp literature. Those who are smitten by the ""exotic"" will love this drivel. The only thing noteworthy about Silk is a particularly erotic passage that is well received after the absurdity that precedes it."
5,This is the best!,Purchased this for my sons attic room. It is a great quality wall art. It looks wonderful and went on smoothly. It is also thicker than other wall art I have bought.
5,Great gift.,My mother was extremely excited to recieve this dvd as a present and has not taken it out of her dvd player sence.
2,Needs the Whole Show!,Saw the Vegas show. Ask me again if you release the entire show on DVD. Such a shame it's edited.
4,Bette Midler Fans,"I bought it to go with ""Diva Las Vegas"", another DVD. It's very entertaining. Especially liked the number ""Great Big Knockers"". A must have for ""Divine Miss M"" fans."
2,"Even die-hard fans, don't bother","I'm sure this was an incredible show at an incredible venue, but you'd never know if from the DVD. This is the worst produced DVD ever in the history of the world. The audio quality is horrible, and the video isn't much better. For gosh sakes this is LAS VEGAS in the super showroom built to house Ms Dion for five years, you know they've got the very best sound and video available, but this DVD is just a bad afterthought. It's a shame, because Ms Midler has always been captured best live on camera, and she has a whole catalogue of HBO shows that were extremely well done (but apparently aren't available today).I've loved Bette Midler her entire career, but this DVD is absolutely a piece of crap. Do not bother. It is an insult to one of the great talents of all time."
2,Very Disappointed,"I saw Bette live at the MGM in Las Vegas several years ago and she was FANTASTIC! A true entertainer but, sadly, this DVD does not capture the true Divine Miss M. This concert is poorly and unnecessarily edited. The enthusiasm, the energy, the naughtiness is not there. I don't understand why this concert DVD had to be edited and not show the entire concert in it's full out, true form? I love Bette but this DVD shows her to be, dare I say, 'tired' - as she so mentions."
2,disapointing,"Very Disapointed in quality of video. Picture was not sharp like most digitals and audio was not real clear. The show looked almost like a pirated filming done by an audience member instead of a film crew. It's also only 62 minutes long when the actual performance was more than 90. Glad I didn't pay more for it, and Amazons service was amazing and very fast. Thanks for that part. I'll never watch it again. Tom"
1,Bette Midler The Show Must Go On,"BUYER BEWARE!!! I should have read other reviews here before buying this ripoff. I was very disappointed when viewing this. It has been chopped up, and all this DVD has on it is Miss M singing, and a few times, off key. All the skits have been removed, for what reason I can not understand. How could she do this to her fans. The DVD is 67 minutes long. If it were not for the showgirls, and costumes it would have been worse. Seems like they carried the entire show.It was their show.If Miss M reads these reviews, and I hope she does, you have let all your fans down. I will think twice before buying any future DVD or CD that she is producing.SHAME ON YOU BETTE."
3,bette is great the show was not,bette midler is amazing but A LOT!! is omitted. the full show is 90 min the dvd is 67min delores delago is not in the show and the jokes are few. i wish it was more like the other concert dvd Divine MadnessDivine Madnessbut with the peggy lee songs rosemary colony songs and the other songs from her more resent cds. It is just not as good as i was hoping (buy it used not new 14.99 is to much )
4,Wild Tornado,"""The Showgirl Must Go On"" entertained me from beginning to end. I've listened to Bette's recordings for decades, but have never seen her live. This DVD opens with a wild tornado that lands us in a whirlwind of dancing girls, bright colors, music and Bette. Most powerful for me was her performance of ""From A Distance,"" one of the serious songs tucked within the show. Looking great in an orange flowing gown, Bette reaches her hands up almost as if she had a direct line to the Almighty. Also amazing was her powerful performance of John Prine's ""Hello In There."" Now in her 60s, Bette seemed to have great empathy for old people who ""grow lonesome."" Toni Basil, who's one hit ""Mickey"" came in the early 80s, does the choreography. On ""Do You Wanna Dance,"" it is a breathtaking combination of umbrellas that pop open and close with the lights pink and blue. When the DVD ended, I wished there were more. Enjoy!"
3,Where was Delores?,"I just watched my newly purchased ""Bette Midler - The Showgirl Must Go On."" Having seen the show live at Caesar's Palace three years ago, I was disappointed in the fact that Bette chose to include fillers of ""The Caesar Salad Girls"" and didn't include Delores, the Mermaid. ""Delores"" was wonderful and Bette is so well known for this character. :("
1,Really Disappointed,"I have been a fan since I was a teenager. When I heard about the Las Vegas show I was really excited and after seeing it on HBO I'm glad I wasn't able to see it there. Miss Midler seems to have phoned the show in. I wish she were hungry enough to try something unique again. This was just a rehashing of old hits and tedious patter. (Her patter used to be sharp and reflective, now it's whining) Miss Midler, there are plenty of new hits for you in the universe. Did Bruce Vilanche help you write this show? Perhaps he needs a makeover as well. Bette Midler has always been the one to reinvent the stage. I hope she does it again."
1,"Yuck, awful.","I've been a Bette fan from the first; if you want to see her true self, get Divine Madness. It is divine. This one is a Las Vegas show, certainly not her best."
1,Poorly edited and phoned in,"This badly edited version of the original nearly 2-hour Vegas show originally aired on HBO and was an immediate disappointment to all her fans. I'm a fan from the beginning, the ""...on the Half Shell"" review and shows, and for this to be her supposed final taped release is a crime. What happened to HBO and Bette?"
3,Bette Midler: The Showgirl,I cannot se the the film on my DVD-player becauce I live in another region than the product is made for. So I can not buy normal DVD film from Amazon. I Haven't seen the film.Kindly John Srensen
1,Horrible,One of the worst Blu-rays I have had the misfortune to watch!What was her management company thinking?Absolutely horrible!
2,REALLY?,This DVD has been edited and chopped beyond belief! I saw the show in Vegas and it was at least 90 minutes of pure joy. This DVD is only 67 minutes with Delores Delago completely edited out! WHY BOTHER? Very disapointed!
1,and now for something completely different...D'Oh!,"First off, let's say I'm disappointed. I own previous works of Graham Wiggins, the didjeridoo guy on this album. I've got Outback:Baka, Outback:Dance the Devil Away, Dr. Didg:Out of the Woods, Dr. Didg: Serotonality. This album is a significant departure from his past works. It's electronica dominated and not all that sophisticated. To be blunt, it's not an album that I care to play."
3,"Simple, soft sounds",This makes a nice softish sound and is easy for our preschool-aged children to use. But the children much prefer the other instruments we purchased--real Latin ones intended for adult use.
2,Cheap,"I really don't understand the title ""soprano crow sounder""-- it really does not produce much of any type of sound. I purchased a large amount of these to be used in a classroom- I'll have to wait and see how they hold up. They are cheap and you get what you pay for."
4,"Good information, much here for breeders.","This book has good information for feeding and care of African Grey Parrots. I wish there had been more on training, however the breeding sections are excellent."
4,Very good informations!,Book is nicely writen and it has tons of good information about all aspect in term of raising greys. I can definitely tell the writer really loves her greys.
3,Good if you want to breed your own,"I have purchased every book I can find on African Greys, and this book had extreamly detailed information on breeding and handfeed babies, but if you are only looking for information on greys and how to raise them after they are weaned, you can find the very same information, in much less expensive books."
4,Good for Party Music,This has the songs that Make you want to Shake your Groove Thing. Thoose Good ole 70's Jump up and DANCE songs. You HAVE TO Enjoy this CD.
2,a powerful subject- but too much unfounded blame,"It's almost sacrilegious of me to be a Mental Health professional and not like such a book that tackles such a powerful subject. But I can't recomend a book that refuses to discuss the relationship between domestic violence and substance abuse. Upon finnishing this book I could only recall two MINOR refrences to alcohol. I was hoping for a factual, non bias, historical discussion about domestic violence and possably some treatment- instead I got a blame session."
3,The Girl Who Knows The Truth,The reason why I name this book what I did was. Because in the story every one that thought Hitler didn't have a daughter. story of Hitler's daughter was. Because here sister has just it was her sister second day of school and she asked did anyone wanted to play the. Story game and the little girl said yes she did want to play so they did play and. That when the girl started to tell the story of Hitler's Daughter. So then after she told the story of Hilter's Daughter and then the other kids who was at the bus stop wanted to hear the rest of it to she if she was telling the truth so she told them.To she what happened you would have to read the book or if you have read the book you can write one and tell some one the story also.
4,Hitler's Daughter,"The reason why I gave this book 4 stars was because it is the kind of book that I like, its mysterious and gives a lot of details. As difference to the other books this one is very easy to read and has few words I didnt understood. Also something that I liked of this book was that it was a fiction book, and it was a very interesting book too."
3,grizzly dividers,"for the price you can't beat it but it has a couple of design issues.1) it would be nice if the pencil holder was alittle bigger2) when you use a pencil the most you ca compress it is about a 1"" because the pencil holder is not angleed in"
3,You'll be disappointed.,"This is the weakest of the many Bob Rivers Christmas albums. There are the usual parodies of Christmas songs, which aren't quite as funny as usual. And then there are the parodies of non-Christmas songs, which are transformed into Christmas songs. They do sound a lot like the performers they are imitating (the B-52's, Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix), but the jokes aren't half as funny as they think they are. One peculiar one is a parody of the Rolling Stones' ""Get Off of My Cloud"", but it is done in the style of Frank Sinatra. Still, it is a moderately funny album. And I do like ""There's a Santa Who Looks a Lot Like Elvis""."
3,"Okay, but the first Twisted CD is better","The Bob Rivers crew mostly went the mainstream route here, so the parodies are mostly of non-Christmas songs. The one track I like best is The Most Fattening Time of the Year. Richard Simmons adds so much to this, it's hysterical. That song alone made this disc worth getting, but I'm not too crazy about the other selections."
3,funny,"We listened to this cd and had a really fun time w/ it, we laughed out loud and replayed several songs several times for a good laugh."
3,So what if others have written similar books?,"The Magic Life is a parable about a universal truth -- we each are our own life's magician and we have control. Yes, others have said it. But I like the way this book approaches it. It is fun, it is simple, and the lesson is absorbed without effort.Mr. Starry's book is a story of self-discovery. It does not promise that a life of magic is without pain. It DOES promise that a life of magic is richer.So yes, go ahead and read Illusions and Seagull by Bach too. They too talk of self discovery and self-magery. But do not miss this book -- it is a hug for the soul."
1,This material has been done better by others.,"If you're looking for an introduction to basic spiritual philosophy, the Celestine Prophecy is a much better written book with a more interesting story line. The Education of Oversoul Seven, Ismael, and Illusions (by Richard Bach)also come to mind. Don't waste your time or money on this book. Not only is this story a rehash of others who've gone before, the writing is uninspired and simplistic."
4,In praise of THE MAGIC LIFE,"Having come upon Mr. Starry's book while supporting the ""hungersite"" on the internet, I purchased it more out of curiosity than anything. Thus set up for any eventual disappointment, I was so pleasantly surprised by ""The Magic Life"" that I re-read it immediately. With so much of today's writing centering on tragic childhoods, debilitating relationships and general whining, I found Mr. Starry's book to be light, entertaining, inspiring and all around uplifting. With its chatty style and positive approach it conveys the idea that making constructive changes to better our lives is more about 'attitudes' than 'latitudes'. Thanks to Mr. Starry for a book I'm proud to share with my friends, in all their diversity."
5,You are the magician! Enjoy!,"This book came into my life as magically as some of the things that happened in the life of its main character, James Carpenter. It is an entertaining and enjoyable journey where I experienced joy, wonder, sadness, compassion, deja vu, aliveness, laughter, and synchronicity.It is full of fascinating life philosophy, and it gave me wonderful reminders and fresh perspectives on truths that work for me in life when I remember to apply them!And I love ""The trick is to make magic out of living!"" This book inspired me to expand the magic in my life and to share that with others!If you have heart's desires and dreams that you have kept on the back burner, this is the book for you. If you want more love in your life, more life in your love, then this is the book for you. You are the magician! Enjoy!"
1,"Boring, uninteresting, slow","How awful!I'm a keen reader, but this one was unbeareable....I could not get past the first 50 pages,though try I did! Can't understand how anyone can possibly get inspiration from it..."
3,Not bad 3/5,"Was not a bad video just found it to short for viewing and allot of the steps were not shown. I was very disappointed in the way the braid was not secured or at least a part of the vid showing how to close the micro braid by tieing or by nail glue not bad. On a positive side she did emphasize how to initiate the micro braid so now I am my own pro at starting a micro braid, thank you Marquetta."
5,Selena Movie Soundtrack,"When I was living in L.A. with my brother-my brother asked who was Selena.I did'nt know who she was after hearing about her trajic death that year.I saw the movie on HBO later on my own and loved it.I got into Selena's music inculding this soundtrack.This remastered soundtrack is outstanding-The spoken liner notes by the band and family members is very interesting.This edition includes lyrics as well.The music itself-so wonderful and good.Whether it's in english or spanish-I still love it.Okay,I'm a Gringo who loves all types of music incudling Selena."
1,Ordered this and received Classic Caramel instead,"I ordered this individual bottle instead of the three pack hoping that this way I would get the plain sugar free Caramel flavor instead of the ""Classic"" which the reviewers of the three pack complained of receiving. Well guess what, I received the ""Classic"" Caramel flavor which is absolutely horrible! The box that this glass bottle shipped in said Torani Sugar Free Caramel but inside was the Classic version. I do not know if Torani packs these individual bottles and ships them to Amazon and there was a problem with Torani's labeling or if Amazon packs these and labels them and someone in the warehouse isn't paying attention but the result is the same, nasty syrup. I called customer service and he didn't sound particularly surprised but did appologize and advise me he would see that the issue was corrected."
5,This Workout Is Awesome!,"I've been working out at home for 10 years and this is the most fun, innovative workout I have seen in some time. It is totally different from anything else out there. The music is awesome and the length (45 minutes) is just right for me. JAC is a very motivating, likable instructor. I've been getting tired of the same old stuff out there. Thankfully this workout has come along and revitalized my routine.Challenging for advanced exercisers this workout includes lot's of innovative core work mostly with a stability ball and interesting use of a paper plate. Great results are achieved in 45 minutes without endless reps. Buy this one, you won't regret it."
5,This Work Out Rocks!,"This is the best core work out I have ever done. I never new I was in such bad shape. Jeanne Anne is so great and the work out is so much fun. It is different from anything out there. It is so challenging. The day I can master the "" Tick Tock"" move will be a very happy day for me."
3,An American Legend???,"Imagine. The one of the greatest icons - Winchester: An American Legend. Now, imagine it's printed in China. Yeah, stuff of legend!"
2,Beware,"If you loved The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, you may not enjoy this book. Although it provides valuable Numenorean historical information, it is comprised of unfinished stories. Tolkein's son Christopher has annotated passages, and he includes his notes at the end of each tale. This is sometimes helpful, sometimes not. He points out the obvious. A lot.There are some fairly interesting tidbits in here, though. The book shows you exactly how Tolkein started writing about the history of mankind inheriting the world.So, only read it if you're looking to learn about Numenor or how Tolkein thought up Middle Earth, otherwise, stick to The Silmarillion and Lost Tales."
5,Another great by Christopher Tolkien,"In the fifth volume of The History of Middle Earth, Christopher Tolkien brings to light even more of his father's great stories. What started as a competition between Inkling members J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis almost became what looks to be a very good story (it ends after only two chapters), and was the foreshadowing of an even greater story--the Fall of Numenor. Tolkien also includes the later Annals of both Valinor and Beleriand, not to mention an early version of the Ainulindale. He also teases die hard fans with the Llamas and the Etymologies, which give new insight on Elvish languages. Also included is Tolkien's second Silmarillion map which shows how his understanding of Middle Earth's geography evolved. I recommend this book to any die hard Tolkien fan and to those who are casually strolling through this beautiful world of Middle Earth."
5,Adding to the History,A mandatory piece of the History of Middle Earth. Contributes greatly to the overall story line. Important for long-time and dedicated Tolkien fans like myself.
4,Beanie Spotty dog,"This dog is a cute beanie baby type dog, perfect for an accompaniment to the Spotty Dog card game that I bought. My little 3 year old granddaughter loves dogs so should be happy with it."
2,Careful in the Dishwasher,"These measuring spoons were not very durable and actually became mishapen in the dishwasher. The magnets did not hold them together very securely, thereby defeating the purpose of having magnetized measuring spoons."
2,the runs,The dogs loved these treats but they gave my GSD the runs. So no more for him! I don't know if it's the ingredients or if the pup just has a sensitive stomach. So far these and mellow mut cause issues.
5,Anagram Singles Collection.,"This is a great album. It shows the more Rock N'Roll side of The Meteors, a CCR cover, a Ramones Cover, a MOTORHEAD cover, a Beach Boys cover, and 14 absolutely awesome psychobilly originals. I love it!"
5,"Awsome, one of my favorite books of all time!!",I can't say enough good things about this book. It goes to the very heart of a meaningful life.
2,not much info on cornrowing,"This dvd shows up close finger and hand positions,does not explain finger and hand positions,but does explain that when cornrowing all the 3 strands will get their turn to be in middle,but this dvd does not mention that when cornrowing you have to keep your hands and the hair down close to the scalp,and after parting the hair make 3 small strands with the index finger and thumb."
3,GOOD TO LEARN HOW TO DO BASIC NATURAL CORNROLLS,THIS DVD SHOWS HOW TO DO BASIC STRAIGHT BACK CORNROLLS ON NATURAL HAIR. DO NOT GET THIS DVD IF YOUR LOOKING TO LEARN HOW TO DO CORNROLLS WITH WEAVE ADDED. BUT THIS DVD SHOWS HOW TO DO VERY NEAT PROFESSIONAL NATURAL CORNROLLS. IT TELL YOU WHAT TOOLS YOU WILL NEDED ALSO
4,Awsome Video!,This video is a step above the rest. I've been a customer of Braids by Breslin for a while. Go to the web site if you can. This video and all of her others will not let you down. They even offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you don't like it... get your money back.
4,Stream machine,My daughter and her friends have had hours of fun with the stream machines. They are very happy with them. No complaints.
5,Chicken Defense,"This is an excellent tool for training my neighbors' chickens to stay clear from my garden!! The course launches again for baby chicks and some take longer to ""get it"" -- but it works better than anything I've tried. Save fence money and enjoy the sport w/o harming any animals."
4,Shoots well but dribbles a lot,"Stream Machine 24-Inch Water Launcher, Colors May VaryThis squirt gun is very simple. You put it point down in a bucket of water, pull back the plunger, aim and shoot. It would be a lot of fun outside or at the beach. However, it does tend to drip out all the water before you get a chance to shoot, so I can't give it top marks. I don't have experience with other super squirt guns, so I don't know if that is common to others."
1,Water Sports Stream Machine,"This is useful only if you have a swimming pool. I thought it would be like a squirt gun that I could aim at invading dogs chasing my cats. Not a chance. It's basically a plastic tube inside a plastic tube that sucks up water and expels it in a single, garden-hose-like stream. It was not something that met my needs. It's probably indestructible though."
1,Never worked,"I purchased this product since it is compatible with the boat buddy. However, the first time I took it out to use it, it broke in several places. The handle fell off and the inner plastic tube snapped into two pieces. The stream machine did not work long enough to release so much as a single decent stream. This toy is not worth any money. Unfortunately, I bought this product before it was warm enough to use it, so by the time I tried it out I was no longer able to return it to Amazon. Now I (and/or my trash can) is stuck with this worthless piece of plastic."
2,Water fights,"We purchased a few water guns this year for the kids and found that we were being shot at all the time with only the hose to defend ourselves. We brought the stream machine thinking it would be the answer and it was for 3 days and then parts started to fall of, the glue they used isn't waterproof. We took it apart and re-glued with suitable glue. It now works great."
5,It goes the distancw,Actually bought the water launcher to scare the neighbors cats away from our many bird feeders; this thing really works and it does it without harming the animals. We needed something that would go over 50 ft and this toy does the job.
2,Does NOT shoot very far!,"I got this for my Dad because he likes to shoot geckos off his screened porch (don't worry - this isn't strong enough to do a thing other than scare them). It really doesn't shoot even close to as far as what it advertises and it just putters out at the end of the stream. I'd say, max, it will go 20 feet and it just goes in an arc, not a steady, straight stream. I had high hopes that this would get the job done and it definitely does NOT. Only fun for shooting each other in the pool, basically. But be careful - You'll shoot your eye out! :)"
5,A Wonderful Commentary on the Book of Daniel,"This book is a terrific commentary on the book of Daniel with great illustrations and insightful, biblical teaching from the text. A must read. Definitely the best commentary on Daniel I have found. By the way, I had Dr. Renald Showers as a professor and he is a humble yet knowledgeable, biblical scholar."
4,An intelligent and melancholic Finnish poet,"The trilogy represents the last and best of Saarikoski's output, just before his death, and is one of the rare bits available in English. The trilogy contains his long poems, broken into sections, that combine a northern European sensibility (joy for the green blades of grass and despair at the burdensome winter just ahead) with his love for Greek mythology, gnosticism, and the Greek New Testament.One can find a taste of Saarikoski's poetry in the Vintage Book of Contemporary World Poetry. His writing is clever but always accessible."
4,"""Feel how cold I am""","Kelly Clarkson really came into her own as a songwriter on this album. She wrote/co wrote more songs on this album than her others. If you are expecting any light, fluffy songs...this is NOT you cd. It have more of an edge to it. It pushes more towards rock than the previous. The only song that I thought was ok but could've been better was Yeah...I felt that any 1st grader could have wrote it lyric wise. My favorites are..Chivas, Irvine, Be Still, Haunted, and Sober. Sober is a breath of fresh air. Her voice hits it perfectly. Sad that it haven't been a radio fixture."
3,Hmmmm...,"I knew what I was getting into when I bought this CD...LOTS of anger girl stuff. So it was no surprise when I opened it and played it for the first time. The problem is that the music is SO raw that it wears on my nerves. The guitars rail on nearly every song, and the way her voice is mixed leaves me feeling like I need a Valium... And I LIKE harder rock tunes. I bought it because it was a Kelly Clarkson CD and I love her music. Unfortunately, I don't love this collection. I do however think that ""Maybe"" is a terrific tune...more like the Kelly I've come to admire over the years. Perhaps her alliance with Reba McIntyre will produce some more listen-able tunes on her next album."
4,ying or yang,"By the 200+ reviews here, one thing is obvious.You either love it or hate it. You get it or you don't.That's the beauty of artistry, only here it's all in the ear of the listener.If you want pop, dance, catchy tunes forget it.If you want something to make you think and feel, this is for you.Me? I think I like it."
3,disappointing but not horrible,"First of all, I am a Kelly Clarkson fan but I was disappointed with this album. Every song has the same message: Bad break up, girl gets stronger and finds some strength from the break up. I could have taken a couple with this theme but every song? There had to be more going on in her life than this in the past couple of years. While there are some highlights, most lack strong melodies that KC fans look for. With that said, if this were a brand new artist it would not have been so disappointing so I am not saying it is horrible, just expected more from her. This cd is entertaining but will not get the constant rotation on my ipod that the last one got.While I applaud her desire to be creative there are times in your life when you should respect others feeback. I really hope that her next album is not 13 songs all about this bad experience."
3,kelly clarson-my december,"i have every album kelly clarson has ever brought out and i must say and i am sorry to say this but this is not one of her better albums.but like my dad said,who has been listening to music for over 54 years that once in a while a recording artist will bring out an album that just does not live up to par with their previous albums.he even said the beatles have done that case in point the album ""let it be"".if people who are fans want to buy it or anyone else wants to buy it fine if they don't that's fine too.like i said it isn't one of her best albums.sincerly chrisfan."
5,The Best Kelly Clarkson Yet!!!,I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of My December. After hearing all about Kelly's struggles to get this cd made I will admit I was a little worried. After listening I believe it his her best work yet!! The songs seem to reflect a lot of emotion. All the tracks are great! My favorite is Irvine. I hope the sales can show the record execs that Kelly knows what she is doing. Buy this cd!
5,Amazon is messed up on the number of reviews and rating,"At one point until last week, Amazon had over 350 reviews listed with a 4 star average. What happened? The album is great. Original, edgy, different from the vanilla junk that's out there today. The only thing that stopped sales on this album from being outstanding was the inexplicable refusal by the label to help promote the album."
1,Very dissappointed!,I was very dissappointed in Kelly Clarkson's new album. I loved her last album from the first to the last song so I was very suprised at how bad this one is. It has a very different sound that I just don't like very much. Its just my personal opinion but at least I understand now why she was fighting with her managers over this one!
1,Long anticipated... huge disappointment,"I am a huge Kelly Clarkson fan, and have been looking forward to the release of her new album for several years now. Boy, was I disappointed. The new album is a completely different style than her last two... and by different, I mean, it sucks. I ran out and bought this album the day it came out, took it home, listened to it, and slowly lost hope that there was one good song on the album as each track played. It seems as if Kelly is trying to take on the image of hard-core rock girl... and it just isn't her. While this style works for female artists such as Pink and Amy Lee of Evanescence, Kelly needs to stick to her roots. Being a pop artist is what she is good at, and the so-called rock music was a bad choice. Let's hope that Kelly goes back to singing the music she's good at for her next album."
1,Why so down Kelly??? Why all the sadness??? Why hate???,"I really like Kelly, loved her cd Breakaway! This new cd, is so depressing. I hope Kelly is allright. I know she wanted to do her own thing and got her way, looks like getting your way isn't always the best thing I guess. Her voice is good, but the songs are sad and negative. After listening I found myself to be depressed. I don't buy a cd to be depressed. Sadly I don't recommend this cd and to be honest I don't even want my daughter to listen to it. Whats with all the hate in Never Again. Just a horrible song. Sorry Kelly, but I bet your next cd will be awesome, please try some uplifting songs! 1 star"
1,AWFUL!!,This is awful. What a waste of money and time and everything else...especially Kelly's voice.
2,BON JOVI IS THE BEST,EVERYONE READING THIS GO AND BUY BON JOVI'S NEW ALBUM LOST HIGHWAY ITS GREAT!!!! dONT HAVE THE KELLY CLARKSON ALBUM BUT IM JUDGING FROM THE FIRST SINGLE.
1,It's because she's a WOMAN...,"Kelly needs to wake up and smell the man.This album blows. Or, sucks. Depending on your feminism.And, not because she's a WOMAN...even though she insists on blaming all her failures on such a RIDICULOUS argument.The GENDER card is JUST as CHEEZY and LAME of an excuse as the RACE card!""The man"" wasn't trying to stick it to you just because you are a woman (um, I mean a girl...as evidenced by the pulling of the gender card). He was trying to stick it to you because the producers and label execs want to make MONEY. You made them MILLIONS by recording trite radio pop. THEY WANT THIS SUCCESS AGAIN. It has NOTHING to do with you being a ""woman."" It has EVERYTHING to do with MAKING MONEY. They want instant hits. They don't want some syrupy ""oh I've been done so wrong"" uncatchy unoriginal crap. Bottom line is MONEY. NOT what hangs between your legs. Idiot.Oh...Alanis and Benetar called. They want their style back.Never again."
3,"not as good as Breakaway, but there are some great tracks","It would be difficult for her to top Breakaway, which was one of my favorite albums of the decade, the title track, especially. I generally prefer her softer songs, though I think it's good that she's trying to break out of the American Idol mold and write her own songs. This album is very honest, though a bit angry, and her voice is sounding as good as ever. Out of the rock songs, ""Judas"" is the most radio-friendly, and ""Never Again"" is steadily growing on me. But I think she should have tried ""Be Still"" as the first single, a real standout acoustic ballad, and ""Irvine"" is great, on that one her vocals remind me a bit of Dusty Springfield, and she's one of the few singers that can effortlessly swing between country, rock, R&B and pop ballads. This album deserves a shot to succeed in its own right indepedently of ""Breakaway"" but it will take some getting used to."
5,Don't just listen one time.,"This is a great cd, but don't listen one time and make your judgement. This CD will grow and you and you will not be able to get enough of it."
3,"I love Kelly, but...","you know, I was really anticipating this album. I love Kelly, her girl power, her voice, her style, her sas, etc. i liked Never Again and Sober, and such. This is a little unfinished, and I think she knows it (and possibly couldn't help it).her voice a bit flat at times, the songs a little under-produced, but a couple good ones in there..."
2,waste of money,"I don't like this cd at all. I've liked Kelly Clarkson since the beginning, but I never bought an album of hers until recently. I bought her debut album, and liked it so much, I ordered this one and was so excited when it came in. But it's just a bunch of metal and yelling. I still listen to ""Thankful"" all the time, but ""My December"" I haven't touched since I first heard it. I was dissappointed; I had such high hopes."
3,Good,"Kelly is such a talented and beautiful girl. This album is good, but not her best. I think she sounds like she is screaming alot and many of the songs sound the same. It's a sad album - maybe she needed to get some things off her mind?"
3,Little bit of a let-down,"I am a big Kelly Clarkson fan, however, I found the CD overall to be somewhat understated. There are a few good tunes, but I don't think this will be a big seller. I wanted to love it, unfortunately, it was just an okay CD. I hope the next one will be better."
5,My December is a hit!,"Much has been made of Kelly Clarkson's change of direction on her third album. The heavier tracks and darker themes are surprisingly effective. With a hard-fought songwriting credit on every track, this is pure Clarkson. By laying her soul bare on relationships, suicide, betrayal and more, My December evokes memories of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill. It is the album Clarkson had to make and establishes her as an all-round package and musical force to be reckoned with. - JAMES WIGNEYBEST BIT: Clarkson's versatility and ability to convincingly turn that extraordinary voice to a wide range of styles.WORST BIT: It may disappoint old fans.VERDICT: Five stars"
5,My December.,"I love Kelly, and I loved her albums before listening to this one because I bought CD's by Kelly years before, right here on Amazon, and although this album is not better than ""Breakaway"", my favorite Kelly album, it is just as good. Every single song on this album is PERFECT. Nuff said."
2,Very Disapointed,"I'm very disapointed by this cd. I first heard Kelly on the dvd of The princess diaries 2 and bought her album Breakaway soon after. Now that is an amazing album. So I thought I should give this one a try and wow, I was surprised at how bad it was. Overall I only like 2 songs on this cd. I think the main thought I had while listening to it was: It's not because you can sing loud that you need to do it constantly."
1,My December/Kelly Clarkson,"Too much, Too fast!This one lacks the vibrancy and emotion her priors exhibited. Rushed?NOT impressed at all."
1,Awful,"I have never seen American Idol, but I enjoyed Kelly's first few songs on the radio. Her second album was excellent. This one was horrible and I have returned it."
3,NOT BAD..BUT NO BREAKAWAY,"Let me first say, I was totally into Clarkson's previous album Breakaway, it rocked from start to finish, and granted i didnt think she could follow it up with a better album, but i really expected a stronger showing than this pretty good CD, I've read all the drama in its making and the fact that Clive Davis is going to sink this CD, and if you've noticed how little airplay the first single is getting you know that this is true, it's the best song on the CD and it's hardly been noticed by radio..should be an interesting summer for Kelly, her tour scrapped by Davis and she in his dog house...but im sure she will end up fine and im betting her next album is her best yet...as for this one..i think Kelly rocks, so ill give her a break and hope her next album is a BREAKAWAY."
1,Not the best...,"I bought this album with great expectations since Kelly's career has been so successful over the past few years. Her debut album ""Thankful"" and her second Album ""Breakaway"" were nothing less than amazing... however, ""My December"" is , in my opinion, definitely not one of her finer artistic compilations. The music drowns out her lyrics so much that you can barely make out what she's singing about. Add to the fact that every song is so angry that her talented vocal skills are not showcased in the least on this album, leaving much to be desired after being blown away by her beautiful ballads on her past albums. I was pretty disappointed with this album... in fact, I only listened to it once through and it's been sitting under my carseat untouched for the past 6 weeks."
5,awesome,"Finally, Kelly gets to break free and express herself. I have rooted for her since A.I.season 1, Saw her win live season one ect. She's got a hot new albumn showing the real Kelly , not some random label hitmaker. I have been waiting for Kelly to finally get to express herself and I rate the new CD A 10 out of 10. She's got some control, and definetly the talent. I hope the fans won't give up on her. Her talent is endless. Ca guy here, Kelly Lover, Peace Out!! Keep her on the hot list, where she belongs!!!"
5,Great Third Album,"Kelly Clarkson's third CD My December has blown away all the doubts I had after hearing all the negative press surrounding it. The CD surprised me in a lot of ways and has replaced Breakaway as my favorite Kelly CD. Whereas it may not spawn 8 number one singles like a factory, it does have songs that are moving and well-written by Clarkson. My favorite songs on the album would have to be Be Still and Maybe. Although I listen to the entire CD on repeat these two stand out the most for me. I love them, love the CD, love Kelly. This CD is definitely worth buying and listening to even if you are upset because Kelly stood strong and went against being another hit single machine. This album rocks my world."
4,Not a teen pop star any longer!!!,"Kelly's new CD is definitely not a retread of ""Break Away,"" and the teenage pop songs are totally MIA on the new disc. Therein lies the biggest problem with the disc: It is just not a very enjoyable listen. There are no light and breezy sing-along-songs to be found, and the artist's anger, depression, and bitterness cuts through every track with a vengeance that has the potential to suck the life out of the listener. THAT SAID... this CD is VERY, VERY, VERY WELL DONE. It is absolutely top-knotch as far as artisty goes and probably deserves FIVE STARS in that regard. I believe fans will either love this disc or absolutely hate it, and Kelly stands to both lose a lot of loyal fans who have enjoyed her earlier recordings and to gain new ones who like the edgier, more mature Clarkson. I repeat: it is EXCELLENT, yet DIFFERENT..."
5,GREAT CD - MUST HAVE!!!!,"I received my CD just two days ago and at first only liked a few songs, NA, SOBER and IRVINE. After several listens, I realized just how great this CD is - the songs stay in head and I must say I like just about every song on the CD. KC, please come to New Orleans on your next tour. Do youself a favor, pick up a copy and give it several listens - you will absolutely love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,My December Review,I love Kelly Clarkson. I watched her through the show. I love this album. It is personal and fits her to the tee. You also get to hear her sing different ranges that you don't normal hear. I think she is a great singer and will go a long way. I will continue to buy her music.
2,Never Again is the only winner,"I was really looking forward to this new cd as a Kelly Clarkson fan but unfortunately the only really good song was the 1st one ""Never Again"". It's a bit more rock than her usual style and I really like it but the rest of the cd bounces between disco, and sort of folk rock. It's uncentered and now I understand why the record company didn't want to release it."
4,"Kelly's in a different ""light""","Despite the negative feedback from her producer, I enjoy listening to her voice on this CD. Some of the songs are more ""rocky"" than her usual style BUT... this is great music!"
5,A big angsty pot of wonderful.,"In spite of the controversy, which will almost destroy any unbiased or otherwise neutral parties (or skew peoples' opinions far too much in a positive direction as a show of support for Kelly or in a negative direction as a show of derision), I personally think this is an awesome album, filled with thrashing rock numbers (Haunted), dark 80's anthems of ebtrayal that call up Pat Benatar (Judas), gorgeously blossoming ballads (the gorgeous Sober and haunting Irvine), swaggering blues cuts (like the sexy, swaying Yeah) and writhing, energetic streaks of music like One Minute or How I Feel, as well as a touch of coutnry-rock (the misty, lovely Can I Have A Kiss?).Kelly's vocals are in top form, raw and emotional, and the lyrics are oftentimes dark, depressing, and sad, but every so often she picks the mood up a bit.You can find the full review by me at [...]"
3,Unphased,"My December was a bit of a disappointment to me. There were two tracks that I liked, and the others were over produced. This seems to happen...the innocence, and raw talent is replaced by what is perceived the public desires."
3,I'd rather have me some Kelly,".. Then any more sugary pop tarts and their fakery attempts to stardom. Kelly's talent is something worthy of my appreciation. Her previous effort, ""breakaway"" was an absolutely great fun catchy pop record that showcased her strong potent voice. This album enforces the ideaology that Kelly can sing but cannot surface to a pleasing area of astonishment. Most of the songs are slow and tepid and somewhat depressing. Never again is absolutely great but very memorable; Hole is tiring and not very catchy as are alot of the songs.. I have hope in her future effort's (lyrical) outcome since with this album, she was under extreme artistic and commercial pressure to deliver."
5,Heartfelt Performances by Kelly Clarkson,"This is a very intense CD by Kelly. She co-wrote all of the songs. I think the vocal performances are amazing - you truly feel the emotion she's portraying - and that's what makes a true artist. The last song on the CD is really beautiful - it made me cry - if you want to hear some real artistry, you'll love this CD - it's not one to make you happy - but is one to listen to if you want to know what singing is all about - having the listener feel what the singer is feeling. Beautiful job, Kelly. I really hope, though, that you're happier in real life!"
5,More Rock Less Pop......,Kellys' voice on this cd reminds me of the raw edge associated with Alanis in her Jagged Little Pill release. This cd is much different than her first. It sounds like it comes from a womans heart instead of a teen pop singer. I just love the emotionally charged tunes. Her voice is so expressive and true. My favorite song is the little bonus at the end of the cd with just her voice and a guitar.
1,don't like lyrical content,"I'm a casual fan of Kelly Clarkson. I enjoyed a few songs by her, which I downloaded from iTunes (A Moment Like This/Before Your Love single and Breakaway single). She has a wonderful voice but I'm not too thrilled about her latest album, My December. I don't like the bitter, dark, depressing lyrics of the songs on this album."
2,My December CD by Kelly Clarkson,"Certainly not her best work. I was surprised this was the music style she had longed to do and was warned against. For those who want more rock it probably would be a good choice. I just don't see Kelly in chains & tattoos. She can sing anything well, and I understand her desire to change things up to break away from the hometown girl image. She can change, but must keep the solid pop coming or risk losing those fans who voted for her and the great style music we picked her for."
3,COuld have been better,"Not as good as her last cd, but still has a few tracks that are worth a listen."
2,As Good As Her Other Ones....,"This album is on track with all the other Kelly Clarkson albums....average. She has a nice voice, but her songs always seem to lack something. This album has a angery tone, but it seems very plastic anger. I don't feel that it's real anger. She's seems to be making bland music. No hooks, no beat, no emotion....nothing. But than again, every Kelly album has been like that....Key Tracks: Yeah, Hole, and Judis"
1,SHOULD OF DELAYED IT,"This is by no means a review to bash Kelly Clarkson. I enjoy her music and I even have some of it on my MP3 for running but this CD has only one hit NEVER AGAIN on it, which has already ran it course peaking at number 8 on billboard. The CD is a lot of rock and roll and the ballads are extremely weak. I will say it will enter the TOP 10 in Billboard but not number 1. I also think it will drop very quickly. The cover does not match what is inside. The cover would be more appropriate for her first CD Thankful. The songs inside have a more harder, aggressive sound and the cover should of reflected that. Hopefully after this CD is forgotten she will come back with a much better and powerful CD. This is not it."
2,Not My Style,"Fiest off I consider myself a Kelly Clarkson fan. But.... I also know what I like and what I don't like and this cd is more like therepy for Kelly than anything musically coherent. No real rhyme or melody. And after listening to her yell out so many of the songs I want to rip my ears out. I'm sorry, just my opinion. I know other fans would love her if she stood there and whistled."
1,Clive was right!!,Kelly is ruining her voice and she is not a song writer. Really bad but it will do well with her fans buying multiple copies.
3,Good but not Great,This is good but not as great as Breakaway. I love Kelly Clarkson though. She is a naturally tallented singer. I suggest that she concentrate on the type of songs she is adept in. She can sing inserts if she wishes. By this I mean she can do the way Michael Jackson does. He is a pop singer but in his CD he can sing rock or R&B.
