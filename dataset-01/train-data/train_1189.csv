4,Chefs Companion,"We work in restaurants and as soon as I bought one of these books the other chefs also wanted one, so now I have bought 5 so far. Great price too."
2,Not so great,"Thagard's book is little more than an extremely superficial skim of and introduction to cognitive science. I know that the book is supposed to be a simple introduction, but in many ways it is far to simplistic and glossed over. There are many times at which he introduces new terms and concepts without defining them. He also jumps around quite a bit. His examples are very short and do not provide much insight beyond the obvious. Unless you need the book for class, I would avoid it. If you are just looking for an informative introduction to cognitive science, this is not the book for you."
4,Useful book for Cognitive Sciences' students,"Very good book regarding the Computational Representational Understanding of Mind (CRUM). Althought only focusing on one theory to explain the fucntioning of our mind it has concise and easy to understand explanations, going from the most basic representations to the most complex."
1,What In The Hell Are They Thinking???,"Being a Professional Massage Therapist, I find this laughable... Yes it's about Erotic Massage... However it lacks ANY of the basics which you simply have to know. You'll be fumbling aroung like a fool and embarrassing yourself trying this without some decent training. Now on the other hand, if you want to learn how to give a so-so ""genitalia job"", then spend your 20 odd some bucks for this waste. It's noting you can't figure out with a loving partner, and alot more fun than, watch- try to imitate, rinse-repeat, and still get nowhere with this.These videos prey on people trying to learn... research the net for free... you'll find wealth of ibfo... these videos really and quite wrongfully offer for you NOTHING... in my opinion."
4,Tastefully Rendered,"This was an interesting guide. Visually stimulating, educational. Erotic and explicit without being vulgar. Offered good massage techniques. Will recommend to others."
1,Oh my god,"Biggest waste of money ever. Boring, it reminded me of those old sex ed movies. Don't bother. I fell asleep watching it."
2,Basically the same old stuff.,"The Jesus Seminar and Robert Funk continues the same old story of recreating Jesus in any way that they can to remove him from the religious world. Their intellectual dishonesty is smeared across the pages to expose their real agenda - convince you that Jesus was nothing more than a sage and try to convince you that Jesus, God and religious standards are foolish and restrictive."
1,Questionable methods!,"Starting from the premise that what is recorded in the bible as the quoted words and deeds of Jesus may not be accurately reported, is a significant problem with this work. Mr. Funk, et al., seem to approach the NT biblical accounts from a negative starting point, content with attempting to disprove rather than prove its content under the guise of serious academic considerations. In addition, the ""scholars"" cited as part of this work are of minor biblical scholarship consequence and the method of ""scholarly agreement by consensus"" employed by Mr. Funk and the rest is of very questionable note."
1,"Lack of Scholarship, Presence of Agenda!","As the founder of the Jesus Seminar, Bob Funk is not only one of, but the leader of this extremely biased and under-qualified group of ""scholars."" This book is one in a series written by the Jesus Seminar to systematically disassemble the authenticity and historocity of the gospels and Acts. The denial of miracles, Christ's deity, Christ's resurrection, and the validity of scripture as a whole are central to the Seminars agenda. Beware of this book and the Jesus Seminar."
5,"Super warm, but sheds a little","Here in Chicago, this purchase was primarily for function, over fashion. Bought it for my husband who has a shaved head & needs something warm for the winter months. He raves that it's the warmest hat he's ever had.The inside of the hat does not have rabbit fur all over, but is the same lining as the outside & is stuffed with down. The rabbit fur that is on the frame of the hat is VERY soft, but the only downside is that it sheds a little. Hopefully it'll stop shedding after a while.If you don't want the ear/chin coverage all the time, you can easily clip the side flaps over your head."
2,"Not a handbook, not about Web servers","This is a classic puff piece of a book. There is very little real, practical information provided. Most of the material has little or nothing to do about Mac OS X specifically, and the little there is will not prove helpful, except to provide the most basic overview of Mac OS X. The only people who should buy this book would be those who are not very conversant with even the basics of the Internet. For example, if you need an entire chapter devoted to Web _browsers_, then buy this book. The only redeeming feature about this book is that the writing is not too bad, for a technical book, but the marketing is downright deceptive. This book is not a handbook, and contains material that only tangentially concerns Mac OS X, to no practical good effect."
3,Mac OS X Web Server Handbook - the web server part..,"I picked up this book, because as you can probably guess.. I am planning on running the Apache Server so I can develop web applications and test them on my local machine. Either I misread the back, or I thought this book was going to teach me everything about setting up and developing on a web server.. however the author tends to just glide over the good stuff and spend oodles of time telling you about the millions of things you can add to your server, but fails to go into any real detail on anything. Oh well, live and learn."
1,Photoflex Connector for Elinchrome,The product does not fit well and it does not attach or un-attach without a lot of pushing and expletives (swear words). Elinchrome makes a great product and I wanted the ability to attach some of my other brand softboxes to the Elinchrome heads. The photoflex connectors are just barely adequate. Poorly designed product. Buy another connector if you have Elinchrome heads.Steve B.
4,A Worthwhile Read,"Upon the recommendation of a friend, I read The Farming Bones and thoroughly enjoyed it. The author's style of writing was almost poetic and made for a light flow, despite the seriousness of the turmoil the characters face and the time period in which the book is set in. I was carried into Amabelle's world and found myself crying during her most tragic moments and yet hopeful just as she was despite the circumstances she was in. At times the main character seemed to just float through moments in her life, not really seeming to be there as anything more than an observer, however, I took that to be a part of how she dealt with the realities around her, sort of a survival mechanism. There were moments I wished the book would pick up pace, but also found that the slowness of the book added to the charm and overall effect of the book."
2,"Not Bad, But Lacks Depth, 2.5 Stars","This book really wants to be literary fiction, but it lacks the necessary warmth and depth. The characters are flat and underdeveloped, such that it's hard to feel sorrow for their suffering. The only way I could work up any kind of caring was to remind myself that these characters had real-life counterparts who did in fact suffer the atrocities inflicted by Trujillo.The author seems to assume a lot of prior knowledge on the part of the reader about the events portrayed. The information provided is seriously inadequate. I'm still not really sure exactly what happened, except that Generalissimo Trujillo ordered the large-scale slaughter of Haitian immigrant workers in the Dominican Republic in 1937.An easy enough read, and I wouldn't say it's terrible. Just oversimplified and unsatisfying."
2,A let-down after her 2 previous works.,A bit of a struggle to read. She pulls you in with the escape scenes and the massacres and then seems to bore you with the minutae in beetween.

4,The most riviting novel on Haiti that I have read. I wept.,"Danticat's novel is one of the most riviting works I have read. She situates the lives of the two Haitian women characters (mother and daughter) within the context of contemporary political events in Haiti and the United States. She discusses women's issues in a powerful and moving way. The text also shows insight into the daily lives of many Haitian women immigrants, and the legacy of culture, history, oppression, beauty, and strength that they bear."
3,"Wonderful characters, intense environment, weak storytelling","I wanted to like this book a lot more than I did, because it introduced me to a world I didn't know and showed me it thorugh a character that I had not seen before. Yet the overly formal poetic language distanced me from her plight. I was never truly moved by what was happening because it rarely felt like it was actually happening to a real person. What I did like was the writer's guts in telling basically a day to day tale and then, about 3/4 of the way through, hitting the fast forward button. Lesser writers would not have been able to pull this off."
4,Refreshing,"I looked forward to reading this book each evening, and finished it in only a few nights. I enjoyed Danticat's simple prose. She tells the story of the Haitian slaughter through the eyes of a servant working in the DR. For a new author I found her technique of different voices -- the telling of the present story and the reflections on the main character's inner voice -- daring. And it worked. I look forward to more from Danticat."
4,Classic comedy,Basic plot bunch of guys trying to score...women trying to get one friend to brake out of her shell..it's one of those movies good for a rainy day it had its ups and downs but its worth a watch...
5,Must have!,Prefect ! The length was exactly what I needed. A little stiff until it is out in the sun for a few hours.
3,"Good theme, too many facts","I was assigned this book for AP U.S. History class and was excited to read a book that focused on the point of view of a loyalist during the pre-revolutionary era instead of the typical rebel point of view that we've studied in the past. I reccommend this book to anyone who likes alternative points of view on possibly controversial subjects. The only drawback, the reason I did not give it four or five stars, is that it gives a lot of facts from the era like specific act names. I don't deem these things important when trying to understand where a loyalist in this area is coming from."
2,Did not inpire me to pick up my guitar,"Al's albums as of late are great musical masterpieces, but I'm not moved to learn the songs like I am on the older stuff, like Kiss My Axe. I would put this CD on if I needed to get to sleep. I found a few intense moments, but overall this ones a little slow for me."
4,tyical al...just cruising along,"a notch down from his last cd, though i still find al to be the greatest living guitar player today (except for les paul). i wish he could come up with something to rival ""kiss my axe""... truly his best effort to date."
3,Too many things,"Some could say this work of Al is mature, so there's an evolution, etc.I met Al's music when I made a 'blind buy' in a record store, the LP was sealed. That LP was 'Elegant Gipsy', in my opinion the best of Al.In 'The Infinite Desire' there are too many things, a plethora of instruments. I really don't understand where Al was going to when he recorded this material. I'm not looking for fusion or jazz. I'm just looking for guitar, I mean Al's guitar, maybe the old way, but not an experiment hard to listen to."
3,Silverline rocks !,"RE the previous review: I have several Silverline DVD-Audio releases, including the 3 Tchaikovsky ballets, Classical Crooners, Classical Country, and so on. They all are terrific recordings, even the old recordings which sound great in surround sound, and just as good as the only two pure DVD-Audio discs I have which won't play on my Sony SACD 400 disc changer as do the DTS."
3,Too close to Enigma for comfort,"Or at least this is what the album sounds to me. By no means a bad album, it still fails to impress me in ways that other world musicians do. Maybe it's the fact that it lacks the personality music from other artists like Banco de Gaia or Shpongle have. I agree it is a good mix of different music from all over the world, but it seems to me that the main point was lost in the mix somewhere along the way. It is the kind of music that is good to play while you're going around the house doing your things and not paying much attention to it. Anyhow, it does not grip you even if what you are doing is just listening to it, so soft that I find it hard to focus on what's going on. If you want music to relax on, you should go for it, but if you look for something more involving you should look elsewhere."
3,Beware signing up for free 3 months online,"They will automatically bill you for $179 after three months, with no warning and no easy way to cancel it. Especially kids and teens who sign up with parent's credit card (required)--beware!!"
3,WARNING to LDS members considering this product,"The product arrived yesterday, earlier than expected. This new 2006 version has a lot of great features. I like the way it will search automatically [...] It will also search out how many people with that surname served in the Civil War (USA) and for which ""side"".The software developers planned very poorly when designing the LDS Ordinance facts. It does not have the SEAL TO SPOUSE ordinance built in to the program. That means, all the marriage sealings you have already completed must be inputted manually, one by one. That is a needless, extremely time-consuming process for those who have completed a lot of ordinance work and have already entered it into their previous databases.I had no problems at all installing the software and importing the GedCom disk from my previous genealogy software. When I discovered the marriage sealings did not transfer over to the FTM 2006 product, I was certainly not a ""happy camper""."
4,Complex proram,"I find it difficult to get from one place to another. I have not been able to enter all the information I would like to enter. For instance: A person married more than once. I suspect an experienced genealogist would find it easier to use. As far as I know, this is the best program on the market."
2,"Works, but you'd better be computer savvy","I don't know why Family Treemaker makes completely useless instruction manuals, but they do. Once you master the software (or, actually, the small portion of the software that is readily accessible to the non-professional), it works as advertised. But the learning curve is steep, and I wish that all the bells and whistles they say are in the software would be explained so that this genealogist could actually use them. Not user friendly!"
3,Not All It is Cracked Up to Be,"I received Family Tree Maker 2006, Deluxe version, for Christmas. I had used two earlier versions of FTM and had been very happy, updating and spending more money to do so. 2006 software offers a free trial of Ancestry.com for one year.However,I can't get to the free offer from my installation software-as I was instructed to do. I have written to the company at several of its addresses, asking them to e-mail me concerning the problem. After two months, I still have no answer. It is like I have been ignored.I can only consider this another form of false advertising on the part of both Family Tree Make and Ancestry!"
4,Great behind the scenes look at MMA's rise,"If you are a fan of MMA (mixed martial arts) and want to know how the sport got to where it is today, you will find this book engrossing. When the sport first started, it faced legal and financial obstacles at every turn. Many legislators wanted to ban it as ""human cockfighting."" The early promoters had to deal with technical glitches, unpredictable (outside the cage) fighters, corrupt government officials, even crime syndicate interference. When you know more of the story, you have to admire the folks who persevered through all that to get the sport to where it is now. It is a story rich with interesting characters, grudges, betrayals, and also honor and some humor. The writing is clear. The amount of inside information is surprising. If you are interested in the business side of this sport, you will definitely enjoy this book."
3,Be careful about rentals,"Be careful. This rental was only available to me for 3 days - at least, that's what it says now, altho there is nothing in the order, or on the web page now, that says that. For all I know, they changed it after I rented it. I would print out the page of any rentals you do."
2,INSPIRATIONAL STORY! POORLY EXECUTED!,"This film is based on a heartbreaking true story, unfortunately the tragic story gets lost in this ultimately forgettable collection of uneven disjointed scenes that leave the viewer confused and unattached to the crisis at hand. While the actual story is well worth telling, it's poorly told in this so-so melodrama concoction. We are allowed no time to get to know the characters before the fatal crash and it takes us to the last 10 minutes before we have enough invested in this film to care. I've seen many better sports films that are heartfelt and leave you feeling inspired. I have to give this film some credit as it seems to get it right in the last 10 minutes, which is the only part of the movie that didn't feel forced. It's OK for a rental, but I wouldn't waste my time for a second viewing."
4,An Uplifting and Moving Movie,We Are Marshall is a great movie with fine performances all around. Matthew McConaughey does a fine job playing Jack Lengyel; the coach that takes over the program at Marshall University - after the tragic loss of almost the entire team and coaching staff after a plane crash. The football scenes are very well-done and the movie is emotionally stirring.
4,Well done reminder of a tragedy and triumph,"This is one of those movies you just have to see once to realize that life can move on after tragedy. This tells the story of The Thundering Herd of Marshall from Huntington West Virginia, and their horrific loss of 75 players/boosters/coaches at the end of the 1970 season. In 1971, with the bravery of the few remaining players, an incredible school president/dean, and one caring coach, the town was able to reserect the spirit of the town and the nation and in a leave a legacy for those who were left behind. Just think, since then they have won two 1-AA championships, then 5 strait bowl victories in the early 2000's after moving to 1-A. No one should be let down by this film."
4,overall pleased,the dvd was only a penny plus 2.95 s& h so you cant beat that it came with case and dvd played perfectly the only complaint is that the case was cracked when i got it
2,Not what I expected.,"I had anxiously waited for this to come out on dvd, and was really disappointed with it. It is an ok movie and I am glad I bought it but it wasn't really what I expected it to be."
2,"""This isn't about football...""","Yes it's a tragic story. No, it's not a horrible film. But at the end of the day, I can't recommend it. It does the same thing that countless other sports movies have done before it. The difference is that this one has almost no football in it. It's just scene after scene of townsfolk grieving. And McConaughey's cocked mouth is just wacky and distracting."
4,Surprised me,"Maybe I'm just too emotional lately, but this movie actually squeezed out a few tears. I don't quite buy McConaughey performance-he tends to be playing the same person to me in every movie. Just show up and flash the audience his tight body and deep dimples and we'll fall for his ""Aw shucks"" routine. What works is the director's ability to capture this town's deep loss and incredible heart. Even though the Marshalls don't get their baring for another decade, their never say die fight is encouraging and most of all touching."
4,Excellent...I have only one complaint really.,"The movie is wonderful. The other reviews will tell you so. I do not dispute it. This wide screen package was an excellent purchase. It is not jammed full of unnecessary stuff and sucker items to make you purchase it. Who needs commentary and other stuff for a film like this any way? lolMy only complaint about the movie -Whoever was in charge of editing or adding music to scenes went overboard. At times, you will hear maybe 7 different 'period' songs in the same amount of minutes!!!! Geeez, it is too much and takes away from the movie. I know they are trying to ""take you back"" to that time period and give you the feel. But it is too much. All the music is great! Really good selections. They just tried to jam to much music in. At times it felt like a Time/Warner infomercial for songs of the 70s!!!! lol"
4,This truth is more dramatic than any fiction,"I used to stay with my aunt and uncle in Huntington for many summers, then visited them many weekends while a student at UVa. The plane crashed just a few miles from their farm. Just a week earlier my uncle took me to a Marshall game in Huntington where they were playing Kent State. While some of the characters are composites (the cheerleader for one) I felt that it would be difficult for a movie to capture the mood of a town that just lost so many of it's prominent citizens. Just about everyone there knew someone who died - but this move captured that feeling and in a dignified manner. And it captures the long slow struggle back to getting a football team with coach Dawson. The movie is more than about a ""sports comeback"" - it is a story of the triumph of the human spirit.Matthew McConaighey has said that it is a movie that he took pride in making."
4,We are Marshall,"Good movie fast service, Thanks a bunch,I enjoyed it very much,---------- ----- -- -- ---- ---- -- -- ---- ii"
4,ANOTHER SPORTS DELIGHT,"Not being fully aware of the tragic lost of these young football players; I was captivated by the details. This movie is a good portrayal of how one sad event can change so many lives. Although the storyline attempts to display feelings of so many different people; within this realm you think of how you would react. The acting is good and evenly matched. There is no star; but a mixture of talented actors. The football games are well choreographed. There are many remarkable special effects. The theme keeps your interest and not one moment is wasted. This is a movie for sports lovers and one that has never seen a game. If you are a person you will join in when they shout ""We Are Marshall""."
3,We Are Marshall,"I liked the movie because it's a true story. I was a little disappointed, however, in Matthew McConahay(sp?)'s acting, and he is one of my favorites. Perhaps the coach he was playing actually had those mannerisms. Anyway, I would recommend it because it is a true story of triumphing over tragedy."
4,We R Marshall DVD,It was a gift as far as I know the product was good.....no comments were made from the recipient.
3,It's a guy flick or for a gal who loves football.,"I love Matthew McConnaughey but his role in this film was not up to my expectations. Again, I am not a sports girl and so the best parts were the poignancy of the loss of the team and how the few surviving members put forth their finest efforts. I just recently saw McConnaughey in Bernie and it was a fabulous film. McConnaughey played a slick Southern lawyer to perfection and the film was a true story just like We Are Marshall. It's just that Bernie was very well portrayed and flowed. The price, however, of this film was right and I do not regret seeing it. But I will give it to one of the kids as they love the boring sports. Sincerely, Dr. Carole"
5,AWESOME!,"I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I STILL HAVE MY HD DVD PLAYER.I RECEIVED IT, PLAYED IT AND LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT . I REALLY WISH HD DVD MOVIES WERE STILL MADE. GREAT HD DVD MOVIE.THUMBS UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,We Are Marshall,A great movie about life and how it effects people. Bringthem together to help each other find some peace andcomfort through such a tragedy.
4,Very heartwarming story,"I enjoyed this movie, it was well acted and well done. Not so much about sports as about community."
4,Great fact based story,"We Are Marshall is a well acted ""feel good/feel bad"" true story about a tragedy from 35 years ago. People connected to the event in any way have already enjoyed this film and will probably purchase the DVD to remember it by."
4,Get the tissues ready.,"We Are Marshall directed by McG is tearjerker from start to finish, sometimes the sentiment is layered on a little too thick but this movie is based on a true story so expect some sad and depressing moments. Matthew Fox and Matthew McConaughey are outstanding, they can do no wrong! The cinematography is striking and the story will just move you from scene to scene. I am not a huge fan of sports films but this one is quite good. We Are Marshall is uplifting even the tone of the film is generally meloncoholy. Good luck!"
4,Nicely done....,"Matthew McConaughey at his best. Not his usual studlike movie. A town struck into mourning by almost an entire football teams airplane crash. To re-cooperate a football coach is hired.The students get behind him when the faculty doesn't want to do a first season and he does a great job at pulling that first season, after the crash, together. Shows the contrast in the town and how they dealt with the pain. Some wanted their children to be remembered by not having them play the game again, some wanted the team to go on because they would have wanted them to. Others felt guilty because they weren't on the plane and got to go on living. Great movie..."
5,WE ARE,I love movies with cheesy inspirational pep talks. Stuff that makes your spine tingle. This movie has it. A good story that will take you on a emotional roller coaster.
4,Movie,Good inspirational movie for all ages. Would recommend it to a friend. Bought on Roku - quality was very good.
1,This is not a true story!,"I felt being tricked for reading this book. I found it in a local library. When I read the cover, it says "" the true story...."" So I thought that I will read it.The story is interesting and fun to read. However, after I finished the whole book, and turned to the last page, it has ""This book is a work of fiction.""well, if it is not true, why did you put it on the cover to make me think that I am actually reading a book about the real story of Atlantis?!Therefore, I gave it a rating of 1 star."
2,Disappointed,"The book was written by a Spurrier fan who told me nothing new about the great coach. It was 204 pages long and the author did not get to Spurrier's Florida coaching exploits until page 143. His legendary status as a coach BEGAN at Florida. Spurrier's Gator coaching accomplishments made him the star that he is today and I was hoping to get a detailed look at HOW he was so successful at Florida. I was left wanting SO much more. It was a good look at his younger days growing up and as a player in college and the NFL. It also explored his days as a small time college coach, but the contents regarding his tenure at Florida was rather pitiful. Still, a must read for any Gator or Spurrier fan, but not a real complete work. This, I hope, will NOT be considered THE definitive Spurrier biography when it is all said and done."
5,One of the best sports bios I've ever read,"With all the media buzz about this book, I was afraid it wouldn't live up to the hype, but I gotta admit that it's one very good book. Chastain really gets into the mind and heart of a remarkable and complex man."
3,Decent Sports Bio,"This book provides a decent if uninspired look at one of football's more interesting figures. High school star, Heisman trophy winner, modest pro, top college coach. Spurrier comes across as talented, decent, and fairly complex. The book focuses more heavily on his early life, from youth, to Heisman-winning quarterback, to disappointed pro. Fans expecting an indepth look at Spurrier's coaching accomplishments at Duke and Florida may find the information a bit thin. Nor is there all that much on his style of recruiting, game preparation, the game's mechanics, nor NCAA corruption. But there is a sense of the man and where he's been. This book was penned just as Spurrier took over as NFL coach in Washington, where he didn't have much success before returning to NCAA ranks. The book is readable and informative, but somehow I was left wanting more - and I'm not really a Spurrier fan, nor a fan of his teams."
4,The MK-660k is a fine tile saw,"The MK-660K tile saw is a beautiful machine. Not only in looks but also the way it cuts through tile like its butter. The saw sets up quickly and with the free folding stand makes any size job less effortless. This saw has many features the profesional or do-it-yourselfer will appreciate, from the removeable water reservoir, which makes clean up very easy. To the lightwieght of the unit which makes getting it to the jobsight easy. the reason I gave it 4 stars is because, when cutting 1/2 inch off of a 12 inch tile on the left hand side of the blade the tile runs into the frame that holds the motor."
1,Specs incorrect,"We returned the saw because the ad proported that it made a cut that was 2"" deep. The outside of the box read 1 1/2"" deep but the specs in the owners manual read 1 1/4"" deep. We returned the saw for the larger saw."
2,This saw IS NOT Professional,"Anyone who says it is, is not qualified to rate it. For the average home Improvement specialist I am sure it will be just fine. For ripping 6x6 tiles this might be the saw for you. I bought the protractor to cut angle tiles and when on the left side of the blade it works great. HOWEVER if you need to use the right side of the table the knob on top of the protractor hits the motor mount and prevents you from cutting tile. For an extra $90 buy the Mk100 and 2x the horse power a 10"" blade, free stand 14"" diagonal rip capacity and Much more motor clearance.Cons:Will not rip a 12"" tile DiagonallyWill bog down on some tilesThe accessories do not work well with the motor design."
4,A Great Sampler of Rev. James Cleveland,"This collection of Cleveland's best is a great way to get started developing a chronicle of the history of Gospel music. As a Gospel musician, I listen to the richness of the original Gospel charateristics and sink my teeth into the rich chord progressions and attempt to incorporate some of this artistic sytle of playing for it's historical value. This is a great collection and a fantastic way to start a collection on Traditional Gospel music."
2,Family Reunion Organizer,I think it will be nice once I get everything manually added. It would be a much better software if it had some kind of upload instead of manual entering everything. I have 300 families to enter. UGH!! Once I do all that I think it will be a wonderful resouce for planning a family reunion.
1,Vista Issues and Poor Technical Support,"This program can have some issues running with Windows Vista. The issue that I had came from the Windows help feature that has been changed with Vista.Be prepared if you request help through the Family Reunion Organizer support to be given one fix option over and over and over. If that does not fix it for you, they say they can't duplicate the issue. They requested my system information (and other info) multiple times instead of reading the information that I had already given them. They just have poor technical support.The program can work with Vista but be prepared to do your own research and find fixes on your own.They do have a demo on their home page that you can download and try out. You may want to do this before purchasing the product to see if it works with your system if you are nervous about fixing errors on your own."
1,Horrible,"The CD was a true disappointment. The songs/carols are almost unrecognizable. I wish I had never ordered it. My expectations were so much higher. It didn't meet my tatse at all even though I don'yt go for the regular Holiday ho-ho-ho music either. But stay away from this CD, after 10 minutes you are sick of it."
4,Truly the old breed,Interesting read of a diary kept amoung some of the toughest of times. Not a combat thriller by any means as the author was a first sergeant of an artillery company so there is very little reference to combat other than being bombed and seeing the aftermath of the great battles. Excellent portrayal of the living conditions and life in the Corps in the early years of the war in the south Pacific.
2,not very interesting,"I just finished this book and compared to E. Sledge's With the old breed at Pelelieu and Okinawa, it is tedious and rather uninteresting. More time is spent by the author telling the reader what time they had chow than anything of major interest going on while he was at Guadalcanal, etc. Life in the rear echelon was, no doubt, tedious and boring, and this diary reflects that. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they have nothing better to do some afternoon."
4,Top Secret !!,"This book contains all the information you ever wanted to know about Starfleet Intelligence, and even discusses the infamous Section 31 briefly. Included in the back of the book are several ideas of Campaigns that might be run using Starfleet Intelligence characters, though there are no complete campaigns within the book. The primary drawbacks to this supplement are the same failings that Last Unicorn's ""A Fragile Peace: The Neutral Zone Campaign"" possessed, this book too is printed in black and white, and contains little by way of new character overlays or species templates. Although there are examples of characters who are members of the Cardassian Obsidian Order, and the Romulan Tal Shiar, it might have been helpful to have actual Species Templates for these kinds of characters included in the sourcebook."
4,"Good, if starting from scratch","I think the book is good whether you just got a copy of VS.NET beta 2 and you need some hints to get started. If you really want to do something professional with VS.NET this isn't the book for you. There aren't many technical details. In a few words, if you are looking for documentation to help you make money with VS.NET try another book or you'll lose both time and money, instead if you are looking for a rather general overview of VS.NET features, it could be of some help; it is well written and some parts even amusing."
2,Typical MS. More gloss than substance.,"I purchased this book at a Microsoft ""technical"" training day. In typical MS fashion, and just like the day itself, the book tends to gloss over details and provide little real information.If you know nothing about .NET then this book might be ok for you. But you can find loads of free information on the internet, either from the MS site itself, or from one of the excellent developer sites such as [...].If you are looking for in-depth details then this is not the book for you."
3,Good for Managers - too little detail for developer's intro,"If you are manager looking for a high level technical overview of .Net this is a good book. If you are a non-Microsoft developer looking for an overview this book will also probably be useful to you. However, if you are even the least bit familiar with .Net concepts and have done a little ASP programming then this book is just to simplistic to be worth your time. I also think that the author's humor is overrated (although the book is out of date Woody Leonard's ""Windows 3.1 Programming for Mere Mortals"" is the definitive example of how to write a technical book with humor)!"
1,YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING,"I won this book for free at a Microsoft .NET seminar--and it's not worth what I paid for it!This books contains absolutely nothing worthwhile. I suppose the target audience is management, so maybe that explains it. It's extremely general, has little technical content and has too many cutesy little phrases and asides.The chapter on ADO.NET--an essential component of .NET, isn't even included in the printed book--you have to download it from the web.In general:* Where's the beef?* Only useful for someone with little technical or development background.* Focuses too much on web services.* Core technologies omitted.* Since I can't give it no stars, I gave it one."
3,"Great book, but not for admins.",The book did give a good backround on .NET from a developers point of view. If you are looking for a technical overview for adminstration of .NET this book is not for you.
3,Interesting but frustrating,"As a manager who has worked across many technologies over the years but recently in the Java world I found this book both interesting, and useful to get an overview of .Net, but also frustrating because it was superfical in some areas and then dived into too much detail occasionally.Also whilst I quite liked David Platt's humour I also found the sniping at Java irritating. .Net is not new - everything in it has been done before - what MS bring to play is their marketing muscle and their knowledge of development tools. Much was made of first mover advantage in 97-99 but we have a saying at work that the second mouse gets the cheese. That is what I think MS will do with .Net and why for managers with a technical bias this is a good read to see where MS are going"
4,Short and to the point,"This is one of the shortest programming books I have ever read. It is approximately 198 pages. Unfortunately, the book glosses over much of the material. You may not learn much, but you will learn it quickly. It is a good introduction to .NET and will definitely help you understand the longer asp.net and VB.net books you will read. I give it three stars for the material and five for the length. Overall, it accomplishes what it promises (an introduction). I give it four stars."
1,Introducing Microsoft .NET,"If you're just looking for a technical overview or conversation level discussion of Microsoft .NET, don't buy this book. This book is strictly written to help bring Microsoft programmers or other serious Web application architects / programmers getting assigned to a .NET programming project up to speed."
2,VERY BRIEF introduction to .NET,"This is not the book you want in order to learn .NET. It has barely any core technique I want inside.If you just want to have VERY brief introduction to .NET, this book might be OK, otherwise, it does not have much inside."
2,Informative and annoying,"It seems that the author has a fear of not being able to deliver a satisfying content. Thus he comes arond many issues by writing to meny humorous bits that (in the long run) tends to get in the way of the actual information. -I prefer a natural mixture of both information and humour.-But, if the reader is able to look through (or like) the author's personal jitter, it can be a quite an informative book."
1,Worst introduction one could hope for,"Guys, if this is Microsoft's official way of ""introducing"" .NET there's something deeply wrong in Redmond. This book is short and costs way too much for what it's worth. Doesn't explain anything you cannot grasp from a short technet search, and in fact there's more on the [web] site than in the whole book. The attempts of the author at humour are pityful. In my opinion, this book totally [has] no help."
3,As good as it gets for these blokes...,"The Flaming Stars are a curious combo, one frought with paradoxes and seemingly incongruous coincidences. The band rocks forth with garage-surf simplicity, yet wallows in singer Max Decharne's annoying noir pretensions. The band's attack is streamlined and fierce, but Decharne's voice is a mannered warble, like Iggy Pop with no sense of humor. The thing is, sometimes it all comes together perfectly. This is rare, maybe once per record, but the result can be a blast. Songs like ""Face On the Barroom Floor"" and ""Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"" are perfect modern rock'n'roll. But that's a small percentage -- the rest is simply Decharne posturing, imaging himself as some Euro-drifter in a rock and roll caberet that never existed. This is easily their best CD, since it filters out the crud that blocks up their records. Still, there are annoyances -- for example, since when has the rightfully reknowned Toe Rag studios ever sounded so tiny and abraisive?"
5,This is the Every Mother`s Son at there absolute BEST,I placed ads and looked all over the place for the disc that included the song Allison Dozer but I found it at Amazon. Why don't you add this song to your sample list and let the people hear what a SMASH TUNE it is.....
5,Valuable scholarly contribution and a good read.,"Suzie Rodriguez' latest book, ""Wild Heart,"" is a valuable contribution to scholarship for this important literary period. I totally disagree with the reviewer who sounds like a disgruntled and misogynistic individual, giving in to his atavistic views. Perhaps he would do best ""staying in the kitchen"" himself, washing dishes. He would also do well to take a spelling course.As a Ph.D., literature professor for over 35 years, both in Paris and the United States, I found this a well researched and important book. I will include it in my future courses on the expat period."
5,A Wonderful Bio of NCB,"I picked up this book before heading on a trip back east and came back with a glowing review. This is an amazingly well researched book that was written with humor and in many cases love that the author developed for NCB.What could have been a dry, boring dissertation on one of the most colorful individuals of the last few centuries is a excellent, very quick read. There were several situations when I wished that Ms. Rodriguez had been allowed to include all of her findings and research in the book.A STRONG recommendation for this wonderful book!"
1,Save Your Money,"Readers enthusiastic about early 20th century Paris or Lesbian studies will certainly be disappointed by the unsubstantial content and questionable scholarship of this book. Apparently, the author never interviewed anyone who actually knew Barney. She recounts undocumented 100-year-old private conversations as if they were solid fact. Some of her assertations leads one to think that Rodriguez doesn't speak French and certainly does not have more than a superficial understanding of the historical events through which Barney lived.However, Rodrguez' related cookbook is quite charming. She'd do best to stay in the kitchen and leave the big research to professional Lesbain studies scholars.Barney's original texts are still in print. Anyone interested in this fascinating woman would do better to go straight to the source and skip this opportunistic, amaturish waste of paper."
5,Its an extremely well designed tool.,"I own several of these Bessey clamps in various lengths, and I think the world of them. I have never experienced the bar ""bowing"" like other clamp bars tend to do. With a reasonable pricetag, I think these are some of the better all-around clamps on the market."
2,Not,"Not the melodic rocker as expected. It's ok, but if you are expecting to find an 80's gem here don't bother."
1,"Extremely biased, poorly written disaster.","This book has 3 chapters on FDR's personal life and 1 on Eleanor's. It contains very few historical facts, and often goes on for pages and pages doing nothing but spouting the author's opinions. It even has an acrostic poem to 'describe' FDR that includes words like 'Likable.' Another example of this bias is a quote from page 41... ""Coolidge was happy to play the tunes big business wanted to hear- and it was music to the fat cats' ears."" Whether or not you share the opinions expressed in this book, they should not be presented to children as fact. That doesn't help them learn about history, it teaches them how to think.Here is a link to an analysis of another book by Hakim in the same series:[...]"
2,Very hard to find particular chapters,"We are using this with Tapestry of Grace, and I was very glad to see it in audible form. However, the audible version has only 6 tracks, so in order to have your children listen to a particular chapter, you have to listen to the whole thing yourself, and write done the time stamp for each chapter. The original book has 42 chapters, so this is a big hassle.The narration is good, and the quality is fine, but the lack of proper chapter tracks is very irritating, and almost renders the product nonfunctional for my purposes. Unless you intend to listen to it in order, without skipping any chapters, you might want to just buy the paper book."
2,More poetry than history,"Strangely written book. I understand it's meant for kids but even then, history is history. I expected the language to be lighter than standard history books, but this is way over the top. Too fruity and poetic in writing style. Author deviates from the flow to focus on strange highlights that are not so important from a historical perspective, and then rushes through some that I would think were more important. Very strange book, not recommended."
3,The work but the pins seem too loose,"I have 6 ceiling lights with this bulb in and when they are installed they are loose in the socket, any slight movement and they fall out. The only thing keeping them in place is the cover holds them . They don't last that long either I have to replace them after a few years of use, less than the 5 to 10,000 hrs rated."
1,RIP after brief period,"I bought three of the GE ECO quad tubes about 1 1/2 years ago to replace tubes from another manufacturer that burned out after about 6 years. All of the GE bulbs have gone dead. Laundry room is dark. I will not buy more of these pricey, short-life GE bulbs"
2,I ordered the wrong one,This bulb might be very good but I ordered the wrong one. This one has four pins and I needed the two pin one.
1,Do not buy this adapter!,"Terrible adapter. Took it out of the box, installed it and my computer never recognized it. Installed it in another known good PCI slot and it still didn't work.Contacted their tech support via email and received a response asking me for more info. They said they'd send a return authorization number but never did. Subsequent emails went unanswered. Finally gave up and bought another brand.Don't waste your money on this junk."
4,Very good light duty bar clamp,"If you are going to use this for clamping with any significant force, get a heavier clamp. Working with picture frames and similar light work, or in reduced lengths, this clamp will work well for you. When I stretch it out to ~15 inches and apply enough force to push 2 x 4's together on a biscuit, it flexes by bowing the I-beam in a semi-circular arc. This throws the jaws out of alignment and applies and off center force that causes the joints flex out of square.In summary, if you are doing light work, this clamp is a great value. If you need moderate clamping force, save your money and buy a more appropriate clamp that won't flex on you."
4,An essential home craftsman's clamp.,"This clamp is the perfect little tool to have around your house when you're building or mending small drawers or chairs. This is not a heavy duty piece, but you can manually tighten it to the point where it damages your object. Its important to remember that it doesnt have cushions and you need to use some kind of wooden or hard rubber spacer to protect the surface of your object."
2,Cute but unconfertable,"These skates were super cute, but they were too heavy for me, and that made them uncomfortable for me to wear. They were a little long, so they were too big for me. I usually wear a size 10 though. Not sure what socks would be best, since they are narrow as well. The leather that rests on your calf dug into my skin.I ended up returning them because it was really bought on a whim purchase."
4,"Good skate for the price, stiff ride though","For the price you can't really ask for too much, they work fine and roll along okay... kind of a stiff ride and the wheels don't spin as well as I'd like but all in all they're good. And they look awesome."
2,too stiff and too hard,The skates are too stiff and too hard.... And the heal in way too hight for skating. I ordered a 6 and im normally a 7 it fit good but the stiffness of it does not help.
2,Disappointed,The skates look made well but look different that pictured on Amazon. Also they were a whole size too big. I returned them and I am anxiously awaiting for my refund. They should not put pictures of the product up unless they look exactly like what they are shipping.
2,You get what you pay for,"I wanted to love these skates. They are white and pink, with eyelet lacing and exactly as I remembered from my childhood. But I can't skate in them. I don't know if I just got a bad pair, but they are horrible. The wheels have no give in them (I even had them loosened as much as possible at the skating rink) so turns are a challenge and there is no smooth movement and they run large, so they bunch up at my ankle in a very uncomfortable way. I prefer renting rink skates to these."
3,"Good, Except for One Major Thing...","Although the construction of the boots and plates are good, the bearings are horrible. Bearings are little metal washer-like discs that are in the middle of the wheel, and help the wheel spin and stay on the skate. These bearings are cheaply constructed, total crap...after only two skate sessions at the rink, the wheels of my skates were ""wobbly"" and loose because the bearings were falling apart! When the tech at the pro shop took apart one of my wheels to remove a bad bearing, the whole bearing broke apart in his hand. I had to get all of them replaced...which was expensive."
2,dangerous cheap garbage,"After about 6 wears, though they look good, wheels are lose and expert at rink told me dangerous and unrepairable. i would spend more for a better quality product as these definitely fall into the category of ""you get what you pay for."" Don't waste your money!"
3,NOT BAD BUT BE CAREFUL.....,I BOUGHT THEM FOR MY DAUGHTERS THEY ARE HAPPY WITH THEM BUT BE CAREFUL I RECOMMEND TO CHECK UP EVERY SCREWS AND NUTS BECAUSE ONE OF THEM FALL APART WHILE MY LITTLE ONE WAS SKATING ON THE FLOOR OF ROLLER MAGIC.. ONE OF THE GUY WORKING FOR ROLLER MAGIC TOLD ME ABOUT THE SKATE WAS FALLING APART .. HE PUT IT BACK TOGETHER .. I COULD'VE GIVE THEM 4 STARS BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER COMPLAIN FROM MY OLDER DAUGHTER SHE SAID THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT UNSTABLE .. SO I THINK WHEN YOU BUY SOMETHING CHEAP DON'T EXPECT TO BE PERFECT. I PAID ALMOST $45 FOR THEM THEY ARE CHEAP BUT NOT SO MUCH I THINK SO ...
1,Broken,I bought these skates for my daughter less than 2 months ago and the wheels are falling apart on them. I have had to spend extra money buying new wheels as the only other option would be to pay for shipping and only getting a partial refund. I am not happy with this order at all!
2,Do not waste your time or money,"I ordered this skate since I could no longer find my original skates and my daughter was interested in skating. After reading through the reviews I took a chance and ordered a pair. This was a mistake!! I ordered the correct size but the boot is very narrow--and I do not have wide feet! Not to mention that the skate key broke the first time I used it to tighten the wheels. After putting them on and going out on the floor with my dughter, I could instantly tell that the wheels were warped on both sides! I have not made up my mind whether to send them back or order new wheels. I have ordered the Riedell Artistic skate for 130.00. It is well worth it and they are the perfect pair of skates! Please spend the extra money and buy what you really want in a skate!"
3,Just Ok,"The wheels are very slippery and I do not recommend them for indoor use. As stated in previous reviews, order a size smaller than you usually wear. My shoe size is a 10 and I can almost wear an 8 in these skates. Once I replace the wheels to a higher quality they will be great."
5,sizing,"These skates are beautiful and well made. However ,based on other reviews I ordered a size 3 for my 10 yr old grandaughter. That is the size she usually wears. It came and was almost too tight. I returned them and am now getting 5s. My grandaughter has very narrow feet, so unless sizing has changed recently or it is off on some sizes and right on others, I'd order large for a growing girl."
3,Pretty Skates,"The skates were pretty to look at but the boot and wheels were too plastic. But i guess for the price i paid they would have to do. Besides, the recipient enjoyed them, who happens to be a 9 year old girl that is just beginning to roll!"
3,"Great for a loop around the rink, Beware of asphalt!","I ordered these rollerskates to skate on in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and they were great going down the smooth surface of Central Park West, but once the parade hit the rough asphalt of 42nd Street on our way to Herald Square the front two wheels on my right foot came loose! Luckily, they held on long enouch for me to do a few loops around Johnny Weir in front of Macy's but I'll need a wrench to repair them before their next performance. Very cute though and I thought the sizing was only a half size off."
2,Only lasts for about 30 days,"I bought these skates and have skated about 2 hours a week for the first month I've owned them. Now the wheels locked up and I had to replace them. If you are going to skate occasionally, then these might be good skates for you. Or if you are a beginner and don't want to rent skates, these might be good skates for you. But if you are going to skate regularly, don't buy these as they won't last long."
4,Can't beat the price,"I bought these for my self after reading the reviews, they do tend to run a little on the large size, but just put in a pair of gel insoles love the comfort. I guess what they say is true you don't forget how to skate, it has been 20 plus years since I had a pair on, and after a few times or skating was right back into the swing of things."
3,pink wheels,"love the pink and white. The breaks weren't rubber they were like this hard plastic. When I had to used the breaks I wore down 1/4 of the tip. Kinda scary. I also read some one's review that the sizes were running big. My shoe size is 8, however i really needed a size 6. something to consider before purchasing. I also found them cheaper at Big 5 Sporting Goods. Sad about that too."
4,Good Value,I bought these skates for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas and she really likes them. The wheels needed loosened the first time but worked good after that. The skates run big so I ordered a size smaller and they fit well. These are a good value.
1,Bearings bad after using once,"After skating one day for 3 hours, some of the bearings are bad in my daughter's skates, making the wheels wobble and making a clicking noise.After reading other reviews we bought a full size down, which is a perfect fit."
3,Nice Skates.... BUT....,"I bought these skates for my birthday skate night. I turned 35 and I like to skate once in a while and I was so tired of using rental skates. I also bought one size DOWN because the other reviews said to do so. They were right. I wear a 8 1/2 - 9 so I bought an 8 and it fit just right. The skates actually skated fine at the skate rink but I did notice that the wheels didn't give me the speed I wanted or the glide. I had to work harder to get the speed. While at the skating rink, I met the guy that taught my MOM how to skate. My mom (55) skates better (and more often) than me. And the guy looked at my skates and said it's a good body, and after messing with my wheels, he said the wheels and barron (skate talk) are CRAP! So he suggested I get new wheels if I really want to skate like I do... but that is going to run me about $115!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I might save up for it because I love to skate and I want to get better. So, the skates are nice, but I do not get the speed I wanted."
2,beginner skates,"looking for low cost beginner skates - you found it.plastic wheels - hard to turn.really run large - be careful, if you order wrong amazon will charge you for shipping, they don't seem to work with you if you wanted to exchange for smaller size even though on the front page not warning of how sizes run ( you get a refund then have to order again)(shouldn't have to read reviews to find out they run large)look Great! perform OK! (slow)talk to your local roller rink about help with size. (they may have some used ones lower in price but will be much better.)"
3,Needs better bearings..and run large,"I followed other reviewers comments about size. I am normally a womens sz 7 and ordered a 5 and they fit fine. However, when you try to ""move"" the wheel with your finger it does not move freely, it stays put. I am a mom that loves to skate with her kiddos and have since I was young, so not a pro-skater, but not inexperienced either. I still prefer my 17 year old skates to these, as they freely turn when prompted and would roll down the driveway if I put them at the top (on incline). This pair would not go anywhere."
3,awesome skates but....why are they 2 sizes to big!?,I bought these skates for a Halloween costume and thankfully I ordered them a few weeks ago. When I got the skates they were TWO sizes too big! I bought size 9's and the skates say they are size 9 however when I measured them they were a size 11! I had to return them and reorder the skates in size 7 instead of size 9.... so if you are gonna get these skates make sure you order them small. However besides the sizing problems the skates look and feel amazing! In the description it says the skates are indoor/outdoor but I tried to skate with them outside and the wheels they come with feel a bit weird on cement so I bought different wheels for better control.
2,Beware size discrepancies!!,"We ordered this product in a size 8 and when we received it, it was marked size 8 but it was easily a normal size 10. We had to pay to ship it back and exchange it for a smaller size, when there should have been an advisory that the skates run extremely large. It cost $19 dollars to ship it back for the exchange in addition to the original cost of the skates plus shipping. Other than that the skates are true to the description and are very cute. Therefore the skates actually cost $69 instead of $50 (including shipping)."
5,Chicago Womens Rink Skate,"This item was described perfectly! It fit great and looked even better in person. I made the right purchase for re-learning how to skate, which by the way is not exactly like always knowing how to ride a bike! I would recommend this product and would purchase a more expensive higher quality pair once I have accomplished my mission of skating again. Great quality for price and beginner skater or re-learning skating skills."
5,Great for the price.,"These are really cute skates, brown heel with pink wheels with blue lettering. They run a little big, I purchased a size 5 and I usually wear a size 5.5 woman's shoe. They seem really comfortable but I have not taken them out for a spin yet."
1,Horrible!,"These skates are dangerous e 2nd time I used them one of the wheels came loose and the ball bearings came out! I was skating at the skating rink and had felt something funny going on with the wheel, I left the rink and and bearings were falling everywhere! I was so worried other people who were skating we're gonna fall . Beware of these skates do not buy!"
3,Please help with size and color,My 15-year old daughter and I are 8 1/2 and were wondering what size should we get these. I`ve read on the reviews that you should get a size 6 or 7 and others said that there size 8 fits perfectly on them. Please help. Also do these come in black or brown. I really look forward to the brown more.
5,Another excellent buy,My wife really loves her skates. We usually go skating every weekend. It's fun.
5,Just what I wanted!!,"These are just the right feel and fit. Lightning fast shipment, Awesome price!! A+++++"
3,Retro. Basic. Pink. Pricey.,"My daughter squealed with delight as she opened these skates as a gift for her eighth birthday. Mission accomplished.The construction is heavy. The design is retro, and resembles something from the Soviet Union or North Korea. The style is so basic, and even the packaging seems unimaginative. She wanted quad skates in a girlie color, so this is it.I can't believe that these cost this much."
4,Good for the price!!,"They were a little stiff at first, possibly just need some breaking in. True to size. Not the fastest wheels but you will still have fun skating and still get in a good exercise. Love the old school look."
4,L-O-V-E,"Really comfortable & cute! Item arrived quickly, however one shoelace was frayed. ***SKATES FIT BIG - I TYPICALLY WEAR A SIZE 9 SHOE AND SIZE 8 SKATES FIT PERFECTLY***"
2,No search!,"Book itself is great, well-written, etc. but the search feature doesn't work in the Kindle edition, which STINKS because this is a very ""by subject"" companion. If you're using this to get to certain chapters, and not just reading it straight through, I would not recommend."
2,Tried to Hard,"This book could have been really fun but I think the author tried too hard to include ""noir"" sayings. And I can't imagine that anyone in this guys family wouldn't have tried to see what was wrong with him. And are we supposed to believe that someone who is this dumb could actually come up with all the clever sayings? And that he was able to act like this after a week of reading detective novels? Will not read the follow up book -- this was just painful to get through."
4,Serious thinking not withheld,"As the first book in the Twelve Candle's Club Series Becky's Brainstorm does a good job of setting the tone for those that will follow. Becky and her three friends; Tricia, Jess, and Cara; form an odd jobs club during summer vacation. Becky is desperate to earn enough money prevent her family from having to move to another state. Many hilarious hi-jinks follow and lead to a perfect conclusion.Schulte's theology is evident throughout the book as Becky is led to seek and trust in God for her future. Clearly aimed at 8-12 year old Evangelical girls this book succeeds at blending life and spirituality without becoming too preachy. The English level is excellent and obviously the author knows what she is doing in writing serial novels for this genre."
2,not for me,Seat just rubs me the wrong way. The inside of my thigh got sore and is not made for hybrid bikes or the road conditions I ride. Would return but its not worth the money or the hassle. The new one I got for my wife was not much more and twice the seat.
2,Not the answer to corner clamping needs,"Frankly this clamp is not up to the quality one expects from bessey. Sure it is built like a tank. It does create a pretty good 90% angle joint, the problem I have is that it really doesn't work at all in a lot of cases. I found better solutions with strap clamps and k-body clamps in sets for cabinetry. I think I have used this clamp less than a dozen times in the past two years. Anyone want one slightly used -- cheap."
5,"A Bobby Short convert, thanks to this CD","I have not been too much of a fan of Bobby Short in the past, because I greatly prefer jazz singing to cabaret singing. But I took a flyer on this CD because it had some unusual songs, plus Short works out with a jazz combo on this recording from the Café Carlyle. Short really does about everything a jazz singer does, except that he's more theatrical. I loved the CD, from beginning to end - great songs, put over by a first-rate entertainer whom I've got to look into more."
5,25' Projector Extension Cord,This is great. I was going crazy trying to figure out how to plug in my ceiling mounted projector to my my UPS. The projector has the same strange type of power outlet as a computer. I thought I was going to have to use the short power cord that came with the project and then an extension cord. The problem with that is that the connection would be mid-way between the projector and the equipment rack. This cord solves the problem. It is long enough to go all the was from the ceiling and along the ceiling to the wall and then down the wall to the equipment rack.
4,Superb Americana,"If you like such artists as Son Volt,Steve Earle and Neil Young then this excellent CD is for you.Sure,it's your basic Alt.Country/Americana sound but what's surprising is the strenght of the songs.If someone like Ryan Adams put this out it would be hailed as a real return to form so don't let it pass you by just 'cos you've never heard of Jason Walker.Superb and i can't wait to hear what he does next."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this retractable headset from Amazon.com about 3 months ago for $13. Besides being relatively heavy and clunky, the plug often slipped out of my iPod. Also, it gets stuck and won't retract. And when I pulled on it to get it out, the ear plug fell apart and now it won't play in one ear. Additionally, it still gets tangled and occasionally it won't retract back. I am already looking for another pair of earphones. If I could give this product less than 1 star, I would. It is cheaply made and not worth the money."
1,Cheaply-made,"I _just_ purchased this item and as soon as I listened to it for the first time, I realized it was a low-quality item. Perhaps I received a defective unit, I don't know. It seems to retract correctly, however the sound quality is poor. The headphone terminal might be to blame as it appears to slip out too easily. Plus, if I move the cord even a little bit, I notice the connection break with a very annoying crackling sound. I consider this a wasted $20. I might try a more solid-looking brand in the future, however, I could not recommend this to anyone.I actually decided to keep this unit. Yesterday, the retractor snagged and the cord would not come loose. I decided to just throw it away. I have been very delicate with it and still its effective lifespan for me was about 10 months. Piece of junk."
4,Retracting feature is great,"I have used this set with my I-pod for several months. I purchased this unit because of the retractable ear bud feature and I am pleased with it. I used to have a problem with any other ear buds cords tangling up. I have had no problems with tangling or retracting with this unit. The sound is acceptable -- in fact it's great for the price. I use my noise canceling ear buds when I want superior sound, but these are perfect for everyday use."
4,"The book is fine, but on page 125...","On page 125 Bennet writes: ""This [Modus Ponens] is a valid inference as long as the two premises are true"". But the sentence should read: ""This is a valid inference, and as long as the two premises are true the conclusion will be true"".The original formulation is in fact mistaken. Modus Ponens, like all valid inferences, is valid also in the case in which the two premises are false.The standard definition of validity says that an argument is valid if and only if if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. Since ""if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true"" is a conditional statement, it is true in the case in which its antecedent is false (and therefore the premises are false). So the original formulation confuses validity with truth."
5,Learn logic in a friendly way,"I really enjoyed this book. I've taken Critical Thinking, Philosophy, and Discrete Math at University but this book clarified ideas to me that I found difficult in formal classes. The book is a friendly, popular version of formal logic. The author presents history, nuances, and examples of logic that we easily misunderstand. Please realize the book is a readable subject of logic and not meant to replace expensive course textbooks. Afterall, look at the difference in price. If you truly love logic as I do, you'll find the book interesting and informative. If you read this book, then you will learn more about logic than you already know."
4,Solid LSAT Preparation Tool and Supplement to Introductory Logic Courses,"This book is a clear, concise, well-written analysis of many of the most important concepts in modern logic. Probably its greatest virtue is the light it sheds on the numerous logical errors we make in conversation and on paper and on how best to overcome these errors. I would recommend this book as a primer or supplement to introductory and intermediate courses in logic, or as a supplemental LSAT preparation tool."
3,"Excellent, but not so easy","I have to say this book on logic is excellent but i found it a bit difficult at times, especially as it pogresses further & deeper into the subject. I feel at times the writer could have explained it better by using shorter & simpler ways. Some of the example tests are awfully interesting & will indulge many i'm sure who are interested to know about the basics of Logic. I would have given it a 4 or 5 but i feel the title is not as easy as it sounds but i do recommend it none the less."
3,Off the Mark,"The selection of topics for discussion in this book is a bit mystifying. One would think that this book would attempt to make logic simple. Bennett has chosen to discuss mnemonics for 64 moods of syllogisms (of which only 4 are valid), but does not elaborate (significantly) on such concepts as ""maldistributed middle"" or the fallacy of four terms, which seem to me to be much more relevant to avoiding errors in logic. There is a lot of historical discussion about who invented what method of diagraming syllogisms and the psychological problems with being logical, but there is relatively little about informal fallacies. Perhaps the problem is that the title of the book should be ""The Topic of Logic Made Simple"" instead of one that implies ""Being Logical Made Simple."""
5,Audrey II,Shel Silverstein is great and he sounds a lot like Audrey II from the 1986 film Little Shop of Horrors.
5,little clamp that's a tool not a toy,"I own Bessey K bodies from 12"" to 96"" and Bessey tradesmen clamps from 12"" to 36"" and the clamps that I use the most without a doubt are the smaller clamps for subassemblies, securing work to the bench, etc. These little 6"" tradesmen clamps are my new go-to small clamp when I don't want an excessively long clamp bar hanging out from some work getting in the way etc. These little clamps are real tools not toys - they are very strong and give all the clamping pressure that you'd expect to get from a tradesmen clamp. I only bought 4 but will be looking to pick-up a few more as I'm very pleased with how they have become so useful in the shop."
3,2nd class design,The construction is good and the design works well but is not as usable as the clutch type. I would not choose this type again.
2,Too ethereal,"The operatic quality of the singer's voice is beautiful, but the songs lose any rhythm and sound repetitive. A few songs have very annoying instrumentals; we had to program the cd player to skip those."
1,Yuck,Tedious - boring - annoying vocalsIf you're looking for a good lullabye cd for an infant or child - AVOID this one. I made the mistake of picking it up on the recommendations of the other reviews here. Big mistake. This is horrible.
1,NOT WORTHWHILE,"I thought this would be a wonderful addition to my niece's bedtime music collection. I'm glad I listened to this before sending it, as I am extremely disappointed with the repetitive, non-soothing, non-tender treatment by Aureole and singer Heidi Grant Murphy. I am now stuck with this horrible CD. I don't have the heart to try to give it to someone else, somehow that just doesn't seem right, so the best I can do is write this review to warn others."
1,tedious,"I ordered this CD based on the high marks given by other commentators. It might be ok for very small babies, but my son did not seem to like it better than the classical music that was often on. And I found the CD really tedious to listen to."
4,Excellent book for mothers to be.,100 Promises to My Baby is an excellent book for first time mothers to be. I have ordered two for baby shower presents.
5,This is the Weissenborn to get,"Others have written about the book's quality. It's a bit daunting for beginners, but someone has written a ""My First Weissenborn"" for bassoon newbies. I have ""Practical Method"" and have used it for years. However, this larger version, called just ""Method for Bassoon,"" is the one to get.The additional material (compared to ""Practical Method"") is a popular set of key studies by Milde which are often assigned to students. When I moved and had to get a new teacher, she assigned the Milde studies. So I bought the ""Method for Bassoon"" book to replace my old, beat up ""Practical Method"" book, even though the Milde studies are also available separately. Either book will carry a student along for years of learning. This book is still in print and easily available from dedicated sheet music online vendors, even if Amazon doesn't have it right now. When I bought it, it was the SAME PRICE brand new as the ""Practical Method."" You shouldn't be paying a premium for this version."
3,Carex bath bench,Purchased this for my 91 yrs. old mother who is having difficulty getting in and out of the bathtub. Description read it was 6 inches in height. When arrived it is approx. 6 inches before you add the legs. With the legs on it is higher than the tub. Unfortunately was unable to use bench due to height and slides in tub without the legs.It is easy to assemble and would be great for a shower chair. But I'm looking for something to use to sit down in the water.
4,shower stool,This is a simple no nonsense stool for tub or showerIt is strong and stable although light in weight. Itis easy to assemble. It does it's job without slipping.
5,big body bath seat,"My mother is over-weight and has problems standing for very long. I bought this chair and it is awesome for her to use. It is very sturdy, and easy to put together compaired to the other one I purchased."
5,Couldn't be better.,"When I ordered this bench I wasn't sure it would fit in my narrow built-in tub/shower. But it fits easily. It's sturdy and gives good support. One word of caution: If you shower standing up then sit to wash your hair, be sure to rinse the soapy water off before you sit down. A real plus is the adjustable leg height. Amazon makes ordering easy and saves me time and money by not having to run around looking for what I need."
1,Could have killed myself!,"I have this shower seat and would not recommend to anyone. With a cast on my left leg, after my shower,I went to stand and put my left knee on the seat while standing with my right foot, the seat broke down the middle and I went down the wall and landed on my back with my head against the wall. I have a bumbed up wrist, knee and shoulder and head, also cuts on my knee from the broken pieces that came loose as it broke..all this to go along with this big cast. It made me wish I were DEAD ! It says it can hold up to 400 lbs...hogwash! I don't weight 200 lbs.!!!! If I knew how, I would get it pulled off the market!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,This bath bench has shortcomings,"I am not sure what the target customer base is for this product. I purchased it for our guest bathroom, which has an oversized shower stall, for my brother's visit. My brother lost both his legs, and I wanted something where he did not have to sit on the floor of the shower. Unfortunately, this chair sits a little too high and lacks the stability necessary for him to climb into it, and we do not have shower hand rails to assist him. So, I tried using it in one of the our bathrooms that have a tub, but it is too big for a standard sized tub. In the end I had to return the product. All, I can figure is this is for someone to take a shower who can stand, but doesn't want to. It is too risky to use for a person who is infirmed or disabled."
1,a part is broken,"The product looked good, but when i put together the legs of stool, a lock/hook of a leg has been broken.It might be rare case, but I cannot trust this product anymore. I have to return it...In addition, I think the stool is too large and hard to handle for normal bath-tabs."
3,Sturdy but not suitable for tub use.,"This is a strong and well-made chair. It might be great for a stall-type shower or some other purpose, but I found it rather useless in a tub. It occupies a lot of space. It also increased the difficulty of climbing out of the tub. It is hard to get out standing with the chair in the way. Someone suggested getting my legs out while still seated. That idea is dangerous; the chair started to topple when I tried to shift weight onto my feet. Nice product, but it doesn't meet my needs."
5,The Best!!,"After knee surgery this works (GREAT),If you have knee or hip surgery this seat will work great in the tub."
3,"very sturdy, a little big","Fits in the middle of the tub, but doesn't leave much room for standing. Nice and sturdy. May use it as a table on my very small terrace."
5,Very Sturdy,I was looking for something sturdy. I am a large person and the average benchesjust aren't strong enough. I want to be confident that when I sit it will hold me. Thisbench does the job. I am very happy with it. The seat in nice and wide. It's stilllight enough to move around easily. Have been using it for a couple months and amhappy with my purchase.
3,Sturdy,"I had back surgery in June and since then my legs are numb. During a shower if I feel like I have to sit down, this shower bench will enable me to do so safely. It feels sturdy enough to hold my weight.It was really easy to put together. I was worried it would not fit into my tub but it does. It is a little chunky looking and I felt it could have been sleeker.Not too many choices out there so this was the one I got cause the price was right. I would recommend this product.Mimi"
5,the wonder of you,This song is a reminder of my wife. The words fit her to a tee. Having met Ray Peterson in Albuquerque N M this past year was a wonderful expearence. He said a prayer for my wife who is getting over cancer. He signed a picture for her and he will remain in our hearts forever.
5,fantastic,"Ray, if you read this please contact Cdr. Donn Bynum (Hammond, LA ie. Kintally Kastle-Oak Knoll Country Club golf tournament 1978) at zigzag@gamewood.net"
3,Does anyone remember?,"Does anyone remember the hit (in Australia anyway) ""You Thrill Me""? I remember this amazing voice range and I can't believe its not on this disc as it's the only listed of his."
3,Lushly Padded Footstool,"As others have noted, this stool is nicely padded but too weak for sitting. It is strong enough for resting the feet. Overall, it's cheaply made but has a fairly nice look.What others have not noted, however, is the strong odor emanating from its paint job. The chemical-like odor was so powerful when new that I had to relegate the item to the basement for about a month before the stench diminished sufficiently to make the stool tolerable under my desk. No telling what is in that made-in-China paint. Hopefully it isn't toxic. I wouldn't trust it around a small child."
3,Good but,This is a great little stool for the price. I purchased it so my elderly dog would have an easier time getting on and off the sofa. It needed new fabric to suit my decor and a coat of paint to suit as well as cover the funky smell of the finish it comes with.Overall I think it a worthy purchase.
1,Weak,"I purchased this item in December 2010. Just a foot stool, no heavy weight. This month September 2011, it just came apart.Very disappointed!!"
3,"okay, leg broke in a week",Very pretty but not pink like it might look. Used it as a step stool for her bed but after one week it broke and she is petite
2,Not well made,I stepped on this stool and fell right through it. Nice to look at but do not put much weight on it or it will fall apart. It is not built to step on. Please do not use it as a stepping stool or you will waste your money like I did. Only good to prop your a foot on.
5,Small padded footstool,"After my foot surgery, I needed to find a small footstool to elevate my foot under my desk when I returned back to work. After a large search for footstools online, I came across this one and fell in love with it. The size was perfect and I especially loved that the top was padded. I really didn't mind the fabric color where it was going to be under my desk. I also love the look of the white wood. It truly worked out well for me !! I highly recommend it ! The price was very reasonable also !"
4,THE FIRST LADY,"SHIRLEY CAESAR IS INDCREDIBLE, AS AN ARTIST,BUSINESS WOMAN,PASTOR AND ACTRESS,, SHE IS A TRUE GOSPEL DIVA May God for ever inrich you.....It is a must to see Shirley in concert or in the pulpit....she is awsome"
1,Piece of Garbage On Windows 98SE,"I agree 100% with the last reviewer. The product will install and show up in your systems manager, but will not interface with anything. I tried my printer, a camera, 2 nights messing with it, looking for updates even called their support line, same thing as the last reviewer, ""Wait for the next representative"". Yeah theyre probably all working out in the shipping area, getting returns. Waste of money and time. Nothing works with it. Dont waste yours.Update to my earlier post. Just today I sent the product back and bought the Belkin 3 Port, 2 external, 1 internal USB. Its available from Amazon, seller is Office Depot. Awesome, very precise and easy to follow instructions. Installed the drivers, plugged in the card and BOOM I was in business. Best $29.00 Ive spent on a USB card. Taught me a valuable lesson. Buying cheap, always ends up being expensive. Its totally compatible and tested to work on Windows98 98se Me, Macs and XP."
5,A Must-Read for Any Responsible Citizen,"If you want to participate effectively in your society, this book is a must-read. John Ralston Saul cuts through all the economic and corporate rhetoric that saturates our media channels on a daily basis and lays bare exactly what's happening. With the writer being an accomplished polymath, you'll learn (and if not learn, have plenty of food for thought on) everything from tax, politics/right and left, economics, economic history, globalisation, culture, debt, and much, much more.There are many writers out there who have expertise in very narrow areas, and very few true polymaths who can take on our key problems with unerring wisdom. John Ralston Saul is a godsend. I don't get why he isn't a household name. Read it and buy a copy for all your friends."
4,Product delivered and recieved,"Got my purchase as described, no surprises.Happy with what I paid for.Will buy from vendor again."
5,"to change the world,write a dictionary!","that misuse of language has characterized societies in crisis has been observed since Thucydides. The remedy,to write a dictionary,is attempted by the brave - voltaire,diderot,johnson and bierce have lite beacons in the fog. Ralston Saul here defines a vocabulary for reform."
5,TWO GREAT LP'S ON CD FOR THE PRICE OF ONE,"This cd contains both Sugarloaf's first lp entitled ""Sugarloaf"" and their second lp ""Spaceship Earth"". The two big classics are all here and in their entire extended versions ""Green-Eyed Lady"" and ""Tongue-in-Cheek"". ""Tongue-in-Cheek"" which is my favorite has some incredible guitar playing. Two lead guitars alternate and the outcome is fantastic. Also included as a bonus cut is ""Don't Call Us..."" which was their last and only hit. All in all this is classic early seventies rock. Highly recommended."
2,Marginal at best,"I was quite disappointed upon receiving my copy of this CD after seeing all the 5 star ratings given by other users. The only real standout tracks are the two commonly heard on radio - Green Eyed Lady and Don't Call Us, We'll Call You. The rest of both albums are mired in marginal production, sophomoric lyrics and way too much instrumental ""noodling."" As a keyboardist, I longed to hear more of the great B-3 organ work shown on Green Eyed Lady, but by and large it's absent. Another minor disappointment is the drumming on these albums, too many flashy attempts at fills and not enough solid groove. Compare Aerosmith's classic version of Train Kept A Rollin to the lame instrumental version here. I found myself skipping ahead looking for something worth comparing to the two above mentioned tracks and never found it."
1,"Include ""Hot Water"" so CD is complete","Why label the CD as Sugarloaf and Spaceship Earth when you do not include the complete track listing of Spaceship Earth? Better to buy the Bgo Records/Ka version that does include the complete song lists for both Sugarloaf and Spaceship Earth. Track listing isn't included on the Amazon US site, but the track listing is shown on the amazon.uk site."
3,$6.99 !!!!,Im looking forward to this movie but there is no way im going to rent it for $6.99. Ill continue to wait and see if RedBox will have it soon.
1,Poor Reconstruction of Reality -,"This is supposedly 24-hours in the 'life' of Lehman Brothers. It fails to explain the investments that got Lehman into trouble, the firm's reaction to the news that it was in trouble is nonsensical, the original scenes are unbelievable, etc., etc."
1,Marginal,"While containing an interesting philosophical view of life this movie was too short on real facts/events and too long on foul language. The story of the financial collapse is very interesting and educational, this movie missed the opportunity to add to that."
1,Waste not your money!,"I note that some reviewers share my opinion on this one, so I'll be brief. Whata waste of talent and time. It seems that the movie industry is more industryand revenue than entertainment these days. Just look at the cast. Pretty heavynames, right? But without a decent script and director, what's left? I watchedhalf of it one night and thought perhaps I was just too tired to appreciate it.The next day nothing improved, in fact it got worse. To call this slow-paced isan understatement. Unless you enjoyed that ridiculous series ""Twin Peaks"" wherecharacters stared at the wall, the wastebasket, their toenails, etc. for longperiods of time without dialog or action, you'll fall asleep here for sure."
1,boring,I did not like the movie. It was very boring. I did watch the complete movie but did not enjoy it at all
3,"A tad bit boring, mildly entertaining.","I am no fan of ""slice of life"" genre movies that just whisk us into the lives of a group of people, let us watch like peeping toms and then whisk us back out with little resolution. That is how I felt watching this movie. It had just enough spark to keep me watching until the end, hoping for a pay-off that would sock it to the evil corporate bosses....yet it left me unfulfilled. Worth watching only if there is nothing better to do. The acting from Spacey, Tucci and Bettany added enough drama to get 3 stars. I deducted two star for extremely mellow ambiance and the abrupt ending without a strong resolution. I needed some, at least one, of the employees to go just a wee bit postal to make this movie believable. No blood, No Guts = No Glory!"
3,"Good acting, but ...","I liked the acting. Stanley Tucci is particularly good, but ""Margin Call"" isn't a very deep or insightful movie about the Wall Street crisis.Find ""Too Big to Fail"" on HBO first."
4,Good movie about Wall Street office politics,"If you are looking for a ""why"" the market crashed movie this isn't really it. This movie is about the politics in these firms, how they function, and how many of these people live their lives. I found it interesting and enjoyable in that respect.Overall, the cast does a good job. I think Jeremy Irons and Spacey do an excellent job with their characters. The decision making process is these characters follow is rather interesting.The movie is not fast paced, so if you are expecting to jump from one cut scene with someone yelling ""sell"" to another with someone yelling ""buy"" this is not your movie."
4,Great cast assembled,"Everyone in this cast is stellar, especially Jeremy Irons and Kevin Spacey. This is the story of a firm that has a huge financial collapse that was its own fault. There is fallout for everyone, not just those at the firm, from firings to layoffs to general embarrassment, as well as problems that would affect others not even aware of the situation.It would probably help to understand something about trading, market shares, and such."
4,Understated Brilliance,"I am not going to summarize the plot. The acting is reason alone to watch this. Kevin Spacey carries this film at the end. It's not overly exciting, but it is a good example of what actors can do with confined space and timeline. It's not boring like I thought it would be."
3,This is a dram not a thriller,This was an interesting drama...worth watching not real happy to pay 6.99 to stream it as it will probably be free on net flix soon. There was nothing exciting about this movie. The acting was good..fiction based on recent events. The traiers call it a economic thiller...Don't expect to be sitting on the edge of your seat...
3,Great Film...mostly,"I really like this movie, thought the subject timely, the acting superb and even liked cinematography. I personally think everyone should watch this movie if for no other reason than to understand just how fragile our economy really is. Having said that I have to say the use of a certain expletive ad nauseum was really in very bad taste. My 18 year old son said that he thought the writer really couldn't have been that good if that was all he could come up with. I have to agree to some degree. It really was unnecessary. Having worked around and for and with professional people most of my adult life I have never heard people speak like this, using the F-bomb as one reviewer put it, nearly two to three times a sentence most of the film. I am not squeamish about swearing but this was gratuitous in the extreme. Other than that I thought it was a very well done film."
3,Margin Call,Good acting as you would expect from this cast. But the plot and resolution has no strong resolution and leaves you feeling incomplete and a bit ill at ease. Perhaps that was the intention: to wake people up about the dangerous financial misconduct happening in America.
2,Not very thrilling for a thriller,"Though Margin Call is advertised as a thriller, there's no suspense to be had. Someone figures out the firm's mortgage-backed securities aren't secure at all. They sit in offices having meetings for half the movie. Then they initiate a banking collapse to save the firm. Some people get fired. Some don't. Everyone comes out filthy rich. The presence of a fine cast and suspenseful music can't bring a dead story to life, though they certainly try.If you're looking for excitement, look elsewhere. If you're looking to understand the economic collapse, try NPR's Planet Money podcast."
4,Four and half,Great movie about what happens in business and finance world. Strong cast does a good job of portraying some of the ruthlessness in real life.
1,Better As 1/2-Hour TV/Movie (Commercials time included),"What a boring movie! Impressive cast all gone to waste. Too much time spent belaboring how sorry the characters' situation was. And I couldn't bring myself to care even slightly, except for the Kevin Spacey character perhaps. The pace is so slow I fell asleep during the building steps scene toward the end (yes, I managed to stay awake up to that point), and woke up to the same scene. I dicovered the guy 1 row behind was doing the same so I felt vindicated. Why did this movie even get made? Was this a lame attempt of some Wall St. producer to show they too are having a bad time? So sad I forgot to cry."
1,Lame,"Don't waste your time or money. Very slow, predictable and boring. It is rated R because every fourth line uses the ""f"" word. Otherwise it would be rated G. There is no sex, violence or action. A yarn aimed at beating up on Wall Street with a few big name actors. The one star was for the acting."
1,Many times worthless then limitless,I can't believe it has gotten an average of three stars. Nothing happened in the movie. One hundreed F.Y. words.
3,been there,"Movie was just ok, sucky ending. I expected much more. I think the story was the downfall, actors did a fine job."
3,Wtong format,"The DVD I received was not formatted to work on my Irish TV ; ie it was for the U.S. market I was, however able to view it on my computer"
2,not bad but certainly not good,"2.5 stars. I was hoping for a good movie. And I'm not sure what I got. The acting was solid. The directing was solid. Loved the camera work. But if I didn't know better I would say the script was written for a low budget film. There were very few locations...and too much dialogue (and I generally enjoy slow paced films as long as the characters are developing and I'm learning about them.) I went from enjoying the story to wondering if it were going to 'get going' to waiting for it to hurry and end. Basically there's not much to the characters and the main theme drags....and drags....and drags. I think the director, actors, DP and audience deserved a better script wrapped around this story."
3,"It's all about a scenario, no story, still good acting","All characters acted very well, and script was well written. However, it's unlike most common movies, since it did not actually have any specific story or heroes or heroines. Overall an enjoyable experience, but on the verge of being like a documentary.You will enjoy it if you have slight interest about the life running on numbers in Wall Street."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping to see something that happened behind the scenes. The truth is that for anyone who has good knowledge of happened in the financial crisis, this is almost like a deja-vu. Almost nothing new.So maybe this movie was about the characters? I also found them bland and forgettable. The dialogues are forceful, contrived and unrealistic. I am not sure if it is Hollywood or the actors. But no American movie was ever successful in capturing the corporate work environment. You may be thinking about ""Office Space"". No. That doesn't count."
5,The 2008 Crash Movie for Dummies!,"Simple and sweet, this movie sums up the stock market/real estate crash into a 2 hour riveting lesson of our current business models and lack or moral compass. A must see, and top notch performances!"
5,Best CPA Movie,One of the best accounting movies I have ever seen. Goes into the shoes of an investment banker. A must watch for anyone who is pursuing a career in Wall Street. Good director. Best finance movie out there. Leaves Wall Street Money Never Sleeps in the dark :P
5,Margin Call,"I got the DVD very quickly and I always love when it just fits in my mailbox so no fuss with getting it right away. I saw this movie in the theatre and thought it was awesome. If you are curious about how did our financial mess happen, this movie is one for you."
3,Market Crash - From the inside just before it happens.,"This movie succeeds in getting the viewer to feel what it's like to be regarded as nothing more than a disposable drone at every level of the corporate ladder including the top. Reminds me of a pre-employment policy statement of a major bank I once read; Basically it said if your ""lucky"" enough to be hired, your tenure will literally be on a day-to-day basis no matter how talented you are, and you'll be expected to exceed all previouly set levels of productivity and profitability while maintaining the highest levels of ethics and morals. - LMAO!!!"
3,Keeps you hanging on the edge,"This was a good movie. It has a lot of character interactions, and makes one think about the ethics and what is right and wrong."
2,BD has mastering error,"Film: *****BD: **The Blu Ray has not been properly mastered. The black level is all wrong and often way too high, resulting in milky images and gray opening credits. It did not look like that in the cinema."
1,"Slow, boring, un-insightful",Pretty much lame all around. Kevin Spacey is no longer an indicator that a film will be good. Don't watch this thinking you will learn anything about the financial crisis. Listen to the planet money podcast and then go watch something entertaining.
1,Don't waste your time! So tedious and boring.,"How could the word ""thriller"" appear in the description of this movie??? This was one of the worst movies I've seen in the past 12 months. It was so slow and tedious. And just when the movie could have started to get good, it just ends.What a waste of some incredibly acting talent!"
3,Decent if you're somewhat bored,"This is a good movie, but its all too self contained. Everything happens within a falling investment bank, theres little contact with the outside world, which is the point of the movie, but also something of a failing. This would be an excellent first part of a trilogy. Its very good, but it might leave you wanting much more."
2,So disappointing...,I was really looking forward to this after reading reviews in the NY Times & other places. But one more time I got set up. I think I've been spoiled for inside looks at the workings of contemporary business by The Social Network. Where is the excitement in Margin Call? Where's the energy that has gotten these people to the precipice they're about to tumble off? The characters in this movie are so generic they could have walked out of an old Hollywood war horse like Executive Suite. It has a talented crew of actors but I never for a minute got the feeling any of them had a clue about the actual workings of the business they were in. A good part of the blame goes to the lazy script. The higher ups in these firms would have been well aware of the rocket scientists in their ranks because they were the guys hired to invent the very financial instruments that brought it all down. Here they're whiny junior analysts running financial models.
3,Margin Call,"This movie doesnt get to the heart of the matter. It semi gives a hint to part of the problem of what really happend from one perspective. The one to watch is ""Inside Job"". A documentary of epic proportions. Its really too bad that we have a system of corrupt politicians and business leaders running this country."
2,Margin Call - waste of time,"Starts out slow and never got any better. It was boring. Good thing it was a free rental. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. If you work in banking or stocks, then it's a movie for you. Especially if you want to hate Wall Street anymore than we already do. Full of deceit and corruption. A good old boys network only out to protect themselves and line their pockets."
3,"Did the writers not understand what they were writing about, or did they think the audience wouldn't?","I worked on Wall Street in the 1980s, and still enjoy a well done financial drama. I thought the acting was good overall...Kevin Spacey was excellent in his role as the head of a Wall Street fixed income trading floor. But two things really bugged me. These characters were so honest - I can tell you from experience that is NOT realistic. Secondly, the ethereal, vague explanations of the mortgage backed securities and the ambient market conditions that were causing such a fallout -- were they purposely that way because the audience wouldn't understand more details? I found that insulting."
2,Don't waste your time and money,"Don't waste your time or money. The 2 stars are for Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons (my fave actors). Otherwise, it's boring, super slow, no action. It's a complete waste."
1,Unrealized Potential,"Despite a talented cast, the script is awful. The plot is dull, even for a 'based-on-a-true-story.' I wouldn't waste my time with this. If you're interested in '08 market collapse, watch the PBS Frontline, ""Money, Power, and Wall Street."" There is more drama in that documentary than in this drama."
2,"Read the WSJ daily, at least it's more thrilling","I truly feel the actors did a great job within the limitations given them in this movie. There IS a real life plot in this movie, but either the writer/director has no idea how to convey a complicated transaction, or they simply don't know the subject matter at all. I have watched documentaries on Enron more thrilling than this movie. Again, I feel Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, and Zachary Quinto did a fabulous job with their roles. Unfortunately, it has the depth of about an inch, so not much more they could do. I like Kevin Spacey period, but given the option again I would have skipped this one."
2,Slow and Boring,"In contrast to many, I found this movie both slow moving and much of the time just boring. Given the enormity of the subject and the catastrophic events and consequences, how one can make a slow and boring movie alludes me. Far too short of tension. Far too short on reality. Waste of some fine actors...though they did make money I'm sure."
2,Marginal,"It's hard to be sure, but the extremely elliptical dialog here was probably the result of the script writer(s)not really knowing enough about this very complicated subject to say much more about it than they said. The actors had very little to work with; they tried hard, but seemed mostly at a loss as to how to proceed. Some variation in the swearing might have helped; these young men would certainly have had bigger arsenals of curses. Jeremy Irons had the longest speeches, if one could call them that, but he's been hamming it up for so long now that he can chew the scenery without saying a word, and he did that too. A viewer whose taste I respect has praised this film, but that can only be his reaction to the appalling situation that it attempts unsuccessfully to explain, rather than any merits of the film itself. I was looking forward to this one and had hoped to learn from it, or at least be entertained. It was a big disappointment."
1,"This is a review of Amazon Prime Video, Not the movie Margin Call","I've tried to watch MIssion Impossible and Margin Call using the Amazon Prime service. In both cases the film hung up the system after just a few minutes. This is not a high speed streaming system. It delivers clogs and frustration.I watch netflicks, hulu, and dozen others using my roku system. Only Amazon Prime fails to deliver.I thought we'd be getting a huge selection of films and tv shows as well. Not so. Just a few with the option to purchase others.I just don't use Amazon Prime video anymore. Why pay to be frustrated? (BTW I have a very high speed internet connection, way beyond a typical home user.)"
2,"DULL, HEAVY HANDED MORALITY PLAY","LONG, SLOW Movie. BIG Name Cast. ANGST laden plot. Lots of HEAVY PORTENT. Heavy handed morality play that basically put this viewer to sleep."
3,get angry,These guys should be in jail. The actors humanize them. But they came close to destroying the system. And they are still playing the game.
5,Well written and well acted.,"I learned, on a much smaller scale, that working in a downsizing company is not much fun. But this is a larger story best summed up by the discussion between Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons near the end. Are they just part of an imperfect system or do they have a moral responsibility beyond just letting everyone look out for themselves. The one gap in the movie is that the eventual innocent victims of their actions are not visible. The ones who throughout this country and other countries lose their jobs, homes, retirement savings etc. A condition that we are still trying to recover from.This is a very well written script, well paced for a ""corporate"" story. Kevin Spacey was never better and the rest of the cast was also strong."
4,Strong Movie about an Important Topic,"I found this film powerful and totally engrossing. I do not how accurately it portrays what happen t during the 2008 financial meltdown, but the film has prompted me to find out. I will find a good book on the subject or as recommended by another reviewer watch Frontline's ""Money, Power and Wall Street.""The performances were excellent, particularly Jeromy Irons.My only complaint about the movie was its excessive us of profanity, particularly the f-work. I NEVER hear that word used by any of my friends or family, so I object to being 'entertained' by its constant presence. Perhaps the screenwriter felt it was necessary to show the crudeness of Wall Street personal, but he could have found a better way to demonstrate this.I recommend this thought provoking film."
4,No spoiler here!,"This was a really frightening look at how ridiculous high finance has become. EXCELLENT acting. I would have given it a 5 star review, but the ending was somehow lacking. Perhaps because I wanted more. It was very worth the time to watch!"
5,A great see to understand American irrational behavior around money.,"A great movie about the irrational and greedy behavior of people and in this case Wall Street and banks. A must see to go along with the NOVA presentation ""Mind Over Money""."
2,"Good, but less convenient than two-step models","The Bessey angle clamp requires that you align all edges and provide pressure -- all simultaneously -- while you tighten the one clamping handle. It is less convenient than corner clamps with two separate clamping handles to tighten separately. Their large surface area provides solid alignment, even if it also makes these clamps more appropriate for larger tasks (e.g., over one foot per side)."
3,"OK for Right Angles, But Not Always Exact","I used this clamp on 1 inch pine while building a train table for my son. I thought it 'generally' did a good job with right angles, but it wasn't as precise as I had hoped and after using it twice, I switched back to bar clamps for right angles and got better results. It was also tricky to line up two pieces of wood vertically. I'm not sorry that I bought it, but I think it will take some experience to learn how to use it to get perfect right angles. Maybe it's best to use these in pairs depending on the joint. I think I'll get more use out of it on other projects."
1,never got a square clamp,"this particular model is garbage, could not get a true 90 anytime I used them, the manufacturer is reputable but out of four of these clamps not one hase worked, pocket screws or biscuits are better"
2,Sound Excellent but Played as DVD Only; Photography poor,"As an audio-phil, the ""Six-Channel Surround Sound Experience"" is indeed excellent. However, this is not an audio CD, and cannot be simply downloaded onto an MP3 or other player. The DVD visuals are poorly designed photographs/slides that click from one to the next, and are repetitive. Sound is best enjoyed with picture function cancelled. Overall, too short for a DVD: 52 minutes play time."
5,The First Dog,"I love Jan Brett books, and this one was extra special because it was signed by the author. My grand daughter and I love to read this book together and play the story"
4,Great Pourquoi Story,"As with any Jan Brett book, beautiful illustrations for explanation of how dogs became domesticated. Wonderful for teaching while enjoying a nice story with high interest."
1,latin-english dictionary for the use of junior studies by John T. White,My first and only dissapointment in buying from Amazon. I regard this book as a total loss for anybody that has been endowed with nothing less than a perfect vision. Characters are so small that I have been forced to use a magnifying lens to be able to read it. Quality of the book is terrible (not included material covered). I feel totally cheated.
4,Riveting performance,"I saw this moving on television when it first came out and the memory of it has stayed with me. It is a very sensitive treatment of a difficult topic. For those men who find rape funny (alas, there are still some left), this movie should prove very sobering. An emotional workout but worth it. Excellent, sensitive performance by Richard Crenna."
3,If you love Crenna ...,"This is not my favorite Richard Crenna show, but his performance is as great as always. I buy everything he ever did and am never disappointed. He manages to raise a so-so script to a better level."
5,love Richard Crenna,actually was looking for movie with Richard Crenna as he played Detective Janek. Movie arrived in good condition and played well.
2,Prepare to be preached to,"The promo material of the Editorial Review puts forth an excellent premice. Jaded, unsympathetic cop is forced to 'see things from a different perspective after a brutal attack"". The basic idea was good enough to make me buy the dvd. Too bad the movie did not follow through.The opening was so stereotypical that my first thought was ""Uh oh -another bad cop show"". But it was more than that. It was a bad cop show with a message. And the viewer was bashed over the head with that message for the entire film. And just in case the lack of subtlety in the script or the over acting of the traumatized hero does not drive home that message, the scriptwriter summed it all up in two sentences at the end of the film. Which left this viewer rushing for the off button screaming ""I got it already"".The premise was good - the movie was not."
5,Great keepsake,I have one of these for each of my 6 kids. It's such a quick and easy way to remember everything from pregnancy until their first birthday. I especially like the bright and colorful stickers that remind you of some of the milestones you might not want to forget.
1,Misrepresented,"This is what I wrote to New Chapter Recyclying. They want me to remove it. I still haven't received anything in the mail about a refund. I'd really rather have the books.""When I placed this order it was for the ""Welcome to Tyler Series: Now I see they've changed it to ""1 of: Welcome to Tyler Series"". I thought the price was fair for the series, but for ""1 of:""! There isn't one paperback on earth worth $27.95. There was a complete misrepresentation of the product. Even the picture shows the entire series. I'm disappointed and angry."""
3,First time for used,"Was the first time I have ordered used books. So far I am not really impressed, I am on the third book of the series, and someone wrote in it, and the second one was missing pages in the very beginning. It went from page 12 right to page 21. I wish that had been listed so I could have thought more about buying a set that wasn't quite right. Maybe that is why I always buy new."
5,Bosch is it for Rotary Hammers,I've owned an earlier version since 1982. It's taken more abuse than you can imagine. Other brands just don't compare to Bosch's.
5,A fabulous book by a new author,"Lauren's Eyes is a delight. You'll only be disappointed when it's over!Lauren is such a brave and sympathetic heroine, it's easy to cheer for her. Cal is a luscious hero -- sexy as all hell. All the characters are multi-dimensional and contribute to the intrigue. Buy this book. Buy 2 because you'll want a keeper and a ""loaner"" copy."
3,Basic Reference,"This publication was my first purchase on the subject. Laurence Parent gives you a good detailed trail description. The maps though are poor. A problem with most Falcon Guides. For the casual day hiker this book will do, for the explorer, I would look for another book."
1,A huge dissapointment brought on by hack politics,"I read this little volume expecting to find a detailing of the reasons free speech no longer exists in certain sectors of public life where they are neededs most -specifically the universities- and came out thinking ""say what?""In a masterful twist of political showmanship, Shifrin avoids coming to the blunt conclusions necessary for underastanding political life in the universities- that the modern radical left has wipied out the free exhcange of ideas. Essentially, Shiffrin ignored this overpoweringly important subject of dissent because of his own politcal sensibilities. This man reminds me of the essay ""Politics and the English Language"" by Orwell if only because of the artfull skill Shiffrin used to make mincemeat of that basic truth."
1,Beware of this outdated version,"I was required to purchase this out-of-print book for a class. I thought I had found the most recent version on Amazon, but, unfortunately, Amazon did not reveal that this edition was published in 1981. I paid for expedited shipping only to be extremely disappointed. I had to wait an additional week or so to get the most current version from another source. Much wasted time and expense. Incidentally, the most recent version has one of the most poorly compiled indexes I have ever encountered, and this makes finding information unnecessarily difficult."
3,Best if history is not your 'thing'.,"Otherwise, if you've got anything approaching a working knowledge of history and the West in particularyou're read will only add isolated facts here and there on music. There is just not enough theory to justify thepaltry historical offerings. There has got to be something with more depth out there.He who cannot give accountOf the last three thousand yearsRests in darkness inexperiencedthough he lives from day to day. -Goethe*Unless, of course, he has music, spirit, and a good heart and head to play it with!"
2,I guess it sounded like a good idea,"Criticism is most useful when you're familiar enough with the critic to know what the critic's standards are; if you're familiar enough with the critic's sensibility, you can measure his or her judgements against your own, and so know what to accept and what to ignore. In other volumes of this type (David Pringle's ""Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels"" for example), even if you don't know the critic to start with, because every judgement of every book is his, as you work through the book you come to know him, his likes and dislikes, his insights and blind spots, his preferences and prejudices. In this book, however, this is impossible, because the 100 books have been chosen by 100 different authors. It must have sounded like a good idea, but it makes for something of a mess, and I've found the book to be of far less use than Pringle's books on science fiction and fantasy, or the fantasy compilation by James Cawthorne and Michael Moorcock."
2,"should be called-best 100 horror books if you feel like digging very deep into the minds of the characters in them""","crapcrapcrap. i mean come on-ok, this book is sometimes interesting but the books it cites and reviews are not scary. so far at this books suggestion i have read 1. haunting of hill house (decent but not real scary) 2. arabian nightmare-boring as sh%t 3. october country (while this book is the most interesting of the 3-and i still have not read most of it-but what i have read is not scary) and 4. the cellar-interesting to a point but still not scary and the ending is lame. it also mentions salems lot which i read before and wanted to shoot stephen king for being so unbelievably dull(but tried to overcome this by remembering that i loved the shining and rose madder). anyway, not a fan of this book so far."
5,Well executed,"Such list books are often dull, patchy, or smug literary circle-jerks. This one dodges pretty much all the pitfalls to give something you can dip into, use as a shopping list, or read end-to-end as a history of the genre. Nothing will please everybody's taste (R. Chetwynd-Hayes' 'usual pedestrian flippancy' - how dare you sir!) but I don't think you'll come much closer than this. For both veterans and novices to the world of literary horror, this is highly a rewarding read."
4,OMG!,What is going to become of Damali will she be able to fight off the vamp virus? Will her and Rivera produce day walkers? Will the holy key ever be found? will rivera do the right thing if he's the one to recover the key from the rogue master vamp who stole it to create an eternal night? these are just some of the questions that had me on edge while reading this book. i hope this series goes way past the wicked which is the last book i have for this series. LA Banks is a wonderful writer and i'm glad i was told about her books.
1,Slow!,"Couldn't even get into this book, only read one chapter if that. It did not hold my interest at all."
5,Different twist,"I enjoyed this book. It was refreshingly different. Each story follows the good vs. evil theme, yet maintains an individuality that is uncommon in a series. I was fascinated with the concept of seven levels of heaven and hell."
2,The Book is Ok,"The book, and the worlds created within the book are all very interesting. My major problem with this book is the colloquial language used throughout it that made the writing feel forced and just painful to read. I understand some ""culture"" is supposed to be infusing this book, but please the amount of slang used throughout this book is ridiculous and makes it difficult to get into the plot and enjoy the story. I really like the entire story line (though Carlos can get a bit much for me) but overall I enjoy the fantasy realms, but the forced slang used almost made me throw the book away."
4,good,4 in one makes this a very worth while product. I like this price for the amount of movies that were on it
5,doris day greatest classics,My favorite or one of my favorite movies of doris day is calamity jane. She has a great performance. Love it
5,Just what I needed.,I needed a small pouch to hold my new digital phone at work. This item fit the bill perfectly.
4,"Interesting history in book, some songs sound alike","The book gives you a history of the Navajo people and customs, and their role in their lives. Much of the book concerns the woman who sang the songs on the CD, Marilyn Help,and her life as well as her reasons for the songs, most of which are not old but which she feels tell some story or teach a lesson. The last song, Go My Son, is the only one in English and is about the importance of gaining an education in todays world, another song, Kiizh (Spot)is a childrens song with a melody very recognizably based on a couple of nursery rhymes we've all heard. In the appendixes you'll find listings of pronunciation (translations of songs on the accompanying CD are within the revelant chapters), movements to perform while singing each song and bibliographies of books, recordings and a few videos. Not a great book/CD for the casual reader or listener but very interesting for those who know the people or the area."
3,Consistency isn't the same,"I purchased this in late Oct and thoroughly enjoyed it. I quickly ordered 2 more packages in early November and received what was absolutely disgusting and tasteless. I can say the consistency isn't always the same, so beware. I've been quite satisfied with Sea's Gift which I would highly recommend to everyone."
3,Eh,"It tastes ""weird"" and not in a good way. Like fish-tankish...There was tons of it...luckily my dogs love it, so I don't have to throw it away, and they get the minerals. I usually buy Sea's Gift. I tried Amy Chung's and it was waaaay too salty. I went back to Sea's Gift toasted and that's what I am sticking to."
1,fish smelling styrofoam,"Based on the previous review and some web searches this sounded like an ideal product to replace salted peanuts, chips, whatever as a snack. I took one bite from a packet and forced myself to chew the styrofoamy like texture and rotten off-fish smell. Later that day I tried to see if my dogs would eat them and got nauseous opening a packet for them. No, they were smarter than me and just sniffed them and walked away. This product may be wonderful for your health but I hope there is a tasteless pill that can do the same thing if we have to get health from this. So if someone likes this stuff I have 198 packets that I would be willing to send free of charge to the first one to email me via amazon."
1,Misleading Product Informations,"This is a product of China, not Japan. It contains 3 strips per packet, not 4. It has 90g which is 3.17oz, not 3.4oz.It tastes great but the information is bad."
2,Ok,"I don't really like these. I really like Annie's and Trader Joe's dried seaweed and was looking for a cheaper alternative, but this is not it. It is not salty nor crunchy enough."
2,Not as tasty as others we have purchased,"We've bought and enjoyed similar products before, but this one was not as tasty. My wife blames lack of sesame seeds; I just say it ""tastes funny."" She is slowly eating them, but I predict we won't finish it. Fortunately, it wasn't very expensive.Your tastebuds may vary, of course."
1,Seaweed,"We were expecting this would be the same as Trader Joe's seaweed, but definitely not the same stuff. Very sweet and odd taste."
2,"If you've never had seaweed snacks before, you might enjoy this.","As a frequent buyer of Sea's Gift Roasted Seaweed Snack wasabi flavor, this seaweed had an appealing price so I thought I'd try it. However, I was quite disappointed with the flavor once I tried it. I have 99 packs remaining and hope to find someone who I can give them to."
3,Don't like packaging,"Annie Chuns is the best; Sea's gift the next best and Ajitsuke last. Annie chuns is too expensive because I eat a lot of seaweed for snacks. I'm on a diet. I don't like these individual packs because I ended up with dark green flakes all over my clothes since the strips are so fragile. And they don't brush off if it's a sweater. I do like the spice in them. Kids probably can't eat these very well because you have to be careful opening them so they don't completely fall apart. So, I ordered Sea's Gift again after trying these out."
3,"Not bad, not great","Decent tasting seaweed. I have several Korean friends who have prepared Korean meals for me, often including seaweed. I tried this hoping it would be the same thing. It tastes decent, but not as good as what I am used to, and not as crunchy as some of the other stuff I have tried. My biggest frustration is the packaging. If you are trying to eat a few packets in the car, the numerous small packets leave a lot of extremely light/thin plastic that won't just stay in a cup holder or other trash holder.Pros: Good price, large quantity, fairly good tasteCons: Packet size (trash left after opening)"
2,Unpleasant,"Unpleasant taste, very fishy. Clearly low quality. Ate one and am eager to give away the rest to someone! I did get the product promised, but the taste was really unpalatable. Also didn't seem very fresh."
2,Good concept but.........,I ordered these seaweed snacks thinking it was a neat idea with the packaging making it easier to take to work and munch on but not sure if my item was old or packaging compromised but it tasted old wasn't crisp.
1,Only 3 strips per packet,"I bought this product because 100 packets per bag sounded a good deal. The quality is acceptable but I was disappointed to find only 3 strips inside each of the packets. I buy this type of product often but I have never seen a 3-strip package. it usually comes with 4~5 strips per packet. Also the product feature says ""Product of Japan"" but this is made in China and imported by a company in Tiwan. Did I get a wrong product?"
2,THE $ PRICE $ IS RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I saw this movie on TV a few times it gets 5 STARS ""THE MOVIE"" but the PRICE for this DVD item & what its going for on AMAZON is PURE CRAZY! I saw the price and had to do a quick GOOGLE search to see if LITTLE RICHARD was indeed still ALIVE or DEAD! (HE IS ALIVE STILL)!!!!!WHAT IN THE WORLD is the price doing so HIGH? Thats crazy! I wont be paying that kind of money for one DVD. NO WAY! I will burn it off of somebody elses copy, before I pay that type of money for a movie. smdh!"
5,Great!,I was searching for this movie for quite a while and I found one used but not overpriced. That was great and I'm very happy!
4,The Georgia Peach,"I grew up with the music of Little Richard, Fats Domino, Elvis and really never understood the real stories behind these influential rock artists. This made for television movie accurately recreates the life and times of the man who really did put the ""rock""in rock and roll. Although I have only watched a portion of the dvd, I can recommend it to anyone who has any interest in this always fascinating artist who still contributes today: check out his performance on ""Kindred Spirits"", the Johnny Cash tribute album."
2,The reviews were right,"The reviews were right, this CD is a copy of the original bnh CD with the same cuts in a different order. I wish I had bought the CD bnh made with some rappers instead. I am glad to have every possible bnh CD for I think they were one of the greatest un-known bands of the 90s. I have 7 bnh CDs and will buy at least one more."
4,A Walk in the Author's Shoes,"Those enjoying Bowden's work over the years will find this an intriguing glimpse into the author himself. Briefly, he lowers the shield just enough to see the warm blood rise up his neck; a love affair when he was still capable of love, a dying father whose actions - not words - demanded his respect, and a brief return home to put together pieces of life never meant for such borders. If nothing else, buy it for the cover - a brilliant spash of color and shapes that summarize the storyline."
3,It's just a CompactFlash Card port,"For what it is, it works well, and transfers the data from my CompactFlash card in the blink of an eye.It's not what the manufacturer describes, however. It's not a 4-port USB hub, it doesn't come with an AC adapter (doesn't need one to just read/write to a data card), and the attached USB cable is only about a foot long, not the fifty-something inches as in the description.If you're looking for a USB hub, keep looking. If you're looking to save digital camera batteries, and to download your images from the data card faster than your camera-connection would, this is a very inexpensive way to do just that, and only that."
2,Not as advertised,"As stated before, this is not as described. It is only a card reader, period. Works OK, but not as slick as some others and the cord length can be an issue."
3,"Sound great, but fragile and sometimes hard to keep in the ear","These sound great. They sound fantastic. They sound just like Ultimate Ears (because they are, rebranded.). Unfortunately, the break easily. Theres a joint where the cable meets the earbud where you can separate the 2, and it separated in the wrong place. Now its time for fun of a mail-order repair ticket.It also took a while to find the right fit. I had to spend an extra $20 ordering a set of the foam pads as they seem to be the only ones that hold the earbuds in place. The plastic ones kept slipping out of the ear unless i sat frozen still.The earbuds come with a soft case and a hard case. Use the hard case. Youll also want a headphone extension cable if youre going to be any more than 2 feet from the headphone jack."
4,"Great sound, Can hear all the detail of the music","I have gone through many different headphones. AKG, Sony, Sennheiser, Shure, over the ears and buds and have found these to have the full spectrum of sound from highs to lows that I haven't got from any of the others so far. I also need to reformat my music to a lower compression. The only issue I have had is the fit but I have had that issue with all the in canal ear buds."
3,Cheezy,"The cars are great, Tanner Foust and Paul Tracy are good, the host is cheesy, as is the background music - let us hear these two 1000hp beasts roar! An amusing way to spend 20 minutes if you are a fan of the Mustang GT500 or the Camaro but don't expect too much."
3,an interesting mystery film.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""La Commare Secca"" or ""The Grim Reaper"" is about police in Italy attemptign to solve the murder of a prostitute in Rome. The police track down and interrogate people who were in the park a at the time and they talk about what they saw through a series of flashbacks.The film is based on a story by the late Italian director Pier Pasolini and is well written. It has been compared with Rashamonbased on it's similar plot.Unfortunately, an new interview with the director is the only special feature.This is a good film for someone who enjoyed Rashamon."
3,"Very Entertaining! Comparable to ""Rashomon""","Bernardo Bertolucci is sadly not known for this film. When most people think of him they usually think of ""Last Tango In Paris"" or his Academy Award Winning film, ""The Last Emperor"". But I think it's pretty fair to say, no one thinks of this one. I mean, c'mon, I'm the ONLY person who's writing a review for this movie! But this movie is comparable to Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"". It too also deals with many different people offering their perspective on what happened the night of a murder. Only in this case it's a prostitute who was killed in a park. Bertolucci's directing is amazing in his first film. It displays what kind of filmmaking genius he is! I don't think it's his best film, but it's definitely a movie I wish more people would watch. A wonderful film, that deserves to be better known. Great acting, intriguing storyline, good cimematography, and outstanding directing by Bertolucci. A must for every Bertolucci fan!"
4,Finally a refreshing rock group with new music.,A freind told me about this album and it is the greatest thing to come out in a long time. I hope the record label pushes this one so the group doesn't fade away. From a 47 year old
2,Dissapointed,"Really dissapointed in this one, these are great songs, the band is very talented, 'Hum' is one of the best angst driven rock songs in years, but the production isn't able to keep the other tracks from sounding like the last. Most songs seem more like dragged out ""parts"" of songs. Hum and (maybe) Opportune Moment are the notable exceptions, but they don't make up for the rest of the muddled CD. I'm suprised no one has compared this CD to other new bands like Splender, who suffer the same problems.These guys are very impressive live, but with the exception of Hum, the talent didn't translate well into their album. See them live, and hope the next album is worthy of their efforts."
4,real loud pop,"i heard ""hum"" on a cmj sampler and nearly choked on my ramen. what a blast of bracing melody, guitar and great howling vocals. the songs are uncomplicated and not riffy in a way that a lot of ""guitar"" records are, with simple, drawn out melodies delivered full throttle by the singer guy. i keep reminding myself that this far from the most original thing i've heard...and then throw it on again, and crank it like im 16 again. i'm not."
2,Throat Depth Counts!,"I wasted money on this clamp because the description didn't mention the throat depth. I needed to clamp a 3"" ear to the top of cabinet sides thus making the toe kick by overhanging the cabinet top. This clamp looked to be perfect, but the throat depth was about an inch shy. The side grabbers wouldn't reach past the ear to grasp the cabinet edge.The clamp would be OK for edge banding, but if you are doing anything else, be sure to check the required throat depth"
3,Helps but with a major caviat,"The adapter appeared to work fine without installing any software. Just connect it to the USB port on your computer, connect the PS/2 keyboard and mouse and you are good to go.The big but comes from the fact that if you hold the Shift, Alt, or Ctrl keys for more than 3 seconds, you would 'lose' them: so if you want to save a file using the Shift-S shortcut, and you held the Shift key for too long - you are only going to see the letter 's' added instead of having the file saved.With USB peripherals being so cheap, skip this adapter."
3,"Dependable, but slow for some","I have used this product for years with my old and comfortable keyboards. Unfortunately, this adapter does not allow you to program the repetition-rate when you hold down a key, and I find the repetition rate rather slow (I prefer to use the fastest speed). People who use the keyboard extensively to navigate through documents using the cursor keys will find this quite annoying. Otherwise, it's a nice, dependable, durable cable."
4,Works well on XP Pro SP2,"For XP to recognize the adapter properly the first time, it seems I had to plug in both keyboard and mouse into the adapter before plugging the adapter into the USB port. After that ""initialization"" step, it was recognized each following time even though no PS/2 device was plugged in. This was a minor complaint for me, and may be inconvenient for others who only have one input device available.I did not have any issues with XP thinking I released shift, alt, or ctrl while I was still holding down those keys (even for 10 seconds or more). Character repeat seemed to work ok too, though I didn't test this very much.My mouse was a USB Logitech optical with an adapter to PS/2. My keyboard had a 5-pin DIN adapted to PS/2. There were no problems even with each device having its own adapter to PS/2.Overall, I am pleased with this adapter."
4,Wrong one,this product i ordered was the wrong one for what i was looking for my PC...i decided it would be a pain to send it back and costly...it was my fault for buying the wrong one..if it had been the right item..it would of worked perfectly...ty
2,Neutra book,Was disappointed with the quality- the cover of the book was damaged where the lettering on the N of Neutra was not filled in properly.
2,not as presented,"The issue was with Stork Media. They provided the book 7 days late. The book appeared used on reciept and they charged a 20% restocking fee. They said that many people assume the 2 days shipping from Amazon applies to them and it does not. So buyer beware, find out where the book you order is coming from and if it is Stork Media, well think twice and ask them the rules that apply to them."
4,Large & Unweildy but substantively excellent,"This book is huge and heavy and hard to hold, but is the ultimate collection of photos (mostly B/W) and descriptions of Neutra and his work. It's written in 3 languages, which means that a lot of the volume of the book (2/3 of the text) is wasted space, though the book is easily 50% photos. A detailed (roughly 15% of the book) nontechinical history, light bio, and analysis is included at the beginning, which is well written for a mass audience (ie, you dont need to be an architect to understand it). There is little to criticize. If you are reading the reviews for this book, that means you are looking for a book on Neutra specifically, and you aren't going to do much better than this."
2,On the other hand..,"I could not have been more disappointed with this book! The suggestions for quotes to use in toasts for various occasions were uninteresting and unoriginal. You could find many more memorable words and phrases to borrow in a host of other books. Do the authors really think that ""may we be loved by those we love"" would add wit or class to a toast at a family occasion? Pass this book by and find another to help you in expressing yourself glass in hand."
4,A good choice,"I did not know all the tunes when I have ordered this CD and after listening, there are still some tunes that I do not know. However, the quality of recording is excellent, the choice of tunes is interesting and the orchestration is good. So, if you know these tunes and if you like them, you may buy this CD; it is not a bad one. It is not the one that I prefer because it is a question of personal choice but it is at least a good one."
3,Tips from a master printer,"Dodging, toning and related topics for the advanced printer. Skips basic lessons on the orginal print process and delves right into advaced techniques; superb in this regard. Split contrast printing delt with in detail. If you wish to use VC papers this book would be a good investment, as he teaches a printer some really crafty tricks in this area (such as using a #1 filter to burn-in clouds while using a #3 or 4 filter for the rest of the exposure). Great for fine art printers everywhere."
1,Not broad enough in scope...,"I was disappointed in this book because I had expected useful information and techniques. The photographs chosen do not seem to convey much and the ""technical"" explanations of the manipulations involved to utilize the characteristics of variable contrast papers do not (for me) illuminate the process at all! In fairness to the author my dissatisfaction may well stem from the fact that I quite simply do not relate to his photographic style and fail to see anything here worthy of emulation."
2,Detailed but disappointing book on use of VC papers w/B&W,"I am an avid B&W photographer who does all my own darkroom work. i have many books on the science/art of B&W and use VC papers (FB and RC) exclusively. I looked forward to reading Eddie Ephraum's treatment of this with great anticipation. Yet I was, overall, disappointed. Frankly I am not impressed by his work anyway which I am sure contributed to my feelings in this regard. This book is useful if you are an avid toner and want another perspective on the issue, but overall my two star rating is generous!"
4,Make sure you have a wrench!,"We received these in plenty of time for the birthday party at the rink. Cool! All went well. The fit and look were good for my 8 year old boy. Following about 3 separate skating sessions, the front wheels fell off. No injury. Just need to check the tightness of the nut before going for a skate."
2,OK,"This is OK. It has some creative drills, however some of the concepts they show are not sound hockey practices. Worth getting, but don't take everything presented to heart."
5,Best book for teaching statistics to criminologists,"This is an absolutely wonderful book to work with when teaching statistics to a public that doesn't like statistics... the examples bring the material alive, the explanations are deep and clear, and, when taught skillfully, one can be pretty confident that a class following the book will produce people who know the material and can implement it to their criminological research."
3,"Ok, but missing spring compression tool","I got this for my husband. The parts worked ok, however the plastic spring compression tool (seen between the key and actual points in picture was not included in the package. He was able to use the parts but the tool would of made it easier. We kept the package because of not wishing to deal with a return."
2,Bad mix or bad taste?,"Having listened to many DVD-Audio albums now I was sure that the 24-bit encoding of the London Philharmonic recording promised on the jacket was another ticket to a pleasurable listening and orchestral experience. OOPS! Not only were most of the interpretations questionable at best, the bass overwhelmed the system and was completely out of sync with the rest of the mix. The separation was muddy, and the execution of the pieces stilted at best. This is one of those times you don't want to buy a compilation DVD-Audio. Stick with the conductors and orchestras that specialize in some composers and their works and look carefully at the Silverline label."
5,Great deal,This was a great deal and shipping was fast. I needed this part to replace the OEM part. Well built and works great. Easy to install. Shouldn't take more that 45 mins.
5,For aspiring writers looking to flex their creative muscles,"Nonstandardized Quests: 500+ Writing Prompts That Matter by highschool English teacher David E. LeCount is an invaluable aide for creative writing teachers. Nonstandardized Quests is packed cover to cover with ideas for unusual writing assignments meant to get young people to think and put effort into expressing themselves. Each topic (such as ""a guidebook for horses on how to get along with flies"") has a corresponding website for research, and samples of student writings intersperse the abundant ideas. Nonstandardized Quests is also useful and highly recommended for aspiring writers looking to flex their creative muscles via self-administered mini-projects."
5,Bath bench review,Product is one of few all plastic bath chairs with adjustable legs. Easy to clean. No arms makes it easy to transfer in and out. Was timely delivered.
5,Excellent Bath Chair,Purchased for my Mother-in-Law who loves the sturdiness of the chair. Her caregiver is happy with it as well. I would recommend this product
4,Wonderful!,Wonderful chair for our newly renovated shower. Now we won't have to fall over trying to wash our feet! Shipped quickly and as described! Would buy again! No metal to rust either!
5,"Great item, great price","I ordered this from my Rehab center as it is the one that the therapist advised as a good shower chair. It is perfect, when notusing it in the shower(after it dries) I used it in my room as a chair to used for various things."
5,Excellent product,"This product has done wonders for my disabled wife. For a long time, she was afraid to take a shower, for fear of a fall. with this product, now I have to fight with her just so I can take one."
1,Bad chair,"Recovering from surgery and could never use it because one of the legs wouldn't stay on. As soon as I can drive, returning item."
5,Perfect!,"The chair is perfect for my 87 year old mother. The chair is sturdy and has enabled Mom to take a shower without fear of falling. It is well constructed, easy to assemble. The legs can even be raised which makes it even easier to get up and down. Excellent product!"
5,Very useful,I don't know how I took showers before I had this. It is very durable and extremely useful.
5,ESTAMOS ENCANTADOS,"NOS HA SERVIDO BASTANTE ESTA MUY COMODA, MUY AMPLIA Y ES MUY RESISTENTE LE HEMOS DADO MUCHO USO Y HA SOPORTADO"
5,Worth Every Penny!!!,I needed a shower chair when I broke my ankle. I had tried a different chair and didn't feel safe because it was kind of flimsy. Then I purchased this chair. It was super easy to assemble...and the handle in the back of the chair made it easy for me to carry it to the shower even though I was on crutches. This chair is worth every penny! It doesn't slip or slide in the bathtub....it is very sturdy...and I felt completely safe!
5,Great Shower Chair,"My wife has a balance problem which comes and goes. We got her this chair so she could sit while she took a shower. She loves this chair and it helps her to shower without worrying about her balance. Although it is light weight, this seat is wide, has a backrest and is sturdy."
5,bath tub chair,"Good solid chair, doesn't slip or slide. I especially like the feet on the legs. Very easy to put together, no tools needed. I would highly recommend this chair."
5,Good choice!,This was exactly what I needed for my husband in the shower--i loved being able to take it apart for storage. My sister is using it now for my brother-in law
4,"Good Vacuum, but short on accessories","I've been using this vacuum for about two months now and am generally pleased with it. It's sufficiently powerful, very quiet, and seems generally to be well-built. It does not come with an upholstery brush or other fairly standard attachments, and because the hose size is a bit different from the standard shopvac, one cannot just go down to Home Depot and pick up attachments. Instead, it is necessary to purchase the rather expensive Fein attachment pack -- sort of a drag given the rather high price tag of the unit itself. Overall a good unit, but not perfect."
2,hard to complete the set,"First even though this is a wet/dry vac, amazon.com does not carry the accessories necessary to use as a wet vac. So, you'll have to search around to find the wet filter and you probably won't find it easily.Second, the other Fein vacuums are much quieter. The Turbo II and Turbo II at 57 dB make 1/4 the noise of this one. Sure they are more expensive, but probably worth it.I wish I had saved all the packing before finding out that this is really just a basic well made DRY vac. Spend a little more and check out the other models from Fein."
3,Quieter...but....,"I was definitely attracted to this vac for its quietness, and yes, it is quieter than my Sears wet/dry...but, the quietness comes at a noticeable reduction in suction power. With the reduced suction power, you also find yourself cleaning the filter more often. I really miss my onboard ""tool"" storage for the other cleaning accessories...the Fein while compact, lightweight and well balanced is not designed to hold its own accessories, which I think is a must for any tool. I think I have already misplaced an accessory or two...On the plus side it has an excellent quality hose (though the narrow diameter limits what you can pick up with the vac)the longer length hose is welcome but is difficult to store (maybe some velcro strips...)the unit is light and very well balanced, and yes, it is quieter than your average shop vac. I won't be getting rid of my old Craftsman any time soon."
5,The Many Waters,"The Many Waters by Lauretta LueckNot being a Bible fan, I can appreciate the fact that Lauretta with a Baptist background, really did her homework. Her research into many of the `old' historical documents, the interpretations she gives of all the bible verses quoted, are great and in detail. It was very interesting reading about how we and others came to be on Earth, through the ages. Even skipping all the Bible verses, I could understand her truths easily. She has no compunction even about mentioning reincarnation. A must read for those wondering how the big bang came about."
4,Misleading!,"I ordered this product from Set 4 Baby and was under the impression I would receive 2 books since there are 2 books shown. Plus I could order a book plus markers from another sight for the same price, so why would I assume I'm only getting 1 book. Well, even though the add shows 2 books, you only receive 1. When I complained about this, they responded that they show 2 books to show that there are numerous colors the product may come in. SCAM! Why wouldn't you just state somewhere that the product may be different than the one shown? So.... DO NOT ORDER FROM SET 4 BABY!!!! The product itself is nice, the company that sent it... not so nice. Go somewhere else!"
3,Shipper did not acurately reflect product,"I did not receive the item featured. I thought I was purchasing what was pictured. What I received was a girl version (does not go over well with boys). Not worth returning. Love the product, but shipper should at least note that items vary and might not be as pictured!"
3,It's OK,"These books don't leave a lot of room for creativity. You can't color outside the lines, for example. Great concept, just needs improving."
5,Grandson loves this toy,"I bought this for my 1.5 yr old grandson and had it shipped directly to him, so i never personally saw the item. My daughter in law however, tells me that she and my grandson absolutely love it. She because it means no more crayons on the walls, he loves it and it keeps him occupied. I highly recommend this product."
4,A entertaining book !,"Whether you are looking for a breezy bed time bookor a serious trivia read, Bar Games entertains thereader with its funny graphics, trivia lists and aquestion on every page.I learned more about the offensive lineman ofpolitics, the Vice Presidents of the United States,from Bar Games than I did in twelve years ofschool.For the serious NTN trivia player, studying thesection about British royalty in BAR GAMES will enable you to answer these frequently asked questions quickly."
4,Entertaining and Informative,"BAR GAMES , a guide to playing NTN and Megatouch,contains many pages of entertaining trivia toaid the player in achieving a high score when playingNTN trivia or Megatouch.Before buying , look at page 32 , listing the wives ofHenry VIII. Witty and informational!Or page 24, about US Presidents and Mrs. JK Polk's rule on drinking in the White House.BAR GAMES is a very entertaining book."
2,Not Just for Bars,I prefer conversation to games while eating and I don't frequent bars but nevertheless I have a great time with this book. My grandsons love it. We play the games at home and get inspired to make up some of our own. It's simple to correct the few errors. No bother there. The simple questions get us fired up to do further research which is a great learning tool.I find it the necessary light entertainment after a day of heavy policy issues. In fact the kids feel the same. It is much more fun than homework and something adults and children can play together.Enjoy it. I do.
2,Not the same,"NOT the same as the ""old"" Realities! I was so excited to find it,I bought 2, and it is ok, but should have another name. I am in mourning over loss of a great perfume!"
3,"Excellent Arrangement, but No DVD-Audio","I was disappointed when I bought the disk, because it said DVD-Audio in the description and there is no DVD-Audio on the disk. The disk even has 24Bits written of the cover with full descriptions of DVD-Audio in the booklet. Outside of that the arrangement is excellent, and the DTS/Dolby Digital versions are quite pleasing to listen to."
3,Reading instructions,"I have this thermometer. Unfortunately, it comes with no reading instructions. Assuming that it works the same as theATI Aquarium Thermometer, the following instructions may be helpful:""Read temperature as follows: Green = exact temperature Tan/Red = one degree lower Blue/Violet = temperature higher than shown. If no reading appears, the temperature of the water has exceeded the thermometer range (hot or cold). Immediately check (feel water): Is the heater malfunctioning?""Based upon those instructions, the thermometer as pictured would be reading 21 degrees C [20 degrees is blue, 22 degrees is tan, so it's in between those two]."
2,Iffy,"I personally don't like these thermometers. I got this one when I bought a tank. It's not all that easy to read. Sometimes, three bars are colored, making you wonder ""Which one is the right temperature?"" It doesn't have a very high range, either. I suggest a real thermometer. They're easier to read and come in huge scales. What happens if you heater overworks and the tank is at 100 degrees? You can't tell. It happened to me before, and let me tell you, it was horrible. Like I said, don't get this one. Use the $2 you'd spend on this one to buy a real thermometer. Bigger range, easier to read, and comes at about the same price."
3,This is good and has a great nature,"Soul taker overall is pretty darn good. However dont feel bad if u are confused by the first few episodes. Overall things do pick up and it becomes very cool and worth watching. If you like horror, science ficion and mystery, this is the anime for you."
3,"So much, it's hard to handle","This show is above average. As an action anime, it doesn't cut it, but the visuals and characters make this seris. The backgrounds and colors stand out and remind of an Art Nuvoue feel. The characters are unique, and even though you only know then for a short time, you tend to care about what happens to them.The pacing is fast though. This is a show that needs to be watched a second time before the details are made clear, but it's still worth buying. This show spawned Komugi Nakahara, and if you have ever seen Nurse Witch Komugi, this is the precursor."
1,This DVD [stinks] so bad,"I bought this DVD after seeing a couple of the previous reviewers giving it a 5/5. Anyway I must tell you DO NOT BUY this DVD. The plot is so messed up it's not even funny. The animation is ok I guess. But the story [stinks], it's one of those anime that starts out fast paced with you not knowing who the main characters are and so on. Now most of the time when this is done in anime you would gradually get what's going on. But I'm sorry to say in this one I swear I was trying to grasp what was going on but was so lost. The fight scenes were awful. I stopped watching into the first episode (it was that bad). Trust me don't spend your money on this title."
1,"good animation, but nothing else.","Well, I just got finished watching, The Soultaker: The Monster Within, and well they definately have the animation aspect down, but to make a truly good animation it takes more than just good animators. First of all the voice acting and the dialogue were awful. They really need to get some better writers, and get an entire new cast of voice actors. Second, the music was laughable, I haven't heard anything that bad since, well...I can't remember the last time I heard music that bad. And I can't forget about the mad scientist, I mean aren't mad scientists just a little played out by now? So if you are just looking for some eye candy, then Soultaker is the anime for you, but if you want good music, voice acting, and a coherent story line, look else where, in fact I would recommend Boogiepop Phantom or Lain."
5,Confusing but great!,"The very first episode might be very confusing, but the second and third ones are better because then the creators sorta half explain what happened in a weird twisted sort of way. Also, in the credits, I've recognized the Japanese voice actor of Duo from Gundam Wing and the American voice actor of Quatre of Gundam Wing(Kyosuke's voice). I love this series, the animation is great and it has a plotline that actually make a person think!"
4,"I've seen the whole series. Its a good story, actually.","Well where to begin... I have a friend from japan who is very cool. He sends me all the new anime. A long time ago he sent me soultaker and at first I thought it [stinks].The animation was weird and seeing as I speek no japanese I had no idea what was going on. By the way i loved the music.When I next talked with my friend he explained what the hel.l these people were saying. The story is actually a really unique one. A virus and a very messed up family, I mean I never saw shiro being the VPs Brother. oops dont wanna give anything away. Anyhow the animation is actually great if you look at it from an artistic point of veiw. Its not like a lot of anime it holds a very distinct stile.So its not perfect but its ok. And seeing as you cant really dis the story if you can get past the unusual animation its flawless. Just see the end. WOW."
3,Not That Terrible,"I enjoyed this book much more than some of the previous ones. I found that the antics weren't quite as slapstick. Yes, it still is little farcical, but I found the stunts a little more funny, and Abby a little less caustic. This series is really ""fluff"" reading, but it can be enjoyable. Some of the characters are worth reading the books for. My favourite is CJ. Although we don't see as much of her as in previous books, she is still there and just as confused and funny as usual. In this book Abby is hosting a Halloween party to warm her new home. At the end of the party, though a body is found in a suit of armour in Abby's house, and that body is none other than her arch rival - her ex Buford's silicone-enhanced wife Tweety. Abby has to do some fast sleuthing to remove suspicion from herself for this one. Who has a better motive than her, and the killing is done in her own house. Along the way we get a lesson in medieval suits of armour. Not a bad lark."
3,not bad,"This does its job well, but there are a few drawbacks. It is a bit small for the window, so I have had to ""McGyver"" it to make it fit better. And it gets a bit flimsy after being exposed to the sun for a few weeks, so reinforcement is sometimes needed. But it keeps the car cooler and does its job well. And the price is right. If you are willing to modify/add a little, this is for you."
5,Sliding Towel Rack,"This is a great towel rack for the kitchen and can be used in a multitude of spaces. I have a very old one in my kitchen, polished it up and reinstalled it when we did some remodeling because I couldn't find a new one at local home improvement stores. When my son-in-law expressed interest in it I googled 'sliding towel rack' and presto ~ there it was on Amazon. Ordered it and now they have a shiny new one in their kitchen. And my old one still works great."
3,Be honest on the format you are selling!,"It is all here: a beautiful compilation from the Italian greats, like Vivaldi, Albinoni, and Verdi. But what I find detracting from this respectable, well - orchestrated collection is the fact that it comes in compressed formats, such as Dolby Digital or DTS. There is no true, uncompressed DVD Audio, despite the fact that it is advertised as a DVD Audio disc. For anyone that has heard DVD Audio surround, as opposed to Dolby surround, there is a clear difference. By being clearer in what is being called DVD Audio, I might have better used my purchase to acquire a classical video performance or a real DVD Audio disc, instead of this good compilation but, otherwise, compromised musical format."
2,Thade!,"I am disapointed that people pay about 20 bucks for this toy and his knees do not move,I am sure people do not want him on his horse all the time. He comes off it but his knees are bent and he cant stand.For all the money we pay his knees should move.I thougt this one was the best.The others are great.If you prefer to keep him like that on display fine but if you want to play with this guy off his horse in a fight then this is not the toy for you."
4,Every home should have at least two of these.,"This clamp is the perfect little tool to have around your house when you're building or mending small drawers or chairs. This is not a heavy duty piece, but you can manually tighten it to the point where it damages your object. Its important to remember that it doesnt have cushions and you need to use some kind of wooden or hard rubber spacer to protect the surface of your object."
5,Very good clamps,"I have bought a pair of those bar clamps and can say they are sturdy and well made from the design to the finishing. My only complaint is that their wood handles could be at least a half inch larger in lenght and volume to be more confortable to my hands but do not let it intimidate you. Pricewise and considering their throat lenght, i prefer the Jorgensens instead."
4,Cute,"I like Marianne Stillings, I really do. She manages to take romance novels and actually incorporate pretty decent detective work with hot cops and steamy love scenes. For someone who can honestly say she has never read a real romance novel, I found this trio actually entertaining light reading. My only question for Ms. Stillings is - do Soldier and Taylor have an extra brother hanging around for me???"
2,"dull with no passion, maybe just me?","When I saw the set list for this DVD, I thought this would be golden. Instead it was as I remember seeing them live in 92, kind of bland. I enjoy listening to their albums, but Dinosaur Jr. live lacks energy. I was excited when they started playing Chunks, but Lou had no aggression, sure it is 25 years later, but it just sums up what I thought of this performance, bland.The strobe lights in the video are very annoying. It gets old fast and even if you don't have Epilepsy you still might have a seizure.If you are a die hard fan, you might like this much more then I did? I enjoy them and consider myself a fan, but prefer to listen to their albums vs. watching them live.I would have loved to see footage of them in their pinnacle in the late 80's. If this DVD would have been a mix of live shows from years past to present, I think this would have been so much better.Rock on!"
5,Super Great DVD !!!,"This DVD is brilliant and all Dinosaur Jr fans should own it - from start to finish - great songs with good camera angle's used plus it keeps that raw sound that makes Dinosaur Jr so damn great! the live gig ends with a great cover of The Cures ""Just Like Heaven"""
4,Family Tree Maker 2006 Collector's Edition,"This Family Tree Maker is very informative and has helped considerably in my searching my family background and relatives. I would recommend this to any one that is interested in starting a Family Tree of their own. With the help of research using the 2006 Family Tree Maker plus going to the library, I have so far tracked my family's history back to the 1800's. You would be surprised what you can learn and how much fun you can have also."
1,short life,I have owned two of these the 5.0 and 5.5 neither one lasted more than a month past the short warranty. They did work but they weren't idiot proof. Part of the problem was the switch on the face of the unit. How hard you pressed on the switch would affect its calibration for finding studs etc. I would positively look elseware. I presently own a Stanley which is more accurate and longer lived.
1,Very limited use device,"When this product came out I was hopeful that it would be more useful than its predecessors. Unfortunately, it seems to have the same problems and limitations, specifically:1. It is only accurate on single layer drywall covering wood frame construction with either no insulation, or batt insulation that does not have a foil face.2. It does not work on surfaces such as lath & plaster, button board, or covered shear walls. (Surfaces that are present in most homes build pre 1960)3. It appears too sensitive when locating electrical current in walls. This problem makes it impossible to locate studs if they are within a foot or so of electrical current, because the electrical 'alarm' beeps until reset.Definately NOT a buy!"
2,Short life,"It did work for awhile now it's a joke. I've had a few other Zircon tools and they just don't perform. That means live long, work as intended. This trade has its hard knocks, and you'd want to believe for the money you'd get something that would last. I like'd the comment ""30 pictures"" I might do that in a day. I do trim and remodel, and ya gotta hit the stud, not the water pipe next to it (which makes the owner, plumber, painter, and general contractor REAL unhappy). Still looking for the right tool. Glad we have a forum to tell folks about performance."
1,Book riddled with lies and distortions,"I'm really sorry to say this and I hope you don't take offence, but there's only one word in the English language that most precisely describes people like Martyn Gregory: propagandist."
1,Deeply flawed book - authors friends include MI6 spy,"Those who seek the truth should ignore anything Gregory says about Diana/Dodi. Gregory is associated with Dominic Lawson, editor of the Sunday Telegraph, who has been named in the House of Commons as an agent for British intelligence."
2,Disappointing,"As far as Princess Diana books go, this one is as wrongful as you can get ... the reporting is fundamentally flawed. Like the French authorities, Mr Gregory is willing to declare the Earth is flat and more nonsense in the desperate attempt to keep the lid on this cover-up.Judging from statements and the relief expressed by some British politicians, the death was needed to save the throne. Diana and Dodi had become a threat to the British establishment. The scenario opening in front of their horrified eyes was of a possible marriage to an Egyptian playboy. It was unthinkable that the heir to the throne and his younger brother should have a Muslim stepfather. It was equally unthinkable that the union might produce an Anglo/Egyptian half-brother for the royal princes.British Intelligence, under their rules, was ""justified"" in wiping these people out for the purposes of the monarchy, protection of the realm, and ""national security."""
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Stasis end control conflict.An alien that basically wants to do the Overmind thing ends up on Earth, but things don't go as plan, to the tune of him being frozen in stasis for rather a long time.Lone enough to wake up and get involved with a search for his global domination gear with an Earth scientist, a specialist in interspecies communication.Light, short and entertaining book."
4,"A hilarious ""Norn"" Irish rant!",The hilarity and ludicrousness of an obviuosly Irish and extremely unlucky lunatic. A breathtaking journey through places I know (despite the disguises) and people I can relate to . I am not sure whether this makes it funnier or sadder. Either way a worthwhile laugh at another man's dilemma
5,Brilliant writing from Belfast!,"Mr. Bateman has given us in his first novel insight into the human side of the 'Troubles' of Northern Ireland. While the cynical narrative of protagonist Dan Starkey is very entertaining, Mr. Bateman manages to convey both the tragedy and the comedy of living amongst the absurdity of sectarian violence. It should be read by Republican and Unionist alike"
5,beautiful,A gem of a book. I had the good fortune of have met venerable Iyengar and he is such a great being.This book is full of wisdom and wonder.Thanks!
4,A book telling of a journey,I thought this was quite an interesting book of life--the life of B.Y.S. Iyengar. Recommended for those who are real curious.
5,Light on Life,"Being a devotee of Iyengar Yoga, this is an insight into the man and his philosophy on life. It is inspirational, non denominational and a guide for living. I gave this to my daughter as a gift and she was inspired."
4,Yoga philosopy 101,"This is a surprisingly accessible overview of yoga and levels of practice. It is not a ""how to"" manual, but rather a ""why to"" manual with insights for the beginner as well as the experienced."
5,Good marriages make healthy children,"It may not come as a shock to most parents that the lessons our children learn in childhood are carried with them throughout their lives, but what this book makes clear is how our own marriages form a blueprint from which all our children's future relationships will be built. Siegel creates a compelling narrative using lots of case histories and anecdotes, which makes this an easy read. She helps us identify not only what we are doing wrong in our marriage, but what we're doing right, which makes our foibles a lot easier to acknowledge. She also helps us to explore how deeply our own parents' marriage affected us. A very important book with a very important goal--""the opportunity to create a positive legacy of love for our children."""
1,The size & paper quality of a comic book.,"Would not call this version a book. Also too rewritten for my taste. If you want the dumbed down or throw away version, this is it."
3,The photos and the year are its problem,"I read this regular yearly magazine, here in Brazil.This magazine is now a little outdated and its photos are all black & white, at least in inside pages.I also have the annual of this year 2009.Complete(even with some air rifles), correct and very good, but the photos remains all black & white."
1,Can't determine who would use these,I was hoping to get a 'solid' pair of cotton gloves. These are MESH. That's NOT made evident from the description.
1,Self promotion...?,"...Someone ... is praising their own CDs, giving lots of usless and misleading information - the name of the conductor and the performers would be much more appropriate. Not a single serious classical music lover would be even tempted to buy the stuff that they are selling, especially not anyone interested in DVD-A (wich theese titles are NOT). Dolby digital and DTS is NOT DVD-A. Read your manuals folks!"
3,Shelby's Review,"Ben, a six year old boy, can communicate with animals. He lives on Hawk's Hill with his family. One day he wanders away, and then a storm comes. He goes into a badger hole. About an hour after he went in, a female badger comes in, and he becomes friends with the badger. Months Later, Ben gets sick. Will he live? Will he ever see his family again?I think this book was okay. I still recommend this book to all kids that like adventures."
5,This book is fantastic,"This is an excellent book, the perfect combination of excitement and emotion, of suspense and a touching tale of friendship. A book that deserves to be read by all!!"
4,~ BEN AND HAWK'S HILL ~,"This story is about a boy named Benjamin aka Ben, he is 6 years old, and is very little. He likes to go to Hawk's Hill and he follows the animals and mocks them. One day he wandered off to far and was lost. His parents' was looking for him. He was lost for two months. If you are interrested in animals, sounds, and adventure, you'll like this book! I liked when Ben went to Hawk's Hill, because, everyone would think that he was talking/communicating with the animals, but he was realy was just mocking them. It was sad when everybody thought he was weird and crazy just because, he didn't talk to people very often. He's just a normal kid like all of us, exept he's a little small for his age, and he likes animals. You should read this book to see if they'll ever find him. Will Ben survive being missing for so long, or will he die?THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK!!"
5,I really liked this book!,"This book is about a boy who gets trapped by a storm, crawls in a badger's den, and gets adopted by a female badger who has recently lost her pups. In the process he learns about growing up in life. I recommend this book be read by all ages."
5,"A spectacular, thrilling book!!!","This story is a heart warming thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Its about a boy who doesn't fit in and is taken in by a mother badger who has had some misfortunes of her own.I think you should read this book because its so good I wanted my teacher to read it all day.If I had read it I wouldn't have even put it down to go to the bathroom.But if you have a weak stomache I wouldn't recommend it. Please, take my word for it."
4,Grandson Love it,This was for my grandson who has had everyone in the family read it. It's a very enjoyable book. He even had his teachers reading it.
4,Sharlene's Book Review,"In the past there was a boy named Benjamin McDonald a six-year-old boy who lived on Hawk's Hill. Ben can communicate with animals. He can communicate with animals better then he can communicate with people. Ben does not really get along with his dad. One day Ben wanders away and meets a female badger. Then at supper that night he tells his family about it, and his dad tells him to stay away from them. Ben does not like that so he runs away. Will Ben survive? I like this book because it is about animals and people. If you like adventures and animals you will like this book."
3,Tony's Report,"Benjamin MacDonald, a young boy, imitates animals. Ben lives on Hawk's Hill. One day he got lost following a prairie chicken when a storm came, and Ben stumbled into a badger hole. The badger feeds him and protects him. Will Ben be found? I think this book is a great book for people who love adventures. This is the best book and most dangerous book I have ever read."
5,Incident at Hawk's Hill,"Incident at Hawk's Hill was the best book I read this summer. The story goes like this: One day Ben (six-years-old) ran off after a femal badger. He was told not to follow badgers but he did. Finaly the badger came to her hole, but that didn't stop Ben and he squeezed right into the hole. After awile the badger made friends with Ben and adopted him. She started hunting and bringing him food just like he was her baby.Ben's family got conserned about him and sent out a search party and eventualy found him after elevan days of looking for him. When they found him it took his older brother a lot strugguling to get his brother and it took a long time to stop the badger from wrestling him.When Ben got back home he told the story and the next day they went to look for the badger so they could bring it to their house and would let it stay Ben cpould have fun playing with the badger.IT IS A AWESOME BOOK"
2,INcident at Hawks Hill,"This was a very intriging book, that had a very interesting character. It was interesting to see a six year old boy making friends with animals. The only negative thought I have about this book would be it could have used a little bit of edge. I hope to read more books like this in the future. It holds nyour attention great."
4,a boy that can talk to animals!!!!,i think this book is very imaginative and i like that many kids or even adults can read this fabuous book. it is amazing and i could reead it every day!
1,literally the worst book I have ever read,"I read this book at age 12 in English class. It has gone down in history as the worst book ever. Not only is the writing style dry and difficult to understand (especially for children), the descriptions, while probably accurate, are excessively detailed and often pretty gross. The conclusion is disturbing and frightening. The characters are 1 dimensional. I don't see why you would give this book to your child unless you are feeling malicious."
2,America's Demosthenes,"I find Incedent on Hawks's Hill rather pointless. Honestely a kid with an unhealthy affinity for animals gets lost. I got lost in a shopping mall did anyone write a novel on me? NO!! I was cared for by strangers for awhile when that incedent happened. Did anyone consider writeing novel about me NO!! About the only aera the book is well writen in is it's choice of words Eckert shows some eloquence, but not much."
3,Could have been much more...,"Good, intense writing that draws you in with typical MacDonald style - quite an accomplishment when you consider the book was published in 1962. Terrific tale of a sales convention and a sexual liaison and attempted blackmail. MacDonald has managed to make the story almost timeless by careful avoidance of too much detail of cars, locations etc.The book is something of a cop out though - it is too short. MacDonald kills off one of the central characters and brings the story to an end too quickly. I would like to have seen the illicit relationship extended until after the main character returns home and the further complications that would certainly have added. Would have made a more realistic and satisfying story and extended what was a good read..."
5,I am ravenous for more of the same,"Masked Dog kept me racing to finish then disapointed to end. Sex, violence, suspense. What more do you need?"
2,Check your zip code before buying,"I bought this book with great anticipation, having heard it was the ""bible"" of exterior color selection. It may be, if you live in New England or San Francisco. The vast majority of the houses used as examples are Victorian gingerbread, Cape Cod or Colonial. For our California Spanish stucco (an architecture style common in other parts of the country as well), there wasn't a single example that translated.I truly wasn't expecting to see a twin of our house in any book; I WAS expecting recommendations consistent with a much wider range of styles and exterior finishes that would be applicable to far more homeowners across the country, if not around the world. Many of the lovely color schemes that work beautifully on wood would be unattractive and inappropriate on stucco. So pass this by unless the style of your home is the same as the author's bent."
1,excellent,Read the chapter about children who kill. An excellent psychological perspective about how parenting contributes to mental illness. But with a grain of salt.
2,Problems Problems Problems,"I ordered this in hopes of getting it to work with my GPS. Unfortunately, the drivers provided give a blue screen of death on Windows XP Home! Fortunately, I was able to find another source of drivers. If you order this, go to http://tech.prolific.com.tw and look for the PL-2303 USB to Serial Bridge Controller driver. This has solved the problem for me and ended the blue screen on access. (the one I downloaded was wd_pl2303_v20011_v20024.zip). Be aware that you may need to do this to use the device."
1,Does not fit corvette!,Specifically bought for corvette and it doesn't fit. What a piece of junk! I won't be buying anymore k&n products.
2,Not up to usual Mastering Series standards,"Unfortunately, this book is too much 'how I would re-invent JSP' and not enough about how to use JSP. For example, the JSP and Servlet API Reference is just a dump of the the Sun interface without any comments. I tried to get information about the Request object and was very frustrated, since this is scattered throughout the book (I think, the index was not helpfull). I'm sure this has some good code in it, but I didn't buy it to have a code snippets book. I wanted a book that would teach me JSP and be a good reference as I develop code."
5,"Newer, better version now available!","Explore the Virgin Islands IFifth Edition), also available on Amazon.com, is the newer, better version of this title. All the same information plus much more (better photos, better maps, completely updated) and useful tips. Free online updates available."
5,Very Cool,"I guess I am the first person who has actually played it. I must say it is pretty cool. It is very challenging but fun. The music is not bad, but it doesn't need to be perfect. The graphics are very nice and smooth. I love to blow up stuff, just to see the explosions. The levels are very interactive, meaning if you shoot something, it is obliterated. The sound is neat but nothing new. The difficulty level is challenging, but good. One thing that annoys me is that if you don't meet a certain score, than you don't beat the level. You may have to play several levels over and over. All in all, this is not the best fps for gba, but it sure comes close."
1,Complete Fraud,"The description of DVD ""Dream Suite I"" is a total fraud. The description says this is a DVD-Audio that will play in any DVD player or DVD-Audio player. It is no such thing. It is nothing but a standard DVD that plays in a DVD player BUT NOT IN A DVD-A PLAYER. There is a video slide show that accompanies the audio."
2,Ancient Science Fiction,"This book is very difficult to understand, so you'd have to read each story at least twice to understand it, and to tell you the truth it's not worth it. There are a total of 9 stories in the book so you can skip around and read the summaries for each and decide which one you think would interest you. You should probably do what I wish I had done, which is skip around and read whatever story interests you while your still in the bookstore. The story's are so old that its almost like reading ""The Odyssey"" in 9th grade and having to take notes, thats what you'd have to do with this book to understand it. Anyways, I don't think you should waste your money on this book without reading one of its stories to see if you like it or not first."
4,Cover Me!,"I like this album for three reasons. First, for that ol' oh-ga-chuk-a classic ""Hooked on a Feeling"". Secondly, for the ""B"" side of that single , ""Gotta Have Your Love"" because it was so drasticaly different than ""Hooked"" and could have been an ""A"" side on its own. One of my favourite flip sides of all time. Third, for their covers of many of the other songs on the album including ""their cover of covers"" such as ""Working in the Coal Mine"" (also recorded by Devo among others) , ""Never my Love"" ( Addrisi Brothers, 5th Dimension, Association), ""Something's Burning"" (Mac Davis) ""Always Something There to Remind Me"" ( Naked Eyes) and ""Hush"" (Deep Purple). And all of these tunes were done well too. For the different musical styles all incorporated on this one album it's worth a listen. You'll probably end up humming more than oh-ga-chuk-a."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I have to admit that I usually prefer more heavyweight reading like Dickens, Nabakov, and Burgess, but sometimes I squeeze in some lighter fair and am generally disappointed. However, this was not the case with this first book in the Monk series. I have to admit that I am a huge fan of the tv show (more the Bitty-Shram phase than the new bland blonde phase--she makes such a non-impression I can't even remember her name, character or actress)and did not expect much from the book being that it was based on a television show, even if it is an excellent show. All of Monk's usual endearing and not so endearing ticks and foibles are in place, and it is hard to imagine, but his blonde sidekick actually has more depth and interesting characteristics than she does in the television show. I am eagerly looking forward to the next book in the series."
5,The start of a great series!,"As a the Monk TV series, I loved this book. I feel confident in saying that if you are also a fan of the series, you too will enjoy this book.The characterizations of Monk, Natalie, and Stottlemeyer were dead on. It is a blast that the Monk characters, which usually exist in the confines of a 1 hour TV show, can be stretched into a 300 page book!I can't guess what a non-Monk fan would think of this book, but if you like the series - get this book!PROS:Great characterizationsGreat storyNice Romance for NatalieTouching Mother/Daughter stuffTouching scene with Monk and Garbage GuyCONS:Monk ate cereal with milk!At least 3 references to Natalie's small breastsGratuitous references to ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Diagnosis: Murder"" (2 other book series written by this author)Must wait until JULY to get next book!"
3,Mr Monk book not like the show,"I was looking forward to reading the Mr. Monk series as I LOVE the show; however, I was disappointed. The story is told from Natalie's point of view, which doesn't bother me, but she has become somewhat trashy in the story. She's not the clean-cut, sweet girl that I remember from the show. I read mysteries to enjoy the plot but when the main characters are less than heroic, I lose interest. I love this author's version of Murder She Wrote. Jessica is the same sweet, lady in the book as she was in the show. I don't know what happened that he had to make Natalie somewhat sleazy. I'll probably give the series one more try but if it's the same, that will be the last book I purchase."
2,juvenile,"I was so excited to discover these books, and immediately bought one for my Kindle. The story line is good, and if you've seen all the episodes of Monk on tv, as I have, you can readily hear the conversations and tone of voices. But without that as a mental background, it is very juvenile and simplistic writing. Gets a bit tiring and disappointing to have Natalie continually ogling any hot guy who happens by, acting coy and flirty, making snide comments, etc. It seems to be more of a ""teen read"" kind of book than what I was hoping for. Dang!"
4,This book was just funny!,"I have to admit, I never saw the series, I rarely watch TV, so I don't have any ""it's not like the show"", or ""you missed a fact"". I thought this book was just great. Ok, so it isn't War and Peace or Great Expectations (which get a 5 star rating from me), but Mr. Goldberg is definitely a wonderful author, and rolling in the aisles funny."
3,too easy,"this game is too easy .. I finished it in 10h , nice grafik and fun to play in coop, but its too short in my own opinion"
3,working?????,it arrived just like new. the case was great and looked brand new. however the game will only play to the beginning of level three so i cannot finish my game.
4,"baldurs gate review, swapping cash","actually there is a way to swap cash or better yet make unlimited cash, potions, weapons, etc.....but this would be cheating, wouldn't it? I have done this just for the feeling of omnipotence it provides but it certainly rubs against the moral and ethical tenets of true game play. For those who find out how to do it.....enjoy your godhood. Game is excellent...graphics, sound, oppontents(really love those mud slugs)but you better find that special sword before you battle the ultimate foe or you will have troubles out the wazoo. With the sword its a piece of cake. The dicotomy is truly amazing. Bring on the Gate II."
4,Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance Review,"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is an older game, but that doesn't change it's quality. The graphics aren't the best for nowadays, but they are decent. The game-play is where it shines the most. For one to two people(two recommended) you can enjoy a good twelve hours playing an interesting storyline between three choosable characters. Even after you play(or in the middle of the game) You can import your old character and continue with them, so all those levels of experience don't go to waste. Besides a few side quests to add experience and loot, you have to follow the main storyline with very few deviations. The few drawbacks didn't stop me from enjoying this fun game. The game left me wanting to order the second."
4,Awesome must have,"This is a great game me and my wife played it for hours until we beat it. It was alot of fun, controls were easy to learn and the missions are easy to understand(there isn't alot of raoming around wondering what to do or where to go) Single player is good, but two player is so much more fun. This game has a two player maximum. Me and my wife have no complaints."
5,Awesome!,"This ring is not too large but has enough facet and color to give it a good Zing! The price made me a little wary of purchasing it, however the craftsmanship is far above what I could have possibly expected. It is a wonderful ring and the the photos here just don't do it justice"
4,Excellent !!!! A Great Community Policing Tool,"Great use of communication techiques. Police Administrators could also benefit from the insightful information. The format is easy going, Cops will like it. COP Talk fills a void many police officer experince while trying to fullfill thier agency's mission. Every police officer knows that thier best weapon is not thier gun, not thier car or not the uniform; but the ability to communicate. Kudos to the athours and thier thoughtfulness."
5,Bed Riser,This bed risers are very strong and super usefull. I needed extra space to storage stuff and once I bought this item my problem was resolved.
4,"Very good, but not perfect","I won't repeat the praise of others here: it's true that a level that doesn't lose its calibration is wonderful. But I do object to the removable end caps (shock absorbers?) -- they come off in case you want a square corner at the end of the level, but they also come off by themselves, when I find my missing one I'll cement it on. Also, I find the slick handhold-free metal body difficult to grip in certain positions, and the vial you need to see never seems close at hand.These are the trade-offs for the sturdiness and accuracy (which may be in part due to the gentler handling a level that costs this much will usually get ... no more using my level as a hammer in a pinch ... just kidding!)."
4,Missing Something,"A great setup, except the set needs to come with a 30"" level instead of a 32"". The most common dorr size in a house is a 2-6 or 30"". a 24"" level is just too short and a 32"" is just a hair long with the caps removed. These levels are top of the line. A must for all finish carpenters."
2,pre-school....,I thought because it was unavailable perhaps this book was in high demand. I was quite pleased to stumble across it in two book shops this side and had a squizz. It is so basic/ generic. I would get this book for my pre-teen niece or nephew to cut pictures out and prepare a mock presentation for their classmates at school. I guess it is aimed at people who want to know a bit more about Shamanism (what they use what they do) but not at those who want to know how to get into it. I guess on that level it scores quite well. I think five star reviews are a tad much though.I recommend 0754813886 (Journeying to Otherworlds by Will Adcock) which I think is a good intro and gives some basic info on stuff to do to get into it as well. Its cheaper ($10 at time of review) and currently available as well.
2,The Boook of the Shaman; Walk the Ancient Path of the Shaman and Find Inner Peace,"Just got this book. I would not recommend it for any serious seeker of knowledge. It is ok for a small coffee table book. No real meat to the content. Am thankful I got it used as I am very disappointed. Has very little content and some decent pictures. Yes has some ideas of lower, middle and higher levels of existence but one could easily find this info out online in a brief paragraph or two. The word content is probably 25 pages long.I was really looking forward to a book to expand my awareness of Shamanism. This is not it."
5,off the beaten path and delightful,There isn't even one warhorse on this CD. It is filled with lovely musicdelightfully performed.
5,Great for Beginners Too,"I'm just starting ice hockey at the ripe young age of 38. I bought this DVD and the Laura Stamm DVD to help learn skating. While both are excellent, it seems to me that the Stamm DVD is going to be more useful down the line as I pick up more skating experience and comfort. The Glantz DVD I find more helpful in actually teaching the moves/techniques shown in the video; therefore, I find it more helpful for me right now as a beginner."
4,Poetry in Motion,"Very impressive album considering it was produced on a reel -to- reel and Fisher Price mic. Kidding. Actually, this album was very tastefully produced, reminding me that sometimes it's refreshing to hear an actual SONG. Pop culture has over-shadowed all the people trying to reach the Pop culture status. :) I suppose one has to make it before they can sell out. Well Suburban Poetry has crisp, clear vocals, sentimental lyrics, andconscientious instrumentation, offering a welcomed change from whammy dives, thumping, and synthesized abstraction. Suburban Poetry is a respectable way to spend 13 bucks. That'll barely get you in a movie that you'll only see once, and regret seeing at that.A true fan,BRAD"
5,Excellent suggestion for TSO fans!!,"I fondly recall when this album was first released back in 1993. At the time, it seemed revolutionary to me, because it matched classical music by Mozart with modern rock elements of electric guitars, bass, and drums. Nowadays, you can listen to artists such as Trans-Siberian Orchestra (TSO) and find those combinations, but since TSO hadn't organized at that time, it blew me away (and still does). In fact, I would dare to say that this album is the reason I love artists like TSO. Still a classic (no pun intended), and still a WONDERFUL album!"
5,Essential for travel within Dublin City Centre,"One of the handiest maps you can get your hands on! Laminated to get you around Dublin on those ""rare"" rainy days and easy to read so you can find your way back home after a couple of pints. I've used it every time I've been to Dublin, and I'd recommend studying it a bit before you land!"
4,"Great book, full of wisdom.","I was given this as a gift. This book is full of wisdom from elders, and shows the importance of women, something I think women might like to hear, know, or to be reminded of. A great book, and something Important that I have given to a number of women."
5,The series just keeps getting better!,"I've enjoyed watching the Joanna Brady character grow with each book in this series. I'm glad to see she's getting on with her life, and that the other characters in the books are growing too. I was particularily pleased by the changes in Joanna's minister friend, and by the strong relationship Joanna is building with Butch. I recommend this book, but suggest that readers new to the series start with Desert Heat and read through the books chronologically. It's more fun that way to see the changes in Joanna's life!"
4,Outlaw Mountain,"I am both a Joanna Brady fan and a JP Beaumont fan. In the winter rain of Seattle, I especially enjoy letting my mind wander to the heat of Arizona and Sheriff Brady's attempts to keep the peace in Cochise County. JA Jance continues to develop both Joanna Brady and the people who are a part of her daily life. Outlaw Mountain is not just about another murder, but about community and personal issues any of us could face."
1,One of the worst novels I have finished this year,"Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow. It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender. But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd. Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you. It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle. Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time. If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely."
5,Excellent,"Joanna Brady is doing a fine job of being sheriff, raising her daughter and actually finding time to have a life as well. Everyone should be so lucky.Read this one, and all the others, and then go out and find all the JP Beaumont series as well.JA Jance is an excellent writer. Keep up the good work."
3,#7 disappoints,"#7 left me wanting, after thoroughly enjoying #6. Outlaw Mountain was too much too fast on Joanna's personal life. Too much w. Junior. Everything wraps up so awfully easily. Not equal to the satisfying complexity of the Sheriff Brady mysteries I've been thus far enjoying this Summer. I'm not crazy about the suddenly-there, perfect Butch or how quickly Joann's remarrying. It doesn't ring true. I'll go on to Devil's Claw and hope it's better."
3,Layers of Shadow,"A long time fan of Joanna Brady, Outlaw Mountain was a disappointment. Brutal murder, that is solved much to soon while Joanna's personal life takes center stage. Don't we all wish life were easy to deal with as Joanna finds happiness while gaining job confidence and respect of her colleagues.Good light reading while waiting at the airport for a delayed flight, but not up to the complexity of the usual J.A. Jance mystery.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County Novel"
3,Outlaw Mountain,"I enjoyed the story very much. It was compelling and suspenseful with great descriptions and characters. However, in the Kindle version at least, there were so many typos or errors, it was less than enjoyable. I have never read a book with so many typos/spelling errors, and they were very distracting! Where were/are the editors?! I would give the plot, characters and writing four stars, but 0 stars for the editing, which is unfortunate for such a good book. So many typos or errors really impacted my enjoyment of what should have been a fun read. I would like to compare the Kindle version with a print copy to see how the errors compare. Is this common in Kindle versions?"
4,Joanna at her best,"I enjoy reading Jance's series on Joanna Brady, a reluctant county sheriff who has grown in her job. I would suggest you read the series in order because of the character development within the series ! Very entertaining !"
3,"Lots of intertwined plot, but few thrills","This is an unusual mystery. It starts off with an interesting murder, then drags on for a long time. Meanwhile, we slug along through seemingly unconnected events, until finally things begin to focus. I wanted it all to build to a great climax, but it best scene (Joanna vs. the killer) occurred too early, leaving Ms Jance a few more chapters to tie up the other loose ends, such as the missing husband and Junior. There was a lot of good story within this book. Perhaps if it was packaged better, it could be a solid 4 or 5 star mystery, but it has a bit too much soap opera within it. Like all Brady books, it was a pleasant and fast read, however. After reading several of them, though, I still can't figure out the source of antagonism between Joanna and Eleanor."
1,awful,"J.A. Jance's novel, Outlaw Mountain, is one of the worst books i have read in years. Her characters and their dialogue, both inward and spoken, are completely unbelievable. The storyline is convoluted and riddled with useless drama which is completely unnecessary for the plot. The fact that I was able to finish this book was an act of pure discipline. I am a worse person just for having consumed this book. I would advise anyone who is considering purchasing or reading this book to save their time and money."
5,shes still alive. she is a vocal coach.,your address does not work. how can anyone get an answer to yo
5,Wonderful Memories,"My mother and I loved the song ""Don't Say You Don't Remember,"" and I'd love to e-mail Ms. Bremers and share with her what her song has meant to me. She encourages fans to correspond, but her e-mail address is not indicated. Help??!"
2,Long Term Care Planning - Used book sold as new,"I'm very disappointed in the quality of this book cover and it's bent pages. It was sold to me as a new book when in fact, it has stickers on it from being sold at Goodwill for a $1.99 and also at a used book store. It would have been fine if I had been told but I don't appreciate being told that it's new and charged as much as 6 times more than what it was priced at Goodwill or the used bookstore.It also took over a month to deliver it to me. Disappointed!"
5,Cutting Through The Clutter,"It seems that most books about long-term care are either written by someone who really isn't familiar with the subject or by someone with an ulterior motive (i.e. an agent writing a book to boost his credibility to sell a certain product). Marilee's book is different -- it provides an unbiased reference guide for long-term care to help consumers make the best decision for their own personal needs. Thankfully, this book has been finally published."
3,Don't recommend paying the price for only one song on the CD.,I really love the song Step into my World but the rest of the songs I really don't listen to. Wish I could have paid less but CD comes with approx. 40 songs on it.
2,The Xbox version wasn't as good but at least the graphics...,"The NGC version of Wreckless is here. The graphics aren't as good as the Xbox version, and you now have the ability to play 2 players and run over pedestrians. Yay. The only cool thing is the 2p mode w/o split screen. This is cool but a pain in the [butt] because you cannot go too far away from each other.In the end, this game is not very entertaining and at times very frustrating. So just forget it."
3,An okay port of an average Xbox game.,"When Wreckless: the Yakuza Missions first came out on Xbox, there was a lot of hype surorunding it. It was a challenging game with lots of graphical touches. Now, it is out on Gamecube. It is still enjoyable, but nothing above average. The graphical filter which allowed for cool looks like cel-shading or a grainy black and white is nowhere to be found in this port. The controls are great, and it is still challenging, but there are better games on the market. It advertises being able to smash things and run over pedestrians, but if you want violence, go play GRAND THEFT AUTO: VICE CITY instead."
4,Soothing Vocals,"This CD has a typical clubland feel that one would come to expect from 4 Strings. Released currently in Australia are ""Take Me Away"" and ""Diving"", and with the seductive diva on vocals, the smooth acidic synth sounds and a dubbing beat, listeners beware of what the dance world knows as ""formulaic"" music. Worth a listen if vocal techno/house is your style, or if you're a fan of 4 Strings..."
4,"4.5 Stars, Very Melodic vocal eurotrance !","This is a must buy for fans of DJ Encore or fans of the 4 Strings singles. Yes, the songs are very similiar, but that's great if you like the vocal trance sound, which I do. I love this CD and I hope it sells well in the US....it's nice to buy a CD that isn't expensive and doesn't need to be imported from another country."
4,Surprisingly Wonderful,"As a trance fanatic I used to stick my nose up at groups like 4 Strings, finding them too be too commercial for my taste. Boy was I wrong. I recently got this album from a friend and I have not been able to stop listening to 'Take Me Away' or 'Let it Rain'. Both are amazing tracks with a lot of soul and emotion behind them. Put the CD in your car on a long roadtrip and the entire car ride will just fly by. 4 Strings is quality trance music and I recommend this album to all trance snobs everywhere."
5,FANTASTIC,"I JUST GOT THIS CD TODAY, I POPPED IN MY DISCMAN AN INSTANTLY FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. VOCALS ARE WONDERFUL. I PURCHASED THIS CD NEVER HEARING OF THE GROUP AND I AM QUITE PLEASED . IF YOU LIKE LASGO OR SYLVER YOU WILL LOVE 4 STRINGS. CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT RELEASE"
2,Decent at best,"This group, the 4 Strings, is a lot like any other trance group based on a woman's voice (ie: Ian Van Dahl, Lasgo, etc.) And, like all of those groups, have a reputation based on singles, not albums. ""Believe"" proves it.The CD has a handful of good songs. ""Take Me Away"" is a good start for the album, but once you get past ""Diving"", the CD begins to lack it's main appeal.In my own view, techno/trance/dance has to find an artist that can make more than a couple good songs. I have yet to find a good techno album where I can enjoy it the whole way through.If you can find ""Believe"" for under $10, go for it. Any higher and it's a waste."
2,Dated trance,"I have to wonder who's been rating this album up to 4 1/2 stars, because it's mediocre at best, and that's if you're into dated, mid-90's trance music. Does their label have a gorilla marketing team dedicated to twinking the ratings of their artists?As background music it will suffice, but it's no 5 star album. I give it 2 stars because although it's not horrible, it's just rehashing a sounds that's been beat to death."
3,Not so good,"This cd sounds like everything else. It's common dance music. It gets better after #8, but still isn't that good. The only good songs are TAKE ME AWAY, WATERFALL and a couple others don't buy it. It isn't worth it."
1,not an good album,This is not an good album. The songs all sounds the same and the beats are boring and the lyrics are weak. How can she do such an poor album. The vocals are very very weak and bad. Do no buy this album.
2,....a little disappointed,"I must say that when I read the reviews on here I got pretty excited....so excited actually that I decided to buy this CD. I was hoping for a very spectacular dance/trance effort possibly matching other phenomenal trance artists like Alice Deejay, DJ Encore, Fragma or Ian Van Dahl, instead I got something that was mediocre at best... The only stand out tracks on here include ""Take Me Away (Into the Night)"", ""Revelation"", ""Let It Rain"", and ""Diving"". If you're considering on buying this album, BEWARE, some of the reviews on here are quite misleading. I guess what I think is fundamentally flawed in this album, is the simple fact that it lacks variety or substance - most of these tracks seem very repetitive, simple, effortless....It seems like 4 Strings' second album delivers the sort of diversity this one lacks....I would encourage tranceoholics to check that one out....otherwise for four standout songs this CD is just not worth getting...Consider yourself warned!"
3,so-so,"i dunno what it is with 4 strings...they're missing something. there is no oomph to their songs. i dunno if its her voice or what...i've always bought their singles and they were just ok. just as this album is ok. i'm really surprised that they released a full length in the usa because none of their singles really made it onto the radio or top 40.i guess its a good thing when record labels are releasing full lengths in this genre of music. that doesn't happen all that often in trance/dance music. best tracks here are ""high on life"", ""summer sun"", and ""diving""."
2,Not for small items!,These clamps are very disappointing (and dangerous) when using with small items. The yellow tips rotate and flex losing grip on any small items with great force. This breaks the item and causes great potential for injuring yourself in the process..I keep them around for flat wood sheets and basic items but do NOT buy these for small projects.
2,Great as Just a Fan.,"Works great as a fan. Quiet. If you're looking to buy for the Ionizer feature, don't bother...you won't even know it's there."
3,Cool but not Silent!,"This fan puts out a great breeze and the ionization is noticeable even on my desk in my large office. However, it is definitely not quiet. I've resorted to placing TWO mousepads underneath it and that has reduced the noise about two-thirds."
1,As silent as a helicopter,"Considering that the fan's title says ""silent"", this fan is as silent as a helicopter in my bedroom.Also, the stand is somewhat clumsy and the fan tilts somewhat upwards, not directly at you."
2,Not Silent,"I bought this because it was implied that it was silent (as in the name ""Silent Electric Table Fan"") It works okay as a fan, but even on the lowest setting it is far from silent. I'll grant that it is quieter than the huge fan it replaced, but it's still very noisy and nowhere near silent."
4,Hallelujah! Billie Joe is back.,"I grew up listening to this album, but since my record player died and I moved on to compact disc, I've lamented the absence of ""Ode To Billie Joe"" from my CD collection. Now it can return to its pride of place :)"
1,Shipping Nightmare,"This is a great CD!!! Hearing ""Ode to Billie Joe"" and Bobbie's other classics was a great trip down memory lane. However, it took Amazon over 30 days to deliver this item and that was only after numerous emails. There attitude of ""just wait a few more days and email us again"" was both insulting and annoying. Thank goodness this wasn't a Christmas gift for someone."
3,Review of Bobbie Gentry,"The music world is noted for its list of 'one hit wonders.' Lynn Anderson, Teena Marie, and Bobbie Gentry. I was curious as to the number of ""Hits' that Ms. Gentry had, so I ordered the album. There was, as I expected, only one."
4,Great clamps for the shop,"These are probably great clamps for the shop but out in the field they are not practical. When you are in awkward positions or need to operate the clamp with one hand, then those cheesy plastic clamps with hand triggers are more useful. The problem is when the moving jaw is not engaged, it flops around and won't stay where you put it."
4,Insightful primer on Street Gang activities in small town.,L.A. Cop returns to home town & discovers big city gangbangers have moved in without local police recognizing their activities. Acts as advisor to police dept. bringing expertise from experiences as gang supression officer on streets of L.A. good fast paced read!
1,"A far-left, ideologically motivated, wretched tome","Partially funded by an offshoot foundation of the NDP, Dobbin's perspective is to the far left of most Candians' views and his harsh and undeserved criticism will contribute nothing to Canadians' knowledge of what Manning's Reform Party stands for."
2,Weak House Party Music,"I bought this CD, and was disappointed. All these songs in exception of DM's DJ Trippy, are a bunch of old school retakes, kinda whack. The best songs on here are the ones by DJ Trippy. I don't recommend this to any clubhead, or fan of progressive house music. It's a weak production, but I enjoyed Volume One, which was way better. I thought the sequel would be good like the first, but it didn't turn out this way for this title.Three words, buy Volume one!"
1,The video is only half the product.,This video describes exercises for you to do in a booklet which did not come with the video. I was repeatedly asked to turn off the video and do the next exercise in the workbook and then to make decisions based on results I could not obtain. No other book can be substituted. There is such an urgent need for good video for speed reading. This was disappointing.
4,New York Yankees Pink Knit Cap,It was a good quality for the money-but they get you on the shipping.
3,Rather Disappointing,"I was not overly impressed with the book. There were way too many newspaper clippings strung together. Also, the story was very very predictable, and Schiller did not do enough to create some intrigue or analysis. That said the book was a good summary of what happened. Schiller distilled a lot of complicated information. As long as the reader recognizes that this is a summary of what happened, and not much else, then it's an ok read."
1,could it be more boring???,"If you enjoy reading dry court transcripts, you'll love this book. It is an interesting story but was written in a totally boring way. I am so sorry I paid for this book. I see it sells used for [$]. That's about [$] too much! I love true crime but this one stinks!"
1,Horrible book,"This book read like it was written by a not-very-talented 12 year old. It was boring, repetitive and could've been summed up in 10 pages. What a complete waste of money. Complete waste."
1,Unbelievably boring,"I've had this book for over a year and just now finished it, after the 3rd time trying to read it. It is just so tedious, 90% courtroom dialogue, which is great if you want to fall asleep."
2,He sure phoned this one in,"The two stars I awarded are strictly for the inherently interesting case which Schiller chose as his subject. However, his plodding style wrings the life out of the story. The key individuals never come alive--barely any physical descriptions, no photos, no enriching details. It was difficult to keep all the attorneys straight, because none was described in any fashion, and no personality traits were portrayed. I've read better written grocery lists."
2,Where is the rest of this book?,"The facts of the story are quite interesting, but there is not enough background given on the victim and her husband or enough character development of the primary characters AT ALL and no pictures of them. It's hard to find a mental picture of them too. There is just not enough here to make a book..It seems like an magazine article blown up into a book.It is frustrating to read. I'd like to know more background on the characters, but it is not there. I would have liked to hear from more people who actually knew the victim, the husband, and the second wife and less from the lawyers."
1,Driest account of murder I've ever read,"I read a lot of true crime, but this was absolutely the driest account of murder that I've ever read. Throughout the tedious accounts of each lawyer's actions, motions filed, and depositons taken, we learn very little. The case does not reflect any emotion; we don't care about Eric Thomas (husband of the deceased) or about his wife. The characters are never personalized. We know more about the mass of attorneys involved than we do about the people involved in the case. I would rather have read the court transcripts than the excrutiatingly detailed legwork involved in this case.Unless you're interested in reading about the legal research involved with building a case, Save yourself some time and just read the inside flap and find something more interesting to read."
4,Cape May Courthouse,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I finished it in 4 days. The story at times seemed unbelievable as if it was fiction. I appreciated the detail of the narrative without it being too technical. I would definitely recommend this book to reading clubs so that you can debate whether it was an accident or murder.
3,Three and a half stars,"Well, if I could select ""three and a half,"" that's what I'd give it. Very, very interesting story. But, as others have said, the writer gets bogged down in detailed timelines of court filings, depo transcripts, etc. A little of that goes a long, long way. I also agree a previous customer that I would have preferred a section of photos and/or diagrams, to make the characters more real. I was kind of frustrated at the end of the book, when so much is left unresolved. But that is why it's nonfiction! The story really IS unresolved in real life."
3,You get what you pay for,I am satified with the product. But some warnings to potential buyers- The chest buckle rides a little high- The arm rests come out a little too easy- the cup/junk holder is positioned at about a 25Deg angle in my car which is not ideal
4,Good buy,"I bought this car seat for my 3 year old. She loves the look of the car seat. The buckle system is different from the many other car seats I've used (I have 7 children), and a little awkward. The mechanism for loosening or tightening the harness is not as easy to use as a lot of other car seats I've used. The pad that is supposed to make the seat more comfortable shifts and my daughter took it off because it was always bunched up. For the price, it seems like a good buy. If you are picky, spend more."
3,Great for the price!!,We have been extremely satisfied with this car seat. We wanted something for my husbands car as a back up for when I'm not home. It is very nice and padded sufficiently. I didn't rate it higher because the arm rests are flimsy and tend to get knocked off when I pull my son out of the seat. The other issue is the 5 point harness it a bit tricky to get tightened.
4,Great product for price!,We bought this after looking at booster/convertable seats at Walmart and Target. We ended up paying a few dollars more on Amazon. But they were in stock here and weren't at either one of the stores we were looking at. It is a little bulky. My son can't buckle himself very well; he can unbuckle though. But it is super comfortable and he can actually rest his head when he falls asleep. We would recommend this car seat!!
4,Good value,"Nice car seat, especially for the price. Exceeds safety standards, and we purchased this as a seat for my mom's car - my husband and I both have much pricier models in our cars. This was seems just as safe, without all the bells and whistles."
2,Straps are NOT worth it!,Has a very strange buckle that gets in the way. My daughter complains about every time she gets in the car. We sent this back for Graco.
2,Not worth the money,"The adjustment on the shoulder strap is extremely inconvenient and VERY hard to deal with with an impatient toddler. The armrests are flimsy and fall off, or are ripped off with little to no effort. The cupholder didn't stand a chance, fell off after about 4-5 uses. That I could have dealt with, but when her legs get pinched when clicking in the crotch strap on SEVERAL occasions...even when I try to shield it with my hand, it was time for it to go! Never get any of the problems with the $50 Graco convertable."
3,pleased but a little difficult,love this car sit but hate the 5 pt harness belts. It's not easy to adjust at all!! It also doesn't sit correctly on the child in the seat. Other then that I have no complaints for this product!!
3,Not Overly Impressed,These socks are true to size and comfortable. A little more sturdy than dress socks but not so thick that they change the way my shoes fit. I will likely buy these again.
2,'Slouch' socks,"Wigwam is such a good brand & the high price really made me think the quality must be great. The socks will not stay up. They are like the 'slouch' socks some kids like to wear. The sizing is correct but he can't use a rubber band or those 'sock suspenders' to keep them up. We were disappointed with them & glad I only bought the 1 pair to try first. We have found it hard to find good diabetic white socks. We will keep looking, I guess. These were not the 'best', in our opinion."
3,Needs a bit more cushion,"Appears to be well made but a tad thin all around- could use more heel cushion too. As for wear and tear, time will tell. Think I'll check out the db socks sold by Walgreens. They have them in black now."
1,A sock not worth having at any price,"There are many problems that diabetic's face daily. One of these problems should not be their socks. Nor should diabetic face scams by merchants claiming to solve their aches and pains, at an elevate price. This sock does nothing. The sock is poorly made out of the cheapest material and it will not stay up, as such the marketing relies on suckers like me for a one time purchase. if you are a diabetic or if you even wear socks, save your money on this one."
1,Looks Aren't Everything,Wigwam Men's Diabetic Strider socks have a promisingname which in no way lives up to reality.They fall apart almost instantly. They bind. Theyhave too much spandex and are really an inferior product.But they look good in advertisements and on first use.I am amazed at how lame they are !
3,"Good sock, elastic too tight at top","They are good socks and comfortable on the foot, but the elastic is too tight at the top for my swelling legs."
4,Glad companies like Wigwam make these,"Before I started getting swelling problems in my feet, I got all my socks from REI which included Wigwam hikers. I really liked the Wigwam brand, how they fit and held up over time. I was glad to find that Wigwam makes these socks specifically for people with swelling problems in their feet. I got a couple pair to try them out and they are nice looking, well made as the others and comfortable to wear. They are easy and smooth to put on too, if you are someone who has a hard time bending over or trying to pull on regular socks that are tight going on and are hard to pull up. These socks are comfortable to wear, have a regular crew length and the tops do not fall down. They are loose-fitting to be comfortable and not aggravate swelling. I am glad Wigwam makes these so I didn't have to search that hard for a quality sock that meets my new needs."
2,X means Unknown alright.,"The sizing on the socks is TOO loose. Large was too tight on my swollen feet and legs. X-Large won't stay up, and slides off my feet when walking in my ""sock-feet"". Which I need to do for several hours a day while teaching Kids."
3,Better than a normal sock,"These constrict your leg less rhan a normal sock, but they don't stay up and still leave marks on your ankles."
3,Heaven's Gift,"Where angels go, love is sure to follow.The last thing J.T. Rafferty expected when he awoke from a concussion was to find a beautiful stranger tending to his wounds. She'd saved his life, but the lovely Caitlan Daniels had some serious explaining to do, like how she had ended up on his isolated ranch lands, miles from civilization.Despite his wariness, J.T. found himself increasingly drawn to Caitlan, whose gentle touch promised sweet satisfaction. She was passionate and independent and utterly enchanting. But Caitlan also had a secret, and when J.T. finally discovered the shocking truth, he'd have to defy heaven and earth to keep her close to his heart."
2,I wish he used fewer words to get to his point,"It's mostly common sense advice. Stuff like ""Think about your audience before you write"" and ""Email should be casual yet professional."" There are lots of checklists that are too easy to gloss over. A book titled ""Write to the Point"" should help one write concise and precise writing, asStott's bookdoes. Iacone's book is more like a handbook of how to rephrase business writing for the situation and audience."
5,Excellent,"I now see that En Esch was the real talent behind KMFDM, not the Che worshipping self important Sascha K. I recommend that anyone who was not to impressed with KMFDM's 2 latest albums buy this Album."
1,Cute but not functional,"Bought this for my 3yr and 6 yr old girls. Both loved this out of the packaging but despite our efforts to adjust the goggles and flippers, they just did not stay on in the pool. So after a few minutes they were relegated to the side of the pool. Basically these were a waste of money."
5,why so costly?,"if you own this, please liberate this title to the web for fan downloads. The price charged for this title is unreasonable."
4,If you like Coldplay,"1.36 is a strange little song, but not bad. Chris' vocals sound pretty weird on it. But the real gem here is ""I Ran Away,"" which is a really great song. I don't see why it wasn't on ""Rush of Blood to the Head."" And of course, The Scientist is a very good song."
2,"Nice clip, bad sound","I needed a pair of running headphones that sounded good (at least better than the crappy iPod headphones) so I went to circuit city, and bought basically the only non-Sony clip on headphones they had.The clip on mechanism is fine, though the clipping portion becomes sore on my head behind my ears. But they serve the funciton of keeping them on your head well, even though they dont thoroughly push the unit into your ear.I could live with this if not for the fact that the sound reproduction is terrible. No bass, the midrange is extremely scratchy, and I think the uppoer frequencies are way, way too bright. I often pumped the volume to get the bass, but had to bring it back down because the upper frequencies were torturing my ears.I've tried a number of different EQ settings, but I was never satisfied. In the end, if you are looking for some throwaway workout headphones, use these. If you dont want your music mangled, look elsewhere."
1,Terrible product,"The sound quality of these JVC headphones are normal, but I find this product terrible for the following reasons:1. Box was marked as ""iPhone Compatible"" but these headphones do not include a microphone or a Play/Pause button.2. Ear buds are huge! And they don't come with adjustments.3. No rubber ear bud tips were included. The ear buds feel too hard.4. The cord used has a natural tendency to twist, always ending up in knots.In summary, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't pay more than two bucks for these."
3,Content doesn't match cover,"The music is great but this DVD has no video! Just show pictures of herbs, flowers and scenery. Seems fraud from the cover. Music itself do worth if you can also get a same discount as less than five bucks as me."
1,Too Much Negativity,"As a Muslim woman convert myself, I'm not exactly sure what the purpose of this book was. I found an alarming number of stories about violence in the relationships of these women. Yes, many of the stories were positive but they were overshadowed by the sensationalism of the abusive relationships some of these women had to deal with. I also didn't appreciate the fact that one story was about a ""used-to-be-christian, then became Muslim, and now-am-Christian again and need to help abused Muslim women"" woman. If the book was about Muslim women, she should have been excluded because she blamed her abusive relationship on Islam and any Muslim who practices the religion correctly knows that it is in no way condoned by the faith. Some of this book just reinforces negative stereotypes that the American public already has about Islam. With so many negztive things about the religion in the news, I would have liked for this book to be solely positive."
1,What a fraud!!!,"I bought this book with a genuine curiosity, a real interest to discover what evidence there may be for the existence of the character Jesus Christ as portrayed in the gospels. What a disappointment! Mr van Voorst's book is nothing short of an intellectual fraud because he presents no evidence at all merely a collection of hearsay statements and inferences from the Gospels and Christian forgeries, the standard Christian apologetics. Dont waste your money nothing new here."
3,Handy but could grip more firmly,"I've used two of these clamps for about a year and do like the quick release. Some people have commented that it can pinch your fingers. Perhaps that is the case with the shorter models?The grip is not strong enough for some board joining exercises, e.g. doweling butt joints. I'm not sure whether it is because of the soft yellow grips or something to do with the hand pull. Whatever the case, sometimes you have to wrap the hand pull with duct tape around the fixed blue stem in order to acheive enough clamping force.I have to say that after purchasing the Jorgensen clamps I am happier with those although the quick release is not as easy to pull."
5,union carpenter,Best clamp you can buy when doing furniture and setting countertops! Price is great and very easy to transfer from job to job. Highly recommend you have a few of each size.
2,The Clamps not bad but the companysure is,"these 1 handed clamps are great in the shop, a real must have. They don't have the gripping or holding power as the screw types but for most jobs they work great. Most of the time I position the pieces together with one hand holding the work and the other putting the quick clamp on to hold it secure enough to install the heavy duty clamps if need be. There are several compaines who sell 1 handed clamps, Irwin is just one of them. Irwin ,however, will not get any more of my money as they are one of the ""sneeky"" compaines. I saw the 20/20 show about compaines who use sneeky tacticts and fine print to ""weed out"" their rebate forms. They try to deter as many as possible from reciving their advertised sales/rebates so they can make more profit. Well Irwin is one of those companies.My suggestion is yes purchase several of these clamps just don't buy them from Irwin."
4,The Birds Eye View,"Afghan/Soviet War books can be broken up into a finite set of subjects. Personal/First Person Journalist account, War tactics or High level political/war analysis.This book is squarely in the last category. A view of the war as described by the Pakistani ISI Brigadier General who ran it.Regardless of the fact that the book is one sided, I found the book invaluable as a reference on how the Pakistani's ran the war. From Supply chain, US politics, right to on-the-ground tactics; the General goes over everything. At some points admitting Government secrets (That had probably be unclassified by print time).An excellent book, well written, and interesting. The book even reviews at a tactical level, many battles you can read in ""The Other Side of the Mountain"".This book won't cover the entire war, but is a great high level view of the Pakistani operational framework."
5,The BADDEST vocalist around!,"James LaBrie is at his shining best here. A must have for any fan of Dream Theater or progressive music. James shows a return to form here with high, powerful range. Strong, aggressive songs penned by Matt Guillory from Dali's Dilemma mix fantastically throughout the disc with beautiful melodies from the Shadow Gallery fellows. A few interesting tunes come by way of Trent Gardner from Magellan: ""Beelzebubba"" (an ode to Bill Clinton), And ""What A Man Thinks"" - A big, booming, over the top song that blends accapella harmonies, blaring horns, and blatant influences from Queen into a fun, energetic romp. I love this disc every time I listen to it. It's like one of those films where catch a new detail every time you watch it. Standout song for me is ""Lace"". Make sure to add this and the new Dream Theater album ""Scenes From A Memory"" to your collection now!"
4,"Very good, but no Dream Theater...","Don't get me wrong, James Labrie writes a great song. Maybe he was lost in the over indulging likes of Dream Theater and he felt the need to really do his own thing. Trouble is, much of this disc sounds like DT. While there are some sweet lullibies in ""Sacrifice"" and ""Slow Burn"", the other songs have that rocking progressive attitude we've come to know & love with LaBrie's tenure with DT. The first 3 songs (""His Voice"", ""Statued"", and ""Shores of Avalon"") fire out of the shoot with a hard & crunchy feel. The middle of the disc slows down a bit and then it ends with the least inspired & noisy untitled cut labeled ""As A Man Thinks"". Overall a very good effort by LaBrie & Co, and it does rival those early songs of a young DT. But if you listen to the supporting Mullmuzzler cast, you'll realize that their musicianship, tho very competent, can't compete with DT's peerless Petrucci, Portnoy, Myung & Rudess."
4,Labrie Alone,Labrie (with Guillory) can live Whitout DT.Good Guitar saturated and strong pusles drums with Mangini.Labrie sing like Labrie as usual
2,Inspect it before you buy,"The clamp looks great until you start look closer at it. If you look at the lower jaw you will notice that the hole for the hand screw is usually not drilled staight or in the center. When the screw is not straight it can cause the work to misalign as you tighten it or if it's not drilled in the center, can weaken the clamp. I still like the clamps but when I buy them I go to the store and inspect each one I buy. I don't mind spending extra for quality tools but I think Bessey can do better than this."
4,"Packaging packaging, packaging packaging","I ordered 4 of these 36""-ers and 4 24""-ers. I received 8(EIGHT) boxes on my porch- 4 boxes were 26x19x8.75inches and 4 were 40x12x15.75 THAT's a LOT of box space on your front porch!!!I saw a review from someone who whinged about the LACK of packaging on clamps and how his stuff was damaged and he thought Amazon was better at packing stuff. I guess they took it to heart- or heart body and soul. Danged if you do, danged if you don't. The cardboard I can recycle, but the big bubbles are type 4 plastic which I can't recycle here in Moab, Utah. There was plenty of space in one of the J4 size boxes for all eight clamps with perhaps a little different wraping to keep them from banging together, and the shipping! For me it was free, but 7 more boxes than necesary? Oh, the clamps work just fine."
1,Not flattering at all..,I purchased these pants for my fiance and they are still hanging in the closet with the tags still attached waiting to be return. The fabric is very flowy and silk like and made my fiance look like he had stepped back into the early 90's. Hammerman style is a better way of putting it. I refuse to let him wear them. UGLY!
4,My girlfriend really likes the Oprah DVD set,My girlfriend has really enjoyed the Oprah DVD. It's a little longbut I guess you just get more for your money.
3,Oprah anniversary DVDs,Excellent! Fun to see the special moments again. Always something to make you laugh or cry. Great set!!
2,If you LOVE Oprah then buy it,"Otherwise - a waste of money. I borrowed it from a friend :) To me she comes across as ""unreal"", artificially ""over-human"". But considering other talk show hosts she is definitely top. I never made it through 18 hours though .."
5,AMAZING,"Most amazing thing in the world, Oprah, the show and the woman, should be taught in schools and colleges across this nation and the world. I learned so much from these DVDs and will buy these as gifts for all my friends and family. Amazing..... just amazing, buy it if you've never seen am Oprah show in your life, or if you have seen every episode ever made. Bravo Oprah! Oprah for President 2008!"
5,WHAT A WONDERFUL PERSON,"I watch Oprah whenever I can, and I am seldom disappointed with any episode. I even went to Chicago to be present at one of the tapings. Just after that episode she asked the audience ""who is here from far away?"" and I was too shy to raise my hand (that was in 1998, before she became a regular visitor to our country). This DVD set does deliver and a lot of pleasant Oprah memories are revisited. I did miss the ""when I was hungry you gave me an apple"" episode (do you remember the 2 old people who were together in Auschwitz?), but I presume one would need at least 20 discs to gather all the highlights of 20 years of broadcasting. This is a wonderful boxed set with hours of good television to enjoy over and over. Next step for Oprah - President of the USA - and I am not even joking."
2,like watching a train wreck,"I've personally hated Oprah for many years now and I purchased this box set in order to study her. While I continually have the taste of vomit in my mouth, I find myself strangely unable to turn off the videos..."
1,The Oprah Winfrey Show - not a very good product,"How could it be a good product? Just like her everyday show, it's shallow and boring. The interviews have no substance and they focus too much on Oprah and not on the guest. There is no quality or substance in this product, and the editing is bad too."
2,Vastly Overrated,"While I applaud Oprah Winfrey's Success,She has also become a Shameless Self-Promoter. how she forgot the Importance that Michael Jackson had on Her Success is Mind-blowing to me.naw She would rather use Lisa Marie Presley as a way to acknowledge Michael Jackson.newsflash to Oprah Winfrey: you are in Michael Jackson House.without MJ there wouldn't have been the big blow up you got after 1993.anyway she has accomplished alot,but she has gotten to be a Hack.she should retire.all She does now is play the Puppet role."
4,i like it,"i like it especially the Christmas in Africa footage, i wish there were more!i wished the interviews were full not edited..."
2,Defective DVD's,Half of the segments I couldn't view because the DVD's were defective-all scrambled. The same with the replacement set.I'm a long time Oprah viewer and fan. Half of the segments I was able to view were a bummer - depressing. I wish I had saved some of the funniest and most heart warming segments I taped over the years. They were a lot better than what was selected.The only redeeming value is that the money spent is for a good cause.
5,INSPIRATION,"FANTASTIC, BRILLIANT, WONDERFUL, SIMPLY THE BEST OF MISS O.HOURS OF INTERVIEWS WITH THE STARS, PERSONAL MOMENTS, BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION. MISS O IS TRUELY AN INSPIRATION TO US ALL."
5,Oprah review,"On vacation a few years back, my sister brought the 20th anniversary collection of Oprahs greatest shows. I loved them and recently just purchased the set for myself. ""Sing it Nate"" is a show that ALWAYS makes me smile no matter how many times I view it. I equally love that the collection is organized into show categories so that whatever mood you are in, wanting to laugh or cry, Oprah offers it. The viewer of these DVD's will not be disappointed as long as they love Oprah! :)"
5,Oprah,This DVD is great for anyone wating to spend hours reviving the best moments of the show! Oprah's comments about most episodes are excellent!
3,Wanted to see more of the past,"While I enjoyed this collection, it seemed to focus on the last three or four years, when I was watching Oprah daily. It barely covered the late eighties and early nineties when I wasn't watching. I guess Oprah didn't want to look at herself for more then a few seconds in any of the old clips. I also would have liked her to talk more about the changes they made in what stories they featured as a result of the talk show wars of the early nineties."
5,Oprah Winfrey 20yrs,"If I could give this a 10 star rating, I would!! This DVD is a must have for all fans and non-fans of Oprah. All the highlights that you've ever missed by not being able to watch Oprah during the daytime is captured on this DVD. Some parts had you laughing alot and some parts crying alot. What a wonderful gift from Oprah who does so much in giving of herself and her resources. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD and its WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!"
1,DON'T GET ME WRONG THIS IS A GREAT RECORD,"however THIS edition is on the ""COLLECTABLES"" line - well, as the other ones from this company I have purchased it sounds like they transferred the vinyl right to a CD burner in a living room.This is a MONUMENTALLY great recording - Moonlight and Muzak / Woman Makes Man ! Genius. DO NOT BUY THIS ONE - there are other releases however I did not look further into the catalog on amazon when I purchased this 2nd rate rubbish - so I am returning and reordering.RADIO DISCO BROTHERS"
3,One masterpiece on average synthpop album,"This album kicks off with M's brilliant piece of catchy synth-pop, the appropriately titled Pop Muzik that's become a classic of the genre. Unfortunately nothing else on the album comes close to that masterpiece, although Moonlight And Muzak and That's The Way The Money Goes are also melodic and fairly engaging. The former is a romantic mid-tempo ballad with male and female vocals whilst the latter has a quirky, lilting dance beat, catchy ""pop go the people"" chorus and a sample or two. Woman Make Man is a sensual pop ballad with sensuous female vocals, Moderne Man rolls by without posing any threat to Gary Numan or Thomas Dolby and Made In Munich is a typical Disco album track of the time. The rest is just filler material. M will forever be famous for the unsurpassable Pop Muzik, one of 1979's most appealing synth-pop classics, but that's a good enough reason for the pop hall of fame."
2,A one hit wonder........and deservedly so.,"Did'ja ever wonder why we never heard from ""M"" again after the mega-success of ""Pop Muzik""? One listen to this album, and you'll understand why. Yeah, ""Pop Musik"" was, and is, a catchy song, but nothing else in the ""M"" catalog can measure up to that track. If you can find this song on a compilation album, you would be better off spending money on that instead."
3,Works OK but too Short,This cable does what is supposed to but it was too short for my set up. I am surprised that these adapter cables are not available in longer lengths.
1,"""...no worse thief...""","""There is no worse thief than a bad book,"" a quote by Benjamin Cheever sums up Cosmopolis for me. Unless you can fully suspend your belief system so that somehow you can be driven in your limo in NYC traffic while occasionally stopping for sex, shopping, eating, monitoring the Yen, destroying your wife's fortune, having a proctology exam in the car . . . asymmetrical findings (hmmm) this book is akin to a house invasion. Awful."
2,Good idea; poor writing,"DeLillo has a critical following, so I thought I would give him a chance by reading this short novel. The novel explores a day in the life of a young Wall Street billionaire, Eric Packer. DeLillo does a nice job of narrating the stream of consciousness of his protagonist and exploring his combination of narcissism and existential anguish. What's missing is any sympathetic character who points the way toward a viable alternative to the bankruptcy of modern American life. Another glaring, and perhaps fatal, weakness is DeLillo's inability to write dialogue -- a rather surprising deficit for a ""modern master."" DeLillo's descriptions of Packer's thinking and internal mental life are believable and sometimes compelling. But what he says and what others say to him is wooden and so bad as to be laugh-out-loud funny.I don't recommend this book. I may still try to read one of his other novels, but this one is a clunker."
3,"It's DeLillo, but...","I was fortunate to read End Zone in the year of publication. Great Jones Street, et al - I've been on board. Even attended the Underworld book tour appearance in Los Angeles. Plus he's Italian.The voice I hear in his latest, is Don DeLillo's chronological one; not that of a 28-year old. Not even close.Another poster has made the comparison to Bret Easton Ellis; I too felt his shadow fall on these pages (despite the dedication to Paul Auster).I would recommend the reading of this book. It's only that you are getting the up-to-date DeLillo.Similar to the great improvisers of jazz, a musician peaks, levels-off and 'the sound of surprise' is 'ner more."
1,"Can you say ""American Psycho""??","I think people are just scared to admit that this book is terrible lest they be snubbed by other members of the Book Snob Elite. Unfortunately, Brett Easton Ellis did this story a long time ago - and better. DeLillo sleepwalked through this one - a total waste of time. Not worth finishing for any good reason at all."
1,Phony. Pretentious. Inane. Blase. Uninspired.,"Delillo seems to think his ""observations"" are novel and deep. In truth, Delillo's ""observations"" in this little novella are phony, pretentious, inane, immature, misguided, blase, uninspired, and downright imbecilic at times.I'd offer some quotations to back this up but this book already found it's rightful place (before it could be finished): the trash can of a train station."
1,What was he thinking?,"I don't need 1000 words to express my lack of enthusiasm for this book, my first DeLillo read. For the first 50 pages I took notice of his use of adjectives, quite innovative. The rest of the book, about a heartless, robotic man who ""becomes"" what he ""sees"" is nonsensical and cold. I knew what the ending would be, but held back my desire to skip to it and end the torture. Definitely not recommended for anyone who appreciates good literature or is looking for news on the human character or condition."
2,"Starts well, ends crazily","I bought this book while on vacation in Italy - it was the only novel in English by a literary type author in the bookstore. I knew De Lillo was supposed to be a great author and so I bought it. Also, I am interested in reading about financial figures like George Soros or Warren Buffet.The book reminds me of the movie Apocalypse Now which starts wonderfully with great cinematography and eventually descends into craziness and nonsense IMHO. This book starts well with a high concept and great writing style and then gradually descends into implausibility, nonsense etc. The financial transactions didn't seem very plausible to me and the motivation didn't make sense any more and the events at the end of the day involved far too much coincidence to be plausible.Unless of course the latter parts of the day are all meant to be some psychotic episode."
1,DELILLO WHO?,"A total mismash of observations, half baked philosophy, unstructured paragraphs, pointless dialogue. Waste of reading (or listening) time.I read this after rereading Philip Roth's Zuckerman books. Perhaps that was a mistake. Roth lives and creates life on the page. DeLillo is off in some never never land of his imagination. It does not relate to human experience. It is artificial posturing, meant to shock, but ends up boring.I recommend you get works by Roth, Updike, Bellow, Richard Ford, Ruth Rendel, among others. Even formula writers like Robert Parker and John Mortimer are more stimlating and fun."
1,A Literary Abomination,"I fail to see how the other reviewers of this book can praise it so effusively without breaking down into school-girl giggles. Cosmopolis is not a novel, it is a form of torture. The dialogue is unrealistic to the point of absurdity, filled with inane observations and non-sequiturs. In fact, the entire book is so rife with irrelevancies that I'd swear a child with ADD wrote it. My three year-old cousin can compose more coherent sentences than the ones which litter the pages of this atrocity. I seriously wonder whether DeLillo actually thought about what to say in his passages, or if he merely rifled through the dictionary and chose words at random. Be forewarned: buying this book supports literary terrorism."
3,A good read ...,"Intriguing concept for a novel, and the writing is interesting. It's certainly a fast read, and worth the time. Not a mojor work, but entertaining. Certainly cosmopolis is better than End Zone, and Body Artist."
2,A fictional book about the dark side of capitalism,"It's ironic that you have a film and book, which has undertones of anti-capitalism, depending upon its own success on capitalism. Perhaps if the producers, artists and writers are really against the free market they should just avoid any marketing of the book or film-no promoting, no funding or even profiting - since all these activities usually associated with capitalism have no redeeming value. Now that might have made a more interesting statement than this vapid novel."
2,dvd,"I got this book because I understand that a movie is in the works. I felt thatthe writing was pretentious and didn't really care for anyone in the story. I hope thatDavid Cronenberg, the projected director can make something of this. I would see the filmonly because I am a Robert Pattinson fan and he is to play the lead in this film."
2,Cosmopolis,Boring didn't keep me interested. Read bout 5 chapters and put it down. Don't reccommend .Really disappointed hoped for good read
1,Not my kind of reading.,"I did not like the movie, and did not like the book. Sorry. I think he does not need to use so many metaphors to express ideas that can be perfectly understood if just directly expressed."
1,Cosmopolis,"I did not understand it. I looked on the internet and there were many negative comentaries, the readers did not understand either. It is absurd text."
1,Very Strange Novel,"This was not what I expected. I never read a Don Delillo book. I don't think I will read another any time soon. It was difficult to follow, strange, and weird at times. It reminded me of a Quinton Tarantino type story (I love Tarantino films), but without the suspence and direction. I found it to be dull, even boring. I may watch the movie out of curiosity once it is available for free, but I won't pay to see it."
1,Cosmopolis,Couldn't get into it. The irritation was that the writer was obviously impressed with himself and how much more intelligent he is than the rest of the world.
4,Not bad,"A fast paced book that takes place in a limo in one day. Our hero is a fabulously rich man who has married on heiress that he keep losing. He conducts business in his limo and his people come to him. Anyway a very odd, compelling book"
1,Puffed Up Trash,"A terrible read. DeLillo at his worst, I think, writing in a pastiche of his old sharp style. Sentences are gratuitous, cheap, labored. It appears he visited NYC with a notebook and tried to get down his fleeting scenes. While the plot is OK, it's nothing to crow about. But those sentences give no stunning surprise, no postmodern meaning, no delectable wordplay. Don't get me wrong, I loved Underworld, I liked many of his works, but this one is just plain bad. Head to Will Self's best or Independence Day by Richard Ford -- a great novel."
1,A Failure,"The concept, a day-in-the-life of a young American capitalist as he sets out in his limo to get a haircut uptown is intriguing. However, the devil lies in the details of which this book is sparingly thin on. The main character and the lovers and American archtypes(anarchists, protestors, politicians, wall st gurus) he encounters throught out the day are, as Melville would say, nothing but pasteboard masks. Delillo is an original writer chasing after interesting ideas relevent in American culture, it is just that in this book unlike ""White Noise"" and ""Libra"" he didn't do his homework and the book comes off flat as a result."
3,Short read.,"Decent story, not his best work. Luckly I only paid a dollar for my copy at the Dollar Tree."
4,Cosmopolis,"Wasn't sure about this book when I first got it as it's not what I would consider an ""easy"" read. Here's what worked for me...first, skim the book just to get an idea of the rhythm and flow of the language and scenes. Then go back for a REAL read. Somewhere in there, I would suggest reading some synopses and reviews and listening to a series of radio interviews with the author, Don DeLillo, that can be found on YouTube. Made the story much more understandable and enjoyable for me and for others I know who have now read the book. I'm actually now reading the book for a third time...just to make sure I didn't miss anything and to make discussing it with others more enlightening. Give it a try...It's worth it!"
4,The Death of Capitalism,"I take Packer as a stand-in for capitalism gone wild and savage. There was a line in there somewhere about how the logical conclusion of capitalism is killing. Packer's rapacious and deliberate murder of the world's currencies in one day's time leads him logically to seek the assassin who's been stalking him (a former employee). The two wax philosophically about each other's personality deficits, a bumbling last rites."
2,Some sentences worth reading; whole book is not,"I went to see DeLillo read from this at the Steppenwolf in Chicago and left half way through. A friend who had attended the reading with me had bought a copy of the book. He read it then passed it on to me. I thought I'd try to read because I've like DeLillo's earlier books (except End Zone).The characters don't interest me, they're flat. All in all, the book has the quality of a take myself too seriously TV series and a shock-fest like American Psycho. This one seems to borrow too much from the saccharine world of Bret Easton Ellis but I don't think that DeLillo really lives in this kind of world (thank heaven's for that). Easton's work is overwrought and it seems as of late that he's written himself out. Compared to other DeLillo works, this is lackluster. He's such a fantastic writer, the sentences he contructs are fantastic. Such a shame to waste that talent on a tale such as this."
1,Possibly the worst book I know of.,"It was repulsive, and I quit reading it because the Author must have been smoking dope and dropping acid when he conceived it."
4,Spacious and vast space jazz,"Ashley Beedle and company with an original, well-done album that will be on my listening list for some time to come. It's a mature sound that explores different moods and vibes in a way that'll have you now smiling, then brooding. It's a deeper concept: this one's not gonna jump out and smack you in the face and then sound stale a few weeks later - instead, the grooves are minimal and open, inviting you to meet the funk halfway. If you are into Larry Heard or Charly Brown, for example, you'll dig this one. Includes some stuff previously on vinyl (on Nuphonic) plus some new tracks."
3,"Not all that, but...","It's cool, the only problem we have is the rollers sliped off the shaft that turns the rollers the first time we used it. So if your not watching it your hot dogs will burn in one position. It gets hot enough and they taste great when done. After the first couple of times I put a couple of drops of oil on it and it worked just fine. Also my wife complained that it had a metal smell when it was cooking. It usually takes 20-30 minutes to cook on high ,depends on how done you want your dog. If something were to go wrong with this I wouldn't purchase this one again. I would go with something more heavy duty. THis will do until then though."
2,Defective,This is a defective DVD just as the others have said. The Last 3 episodes do not play. Doesn't matter which source you purchase the DVD from.
1,I hate EDITS,I am not a fan of DIC. This one is okay but not the greatest. So if you love sailor moon get the uncut version. The DIC version is for little kids. Uncut Version is for older teens.Theres a huge differnece between uncuts and edits.
1,not good,"i bought this dvd through amazon.com and the last 3 episodes dont work, then i bought another one, and it still didnt work!!! and its not my dvd player, i tryed it on many, so no one should buy this dvd unless the fix it!!"
3,"Great Premise, Weak Writing","This is not Jess Walter's best book. The plot is fascinating and quickly takes a reader in. However, his writing has been cut down here to leave a reader wanting greater characterization and more even plotting."
3,This one took the Cake,The begining was great Guy walks into police station to confess but plot warps out Leaving a gap.where the only thing worth remebering was a set-up Cant see this one getting great reviews
5,Bessey is the Best,"Have used Bessey clamps for a number of years. Needed some additional clamps so purchased this one. Good all around clamp, very heavy duty and lets you tighten with as much force as needed. I have used this in woodworking and automotive repair. Would definitely recommend it!!!"
4,bessey clamps,I currently own 5 different sizes of Bessey clamps. I feel they are as good a clamp as is made. I only rated them 4 stars because I feel the new ones are not quite as good as the quality of my old ones.
1,broken clamp,"The first day, I used my clap, one of them broke and I dont know how to get ahold of anybody. I called Bessey and they may help me. I dont knowI am not happy"
1,Useless,"I was glad to see that there is a free thesaurus for Kindle. But after I downloaded it, I realized why it's free. It's a bunch of jumbled up words and is horribly formatted, and there's no way to search for anything. It's useless."
1,not what I expeceted,Did not like the ability to find a word without scrolling page after page. I deleted this app.went and bought collegiante Thesaurus
1,NOT EVEN WORTH ONE STAR!!!,I will make this as clear as possible DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT !!! Not even a real therasaus. Really confusing to read. Not worth your time and was not worth your star even. Even worse there was no pictures. :(
1,Is this a joke?!!!!!,"Are you serious? I had to do an assignment where I had to use a thesaurus. There are hundreds of pages, but no search bar! Do they expect us to flip to it when it's not even in ABC Order!!!!! Id rate O if it let you"
1,Useless and frustrating,"I`m glad it was free because it was not helpful. I found out that it was not indexed for searching only when I needed it, then had to scramble for a better version."
3,"It's what it is, and gets the job done.","Hey, we all need a thesaurus from time to time. I don't need it often but, when I do, I'm glad it's on my Kindle. It wouldn't be very good without Kindle's Search feature, but it works well enough as the great reference book that it is."
2,Kinda like the 60's,This one hit wonder did have a bullet with Blue...Navy...Blue...Sure you will recall this one.
1,From an Former Sailor,"This Album is rather offensive to me....... And to any one listening to any of the songs on this entire album, unfortunely I've heard this CD.. maybe you won't ever have to..."
4,Great book to read to kids....,They were mesmerized throughout the read.....would recommend it highly for kids from 4 to 9 and beyond...
3,Divertido,"Debido al año de fabricación, se entienden las limitaciones en cuanto a calidad de graficos. Sin embargo el manejo de los vehículos es muy agradable."
4,Music at It's Best,"I enjoyed his music as a young man, I still enjou his music as an old man. Actually I can appreciate his music more now."
5,"essential, nothing else like it","Thi is still a classic text, which no one interested in C.20 Marxism and the study of culture and society, can afford to miss. Many of these essays have gone on to achieve clasic status-- jameson, hall, west, spivak, lefebvre, laclau, pecheux and balibar. All great pieces. whats esp valuable are the exchanges b/w particpants-- this bk, includes highlights from the discussion sections after the talks.The writing is uniformly excellent, and most are immediately accessible to non-academic intellectuals. Kudos to grossberg and nelson and the unit for criticism for putting this collection/event together years ago. If this bk goes out of print, it''l be a crime against humanity"
2,Mostly jargon-laden ...,"An incredibly jargon-laden work. Sadly, many of the contributors really have nothing to say and spend a long time not saying it. On a few occasions, however, some of the contributions really shine and remind one that not all of academia is populated by mediocrity."
4,Vash The Stampede,"The story of a wanted man known as Vash Stampede with a bounty of 60 billion double dollars, that's why every man would like a piece of him. This series is quite funny with some nasty villains and likeable characters. You might want to check this one out, the animation is great, lots of action and gags from Vash himself!"
3,Heading In The Direction Of Mediocrity,"I really liked the first 4 Trigun discs (even though 2-4 had only 3 episodes a piece). Despite the fact that Trigun was another ""wandering samurai looking for redemption anime"", it was a fresh and funny series. Volume 5 starts off really stale with a generic filler story that has no bearing on the overall picture. The next two episodes are better and advance the story but the series falls into another anime cliche, a battle with a series of villains to fight the ""big boss"". Damn shame, I had high hopes for this series."
4,Far out! What a ride!,"Fast paced, funny, and thoroughly entertaining. Troutman Penthouse brings us back to the mid-1970s complete with disco balls and one-hitters. In a fog of marijuana smoke and cheap beer, the story follows Bobwhite as he navigates through the maze of college dorm life, love, sex, and bizarre human behavior. He's nave and lacks even the most rudimentary form of common sense but he's sweet, charming, and just a little bit sad. Don't miss this book. It's an awesome TRIP."
2,No Vista Driver Support,"I am unable to get the USB Bluetooth adapter to work w/ Vista. I just got off of chat w/ Plantronics support. Plantronics says that they neither support nor provide any drivers. If you need this to work w/ Vista, I suggest looking for another product. It does work great w/ my cell phone, but paying extra for PC integration was a waste."
3,A bit disappointing,"The Plantronics .Audio 910 Bluetooth Headset with USB adapter was great in the initial few days for VOIP application, sound quality is good, background noise is low; but then I encountered difficulties with keeping the battery fully charged and having to re-sync the blue tooth to the USB adapter regularly. Finally, after a couple of weeks, it failed to connect any VOIP call and it started crashing my Skype application. So now I am back to my old Logitech device... and unhappy with my purchase."
3,"Good sounds, but difficult to keep on my ear","This headseat has great sound, and it easily switches from computer to cell phone -- but I have the hardest time keeping it on my ear. I've tried all of the different ear buds, and it just won't stay on!If you tend to have trouble keeping headsets on, this is not the product for you."
4,Worked great for me. I bought two as gifts.,I didn't have any difficulty installing this on Vista Home. It did take some time figuring out how to get the audio routed to the headset instead of the computer speakers but I did get it figured out. It works well with Yahoo IM and Skype. It also worked well with my Treo 650 cell phone.I had good reception for the most part. Turning on radios or other electronics sometimes cause occasional clicks or pops but I didn't find it overly distracting or annoying.The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that the charger is somewhat proprietary. I lost mine and went through Plantronics support to find a part number for the charger. It's 695-19-01 in case anyone needs it. At the time it cost 14.95. This is the reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.
1,Bad news bluetooth,"This product was great for the first couple of months, but now it doesn't work well at all. I have had it for about 6 months. I use it both with my cell phone and to talk on Skype. When using it with my cell phone, I sound really distant to the people I am talking to, so distant that they ask me to call back later when I don't have to use the bluetooth. When I use it on Skype, both I an the person I am talking to hear a lot of background noise, constant buzzing and occasionally high-pitched squealing."
3,Not very good quality,The audio quality of this product is not as good as I expected. It sounds as a cheap phone call and the link sometimes disconnects.
2,Bluetooth headset,"I never got this thing to work on either of my Bluetooth computers or cell phone. Don't know about anyone else, but I wasted my money."
2,Not Quite As Good As Advertised,Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint TechnologyInstruction brochure difficult to understand. Mute button is the same as the on/off button - this can cause problems! Device does not fit snuggly to the ear. Sound quality is good.
1,This does not need to exist.,"The content gets five stars; Rykodisc gets one.Shame on them for releasing this; without consulting Hicks' camp, no less. Especially tragic is the fact that they have at least two more albums' worth of ""new"" material they could release instead of this.If you want to buy a Bill Hicks album, buy all four others. Start with Rant In E-Minor and work your way back."
4,"Quintessential ""Bill"".","One of the previous reviewers pointed out that this stuff can't compare with the comic genius of the 80's sitcom ""My Two Dads."" It's probably a goof review, but I SO hope it's not because Bill would certainly get a kick out of a response like that from the Joey Lawrence/Everybody Loves Raymond, side of our population.If you're looking for a good sample of Bill Hicks comedy, this is a pretty good cd to start with. Some of his best subjects (although some of my favorites are noticably absent: Sharon Stones ""talent"", Jay Leno's satanic tryst, etc.) Be warned, if you are easily offended, better stick to Jeff Foxworthy, cause Bill pulls no punches, which is why I love him.In my opinion this guy was not only funny as hell, but a true free-thinker and an exposer of hypocrisy. Something we need more of.I only wish Bill had lived long enough to skewer ""W"" in his routine. I think the second Bush woulda truly inspired (sickened) Bill into some of his finest material yet.RIP Bill."
1,SHAME ON RIKO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (5 stars for Bill Hicks),"First off: BILL HICKS is a comic genius, to witness: any of the 4 previous CDs available by this genius. You dont need an edit of these 4 CDS as they are brilliant themselves. So why a best of? everything in previous CD's stood on their own, without needing some edits. ANd I am a living proof: I own close to 24 hours of bill hicks bootlegs and there is enough unreleased material to make one damn good disk. it would be *IMPERATIVE* for someone to release some of this never-heard-before material.till then, avoid this best of knowing that there is enough excellent stuff in the other 4 cd's to be well worth the money.BILL HICKS we miss you so much, come sqeegee our 3rd eyes."
1,Thumbs down,Love the program but hate the service as every year they wish to bill you $250 + to use the software! Rip off.
1,Dick's back in the saddle again.,"Win, Place or Show brings back one of my favorite protagonists and a gripping storyline. I enjoyed this book as much as I've enjoyed one in a long time. With the exception of Shattered, I've always found it difficult to put down one of Dick Francis's novels. This was a good adventure."
5,A highly educational and enlightening resource,"Compiled and co-edited by Gordon Morris Bakken (Professor of History, California State University, Fullerton) and Brenda Farmington (Adjunct Faculty Member, Long Beach City College), Encyclopedia Of Women In The American West is a scholarly reference studying the often-overlooked lives and roles of women on the American frontier. Alphabetical entries offer succinct summaries of great figures, events, situations, facets of daily duties, and more. A highly educational and enlightening resource, the Encyclopedia Of Women In The American West is a core recommendation for academic and public library American Western History Studies and Women's Studies reference collections, as well as an invaluable resource for writers and non-specialist general readers with an interest in studying women's experiences and contributions to American society and culture."
5,What a difference!,"So many self-help books do nothing but discuss general concepts and theories. This book gave me the tools I need to take specific steps toward a happier life. I'm not going to tell you that the sun came out, the birds started singing and I never had another problem again - but I will say that before I read this book, I never considered myself a very happy person. Now I do."
1,What difference?,This book has 28 pages of actual reading and the rest of the book is filled with a two page form for each of the 90 days you're expected to fill it out. I feel like I've been duped out of my money for this book.
1,Does not work with Mac OS X,"even though Susteen claims DataPilot for Mac supports my phone, a Samsung x475. Not only Mac users should be wary of purchasing this product but others should expect slow and inept technical support. After waiting more than a week for a response to my email request, the support tech's only advice was to upgrade to DataPilot version 2.2.0, which I had already clearly listed as my current version in the request. I have received no further response after I replied pointing out I already was using version 2.2.0 and asking for additional suggestions to get DataPilot to function. That was two weeks ago. Beware of this company!"
1,not impressed,I regret buying the product. I bought it direct from Susteen. Had I been smarter I would have tried to get a refund.
4,Makes A Great Dirty Martini,"Good stuff, one of the two best (the other being Olive Squeezins from FL) you can find on the market."
3,"Good, Basic, High-Current Cutoff Switch","Pros: Simple design, good fit.Cons: Due to a manufacturing error, the terminal receiver was threaded at a notable off-angle on this specimen; and required re-tooling to accommodate a 3/8-16 bolt-and-nut affixment for the ground connection.Overall workmanship for the item is fair to good; and the item functions as intended.However, I expected accurate manufacturing processes for the price point..."
5,Barefoot Bride,i am enjoyed reading this book and will get more from joan johnson as the financies allow me to buy more
5,Not disappointed at all!!!,"Thought I would be disappointed when I got this... I thought this was one of the Hawks way series, (i am seriously addicted to them...and thinking about seeking help for this ...LOL) Anyway, found out this was totally different, and loved it... I think I finished it is two days with a couple of very long nights... as soon as I was reading it, I thought...This has to have a sequel...it just has to...so on into the book I realized it must...I went searching and sure enough it does...Outlaws Bride!!! You must get it too...it is just as good... Joan Rocks!!! Nora Roberts used to be my favorite, and still like her, but Joan has taken the lead!!!! Hope you enjoy!!"
5,One of my favorite books I give away as a gift to my friends,"If you're a woman, you enjoy this book. Great writing style. It's one of my favorite books to give away as a present.Sonja Paris author of MAKE THE COUGAR PURR"
5,"Fodor's New Orleans, 2000","Wonderful book! My husband surprised me with a trip to New Orleans for our 10th anniversary and I took this book along. It helped make our trip remarkable! It suggested wonderful places to eat and helped us find everything we wanted to see. If you are going to New Orleans, then this is the guide for you!"
3,This Is an Old Edition,Be aware that this is an old edition (the current is the 5th edition) and thus no longer refers to the correct question pool for licensing.
2,out of date book,The book was out of date. It was part of a prevous question pool. It was not made clear it was not the curent manual.
4,Drums continue to be my beat,"While the 1960's drumming of Sandy Nelson may be a little dated, in 2009, all the power and verve of originality the performer intended comes through on the CD. Sandy's opportunistic style as a drummer may not be a technical achievement, but it was and is a performer's statement. Good on you Sandy, the drum beat achieved what you intended. Let there be drums. A fan."
1,Buyer beware,"I am totally discusted with this CD. I bought it for one song ""The Birth of the Beat"" - A wonderful 10 minute performance. When I played it, I found out it was a cut down version (3 minutes). Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed."
4,Great Music but missing one important factor,"The music is terrific. If you like the big band sound this is a must have CD. But if you want the beautiful drum solo on Let There Be Drums, you're in for a disappointment. It is an abreviated 3 minute segment of the selection. But overall I'm delighted to have the CD."
1,this is not for u or me,"Though my son is saticfied when he is with me, I was considering not breast feeding because of how little I was getting from pumping. I bought this pump on an emergency. I had a medlia and my ice pack leaked into the motor so i need a new one asap w/ little money to spend. After two weeks with this pump my supply went from 11oz(I was already complaning about)to 4oz in a whole 10hr workday. After reading I'm not the only one having trouble with it I will stick with breastfeeding and upgrade right away.Wish I read these first hope it helps someone avoid the hassle, just buy the best. Keep in mind even if it is for temp use the settings are from one extreme to the otherlow-i couldn't even tell if it was onmed-tickled causing letdown but suction to weak to get milk outhigh-felt like my skin was tearingif i could have given no star i would have"
1,"This pump should be recalled, it's trash!","This was the worst breast pump ever in my opinion. It looks good, and honestly it does feel comfortable when it works. How ever the motor is terrible, it only worked for less than 3 hours total use time before it lost suction. They have bad customer service, and of course you can't return it and get your money back. I had to go back to using my medela manual breast pump for a while until I purchased an electric medela breast pump on ebay that I really love. My friend owns a lansinoh and she loves hers as well.The playtex system is a great concept because of the soft nipple shield but that is all, it is just ""a concept"" because the product does not work. I am really disappointed with playtex for not maitainig their high quality standards in continuing to manufacture and sell this pump knowingly ripping people off."
1,Junk/ great disappointment - do not buy it,"What a great disappointment. I got this pump as a gift and oh what a nightmare. I have been trying to get it to work for several weeks. I have pumped with a Medela manual pump and it works like a charm. After 10 minutes I have 4 ozs of milk, but with the Playtex piece of junk I get nothing and sometimes maybe 1 oz after pumping for more than 10 mins.My sister recommended the Medela electric pump which she has been using since she had her daughter and she recommended getting one. What a big difference. It cost more but it is the best pump ever. I can get 4 ozs in 5 minutes.My advise to anyone who needs a pump is DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYTEX PUMP.She has contacted playtex, they sent her new tubings and a new pump and it is still a piece of junk. Playtex needs to remove this from the market.This is only for those who have milk pouring out and do not need a pump to get it out.I wish I had check the reviews on Babies R Us before I bought this piece of junk."
2,You get what you pay for.,Invest in a pump with features that are better customized. This pump does not achieve maximum milk flow.*Update* after a little over a week of using this pump twice per day it has totally konked out. The suction stopped working. I will contact Playtex and see what they can do about it.*Update* Playtex is sending me new tubing and another motor. This seems to be a common problem with this pump. Save your money and purchace another pump. I would change my rating to one star if I could.
2,Disappointed,"It worked ok the first few times I used it, but it seemed to just keep going down hill from there. It's loud, slow, cumbersome to deal with the bag and bottle, and twisting the pump off to get lid on. I only ever used one side at a time, can't imagine the lack to suction had I tried to do both. And I really had to press the pump hard against myself to keep the seal. Thankfully mine was only a gift, but I will not be keeping it for next time. I honestly doubt it would still work by then."
2,Wrong edition - disappointing,"Once son got to school, instructor said this was too old an edition. Thought ordered the 1994 edition but this is a much older 60's edition. Disappointed as now have to purchase another book and hope the correct one comes. will not use this seller again. Book does not even look like the pic noted . Thought it would be okay but too old and need to have the metric versions and the added drawings as in the newer book"
3,An adult's view,"First the bad: story not totally believable. So-so acting by adults. Dialogue n eeded a rewrite.Now the good: adorable child actors. Interesting, if not totally believable, story. Excellent photography and beautiful scenery. Fine transfer, though DVD has limited extras.All in all a pretty good deal, i.e. for the budget the thing probably was shot on. Overall a good effort."
2,ok for a kid's movie,The plot was shallow and the acting could use a bit more improvement and that says a lot about the director. The director should have encouraged better acting!
4,enjoyable,my 6 year old grandaughter loved it...........my 3 year old one thought it was a bit scary when the kids were kidnapped.......
5,Singing the Blues in the Sunshine,"This CD contains both the hit version and an earlier version of Gale Garnett's signature song, and it's interesting to compare the subtle differences, but Garnett was primarily a Blues singer and listening to this album can cause the impressionable to want to sit in a tub of warm water and open their wrists -- not because it's not great, but because it is. ""The Prism Song"" and ""Sleep You Now"" add a whole new dimension to bittersweet. And ""Malaika,"" sung in Swahili, is a special treat. The worst song on the CD is good, and almost all are unique treasures."
5,Gale Garnet CD,"I love her singing, and this CD was just what I was looking for! I couldn't find this CD for the longest time...and it came so quickly and without any problems."
3,the album is ok.,Album is ok. Don't remember any of the other songs. I bought it for the title song as it holds a special meaning for me.
2,Is this art deco?,"Regardless of you own personal ideas concerning the aesthetic of this product, keep in mind it is harldy an art deco lamp. Where are the step-backs? Where are the chevrons? What are these curvilinear forms that scream art nouveau and the whiplash line? Don't be fooled, this is not art deco."
5,Sauter Finegan-The Best Of,"I love ""Hit The Road To Dreamland"", ""Child's Play"" and ""Nina Never Knew."" This music is timeless. There have been few musicians since the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra who could arrange such well-composed songs."
1,Horrible,I am happy to see this has been discontinued. It is the most horrible chidlren's CD I've ever heard. The lyrics are horrible as is the singing. I would never play this in my classroom or for any of my children. There is one song that is simply just OK.Very dissapointed!
5,LOVE IT,"My little brothers loved these songs when they were children, and they became fast family favorites. After talking about them at a family dinner a few weeks ago, I thought I'd try to see if I could find them for my children to enjoy as well, and was SOOO happy to find these. My kids are in love!!! Glad I could carry on the ""tradition""."
1,Not impressed,"The book was very cute, the description gives the imppression that it is longer.I read the entire book in 3minutes. I dont feel it was worth the price."
1,"This is not ""art metal.""","I'm a big fan of many ""avante garde"" metal bands such as Mr. Bungle (one of the greatest bands out there), Tub Ring, Dog Fashion Disco, TOOL, etc.. But this should never be put in that category. This album is way too pretentious, not artistic or ingenius. These are talented musicians (some are former members of Idiot Flesh), so why can't they utilize their talents to make actual music. 1997 is the only good song on the entire album. They should have written more songs in the vein of that particular one."
2,"Dude, no!","This disc has two wicked pieces (one star for each)...""Sleep is Wrong"" (brilliantly annoying), and ""1997"" (bad lyric idea buddy)...anyway...i'm keeping it but only because I like bad music and my local CD shop will only give me three dollars for it...it's worth at least 5 (dollars, not stars). It ain't Bungle, but your dog may hate them equally (thank goodness mine is deaf)."
5,Blown Away,"I discovered this band while browsing someones' files... and I'm literally in shock. The doctor says I'll be fine, as long as I don't listen to this album again. Boy am I in trouble. I just can't help myself...See, I'm not a big metal fan, or screamo, or... I just think these guys are scary good. Kinda like Frank Zappa meets The Fiery Furnaces at a party and starts playing Metallica. Or something not like that at all.You will either love this or hate it, but I guarantee that you won't be indifferent."
2,not what I was hoping for...,"Based on the brief review in the All Music guides to both Soul and Blues, I thought this was going to be material from their early Vee-Jay period.Not at all! It's hopped-up post-Stax R&B;, with Larry Graham style slapped bass & heavy drumming. If that's what you're after, this may qualify as 5 star material. As for me... I'd rather drink muddy water & sleep in a hollow log. Not that I don't like Stax R&B; and Larry Graham, just not in this context.In the typical ""Collectables"" tradition, there's no info concerning when or where this was recorded, the band, or any details as to who wrote any of the songs.(But if you want some great 60's Gospel, the Collectables Vee-Jay two-fors of the Staples are highly recommended.)"
1,Outdated Product,I received my order only to discover that the boxes were past the expiration date. negative starts to this one
2,Breaking bits and dead drills,"What's the saying? Three strikes, you're out? Well, this is the 3rd time this drill has died on us. The first one was under warranty and died during light use. The replacement died out of warranty, also under light-moderate use but we were able to get it repaired. This time, I'd just started drilling holes in to brick and after breaking two bit tips, the drill just died. It had been running for less than 2 minutes with breaks for cool down. There wasn't any telling smell of burnt motor, so its probably another electronic problem. I was able to finish the holes lickety-split with a small 3/8 corded drill.There are some serious design flaws in this equipment. Worked great for serious wood drills, but we won't be repairing it again. It's clearly undependable."
1,"Cynthia, Home Owner","I purchased this 1191VSR SR# 981002032 and it stopped in the middle of my drilling a hole in wood! It is only about 2 years old, moderate use, kept in the case, clean and dust free. I called the product recall line, it is not on recall. Then I was told I could talk to a technician. Ok, first, I was on hold too long with the product recall line, not a good sign. If you have to be on hold that long on a product recall line because the operators are busy then their products are not worth buying. Never again will I buy a Bosch product. I have a Hitachi drill and have owned it for at least seven years. It still works and better than this Bosch thing. Don't waste your money on this Bosch drill! Oh, and my mistake, I did not register the product, so basically I was told, oh well. If your product is the best people can buy, then you stand by your product and you don't give them the run around. Again, I am never buying anything from Bosch again.Cynthia B, Plant City Florida"
4,Carmal,"I like these shoes, however the rhinestones on the top of the shoes causes my stocking to snag, and in my opinion the shoes are too dressy to wear without stockings,"
4,The Happiest of Holidays,"""Happy Holidays Love Barney"" is a happy collection of songs. It is light-hearted and fun. The list includes such standards as ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" along with other songs such as ""Suzy Snowflake"" and ""Hey, Santa Claus"" which are seldom heard. Many of the songs are sixty to ninety seconds long and hold your attention. I like Barney's side comments such as when they are singing about Rudolph not joining in any games, Barney says ""oh, my!"" and also when they are finished with ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" Barney goes ""Pheww!"". ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" carries the listener along. The voices of Barney, Baby Bop and BJ, along with a children's choir, keep the song fresh. Hanukkah and Kwanza are both represented with ""My Dreidel"" and ""Habari Gani"" respectively. Overall, this has been one of the highlights of the Christmas season!"
3,Cute but...,"I agree that the VHS or DVD would be a better bet. The CD is very upbeat and fun, but there is quite a bit of dialog, which for the younger set, may be more entertaining in a visual format. However, if you are looking for a terrific CD for the car, and your little one loves Barney, then this is a good bet.Cris Cunningham"
4,the begining of rap,this is one of the frist social relative rap albums back when it was real. the songs are raw and porfane.
4,Solid Debut for this long overdue master,"Curtis Fowlkes can funk, jazz and swing. Highly recommended"
4,"Great, even if not quite as described","Turned out perfect for us. Excellent design, nicely made and perfectly finished. Detail: table is made of welded sections of extruded aluminum tubing, making it very light and strong. Description says ""cast aluminum,"" which it's not."
1,no screw threads...,I finally got the xbox 360 controller faceplate and when I was putting the controller back together I realized that the faceplate that I had just boughten doesn't have any threading inside the screw holes. This results in it being impossible to screw your controller back together so it does not stay together very well while playing. DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOUR POSITIVE THIS ISSUE HAS CHANGED!
2,The finish doesn't hold up...,"When this piece showed up, the finish was a perfect mirror, it really looked incredible. Installing it involved disassembling the controller which was a pain but not too difficult. The screw holes in the new faceplate didn't seem threaded as the screws were nearly impossible to get started. Overall, the install was something I don't want to do again.The finished product though made me feel the whole ordeal was worth it....however, after 20-30 hours of gaming, the finish started to fade. Now, after 60 or so hours, the sides of the controller where your palm contacts the faceplate, is a grayish white with no chrome left on those sections. Anywhere on the faceplate where your hands/fingers come in constant contact, such as near the thumbsticks, has no chrome finish left.If you are a casual gamer that digs mods, it really looks great. If you plan on puttin in some hours, I'd look to a different product."
5,An outstanding Book about Whitetails A+,"If you are looking for a book about Whitetail's this is the one to get. This book has amazing pictures, ( my favorite is a shot of a mature buck charging across a small river with some does and smaller bucks trailing behind) and a wealth of information about all aspects of the life and behavior of these majestic animals. This book will be loved by hunters, nature photographers, hikers, or anyone who wants to learn more about deer and/or view the best whitetail photography there is."
5,Sony DVD (DVPNS55P),The DVD player is easy to install and the picture quality is excellent.The remote and the player's front panel controls are user friendly. Very pleased with this product.
1,Piece of junk...,"I purchased this unit two months ago on the basis of good prior reviews. As of today it is non-functional and is useful only as a slim, trim paperweight. It will simply not play without breaking up even after following suggested correctives in the manual. I believe the DVD tray is not lining up correctly, but it's simply not worth investing any $ for repairs. I suggest spending a little more upfront and purchasing a simple unit that works."
5,Very nice buy!,"We found this DVD player to be easy to set up, no problem to use and have been enjoying this quality product."
4,Great Christmas gift,This DVD player was a great gift for my parents. Their old DVD player would not play all DVD's so they wanted a new one and they love this one.
2,Poop,"This product is damaged. It was poorly packed and the face was broken off when I received it. Also, title says black. Its not, its grey and all scratched up! On top of all of that there is no remote and/or cords. Thank you seller, you suck."
4,Sony DVPNS55P,"If your looking for a DVD player with a great picture, this one is for you. Basic operation, simple to use, nothing complicated, not loaded with extras, just plays a great picture"
5,Sony single disc DVD player,The Sony single disc DVD player lives up to the glowing reviews that were published in the Amazon website. It is simple to use and provides excellent quality pictures.
2,"Not very original, but a good read.","Body of lies by Iris Johansen is a good read. The female lead is not always believable, her motives seem a bit contrived at times but the book doesn't really suffer from any of it. I felt the villains were a little flat, not having any real motives but the old reliable greed for more money. Surprisingly the story still held my interest. It has a mellow rhythm that allows for quiet enjoyable reading. The suspense is there, but not the break neck pace. This is one you can read in bed and be entertained, but still manage to get some sleep."
1,Tried twice...but no joy,Interesting premise...but no meat...no sense of physical place...almost all dialogue and that thin and not interesting enough to be memorable OR to fill in the story...thought I'd give it a second reading just to be fair...same/same...Don't waste your money
1,Body of mediocrity,This was probably the worst book of its genre I ever tried to read. I had never read anything previously by Ms. Johansen but the favorable reviews were tempting. What a disappointment! The writing was poor and the plot was ridiculous. Did Ms. Johansen never listen to a 12 year child speak. The dialogue which came from Jane's mouth in no way evoked a child's speech. The dialogue of the adults was pitifully pedestrian. There were no descriptions to conjure up any sense of atmosphere. One hundred pages of this drivel convinced me that there was no hope for anything better from this book so back to the library it went. Glad I did not waste any money on it.
2,Flimsy plot,"Starting a series in the middle is always tough, but I'm a firm believer that readers should be able to enter the path at any point and feel welcomed. Johansen does a good job of giving enough of the backstory on her characters (forensic scluptor Eve Duncan, her adopted daughter Jane, and her live-in love Joe Quinn) that I understood what was going on.She also set up an interesting plot line -- a body-less skull, a mysterious letter in the mail, a betrayal by Joe -- that I was pulled in immediately.Unfortunately, that's where the good parts end. Eve is a narcissist who seems to act with little regard to her family, the other characters seem to exist solely to serve her will (doesn't Joe have any passions or needs of his own?), and the plot was splotchy and haphazard. Twists and turns appeared without any apparent foresight by the author other than, ""Wow, this will fool 'em!"" I was left with more questions than were answered. Not a good end to a mystery."
2,"Iris...Iris...if you don't need the money, stop writing",I've been a fan of Johansen's for years...she has always delivered a good (sometimes great) light read. But she is really starting to telephone it in.You can almost hear her ticking off plot twists here--and what has been a compelling situation (Eve's anguish over her lost and murdered daughter) turns into a convenient way to get those plot twists...uh...twisting.I have always bought her books new--but having just read this one and seen what reviewers on Amazon say about the follow-ups...think I'll check one more out of the library to see if she can redeem herself.
1,eve is tough?,"Gosh, she's tough. She's one tough lady. We can tell she's made up her mind,and she's tough, so she won't change it. She is so tough.....that it takes at least 4 men to protect her, and all she does is whine. Her daughter, Jane, could be sweet, but she is given no friends and such adult dialogue that she doesn't provide the relief this book needs. The last chapter was interesting."
1,My Last Eve Book,"Actually, it's hard to rate a book that I didn't finish, but it's so seldom that I don't stick with one to the end, I guess I owe it at least one star. I had read the two previous Eve books and had enjoyed them. I was, however, quickly disappointed with a plot that was too far-fetched to be at all believable. The dialog was redundant and unrealistic, especially that of the twelve-year-old Jane. Yes, some preteens are insightful and understanding, but Jane's comments and actions are more appropriate for Eve's mother than her daughter. I will read another of Johansen's books but not another featuring Eve as the protagonist. Galen, perhaps, but definitely not Eve. (Oops, I didn't finish the book. Perhaps Galen met the same end that at least four other characters had already met by page 144!)"
2,What Happened?,"I am on page #110 and so far, the entire process has been painful. Has Ms. Johansen always written this poorly? There are no definingly manners of speech in her characters. One would think, -beings they's all from da South- we would hear a touch of a drawl on occasion. We really have to make sure we know who is speaking at the moment, because all the characters sound identical.The overall emotion is too bland-as though everyone is on some kind of prescription tranquilizer.I remember enjoying her past novels but this one just plain old hurts to read.If this was an attempt to meet a deadline it is a shame. Her writing has suffered for it."
3,"An OK book, but not a keeper",I love the Southern Louisiana area and enjoy reading anything set there. I was also fascinated by the details on how forensic sculpting is done. This book was a decent mystery just not one of my favs.
1,Quick Review,"Eve Duncan is a forensic sculptor, specializing in recreating heads from skulls. She has been summoned to the bayous of Louisiana to identify the remains of an unknown murder victim. She has barely begun her work when someone close to her is killed. What follows is a frantic race to finish the skull recreation and identifying the body while trying to avoid those who do not want the victim identified.Unoriginal story (secret world-wide organization that uses its power to plot the course of the world, anyone?) with uninteresting and unsympathetic characters. Even the dialog was annoying."
3,"eve, eve, stop your wallowing","ms. johansen weaves a great tale, but eve has got to get it together. thisis not healthy my friend! the books real good though!"
2,Not Well Written at All,"Ms. Johansen keeps trying to combine a love story & a thriller. It doesnt work. The thriller/mystery part of the novel is very good. The ending isn't great; but it's good. The title fits the story perfectly. Please, Iris, stick with that & develop it.The personal love story part reads like an elementary school primer & ruins the novel. How many pages can be devoted to the same soupy lines in the middle of life threatening situations? Throw in a 12 year old girl who has the mind & dialogue of an adult and it just helps the book to fail even more.Johansen's books (I have read 3) seem to follow this scenario. Alas, this is my last one. It's unfortunate. If she stuck to the suspense & thriller section, the novels would be very good. Leave the soupy story to another sort of novel.Buy it used at a cheap price, borrow it from the library, or just take a pass on it"
2,"This is one to get from the library, not from the bookstore","Though I've normally enjoyed Iris Johansen's books in the past, this one fails to pass muster. The plot is rather far-fetched (3-4 persons out to illuminate and destroy a secret society comprised of world leaders) but it could have worked if the writing was more vivid/emotional/passionate. In actuality, the writing was flat and emotionless; Eve resembles more a bitter and sarcastic has-been, than the smart, sassy, and intelligent character she portrayed in her previous books. For instance, when a helpful FBI agent was killed in a car bombing, ""Eve turned and looked at the burning car. Poor Jennings..."" and then ""Eve nodded numbly. She was so stunned...."" ""Poor Jennings"" to ""stunned"" was quite a reach. You'll probably want to read it because of the past characters you've come to know (Eve, Quinn, Logan, Jane, and Galen), but save yourself the [money] and check it out of the library."
1,please give her some writing lessons!,"I liked the plot. But PLEASE! The writing! Ms Johansen is supposed to be a WRITER! The heroes don't just sigh, they constantly ""draw a deep sigh"" (every time they get which is a lot!) Question: Why does Eve often (too often!) ""moisten her lips""? Does she suffer from some unknown disease? Why does she or Joe or Galen or everybody else never ""look"" but ""gaze"" - and frequently(!!!) ""OVER the SHOULDER""? And how many times can Joe just appear and stand in the doorway? English is not my native language, but I love and respect it. Ms Johansen apparently, does not. Is the rule number one in writing not to repeat the same word twice in a row? Ms Johansen, did you know that? I love to read, but this book is not a ""good reading"". I am sorry"
1,What has happened?,"I have read all of Johansen's books and until the last one, loved them all. This book is just plain awful. No plot, no dialogue, Jane is a silly character, Eve has grown boring. If it weren't for Joe and Galen I would never have finished this book....I don't know what has happened to the writing...perhaps she is being forced by a publisher just to churn out books to meet a deadline. I am sorry to say that this may be my last Johansen book."
1,Dialogue Confusion,"The plot was very good, but I could not tell who was talking and who was being talked to during most of the book. As an avid reader, I was looking forward to reading an easy-to-read, entertaining book before getting back to something heavier. Boy was I wrong - I am not accustomed to so much dialogue confusion. The book was poorly written and I do not recommend it to anyone."
5,I love this body,"This book really became my best friend for the last couple days. I had to lie to my wife and say that I had a headache, i was really feeling Iris Johansen's groove here! What a lassie, she pulls every punch and hits the clown right square in the nose this time! I really enjoyed the telling suspense and the trifled mutilated story line that brought about the best in my own tears. I hadn't wept so long since I accidently closed the garage door on my cat. And how this story progresses to the ultimate end of our beloved main character, the liar...and this body sent me out of this world!"
3,Interesting but sometimes confusing,"I almost did not get started with this book because in the first 5 pages it jumped around so much that I had a hard time keeping up with what was going on. I did eventually get interested in Joe, Eve, Jane, and most of all Galen. His character definately has the most personality! The occupation of forensic sculpter was also interesting. I wish that there had be more going on with Joe and Eve. I think they could have had a better outcome of their situation. This was my first time reading Iris Johansen."
2,Not up to her standards or my expectations,A boring story with annoying character conflict. Eve is torn up after discovering Joe's lie. It's obvious they'll get back together -- but not until we slog through hundreds of pages of her angst.
1,"Trite dialogue, zero description","I thought this book was terrible. I don't understand why people think this author is so amazing (unless they have really low IQ's). Yes the subject matter was interesting but the delivery was very poor. I showed it to a friend of mine and she said, ""She writes like she learned to write from watching TV."" The novel is all dialogue and very little description, which doesn't equal up to an interesting read for me. There was little suspense, I was not sympathetic to the main character, and the attempt at romance was a joke. You want some real suspense in a mystery revolving around the legal system? Go read Grisham."
3,More like a passing grade 3 and a half.,"Iris Johansen's ""Body of Lies"" is a fairly entertaining novel.The cat and mouse aspect is well done, as the hunted do not use super human powers to keep on the move. As the story progresses, a ticking clock subplot propels the action.A secret society lends an almost credible conspiracy theory to the mix.Throw in a resourceful hardboiled British bodyguard with a dubious background, a corrupt Senator, a seemingly average reporter, a skillful assassin and a covert research project involving fuel cells and things move rapidly.Forensic sculptor Eve Duncan is terrific when doing her job recreating the face on the skull of an unknown murder victim. When fretting about her romance everything bogs down and becomes a pitiful soap opera.Colorful villains, some wolves in sheep's clothing and the nefarious secret organization keep Eve and Atlanta detective Joe Quinn hopping and the pages turning.The ending was too pat."
4,The Body of Lies,"This novel was an excellent read. I wasn't able to put it down once. She made this book a wonderful suspense. The plot was excellent, by introducing the troubles in people lives and there sacrifices to cope with bad experiences. I'd recommend this novel to everybody who loves learning new things."
4,A Great Continuation of a Series,"Great Book in the Eve Duncan series. Don't forget to check out THE SEARCH too. Amazon.com doesn't mention it on the series list, but Eve, Joe and Jane all make appearances in that book too."
5,What a wonderful book!,"I wasn't too familiar with this author's other work, so I didn't really know what to expect when I started this book. What a wonderful surprise! Scott Philip Stewart weaves together a heartwarming (and sometimes heartbreaking) story filled with characters with whom you can relate...and empathize. Everyone knows couples who have tried every imaginable way to conceive a child - IVF, etc. - and the exhiliration associated with finally having one. This book draws you in with just such a couple, living in unfortunate circumstances, and keeps you pulling for them through a series of twists and turns. You have a front row seat as you witness the power of love, hate, raw bigotry, redemption, and high-minded idealism. Ryne will tug at your heartstrings, and you'll think about him long after you put this book down."
5,Berkeley protests,"This documentary is a fabulous, historic account of protests in Berkeley, the reasons citizens revolted, how some protests kindled into large events that cut across racial boundries."
4,A Vivid History Lesson,"Lots of incredible original, quality film from the 60s. It's amazing that the producers turned up so much. I'd recommend this disc to anyone to see it.Interspersed are talking heads reflecting on their time in ""the movement."" They are well-spoken and fairly inciteful. Some appeared in the vintage footage, a couple were leaders.The commentators occassionally offer self-critiques but we do not hear anything at all from those who were on the other side of the societal debate, so the film is very sympathetic to the left.It does go on a bit too long. Probably, they should have cut much of the segment on the Panthers and saved it for another film. Although it was one of the most insteresting parts, it was a bit of a digression in a film that I think should have been edited with more zeal."
2,Boring,"I am very sympathetic to the""movement"" of the Sixties, and took an active part in it, but I find this type of ""talking heads"" documentary boring as hell, even though it is interspersed with news footage.An example of a truly great documenary of the time is the film ""The War at Home"", available on video (1979, director Glenn Silber)."
5,Truly Amazing!,"I can not describe this movie except in one way. I am a student, when I go to class I normally end up falling asleep whether it be with a TA lecturing, the Professor lecturing, or even a movie. However, this film...wow! I actually watched the whole film, and wrote a few papers on it, and referenced it my final. No BS!No matter who you are I would reccommend this film HANDS DOWN!"
2,A little tempermental,"Ok, this machine prints nice labels, but, it's tempermental... 90% temper 10% mental. And, man is it stupid! In this day and age of user friendly devices how can something that prints labels and wastes 80% of the tape tell you the label is too long and then make you guess at how long you need to make the tape to make it work? I don't get it. Couldn't it figure out how long it needs to be??? And, why does it have to waste so much tape? If you get to use 20% of the tape for actual printing you'll be lucky."
2,"Ok, but could be much better","I agree with the previous reviewer. It is tedious to input without a QWERTY keyboard. I don't like the key touch. It feels rubbery and occasionally a keystroke doesn't register.On the plus side, it can do a double line which is handy when you doing long labels for a file folder label.I found the long spaces before and after the word very wasteful and I had to cut EVERY single label again to get the size I needed. That feature should be adjustable."
2,Don't bother - buy a QWERTY labeler,"I got this as a Christmas gift, but I'm going to return it for a better labeler. The ABCD keyboard is annoying, if your going to be making a lot of labels and are able to type a labeler with a QWERTY keyboard would be much faster.What really annoys me about this labler is that no matter how you set the margins, it always leaves a half inch of white space before the text. You can't use the built in trimmer to trim off the excess. You have to go and find a pair of scissors and cut of the extra tape. You end up throwing away at least 25% of the tape which is quite expensive."
3,Very Good but Not Quite Great,"I purchased this movie for the opportunity to see Vincent D'Onofrio. I enjoyed the movie, though it was slow at times. Someone looking for action, adventure, or a fast-paced story should look elsewhere. But this is a well played coming of age tale with strong performances by all the young actors involved. Vincent D'Onofrio and Jodie Foster are in supporting roles and show the strength and subtlety of their craft by playing the characters as *supporting*."
3,'Altar'ed States,"Yeah, I'll admit this movie has potential... it just seems to blur out from time to time with stupid plot twists and one dimensional characters. Whenever the film grabs you, it takes a turn in the wrong direction. (Namely, the cougar incident. Which was ridiculous from the moment they started scheming and plotting.) I liked Kieran Culkin's character... it's just too bad we don't really learn anything about him...All in all, it was fair, seeing as how I didn't expect much walking into it. Script was kind of interesting... direction was nothing new or impressive, but still passable... cast was capable. Characters were just abysmally under-developed and, at times, extremely hokey and unbelievable. And cheezy, hokey dialogue doesn't help matters, either. ""When you look at me, I can't breathe.""One more thing... I kinda dug the marriage of animation and live-action in this film. It just seemed to work well enough here."
3,Bland movie,"This is a rather bland movie. The content definitely recalls my own youth days and the dangerous lives my friends and I led, but I find the storyline trite and the acting bearly tolerable. None of the actors really got into their roles, especially Jodie Foster who as the ""evil"" nun has no character whatsoever. One of the supporting boys (the one who's not in the ""trinity"") is perhaps the most memorable character as your stereotypical small-town, all-American kid. All the other characters are easily forgetable. The animation sequences are indeed unique and well edited, although I'd seen this technique used in much earlier Japanese and Hong Kong movies; and the stuff here starts out well but gets boring when they approach the ""pearl.""This is definitely a rent title if you want to relive care-free youth days."
2,Unconvincing,"This film was well-intentioned but ultimately unconvincing. I didn't mind the inclusion of the animation scenes. But their effect was to reduce the amount of time on the live-action parts. As a result, the character and plot development aspects seemed very rushed and unconvincing. The twists and turns came totally out of left field. The acting of Kieran Culkin and especially Emile Hirsch was very compelling, particularly the non-verbal aspects... though I didn't really buy into Jodie Foster's performance as a hard-nosed nun. This isn't a totally irredeemable movie, but the carelessly rushed character and plot development made for a disappointing end to what seemed like a promising film. I actually give this film 2 1/2 stars but that choice is not offered."
1,Don't waste your money,"What could have been an entertaining story about four boys from the Catholic schools growing up in Savannah, Georgia, was turned into a boring flick. This is not a ""Stane by Me"" or ""A Boys Life"". I kept waiting for it to get better but it never did. The animated comic book scenes only distracted from the real plot of boys against the principal. Did Hollywood want this to be a drama or a comedy? It was neither."
1,No Redeeming Value,"The makers of this movie and the parents of these actors should be ashamed. This is soft teen porn, totally depressing: Incest, teen sex, suicide, alcoholism, drug use, vandalism. Jodi Foster's worst performance ever...not believable at all. What's the message here? Depression? Skip it!"
2,Disappointing,"As the product of a Catholic education, I really wanted to like this film, but I intensely disliked it. 90% of the reason that I disliked this film was because of the young actors. They are absoutely terrible and annoying actors playing terrible and annoying characters! They provoked no sympathy or empathy whatsoever for the characters they portrayed."
4,Lovelorn Troublemakers,"A beautiful coming of age story, sure to delight the adolescent male concealed within each and every boys' adulthood. Culkin's performance is right on as the meddlesome Tim, while Emile Hirsch brings mature insight to his portrayal of the lovelorn Francis. The cinematography is reminiscent of a town time has forgotten. Full of desolate cemeteries, mills and industrial factories, the bleak surroundings are nothing more than a landscape of trouble for Tim and Francis. McFarlane's comic book translation is well crafted and blends well with Tim and Francis' tragic tale of youth. For those without patience, these interwoven stories may prove challenging. But with patience, you'll grasp their metaphoric dance, appreciating the foreshadowing and symbolism."
4,As Only Youth Can...,"-This Heavy view into the teenage psyche brings humor, despair, and young lust/love together in a distorted way that only adolescence can successfully accomplish.-To explain further: It is a darker male version of ""Now and Then,"" that digs deeper into youthful tendencies that mainstream teenage bubble gum movies try to avoid.-Watch this with friends and be prepared to find certain aspects of this film refreshingly disturbing; a quality that sets it aside from the rest."
4,Different,"I really enjoyed this film. Enough to go out and buy it. Jodie Foster was great as a one-legged nun! If you get uptight easily and let's say ""American Beauty"" offended you....you probably don't want to watch this one. For all others...a must see!"
4,A nicely blended treat...,"An intriguing mix of drama and comedy, this witty outing blends the controversial with the acceptable rather well. Basically, this is a story of teen angst done with the charm of adolescence kept squarely in mind. The cast is young and impressionable and they come across with convictions beyond their years, especially Kieran Culkin, who had a stellar year (with this and `Igby Goes Down'). Hirsch leads the film with admirable conviction, although he is one of my least favorite in the cast. At the end of the day, `The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys' is not the film you'd expect it to be. It is fun and knows not to take itself too seriously, yet it never forgets that a good lesson learned makes a much needed impact."
2,Lazy Script,"about 1970's bent catholic school boys. The last 10 minutes is a pathetic avoidance of character development. I also found the exact details of the teen girl's sexual history impossible to believe. Finally, the nun and priest were bland cardboard cutouts. The animated scenes are great but way too short."
2,Not Enough Crime Solving,"Have read several books in this series. The interaction and personality dynamics among the main characters is quirky. My enjoyment of the books varies by the degree of mystery solving as contrasted with character ""studies"". My preference is for the ""who-done-it"" element which is less in the earlier titles.In parallel with a review at the ""3"" level on this book, a substantial degree of this book is the interaction among the main characters with many philosophical aspects thrown in. Per my tastes, this book combines too many different elements among the characters which was confusing in some places and boring in others. The story practically minimizes the mystery solving to the point of being ""bland"" inlcuding the continual references to the fact that the police are struggling to make any headway.These are light mysteries which are entertaining as such. Still, I'd recommend putting this one on the back burner over many of the others in this series by this author."
4,Step by step bird's eye view of the 1996 LPGA season,"I enjoyed traveling along with Jim Burnett throughout the 1996 season. He explores the history of the LPGA, past controversies (Ben Wright), and the present lives of tour veterans and rookies. A great read for someone who wants some biography, some technique, some of the business of the tour, and a behind the scenes look at the nature and condition of wowmen's golf today. Good Book!!!"
1,I wish i could rate ZERO stars!,"Bought this book before i moved out to phoenix, now i live in phoenix, what a waste. The authors who by the way live in Vegas, probably were here no more than a few months and rated places that either comped them or i dont even know. They rate the best pizza pizzeria unos in the Arizona Center (I was surprised to see they didn't rate McDonalds for the best hamburger). They rate victoria's secret at best lingerie place, anyone who's ever been on mill knows where the best place is for that stuff. This book was no more than an enlarged detailed yellow pages."
2,Poor Packaging,"Unfortunately, this bike arrived damaged. The front forks were bent. It was not double boxed nor were the front forks adequately protected. Amazon return process is really good."
3,Reads like a textbook,This book is a text book. It has good exercises to learn from. It is a little difficult to use as a reference book. It could use some more tables and examples.
1,"PM, RN WHO TANS","I have tanned for years and this absolutely the worst lotion I have ever used. I am fairly dark complected and use the tingle lotions to get the best results. This lotion has no tingle, I have got absolutely no results from it. The only thing I manage to get was the stains on my hands from applying it that last for days and made my hands look dirty. I would highly recommend anyone from this product, it was a waste of money and is useless."
4,Nice Romance/SciFi,"Here we have an amusing, complicated alien world. The crown prince abducts his bride and decides not to tell her who he is and see if she will love him for himself. She has been convinced by the order of Sauron Knights...of which she is a member...that the crown prince is a barbaric, evil brute who she is responsible to help overthrow. The book frequently refers to plot changes in terms of a chess match.There is a great deal of humor, a somewhat convoluted plot and some action. I laughed a good deal and overall enjoyed it very much. I am looking forward to more stories set in this new and enjoyable universe"
2,Great potential that dies....,"Prince Tarrant-Arragon of the Tigran Empire always gets his way it is his destiny as the future Emperor. When it is found that there is a remaining virgin Djinn it rests on his shoulders to mate with her to protect the royal race. The problem is that he is on earth, is the daughter of a rival and a human and doesn't want anything to do with him.The prince also wants to have a mating with someone who doesn't loath him in fact though it is his ""right"" he has never ""deflowered"" a virgin to date. So he cooks up a plan and with a couple of trusted guards as well as a few hired people sneaks onto Earth and kidnaps Djinni-vera. He doesn't tell her who he is and just goes by the name Tigger. Even though, he knows she loathes the prince. The story follows their growing love and the shock when Djinni-vera finds out who her Tigger really is.I thought I would love this book. But, after 2 tries I still haven't made it past page 80. Just could not keep me interested!"
2,How can a book be funny and really boring at the same time?,"How can a book be funny and really boring at the same time? I kept trying to read it, putting it down, picking it up again, etc etc. Finally got to the end. Maybe 10 pages worth of stuff in the book was really cute and well written... the rest was dull dull dull... and the cute stuff was sprinkled so thinly that it kept you thinking something good was just about to happen. A come on rather than a read. Unpleasantly so. Too bad because the author is obviously intelligent and could write something interesting. I'm just about burnt out on trying though.Now, if you want some really excellent and intelligent space opera, try the Liaden Series by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller. I hate to speak of them in the same breath, but they really do all this book promised and much much more."
2,Just not up to snuff,"I found ""Forced Mate"" in a used bookstore in perfect condition. This is never a good sign. I'm selling ""Forced Mate"" back to that used bookstore in perfect condition.I really enjoy futuristic romance, but this book was just plain poorly written. All bluster and no follow through, inconsistent personalities, borring hero, and bland leading lady."
2,Disappointing addition to a great genre.,"I hate to give a bad review to any new futuristic romance since it is my favorite genre and new ones are hard to find, but (you saw it coming, didn't you?) I simply didn't care for this one.The plot was confusing. I never figured out where the characters were coming from and; thus, none of them could ever really ""grow"" on me. It's not the worst I have ever read and I DO like this genre, so I give it 1 extra star."
1,lousy,i have not received this purchase yet over a month later and the company has proved nearly impossible to deal with. i would not recomend it to anyone
5,Read a future classic now.,"While the entire collection is notable, I have to say that ""Two Serious Women"" seems to me to be the real masterpiece here. I read it ten or so years ago for the first time and liked it but found it rather dark. I re-read it a few years ago and liked it much more than I had the first time, finding it hillarious, albeit darkly. I was happily surprised all over again by the unpredictable behavior of the characters. Unlike many novels, this one is almost immediately engaging, with its portrait of the young Christina Goering's religion-obsessed childhood games. Jane Bowles is often lumped in with her husband; but her writing, though less voluminous, is more unique, more inventive. This is writing well worth repeated reading."
4,A teasing frustrating pleasurable game,Sounds easy but is difficult and requires a lot of strategic tactics. We all loved it and got frustrated at times
3,nothing special,"It works decently for me, but it isn't extremely powerful or anything. I mainly use it as an extra driver for wheelchair ramps where it keeps up with a master mechanic 18v driver."
4,worth the money,the product was a good for the moneynext time amazon might ask there sellers to ship in an amazon.con boxif this item has to go to a state prison it needs to come in a box that says amazon.con on it
3,Great buy,"I was very pleased with the quality,price,delivery and sales transaction at Amazon. I have never been disappointed with Amazon."
2,Not up to Bosch standards.,"I recently purchased the Bosch 1005VSRK drill. I have a Bosch jig saw and am very happy with it. I figured the drill would be the same quality as the jig saw. Wrong! When I tested my new drill I found that about 50% of the time it would start smoothly and slowly as a variable speed drill should. I found that the other 50% of the time the drill would hesitate then suddenly start up with quite a bit of torque and the speed would be fast. There seemed to be no way of knowing which way the drill would start which is a pain if you're trying to start a hole in a very precise place. I was very unhappy with it, and returned it right away. I then did what I should have done in the first place. I bought a Milwaukee 3/8"" Magnum variable speed drill. I am extremely pleased with it.In regard to the Bosch drill I've learned that this unit is made in Malaysia, and it doesn't seem to be up to Bosch standards. When it comes to this tool you better pass this dog up."
1,Poor quality,"I bought this as I was very impressed with their jig saw, which I have had for 3 years. This drill is a very weak product and I would not recommmend it for anything other then extremely light use. I am contractor and this tool was getting lots of use for fast, light drilling jobs. For the heavy jobs we use our 1/2"" milwaukee. After three months the internal reduction gear stripped while drilling a 3/4"" hole (this drill is specified to handle up to a 1"" wood hole). I considered it bad luck and replaced the gear for $... 3 months later the cord shorted out where it enters the drill. Again changed same and then 2 months later the chuck broke. I was very disappointed with this drill."
3,OK for limited use,"I picked up one of these drills thinking that the ""Bosch"" name meant that I was going to get a drill comparable to the other fine Bosch tools I have. This Malaysian tool was so disappointing that I have already returned it. I am a carpentry contractor that will use a tool like this only in a pinch, so it was never intended for heavy use. But after using it to drill a few pilot holes (20 or so) and driving in the screws, the trigger assembly was hot, and I was concerned that the drill would burn up. I now have the comparable DeWalt, and am happy."
4,Final Justice,A strong look back 30 odds years to the days of Aids phobia. Another disturbing view of how the Law system can be manipulated for the worst. It is without doubt the best acting I have seen from Michael McKean.
4,"Slightly Less Helter Skelter, But Slightly Better Effects","Inferno is yet another great Argento film. Though I think Suspiria scores higher (5 stars) for it's quicker searing helter skelter moments, Inferno is only slightly less so. Inferno's pace is actually different altogether, with the victims piling up at a rather steady clip. Of course, there's Dario's signature nightmare moments where reality seems to disintegrate into a dream passage for mysterious reasons, and as always his timing of suspense scenes is impecable. This film does score slightly higher for technical achievement of special effects; the underwater and death mirror scenes are classics. I only wish the lame brother had bought it, cause he's no keeper. Can't wait for the third film in this trilogy so I can watch them togther."
4,a macabre surrealist dream,"Dario Argento's second installment in the (as yet unfinished) three mothers trilogy. It takes place in the same hyper, dream logic, over saturated color world first introduced in Suspiria. Argento plays the same games with space and time as H.P. Lovecraft does in some of his short stories. By merely opening doors or turning corners, characters move from recognizable worlds of physical normalcy into screaming nightmare worlds that defy both logic and physical reality. A truly wonderful movie that should not be missed by any fan of the bizarre. Hopefully a widescreen version will be released soon. (Hint Hint)"
2,total nonsense,"total non-sense. my least favorite of the three mothers triolgy because it really makes no sense at all. there is no main character and just one weird situation after the next. visually its great and it has the classic Argento sensibility, but its in no way a rewarding film."
4,a somewhat incomprehnsible masterpiece,"Well as most of you already know, you don't watch Dario Argento's movies for substance. You watch them for style. This movie delivers with bright vibrant colors and imagery, hooded figures, devils, beautiful women, and a really mean hot dog vendor. I find myself drawn to watch this movie over and over again, if only for the neon lit rooms and underwater lairs,Argento has displayed throughout.The plot, involving a brothers search for his missing sister in a house of evil, is a follow up to Argento's Suspiria(another much lauded film) that follows the tale of the three sisters( a witch cult or something even more sinister-of course never fully explained)If it's explanation your looking for, go elsewhere, but if your looking to be entertained by vivid kills and unusual set pieces,you might just want to set up shop in the House of Inferno."
4,An Argento Nightmare on Film,"Dario Argento, director of ""Inferno"" has compared his film to watching a nightmare. The film certainly is very dream-like with very stylish and haunting images. Plus, there is a distinct lack of logic to the film. The plot does not make much sense and seems to be built around a series of lengthy and cool murder set pieces. The ending is rather abrupt and anti-climactic. The film is definitely an exercise in style over substance. Still, the movie looks great and contains many very haunting images and murders. Worth watching once but I don't think I will ever revisit this film in the future. I love a film with a good plot."
2,I don't get it....,"Before you guys come out of the woodwork and start yelling at me about how great Argento is, I love his work. And this piece, I just do not get. Suspiria was a great movie, I was ready to turn this one off after 30 minutes. My DVD cut out before the last 15 minutes, and I didn't care. It's a much more artistic piece, yes, but I don't even understand Argento's imagery. The acting was worse than godawful, not that Argento's films are known for that, but this was really bad. I didn't really care a thing about the three mothers, there was no suspense, I do not understand all the great ratings this film got. Maybe i'm missing something..."
2,Stick with Suspiria,"I already knew before buying this movie that I wouldnt like it, atleast it comes with Phenomena wich is alot better IMO. Inferno is not one of Argento's best at all and doesent even deserve to be known as a sequel to Suspiria. I like all of his films espesially the gallio ones but this just doesent hold up to his other work. It does have all his imagination but not his style. Pick it up with Phenomena and maybe youll like it but I doubt it."
3,Not bad but somewhat outdated.,"First of all the dvd quality is mediocre. The picture quality is barely vhs standards and the sound is dull and very flat. Now about the movie: The murdering scenes are good and the end is gripping enough especially the transformation into death. I love the soundtrack. What I do not like too much is the persistent tone of blue, red and green in every image of the movie, it make it look somewhat cheesy. Overall: DECENT."
3,One of Argento's best?,"i don't see how people can consider this one of Argento's best. i have a version of this film already and can't see myself buying some new release or special edition of the film. if you already own the film i'd recommend not buying another copy... one of his best?... Really? people that like Argento should try Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Suspiria, Deep Red to name a few. of course if you don't have this film and want the trilogy of the three sisters you have to get this to complete the trilogy(along with Suspiria and Mother of Tears)"
2,Infer-NOOO!,"... Inferno is not-definately not an enjoyable movie. Ihonestly wanted to give the film a higher rating than 2 starsconsidering the massive signature Argento stylistic input but theplot/storyline is just completely unbearable. The slow pace and nonsensicle structure is unforgiving and the film leaves you drained after watching it considering all of the questions you'll ask yourself about the movie. Unfortunately the film never-NEVER EXPLAINS THE ""PLOT"" FULLY. While this is a known factor of Argento films, the plot in Inferno is unacceptable! It's the absolute most annoying Argento has ever conjured up!... Still, Inferno features some nice visuals and the dubbing is really cheesy-but in a stylistic atmospheric way. Inferno is a work of art but definately not a good movie. See to only admire the visuals (or become bored to death) *2stars!* END"
1,Inferno,"What is it with Italian Horror?Not all but the majority,I have seen Suspiria and I liked it but Watching Inferno is like watching some spoiled college kid's Experimental film for film class.The dialogue,dubbing and the usual doesn't make sense story is not my problem,The Man who has an evil way to get Rid of Cats doesn't bug me despite my Feline Fancy(I love cats-But Animal Rights activists are just silly treehuggers.)It just seems not an horror film but a badly made soap opera or drama with bad effects and despite the lack of usual Italian Style Gore which to me is always overdone and lacking in taste the movie just doesn't do it for me on a scared level,and I have seen Several ""Scary"" movies especially Italian variety."
5,fun toy for preschool to early grade ages,my 4 and 7 yr old enjoy playing this game. they can set it up and put it away by themselves. they're careful to pay attention as the game goes along. this is a nice quiet game that is great for 2 or 3 players to teach taking turns and concentrating.
4,A fun time,"My kids, ages 6 and 4 played this game over the summer with two other kids their age and loved it! When we bring it to other people's houses kids of all ages join in. I now have a few extras to hand out as presents:)"
3,"GREAT GAME, Shoddy Construction",I bought this game to use in therapy and took it along to play with 4-5 year olds. The game is just like Kerplunk but with adorable monkeys. Would it kill game manufacturers to spend a bit more money on the pieces that need to fit together? The base of the palm tree has attachments that are tiny and the tree pops open if enough care isn't taken when inserting the sticks. The base itself doesn't attach well either. The palm pops open quite often and has to be reattached frequently. I'm thinking of gluing the sides together to prevent this.
4,Great fun for little price,"This was the perfect toy for my 4 year old who is currently obsessed with monkeys. Simple and easy to understand for younger kids but I could see it being boring for older kids. She loves the game, can easily set it up herself and we bought it for only $13.00 which I feel is a fair price for what you recieve."
4,Cleaning is a breeze!,I enjoy using this cleaner since I don't have to worry about chemicals or harming hte environment...and it has a light citrus scent as well.
1,terrible quality,"not at all what i was hoping for. terrible quality, the screen is cheap and poorly put together. i paid way too much... how in the world is this thing marked down and still 120?"
4,Excellent and a half,"Free jazz during the 1960s did not mean hard bop disappeared, far from it. Eric Dolphy worked with Oliver Nelson, Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones took days off from Coltrane's vortex to work hard bop dates.Lee Morgan's Gigolo is a great example of great playing outside the avant storm. This is blues based jazz with fantastic playing.All the passion and fire of the best hard bop is here-this is no run through. Some of the playing, particuallarly the panio, is just a little more harmonically open than it may have been five or ten years earlier, and this only increases the dynamic tension of the music.Gigolo is not the cutting edge of jazz, but it is some of the best of any era."
4,Great Jazz Music,"Good and strong classic B-Bop, I've heard of Lee Morgan before just had one of his CDs and this one just strongly compliments his Sidewinder CD. Great jazz music."
3,Not the Best Lee Morgan,"OK, I'm not a music critic or Jazz expert but I have to say, I was disappointed in this album. I was motivated by Mr. Morgan's work on the early John Coltrane albums. This album lacked the excitement and interest demonstrated in those sessions. Like the rating says, it OK..."
3,This is a hard game for me!,I'm 17 years old and i can't get past the swimming with turtles! I don't understand the game! It didn't come with instructions and do you have to get to level 11 to pass the turtle swim?! I have the game that came with the dvd. Otherwise this game is alright if i could just beat it! or atleast play sumtin else than turtle swim! :D
2,A Very Dissapoiting Game,"As A Fan of The Film ''Finding Nemo'', I Wanted To Play The Game. But Once I Played the Game, I Didn't Find It Fun At All.The Visuals Were Poorly Made, and Both The Locations and Carecters Were Looking Very Wierd and Odd.The Voices Weren't That Great Either, Even if Thay Were The Ones From The Film.The Levels Act More Like Mini-Games Insted of Standerd Video Game Levels.The Music Wasn't Really Good Either.Overall, The Game Didn't Do Much of A Good Job of Being Fun or Entertaining and It Wasn't Worth Playing.Overall Ratings:Game-2/5Visuals-1.5/5Voices-3.5/5Levels-0/5Music-0/5"
3,"My son likes it, I can't stand it","We bought this for our five-year-old, who loved the movie. Why is it that all Disney games turn into annoying (and cloying) lead-ins or promos for the movie? Why do we have to watch endless clips of it? The games seem kind of uneven (some way too hard, others too easy), and sometimes the software seems to get 'stuck' (we need to back out and repeat the objective to get it to work). I like THQ and their software in general, I've just noticed that anything Disney-related gets bogged down in their desire to ""Plug the movie! Plug the products!"" My son does like it when he plays it, but it's been used a LOT less than I had anticipated. Gets 3 stars for good graphic and audio quality, but I'd give the game itself a two."
3,Nemo's Underwater ----Special Edition,"If you play the game that comes with the DVD, keep in mind it is only a DEMO version, with access to only two sections: the EAC and the Tank Gang. There is nothing on the paper sleeve or in the readme.txt to indicate this, I thought we had a defective disc until I visited Disney's cdrom support online. ahh well, at least it was free."
2,Finding Nemo,My husband came home with the Finding Nemo Viedo that he got our son as a gift it had the Pc game Finding Nemo underwater adventure. It didnt tell us that this was a Demo game. My son can only play the race game with crush and listen to the tang gang sang songs. We thought we were getting the hole game the two games he can play are fun but he gets bored really easy. If the company wishes to give away free pc games on the viedo's in the furture please let people know its a demo or give them the hole game. I wish that the game was the whole game since its not I wish I could take it back.
1,i got this game and.................,this game sucks. its way to easy and the graphics suck too. i love the movie but the game is terrible! im 10 so i realy should know better. i couldnt return at all. my mom was pleased with the game but i wasnt! so i gave it to my brother who is 5. my mom got me madagscar instead. i love it. atleast someone is enjoying my game. kids over 4 would use the disk for frisbee so think befor you buy!!!!
2,I wish I could return it!,"This is my opinion on Finding Nemo: Underwater world of fun. I bought this game for my 3 year old son thinking it would be worth the money. I really thought it was going to be as great as the movie. What a dissapoinment!!!! It's too easy and the graphics are awful. My son was very excited at first but got bored quickly. There is not much to do, its very repeatable. This software supposed to be for kids 4-6, but I have no idea how 5 and 6 year old will continue to be interested after passing it once. I know there is another version rated for children 6 and up, but I'm not sure if I want to get it knowing how poor the graphics and sound are. There are much better games out there."
2,WARNING: BIG EYE STRAIN!,"I think the Finding Nemo Game has some good points: 1) superior graphics, 2) fun educational games that teach visual memory identification, pre-geometrical strategies and hand-eye coordination. BUT, the ""Swim Challenge Game"" is a huge eye strain! It cannot be stressed enough that this portion of the game NEEDS to be redesigned! Having the background moving constantly is extremely tiring, not to mention painful to ones' eyes!"
3,It's only a demo that comes with the DVD,"My 5 year old son was more excited about the game rather than the actual movie, however once we got it home and loaded I was greatly dissappointed. We were able to conquer the first adventure and then were not able to find any others. We searched and searched and even restarted the game many times. Finally, after an hour of trying to figure out what was wrong, I went to the website to find, to our dissappointmen, that it is only a cheap little demo. It seems like it would be a great game but Disney definitely should have stated that it is only a DEMO."
3,Ground rod driver,Does what it's made to do. Made well and will hold up for many years. This is just what your Bosch needs for those heavy jobs.
1,Ground rod driver for big hammers only,"This tool only fits demolition hammers as it has a 1 1/8"" shank. Will not fit SDS or SDS Max hammers."
2,Not Soothing At All!,"I bought this CD expecting it to be wonderful to listen towhile practicing yoga or meditating. I was really looking forward to it, since I love Indian chants and sacred songs. Unfortunately, I found Paul's voice to be strange and disconcerting, the melodies were odd, and there was an atonal quality to the music that made it grating and hard to listen to. Not at all what I had hoped for either, and for this listener at least, quite difficult to relax to or practice yoga with. I wish it hadn't been so, but I agree with the other reviewer who said it wasn't what they expected. Ravi Shankar's Chants of India is a much better CD of Indian Chants with better voices to bring out the sacred aspect of the words. Paul's voice just didn't seem to fit this type of music, which is a shame, since he has been immersed in it for years. Strangeand disappointing, and not what I would expect from GAIAM, either."
4,the return of hard-rocking music,"Killer guitars. Awesome lyrics. And superior studio production. Atello's new album, ""The Big Payoff"", supplies these and much, much more. Check out the cut ""Grip On My Heart"". If you close your eyes and open your ears, you'd swear you are listening to early BON JOVI. What a treat! My personal favorite ""Full Moon Fever"" is best listened to late at night, cruising down the highway on a warm summer night. Check this album out and let Atello show you what they can do!!!"
3,Baby Lupah 2213,"The quality of the watch is quite evident. The watch looks expensive and like it would last for quite a while. However, I found it to be too large (in the depth size) so I returned it. I had to be an inch high."
4,King Roy!,"I once considered spending about a grand on a tube compressorfor my stereo system. The sole purpose of the expense wouldbe to remix and lift up the vinyl version of this classic album.This re-release is exceptional. I am not a audiophile and canrarely tell the difference between anolog and the so called newand improved versions. This Boulders release is a differentanimal. The mids have real punch! The song 'Rock Down Low""has the power it was intended to have. I wish the planets wouldalign themselves and get Roy and Jeff Lynne together for a newrelease. I hope the same folks who remixed this classic willre-do the Split Ends lp too. Buy at the great amazon price andenjoy. mike"
3,Pretty good but uneven,"I love Roy's earlier work (the Move, ELO's first), and this too has some gems. For me it has slightly too much of a novelty, so for couple of great songs (Dear Elaine obviously, Songs of Praise, All the way over...) there are multiple so-so ones. I think Roy's talents & knack for perfect pop gems really benefited from competent and even competing talent by his former bandmates; this is (I assume) what made pretty good stuff absolutely great. Move was a super-group with extremely talented bandmates, not just a great songwriter & multi-instrumentalist.Still, this is not a bad record and maybe I will fall in love with it over time."
5,Inspirational for all children,It allows disadvantaged children the courage to both look for and find their place in a world which they have felt left out of. In the land of ICAN everything is possible!!!!!! All children need to know this truth. The Flying Frog Circus helps show them the way.
4,missing track folks,"How come no one has yet noticed that the wonderful track ""michael has golden hands"" is missing from every compilation? what happened to the original album cover with the lovely womans profile, wearing the beaded cornrows....."
2,Hello???!!!!,"I love Odyssey.Especially ""Native New Yorker"" ""Inside Out"" and ""Don't tell me,Tell her"".But.... am I the only one tripping or did anybody else notice that those are not the ORIGINAL VERSIONS.I don't know about anyone else but I NEED the Original versions."
4,Good compilation. Includes complete track list.,"I'm not sure if these are original recordings or re-recordings. ""Native New Yorker"" sounds updated, but it could have been a remix of the original version.Complete track list (16 tracks):""Native New Yorker""""It Will Be Alright""""Inside Out""""Use It Up, Wear It Out""""When You Love Somebody""""If You're Looking For a Way Out""""Going Back To My Roots""""Don't Tell Me, Tell Her""""Easy Come, Easy Go""""Ever Lovin' Sam""""Hang Together""""Each Day I Fall In Love With You Again""""You Never Really Had It At All""""Joy (I Know It)""""I Just Can't Believe It's True (I've Lost and Found You)""""Shades Of Blue"""
4,They got the melody,"A great disco band, they were best known for the hits ""Native New Yorker"" and ""Use It Up, Wear It Out"", but the 1981 ballad ""I Got The Melody"" is probably the most beautiful song the group ever recorded."
4,Wedding Song,Wedding Song is the story of a Jewish girl growing up in Iran. It is well written and a interesting account of her life. Easy to read and definately recommended.
3,Too ecletic without originality.,"The New Yorker's Alex Ross thinks Golijov is the savior of ""new music."" He is talented indeed,and the combination of Cuban, operatic, Reichian strands is well done BUT this is too much like a combination of Carl Orff (Carmina), Reich (Tellhelliim) and Pablo Milanes. It simply does not hold up to repeated listenings.Jon AppletonArthur R. Virgin Professor of MusicDartmouth College"
2,Jesus Christ Super Estrella,"Some beautiful moments, but...Latin popular music done up in the classical tradition comes off as a conceit, and the staginess of the choral parts feels oddly enthusiastic. ""Hey, let's put on a show"" rings false here somehow."
2,Does the job,"Works well in collecting the dust, but it has a sharp plastic ""backbone"" in the thing that chewed through after only minor abrasion. That is why I am giving it a 2. Best advise would be to wrap the plastic in tape to prevent abrasion tear through of the bag."
3,Region code matching,"I tried to play the film on my DVD player, suitable to play region code 1 DVD films.I was prompted, that my equipment is not suitable for playing this film.Dead end, I couldn't play the film on my DVD player.I ordered together with ""Hombre"" the film Gia, and I could play it without any problem on the same DVD player, as I did it with many other region code 1 films before.(I had encountered an other playing problem with an other film, ordered at the same time, the ""Quest for fire""(prompt there: PG code setting, even the code was set to adult.See my rating of that film too)Best rgrds, Jozsef Szucs"
1,Doesn't Work,"This has got to be one of the worst Westerns of all time, on a par with some of the 60's Italian offerings. The script is ghastly, the acting is absolutely terrible. I am not a Paul Newman fan, as I believe he has always been highly over-rated as an actor, but he outdoes himself with bad acting in this movie. Richard Boone sorrily plays his usual predictable part, exactly the same role he played in ""Big Jake"".I hate it when a director takes a movie that could be entertaining and ruins it by trying to make it a PC social commentary. And that is exactly what happened in this movie."
3,Hombre,As with all Paul Newman movies this is a Good movie!! IT could have used more Action!! The plot is good just a bit slow to get moving!!
5,What's with the blood?,"This is a simple review of Hombre. It's just great. I would never miss it on TV even though I have the tape. One of Paul Newman's best parts, not to mention Richard Boone as the very, very bad guy. He makes me shudder every time. It's easy to hate the part played by Frederic March too.Now to the question, when Newman shoots the first outlaw from the top of the stage coach, the blood seems to be painted onto the movie frame itself, NOT on the man getting shot. No one ever mentions this in any review or movie goof or Hombre trivia. Does anybody have any comments on this? It fascinates me every time!"
2,Wait until later,"This DVD reminds me of the earliest CDs. The technology is there, but the artistry is not. The sound quality was very poor, even with my TV hooked into my stereo. While I wasn't expecting to see the actual videos (though that would have been really great) the still pictures they pasted on the screen were few, and none were from the videos. Guess I'll wait a few years until I buy another one of these."
2,Not very serious.,"Once you die, your compositions can be used to say what you have not said when you were alive. It's not serious to record and sell a piece that Nono had not premiered during his life. The publisher has not the right to make money with ""Da un diario italiano"", composed in 1963/1964, 26 years before Nono's death. The performances are not marvelous. And the booklet is full of missprints: ""Scabia Giuliano"" instead of ""Giuliano Scabia"", ""fianto"" instead of ""flauto"", ""Archivi Luigi Kani"" instead of ""Archivio Luigi Nono"", and so on. The cover says that the pieces are sang by the SWR Vokalensemble Stuttgart under Rupert Huber, but omits the WDR Rundfunkchor Köln, that, according to the third page of the booklet, is the performer of two out of three tracks. Coherently, the booklet does not mention who conducts these pieces or who plays the percussion, but informs us about who has prepared the WDR choir."
3,Its got great instrumental,I loved the instrumental.. it rocked... and it was original.. in its context.. though the singing could be improved upon... though i love hard rock... its not just yelling.. you kinda gotta have the voice for it... Ive been listening to Paradime a new group.. but becoming popular around Oklahoma... they've got good instrumentals.. but the vocals rock... completely...anyway.. i like the originality.. its hard to find new and fresh talent nowadays....I gave it three stars though because i think the vocalist needs to keep practicing... anyway like it or not thats my review....
1,No ... No... Not more of this alien nonsense,"When I saw this on TV a few years ago I thought the film was pretty good. When I saw it again on tape I knew the thing had to be fake. I'm giving the content of this thing a lone star. But for faking, editing and hoaxing viewers, this deserves 5 stars for sure. Whoever put this thing together should be employed by Hollywood or some spy agency - good on ya mate"
1,Fact or Fiction? - well Fiction I'd say,The question is asked: Is this fact or fiction? I'm sorry Cmdr Riker but you haven't proven the case of fact at all. What a poor showing. Alien Autopsy + No evidence + No scientific theory + Faked film = Fake. In my mind this is a Fake.
1,BS,What a load of BS this is. There is nothing here that is convincing at all. No science; no confirmation; nothing. I'm sorry but this is rubbish
1,Totally Agree - Stupid and Dumb,Dumb and Dumber than anything Ive seen in years - I'd rather see an x-files show than this trash
1,Aliens do not look like that,"I have been abducted by aliens two years ago, and what I can tell everybody is that they do not look like the one shown in the film. They have bigger head and eyes, the fingers are different and their bodies are thinner It is a good try, but far from the reality."
1,Stupid,"I can't believe they showed this on television as a ""documentary"" piece with a host and background commentary. I would have expected better from the host - being a respected personality I suppose. These things are are so easily forged and faked and nowadays with computer animation and superimposition I think people are alot more skeptical and cynical of alien stuff on the tube. I think the piece would have worked if the scientific community were involved in the production and commentary. As it stands, its nothing more than background noise in a room full of sci-fi fans and trekkie conventions. This could have worked in the 1970s but not now with your x-files, star trek ripoffs and nova who-done-its."
1,Off the Wall,Absolutely an off the wall video. It comes off like a serious documentary but winds up being a laughable figment of somebody's wild imagination. Gotta hand it to the producers though - they made a wild flick - Yuk. Do an autopsy on this baby 'cause it died the night of its' release.
1,Do Not Adjust Your TV Set - We are controlling transmission,"The stupidest thing I've seen in my entire life. I laughed the whole way through. Who knows why I watched it - maybe for the same reason I watch Star Trek Voyager - stupid, dumb and downright assinine, partner; total mindnumbing nonsense - pass me the beer and chips honey - oh and by the way - CHANGE the channel - I think the Simpsons are on."
1,Stupid,Star Trek and Alien Autopsy - perfect. The producers of this farce had everything in the bag on this load of garbage. I mean if the thing is real does anyone seriously think they could cover that up for 50 years. Geez gimme a break No.1 I think we can dispose of this thing on the trash heap of cheezy sci-fi cross-over more indicative of Chariots of the Gods and Zeacharia Sitchins' space aliens from another world.Luke! help me take this mask off! May the force be with you. God knows Frakes needs it after this poor showing. More stupid than the weather balloon thingee.
4,"See it, but don't expect an answer","If you happened to see this ""documentary"" when it first aired on FOX and were aware of the controversy that swirled around it, then there is nothing new here. If you didn't, and you happen to be a UFO buff, then you must see this despite the constroversy.Is it a hoaxed ""recreation"" or an actual autopsy? There's no way to know. Awkward camera angles? Who cares. Period ""prop"" pieces or what happened to be in the room at the time? There's no way to know. Incredibly complex human-like dummy or actual cadaver? Who knows. Human with an exceedingly rare disfiguring genetic condition, or recovered alien body? Who knows. If it is a human, then why no recognizable internal organs? If alien, why the humanoid physiognomy?Either this is the rarest, paradigm busting, ground-shaking footage ever released, or it is a cash cow for some unknown hoaxers. Either way, there's nothing else that even comes close to this seeming ""holy grail"" of ufology."
3,Retraction: Autopsy Footage is included,"In my previous review of this item, I stated that the 20+ minutes of ""autopsy footage"" included as a bonus on the VHS and Laser Disc releases of the film is not present on the DVD. This is incorrect. Although the PACKAGING makes no reference to the bonus footage and lists the program running time as approximately 46 minutes, the ""autopsy footage"" is indeed featured after the end credits. My original review has been deleted with apologies to those who were misinformed.(Speaking of misinformed - aliens may well exist, but THIS is fake. Santilli admitted so a few years back. Still an entertaining little piece of fluff, though.)"
3,Skeptic,Well you are pretty much left to make up your own mind.The footage is archived very well and all the instruments seem to be within the 1947 period. But the camera mans inability to get the best shot when the surgeon is sawing open the head starts to give the footage away as being a hoax.But why put together such good footage then do something like unprofessional camera work.A navy camera man backs up the conclusion as to why the camera man doesnt get the best shot. But i'm still skeptical because the camera man could have stood on the other side of the surgery table and recorded the cutting of the head or the cutting open of the body. Instead he moves in to close and the picture goes fuzzy as they are hiding something. Why doesnt he stand back the image would then not be distorted. It seems strange to put together some really good footage and then when it comes to the best shots the image becomes blurry.
2,Alien?,"I was always amazed at how closely the alien resembled Newt Gingrich. ""Fake-umentaries"" should be clearly labelled. When this was released, I sent Jonathan Frakes an email saying how disappointed I was that he had associated himself with such a dubious project."
1,PROVED TO BE FAKE!!!!,Ray Santilli admitted that he faked the entire thing! Check the WIKIPEDIA! The whole thing is a hoax
1,Unrealistic!,"I am an alien, and having seen this ..., now understand why wegave your planet a wide berth eons ago. My head is a different shape,my fingers are longer, and the eyes are all wrong. Surely only the stupidest of humans could be taken in by it! END"
1,exciting and logical,i would like to see this vedio to find the answer about the question which say do you belive that there is another life out the earth where we live? really i want watch it but i dont have the money thats but please i want to know i read much about this subject so i want to see please.......at all thanks for raeding
3,Is it all that it can be?,"I'm an avid gamer and rpg's are my focus. After picking up the Xbox, my next goal was to aquire a rpg worthy of attention and detail... along comes Crimson Sea. At first glance, the artwork is wonderful, the levels are beautiful, and the characters actually have character. The hardest part of the experience was adjusting to the first person shooter feel. There are enough baddies to keep both you and the Orkin man quite busy. The game play is quite linear, and once a quest is completed, you can't go back to the area. You do have the option of selecting which quest to complete, but there are no side quests or freedom of movement within the game. There are a few annoying quests that deal with a timer, invisible critters, and a pushy IGA guard chasing you around... it gets old quick.Over all, this game was fun to play, however it was quick to finish and is definitely a rental. I do look forward to more titles by KOEI and this gives me hope for future rpgs for the xbox"
2,Crimson Sea,The game is really fun but you don't get to choose through that many weapon which is one of the down sides to this game another downside is the game is to short it only took me two days to be it.The game has some awesome graphics and stunnig backgrounds but if you are a kid I would recommend a different game because the game can be very difficult at times. At the end of every level you get money to but new gun and items but again there isn't that many guns but the guns do go up level to become stronger and the guns are really a pain because some a short range and long range. Soon as you buy a gun you will not be able to get your money back. So if you don't like games that are to short don't buy it or if you like games with stunnig graphics well then buy it but don't get mad when you beat it in a short time.
1,I'd rather. . .my self then watch this movie again,I saw this movie at my friends house. I didn't laugh at anything. Not even once. The whole movie is based on a Dog. A Dog that somehow knows english. It is just a HORRIBLE MOVIE. Why doesn't Amazon have a 0 star rating! This movie deserves -10000 stars!
5,One of the funniest movies ever!,My Mom and I watched funny DVDs to get me through recovery of major surgery. This is one of the funniest movies of all time! I almost laughed my stitches out! I always have top notch service & delivery when ordering through Amazon. Thank you~~!
2,Love the Movie! Didn't like the DVD,"We love the movie See Spot Run. Would have liked to watch it, however, the disk that we got appears to have set in water for some time as it is warped and will not play. Very disappointing."
5,Cute movie. We have a bullmastiff puppy and this was fun for the family,Cute movie. We have a bullmastiff puppy and this movie is fun for the family. We enjoyed it (even the adults).
4,See Spot Run,What a movie!!! It was very good and my 11 yr old niece loved it. I'd recommend for a family night movie session.
5,See Spot Run,Great Movie! Funny and enjoyable. I wish Hollywood would make more of these type of movies.
3,Laugh-Out-Loud Family Fun!,"Although the critics picked it apart with a 1+ star rating the movie clearly deserves 2+.The laughs keep coming and hardly stop once this movie starts, if you don't like laughing then I wouldn't see this movie if I were you because you'll be in hysterical mode FAST.But it is a comedy so don't expect any life lessons or teary moments cause' you won't find them in this movie."
5,Great Movie,This is the movie that made me fall in love with the Bullmastiff. I happy to say that me and by Bullmastiff MAX watch this movie all the time.
2,could'nt be an chessier than dog,when i saw this film i was a little dispointed for instance they the writers did not give the film enough comic depth & things for actors to do so it was drag for me to watch cute maybe for kids but for single moviegoing adults this may bore you although david arquette gives an amazing proformance despite the awful script he was given better save your money & rent this dog if you dare .
2,"Cherokee, not Cheyenne","Mr. Gorman writes a good Western fiction story. Lots of action and a good story line. He is a professional, for sure, but why in the background discussion of the story does he place the plains Indian tribe, the Cheyenne, living in the Carolinas and suffering on the Trail of Tears, when anyone with any knowledge of American history knows the Cherokee Indians suffered on the Trail of Tears. My wife is a card-carrying member of the Cherokee tribe and falsely stating the Cheyenne were there is a real glaring error in my sight. Wrongly placing the Cheyenne on the Trail of Tears has no bearing on the story about the Federal agent and his search for the gatling-type gun in the story. It just reads as if Mr. Gorman thought it would be an eye-opener to put the Cheyenne there instead of on the Great Plains. You know, make you wake up if the story is beginning to put you to sleep. If you can get by this BIG error, perhaps you can get through the ""rest of the story."""
2,Buy it on EBAY,"The video doesn't even focus on Maryland for the most part. It seems they already had 3/4 of the video done before the end of tournament, then they could just throw in the championship stuff at the end so they could sell the 'official' video before anything else came out.The previous reviewer made some excellent points. I really just wanted to second the opinion."
1,Ugh.. this was bad.,"I like championship videos, but this one was awful. Clearly a product of 'quick-to-sell' marketing by CBS. The previous two reviewers were dead on with their comments."
1,"Statues, not figures.","I bought this when it first came out as it had the only Professor X figure at the time. Unfortunately, this Hall of Fame is just a collection of figures stuck to bases. You cannot remove them (from one of the product images you can see the results of someone who tried). It's fine if you're looking for a nice display, but if you want the actual toys you're bettery off looking for them one by one. Yes, I did end up returning this item."
4,"Good brace, provides support","This brace did a good job providing support for my knee in a squash tournament, where I did a lot of lunging and lateral movement. After four surgeries on my knee (one of them an ACL repair), there is nothing short of a total knee replacement that can prevent swelling, however this Cho-pat did a good job in preventing further injury. The exposed knee area provides a little more mobility than a covered sleeve would, and the flexible straps are more forgiving than a hard brace. The reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5 is due to a little slipping down after perspiration. Minor readjustment was necessary from time to time."
5,Great knee-savers,"My knees have been a problem for more than 40 years. I had a total knee replacement 11 years ago (and many surgeries before that). None of the braces or supports did that much. Then I was told about Cho-Pat Dual Action Knee Straps. I have worn them ever since whenever I exercise, and they really hold things together, without a big deal effort of putting on a brace etc. I am thrilled to be able to do Tai Chi and ride a bike without pain or worry about buckling and falling in the middle of exercise. Highly recommended."
5,cho-pat,"This knee strap is amazing. I'm on my feet all day at work and have knee problems. After wearing the cho-pat the pain in my knee was completely eliminated. The support from the cho-pat really takes the pressure off your knee. I was hesitate to buy it at first, but soooo glad I did. It really works!!!!"
2,not at all helpful,This product actually hurt my knee more after wearing it a few times playing volleyball. I was disappointed and went back to using the larger but better brace I got from my orthopedic surgeon... should have known better than to not go with the doctor's recommendation.
4,Karen Peris will break your heart,"I haven't heard this album, I've only downloaded ""Today"" from the Amazon downloads section. Since then I purchased ""Glow"" as it was the only IM album I could find. Anyway, the song ""Today"" from this album has become one of my favourite songs of all time. Karen's voice and lyrics will at once fill you with hope and at the same time break your heart...and you'll love it."
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"Subdued and mesmerizing in it's simplicity, this compilation of 'missing' tracks is a masterpiece in it's own right.More melodic than 'Birds of My Neighborhood',it is sure to enthrall followers old and new."
3,Taste in Waifs,"Depending on your taste in waifs, The Innocence Mission will either work your last nerve or send you into orbit. On Small Planes, a collection of ephemera spanning their 12+ year career, you'll experience both. B-sides feel minor by nature. With a band this consciously slight, these unreleased songs are like catching wisps of steam in a jar before they dissolve, which is both Small Planes charm and limitation. Karen and Don Peris, Mike Bitts, and Steve Brown keep these tunes floating, still, while occasionally taking off with amazing efficiency (""Today"", ""Something About Traveling""). Karen Peris's little girl choke of a voice expresses pure joy at the everyday, and her wonderment at the world in general is, now more than ever, a comfort. For the novice, their second release Umbrella is the place to start. Small Planes is an apt though lesser introduction."
2,"Sorry, but No.","I got this CD because I heard the song ""Today"" (track 4) and really liked it. After listening to the CD 3 or 4 times now, I can safely say that track 4 is the only thing on here worth listening to. I'm very disappointed."
4,Youthful exuberance,"A great collection of ""lost songs"". 10,000 Maniacs ""Hope Chest"" comes to mind as a point of comparison, but I would say this is much better. Not to slight any of the songs Innocence Mission recorded after these, but the feel here is a little looser and a bit more carefree, and the songs really benefit from the extra room they're given to breathe. I can only imagine this one rising in my estimation after further listens."
5,OOOHHH YESSSS!,"Once again so much musicianship and emotion from the small quartet. It feeds your soul like big skies and hidden streams.Karen's voice swirls and dances on the soft acoustic strumming laced with gentle electric pops of the diving fender. Ummph!, this is good music. If you liked glow, your in for a second feast! I know this CD will live in my lasertable until I've lifted all the juice from each note. Se la Vie!"
3,Good for people new to raw meaty ideas,"I have read many books on this area of pet health, and have used the methods with great success with four dogs over many years. I had read Tom's book ""raw meaty bones"" and enjoyed that so thought when I saw a kindle edition of this one it would be good to read too.The book was ok, and as I said would be great for people being introduced to the ideas found within. But for me the book lacked something. It might just be that I have looked into this method quite a bit already so it was just going over old ground I am not sure. It was easy to read and quick to read being only 90 odd pages long so it would be great to hand to people not aware of the health risks involved with commercial dog foods and the health benefits of a mainly meaty bone diet. But if you have looked into this before don't bother buying this one."
1,It's more like a brochure,"Save your self $10 and download the how to file from his website. It has about as much info as this tiny book. I was looking for answers to a lot of how-to questions I have regarding raw feeding. This book did not deliver. I already know why! Am sending it back and buying ""Switching to Raw"""
1,Yawn!,"I'll try to edit this when I'm feeling more eloquent, but basically: this book needed more meaty parts! I read it in one sitting, and found it about as solid as a pamphlet.I agree with the raw concept, but found Lonsdale's ""Raw Meaty Bones"" to be better for in depth discussion than ""Work Wonders"". Carina Beth McDonald's (name spelled right?) raw book is preferable for engaging the audience in a ""diet"" version of explaining the basics. Lonsdale's ""Work Wonders"" seemed a bit same old, same old."
1,Not again,"Another raw feeding book is on the market and this one doesn't add anything new. What bothered me the most was for all the hoopla, Lonsdale does NOT even talk about the QUALITY of the food you're feeding. What good is feeding raw if you're not feeding QUALITY and natural proteins?"
1,Nothing new,"Well, I am really glad I borrowed this book instead of buying it because I saved myself the 10 bucks. There's nothing new in this book. At least he doesn't go on and on about his political agenda like he did in the last book but in this one all he does is tell you to feed big pieces of bone and doesn't talk at all about WHAT you're feeding - as in the quality of food. Don't you think it's important to talk about that? I mean, is it natural and okay to feed your dogs hormone and antibiotic laden food for its entire life? Give me a break. I would would have expected more from someone who supposedly knew so much.Bottom line: don't waste your money."
5,Easy to read and understand,"Even for those who english language is not our native language, we have enjoyed Work Wonders a lot. WW is a very pleasant and understable reading. We had been feeding junk food for 10 years and now we have been feeding RMB's for 5 years now and WW makes me think that we are in the right way and we are sure of this, the health of our dogs is proof of that. The book includes a Risk Management chapter that I consider a great tool!We are looking forward to reading the spanish edition!"
2,"If you own Freddy Fish software, don't buy this.","It is very similar to it, as if format copied. My 7 year old daughter likes, my 4 yeard old son got it for birthday, we had it on our wish list, but he's struggling with it. The voice does sound like the original characters like Ellen DeGeneres."
2,Finding Nemo,Bought this for my grandkids. They are almost five and had areal hard time bursting the bubbles. I tried it several times and could not get past level 10 and thus could not go any further in the game. Not for early childhood and some older adults.
3,Maybe for younger kids?,"Great movie!! Average game. I bought this game for my 8-yr old daughter because she just loved the movie, and I thought she can extend that enjoyment with this pc game. One hour later, she had finished the game! It was too short! I read the manual book just to make sure we didn't miss any other levels of play, but no. It was over. It's a good product with great cut scenes from the movie, but I think the 4 to 6 year olds would be better suited for this software."
5,Can You Feel It?,"This CD Rocks! Vykki has a GREAT voice, and the band is awesome. They mix a little bit of everything in this CD, Rock, Blues, R&B, but in their own unique way. You will not be disappointed if you buy this CD!"
1,Don't waste your money,Not quite as bas as attack of the killer tomatoes but close. Bad continuity and even worse sound track. Worse thanthe usual sci-fi sludge.
1,What do retards do in the desert with their free time?,"Well, they could build a giant robot-mummy and march around chanting incoherently. Or they could make this movie. Really, this is an awful movie. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE cheesy, crappy movies, but I can't even give this movie _Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter_ props. They obviously had a decent budget based on the CGI and location shooting, but it looks like about 15 bucks went to the writer. Don't get it. Really. No, REALLY!"
1,"Oh,Nooooo!!!","THIS is the worst movie EVER!!!!My son is 7 years old and can make better movies with my camcorder,his acting is better as well...It is not worth the money.THEY have to pay ME instead to watch it again."
2,Typical SciFi channel sludge,"For a channel that continually gives us such tripe as ""Mosquito"" and ""Bugs"", ""The Fallen Ones"" is far from the worst that the SciFi channel has to offer. But as with most of their offerings, ""The Fallen Ones"" is devoid of a comprehensible script, Robert Wagner is horrible, and every few minutes you end up asking yourself, ""What's going on here? I'm confused.""But that's Ok, because the film is marginally saved by Tom Bosley, I gotta tell ya, you can put Mr Cunningham in any kind of movie, doing any kind of role and I'm going to be entertained.And you have to mention Caspar Van Diehm...we are living in blessed times to have this generation's John Agar meandering his way through B-movie after B-movie, he is so bad in an ""Ed Wood"" kind of way, that he almost makes you believe he's a credible actor.I liked the super-sized mummy, that was good imagination, unfortunately, most of the rest of the movie was lacking."
2,THE BIGGER THEY ARE...,"This made for Sci-Fi Channel movie harkens back somewhat to the days of the fifties cliffhanger serials. Unfortunately, it seems to take itself seriously and with a cast of bad actors and mediocre production values, it falls flat. While the premise of having giant mummies and fallen angels is initially intriguing, the poorly written script doesn't give us much different at all. Casper van Dien is stoically handsome and Kristen Miller coyingly cute, but vets Tom Bosley and Robert Wagner are pretty bad in their supporting roles. All in all, a mediocre, occasionally enjoyable romp."
3,"Stupid, but fun","This is one of those movies that has dopey elements (particularly the first 10 minutes), but the mid section is actually kind of fun. It's only when the giant man/mummy appears on screen that you groan and wish the creators had found a way to avoid the cheesy special effects. If you're in a silly mood and like horror-mysteries set in ancient tombs, check it out. But don't say i didn't warn you about the really silly looking giant."
4,"Available, though not on Amazon","i Googled this, and found it on another site:[...].I never got to see ""Tonka"" on tv or screen, as a kid all i had was a book of it. but i too was taken by the story, and it has remained an interest since then, perhaps sparking my lifelong interest in American Indian history and heritage. Also, not far from where we live here in Kansas, is the museum in Lawrence where the (badly) stuffed remains of Comanche are on exhibit. I always found it rather funny that he is positioned in his glass case with hindquarters facing the room, as though he wants to protect the many NA greats pictured in the case he faces."
4,childhood favorite,Loved this movie as a kid. Was fun to see it again. beautiful horse and a lesson in kindness to animals.
5,Great Movie,I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid. I loved it then and love it now. Disney at it's best!
5,Tom Pacheco the invisible lost songwriter,"I first discovered this cd by Tom Pacheco in my favourite new/secondhand store in Glasgow 2002.I took a listen via headphones and could not believe what I was listening to. Here was a man I had never heard of before, sounding very much like Bob Dylan but more melodic, and the lyrics of his songs were absolutely outstanding and very relevant and clever in this day and age.I would recommend any newcomer to Tom's music to have a go at this album.Tom's cds are very hard to come by at a reasonable price due to availabilty etc. but I have managed over the last few months to pick up WoodstockWinter, Sunflowers&Scarecrows;, Barebones&Barbwire.;All of which are just as equally as good.I just cannot understand why Tom is not as well known in the USA as he is in the UK, Europe and Scandanavia. He is nearly the the lost invisible songwriter in America. No disrespect intended"
5,Can keep track of your child's progress!!,This book helps you keep track of what your child is doing and the pace. Most school send home progress reports every report card period--but with this book you will know EXACTLY what you child is doing & when. It's your own personal record & if your child isn't up to par on some things then those are the things that you can help them at home with. It goes from kindergarten to the eigth grade. It's fantastic if you ask me. I've learned from this exactly what every parent wants to know. We don't have to wait on the progress reports---we are now able to keep our own. Personal satisfaction!! ANOTHER DEFINITE MUST!!!!
5,Egyptian Paganism for Beginners,"I found this work to be very easy to understand. It holds a wealth of informationon the Egyptian religion, their gods and their rites and rituals. The authors have madethe information accessible to all who want to follow the pagan rites of the Egyptians.I found the work easy to understand and filled with sharp insight into the heart ofEgyptian paganism and magic. I recommend this book to anyone starting out on the Egyptian pathas well as any general student of the occult as this work makes an excellent addition to theoccult library."
4,Great Informative Work,In all this book was very well researched and written. The only complaint I have is that not many rituals were included.
3,Just Like Alton Brown,I basicly got this to crack up my mom. She likes good eats with Alton Brown and whenever he points to the chalkboard he doesn't use a pointer he uses this extendable fork. She liked it alot
2,Gag Fork Gift,"I got this as a gift for a friend because he thought it was funny. I was a little disappointed in the quality. Yes, it's a gag gift, but I would have preferred it to be more durable and usable as a real quality fork."
2,"Interesting, but... not what it seems.","This is NOT the Story Theater of the Broadway show created by Paul Sills, and the actors from the show who are listed here (e.g., Melinda Dillon) and in the imdb.com entry for this title do not appear in this DVD. This is a group of scenes performed at the Yale School of Drama that are ""inspired"" by Sills' work and based on folk tales that Sills used. Acting students may find it interesting, but fans of the Broadway play will be confused at best, and disappointed."
2,For the under 8 crowd,"As noted in the other customer review, this is not the Broadway production but a Yale drama school event. Having an interest in Paul Sill's Story Theater, I ordered the DVD anyway to see his approach. The production was a disappointment - by today's theatrical standards, stiff and often slow. Because of the amount of mime involved, I think there's value here as a teaching tool for very young drama students, possibly K-3rd grade. (Although you'd want to preview all the stories first - ""The Blue Light"" turns removing a pair of boots into an erotic act.) The stories are simple and the costumes bright enough to keep the attention of young children. As for older students or adult viewers, it's just not punchy enough."
5,Great stories by an American original,"These wonderful stories mine the whole of American life, but Powers was at his best when he wrote about the very narrow slice of life that confines, constricts and defines the lives of Catholic priests. The comedy inherent in parish and church politics, the worldliness of men who have supposedly dedicated their lives to God, the loneliness of other men who have discovered that God is absent from most of their daily routine---these are Powers' favorite subjects, and in exploring them he produced some of the saddest and funniest stories to be found outside of Joyce's ""Dubliners."""
1,Puffed Up Version,"Nothing wrong with this version of Powers' stories, but I prefer the original, unabridged ""Prince of Darkness and Other Stories"" which is available in Doubleday paperback, first published back when Powers was hailed as ""a compelling young talent in American fiction, perhaps the most exciting short-story writer to emerge since Eudora Welty."" -- Philadelphia Inquirer.The Doubleday Image Books imprint set about ""making the world's finest Catholic literature avilable to all..."" True, Mr. Powers' work is formed by his Catholicism, but in subject matter, he writes about baseball and jazz, old people and boys, boxers and more. He has, The New Yorker once observed,""few rivals at creating characters with more than superficial reality."""
4,Good product for family fun,"We bought this at around $66 from amazon, which seems a good deal to us. We did some online search and comparison. No too much reviews for this product.Pros-.Wireless range is good, even without base antenna, we have no problem to use it in our living room. attaching the antenna will extend its range to all rooms in our house..Signal quality is good. Not too much noise..Product feel is OK, better than those cheap alternatives..Each Mic has a volume control which can be used to adjust the input level.Cons-.Batteries we received are the worst Nicds we have ever had. One set (there are 2 sets, each set consists 3 batts.)could not even hold any charge. We had to substitute with our own batteries..The build-in charging station works, but the indicators are always in red colors, and never turn in green - indicating the charging process is complete. We have tried 2 daysbut they are still red."
4,DVD Audio - Surf Classics.,"A 96Khz 5.1 DVD Audio surround disc that also contains 5.1 tracks in DTS and Dolby Digital. Two types of still photos can be chosen as BGV (Back Ground Video) behind the music - one features photos of the artists and the other is general surfy type photos. This surfing omnibus has 10 tracks and as most of them are from the early sixties it tends to make the album seem very short. The newest track is the Beach Boys ""Sail on Sailor"" which is really nice in surround. Some of the earlier tracks sound to my ears to be a little enhanced, but definately 5.1 - a nice introduction to 1960's oldies in surround."
3,Surfs Up,If you like early Surf music you will have not heard it like this ever before. The 5.1ch sound gives the music new life and is an enjoyable listen. It is however too short and the photgraphy is disappointing in that any Beach Boys jan & Dean fan will have seen them before......well worth buying though for the sound .....enjoy!!
2,Inside the Music - Surf's Up (DVD Audio),Great music from that time period !! Would have been much better with videoinstead of still pictures ; or really cool colors that flow and vibrate withthe musical instruments and vocals ; in beautifull patterns !!
2,Softcore fiction from Tyler,"It was not so easy to say wether this book deserved a 2 or a 3 rating. The main reason to end up with 2 is based mainly on my personal taste.I expected the book to explore more of the D/s side of the life with the head mistresses at the Blue rose. Instead we follow the girls in very soft and tender (and well written) lesbian love fantasies which they share in a diary they keep hidden among themselves.If that kind of erotica is your turn-on, The Blue Rose could score high, but there are tons of lesbian litterature dealing with that theme, especially with a victorian boarding scool setting. For me, fancying concensual dominant/submissive lesbian relationships wihth a lot of sex and a little punishment, this was a disappointment, because that was what i expexted from the book description."
2,Underpowered with annoying switch,"I am stripping paint off concrete floors with aNorton Non-Woven Depressed Center Rapid Strip Discs, 4-1/2"" Diameter, 5/8""-11 Arbor Hub, Grit Coarse (Pack of 1). I bought a 13-ampDEWALT D28115 Heavy-Duty 4-1/2-Inch/5-Inch High Performance Grinder with Trigger Gripand it works great, but Dewalt doesn't make a dust guard and I couldn't get theBosch 18SG-5E 5-Inch Surface Grinding Guardto fit. This grinder was highly rated so I bought it.Unfortunately it bogs down constantly when I use it and is essentially worthless for any heavy duty grinding tasks. It might be great if you need a light-duty variable speed grinder but otherwise it's a waste of money; might as well just buy a cordless. Bosch doesn't seem to make any 5"" grinders over 10 amps.Also I found the switch to be inconveniently located and annoying to use."
3,Switch has broken,Our company has owned other models of this Bosch grinder (1706E) for use in our masonry construction company. This 1803EVS grinder worked for a month or more then the on-off switch began getting tight. Now it has broken inside the grinder. This problem has not occurred on past models so I assume it is just an accidental thing.The demise of past Bosch grinder models seemed to be that when we used them to grind out mortar joints with a wide or a sandwich blade it took too much horsepower for these machines and they quit.
1,Don't Buy It,"Shame on somebody for releasing this product. Let me be clear, I am a big Staple Singer fan. However the quality of this recording is horrible. It sounds like someone sat in the audience with a portable tape recorder & somehow the recording ended up on CD. One track actually has crackle in the backround where it was obviously recorded from an LP. I have to wonder if the group approved this release. The label is called Collectable, but this disc is more like a throw-away. I can't believe the label had the nerve to include an offer for their catalog of other releases. I am disappointed to end up with such a product..."
4,Very Good,"I think alot of these people overrate Pedro. Now, I love this cd and I think PTL is a great band, but listen to the music. It's not difficult at all. The chords are simple, the lead parts are easy, and the drumming is some of the most easy beats I have ever heard. The lyrics are good but not that impressive. This cd is one of my favorites, but it is very simple and it is not complex music. It's not groundbreaking in any way. Get it if you are a fan of simple emo, it is a very good album."
5,Please listen to these guys.,This is some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard. David Bazan is a genius for pulling it off. A perfectly great album from truly wonderful people.
5,the most underrated band in christian music today,"judging from their reception at cornerstone 99, pedro is not the unknown band they once were. the show was packed out and their new ep sold out once again - just like last year at the same fest, the same tent...trying to get my hands on the ep was really hard to do! i searched from july of 98 till march of this year for this lp. and it was worth the search!their style is minimalist, but their lyrics are so right on! songs like ""big trucks"" and ""when they really get to know you they will run"" go beyond the normal christian music fare.they're not getting radio play, but they don't need it. they have a following all over this country...and news spreads by word of mouth.another plus is, is if you write to them, they'll send you something back! (try and find out....) they aren't rock stars....they're pedro. and that's just darned irresistable..."
2,Doesn't fit,"As nice as it looks, it doesn't fit properly on my PSP. It doesn't close well near the top...and some of the buttons, including the top two, get jammed in the frame when pressed. The PSP I have is listed as a model that can use the faceplate, but doesn't work for me. I eventually gave it away since it was of no use to me."
2,good looking,I liked how it looked but like the others mentioned it did not fit! I struggled and spent a time ot to make it fit but it was useless so I just decided to discard the product.
2,Not Much Good for Me....,"I admit I didn't have high hopes for this CD. I've had a nasty chronic insomnia for the past several years that has stumped an impressive array of doctors. It would be a mistake to really describe Dr. Thompson's Ambient Music for Sleep as music in the sense that most people think of it, and for some it might be just the thing to send them over the edge into slumber. But with me, it produced only slight drousiness."
1,Didn't work at all,"Tried the CD twice, and neither time did it help either my husband or me fall asleep. The music was rather annoying, and when we did finally fall asleep (after 45 minutes of the music or so) we both slept terribly. Very dissapointing."
2,sleep sounds,"I was rather disappointed when I received my Ambient Music for Sleep. I believe its due to my not listening closely to the sample album. I only wanted nature sounds, ( crickets, water, wind, etc) however there is music in the background and that's not what I want. I'm not sure if they specifically sell, what I desire or not.Annette Hill"
3,Pros and Cons of this CD,"I purchased this CD along with the others in the series...Classical, Natural and Soothing. I am not sure if there was a flaw in production or what the deal is. I have a CD alarm clock next to the bed that I listen to the CDs on. For the other three the ""right"" volume is 4. To even hear this one I have to turn it 7 or 8. I am not sure why there is such a big difference.But once I get it to where I can actually hear it, I do like the CD and it does help me fall asleep. I like it a whole lot better then the ""Soothing"" which annoys me to pieces.Would be great if it was recorded at a decent volume."
1,Not what I expected,"It's a big stretch to call this music. A more descriptive title would be Ambient Sounds. It's more like variable white noise, or a low, almost inaudible base monotone with hissing. It may work if you want background sounds all night, but I prefer to listen, relax, and then turn it off when I'm sleepy.I bought Peaceful Music for Sleep for our daughter's naps. It's also by Jeffrey Thompson, and it is music-like a gentle flute and piano duet. It certainly seems to help our daughter sleep, and puts me in a restful and peaceful mood too.I expected Ambient Music to be similar, so I was very disappointed. I can't listen to this CD long enough to find out if it works. I suggest you listen to the sample if you can. (I didn't.) On my computer it sounds like very quiet, almost inaudible hissing. That's what this CD is like. Obviously it works for some, but if you want relaxing music, try Peaceful Music for Sleep instead."
5,magical project s,great anime! nothing but the best from the cutest girl from the tenchi muyo series.
4,Japanese only with english subtitles!,"Great show just wish it was in english, this is japanese only with english subtitles. :("
2,PRETTY SAMMY MAGICAL PROJECT S,"This anime is pratically base on the tenchi episode. Most ofthe character are from tenchi. I recommend you to get it even if its in japanese laguage. its really worth it. the extra on the dvd is really funny. It has 2 disc.sammy is a funny show, bet you'll love it if you give it a try. this dvd only cotain the frist 13 episode,total is 26 episode. the last 13 episode is in the pixy final. My favoirte character was the evil magical girl pixy misa, she's really funny.it just makes you laugh every time you watch her battle against sammy."
5,A wonderful collection,"This is a wonderful collection of essays and chapters from Mr. Podhoretz. Mr. Podhoretz is one of the great dissidents of the right whose stance against his `former friends' of the left has earned him a grand reputation and much critique. In this new reader you will find such wonderfully insightful essays as `My Negro Problem-and ours' as well as his views of Hannah Arendt and Eichman where he skewers her opinion that the Jews should have fought harder in WWII by showing that in fact Germany lost the war in order to `finish' the Holocaust. Here you will find the great essays and open letters where Podhoretz declares himself out to his former friends of the left and where he takes on such luminaries as Mr. Ginsberg. A fabulous collection that will be a great addition to any shelf that contains Bloom, Rand, Strauss or Horowitz."
3,Obscurantism,"I've never heard of this guy nor read his works, but in certain circles he is revered, perhaps because he switched sides.At best obscurantism; at worse literary criticism of the kind that engineers loath--that's why engineers hate the humanities.But again, I've not read Podhoretz."
3,3 stars only because its Tim Finn,"The other reviewers seem to be fanatical Tim Finners. If you've heard the melodic music and great arrangements of some of his earlier work, then you'll notice this just doesn't compare. A slightly more listenable record than Say It Is So, but just slightly. After listening to it several times, there's just nothing that sticks in your head like ""Many's the Time"", ""Can't Do Both"", or so many of his earlier songs. Still gets 3 stars because an average Tim Finn is better than a lot of others."
5,One of the best new shows.,"Good Characters, Great Stories in a Great City. Good writing and lots of fun. 5 stars easily. To me i cant see how anyone would give it less than 4."
5,"ACTION, SUSPENCE, AND EDGE OF YOUR SEAT VIEWING!","The pilot was very good. Things moved fast, not much time to get bored. There is alot of anticipation as to what will happen next, and what does happen is generally unexpected. This new series is quite a roller coaster ride and promises to be a first rate program. Takes place in Chicago, present day. A woman doctor's brother is in trouble with the local mob. The Dr. agrees to help the mob out by patching up Goodfellas, if they leave her brother alone. The brother is a bit of a looser, so we can expect alot more trouble in future episodes. However, things tend to get out of hand for the good doctor, both with the mob and with everyday situations at the hospital. Good stuff, well worth your time to check it out."
5,I love this show!!!,"Matching medical drama with mob drama is hard to do, but this show does it well. A very interesting combination. I hope it continues!!!"
4,Mob Doctor,"Love the mixture of organized crime and medicine! The only thing that bothers me just a little is when Grace performs surgery outside of the hospital scene, such as when she did a caesarian in a bedroom apartment."
3,Good,"I really wanted to like this series better. Don't get me wrong, it is good and an enjoyable hour of entertainment, but it's not great."
2,Medicore Mob Doctor,A doctor torn between professional ethics and an obligation to the mob should stop practicing medicine. The pilot was interesting but the premise will just produce a series of conflicts of the week.
2,Boring,The concept of the show...that the doctor has to compromise her principles by doing jobs for the mob to protect her brother just didn't work. I can't imagine week after week is not my cup of tea.
5,Interesting take on a formula medical series,I liked the action and the acting was very good for a relatively unknown group of people. I think the way she handles her moral dilemmas showed some thought on the part of the writers. I am hoping for a second season.
5,Lots of history to sort out,"I was happy with this pilot. Clearly, the doctor has a lot of history with the mob to sort out, all the way back to her dad.If it's handled well, this could make for a very interesting season. I look forward to finding out.The pace of the pilot was a little frantic, but there's always so much to cram into the first hour of a show, so it's to be expected."
5,Great Show,"The Mob Doctor is like a Shakespearean play, Grace haunted by the past of her father etc. Terrific actors, by the second episode, you are hooked."
1,Didn't work,I didn't pay attention with the programs it works with. I do hv vista and it didn't work wit it.
2,Watch age limit,"I bought this for my four year old. Even I can't get past the monkeys throwing berries. Rugrats are for younger kids, but this game is not."
1,No response from company,"After ordering product, company never responded. Amazon did however let me know that they were not getting a response from the company either. I never received product, nor was I charged for the product."
4,great little dock,"this is a very good, inexpensive, docking station. i've been using it for over a year now and it has been great. the only problem i have discovered is that after a power outage, it gets hung and requires being unplugged and plugged back in. this is a very small quirk that i rarely have to deal with.unlike many of the USB docking stations out there which are little more than USB hubs, in addition to 2 USB ports, this dock has PS2 mouse and keyboard ports as well as serial and parallel connectors.i have a wide variety of gear that i use including a KVM switch and this device supports them all while allowing me to dock and un-dock my laptop via a single USB jack."
4,Rock is dead,"The Guns, God, and Government World Tour DVD highlights Marilyn Manson's tour around the world by piecing footage together for the 17 song set and also includes a rowdy and downright hilarious half hour documentary. The live set nicely displays how great the stage shows are at a Manson concert; and the crowds respond with unabashed worship towards Manson and crew. Standout songs include ""Irresponsible Hate Anthem"", ""Great Big White World"", ""The Nobodies"", ""Rock is Dead"", ""Cruci-fiction in Space"", ""Sweet Dreams"", and ""Lunchbox"". The aforementioned documentary is a nice bonus, but for the price of this DVD, some other features could have been included, but all together this DVD is better than I thought it would be."
3,What is the real horror about Manson on stage!?,"The best part of having a Manson Cd is you don't have to watch him. Unfornatly a DVD you do. I like some of his songs and have all of his CDs but the only thing about havings this DVD and seeing him do the songs I like is I have to look at him play with himself and do obscene things on stage with his band members,equipment and anything else with matter in it. The costumes and makeup wouldnt be so bad if he didnt act like some drugged ape that just escaped lock up. You may call it rock theatre which it is but I've seen others do shows that werent like this. Even Alice Cooper was better on stage. Good for some of the music but watching his perversions and wooden doll antics is the reason I dont like this DVD."
4,"Great performance, too many shows","41/2 stars for this dvd Manson always puts out the best shows, you can hate him or love him but you'll have a great time. This dvd looks and sounds great the only problem is that you have shots from more than one show ans sometimes it gets a little confusing."
3,Portrait of Controversy,"I can honestly say that I am not a big fan of Marilyn Manson's music but I do support his First Amendment right to speak as he pleases. With the said the Guns, God and Government World Tour of 1999-2001 was one of the controversial artists defining moments.The video was filmed all over the world so that we never get an actual show but a collage of several shows from all over the tour. I'm not a big fan of concert films that are put together this way but everyone can make their own decision on the merits of this approach.The film features 17 of Manson's songs including powerful versions of such classics as Disposable Teens, Beautiful People, The Dope Show, Sweet Dreams and Lunchbox. The band with the addition of new guitarist John 5 plays the music quite well.The disc features the concert and a 30 minute behind the scenes feature called THe Death Parade."
5,MANSON TRULY IS ABOVE AND BEYOND!,"THIS DVD IS EXCELLENT!MANSON'S THE #1 PERFORMER,AND HIS CONCERTS ARE #1!HE MOVES AROUND THE WHOLE STAGE BEAUTIFULLY!HE'S SO HYPNOTIC!THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM!HE HAD FIRE,AND SMOKE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CONCERT.AT CERTAIN TIMES THERE WERE DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHTS.HE WAS CONSTANTLY DOING DIFFERENT THINGS,AND CHANGING CLOTHES.HE WALKED ON HIS HIGH STILTS.HE STOOD ON A HIGH PLATFORM-MUCH HIGHER THAN HIS STILTS.HE'S TRULY A PHENOMINAL MAN!THERE'S A SECTION IN THIS DVD CALLED:""THE DEATH PARADE"".IT'S ALSO EXCELLENT!IT SHOWS DIFFERENT CLIPPINGS OF CONCERTS,WHAT GOES ON BEFORE AND AFTER THE CONCERTS,WHERE THE CONCERTS ARE,THERE'S PLENTY OF CLIPPINGS WITH MANSON TALKING AND DOING DIFFERENT THINGS.HE'S A TRIP!MANSON AND HIS BAND WAS ALSO PARTYING WITH THE FANS BACKSTAGE.HE'S SO SPECIAL!HE TRULY IS MAJESTIC,IMPERIAL,EXTRAODINARY,REMARKABLE,AMAZING,ETC...YOU NEED TO GET THIS DVD!"
2,Dissapointed......,"I just recieved the VHS Video version of this Concert of Marilyn Manson, and I must say I am very dissapointed. I don;t have a DVD player, so I needed to get the VHS version of this show, and none of the extras was in the video. The Death Parade Documentary was not included, no behind the scenes stuff, backstage footage, nothing! Just a concert. The concert was good though- typical Marilyn Manson show, so that was GOOD, but what happened to all the behind the scenes stuff? Why was not The Death Parade documentary not included on the VHS version?Get ""God is in the TV"" or ""Dead to The world"" better."
5,Sonds Great!,"I couldn't listen to Manson at all before watching this; I thought his music was crap, but this DVD changed my mind completely. A lot of the songs are from Holy Wood, one of my favorites, and the others sound 1000x better than their studio versions. I get the impression it might have undergone a lot of engineering to get the quality of sound it has, but who cares, put on the headphones and crank it up!!"
1,The Music Sucks,"Marilyn Manson have not been good since they got rid of Daisy Berkowitz on guitar. Listen to Portrait of an American Family, that album is 10 times better than anything they have put out since. That was also during the time they were somewhat normal, their looking feminine era hadn't started yet. I have seen that happen with so many bands, where their first album is way better than anything they ever put out again (ie. Korn, Deftones, Rage Against The Machine). These bands need to stop getting away from what made them explode onto the scene. It's almost like they try to get too creative on their next albums."
5,Leupold 2 pc matte Base,I received my Leupold base for my new scope. They arrive in excellent shape and as always an excellent product by Leupold.
1,Great....when working,"This router has been nothing but frustration; I bought it because I thought the idea of two computers sharing a printer through one router was a great idea; and it is....a great idea that is. I have to reboot the router at least once a week, frequently not having access to the internet and/or printer. Frequently I get LAN errors; when I bypass the router everything works great. The reset button doesn't do anything that I am aware of; I mistakenly threw out the box so I think I am stuck with it.When this router is working, everything is great; but when it isn't you can count on spending at least an hour getting everything set up again.I am very disappointed; this is my first router/print server combo and I had high hopes of smooth sailing."
2,No Firewall Administration Options as showed in DLink Page,"I recently purchase this item, I found that there is no Firewall Administration Options in the menu as showed in the DLink Product Page Manual (Everything else is good). I'm talking with the Dlink support and have no solution. DLink support team says ""There are no firewall options on this router. To open ports on these routers you will use vserver and applications.

4,Seung-beom Ryu turns a comedy/drama/martial arts film from good to great in the lead,"Nerdy rookie policeman Sang-hwan, in pursuing a purse-snatcher who drives a motorcycle, ends up badly hurt. He's taken by the woman martial artist, who has caught the purse-snatcher, to be revived and healed by the Five Masters ... who recognizes, in Sang-hwan, the most powerful of chi - the makings of a genuine warrior. As they groom Sang-hwan (still a nerd) to become a legend, an outcast Master returns to modern-day Seoul to - among other things - enact his revenge on the Five Masters who used to be his comrades. Funny, exciting, and with great fight scenes (especially at the end), the film works largely due to the great performance of Seung-beom Ryu as Sang-hwan."
4,Comic-Action Special Effects Extravaganza,I deducted a star for the drawn-out climax. Fans of Steven Chow are in for a treat. Korean movies always provide peerless acting with humor and subtlety of plot. The basic storyline falls under the Novice to Master category. The English translation is solid (I do not speak Korean). Best viewed with Korean dialogue subtitled.
5,Classic Slow Jams...,"This double disc set compiled by Philly radio station WDAS FM (105.3), once again shows that a great music can be at your fingertips in a matter of seconds! This set contains so many classic slow jams! You can put this on and just chill out and reminisce! Travel back to a time when music was music...love was love and making love started in the mind...and not on the dance floor or on a stage!On this particular set, you've got the classic, rare cut ""Forever More"" by Enchantment (which isn't even found on their best of CD). You also have the Michael Henderson, Norman Connors collaboration on ""You are my Starship."" The once very popular ""Magic Man"" by Robert Winters & Fall! Yes, it keeps going...and going..with Ms. Phyllis Hyman's ""Meet Me on the Moon."" I really could go on forever...but I will end it with this: If you can, purchase all of WDAS's compilations...they really do a heck of a job picking songs from the past and synchronizing them on disc."
2,Poor watchband quality,"I have no idea what material the band is made out of, but it definitely is not very durable. Within the first week of wear, the band was tearing."
2,Bizarre,"What a bizarre book. I checked it out from the library expecting beautiful photographs of stunning gardens and equally lovely descriptions. Not here! Instead, there are lush photographs and bizarre psychobabble. Of course, I am a scientist, and have a hard time dealing with this type of nonsense at the best of times.Don't waste either your time or money. The photographs are beautiful, but the the written portion seems to consist solely of Ms. Woods's silly spiritual ramblings."
4,Good Work from the Berkeley Theatre Archive,"The action of this play takes place in a single room (and a single act), and this version makes no attempt to change this, so don't watch it if you're looking for filmic frills. That said, the set is well-done and the performances are very good, good enough, in fact, that it's hard to point out any particular standouts. (Star Trek fans will note the appearances of Rene Auberjonois and a very young-looking Andrew Robinson, billed as Andy Robinson, as Leduc the actor and the (German) Major.)The BTA series was originally done for television, so the image quality is not great, but both picture and sound seem to be as good as ""new.""Like all the Kultur DVDs of the Broadway Theatre Archive I've seen, this version has no extras to speak of. Aside from the program itself, there is a short of previews of other titles and a scene selection option."
4,Good resource...,"For RPGers or just Trek Fans this is a very good guide on several of the planets/systems mentioned in Star Trek. Gives a brief bit of history on each, as well as info. on the system (# of planets, star type, etc...). Planets include: Acamar, Aldea, Alpha Centauri, Andor, Ba'ku, Betazed, Bolius, Calder, Caldos, Cestus, Denocet, Dytallix, Earth, Galor, Lyaar, Minos, Nausicaa, Oyarsa, Qualor, Risa, Tellar, Vagra and Vulcan."
5,Great Tool,"I am not a contractor, but I always seem to have some type of project going on that requires a large variety of tools. In the past whenever I needed to drill thru concrete I would use a heavy duty drill and have to sharpen the bits quite often. Then I got a 18 Volt Dewalt Drill w/ hammer function and this worked great, however if the hole was very big or there were several holes to drill, this would require extra batteries and the need to sharpen the bits often, but it always got the job done. Then one day a neighbor let me borrow his Bosch SDS Rotary Hammer and I drilled 10 holes in same time it used to take me to drill one. The next day I purchased my own and have used it several times. What a Great Tool to add to my collection."
3,under powered,"I have been using this drill to install porch railings. It works nice but when I put some force behind it it tries to bog down, I dont mean a lot of force and that is with a new 1/4 inch bosch concrete bit. It makes me wonder what it will do with a larger bit.....go easy I guess. Other then being a little short on power its a really nice drill. The rotory hammer is not near as noisey as other drills i've used, that I like."
3,Disappointed that kit wasn't complete for my use.,"When I received my Bosch 11224VSR 7/8 inch SDS-plus bulldog rotary hammer I was disappointed a 3 jaw chuck wasn't includedin the kit. The extra cost to purchase the additional part needed would have made other similiar/ equal products amore cost effective buy & more versatile. After reveiwing your online presentation which I apparently misunderstood please be very clear to future purchasersof these type of items that some essential parts are considerd accessories,but are necessary. Future buyers beware.Steve"
3,Not So Nice,"I purchased over $2,500.00 in tools for my Construction Co. a couple of months ago and of all the tools I purchased this one disappointed most. i guess i should have known that a drill with a 6.9 amp motor should have dedicated use, not try to be a ""jack of all trades"". The latter half of the saying applied to this drill--- Master of None! Too little power and the drill can't handle any kind of low RPM high friction/ torque work. It starts to smoke. I love Bosch and MOST of their products, this one is trying to wear too many hats for me--- 3 Stars."
3,Stucco and more,"Bought this at the local Big Orange Retail Giant, cuz I needed it tonight. It chews up 35 yr old stucco very nicely, and much faster than a bricklayers hammer. Putting in new windows and eventually going to cut a weep screed opening across a 75 ft expanse so I wanted a tool that was fast enough and yet not too heavy for use on a ladder."
1,Worked great until it failed,"I bought this tool to remove tile in my shower. For a couple hours, it worked fantastic on the hammer function. But then it just stopped hammering. The chisel would vibrate mildly, but not enough to do any good. After moving it around at different angles and letting it run, it would occasionally start hammering again, but not for long, and it's back in the mild vibration mode. It's totally useless for the hammer function now (which was what I bought it for), and I've gotten only about two hours worth of use out of it. I'll return it tomorrow, and I'll probably upgrade to the next model up in hopes that it lasts a bit longer."
2,A big let down...,"I played this game for pc when it fist came out and I was amazed by it. The game had crisp lines, great AI, and fast loading times. I was so stoked when I heard it was coming out for the PS3, and boy was I disappointed. The graphics of this game are no where near up to scratch with a next gen $600 dollar gaming system. And the load times were absolutely appalling, taking up to a minute and a half to load. Lots of times I thought the game had frozen. The monotony of the levels was a annoyance that was carried over from the original game. On a lighter note, I really think it would suck to work for Armacham Technologies. I mean, wouldn't you get lost all the freaking time?? I guess a saving feature is the advanced AI is still there, but otherwise, F.E.A.R. for PS3 was a big let down."
4,Great Game!,"The game was scary and awesome graphics, But the online play is really lacking when compared to RFOM. Overall Excellent buy!!"
2,Not as per PS3 Standard,I had very hopes from this game as I really liked the XBOX version but It is not so good for PS3. The graphics and gameplay shall be improved a bit.
3,"Not the best, but fun.","Im starting to get aggravated with all this money Im wasting on games that are supposed to be good. But Fear is addicting.! The frame rate makes it hard to play when its crowded. We need a good one! Resistance, now thats a game!"
1,F.E.A.R. is not a factor in this game...,"What a let down.This game was suggested to me for someone into survival horror. This is anything but.A few creepy cut scenes does not a survival horror make. In fact, you can't even equate this with a good first person shooter. The controls are a mess. A zoom-in on the right control stick? Good luck aiming! At least make the controls mappable...And the atmosphere: Ouch. Every single building/ warehouse/ parking lot looks the same! After you've run all over for 30 minutes trying to find the one spot you haven't found that happens to be the way out, you hear the enemy has spotted you.Bottom line: Exhausting, boring, and a waste of time. The same goes with the 3rd in the series."
1,"Lame really, so many better games out there","As far as 1st person shooter games, this game is lame. Go with great ones like Rainbow six or Call of Duty. Thats where its at. This game is hurtin."
4,F.E.A.R......slightly overrated,"FEAR is one of the most coveted of the PS3 of the FPS genre why? I have no idea.It's basically a high action-packed shooter that has some supernatural moments.The scenes of the character Alma do add a degree of mystery to the game along with some ghostly elements thrown in.There's nothing about the game I could say that jumps out and scares the hell out of you,more along the lines of 'what was that'?The amount of weapons you get in the game is plentiful and the Matrix-like Slow Motion effect is a very nice touch.As for the graphics I have no complaints whatsoever,and I would highly recommend it for any first person shooter fan.Minus 1 star for the lack of depth to the game overall-more ideas could have been put into the first FEAR."
4,Not so bad...actually very entertaining.,"I bought the PC version a year or so ago. Started to play this scary game and then a few days later my computer crashed (for other reasons). I gave away my copy to my brother, since I no longer had a PC. Next I bought a copy for the PS3. Indeed the graphics do appear crappy compared to other versions. I quickly forgot about this because the gameplay is quite unique and captivating. Definitely a scary game with a fun story. The slowMo feature is a lot of fun too, you end up using it to get out of tight situations and makes you feel like someone from the Matrix (bullet time)."
3,F.E.A.R. not really next-gen but fun to play.,I have to agree with the general concensus. The graphics overall are 'eh' ok. I thought the graphics did get better further on in the game and they are enhanced when in 'focus or slomo' mode. It's not what I hoped it would be but once you master the techniques it is very fun to play. I would recommend renting it first but give it a chance. I'd say 3-5 hours of gameplay should tell you if it is a game for you. I've beaten it once and am playing through a second time on a harder setting. The story is interesting and there are a few creepy spots in the game. Play it in the dark late at night.:)
3,"Good game, could've been better..","Pros:Spooky and scaryStory Line is good.Cons:Framerate is horribleLoad time is horriblemaps could've been detailed and they could've used more imagination.Online play is boring, nothing creative.I probably wont be playing this game after i finish it. Though it is a good game, i was somewhat disappointed. I'm having fun playing it... but i dont think the fun factor is going to last long. i'd love to lie to everyone about my rating because i'm a diehard PS3 fan... but you might just want to rent this game 1st."
3,was good...,This was such a great game when it first came out. So I tried to replay it now and was just disappointed. The controls sucked and the graphics were horrible.
3,good game just bad ps3 port,"The game is really good if you play it on PC. Guys who did the port to PS3 didn't do a very good job. The gameplay is still good, just not as good as on PC. If you really want to enjoy this game you should pick it up on PC. It will offer you a much better experience."
3,Great but graphics very sketchy,This game has fun with shooting and stuff. It is very freaky and makes u jump. Graphics sucked. You'd think that since it was blu-ray the graphics would be good.
3,FEAR,OVERALL THE GAME LACKS GRAPHICS AND SOUND WHEN THERE'S A SPEECH INVOLVE BUT IT HAS GREAT SOUND OF THE WEAPONS YOU GET TO USE. IT POSSES A GOOD GAME PLAY AND SOMETHING TO HAVE IN MIND IS THAT THIS GAME WAS LAUNCH FIRST FOR PC AND THEN WAS RELEASE FOR PS3 SO I HAVE BEEN TOLD. NEVER THE LEES IS A GOOD FPS BUT IT LACKS GRAPHICS.
1,NOT WORTH RENTING !!,"The controls are so bad I thought I was on a pogo stick in the middle of an ice rink. I can't believe this game is on PS3, this game would be bad on PS1. And you have this constant cloping sound of your feet when you move and you bounce up and down very annoying. Seirra owes everyone who has bought or rented this game compensation for pain and suffering. And R2 is the fire trigger I hate that."
2,Not as good as the review lead you to believe.,I bought the game thinking that it was great like the reviews always have been spreading to people. But when i bought the game I could not help but feel really bored by this game. I hope some people had more fun with this to me this game felt repetative and the controls were very clunky. And I don't know about the PC version but the graphics for the PS3 did not feel so next-gen to me.
4,Great but no attachments!,"This is one fine tool, but what are those people at Bosch thinking. For the amount you pay, they could at least throw in a few attachments. I bought this because I wanted the versatility of Temperature control. It would be even more versatile with the attachments which seem to be hard to find."
5,Used this textbook in my NYU Master's Degree program,"I had the priviledge of taking Perry Drake's class when I was getting my Master's Degree in Direct and Interactive Marketing at New York University. The class was taught by Perry Drake himself, who is still teaching at NYU.If you want to know statistics and how to manage databases and select lists for mailings from those databases, this is THE book. It is not a light read, and you'll need to have a solid understanding of statistics to grasp what's being done here. All that said, this is a really meaty book that will teach you what the pros know. Actually, to be honest, VERY few of the pros even know this stuff. That's based on a decade's worth of experience consulting for small direct marketing companies after I got my degree.If you have a list, and a database, either you or somebody in your company should know what's in this book. Otherwise you may well be missing out on, oh, 10-20+% in potential sales. How's that for motivation?"
5,Present,My dad asked me what colognes he thought he should by for a couple of mentors in his life. He wanted something that was a good price and quality. I bought two for the excellent price and because I have a bottle of my own. Versace did their thing with this cologne.
5,Good item - worth the money -,I bought these spring perches for a project I'm building - the explanation of this item had me to understand that the price of these were 'per piece' but the price is 'per pair' - so I bought 2 pair instead of 2 parts - and the price was still good at that - I'll keep the extra pair - heavy duty and recommended -
4,"Simply put, a novel","I read this novel a few years ago - and decided to reread it.A well written novel about so much more than suspense and criminals. Lee writes about neighborhoods that change, life suspended by memories, mistakes, and decisions, internal struggle, the relationships we create, and survival.The characters are crafted superbly. More than anything, I truly enjoyed following the psychology of Martin Quinn.Some beautifully written passages.Read it."
5,I heard this in a vintage store in Hollywood...,"And the clerk at the checkout counter said, they were playing a Bellfuries cd. So I jotted it down, and here I found it on Amazon. This cd is exellent, and is on the same high musical level as Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys or Cave Cat Sammy. This small group plays primarliy western swing with a more rockabilyl edge. There are hints of jazz and western roots, and the vocals are exellent with a slight echoe. A marvelous cd, and a tight band, great steel guitar solos too.A perfect rockabilly revival bands perfect cd, new fresh energetic and exciting music that sounds vintage as if it were recorded in 1954!"
3,"Nikki Giovanni is phenomenal, but selections are not properly identified.","I was so happy to find this available on Amazon. I used to listen to my brother's album way back then. I was surprised to know how much I could still recite by heart. However, that was also a problem, not with the item, but with Amazon's product system. Most of the selections are not correctly identified, and one selection is not on this album at all (i.e. Butterflies\Hands). Hopefully this can be corrected."
3,beautiful but...,"These are beautiful shoes and look great with any clothes, but the way they are kept on is odd. Since these are laceless, the sides are sewn into the tongue. One one of my shoes, it was sewn a bit too tightly, so i had to cut some of the threads to make it so I could get my foot in! Also, the other reviewer is right in that these shoes run small. Get at least a half size if not a full size larger than what you usually wear. For the sale price they are currently at, these shoes are worth it, but at full price--definately not."
2,too small,"These shoes are so cute, but run very small. I would suggest you get it at least a size larger than your average size. I bought an 8 1/2, but I could barely get my foot in it. It was more like a size 7."
5,A Great Beat!,"The song ""Fiesta"" is a really good song. The beat will make you want to dance to it all night. I don't think that R. Kelly could have written this song any better!"
3,Wondering,"I like this song a lot i especially like the Jay-Z remix, the beat is alright but i herd it before but i can't put my finger on it"
1,Basura,"The song is basura....garbage. The only thing Latin about it is the title. As with most of R. Kelly's work, after the first 20 seconds you have heard the entire song, the rest is just an endless repeat. 'Fiesta' is no exception."
2,This bizarre performance is uncomfortable to watch...,"Jamie Oliver is unquestionably creative, and he certainly knows how to cook. But this strange live performance DVD is almost groaningly uncomfortable to watch at times, and makes you wonder what Oliver was thinking when he entered the world of live theater performance.From the bizarre introductory skit (Jamie orders pizza for the audience--ho, ho, that's a new one), to the unfunny interactions with his adoring fans, there's something strange and unpleasant about all this. One gets the feeling nobody had any idea what to do with this otherwise interesting idea--taking Jamie Oliver's immensely popular TV show and adapting it to live performance. The extraneous trappings just seem forced rather than fun. I bought this DVD to be entertained, but I had to actually stop in midstream simply because I found it hard to watch. That's too bad, because this could have been a lot of fun."
1,Don't bother,This item is so short you would have to bend over and practically stand on your head to use it. The seat was horribly difficult to get down and I wouldn't trust it to set on....very unstable. I would NOT advise anyone to purchase this item.
1,"""Hoo-rah"" of Hubris","From the onset the reader is given subtle clues as to where this ""yellow brick road"" is heading. From attributing a ""Theology of Cultural Pluralism"" to the genius of Lesslie Newbigin(a phrase never mentioned or documented by himself), to the conspicious abstraction of the word ""church"" - referenced only as a nebulous concept with never a concrete embodiment or example, Hunsberger perhaps confuses his own cultural disembededness and concomitant plausability crisis for an innovative analysis of Newbigins so-called ""pluralist"" missiology. If rallying around studied ambiguity,self contradiction, and inadvertant- if not ideologically deliberate - misinformation and distortion are your goals, this is the one. If not, I might suggest an old Temple and Mosque"". At least you will know where he's going and even if you think he gets it ""wrong"" you will know that you have been put on the""right"" track."
5,Completely Satisfied,This product was purchased for my mother whose sight and mobility are limited. The overbed table enables her to use a TV at a height and distance at which she can view and enjoy her programs from her recliner. The table was easy to assemble and is easy for her to roll to any position she wants. I highly recommend the Carex Overbed Table.
3,Carex Overbed Table,"This is a well designed product, the ""U"" shape table base with foot rest is perfected for wheelchair users if it have lockable casters. The table top should have more colors for users to pick."
4,very nice company,Very nice weight for moving about; small problem with broken corner of table but immediately made right by company; would deal with them again with no hesitation
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"This product is definately not sturdy enough to support the 50 lbs it is rated for. I anticipated something of more substantial construction, not a hollow table on a hollow leg. The base is listed at 33"". This measurement is taken from the outside, not the inside of the base meaning most modern, motorized wheelchairs won't fit beneath the table. This is considered medical equipment, so it cannot be returned."
4,good design,"The table has remained solid in use for the past 3 weeks. A larger caster might ease rolling on carpet although the under-bed clearance is tight as it is. Putting a cup depression on the other end as well might be useful. Including one of those washable non-skid perforated rubber mats might also be useful. Setup was easy with basic tools. Overall, this table is sturdy and versatile with a surface large enough for many purposes and an easy height adjustment for about $100 dollars."
4,Carex Overbed Table,"This table is a nice size & very sturdy for over the bed uses. It is also is easily adjustable to different heights & has small indentations for a cup and things like pecils, etc., to keep them from rolling off. It was very useful beside my bed after surgery. However, it must be disassembled for storage. I was disappointed that it did not just fold down & did not come apart easily to store."
1,No wheels in box,"I received the box with the overbed table in it the day before Christmas from Amazon for an ill family member. I purchased it as a Christmas gift. To my surprise when I opened the box there were no wheels. Everything else looked okay, and I even saw where the four wheels screwed into the bottom of the table so it could be moved, but my box had no wheels, which meant I could not give it as the Christmas gift as I had planned. I had to send it back to Amazon, and find another gift. I cannot say I blame Amazon for this because they sent it to my house without opening up the box. I blame Carex for this. The box should have had wheels in it, and even when I tried to call Carex they were taking four days off for the holidays. You may buy this table but be forewarned it may not have wheels in the box because of some worker's neglect."
4,Terrific product,This is a great product. It was purchased as a gift for mom who uses a motorized wheelchair. It fit perfectly over her chair. It was easy to assemble and we found it very sturdy!
4,And it fits my hand!,"I really like the ""fat"" pestle - it's much more comfortable to use than the more traditional shape. The only caveat is to be careful and don't drop it on a tile floor. The good news is that when ""someone"" in my house did so and shattered the (hollow ceramic) pestle, I got a replacement with a different (wider, shallower) mortar. I now have more flexibility than ever depending on what I'm crushing/grinding."
2,Better for younger children,"Based on the excellent reviews, I bought this video for my 8 yr. old daughter. Yes, we did it together and felt very silly.This video is geared to the preschool set. I thought that the poses were not held long enough, especially for kids who have had some prior yoga instruction. This video is a great introduction for younger children (under 7) but not for school age kids."
5,Luv it-Must have,"This is a great video for all: Parents and teachers. Kids of all ages luv it. Humourous, interesting and informative!! Highly recommended. A must have!"
5,Kids will love it--through 2nd grade,"My kids began doing yoga in PE class at school this past year--about the same time I began doing yoga. Many yoga DVDs are just above kid level (ability and interest-wise) unless the child has been doing yoga for awhile. I can see kids loving this--the breaks are humorous and allow kids a breather. It's a fun way to get children to exercise and to learn yoga poses. Of course they will move past this level in time, but it's a nice way to maintain their interest. I can see kids up through 2nd grade (and even into 3rd) enjoying this video. I also recommend Yoga Fitness for Kids ages 7-12 with Leah Kalish for elementary school age students--it's for kids but more serious while being fun, and seeing children their age (and older) doing the poses (and struggling with them, sometimes, too!) helps their self-esteem."
5,So much fun - for both of us!,"My daughter actually wakes me up in the morning, asking to do yoga. This video makes it so much fun for her, and it's a perfect beginners workout for me. All of the poses are done in a way that kids can make believe, and get some excercise at the same time. My five-year-old's favorite is ""the butterfly"", she pretends she's flying around looking for flowers. This is great for someone like me because I have no motivation to work out whatsoever, but my daughter encourages it. This is the first workout video I've ever seen that actually makes it fun for kids and adults alike."
4,perfect for starting out...,"i just bought this tape two days ago and my 2 year old loves it. she has asked for it these two days in a row. we started doing yoga recently with a class, however it isn't always that convenient to get to so i wanted to try a dvd. since she is young it was really hard to pick. but i am very glad i purchased this one.if you have an older child who does yoga with flowing ansanas (please forgive me if that is not the right word) then this dvd is not for you. you want something more advanced. i use the yoga zone dvd's for myself and love them. this one is a great way to introduce traditional yoga poses to your child, even if the child is older. yes there is a lot of stop start to it, but a novice will get the jist and you can move on later. as for my 2 yo, like i said she loves it...she may not be able to do the poses 100% but she will be some day. and as she gets older she can do more flowing yoga.i recommend this to all beginners from 2 - 10."
3,Irene Dunne and Gregory La Cava at low ebb,"This Universal Vault DV-R is in excellent condition: the original material seems in good condition, and the transfer is fine and there were no problems with running the disc in my DVD player. But the movie itself...! It's too obviously a late (VERY late) entry in the screwball comedy sweepstakes; unfortunately, Irene Dunne seems all wrong, she's too mature to be playing a dingbat debutante, and there's an essential sanity to her that makes her crazy antics seem worse than demented. (Irene Dunne was charming in her previous La Cava collaboration, UNFINISHED BUSINESS.) And the direction seems slack, with the gags seeming to be mistimed. It's sad to see La Cava, who was at the peak of his career a few years earlier (with MY MAN GODFREY and STAGE DOOR in 1936-37), winding down his career on this misfire."
2,not what i thought it was going to be.,"I was purchasing this book for my psychology class, and while it was the correct subject, it was a custom book edited for the Psych program at Penn State.. which is not where I go to school. Obviously, the book didn't really follow along the same way my class did. Maybe in the info it was disclosed that it was not the original version, but not in the main item listing. Kind of a bummer, and of course my school won't buy it back. So I'm stuck with a book that I have no use for. Guess I should have read the fine print."
5,Let me tell you a story...,"On this album, Glen Phillips has adopted a more narrative style than the abstract stylings of his work in toad the wet sprocket. The songs range from character studies of women in bad situations (Train Wreck, Professional Victim), to sardonically humorous narratives (Drive By). Either way, Glen Phillips has been watching the world, and this is what he sees. Great for anyone who loves a good singer-songwriter who doesn't need backup dancers or choreography to tell a story."
1,"Love Toad, but not this","What I don't understand is that Glen wrote the lyrics AND music (at least the melody, and possible acoustic guitar part) to many of my favorite Toad tunes, yet there's hardly a tune on this album that I DO like...Meanwhile, I really enjoy Lapdog, their currently one of my favorite bands, though I do miss the depth and introspection of Glen's lyrics. They were so good together. While I appreciate wanting to go different directions and being true to your own dreams, it's a shame Toad is gone!"
1,"Ugggh, cough, hack, spit!","I couldn't get to the end on this one either. Lyrics where simple(just plain stupid), the instrumentation sounded like it was bought at a music cannery, nothing special or unique on the vocals either. The 5-star reviews must have financial interests in this CD in my opinion."
4,"Glen Phillips' own ""Nebraska""","I have been a huge Toad fan for years and to say I was upset by their breakup would be a huge understatement. I kept waiting for ANYTHING to come out by any of the former members and now here it is! Glen's voice has always been one of my favorites and his songwriting (though often times very uneven) always kept me interested. At first listen I missed Toad's rich harmonies and layered sound, but after about the third listen I was hooked. This cd reminds me of Springsteen's ""Nebraska"" in that it's instrumentation is sparce and it makes you feel as if you are in the room with him listening as he tells you these stories of life's dark tragedies. My favorite track is ""Drive By"" (one of the more upbeat songs musically) if for no other reason than the lyrics are the cleaverest and funniest (as in ""did he say..."") I've heard in a long time. I highly recommend this cd!"
4,A Pop Treat from Toad's Former Front Man,"Glen Phillips, former vocalist/songwriter from the terrific Toad the Wet Sprocket, has finally released a solo album (the first full album of material from him since Toad's 1997 overlooked masterpiece ""Coil""). Musically, this album is more in line with the earlier Toad output (""Pale"", ""Bread & Circus""). Some of the edge from the band's later output is missing. Nevertheless, this is an album of great pop songs with the typical lyrics you would expect from Phillips (some quirky songs--see 'Drive By' and the single 'Fred Meyers', some moving songs--'Darkest Hour', and the standard depressing fare--see most of the other songs). Overall, this is a solid album from start to finish and well worth obtaining for any fan of Toad the Wet Sprocket."
2,Speechless,"I've long loved Toad not only for their fun melodies but more importantly for Glen's voice. For years, I've thought his voice was magically beautiful. Further spurred by the other reviews here I splurged for the DVD-Audio version, and regret it. His voice is hopelessly thin, weak and depressing. He's got a lot of cajones for releasing an album that depends so squarely on his vocal ability. He is way out of his league! After listening to this, my enjoyment of my Toad albums diminished for a while at the thought that the lush sound of the band must have masked and enhanced his delivery. Oh well, live and learn."
4,Maya,This could be the most touching love song ever written. Sometimes I get out of bed in the middle of the night just to listen to it... it makes my body ache with a mingling of pain and joy.
4,You'll love this album,"Had no idea who Glenn was until I saw him open for the Counting Crows near Seattle, WA. Not as much of the haunting melodies he wrote with Toad the Wet Sprocket, but greater personal depth. He's a hell of a performer and guitar player! Favorites on this album would definitely be 'Drive By' and 'Fred Meyer'. Favorite line on the album, ""If you think I could be replaced, forget my ear, I'll cut off my whole f*&#ing face!"" Funny, witty, talented, and deep. I am also buying his other stuff and Toad album to put in the cd mixer at the same time. Look forward to seeing him live again!"
2,Interesting ideas but ultimately a boring read,"The writing is dry, the characters are uninteresting and indistinguisable, and the dialogue is flat and lifeless. Unless you are a hard sci-fi addict with nothing else to read, there isn't much to recommend this book."
1,"Half Life is ""half baked"" at best","Tedious reading. The book starts out good and has a satisfying ending however it's what's in between that's not pleasurable reading. The story reads more like a term paper for a chemistry class than like any kind of an adventure. Theories for solving the story's conflict are proposed, explored and dismissed in a way that can only be described as pure drudgery. What I found to be lacking was action, adventure, character development or plot twists to spice up this story. The author seemed more intent upon demonstrating his knowledge of science than enticing the reader. Not recommended as reading for anyone who appreciates the usual creativity associated with the genre of science fiction but perhaps those who like pure science texts would like this book."
2,I didn't like it.,"Perhaps it's just me. Maybe my particular tastes don't mesh with this book, but I found it to be somewhat dry. Though the ideas were interesting, the execution was lacking. But, give it a shot. You may enjoy it."
2,"Awful sound, worse video","Gerald Moore is one of the great accompanists, possibly the greatest in modern times, but as a host he is stiff and affectless. The singers are also among the greatest. The music by Schubert, Handel, Haydn, Wolf, Mahler, Strauss - obviously among the greatest ever composed for the human voice. So why do I give this DVD only 2 stars? Actually, it deserves none for really poor sound and the worst pictures I have ever seen on a commercial DVD. But if you haven't seen these singers, it's worth having a look. For sonic pleasure all of them have made vastly superior recordings, as has Moore. A mere curiosity, not worth buying."
4,Best out there,"These JVC discs are probably the best that you're ever going to find. I've used about a dozen so far and only one was a problem - but it may have been my fault in trying to write the disc.All I know is that there is a lot junk out there so don't waste your money on an inferior product.JVC discs were my choice because of all the other reviews I read about their consistant quality and how other brands were subject to failure. Read up on other reviews via google and I think you'll agree.I am not a spokesperson for JVC nor do I work for them, just giving you my honest opinion. Also I read that DVD+R is better than DVD-R from a technician but I'm not a technical geek so I don't know why this is true."
5,JVC DVR+ R,I READ SOME REVIEWS ON HOW GREAT VETBITAM WAS BUT MY COMPUTER WOULDNT WORK WITH THEM PUT IN JVC AND IT WORKED FINE THIS IS MY THIRD STACK OF 50 ALL WORKED FINE VERBITAM WORKED FINE IN DVD RECORDER BUT JVC I THINK IS BETTER WORKED GREAT FOR ME .
2,NOT a bridge,"Contrary to the title, this is not an ethernet wireless bridge: don't buy if it you want to add wireless networking to an ethernet port e.g. an Xbox or Playstation.This device is something different. In fact, it's two somethings: firstly, it can be configured to be a basic access point (no firewall or routing facilities). Hook it up to your cable modem or DSL box, and have wireless access to a single computer elsewhere in your house. To be honest, there are many more powerful access point devices out there for similar $$.Alternatively, if you have one of the very limited number of supported D-Link wireless access points, this box will act as a ""repeater"": it will accept the signal and rebroadcast it, extending the range. If that's what you need, then lucky for you and five stars for the device!"
4,Great gadget with lousy documentation,"Just to add to the comments here, which are very useful and key to my eventually getting this gizmo to work, I have this set up as part of my network with a D-Link DI-713P (which D-Link does not officially support) and an Apple iBook (also unsupported). While it took me a while to tinker with it at first, it's an invisible part of my network, eradicates the deadspots that used to vex us, and has been unnoticed by the rest of my family. It supports WEP, but not WAP, so it's not as cutting edge as it could be."
5,Great Access Point for the Home,"This has a small footprint thats good for the home. I don't even notice it on my desk anymore. The configuration is super easy, it works great and the range is very impressive. I've heard of people only getting signal in the room the AP is in, but this covers my whole house."
1,Very Disappointed with DWL-800AP and Dlink Technical Support,"I purchased this product to repeat the signal of a non-Dlink brand access point. As you may know by now, this doesnt work and was not mentioned in any sales information I found from Dlink before I purchased.Also, their technical support staff was completely rude and out of line. This product is being returned. This is my first and LAST experience purchasing a Dlink product."
3,"Bugs, Bugs, Bugs!","For those trying and failing to get it set up, it should work. The problem? Bugs. It shows one MAC address for Wireless and another for Ethernet. If you run a WEP router, protecting your network by only allowing specific MAC addresses, DO NOT use the Wireless MAC address. In fact, I can't see where it's used. When I checked it through reverse lookup, both the ethernet port and a wireless connection registered as the Ethernet MAC address. Go figure.My figuring is that D-Link may have wanted to make it tough on people not wanting to repurchase a router (a D-LINK router) just to get such a device to work. They did a good job."
1,Limited Use,"This product as a repeater is made to work only with other D-Link products. If you have one of D-Links useable routers, this repeater might work."
1,Product Didn't Work,"I could not get past step two in the installation manual, connecting to the website address that makes the extender work. My browser continually indicated that the address wasn't available! What a joke that it won't work right out of the box..."
5,Works Just as Advertised,"The title says ""Wireless Range Extender"" and that's what it does.It repeats the signal of another compatible access point from D-Link. I have a DWL-900AP+ and it repeates the signal of that quite well. I was able to increase my range to cover my pool area outside. I can now be anywhere in my backyard and get a good 3-4Mbps wireless speeds.It can also be a regular access point. And in repeater mode this is easily setup and once you have it configured like the documentation says you are all set. Just put it at about the point where your signal drops out and plug it in.It is smaller than you'd think and it works quite well. The DWL-810+ is something that you can plug into your PS2, XBOX, or what have you and it will ""bridge"" that connection.This is a DWL-800AP+ and it can be an Access Point or a Wireless Repeater (a.k.a. Range Extender)."
5,"Works, once you get the right MAC address","My experience closely parallels the other reveiwers. I got stuck following the quick start guide. I used the WAN MAC address of my DLink 614+ router, not the LAN MAC address like I was suppose to. A call to tech service got me set up, but the funny thing is there no immediate indication that the DWL-800AP+ is working, other than the improved signal strength at the receiving computer. The front lights on the DWL-800AP+ looked exactly the same when I had it incorrectly configured as when it was properly set up. It took another call to tech support to reassure me that, yes, it was working. Also interesting is that you don't sacrifice any speed when using a repeater (like the DWL-800AP+). I had considered getting a bigger antenna for the router, but I think made the better choice by going with the repeater.It does what I wanted. I'm typing this in my kitchen which was previously a dead spot. It's a good choice if you are matching it to other Dlink equipment."
4,Holly and Ivy,I bought this book for nostalgia. My Mom read it to us every year at Christmas time when I was a child. Iwould recommend it for middle to older age children. The Owl may be a little scary for little ones.
5,Cute Christmas story and animated feature,"The animated version of this wonderful book was called ""The Wish that Changed Christmas"" and can be found on VHS."
5,Nostalgic,I remember my aunt reading this book to me when I was little. It was always one of my most favorite Christmas stories. I think I'll have to buy the book soon so I can have a copy of my own.
1,"This is bad, don't buy the Nokia AD-46 adapter.","First of all I don't appreciate when Nokia come out with a proprietary connector and they force you to buy another adapter to use 3rd party accessories. Second, if they are to provide an adapter that allow you to use 3rd party accessories, make sure it works properly. The AD-46 has this really loud pop when exiting a menu or ending a call. Feels like your eardrums will pop! I returned it as soon as I could. Don't buy!"
3,Not bad for the price,"I recently bought this product and found it to be pretty good for what it does. The plus side is that you can connect your own headphones to it. However, the minus side is the sound quality of the microphone. It tends to lack in some of the higher frequencies. This could very well be because this product was the first of its kind that NOKIA designed. But, I think overall, it's a good product. Further more, I would not buy it directly from them (NOKIA). It's not worth $29+."
3,Does what it is supposed to do..,"It works well and allows Nokia phones with the strange POP port to work with a standard set of headphones. It also works as the antenna for the FM radio.Even though nothing with the documentation enclosed or on the Nokia web site says so, this device DOES work with the Nokia N75 phone. One caution, even thought the description says ""Americas Retail Pk"" it is obvious that it has been packaged for Europe instead."
4,Works great (with caveats),"I like to listen to music on my Nokia 6085's MP3 player, but with this I can answer an incoming call, chat, and then resume listening to music with one button. It also has a rocker volume control on the side. CAVEATS: (1)The pop-port connector is stiff to insert, takes some getting used to. (2)At first I thought I would have to return this because every phone keypad press would create an incredibly annoying loud POP in the headphones. Fortunately, the problem can be (almost) eliminated by editing a spare profile to silence ""Keypad tones"", and then assigning that profile to the headphone mode."
2,typical propriatary nokia garbage,"This unit does work, but what really stinks (this is so typical of nokia), is making even the simplest things complex and non-durable. dont get it, get a phone that accepts standard audio jacks....."
3,Disappointing but still enjoyable,"This book had great promise and a pretty entertaining storyline, but it did not completely deliver a satisfying punch in the end. At times I was confused trying to remember who all the characters are. Still, I liked it and found it innovative and funny enough to recommend."
5,Waiting for Godot,"Steven Carter's second novel Famous Writers School feels like his 12th. His stuff comes out of I don't know where and he goes where no one else goes. He manages to be refreshingly different while at the same time entertaining and hillarious - something Joyce, Pound or Beckett couldn't even do."
3,"Should be called ""Encyclopedia of Microsoft Networking""","I suppose it is to be expected that anything MS Press puts out would be heavily slanted towards a Windows environment, but I found the book a tad too vendor-specific for my tastes. The coverage of Linux was lacking (though essentially favorable) considering its impact on modern networking, but the NetWare material seemed designed to subliminally influence the reader to sign up for a Novell to Windows 2000 Migration course.Also, I do not think the book was cross-referenced enough... there was a ""see also"" here and there, but I feel that books of this kind should contain far more, leading the reader down a winding road of understanding that ultimately returns to its point of origin.If you're an aspiring MCSE or you work in an all-Microsoft shop, then bump up my rating by one star and get a copy immediately. If you're looking for comprehensive coverage of ALL networking concepts, consider looking elsewhere."
4,great for the price,Great heat gun fro the price. I use it to charge hvac systems. Cant beat the price compared to others with stand.
1,Off to a bad start,"I know every once in awhile you get a lemon, regardless of how good the reputation of a company. Well I got a lemon here. As soon as I recieved the heat gun I turned it on, I noticed a burning smell so I turned it off. The second time I tried to turn it on I would not turn on. Going to send this one back. I am not sure if I want to take another chance on this one or not."
2,Skip the movie. Go to Brooklyn for the real thing.,"For anyone who read David McCullough's excellent book, The Great Bridge, this film will be a disappointment. Obviously, there is only so much one can fit into an hour segment, but Burns could have done with more history and less noodling commentary from people on ""what the bridge means to me."" Unlike his excellent ""The Civil War,"" ""The Brooklyn Bridge"" does not let the pictures and events speak for themselves."
5,Ken Burns Classic,"Ken Burns produces another excellent documentary. He brings life to a tale that could be otherwise uninteresting, but that is what makes Ken Burns the master storyteller that he is. Fascinating for the whole family to watch,"
5,(...) Tight!!!!!!,"this cd is amazing. I've only heard the samples so far and i have a few downloaded on audiogalaxy, and I've ordered this cd yesterday. every song on this album sounded tight. the only one i didnt really like that much iz ""if u wit it"". I wasnt really feelin that, but every other song soundz tight or acceptable. so i suggest u get up off ya (...) and purchase this album."
4,when good ol' boys turn bad...,"'The Shark-Infested Custard' has the feel of other Willeford crime novels set in Miami (eg, 'Miami Blues'). It evokes the 1970s Miami atmosphere beautifully, and his characterizations of beer-swizzling, womanizing middle-aged men are very well drawn. Yet this novel is a departure from other Willeford novels, and I've read nearly all of them, in that it is actually interlacing stories rather than a straight novel. Four buddies who play together give tell their own story from their own perpectives. These guys get into mischief, and murder. It's all very believable.Like most Charles Willeford novels, 'The Shark-Infested Custard' is probably best enjoyed by middle-aged/older men who can empathize with the plight of angst-ridden, hormonally drenched men who can't seem to grow up. Women are not likely to find it endearing whatsoever.Bottom line: one of Willeford's better novels. Recommended."
3,"Late, weaker entry from a pulp master","Not a unified novel, but interrelated stories. Willeford, like the latter filmmaker Tarrantino, revels in pushing the limit to often comedic effect. Dated details detract a little bit from the story... which weren't intended one thinks thirty some years ago.Excellent reseller."
5,Adara: by Beatrice Gormley,".The soldier heaved me over his shoulder as if i were a spring lamb - I screamed - I beat his back, hurting my hands. ""Let me go.""Adara was in the wrong place at the wrong time and before she knew it she was a slave. Brought up in the weathest family in her village she was now lower than the sevants that had looked after her all her life. This is the story of how she was brought thousands of kilometers from her home and family as a slave to a new and unknown world. It is a story of faith and trust in God and in what her can do.The book is aimed at teens and relates to the bible passage 2 Kings chapter 5 and the healing of Naaman in the Jordan river.This is a great book and certainly a worth-while read!"
2,Not recommended,"When it comes to finding historical fiction for this time period, I understand that pickings are slim. That said, my advice is to just skip it. The writing is sub-par, the plot is passable.My bigger concern was that the story contains not-so-subtle feminist and anti-marriage themes throughout. If you choose to assign this as part of your homeschool curriculum (we use TOG), I recommend discussing these aspects with your children."
4,Get's the job done,Rented one of these baby's; Sucker really humped for not beinga air hammer. Really good if you need to keep the noise down. END
2,OK if it's all you have,"I am a former Union laborer, and I have done some demo in my day. This hammer while easy to use is ah, shall we say gutless, I mean this thing has no balls. If you only have a little bit to do, or your inside, it is better then a electric demo hammer, but do not even begin to think that this thing packs the same punch as a pneumatic hammer. But it is easier to use and much better inside for light work"
2,no back up for scheduling,"I have had a Handspring Visor for 2 years. Twice it has gone blank or it simply froze. No problem, I thought. I'll just hot sink from my desktop after choosing that option. Wrong! All of the datebook items dissappeared from my desktop. This has happened twice. Also, my batteries went dead without the PDA telling me in advance. I don't know what to do now. And I cannot figure out what they mean by backup! This is just too much trouble!"
1,Piece o' junk.,"I did a considerable amount of on-line and a small amount of in-store research before I decided to give the NEO a try. It looked like it would be everything I needed in a PDA. I had heard about the 'fingerprint' problem, but I figured I'd be keeping it in a case, so no big deal. So I ordered it, it arrived, I put the batteries in, turned it on...and nothing happened. Tried 'resetting' (even though it hadn't been 'set' in the first place), nothing. Tried new batteries. You guessed it. Maybe I just got unlucky, but mine went right back in the box and on the next UPS truck out. Picked up a refurbished Palm IIIxe for about half the money I paid for the Neo and I've been delighted ever since. (The fact that the Palm doesn't absorb fingerprints like a sponge--unlike the Neo--helps things, too.)"
2,I quit working on me.,"While connected to a Magellan Companion GPS, the NEO went blank and never worked again. I sent both back with less than one hour of use."
3,Not much of an update to the Visor Deluxe,"I missed out on all the recent discounts to the Visor Deluxe in my area, but really wanted to get a PDA. As far as the PalmOS goes, I loved the features (Avantgo, Outlook integration, ebooks). However, the hardware leaves much to be desired: the glossy plastic holds fingerprints like glue, and is very slippery; the battery was down 20% after 3 days (many syncs), the backlight is weak."
4,Why I bought the Visor Neo,"I purchased my Visor Neo *because* of the AAA batteries. When I go on a business trip or on vacation to Maine, I need not lug a cradle or charger with me. I know of no place that I would go where I can't get a couple of batteries when the current ones run low (assuming I forgot to pack an extra pair)!So, all in all, I bought it because of the portability (no recharger required), the readability of the screen (just returned the Sony Clie T415), and the 8MB of RAM which allow me to keep both WordSmith and ThinkDB a fingertip away."
3,Not what I thought it was,"Not being one who closely tracks what's hot and what's not in consumer technology, I certainly would have appreciated being told prior to commitment that this Visor Neo was technology so old (10 + years) that it is completely unsupported by the manufacturer, or anyone else. I have no idea where mine has been sitting for the last several years, or if it's really a used item, or where the seller actually got it. All in all, an unpleasant surprise and disappointment. Guess I should have done more research, but didn't feel the need, based on the promotional language. On the plus side, it does do one of the simpler purposes for which I bought it."
5,Sally's tale,"""Almost to Freedom,"" by Vaunda Micheaux Nelson, is illustrated by Colin Bootman. The story is set during the era of American slavery. The book's narrator is Sally, a black rag doll owned by Lindy, a slave girl on a Virginia plantation. Through Sally's eyes we see the odyssey of Lindy and her family.The story is told in vernacular English; for example, Sally declares, ""Bein' Lindy's doll baby is a right important job."" The atmospheric, colorful illustrations effectively enhance the emotions of the story.Particularly interesting is an ""Author's Note"" at the end of the book in which Nelson explains how she was inspired to write this story. Telling the story from the doll's point of view is a memorable and effective device which contributes greatly to the success of this moving and beautifully illustrated book. ""Almost to Freedom"" is a powerful use of African-American history in a children's book."
2,Not good,"Whoever put this thing together managed to find scenes in which Connolly is about as funny as an eviscerated cat. Because Connolly is the funniest fellow still working, this must have been hard, next to unimaginable even, but evidently possible."
4,Best of Billy,"I've always loved Billy Connolly, he is among my favourite comics around. Just the fact that he can churn out new jokes over and over again for 30 years shows his talent as a comedian. He is such that old women will attend his shows and be bombarded with a torrent of F-Bombs and still leave with the impression that he's a nice guy. The best of selection goes from a very early show in the 70's to the late 90's, the latter stuff often being better. I loved the whole DVD and it's a great place to start for anyone looking to discover Billy Connolly. My personal favourite material being the joke about the guy in a bar called donkey, and the general banter about how farts make the noise they do, which he describes as your ass applauding. However, to anyone offended by f-words and the like, this is a f*cking bad place to look."
