3,"had it, lost it, don't care.","this isn't a review so moch as a gloat. Like I said, ""had it, lost it, don't care."" I still have all the SOM 7"" & Ep's (and a turn table to play them on!). To bad you kiddlies weren't there to see them Live!1"
1,Leaking Googles,Okay so the Goggles leaked. The foam seal did not seem to fit my eye shape or my wife's or any off my kids. Even with the band super tight (read cutting off blood flow to the Brain) they still had leaks. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Looked cool on the sight sucked when it came to use.
4,it's good. you should probably buy it.,"I sometimes worry that liking Eliza Carthy shows up my lack of ideological purity, but then I tell myself to get over it and not be such a snob. Even when she's more on her folk side than her pop side, she's pretty poppy, but if you're not the kind of person who objects to a lack of ideological purity, she's well worth a listen.This double CD contains a good mix of her influences, with Red containing more of the pop/electric stuff and Rice the more straight traditional stuff. Since they come together it's not worth saying which is better, and I find it changes with my mood in any case. The emotional tone ranges from upbeat to somewhat mournful, with a good bit of wistfulness in the middle. It's good study music."
3,Panasonic DVD Recorder,"This unit is very high quality. However, I did have problems formatting many of the Ram Discs by Panasonic. I called the Panasonic Support Number and the Telephone Representatives had trouble understanding the format problem. One person there offered to send me a box to return the discs that were defective, but I have not received it to date and it has been many weeks. I would recommend holding off on buying these units unless you have alot of funds for them and time for testing them etc. They may not be quite ready yet due to their newer technology."
2,Had same format problem.... :-(,"I had the same format problem as ""Reviewer: An Electronics Fan - March 23, 2002 review"" and called up Panasonic. (Could only format 2 out of 15 Memorex DVD-RAM 9.4GB Disks, then bought a ""Panasonic DVD-RAM Disk"" and that wouldn't format either!!) Phone Tech. said only problem people have called about is how to set unit up. Figuring it was a fluke, I returned the unit and ordered another which should be here by April 23. Unfortunately, I didn't see the other review until just now. A ""Fluke"" or a ""Machine which should be Recalled""? I'll know in a couple days. BTW - Still have not heard Anything from Panasonic about this problem, going on 4 weeks now."
3,Glorified VCR but it's a DVD Recorder,"I wanted a dvd recorder and this is what the salesman put in my hands. I was mislead at circut city thinking that i could back up my dvds as well as download my tivo recordings from direct tv. it works really good for the downloading the tivo stuff. but forget about the dvd backups, which is why i don't like it. as for a recorder, it works great. The manual is thick, and complicated and it will take me a lifetime to figure out probably. I hope to use it in the future for making dvd of my cam corder. It would be great if someone contacted me and told me of a way to record my dvd feed. I called panasonic and they told me it won't record copy my dvds. Bummer....."
1,Not ready for the general public yet,"I've had a similiar experience when I bought one of the first CD recorders years ago (HP). The technology isn't ready yet. First of all my $[money]Maxwell DVD RAM can't be formatted - it is 'locked' and the product won't let me unlock it until I format it ; but I can't format until it is unlocked. The physical lock on the DVDRAM wasn't set. Panasonic didn't provide a DVD-RAM disk or a DRD-R disk with the product. I also bought a $12 DVD-R disk. That worked, but it won't play on my Toshiba DVD player; it does play on my Samsung player; it poorly plays on a AudioVox personal DVD player (the player make a lot of noise like it doing lots of retries to get the data). I also bought a bunch of cheaper (no name) DVD-R disks ...When using those disks, the unit turns itself off (no error messages) after exactly 30 seconds when recording.I don't think I have a bad recorder; that's just the state of the technology."
1,Might be good if it worked!!,"I have yet to be able to hear even 1 song on the player, even normal CD's don't work - everything sounds like the chipmunks. Trying to deal with casio support is a joke - nothing on their web site (web site listed in manual doesn't even exist) and only 1 number in the manual that is open for 8 hours a day monday-friday. After 1 hour on hold (wasting my lunch hour at work) they said it is defective and they can't help without having the player sent to them or to return it where it was purchased from. I feel like I just wasted my money and time trying to deal with the problem - it is not worth it."
4,A must-read for the politically concerned,"The majority of Americans, whatever their political stripe, profess a concern about the environment. There is a general recognition among Americans (including members of both major parties) that the Democrats advocate tightening environmental legislation while the Republicans seek to be responsible to the economic needs of our country while dealing with environmental issues. Both viewpoints sound reasonable to the average American and in truth, few of them base their voting choices on environmental positions taken by the major political parties.Any potential voter wavering in his choice for president needs to read this book. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. blows the lid off the extent in which George Bush has sacrificed environmental concerns for the short-term gains of his corporate contributors.Jeremy W. Forstadt"
1,"One of the most ignorant, one-sided books ever written","This book is well written, but the examples in the text are non-documented and can not be proven. Even far left wingers with any common sense should not take it seriously. Just like the Kennedy senator, Robert will dispute any positive or constructive accomplishment by the current admistration. Instead of author, he should give himself the titles: Fanatic, Psycho, Schitzo, or traitor. Any of these would be more accurate."
1,Started to laugh when I read the title,Most people grow out of this kind of good versus evil portrayal of the world in their mid 20s.
1,Isn't It Ironic?,"Robert F. Kennedy is a regular on the talk show and book promoting circuit where he rails against George W. Bush and bemoans the average American's ownership of gas-guzzling SUV's.Of course, he never mentions that he flies to each of those promotional appearances in his private jet which is then met bya stretch Lincoln towncar. When Kennedy starts flying coach anddrives a Prius, maybe he'll carry a bit more credibility."
1,Ideological and unscientific,"Kennedy seems to disregard all science in order to further his worldview and agenda. He has gotten a ton of publicity for this book, but please be sure to take it with a heavy dose of salt."
5,Wake up America.,"I would like to think that we live in a democratic country and that our government in Washington keeps watch on the safety of the air we breath, the water we drink, and the food we eat. This book tells me, with substantial and compeling supporting evidence, that all of the above is wishful thinking. In fact, the government is for sale to the highest bidders and these are corporations whose priorities often run contrary to the interests and safety of the people. We are paying and will pay dearly in the future for this estate of affairs."
4,crimes against nature,"Thank God there are people who care about our environment and our democracy. A must read to make the public aware of the corporate control of our government, radio, TV, and News Media.... Very informative."
3,"Incomplete at best, but very provocative.","This book is a no-holds-barred polemic, going for the jugular vein on the sad state of our environment today. Sadly, it is deficient in its factual accuracy and objectivity. For a much stonger, meticulously researched book on the global crisis in biodiversity, see ARK OF THE BROKEN COVENANT: PROTECTING THE WORLD'S BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS, by John Charles Kunich. It is unfortunate that a book must be a wild-eyed vitriolic screed to attract much public attention to the environmental tragedies all around us. But if CRIMES AGAINST NATURE motivates many people to wake up and begin searching in earnest for the truth about what is happening to our planet, causing them to read far more worthy books, then it will be a success."
4,story of the river,"this is the story of a year on the river filming the life there, including the life of the otters"
2,difficult to fill pipe and insert into sleeve,"A lot of parts, but instructions are excellent. Filling pipe with cement fully assembled was extremely difficult - maybe my mix wasn't thin enough - had to use copper pipe to force cement down. Be prepared with helper and have patience. Putting pipe in took four guys and if you don't get pipe in EXACTLY straight, edge will catch on plastic insert and it will not go in (and will dig into plastic sleeve). I have installed a fixed pipe board before with larger diamter and if I had it to do over, I would buy that one - it was A LOT easier to fill and mount and given the weight of the filled pipe, I won't ever remove this one from the ground :-)!"
1,Big Box Little Reliability,"When I purchased my Dell Computer the sales person said they would ""up grade"" me with this printer. I thought, FANTASTIC, it proved to be a big disappointment. Fax mode takes 3 to 4 minutes to send out the scanned sheets. The inks ran out in the printer and when I replaced them with their expensive ink the system totally went down with no prints and the unit telling me that there was no ink in the new and functioning ink cartridges. When I called the DELL Service (or lack of Service) number, their representitive (from a place he could not tell me where) told me to go and buy a new printer as they could not help me and then thanked me for using DELL's service line. No follow up on my call was ever acknowledged. Junk from DELL IS HELL!"
2,Don't buy this for the love of god,"For a little while i guess this printer does an OK job. It's a little slow but I can live with that. The scanning and copying isn't too bad. But it's been a little less than a year and this printer is the worst part of my life. It takes me over half an hour to print a 3 page report. It jams all the time. I can't even put multiple sheets of paper in the tray, I have to feed it paper one at a time for it to print. And I have to mention again, it jams like crazy. Just now I got so mad at it I punched my table and have an aching hand. I will never buy a printer from Dell again and I highly recommend no one does either."
4,Printer still kickin'!,"My 944 is still going strong after all these years and it is fast. Our Kodak 7200 series is a joke, so I brought the 944 back out and so far it is working like a dream. It gets good mileage on the ink, and has a nice interface for printing options. It's no high end Epson but it gets the job done without all the extra software, which I find annoying.Getting this used right now would be a decent decision. Mine is ancient compared to the stuff that's out there now, but at least it works right.I'll admit it does some funky stuff sometimes like eat more than one sheet of paper from the tray at a time. This is my second one.But, hey, it works. And the ink right now is a steal!! The Kodak printers that boast $10 ink are a joke. The ink runs out in a week from LIGHT usage. In comparison, what have you got to lose, really?"
3,Quick read,This book started out good but got pretty predictable after awhile. It was also very slow and boring in some parts.
3,heavy but not that bad,just purchased for myself. but it is heavy and huge for my desk.it is working fine though.
2,"Serves its purpose, but...","Works as advertised, a real bummer is the lack of transformer spaced outlets, that will really limit how many plugs you can use. If you do have transformer plugs as most do on their computers somewhere, there are better options in APC's line for just a few extra dollars."
2,"Mediocre, at best","Pros: Protects laptop against basic scratches, bumps, etc; laptop fits well.Cons: Interior produces bad static when taking laptop out, to the point that holding my hand over the bottom vent will cause a spark. NOT something you want in a case.Bottom line: This case does the bare minimum, and not particularly well. Other notebook sleeves will do the same job, and without shocking your computer. Personally I am looking to replace mine."
3,Great interior protector,"I just use this cover for long trips and to cover my laptop on my house. The description said that it is designed for a 15.4"" laptop, but when you are closing it gives you the sensation that it won't close."
3,3 stars for the voice and vim,"Who wouldn't/couldn't/doesn't love Bernadette Peters? Her voice, interpretation and all-around style signify star quality. I loved her in person in Annie Get Your Gun. I didn't ""get"" her as GYPSY""S Mom, or on this CD,either. It was on my wish list, but I could only stand listening to the angst-driven offering once, before I tossed it in a bin... The lyrics are that overwrought and maudlin. The background laughter and applause from the audience includes pauses & patter that are intrusive and annoying. The most tender song is Time Heals Everything, from Mack and Mabel. Please let someone revive this underrated musical; Bernadette could still pull it off..........."
2,Sorry....,As a fan of Sondheim and Ms. Peters -- I have to say that this simply misses the mark. They should have gone into the studio.
1,"Sooner or later,this will drive you crazy","We all know the great musical composers-Rodgers&Hammerstein,Lerner&Lowe and Andrew Lloyd Webber.Well,we're getting to know the world's worst composer-Stephen Sondheim.Sondheim's music is like fingernails on a chalkboard,and his ""musical hits""(HITS????)are plotless and repititious.Here is another one of the bland CDs Sondheim has churned out.It's a shame that the wonderful Bernadette Peters wasted her talents in singing the songs from Sondheim's duds.Enough already,Sondheim!Isn't having to put up with bloodthirsty barbers,tacky ragtime and fairy tales slapped together enough?Must we suffer through THIS schlock and twaddle as well?"
5,fabulous,"If I was allowed to own only one Bernadette Peters CD, this would be the one. She sounds wonderful, and what she does with all the songs is priceless. This CD is a must-have."
5,Irish Cheese Review,I was basically familiar with each of the cheeses. I bought them based through Amazon.com on the confidence in the product and the company. The service was exactly what you had said it would be. Our guests thoroughly enjoyed the cheeses and were amazed that they were all from Ireland.Will definitely be back next year--if not sooner.
5,Excellent!,"Sent this as a Christmas gift to my nephew and his new wife who live in America, as she had commented on how nice Irish cheese was when over here for a visit last year.They were absolutely delighted..........!"
5,Great Book of Facts!,"I gave this to my husband for Christmas, and he has not been able to put it down since! We couldn't believe that it already had everything from the September 11 tragedy in there. It is a real keepsake item!"
4,An Almanac,This book has a ton of information that people can use in one book. I was doing a report and I looked in here and there is a ton of information so you better buy this book if you need lots and lots of information on one little thing! So buy it today!!!!!!=)
2,"NOT a ""Complete Reference""",I did not learn ONE new thing from this book. Been using 2001 for a few months now and already know the basics.Book may serve newbies well but offers NO instruction on advanced features.What we need is a Manual like Microsoft used to ship that covers EVERYTHING.I have waited 2-3 months for this and find it useless. Sorry to be negative but want a lap-reading book that covers the software from A to Z.
4,A good guide to office 2001,This is a very well presented guide to using the new Office suite. It contains very useful tips that even experienced users of earlier versions will find useful. I made severeal beneficial changes to my preferences as a result. It is a very well illustrated book that can be used as a reference guide as well as being read. The authors provide contact information so that more esoteric problems can be addressed. I have just used it to learn how to create hyperlinks and how to use sounds from other email clients in the Entourage email suite. I recommend this large paperbook as a good starting point for learning more about the capabilities of the software.
2,Not up to par with Freddie the Fish,"I purchased this thinking it would be a good computer game for older children. It's nowhere near as good as Freddie. As a matter of fact, it bores even the younger children AND the older children would rather play Freddie. If you're in the market for computer games, Freddie the Fish are the best."
4,a strong and intelligent album,"I agree with my verbose co-reviewer- good!I've had a hard time getting this album, but it was worth it. This was surprising and sad after what seemed to be a decent amount of success of Heartworm- which is hands down one of the best moody rock albums ever. While I liked Heartworm better, this one is still very strong and has very emotional music. These guys don't screw around with sappy superficiality. Strength and honesty don't come together in 'pop' music (or any music) very often, and when it does, as here, it really affects how one defines 'good' music. Whipping Boy is one of the few bands making this sort of music."
2,GE 27930GE3 2.4 GHz Cordless Telephone,"I bought this phone at Office Max for the same price as Amazon ($$$). The price was good and the phone felt good in the hand. I liked the antenna lighting up - it gave a visula indication that it was working, but I wonder how much extra battery-time it sucks up. The clarity was good as long as you were near the base. BUT, the volume was too low, even at the highest setting. I kept having to ask my caller to repeat what they said. I also did my usual test of going outside and seeing how far away I could go before the signal became noisy. I barely got out the door before I got all this crackling and static. The range was no where near my two other 900 MHZ phones. Back to the store for a refund with this unit. Bottom Line: Nice features, nice price, poor performance."
1,Even though it's cheap....it's not worth the money,"Even though the reception was ok, I quickly got discouraged with this phone. I guess it's true you get what you pay for...unfortunately. First the CID screen started getting scratched up, even though it wasn't being mishandled. Then, suddenly, I noticed it would take 2 - 3 times to dial out and get a connection. At first, I thought it was the phone company or my lines on my house. Then one day I just happened to hear what was going on with it. After pressing the buttons on the phone, you hear the phone's buttons emit their tone and afterward you should hear the actual dialing out of the number for the tone dialing setting. Well some of the numbers weren't dialing out and it was random to any number at different times... i.e. #2, #5 and #7...it seems like an odd problem to me. I've had this phone for more than 6 mos at least so I guess I'm stuck with it...so buyer beware."
2,This is an Analog Phone. DIGITAL is always better!,This is an analog phone (not digital). GE (as many others) do a sneaky job of advertising it as 2.4 GHz without touting that it is an analog phone. When checking out phones pay attention to analog vs digital. Digital is more secure and of better quality. A 900Mhz DIGITAL phone will most always be better then any 2.4 GHz ANALOG phone.Another thing bad about this phone is they way the Caller ID screen sticks out it gets scuffed up after a short period of use. I imagine that after a year of use you will not be able to view the caller ID screen. This is just bad design.On a good note the way I do like the way the stubby antenna lights up when the phone rings.
1,Works for about a month.,"Initially, I was thrilled with this phone. After a month or so, however, the reception deteriorated. Now there is a constant popping sound, which is incredibly annoying!!! It's so bad that I'm now shopping for a new phone. Don't make the same mistake I did -- falling for cool looks and a low price. Buy a different phone and save yourself the aggravation."
1,Worst phone I ever purchased,"I liked the looks of this phone, the attractive price and the 2.4 GHz. However, when I set up the phone and used it after the required battery charge period, I was very disappointed! The sound quality is just poor. Not just ""tiny/metallic"" but annoying is a better word that comes to mind. At first I couldn't hear the other person, so I turned up the volume - yes, it got louder but so did the noise. The signal to noise ratio must be incredibly bad. I originally purchased the phone so that I could carry it with me outside - at least to the back yard - yet the reception was so bad that I couldn't hear the caller. And this being only 25 yards or so... while my 900 MHz Uniden was able to receive calls a 1/4 mile away.Poor quality, poor reception... don't buy this phone."
2,GE model # 27930ge3-p cordless phone,"The model # 27930ge3-p cordless phone i purchased at k-mart in london ky just over a year ago quit working whenever i hit the talk button i get 3 beeps but no dial tone. I tried to contact GE about my prob. but that was impossible. They make you go thru some outfit called Thompsons who handles their phone products for them and you can't get thru this outfits voice mail layers to speak with a real person. After spending 15 min working my way thru their automated voice system, it finally instructed me that if I had the phone over a year it was out of warrenty and if it had quit working i should get rid of it and buy a new one. As far as I am concerned GE does not have any customer support for their phones."
3,Mediocre phone,"I bought this phone from Wal-Mart. They advertised it as having a visual voice mail indicator. It hasn't worked at all for me. Other than that, I haven't much problem with it, except that it's hard to hear other callers...even with the volume turned up.I guess it's going back to Wal-Mart!"
4,Great features for the price,"The sleekly curved design of the GE 27930 will fit in perfectly with modern interiors, but it offers more than just another pretty face. It automatically switches between 40 channels to maintain an interference-free line, and has a clever antenna that flashes, as a visual indicator in addition to the standard ring. Face-up charging allows you to read the three-line LCD panel easily, while the flash, page/intercom and redial buttons provide convenient options for checking in with call waiting or tracking down the handset when it's lost under the couch. The 10-station speed dialer allows you one-touch access to your most frequently called numbers, while the Caller ID memory will track up to forty names and numbers, each with the time and date stamp of the original call."
4,GE Cordless Phone,"I purchased this phone several months ago and am really happy with it. I ended up purchasing another one for a friend for her 60th birthday. She too is very happy with it. The only thing I don't like is that I cannot see the caller ID display too good without my glasses but that is a personal issue, not a problem with the phone. I find very good clarity with the phone and if I needed more, I would buy more. Another good feature is that since I have voice mail through my telephone company, this phone is compatible with it and a light flashes to let me know that I have a message waiting. Thanks GE."
1,Don't waste money on this phone,"I have owned numerous cordless phones over the years, and I must say this one has by far the poorerst sound and reception quality. Another reviewer pointed out that the phone is analog rather than digital, perhaps that is why. I have overwhelming static when I walk more than 30 feet away from the base. I also own a Sony Digital 2.4 GHz phone and receive great reception even INSIDE my neighbor's house! Of course, it cost almost 4x more than this phone, but you get what you pay for in this case."
1,The annoying popping noise,My dad bought this phone. We were all excited that it would work even if we wanted to walk to our mailbox or the next door neighbor's because of its 2.4 GHz. The phone worked great for about a month but now there is this constant fuzzing/popping noise that we cant get rid of. Its not only on our line but the person that you are talking to can hear it too! Its so annoying.
3,Not for the vison impaired,"My husband bought this phone (GE27930) a couple weeks ago to replace our very expensive Sprint cordless that just died one day. I was very excited when I first opened it and my teenage daughter thought it was SO cool the way it lights up when it rings. It is a very good looking phone.However...the ""backlit"" display is irritating to read. The light comes from the left side primarily and it makes it hard to read unless you have a light behind you. Also the display seems very small and hard to read. The worst thing about the phone is that sometimes the phone will ring yet the display will show nothing. I'm not sure why it does this but it is very irritating.When you are used to a Mercedes it is hard to go back to driving a Pinto I guess.For the price the phone is not bad.Just be ready to squint."
2,Not so good,I've had this phone for almost a year. It was working fine but lately the number keys do not work. So I now have to replace it.
2,Hard to hear and battery doesn't last,"I've had the phone for about 5 or 6 years and the battery doesn't last more than 30 minutes when talking on it.The phone is also has static, so it is a little hard to hear the person you are talking to."
2,"Good short term phone, but buttons stop working after <1yr","I got this on sale for $20, phone worked great for almost a year - caller ID, hold, memory, good voice quality - but then the top row of the keypad and the ""TALK"" buttons started getting very hard to push and now I have to work really hard to pick up the phone, and can't dial 1 2 or 3! Good short term phone, bad long term investment."
2,won't last,"This phone was decent for about 10-12 months, then it started having all sorts of problems and now I'm looking for a new phone. It gets 2 stars b/c I really did like the features. Good display, decent looking. A bit bulky, but well placed buttons. They just need to work on the quality, I can't afford to buy a new phone every year."
4,"Wow, what a phone!","I absolutely love this phone, and have had it for aboutsix months now! For comfort, good looks, great receptionand a totally reasonable price ... thisis a fantastic choice..."
5,Loved This Book!,This is an excellent book on the Civil War! I don't usually care for books on war because battle details and war strategy is so boring to me but Albert Marin makes it all so interesting by not going into too much technical detail while interjecting lots of fascinating side facts about people and events throughout. I fell in love with General Lee. He was truly an honorable man and a military genius. I wish this were required reading in school as it is a balanced look at the heroes and horrors of the Civil War.
4,A solid reference tool for the novice angler in Arizona.,"Fishing Arizona presents the reader with a substantial grip on fifty fishing locations within three regions of Arizona. Information that is specific to each location includes species of fish that are availible, general information about the location, as well as some honorable fishing spots. Although the information is intended toward the amateur angler, even the expierienced fisherman can use the information to his/her advantage."
5,Está excelente,"Está excelente, vienen sus mejores canciones, 3 temas inéditos, Desesperada 2004, Soldados del amor 2004, sus videos, el making off de Desesperada, una entrevista y por si fuera poco una versión acústica de Profundo valor. Comprenlo ya."
4,Timeless,Even disco/dance music sounds good in Spanish...glad to have finally discovered this artist...great range and variety in this compilation.
5,Work Design: Occupational Ergonomics,This book had a lot of useful information regarding ergonomics and I plan on keeping it around to use once I get out in the field. I recommend this to anyone that has an ergonomics class or needs additional knowledge related to ergonomics.
1,No no no,"What they offer is what you are not going to get. This telescope is to watch the moon and landmarks, you need to buy additional equipment to see more. The Autostar never works no matter how perfectly you follow the direction, you will never get to see what you want, unless you do it manually and with a star/sky map. Worst of all: is Made in China, after two days the screw to hold the lenses stop working...Recommendation: Stay away of this."
4,Anthony Rapp Rocks,"I am enamored by the diversity of Anthony Rapp. I have yet to see a ceiling on his talent. This movie puts a new twist on 'company morale'. It is a simple story with a lot to say. Three men duke it out over love and policy. It's amazing these men can get anything done at work with the intense personal intolerance they hold for each other. I recommend this movie to those whose frustration with corporate BS surfaces daily, the boss who looks down on people (my place of business is filled with them) and the employees too scared and paranoid to even breathe. Good show!"
3,floppy disc failures (my device or these discs ??),"In my work I have to copy & restore databases to old scales frequently. I understand that magnetic floppy discs are prone to failure, especially as they age. I can usually use and reuse a disc many times before I have a failure. I purchased these discs because they were ""New"" and not ""remanufactured"". I have experienced failures after copying the database to a disc sucessfully and restoring it once without issue, but the second copy/restore fails: the disc appears to copy without an error but fails to restore. I can not be certain that the issue is not with my old disc drives (I have two) but the problem seems to occur with greater frequency than ever before with this last batch of discs. I now have to use a disc only once to be certain that I dont loose data & waste time."
3,Not great customer service,"I have had a few disks which didn't work for some reason. This is extremely problematic as I am required by law to store my work and be able to reproduce it in the future. I e-mailed the company and they never even responded. Am thankful that Amazon carries these disks as they are hard to find, but was disappointed in the lack of response from the vendor."
4,My most purchased item off amazon,I like this product and whoever carries it. We still use these floppys and they are getting harder and harder to find in bulk. Thank you for having them on hand.Thank you!
5,Medigrip Tubular Bandage,"After visits to a Wound Care Clinic, I was introduced to this product. It afforded me just enough compression to help heal some stubborn leg ulcers. Being able to purchase this through Amazon was a great find and the price was the lowest I could find."
3,Okay. Cut kind of small,"At least that is what my wife said. They are very tight, but she ordered her usual size (she said she is not getting fat- I offer no comment). Also the pad is not very thick. I guess that is personal preference. The finish is pretty good. If it had a better pad I would have rated it 4 stars. If you like a minimal pad, then it should be good."
4,Other than the fact that they're really small,"thye seem like a well made pair of cycling shorts. Unfortunately, I had to return them to order the next size up and when I went to re-order they were sold out. Very disappointing that they don't have a better return policy. You have to re-order a whole new order instead of being able to do an exchange by mail. Oh well."
2,"not so comfy, minimal padding","The interior lining of these bike shorts are very tight, especially at the bottom where it fits around the thigh, making them pretty uncomfortable. The exterior portion of the shorts were exceptionally baggy. The padding is almost non-existant. Also, the tight inner lining makes it impossible to pull the shorts up higher than the waistline, so they tend to ride a little low if you have much junk in your trunk."
3,Good introduction to poems,"I thought this was a good introduction to poetry for children a little silly but funny and interesting enough to hold their attention some of the time, entertaining for kids."
5,Simply Hilarious!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the best collections of children's poetry I have come across (and I consider myself a connoisseur). These poems are hilarious- sometimes didactic, sometimes fanciful and absurd-- they all appeal to the humorous sensibilities of children (and adults). This has worked for me as an extremely successful present on many an occasion- highly recommended!!!"
2,Not so silent,"Bought this single speed fan based on Nexus' claim ""World's Quietest fan!"" It replaced an Antec 3 speed fan of the same size. The Antec fan at it's lowest speed (1200 RMP)was quieter and a better value. I used this Nexus for a week and replaced it with another Antec."
4,Good Starter Set,"As an occassional weekend golfer who found himself in a position to begin playing more golf, this set has proven to be a good investment. A complete set for the cost of some overpriced single clubs, this is a good start for the majority of players for whom the issue in their game is not the clubs.No doubt, as my game progresses I'll want to move on, but in the meantime, this is a good set that gives me all I need to get started and to do so economically.A good starter set, adequate for most players who need to work on and learn the game before they need to worry about their clubs. A great starter set for beginners or occassional weekend golf-warriors."
5,so amazingI,"I have listened to this album over and over again.when I am driving or just at home relaxing.Darwin Hobbs always lifts me into the presence ofGod making me want to dance, sing and praise the lord! I have his new album also which is great! Although my favorite is so amazing. I can never get enough of his music. I thank God for such an awsome Psalmist."
5,LOVE THEM!,"I love this ring set. They look great worn together, or seperately. The rings are feminine, but also incredibly durable. They have a very nice weight to them. I would definitly buy again from this seller."
3,"Heavy and beautiful, but....","I received these rings very quickly and I loved them IMMEDIATELY. They are very heavy, with a quality feel to them, and they are super comfortable to wear, very smooth. BUT, that evening (the first day!) I looked down at them and noticed a stone had already fallen out somewhere! I am hugely disappointed, to say the least. Not sure if I want to try again. Haven't contacted the company yet, but hopefully they will send me a refund or a new ring."
2,"pretty but, purple stone is very very light in color","it's ok. found something similar at red envelope but, they were out of stock. had hoped this would be a little ""more."""
5,I Love this Disc!,"I came across cyberCHUMP searching for cool electronic music and these guys are great! I think their music is great for driving. Its like space exploration music, a combination of exotic world sounds with hilarious audio snipets and great dreamy grooves. This is a disc that I keep near my computer and use for surfing the net! It gets my recommendation!"
4,Complete (modern) history of Ireland to 2003,"A thorough, highly detailed account of the current history of Ireland, especially political. An extremely long book (750+ pages not counting indices) and you have to get used to Coogan's writing style that no sentence shall be less than 50 words long with multiple phrases embedded. This is an excellent account of the evolution of modern day Ireland. Coogan knows the internal political scene well and gives considerable weight to detailing it. This tends to take away somewhat from the readability since as a North American, I'm not familiar with the multitude of names that I'm sure are second nature to an Irishman like Coogan. Nevertheless, I feel that I came away with a better understand of how the Irish situation has developed and it did give me new and better background in which to frame my thinking. Recommended reading but only for true, non-fiction, history buffs."
1,i hate this book,"i cannot learn from this stupid book, if you have never seen probablity before good look once you hit it wiht this book, its just so bland, they barely explain anything, im learning from other books...this book is horrible."
5,Enterprise C's Captain Garrett finally gets her first novel,"Enterprise C finally gets a chance as full length novel! Captain Garrett and her crew are fighting the notorious Orion Syndicate. We get to learn more about the Captain and her crew. Making a single episode appearance in Next Generation's ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" Garrett left an indelible impression on many fans as a great leader in the tradition of Janeway and Kirk.This Lost Era novel should be the start of an Enterprise C series. I found Ilsa J. Bick's portrayal of the characters to be just as inspired as any of the other novels in the series."
1,As bad as an episode of Voyager,"I found this book extremely difficult to get through and very much a disappointment following my delight at the first two books in this series. It drags on and in my opinion works too hard to put people where the need to be for the ending. Garrett was nothing like the character seen in Yesterday's Enterprise. Instead, she was more like Janeway. I was hoping for a stronger character like Kira (DS9)."
1,Psycho-Babble as a Techno-Babble Substitute,"Boring and banal, the characters in this book are some of the most introspective, self-centered Star Trek characters ever. Garrett is so annoying and immature that she ALMOST makes Archer look good. Like Archer, and unlike most Star Trek captains, I would not have followed Garrett through a revolving door. Too long, too convoluted, and even at nearly 500 pages, attempted to do too much in too little space. Reading this novel was WORK until the last 100 pages or so. Where I typically have spent 2-3 days reading each of the Lost Era novels to date, I spent well over two weeks on this one. (I even preferred household chores to reading it.) Had I not been flying a great deal, I probably would still be reading it. Read it only if you feel compelled (as I did) to read the entire series."
2,Another long-winded Lost Era book,"The best way to begin this may be with a guide. This book has 465 pages. Around page 100, there is a good scene. At 200 there is another. Close to 300 the action begins. After that, the book is quite solid, well written and entertaining. However, most of the first three hundred pages consist of long, boring internal monologues by just about every named character in the entire book about how and why their severe mental problems make them anti-social. It's boring, it's irritating, it's pointless - and it just keeps going, one character after another. In the ""about the author"" section it says this is her first novel. Unless she improves drastically, she would obviously be better off sticking to short stories. Those in Strange New Worlds were brilliant, so this was a real disappointment."
2,What a downer for women in lead roles,"I would have thought that the rare opportunity to put a female in a leading, respectable role would be a treat. However, Captain Rachel Garrett comes accross as so incredibly immature, and so totally dependant on men (her pining for her ex, taking out her frustrations on her new XO) that it made me wonder how this woman would possibly be able to graduate from the academy - she would be a cartoonish caricature even in today's world. There is no way anyone of either gender would be able to look up to her, and to trust her judgement in tense situations. Snappy, childish, immature. Ugh!Overall, I thought the book opened really nicely, the prologue was great but then it was kind of dropped. A little more detail there would have been great.I have read the first 4 books in hte ""lost era"" series. This may be the one that prevents me from reading the last 2. It was that bad."
3,The Lost Era ... a 'fill-in',"The problem I had with this book is the very reason for its existence: little bearing on any of the television series characterizations. I seldom 'heard' the characters speaking as I read on. In the very best books of Star Trek, I visualize the characters relating to one another as the scenes play out. But things that are merely alluded to in the main line novels are filled in rather well by this story."
3,A good start,"For a first novel, this was a good story and a great start to a blooming career. Unfortunately, I fought my way through the book often finding other things to do rather the read.I truly enjoyed the creative use of internal dialog of the point of view character. Seeing these similar discussions that I often have with myself, immediately brought me into the characters. I was distracted since each character was written in a different style.The story felt labored. The prologue was not tied to until very late, and every sub-plot came together perfectly, almost too perfectly. It would have been better to see some be resolved at different times rather then all at once.I loved the story and the idea. I have to recommend the book. It was good, but not perfect. I am looking forward to other novels by Ilsa Bick."
3,Wood buyer's guide,"The book is pretty good. I am a novice woodworker. Having a reference for the types of woods, the types of cuts and the benefits of each is very helpful. I will make fewer mistakes."
2,not a good choice....even for the price,I bought this about two years ago and it was a great deal...or so I thought. I used it with a Canon XSi. It is very light (flimsy) but has great features for a cheap tripod. The main problem is that the metal screws on the adjustment pegs tear this thing to peices. If you slightly turn one too far it will split the plastic in half. Mine actually cracked (the first time)sometime during a move and setting it up. The next one I was responsible for. Just very cheaply made and thats what I expected for the money. If you can afford it step up to something that will last. Hope this helps!
2,Broke after 3rd use...,"The build quality is super cheap but so was the price, so it's worth it right? Only if you are VERY careful pulling the legs out... This is a very delicate tripod and one that breaks very easily. Also the panning is not very fluid, but rather jerky. Yes I know this is a $10 tripod, what do you expect? I didn't expect the leg to come off, and then the buckle, and then another leg! So ask yourself, do you really want to trust the safety of your $1000 DSLR to a flimsy tripod?"
2,tripod missing parts,"The tripod arrived properly packaged but was missing the camera connecting plate. Also, no instructions were included as to the use and care and when I tried to set up the tripod, one leg did not extend properly---I could hear a lose part rattleing around inside the tube---probably the part that controlled the leg---the leg was useless, would not lock, so I returned the whole thing for refund. Lose screw or something, who knows."
1,Horrible Tripod. Invest a few extra bucks and avoid this one,"This tripod is horrible. After just 3 days of use the rod that raises it up and down snapped; it came off the track and I can't get it back on. Luckily, when this happened, I managed to catch my $3000 camera as it tipped over.The panning is NOT fluid. It sticks and you can never get a good shot. It's never level when the rod is raised up (prior to it breaking!) since it's so flimsy. It rocks back and forth (the rod) with the slighest breeze. You might as well just not even use a tripod.Save your money and invest an extra $10-$20 to get something professional. This one truly sucks."
2,missing set screw on one leg,The tripod was sent to us with a set screw missing on one leg. The leg kept falling off. I had to take the tripod apart and look for a screw that would fit. Sent from the factory without being checked I assume.
1,Crappy Plastic used,"My first review on Amazon----I bought this product last year, Sometime in Jan(2010), Used it only a couple of times before the plastic inside broke sometime in March 2010. There is absolutely no way to fix it. Cause there is a plastic ring inside one of the legs and it got cut into two. I checked the quality of the plastic,It was pretty brittle. Contacted the seller twice, they refused to reply to my emails.I have been using it since then with certain modifications, I put on some Tap, and instead of using 3 levels of Heights, I just use two.It is a little too light, Hence if you use this in a Windy place during night, You get bad shots.For a beginner, I would recommend this cause this is more like an experimental one before you buy a better one."
2,Very unstable and low quality plastic knobs,The plastic knob cracked just after 1 day of use. It is very light weight and not suitable for handling the weight of SLR cameras.
3,You get what you pay for.,"I'm pretty new to DSLR photography and just needed something to allow me to occasionally take family photos and some low light/long exposure stuff so I didn't want to spend a bunch of money. This tri-pod will get the job done but I question it's longevity due to poor design, material and craftsmanship. It's exceptionally lightweight but that's about the only highlight.I plan on using this until it breaks and then picking up something well built.I would only recommend this for a beginner who just needs something infrequently and doesn't want to spend any money."
1,It's pure junk,"This thing is a piece of crap. I used it 2 times around my house and the third time I pulled it out of it's carrying case one of the legs had come unglued. Yes, unglued. It is very flimsy and cheap. I guess you get what you pay for. I wish there was a way to give it negative stars, because that is what it deserves."
1,Doesn't sit strait,"Overall for the price this thing costs its great. I would probably give it 5 stars even though its not the best quality.I'm only giving it one star because mine doesn't sit perfectly strait. It doesn't matter how sturdy or how many features or whatever this thing has if all my pictures are tilted to the left by a few degrees.... Yes I know how to adjust it, but the adjustment is already at its maximum."
3,I kinda sorta would maybe recommend this... a little,"Loved this when I received it. I was using it for a relatively small point and shoot camera. My main goal was to take photos of the moon. It worked out pretty nice for a while.Things started to go down hill when i got my SLR ( a NIKON D100 ) The weight of the camera and my new frequency of use stared to where down the tripod. The legs started to lose their strength. They would slowly slip into each other, shrinking while i was using it. Obviously a big pain in butt.I eventually went out and grabbed a larger and much more sturdy tripod.If your looking for a light use and and very convenient tripod then definitely pick this up. If your plans are leaning toward lots of shots then go bigger and make the investment."
2,Out of balance. Leg broke the second week.,"The balance/level bubbles would be awesome if they were plumb with tripod. Needs a book under one leg to get it level. Forget using the telescoping feature, it just throws the lean even farther off. The 2nd week using, one leg broke (pulled out when extending it) I was definitely pampering this poor thing, not yanking legs out with any excessive force. I was trying to milk its use out as long as I could.Bought the heavy duty Gorilla tripod and found it much more flexible and reliable."
4,Very good,"I find it very convenient and easy to use. No problems in adjusting height and securing it tight. No screws to tighten. Our earlier tripod, though worked good for some time, the screw tightening turned out to troublesome."
4,more than expected.,"It is worth to buy. more than you pay for. easy to use and works great. I gave 4 stars because the camera holder is a little inconvenient to attach to camera. Otherwise, everything is great"
2,They just shouldn't produce items this cheap,"This is no fault of 47th. Street Photo, but this tripod is junk. The price is so cheap that I selected it for my wife because she is interested in photography and I thought it would be a good starter model. I planned on replacing it with something better if she ended up actually using it.The plastic on the tripod is very cheap and brittle. She tried to turn the crank to extend the camera upwards and the plastic gear broke off some spokes, rendering useless the ability to raise and lower the camera. Also, the camera doesn't seat into the top very well. It's wobbly. When you turn the camera on it's side to take a portrait picture, I was actually afraid it would come loose.With the shipping, all I did was add $22.00 to the price of the new tripod I will end up purchasing. Bottom line: They just shouldn't make things this cheap. Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for something that will last longer than 2-3 days."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"While this product is labeled as a digital tripod it is certainly not for use with a DSLR. The quick release mechanism, while it sounds like a good idea, is not (unless you want to keep it attached to your camera at all times). The product is poorly made but the design concept is good. On the positive side, it is light and portable. The leveling bubbles are a nice touch. On the negative side is the instability of the quick release mechanism. If you put a DSLR on it, it will wobble. The wing nut controlling the horizontal rotation did not function and returning the product for this is not worth the grief. Do your self a favor and spend a little more money for a more substantial product. You'll be happier in the long run."
3,Not for heavy DSLR,"The head on this tripod is somewhat weak and does hold a heavy DSLR, I.E. Nikon D200, very steady. The camera would wobble for 2 to 4 secs after pressing the shutter release, making it unusable for slow shutter speed work.This would be OK for a light compact or small DLSR."
2,Weaksauce,"I don't know what I was expecting, but this tripod was very weak. the legs were flimsy, the mount for the camera always made me worry that my Sony Alpha-100 would fall off, and the telescoping mid-section couldn't bear the weight and would drop down suddenly. Get something slightly more expensive and thank yourself later."
4,as advertised,"very fast shippping. as advertised.. camera seems to glide from side to side, no sticking or catching. very good product, very stable"
2,Tripod Broken after Minimal Usage,"I am by no means a professional photographer so I figured that a light, inexpensive tripod would be perfect for me (I really only shoot photos indoors for my blog). I used this tripod for about a month with my Nikon D3100 without any problems. Next thing I knew the bottom extension of one of the legs (the legs extend 2 times) completely detached from where it is locked into place (with the black plastic piece). I attempted to reinsert the leg but was not able to get it to lock into place like it was originally. I used the tripod for a few weeks with the faulty leg, but it just became too much of a headache (the leg would suddenly collapse mid shot, I couldn't get the leg to stay extended, etc).I wish I could return this item for a new one, maybe mine was just faulty? Who knows. Either way I'm buying a new tripod with hopes that it works out better for me."
4,Great for the Price,"This thing is affordable and functional. It is a tad bit flimsy, but it gets the job done. It would work better on a flat, indoor surface than it does outside."
2,Weak on function,"This resembles a number of tripods in the price range. It has nice added feature such as the handle, a hook for center-weighting and swivel feet. However the plastic-on-plastic head does not allow for smooth pans and tilts. It is very jerky, no matter what level of tension you put on it. The worst feature is the quick release mount...the plastic screw head is hard to access and will not tighten down enough to hold the camera steadily in place. Bummer. Oh, and ""carrying case"" is overstated."
1,weak tripod,"I did not know that a tripod could be made as weak and flimsy as this. I can not complain too much as the price was too low to expect anything better. I should have researched this item further, but at the time I was flying through buying gifts. Anyway, the item is not strong enough to hold the Canon Rebel Xs I purchased for my daughter without using a hand for support.."
2,low quality,"I received the tripod and quickly saw that it was not of a very high quality construction. I had concerns of how long the grips that hold the leg extensions would hold up,and I did not like that there is a removable piece that connects the camera to the tripod head. The lock mechanism for that piece also concerned me that it may not hold up over time. I guess the tripod is functional for the price but the value may not hold up if you need to buy a replacement tripod."
5,Affordable tripod,"Happy, happy! Joy, joy! I recently purchased a HDD camcorder and used it to film an event for a friend. I took some good shots from various angles but there are spots where I shook with the camera from movement. I looked around on several sites and the Digital Concepts TR-60N tripod was the best economical choice for me. It is the perfect height for me fully extended and collapses nicely. It is my opinion that this tripod can be used by all, from beginner to pro. Set up and adjustments take seconds. I recommend this tripod to everyone who wants to get a tripod for camera, camcorder, or whatever."
1,Not just inexpensive but CHEAP,"The Tripod arrived. I opened the package, took the tripod out, and one of the legs fell off. Can't use it. I tried to contact the supplier and got no response."
5,Wow! What A Great Tripod!,"I wanted a tripod to shoot topshots for my business, but was a little shocked by the prices. That is, until I saw this baby. It was less than $20 bucks, and I thought I'd take a chance on it, since it also came with it's own case! I was not disappointed when it arrived, and I set about trying all the gizmos. I am spectacularly pleased!"
4,light weight and durable,"I am petite woman, and was looking for some light weight tripod. I can carry this in my backpack and ride bike. Very easy to pull the legs to set as well. overall, I am very satisfied, and would recommend this to anybody who are looking for easy to carry around tripod."
2,"Cheap plastic, and only two way motion","Am not sure if everyone has the same view, but the one that I got from the market place seller - could be moved only in two directions, and the third direction is almost not movable at all.The plastic is cheap material, but thats what we get for the price. However, its unacceptable that the tripod doesnt enable us to move in the direction that it has to.Easy to carry, but only a limited 2-way movement possible."
3,tripod review,"I ordered 2 of these tripods for my son and grandson for Christmas; within 1/2 hr of my grandson attempting to use his, one of the adjustment knobs came off. Also the panhead screw proved too short for his little camcorder, which my son was going to try to fix"
3,light weight,"I was looking for an inexpensive light weight tripod to take on walks - this fits the bill. But it is bit less stable than I would like - a strong wind blows it, and what you have mounted on it, over. Also the movement of the head is a little jerky so it is not that easy to use with a small spotting scope for scanning. With all that said it was only $18 so for the money it is not really fair to compare it to a heavy expensive tripod. I would still buy it again."
4,Surprising Good Tripod at Low Cost,TR-60N has all the features you need at the low cost. I would highly recommend it to value buyers.
3,"Cheap, good.","Let's face it, it's cheap. You get what you pay for. Most of it has a plasticy feel, and when at full height with my Sony DSLR atop, it wobbles. The panning is not smooth and the knobs feel like they would break if you turned them too much. If 20 bucks is all you have and you need a tripod, then buy it. If you can spend 20-30 more bucks, then buy a better one."
1,Complete Garbage,"I bought this together with my Nikon D60. I can tell you right off the bat it is a piece of junk and a waste of money. At first I was somewhat impressed and the sturdiness of the body and its build quality seemed decent, but the head is such junk that it does not screw to my DSLR properly and the camera is left slumped and wobbly. Because of this you can not take a simple, straight photo, and feared constantly for my camera. It doesn't even let you adjust the tilt vertically up or down. This is complete junk, worth spending the $20 toward a better tripod."
3,Light and cheap,"Pros: Lite, has good stance, easy to deploy, the snaps hold wellCons: The head is made from cheap hardened PVC plastic. Only good for light cameras. If you use heavy SLR lense, you will have problems shooting different angles. Really NOT ment for frequent adjusting.I owned one of these for 2+ years (bought mine in bhphotovideo.com for $40) A month ago the head knob broke. If you are serious about photography, look for better tripod with quality head."
1,Broken within 1 week,"I anxiously awaited the arrival of this tripod. My grandchildren were coming for a visit, and I was looking forward to taking many photos while they were here. Imagine my disapointment when I took it out of the carry bag, and it was in 9 pieces! The cheap plastic on the pan head was just shattered! It had been stored in a corner of the closet, and I had not touched it since the day it arrived. I opened the bag, and little pieces of broken plastic fell out. I don't have a clue why it would fall apart like that, but don't waste your money on this one."
1,Sending it back,"I am planning on sending this tripod back as soon as I get back home. I bought it right before a trip to Paris, and first set it up while I was out sightseeing. It's nice and light, and easy to carry around, but it doesn't hold the camera tightly enough. I tried shooting a few pictures at night, but the tripod was so wobbly, that they were blurry. Also, when I adjusted the tripod to take a vertical picture, my camera almost fell off the top and onto the ground. It's a cheap piece of junk."
1,Crank handle broke at FIRST turn,"Cheap plastic handle on the crank broke off on less than one turn. Luckily I was inspecting it before mailing it across the country as a gift. Inspection of other parts shows poor assembly, fit & finish and very rough (SHARP) edges. PLEASE put your hard earned money elswhere."
4,Smaller digital cameras..................,This product was not intended for the larger SLR or Digital cameras. The head is plastic and not stable enough to hold the weight of your high dollar cameras. The concept and the Production are correct. This tripod needs to be upgraded to a light weight aluminum to hold the larger SLR and Digital cameras. It works fine on the smaller three through eight mega pixel cameras that are light weight cameras used with the timer and on automatic.
3,Decent tripod,"I'm a novice photographer, and I didn't need much in the way of a tripod, so I opted to get a cheaper one. I should have dropped a little more money on it though because I am not totally happy with this one. There are a few good qualities. It seems fairly sturdy, it has leveling tools and is fairly light weight. However, I tossed out the carrying case the moment I opened the package. It was made with a flimsy material and wouldn't have lasted more than a few weeks. Also, some of the parts are almost impossible to level.For anyone thinking about getting a basic, cheap tripod, I guess you could do worse. But for anyone who depends on their camera work professionally, or even wants to have good level pictures, get something a little more expensive."
3,It's OK for the money,"This is not a professional tripod. It's sturdy enough for casual use, and the price is good for what you get. It's lightweight, easy to use, and the legs extend and lock easily and quickly. I am 5'4"", and the height is sufficient for me. If you're much taller than that, you would have to stoop to see through your viewfinder, but if you're using a shutter cable, it wouldn't be a problem. If I were taking it into rough terrain or using it every day, I'd want something stronger."
1,Waste of money,horrible quality. knobs don't work. had o hold the camera as it would not stay firm in one position. i have to go for another tripod. wasted money on this product.
5,Norman,"Great Product and Great vendor, they responded to my inquiries immediately regarding shipping. I am very pleases with the tripod and the company."
4,Very Pleaseed,"This is a basic, but very good tripod. It should meet the needs of most any family looking for a good product at a very affordable price."
1,Broken On Arrival,"I bought this in anticipation that despite it's cheap price it would do what I expected: Provide a stable, but light base to take pictures from. Unfortunately it was broken when I opened it up, the plastic is of a very cheap quality! Do yourself a favor, spend a little more and get a good quality tripod so that you don't have to take the chance that it will arrive broken, or worse yet, break during use. I wish I would've bought a better one up front and not wasted my time ordering this one."
3,Really decent for 8 bucks!,"Yes, do not put your expensive SLR on this 'pod. It's only for little digital cameras. Otherwise, it does a great job, and, may I stress, it was EIGHT bucks!"
3,"Good tripod, for the price",It works good. It has all the angles and pivots of your standard tripod. Its not as light as you might think though for being so small when folded up. (not ideal for backpacking)It does the job for a lot less money than other tripods. Its good for someone who does not consider themselves a photographer.
4,AWESOME!!!,Ok so this thing is pretty cool. The head unit of the think is excellent for taking vertical and horizontal pictures. Head piece also moves side to side to make shooting a panning shot easy. Great tripod for the price at under $15. The only reason it didnt get the full 5 stars is because the material is a little flimsy but does great for now.
2,You can do better at this price.,"This tripod is barely adequate for holding a small digicam,provided there is no breeze, e.g. so you can be in self-timer shots.Legs are so wobbly that, unlike most tripods,it is more stable with the center post cranked upand bottom leg sections retracted.The pan-tilt is anything but fluid, andthe quick-release is not clamped securely.A Targus or similar available at Walmart is better at this price."
2,Good at first...,"I found this tripod to be great for the price-- at first. However, after about 4 hours of use, one tripod leg broke from the supports while shooting with my Nikon D80! I would recommend this tripod ONLY for the photographer with a light point-n-shoot."
2,TR-60N,This tripod is cheap and that is what you get. It wobbles severly when extended to its full height.
2,Tripod,"My only problem with this is that it is too light weight unless you plan on using it only a couple times a year with a small camera, indoors. I would not recommend this for a heavy camera or when using a large telephoto lens, that might cause balance issues. Great for the price but you get what you pay for."
2,not really worth it.,i only pay around $15 dollars. but i dont recommend this item if you want to shoot a professional home-movie. is too light that with nothing moves too much.
5,nice product,"It's a nice product, solid, lightwight and easy to use.(Yes, as other reviews mentioned, it looks cheap....)I have already taken more than 300 pictures using it, without any issues!"
1,LOUSY LAZY CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"I purchased through Amazon/ BigValueInc. a Digital Concepts TR-60N Camera Tripod with Carrying Case. I felt it was a stellar purchase until the inevitable day the tripod lost a shoe. BigValueInc. was prompt in answering my email request with this response""NO WORRIES - We pride ourselves in selling products with Manufacturer Warranty Coverages for this reason. Sakar recommends you contact them directly after our 15 day return policy. They can be contacted at 1-877-397-8200."" I called Sakar to ask them to mail me a couple of the little shoes only to find out that Sakar can only replace the entire tripod. Sounds good huh but they want me to ship the tripod back. $$$!in shipping cost and wasted time for the want of a shoe pad which could be mailed with a single postage stamp!!! I need my tripod. I am the official videographer for my son's High School Band. I don't have the time or money for this!!! With customer service like this they'll go broke!!!"
1,You get what you pay for :(,"My tripod came today. I am not happy with it. But then again, you get what you pay for.Pros:- Nice handle on main stem for easy movability- Lightweight- Pivet-ball feetCons:- On the flimsy side- Panning not smooth- I don't feel comfortable placing my camera on it!Overall a waste of my money :("
3,"OK for portraits, useless elsewhere","I bought this because of it's cheap cost and I wasn't quite sure how interested I'd be in photography. I've become quite interested, and have found that I definitely need to move on from this.The best thing about this tripod is it's light weight and it's cost. It's also got a lot more adjustability that I expected in something with this price. But I hate it when I'm using it for anything other than portraits. If you extend it vertically, your camera will bounce around like a tennis ball on a car antenna, so you can forget about long exposures. There is no such thing as a minor adjustment on here, no matter how delicately you try to move things, which makes macro photography virtually impossible.I haven't used it for taking panoramic shots, but I expect that it would be decent enough. I've found myself shooting those handheld anyway, but you'd need a tripod for night-time panoramics. That said, this is going on Craigslist, as I'm ready to graduate."
2,Broke with in first four uses.,"Bought it as a gift, had it less than year and rarely used it and it broke. Camera doesn't stay upright."
2,Cheap and Flimsy,"If you have to use your button on the camera to take photos - this is not the tripod for you. It's so flimsy that the weight from my lens causes the whole thing to wobble. When I press the shutter button there is 10x more movement that if I had been holding the camera myself. I had to use my remote. Which was fine for this event, but shouldn't be a requirement. It's cheap and not worth saving an extra 10$ :) get a decent one and enjoy your tripod."
2,Wouldn't trust it with a decent camera...,"After mounting my Canon T3i, I found myself not wanting to let go of my camera while it was on this tripod. All the reviews on amazon made it seem like a decent tripod when really it's not. Nothing about this tripod was satisfactory. The crank to raise/lower the camera mount felt like any real use would cause it to break, the leg clamps felt like they may give at any time, the level showed it was even but the camera was obviously crooked, the camera mounting system was far from secure & the ""bag"" it came in was a few stitches from falling apart.I ended up just giving it the tripod away; I'd rather have no tripod than one that will destroy my gear."
3,"Cheap tripod, decent for photos","I got this tripod when it was on sale just to have something in the back of my car for those occasions you need one. The tripod is cheap, the carrying case is cheap. First impressions when boxing it was the heavy wave of plastic and/or glue smell. Definitely cheaply constructed as well. The tripod is really only good for basic photos with a point a shoot. Definitely wouldn't trust any camera over 1.25lb on this tripod (e.g. DSLRs). It'll stick when panning or tilting so don't expect to take much video on it. That said, it's still usable and it has nice foam grips and a handle in the center and a bubble level as well. Considering it was half the price I'd pay for a similar tripod at Walmart, it's pretty good."
5,Great Little Tripod,I needed a stable base for my digital camera so as to produce some videos for my web site. This product surpassed my expectations. It's very sturdy and the quick release is a great feature. I highly recommend.
4,Good light weight tripod,This tripod works just great with today's small digital cameras. I used them with a large pair of 15x70 binoculars and it does struggle a bit but that is expected with 4-5 pounds of optics. If you're looking for a cheap tripod that has some great features you are not going dissapointed.
4,Considering price... a keeper,"This is not a suitable tripod for anything else more than amateur digital and analog photography and video cameras. The head is not fluid or anything and when you do move it, it gets sticky in the movement.BUT: IT IS VERY LOW COST. IT is quite functional for still pictures. It has two bubble levels, and the base where you attach your camera is detachable, so you can fix you camera into it, and THEN place it in the tripod. Then you can take your camera off the tripod on a hurry if you want to photograph or film something else. That is: you do not have to screw/unscrew the camera into the tripod every time.I use it with my S2 IS canon camera, for normal and infrared still pictures. It provides !"
1,This one turned out to be crap,The handle thread is gone with in one use. I am wondering if there is any warranty on this item.
5,Great tripod for my Galileoscope,"I bought this tripod as a mount for my ""Galileoscope"" ([...]). Works great! Just the right balance of good stability and low weight. Also has enough height extension range to allow both 6'1"" dad and 5' daughter to comfortably use the Galileoscope. I highly recommend this tripod."
3,Great Price - OK Quality,"This tripod is stable enough to hold my Rebel XT, but not tremendously stable. The movement of the legs is semi-fluid and the quick release latch gets stuck sometimes. But hey, it was $20.This will be a good starter tripod to let me know whether or not I want a more expensive unit."
3,Cheap and best,"If you are looking for a simple but elegant one, this is the best product for the price. It's not very sturdy like the expensive one, but serves the purpose for everyday use!"
2,Mediocre Tripod,"Though I shouldn't expect much from a sub-$20 tripod, I am disappointed that this is falling apart after about a year of ownership and only a dozen or so uses. Each of the legs have become loose to the point that they will disconnect from rest of the tripod where they all come together. It's easy enough to put them back in their slots, but I'm not satisfied to do this every time I want to shoot or move the tripod to a new location. I am now in the market for a new tripod with a more solid build quality."
3,the price was right,"tripod is constructed mostly of plastic and is flexible where you wish it wasn't, but it is a usable and well designed ultralight accessory. If used cautiously it could last for some time. Not for the professional of course, wouldn't stand up to the rigors of daily use."
2,Better to spend more money than to buy this,"This is not a bad tripod if you just need it for fun. If you are serious about your work, either film, or photography, you need something with a more stable base. Also the part where the camera goes into does not grab the camera well. I would, personally, recommend to buy something a little more expensive but that works well. Good thing: very light, so you can carry it with you anywhere."
4,Good enough for me.,"OK, it is a bit flimsy and cheap looking, but that's what you get for under $20 (and eligible for free shipping!), and that's exactly what I wanted. I'm a beginner, so am not prepared to pay for something I don't quite need yet, and may never need.It's light, extends to 57"", has a hook for a bag at the bottom to give it extra stability if needed, has 2 spirit levels, quick release lever, handle, soft sponge bits on the legs (not quite sure what the point is of those, but it feels nice), and has 3 way turning at the top. Also has movable feet for good traction. All for under $20.Not used it for anything heavy duty yet, but so far so good."
3,Tripod,"This was a present that I didn't even see. It was sent directly to my friend. She loves it and thanks me everytime she sees me. So, I would say that it's great."
1,Very Cheap Materials,"This tripod is made of very cheap materials. Feels like its going to break any minute. Plastic is super cheap. Everything moves, even when ""locked"" in place."
2,Look for something else,"I bought this knowing all to well that given the low price it may not last long but within a month one of the locking screws fell off and seemed to have lost thread. I used the tripod less than 5 times before it fell. Last week another part fell off. Even as a beginner tripod I would not recommend it, look elsewhere."
3,It's ok for the price.,"Flimsy, cheap, not the most stable of tripods but it's cheap and it works with some minor alterations. Great for indoor use, not so much when outdoors."
1,TOTAL TRASH,"This is by far the worst tripod I've ever seen! Upon opening it and taking it out of the box, you can clearly see it's made by the cheapest lightest plastic, I extended one of the legs and the pieces broke right off instantly. I immediately returned it, it reminded me of plastic found in a Happy Meal toy, but crappier. Yes it's cheap but it's not worth paying this price for trash when a few more bucks can get you a better one. Hated this thing so much! Every part was skimped on quality, not even the screw for the camera mount was metal, it was plastic."
2,Digital concepts TR-60N,"Even thought the price is tempting, this is a very ""cheesy"" tripod, which with even a little pressure on the capture button, made the whole assembly move. Not very impressed."
3,It's OK...,If I were to do this over.I would probably spring the extra $$ for a better quality tripod.But this is cheap enough and serves it purpose for now.Def. not for someone doing something professionally.But serves it purpose for the few times you need a tripod.
1,Don't buy it!!,Very cheaply made. Two pieces of the tripod were broken within an hour of use. Spend the money and get a better quality tripod.
2,Cheap plastic +++ ROUGH MOVEMENT,"Look, if you just want something to hold up your camera this will probably do it. If you want to do anything else, like actually angle the camera up and down, this tripod is a POS. It is also made of a cheap plastic and one of mine broke as it was shipped to me."
2,Oily substance leaking at head of tripod,"When we opened the tripod, an oily substance was leaking out around the head of the tripod. I plan on requesting a refund this week."
2,Only good for small cameras,"Like many reviewers, I bought this tripod because of the price. You get what you pay for. Overall, the tripod wasn't horrible for ~$20. But, the materially was cheap, the stability of the tripod was questionable, and, perhaps most disappointing of all, it wouldn't hold my dSLR in place in a vertical position. While my Nikon dSLR wouldn't ""fall of"" the tripod, it would pivot around the screw rather than stay in a locked position. In short, it's not a product I was comfortable putting a $600 camera on. If you're buying this as a tripod for a smaller size point-and-shoot camera, it'll be fine, but if you want any real use of a tripod, this isn't a good buy."
2,You get what you pay for with this tripod.Yet good deal,I didnt expect much from this tripod despite the reviews at the 17 dollar price tag . I tend find that peoples five star reviews are on this site are mostly nonsense misleading when it comes to technical gear . Be forewarned this tripod is some what wobbly and has cheap construction.You will have to use it were wind isnt blowing too hard or dont extend the center when it is as it tends be the part that wants to move. the extending column in the apex of the tripod is metal with a run of plastic teeth to do the extending work also which is kinda cheap. For 17 bucks you cant really complain .I would have bought it again for the price tag.
4,Cheapskate Gear,"My primary use is for hunting, so I wanted somthing that can get beaten and broken without hurting my wallet."
3,does the job,Althought i wish i could afford a very sturdy tripod this one does just fine. I do feel like these things should be made of stronger material but then itd just be too heavy. Overall its light weight and affordable. Just dont get wreckless with it and you should be fine.
5,Bang for Buck,This has a ton of features and at the price it has a ton of features. the level isn't the best mainly the location affects this. the handle and hook on the bottom are nice. it is incredibly light and i can throw it on a strap on my backpack and its like its not even there. its hard to dial in some of the tilt but that is totally okay. you have to set up your shots ahead of time and if you want to be quick then splurge 90 bucks and get some fancy photography gadget to fix the problem. well worth the buy don't waste ur money on more expensive stuff unless you are already bringing in money just from photography.
2,broke the first night it arrived,this flimsy thing broke when i tried to pull out one of its legs the first night it arrived. I swear to god I didn't use much strength - I was very careful. The head panning and the vertical leverage is not smooth at all. I don't wanna bother to return this cheap thing. You'd better look for a stronger one for just 20$ more!
4,Cant complain for the price,This is a good tripod for the price we paid. This is not for anything professional but does fine for our holiday recordings. It is definitely cheaply made but as long as you are not rough on your things then it is just fine. We have owned for over a year and a half with no problems.
4,Great value,"This tripod has many of the desired features associated with more expensive tripods at a fraction of the cost. This is not a heavy duty product but for the money it provides everything you need if you have a camera under 2 lbs. This covers a lot of new digital cameras.I've used this tripod with Canon SD 1200, Canon G 10, Canon G 5 and a Canon Rebel. I found that the G-5 and the Rebel may have exceeded the capacity of this tripod to provide a stable platform. However the other camera models, the SD 1200 & G10, when tested in macro and telephoto formats were greatly enhanced by this tripod.I plan on purchasing another tripod to always have one in the car."
1,Digital concepts TR-60N camera tripod,"Over all, it is a cheap tripod no matter the way it looks or the build quality. Hate the strong paint smell. If you are looking at the price, there are many other options. Or paying few dollars more to get a better one."
5,Great for the price.,Just what you need if you move a lot when taking pictures.Great for those goup shots when you want get in the last second.
1,tri pod,This item is so cheap that screw fail off when I used it the first time and it doens't stay still
5,satisfied,"it's compact and lightweight. and good for the money, so if that's what you're looking for, go for it. if you're super serious about all your camera work, then maybe someone a little more heavy duty would be better, but for the average family uses, this is good."
4,"can`t expect more for the price, but is fragile","with this tripod everithing is fine, so far, it works perfect for my light superzoom camera, but eventualy I`ll upgrade do a DSLR so I dont whink any heavy camera can be trusted to this tripod. I repeat, I`m happy with my tripod, but for a heavy camera I`ll buy an all metal tripod."
4,awesome for it's price,"it's really an almost perfect tripod, the only thing is that the plastic adjusters seems a little cheap material, so be really carefull not to break it, otherwise, and as said, it's an awesome tripod. I would recommend it to friends"
2,Tripod,I found it to be rather flimsy and the fluid pan head is anyting but. It binds if you want to do anything but move from side to side. But for the price it's not too bad. Just don't expect too much if you order it. The two levels are a nice touch though.
3,Cheap Plastic,"This product feels extremely cheap and as if its going to break in my hands. I was worried the entire time my T2i was on it. The plastic pieces feel like their going to snap and the locks for the tripod legs bend in weird ways. I have only used this tripod once and I must admit it stood just fine one a level surface for still shots. However, i do quite a bit of filming with my T2i and I'm worried that the panning on this tripod will be choppy. Its not extremely fluid it its movements and doesn't handle the way i would imagine. On the flip-side, this tripod is under $20 so i assume this fits into the category of you get what you pay for. In which case i give this tripod a 3 out of 5."
2,Afraid my camera is going to fall off,"I got this tripod last week after my old one broke (silly me stepped on it after my Daughter left it on the floor, my mistake). Out of the box I thought this was an awesome product. Looked stable, liked the carrying handle, liked all the levels on it. My old tripod didn't have all these frills. Well last night I decided to try it out to take pictures of my Christmas tree. I had it nice and tight, but when I went to take pictures the connection to the camera and tripod kept on coming loose my camera looked as if it could fall at any moment. I took it off, got it all tight again and put it back on the tripod.I would not recommend this tripod to anyone. If it was not for the prime shipping I would have just got my tripod off of ebay for $10 like I did before. I never had fears my camera was going to fall off with that tripod."
4,"So far, so good","I had bought this product for my roommate, to go with a binocular adapter also purchased from amazon. Our primary use for this tripod was star gazing with his Celestron SkyMaster 15x70, which is a pretty hefty binocular. At first, it appeared the tripod was a bit loose, but after tweaking with the knobs, it remains sturdy and we are able to view through the binoculars without any shaking. I do admire the pivoting feet on the tripod, definitely helps with uneven surfaces. The only con is the make up of the crank that brings the height up and down, it appears to be a cheap plastic mechanism, but after a couple weeks use, we haven't noticed any wear and tear. If you are planning to use a regular DSLR or a light camcorder, this tripod is perfect. And especially with the price, this is a great start tripod."
3,Broken On Arrival,"Well i got this thing opened the box and broke pieces fell out on the floor the crank for raising and lowering was broken the box was not damaged so i guess the factory did it when packing it.this thing is made cheap looks cheap and so was the price atleast the shipping was free ,you get what you pay for Its not worth sending back so a little african enginuity will fix it.."
5,Camera Tripod,"This is a tripod that I got for one of my strobes. Because it is small and I can adjust the legs almost closed so that I can get it in back of a table, etc. It works perfectly for me. I have a number of them for my real estate photography."
2,You get what you pay for,This will break on you- just a question of when. For me it was less then 2 weeks. I used it twice.
4,Great item for the money,"I'm just starting out in photography and this little tripod fits all my needs. It is very light and the components are plastic in many places, but the price should indicate that to the savvy buyer.I think it is a pretty good deal for those starting out."
4,Good item for the price,"I bought this item because I needed to stand for my canon rebel camera to take my son's pictures. My first impression was wow, this has all three knobs to control three height options. Three bubble levelers for levelling the camera. Great item. Good buy for the price if you get free shipping."
3,Ideal for the casual photographer.,You really can not go wrong. Its a good tripod for dollar that it asks.
2,tripod,"As soon as I figure out how to extend it to 57"" I will like it better. No instructions come with this item. It is made very well and is very secure even on uneven footing."
4,awesome tripod,"3 of us on an art club bought this tripod coz its like $10 plus shippin, a tripod less than $20 , how could u go wrong with that, yeah its kinda flimsy and made out of plastic , but if u treat it gently it would take you to the roughest shooting location and be able to utilize it.....and for those peeps who broke some part of it , one of my buddy did too, because he havent use a tripod before, so he forgot to loosen up some parts of it , before rotating whatever.....i recommend this product, but once again operate it gently, cause its made of plastic......"
4,"Works Well, good bang for the buck",I used this tripod quite a bit when I went for my vacation. Its not as robust as I want it to be but it does its job well. If you want to start with something cheap this is it.
4,Good and lightweight Tripod,"It is certainly a good and lightweight easy to handle tripod. Knobs and swivel works good. Tripod is good as mentioned.After practical experience with this tripod I thought I need more height than this 57"" tripod."
2,pretty flimsy,"This tripod should never be purchased by serious photographers. The legs can be pushed in though ""locked"" in place and the head which the camera sits on wobbles. It works better than hand holding, but not a whole lot. Please look elsewhere. Spend a few extra bucks and get a real tripod."
1,"Very cheap tripod, DON'T buy it!","The head is too loose to hold my Canon Rebel XT firm. When I tried to tighten the handle, the plastic head broke into 2 pieces. And this is my very FIRST use of this tripod!"
5,tri pod,"This was a gift for my daughter, she especially liked how light weight, easy to use, and the ability to weight it down."
2,Get what you pay for,"When I got this one of the nobs was broken off. It was the one that controls if the camera is horizontal or vertical, so it didn't matter much. But there should be a level on that piece because if you move it, the level below on the stands means nothing. It's definitely cheap materials, and needs to be ""broken in"" to properly move. Still panning can be jerky, and isn't exactly what I hoped for. But I paid $12 shipping included so I guess I can't complain. When I finally got it set up where I wanted it, it worked as advertised I guess because I was able to take some good pictures"
2,Good features but poor quality,"Good: For the cost, the tripod has a lot of different features that come handy. One I liked that my previous tripod did not have was the camera base has click-on mechanism, which allows you to perform one hand operation of placing the camera on the tripod.Bad: The plastic molded parts were clearly not finished. There was plastic sticking out at various places. The screw that fixes the camera to the base which is typically metal has a plastic top that looks like it is going to break off.Ugly: 3 days in my use of the tripod, a tiny screw fell of from the tripod and one of the legs completely detached from the tripod. Because of the way the screw was positioned, I could not even use a regular screw driver to put it back in. I had to fashion a small ""L"" shaped screw driver just to screw it back on. I would not recommend this product."
1,Breaks very easily,"I bought this tripod from amazon and it worked well for almost 3 months. But suddenly, one of the screws came off and it does not go back in. Turns out the threading is broken. I have not even used it for 10 times properly and it broke.Very disappointed."
2,At least its cheap....,"I guess I was stupid to expect much for $15. But this tripod sucks, its pretty unstable, has a tendency to just drop the camera spontaneously and cant level with the ground unless you hold it. Next time, Ill be getting something of better quality."
2,"I Couldn't Get Beyond Set-up,","I bought this tripod over 1 year ago & this is the first time I've tried to use it. I say ""tried"" because I couldn't figure out how to move the platform that supports the camera to lift in a horizontal position, so I broke it. This is my first experience with a tripod, so it would have been nice to have some sort of instruction. A little frustrating."
4,CAUTION WITH HEAVY LENS,"Good quality, but tends to let the camera drift down with a heavy lens on it, regardless of how much you tighten it down. Overall very happy with it."
4,VERY NICE,"Its very sturdy. Not as tall as i thought it would be, but still is very nice. And heavy so it does not seem cheap-even comes with a little bag"
3,"Crappy, But Good For The Money","This tripod is good for the money, but crappy! it fell apart within a month, its useable, but small, and crappy."
3,Affordable and decent tripod,"It sure isn't the most sturdy and or finely crafted tripod- it's made of super light gauge AL and ultra cheap plastic polymer.. but the bottom line is it works. If you need a tripod to ""just work""- look no further. It has three levels of height adjustment, and up top has tilt, rotate and swivel. Just wish the joints were a bit sturdier!"
5,Works great with a chronograph,"I bought this tripod to use with a chronograph used to measure bullet and other projectile speeds. I extend only the the upper and most robust legs and use the telescoping neck to get the chrono to height. The chrono weighs about 2 lbs and is not well balanced. Even with this balance issue this tripod holds it great. It may be a bit gracile if one wants to use it with a manual shutter release but with care it should work well. At $18.80 in March 2012 this is a a pretty low cost so it probably is best suited to the casual photographer. If you have a $5,000 camera a $20 tripod may not be your best choice. Its carrying case, light weight and handle are a plus.Hey, give it a shot."
2,"Very low quality, only buy if you are low on $$$","When I took it out of the box an entire leg fell off. The single screw that held it in had somehow decided it hated this low quality tripod. I think you could buy a worse tripod if you tried hard, but I suggest throwing down 10 more bucks for a brand name device. After all, you are putting electronics that cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars on it, you should invest at least a little in a tripod that works. I sent mine back and bought a canon tripod for 40 bucks."
2,cheap,"This tripod is inexpensive because it is cheap. 1 latch failed after a week, 2 weeks later a leg fell out and another latch failed. It wobbles/shakes and generally just plain sucks. On a positive note, my camera has never fallen off of it and the tripod itself had never exploded or tried to assault me in any way. It's inexpensive and worked reasonably well for a week, now I keep it to remind me of my own mortality."
4,Etra Length,I loved the price and the tripod is great for all my projects. I say take your time and learn to work all the different positions and this tri-pod will pay for itself over n over again Top Notch!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Good value,"This product does what is supposed to do but will not last forever. For the price is perfect, though."
1,Don't waste your money.,Do not waste your money on this poor quality product. The color is totally off. People are blue. General quality is poor. On all three tapes. We checked everything to make sure it wasn't our equipment. It wasn't. I bought one for myself and one for my grandson who was leaving for college and loves all things Monty Python. I didn't give it to him. It's a mess. I'm giving it one star only because you can't give none.
3,Review of John Clese Comedy Collection,"I have only watched the first segment of the DVD, but so far, it is not as funny as I expected. Maybe the last two segments will live up to Mr. Cleese's reputation."
3,A respected analogue recording,"It seems odd to describe a recording as 'historical' when it only dates from 1970, but in the performance of baroque music 30 years is a long time. Back then Harnoncourt's approach was revolutionary - using instruments and playing techniques Bach would have recognised rather than the romantic/classical Victorian performance practices which had been the rule prior. Harnoncourt's performance still stands but has in some respects - clarity, tempo - been eclipsed by more recent recordings such as those by Herreweghe (Harmonia Mundi) and Gardiner (Archiv). Another take on the St. Matthew Passion which takes the Harnoncourt 'authentic' agenda full circle is Spering's reconstruction of the original 1841 rediscovery performance by Mendelssohn in Leipzig (Opus 111). But this almost a different piece of music."
1,"Another book about Joe Flynn and the ""little woman""...","UGH!! I have read every mystery in this series so far. I keep reading them because I love the setting, etc, and try my best to ignore the lead character. But I can do it no longer. The Bed and Breakfast series makes me feel like I am reading about the Betty Crocker 1950's. Judith's prizewinning husband is truly a jackass, and she simpers and caters to him like a spineless idiot. What good old Joe needs is a boot out the door. Maybe then Judith could be the independant character she showed the potential of being in the first book of the series. Ane Renie! Oh please! If I read one more time about how Bill had to have his dinner on time every day....if he's so worried about it, let him cook it himself! I just hope that the much better Alpine series by the same author never becomes this disgusting."
2,pretty awful,"I usually enjoy Mary Daheim's books. They are improbable but entertaining. This one is beyond the pale. Judith intrudes on a police investigation without reason or invitation. She invites the woman who stole her fiance, leaving her pregnant and with no alternative than the awful Dan, and that's just the beginning. I lost all sympathy for the doormat, and her investigations annoyed me. I ended up giving the book away."
2,A mediocre mystery,"Now here's a mystery with every contemporary cliche imaginable:it's a mystery, with a woman detective, who owns a bed-and-breakfast,likes to cook and has a catering business, is married to a cop,and lives in suburbia. Any ONE of these overworked fads ofcontemporary popular mystery novels would have worked, but all of themtogether--is, well, breathtaking. And there's not much that saves it,either: the plot line is bogged down by all the trickery thatthe author needs in order to weave all the cliches into thebook, and Dalheim's prose is strictly second rate. The best momentsin it belong to the crusty mother of the heroine, a nasty witch who saysexactly what's on her mind, directly and without artifice. Perhaps Daheimwould benefit from a lesson offered by one of her own characters....."
4,Enjoyable Space Opera,"This is quite an enjoyable read. Although set in the far future, this novel contains many of the elements that readers of other Anthony books will recognize; each person (or mutant in this case) has a special talent (sometimes more than one). Our hero's talent is that he is quickly 'forgotten' after you meet him....gone...poof! Right out of your mind. Luckily he is a very moral man\mutant!For better Scifi from Piers Anthony check out Macroscope, or the Cluster Series of books, or his Orn\Ox\Omnivore series."
4,Solid product with terrible instruction,"Pros: The product itself is just as what it described. It's just fit the computer and monitor, and gives you more space on the top to put other accessories. The wheels with brake make it easy to move to other place. The quality is good up to now.Cons: The instruction is extremely unreadable. Only one page of paper with few words, and all the pictures are not photo or drawn by computer, but more likely to drawn manually (you can find that the width of the line is not consistent). The marks on the figures are not clear and the all the details are lost. You may even hard to guess which one is the upside of certain parts from that instruction.I think the manufactory should redesign the instruction."
4,Just crazy color schemes,"We're still not sure how effective Sea Bands in general are on my wife who has motion sickness. My reason for bringing it down a point is that I'm not even convinced that the ""child size"" is any smaller than the standard, as we have a pair of each now hoping that the child ones would be smaller and more effective on my wife's tiny wrists.FYI - you don't get to choose the colors, we got camouflage =\"
3,I'm glad I bought this product,"Only reason for three stars is fact, that by doctors charts my son (3 1/2yrs old) is average sized preschooler these bracelet felt a bit too tight. I understand they are used to ""Pressure the point"" but even after 30 minutes my son has had quiet deep marks on his wrists from wearing them, so you really should take them off right away when you reach your destination. But with them and pops (especially made for motion sickness) he's enjoying car rides once again. Purchase was worth it."
2,Did not work for my child,"I bought these for my 7 year old daughter who suffers from motion sickness during long car trips. Dramamine doesn't work for her (it actually makes the nausea worse). I used the adult size bands myself on a cruise and they worked well, so I thought we would give them a try. The first time I went to CVS and an employee helped me locate them. She told me the adult size bands would work on my daughter and the packaging stated it was for all ages. But, just as I thought, the bands were not snug enough on her little wrists, so they didn't work. I ordered the child size and they fit her perfectly to apply enough pressure to her wrists. But...she still complains of nausea while wearing them. The instructions state you can press on the little ""knobbie thing"" to apply more pressure if you experience increased nausea, but this didn't help her either.I'm sure they will help some children, just not mine."
3,Seller should offer color choice,"I received camouflage-print bands. I doubt my daughter will want to wear them on our upcoming cruise, so I may go through the hassle of returning. Pink would be perfect. Those offered with color choice are much higher priced without free shipping, but based on prior reviews this is a common complaint. Two recent reviewers said these are the exact same as adults. This is not the case with the ones I received. I also ordered the same item for adults, and these are clearly smaller. I'll probably just give her my pair if needed, as the adult size may still be helpful although looser."
3,Misleading product,"Don't be mislead by the fact that the product is called ""for children."" It's the exact same thing as the adult seabands. The only difference with the children one is that it comes in fun colors (in my case camouflage). So if the price is lower for the seabands then get the regular ones. As to the product itself, it seems to help my son with his car sickness. When he gets nauseous he'll put these on and typically feel better in 15 minutes or so."
4,Success!,"The sea bands worked well for my carsick 7 year old. They are comfortable for hours of wear. She can put them on all by herself and get them placed easily enough. I would recommend them for anyone who hears ""Mom! My tummy hurts!"" from the backseat every time they get further than five minutes down the road."
3,uncomfortable,"I bought these for my 3 1/2 year old who tends to get very car sick. They seem to work all right however, they are very tight and have a hard little nub that is supposed to go over their pressure point. After about an hour of wearing these my daughter was very uncomfortable and demanded to take them off. They cant work if the child won't wear them."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"After reading all the reviews I was so excited about trying these for my son who is 2.9 years old. Unfortunately, he got sick going and returning and we were very disappointed.I also read on another site that a pediatrician did not think these bands were very effective and I guess she is right.Now we are back to square one and will be talking to our pediatrician about dramamine. :("
1,Express Shipping: $20 for 10 days!,"Who knows if this product works, it arrived too late for the trip it was ordered for. I paid $20 shipping (the item itself costs less than $6!!), ordered on 7/8, it was shipped 4 days later on 7/12 and didn't arrive until 7/22. I have complained to the shipper, no response. I followed up on my complaint 5 days later, still no response. I complained to Amazon over a week ago, still no response. I will never order from this company again. I just want a full refund, they can have the Sea Band back - it's never been opened."
4,Feeling better,So far so good. We have had the bands now for a few weeks and the episodes of motion sickness in the car for my 5 year old are mostly gone. We have a long car trip planned for next week so that will be the real test. He likes them. They came quickly too. Wish you could specific girl or boy but we lucked out and got orange ones.
2,"Disappointed, But Not For The Reason You May Think","I ordered this for my 9-year-old grandson who has a lot of trouble with motion sickness. I can't really say yet how well it works because I just opened the package. I'm writing now because I'm unhappy with what I received. They won't let you choose a color, so I assumed they would surely send a gender-neutral color. Was I ever shocked when I opened the package to find PINK bands. My grandson is at the age where he is anti-girls and anti-pink. I wonder if I'll even be able to get him to wear this. I'm tempted to return it. How much trouble could it really be to allow your customers to choose a color??Update: I am returning the bands today. Just as I suspected, my grandson would not entertain the notion of wearing pink wrist bands. I wish they would replace them with a more appropriate color because I would certainly like to find out if they really work."
5,Great item!,"Finally! Kid-sized Sea Bands! and they come in great colors, besides! Didn't have a choice of patterns, but it came in camo pink and it is for a girl, so worked out! She loves it!"
3,Love Sea Bands,"I always use Sea Bands because I have gotten car sick ever since I was little. I bought these for my son who also gets car sick. We haven't used these yet, so hopefully they work. I just wanted to warn you that they don't offer you to chose a color. I have a son and of course got the Sea Bands in pink :("
2,"Late, wrong color.....big mistake.","This company took WAY too long to ship, even Amazon contacted us thinking it wasn't going to come and then when it finally arrived instead of Orange/yellow we got Pink camaflouge! What boy would wear that? Never again! The item itself is fine it's the company we purchased it from that is the problem."
1,Find another book on the subject,"I would like to begin this review by saying that I am not a fan of the tobacco industry. What I am a fan of, however, are well researched subjects.Mr. Fahs does not offer a bibliography or footnotes in his book. I can not take such a book seriously."
4,Worked fine for my 06 GTO,Although this harness is listed as a Volkswagon part it worked perfectly for my 06 GTO. Nothing fancy but gets the job done.
4,Worked.,Only complaint was that the wires for battery power and ignition power wires were swapped for my car. So when I turned my car off it killed power to the unit. Just had to pull everything out and resolder those 2 wires. Besides that unit worked great.
5,BE CAREFUL,I wanted to just insert the new stereo but that didn't happen. It caused a feedback loop because all of the wires went to the amp which houses the crossovers. Great quality product but please know what you are doing. I had to use the harness for the power and to utilize the existing speaker wires. (I took out the door speakers but used the factory wires going to them.)
1,ALWAYS CHECK,"When I ordered this, it was on a compatibility chart as working for my car, a Mercedes.When it arrive, I checked the pinning and it IS NOT.So BUYER BE WARE!!!!I purchased the CORRECT one from ANOTHER vendor."
3,Little X and the NOI,"A sneak peek at the Nation of Islam, the Washington, DC version, through the eyes of little Sonsyrea X. The author paints a vivid picture of her world as a child growing up in the Nation with all of its restrictions and structure. With all of the rumors surrounding Elijah Muhammad, the NOI changes following his death, and Sonsyrea's mother's move toward Orthodox Islam, it's no wonder the inklings of her departure from the religion arise in the end. I enjoyed this much more than her second book, Do Me Twice."
5,Beyond what the Nation wants us to know...,"Fantastic. I study religion, and this book provided fascinating new insight into a movement that has changed and gone through many hands. I learned a lot, and chnaged my point of view as a result...I guess that the number one thing that I learned was that all people just want an identity...and Elijah Muhammad provided that African American with that. There are a lot of interesting facts that one can glean from this book."
3,listing's b-sides differ from pictured's b-sides,"[out of the 5 total b-sides, i have only heard 2 pre-Raise the Pressure songs... i assign (3) stars to the A-side only because Amazon requires a rating to post a ""review"". It's a nice/very-good-if-not-great song, definately not one of the centerpieces of the lp, although obvious 'safe bet single' material. Re: the b-sides, ""For You"" and Raise the Pressure as a whole are of a different aesthetic then pre-RtP Electronic...] To my ears, Raise the Pressure is a quantum leap from previous Electronic releases, and indeed the best album neworder never made! IMHO, it's only surpassed by Power, Corruption and Lies, which in turn is only surpassed by Joy Division's two masterpieces."
1,So-So,"I only thought this book was so-so. There really wasn't much in it that I didn't already know. Mostly it's just a collection of common sense, nothing original in it at all. Plus, as anyone who knows anything about Buddhism knows, the Buddha said nothing about romantic love. So, this book's premise itself is a little tenuous."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this little book. As a student of Buddhism, it left me bored and wanting much more. Sorry, but I just don't like it!"
3,A Work in Progress,"I have not read this book as yet, however, I have been referred to it many a time but several friends who have read it and all say it is superb."
5,"Best relationship book, EVER!!!","This book is excellent--I couldn't put it down. I felt such gratitude for the author throughout the entire process of reading it. She shares great insights and practical exercises. This book is wonderful for people not only looking for a relationship, but people already in one. It helps a person define what is important to them and changes that may need to be made on the path to spiritual fulfillment. It is not particularly religious, but does give an excellent description of Buddhism in the beginning of the book. It is very spiritual. We are spiritual beings, shouldn't our relationships feed our spirits and encourage growth on a spiritual path? I highly recommend this book!"
4,Excellent book,"This is a great book for someone interested in developing an ""intimate partnership"". Seeing the truth is difficult in close relationships, as we often deny the things we see in the name of ""love"". Dr. Kasl encourages us to seek the truth in our relationships, and in that way they continue to mature (or fade away naturally with as little pain as possible).I hope to practice dating like the Buddha myself someday!"
5,Forget the Rules! This is the One You Need.,"The great thing about this book is that it doesn't get caught up in the whole male/female dating trap rules muck that clog the market. It asks you to be honest with yourself and others and to treat others with genuine love and compassion, which is something that is needed when it comes to male/female, straight/gay relations or any human relations when it comes down to it."
4,nice,"Good book - most of it is common sense in the day to day dealing with folk in general. But then, common sense tends to be the kind easiest forgotten, so its a nice little reminder."
2,disappointing,"Rather than a clear buddhist take on relationships, this book is a melange of pop psychology, superficial ideas of buddhism, and other spiritual approaches (sufism, quakerism). The author is of course entitled to her personal path, but it seems a misrepresentation to use the buddha's name to sell her own brand of advice."
2,It ...[stinks].,"This is a nicey nice book with very little new to say. Just be yourself in a relationship and take it slow. That's about it. She then goes on describing Tonglin Meditation: think nice thoughts and your mental vibrations will change the world. Uh, I don't think so. The only good thing about this book is she turned me on to Quantum Psychology - which I find fascinating. 2 stars."
4,Lessons We all Need,"I bought this for a friend, at the suggestion of another friend, and had to read it first. Dating, married or friends should give it a read and see where their relationships might be improved by reading this book."
4,the kind of book you keep for reference,"a really good book, you read it the first time then go back and re-read sections as they relate to where you are in life."
4,Finding life on a spiritual path,"More than just a handbook for finding love, this book provides wisdom for finding life on a spiritual path. Each bite-sized chapter provides Buddhist-centered but universally-applicable guidance for discovering how to fully love--and live. General Buddhist concepts such as non-attachment, impermanence, acceptance, and living in the moment are gracefully woven into specific guidelines for finding and nurturing relationships. This book helps illuminate how the compass found within each of us can be our best guide for navigating the journey on our spiritual paths."
3,Interesting,"One nice thing about this book is that it doesn't get caught up in the whole male/female dating trap rules muck that clog the market. It asks you to be honest with yourself and others and to treat others with genuine love and compassion, which is something that is needed when it comes to male/female, straight/gay relations or any human relations. On the down side, it's mostly just a collection of common sense - there's nothing really unique in this book. Plus, as anyone who knows anything about Buddhism knows, the Buddha said nothing about romantic love. So, the book's premise itself is a little tenuous. I prefer ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom"" by Taro Gold, which has taught me a great deal about the Buddhist view of life and has indirectly helped my relationships enormously."
4,Soap for your Spirit,"People used to piss me off. In fact, i've avoided dating for so long just because i can't stand any of the women i've met. This book was perfect for me. Not only did it pinpoint my problem as being overly judgemental of my partners but also if revealed that alot of my problem is actually a problem with myself. I think this book was extremely enlightening and serves as an excellent way to awaken the hidden spirit within yourself. Although it touts itself as a book about dating, it is actually about self-discovery and self-acceptance. In an almost backwards approach to dating, Kasl's mantra is: Fix yourself and all the rest will fall into place. Recommendation: Buy the book, enjoy the book, enjoy your life!"

4,good dry bag,"its a dry bag and it does what it says, i would recommend it. just a heads up tho, i saw a week after i bought it that you can buy a 3 pack of 10L dry bags at Walmart for like 15$... so yeah... you may just go buy a 3 pack for the same price... just saying"
1,wouldnt recomend it,"while it shows moves it doesnt go into much detail and honestly, the videos on youtube were worth more than this. The dvd and case looks like a very low budget company made it."
1,Not for Beginners!,"This DVD shows you how to do some of the more complicated moves, even upside-down moves. Not at all a beginners DVD. The two girls in the DVD provide you with bump and grind dances at the end. More grinding than pole moves. Thought it would be a good way to learn a workout. Unless you are experience, don't bother with this one. I need one that teaches me the basics, not how to hang upside-down!"
1,Pole Dance DVD Review,I purchased this dvd with the intentions of learning pole tricks. The video was a disappoint ment because it is really outdated and the pole instructionals aren't very clear. The video just wasn't appealing and it was boring. I plan on reselling.
5,Impressive Work on American Religion,"Dr. Sean McCloud does a great job and service by introducing the reader to the way mainstream magazines from 1955-1993 characterize and portray religions that are not part of mainstream America. This work is organized and presented in a way that is easy to follow, even for those who may be new to the literature. Dr. McCloud's work is a must-read for those who want to know how mainstream journalism in America misinterprets deserving religious groups who are not a part of the mainstream religious movement.I would also like to mention that if given the chance, take one of Dr. McCloud's classes. You won't be disappointed."
5,very good,"I think this is a very good book, but much of this feeling is due to the fact that I wrote it."
4,"Nice, neat henley","Trim and neat, it is 100% cotton, so it'll lose the 'neat' look and get softer, with some wrinkles by the third wash. Nice shirt, comfortable, casual, great to wear to an office baseball game or at your daughter's soccer games.The blue shirt was well-dyed, colorfast."
5,A perfect purchase,"I ordered two of these for my husband for Christmas and they are great. Well made, arrived on time, were the right size and very comfortable. I would order more colors."
2,OK product,This shirt did not hold up well to several uses. This did not meet my quality expectations so I will not be ordering more.
3,Sized small,"The 3x size is the size of a 2x Champion shirt. It's heavy cotton as advertised, but the flawed sizing makes these shirts useless."
3,Order one size larger,My husband loves this shirt as the material is very soft and it's hard to find henley neck shirts. But it looks too small on him.
3,Not My Favorite Shirt,"I'm a bit disappointed with this shirt. I own several other Henleys, and all of them are more comfortable than this one. The neck is particularly stiff. I've washed it several times now, but very little--if any--improvement. Maybe more washings will help."
3,Nice shirt but a couple of sizes smaller than labeled,This is a nice comfy shirt and seems well made but it is quite a bit smaller than indicated. After washing it may be worse.I take an XXL and this was definitely a XL. Just go for the next size up and you will be happy.
5,ONE OF THE BEST COOKBOOKS AROUND!,"There is one huge problem with this cookbook,it is so wonderful, so full of outrageously delcious receipes that the binding just does not hold up to hard use. I want a hard back copy and it simply is not available. If you love to serve elegant delcious fare, then this is one of THE MUST HAVE, MUST USE cookbooks. I am ordering my 4th copy as the others have all fallen apart due to over use. This book will become a dependable ""kitchen friend"". I've even taken to keeping an extra copy on hand to gift to friends. It is a rarity to find a cookbook where every receipe is foolproof, elegant, and delicious."
1,Another one bites the dust,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this book, was yet another dread. The instructions were, at times unclear, and my result was not up to par. Though the pictures are astounding, especially the cover picture, don't let your eyes, or your tastebuds longing for the food, decieve you."
4,"Great sound, stays cool, oversized.","We all know that the Sirius content is outstanding. The SR-H550 is a great unit. The unit doesn't get hot like my pervious unit, the Audiovox SIR-PNP2. The blue display is a nice change from the orange. The audio quality is very good. You can also buy rack ears ($15) for mounting in higher end audio systems. The remote fits the hand well, simple design. The SR-H550 also has game alert for keeping track of your favorite football or hockey team.The power supply should be built into the unit, it is outside the unit on the power cord. The circuit board only takes up about 1/4 of entire unit. The board could be moved forward and the radio could be less deep. If it also came in black, that would be a plus."
3,Ok,"OK, not great. To get a better tuner costs several thousand dollars so I guess it's alright. Sirus compressed audio is only going to sound so good though the Slim Devices Transporter is pretty impressive and should be checked out if you want something truely better."
1,Be Cautious,"I advise you check with your motherboard and chipset and vidocard Customer support before making an expensive purchase like this. Which I didn't, because, according to the described specifications it should work but doesn't. Also ATI customer support said it should work, and suggested endless tweaks to the bios all of which were not helpful. I have had to return this item to Amazon because it was incompatible with my system (a dual Athlon MP board from Tyan.) I am now using a Matrox Parhelia which, although it didn't get the glowing reviews that Quadro boards get, is working well on a dual monitor setup.(unlike my PNY Quadreo board, which lost first one port and then another after only 3 months of use) In all fairness, this may be a terrific board in the proper setup."
4,Economically Price & Well Made,Good wrist braces for the price. Economically priced and constructed well. They fit nicely and do the job. That's all that is needed.
4,Beautiful Indian New Age...,"This CD mybe only seven tracks, but in those seven tracks, Piyali establishes herself as one of the premier Neo-Indian chanteuses out there. From the more traditional sounds to up-to-date synthesizer work, this CD includes it all. Her voice can be frail yet tremendously strong at the same time, which makes taking in her wailing voice over the synthesizer-based tracks even more dilectable. While the lyrics are a bit trite at times, Piyali's voice carries the day, making this a treat for the ears."
5,"Piyali is a beautiful ""Rising Star"".",Piyali's beauty and sensitivity come through in her original songs and music. She takes you beyond the usual in her deeply loving and spiritually aware lyrics. We look forward eagerly to her next CD.
4,I really like this dish.,"It is white and wide enough to hold two sticks of butter. When using the top it is hard to cover if you have two sticks on it without gettting butter on the top; they could have solved this one problem easily by making it a little longer.It also cleans up easy and you can wash it in the dishwasher. I like the top too because it is clear and you can see how much butter you have left. It is sturdier than my old glass butter dish, which is a plus, but still breakable so if you have a toddler like me watch out. It is not a bright bright white but more of a white/ivory. Still, it looks good with my white dishes and serving platters and bowls."
4,A better tool,The design of this spoon seems far more effective than traditional spoons for consuming liquid/solid mixes from a bowl. The higher sides and more acute angle make it easier to get a good mix of ingredients and not end up with most of the liquid remaining when all the solids are gone. I like the ceramic construction both for the weight and its more permanent feel than plastic. Nice capacity for a comfortable mouthful. I would like to have either a longer handle or some downward projection near the end of the handle to prevent having to fish it out of the bowl.
4,Useful and stylish,"Sits up for use as a tiny dipping bowl (but only if you have fairly good dexterity).Hole in handle for hanging.Nice even glazed ceramic.Fairly nice feel of quality when in the hand, but not 100%.If you like miso soup (or udon, or whatever) and you like to avoid plastic, these are great."
4,Like thirty years melted away.....,"I loved Battlestar Galactica. I love the new one as well, with its much harder edge. I have the soundtracks for both, and I find that both of them are excellent bodies of work. The 1978 Galactica Soundtrack, which is what this review covers, is reminiscent of some of the Joh Williams' work in ""Star Wars"" without it being quite as much over the top. (I liked the fact that the newer show used the older show's anthem as the Colonial Anthem in the miniseries pilot). When listening to this, you can almost see the Vipers jumping out of their launch tubes to once again protect the ""rag-tag fleet"" from Cylon attack. The cover art is excellent as well. I owned this in vinyl in 1978, and was glad to see that they made this available on CD."
5,Good soundtrack,"If I was asked who has the best soundtrack,Galactica or Star Wars,it would be a tie.I especially like the track Red Nova on the Galactica soundtrack.I listen to samples of the new Galactica soundtrack and so far so good.There is a question being asked about the rivalry between the two sci-fi epics of Galactica and Star Wars.When it comes to the music,both are good.Now if George Lucas could come up with better material of what he used in the Phantom Menance and Attack of the Clones and The space battles between the Colinial Empire and the Cylons increases in the future episodes."
3,A Good Start,"A good start to an important tool in the camera bag. This rewinder can save unnecessary wear on your cameras rewind motors but eating just one valuable tape could cost you even more. The load mechanism, although functional, has the ability to misload and either not engage the rewind mechanism or partially load and eat a tape. This unit would benefit significantly from a little more R&D and perhaps $5-$8 increase in price."
1,Bad,"This was a really bad, cheap product, it was eating my mini dv tapes every time, even the construction of the product is really cheap. I had to return it."
1,Soooo!!! Desapointed,"I regret purchase this garbage, the rewind button does 't stay press. I need to be pressing down de button all the time that takes to rewind the tapes, very loud and eats the tape"
1,It's a super tape-eater,This worked perfectly for about 8 rewinds. But once it eats one of your precious tapes you'll probably be as dissapointed as I was. Buyer beware... these rewinders are mostly the same look; but marketed by different companies. They all eat tape.
3,Rewinder works...but...,"I also purchased this item. Amazon is not the direct seller as far as I know. The item came in brand new. I opened it. and there it was something inside that seemed loose....or broken..like a piece of plastic trapped inside...I opened it and in fact that was it...a small piece of black plastic, I dunno where it was originally in...Took it out and reassembled the unit...Then as the other reviewer did I placed a used worthless tape in...and YES...the tape was rewound but ended up being eaten too....the tape was caught in the middle of the thing.....tried again, and again til I figured out how to avoid that to happen...yes, you need to hold down with ur hand the cover so it rolls smoothly....But again...hat you expect from a cheap product?..."
3,Scholarly '70s Baroque revival - but vocally disappointing,"Now that Baroque opera is no longer a novelty, this recording is more of a good study source and historical document than a performance. In 1971 Harnoncourt was one of the few international artists to champion Monteverdi et al; today, although the musical values (original instruments, tempi, continuo realization, etc.) are impeccable, this recording disappoints because the singing is so uneven (the Ulisse, Sven-Olof Eliasson, is a real operatic baritone with a lush, ringing sound; the Penelope, Norma Lerer, sings well but with the limited sound of a church alto; meanwhile, some other major roles are sung very badly indeed). Today, any music school putting on a production of ""Ulisse"" would use Harnoncourt's recording as a scholarly starting point, but would cast the opera with much better voices."
1,It sucks,"Bah!~ Awful! I found it meaningless and stupid! and also, it was dumb! thank you for your time *Curtsy*"
5,Unanswered Prayers,"This movie has a fabulous story. Especially if you have ever wondered about your first love. It is not family oriented by far, But by reading the back of it one should understand that a movie about a relationship is not something you would watch with the family. This movie really makes you think what if?? and maybe the grass isnt always greener on the other side!"
2,boxcar willie bonus dvd,We were disappointed that the bonus dvd wasn't actually on Boxcar Willie as advertised. Would have liked to known that the dvdwas about trains and not about Boxcar Willie.
5,"If you could only buy one book on workaholism, this is it!","This is a frightening look at workaholism (the addiction to adrenaline) and the different forms in which it manifests itself. Dr. Robinson's words will hit home if you are or know a workaholic. The book includes information on how to recognize the symptoms, the disease's affect on partners, children and co-workers as well as descriptions of workaholic company cultures, and why this disease is encouraged instead of treated. The book gives some help on steps towards managing the disease from the Workaholics Anonymous 12 step program and other programs. Like all other addictions, Dr. Robinson points out that there's no easy fix, especially since the workaholic still has to work. But the disease is as life threatening as any other chemical addiction. There are lists of resources offered including programs, books and tapes. Keep this one nearby when you need the facts."
1,Terrible DVD,"The film itself, although not a masterpice, is a very interesting one and genuinely eerie. However, the DVD is so poor that I could hardly appreciate this at all. I understand that the film is over 90 years old, but it had clearly been copied from what looks like a very poor quality videocassette. Kino's releases of the Lumiere brothers' films are of FAR better quality, and they were made nearly 20 years before 'The Student of Prague'! Avoid it, unless you really desperately want to see the film, and even then I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Very Interesting film but terrible transfer by Alpha,"A classic made in 1913 that should have the finest quality in terms of soundtracks and visuals. It looks like the WORST video tranfer ever and the repetitious music (a basic minor progression) is terrible. Think bad Philip Glass.Alpha may have done some great things, but this GEM of early cinema has been sabotaged. Let's pray Criterion hears about this.A crime!"
1,"HORRIBLE Editing - Great Book!, Highly Recommended","This is a great book, and the longest that I have ever read. Ivor's teaching approach, although frustrating and daunting, effectively teaches the language concepts you need to begin programming. You will find yourself adding code to an example and redoing it later and redoing it later... each time learning a tiny bit about design and some about the Java language. The big example (a drawing program called Sketcher) is developed over several chapters and is used to demonstrate all sorts of language features including a good intro into Swing. Even though I feel that this is a fairly solid book that I would recommend, I am only giving it 1 star to bias my vote and communicate a message to Wrox: Hire at least one book editor that has some quality standards. The book is fraught with mistakes (most don't appear in the Errata as of 2/16/06)."
1,... a very poor programming book,"The book is rife of unsound programming practices. On the cover, 'Ivan' tells you how good his style is and how he'll teach you a marketable skill - what he teaches you is how to write second rate scratch.My main gripe is the example code... I personally don't think it's much to expect for all the code in a programming book to be compilable nevermind correct.This is really a disgrace.Do yourself a favor and buy an Oreilly book or just do the turorial on java.sun.com."
5,My favorite chente cd :),Ive been looking for this cd for years literally. When I was little my parents had this on vinyl and I played it over and over. I finally found it and it brings a tear to my eye. If youre a true chente fan you'll love this!
3,Small for blinds,This product is smaller than I thought. I believe that it should have been made bigger especially for blind persons.
1,NOT GOOD,"I just bought this DVD along with two others; Leigh Ann's Advanced Pole Dance Workout and Sedusa Studios Advanced Pole Dancing. This one was by far the worst. The dancer is topless, pierced, and tattooed all over in a lot of the scenes, a man is narrating it, and it keeps skipping from advanced to beginning to advanced to intermediate. It's just not good. Leigh Ann's was must easier to follow and worth the extra cost."
3,Alright quality,Overall quatility is ok. i was expecting something better because my fender gigbag feels a lot better than this. but for $23 i guess is alraight. i bought this just to bring my schecter from florida to california. i aint planning to use the bag outside. It is a padded bag but not that much.
3,too small for a bass or e-guitar,"my bass height is 46 which is standard size, but this one can't fit, dont know why, it is about 44? have to return it , padding is OK."
2,Annoying,"Some writers and directors know how to successfully take the viewer through time, but those people didn't work on this movie. I recognized some vague remnant of a potentially good story, but struggled to follow it. The acting was adequate, but not remarkable. After watching a first time, I had my husband sit down with me for a second try. It didn't get any better.If you're looking for a crisp, clear story that follows a line of action, this isn't it. ""Flashbacks Of A Fool"" made me feel like one for sitting through it twice."
3,flashbacks,"Flashbacks of a Fool with Daniel Craig, was weak in it's storyline. The one thing that made it different was it was looking back from the present. Duh, that is the title! The ending was a surprise other then the ending it was very predictable and a definite R rating for sex, drugs and language. I will watch again, but when I can not say. Try and see the information others have mentioned on this film.Three and half stars."
4,"A pleasant, unexpected surprise","I wanted to watch this movie solely because of Daniel Craig, so I'll admit I was pleasantly surprised to find it had more to offer than just man candy. I became emotionally invested in this movie, and there are elements of it that will stick with me for a while. In particular, I enjoyed the lip-synching sequence, which was unexpected and an interesting addition to an otherwise somber and intensely emotional story. For anyone who's ever felt on top of the world, only to wake up and wonder where you went wrong one day, this film puts that feeling into perspective, while offering a bit of hope that things will get better."
3,"Not a great movie, but...","I will watch almost anything Daniel Craig or Olivia Williams does (and I find Eve to have an amazingly magnetic screen presence). So, while the movie was not particularly deep or involving, spending almost two hours in the company of these wonderful performers was a worthwhile use of my time."
3,The man who has everything,"Actor Joe Scott has everything he ever wanted: fame, fortune, Malibu mansion. Now firmly ensconced on the self destructive cycle of sex, drugs and loneliness, in one terrible day he finds his career in the dumps and learns that his best friend, whom he hasn't seen in decades, has unexpectedly died back home in England. Joe returns for his funeral, and the rest of the movie focuses upon his memories of growing up and realizing how he got this way.It's all been done before, and there's nothing fresh or new in Flashbacks of a Fool. The competent acting and lovely background shots can do little to inject life into it. Even the graphic sex is cold. In the end, it is left unclear as to what direction Joe will take as he returns to California. The 3 stars of my rating are in recognition of its strengths."
2,"Not really bad, but kind of a waste of time","The acting by Daniel Craig is quite good, but he is only in half the film at most. The story just wasn't that compelling and it was depressing at times. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone other than the die hard Daniel Craig lovers out there."
3,Rather Boring,"Flashbacks of a Fool, written and directed by Baillie Walsh, and starring Daniel Craig as the adult Joe Scott and Harry Eden as the young Joe Scott. The performances in this film are rather good; especially the leads, and there is some great cinematography. Sadly; however, though the acting is fine, I felt uninvolved and disinterested in the characters. As other reviewers have stated, the film is a bit disconnected and often disjointed. This is in evidence primarily with regards to the friendship involving Joe and Boots. Their relationship never leads to the feeling that they were very close. Ultimately the movie never compelled or inspired me to care. This is a middle of the road movie that is really not that fun to watch. If you are into slowly paced character films, this movie might be right for you."
3,Still can't feel Craig's feelings,"Unlike most, I find Craig weak as Bond, far too emotionless and lacking the grace and wit of Connery. That makes Craig right for this role, but his Joe Scott never really pulls me in the way he might.Flashbacks is well-made, but I never really felt what I think I was supposed to. Maybe that's my fault, but it still leaves me respecting but not loving this movie, despite its good points.For those looking for a depressing night of cinematic musing on the emptiness of fame, though, this may be right up your alley."
2,Been There Seen That,"This film should be titled Deja Vu of a Fool because I have seen everything before and in better films.Daniel Craig is a burnt out drug out over the hill actor. But when he is informed of the death of his childhood best friend, he flashes back to childhood or his teenhood.Not much of this film is original nor much of it interesting.DVD EXTRAS: Interviews with Cast and Crew (2:30 mins)"
1,"Hedonist, Examine Thyself","I'm sad to report that this ""morality tale"" of a debauched fallen star confronting the emptiness of his life when his childhood friend dies is one of the worst films I've ever seen--pretentious, self-conscious, clumsy, slow paced, not a character that's slightly interesting.The opening shot with a maudlin ballad sounds like a made for TV soundtrack from the 1970s. Attempts at ""ironic dialogue"" fall flat. The soundtrack throughout is amateur and sounds like trite 1980s low-budget (except for the opening, which sounds even older).Cluttered with cardboard characters, a script sodden with trite, self-conscious dialogue, overblown cliche scenes like ocean waves crashing, this film should have never been made.Yes, the self-indulgent, nonexamined life is not worth living. But sadly this film is not worth watching."
2,"Rated a ""real"" R","The idea of the movie was good, I just didn't realize it was rated a real ""R"". My fault. To much skin and sex for my taste. Surely someone has enough intelligence to figure out a way to convey a movie without being so visually pornographic. It is okay for a viewer to use their brain and think instead of just observe. And, it would have been more interesting to know if Joe really got his life in a better place, he was certainly trying at the end."
5,Roxy or Bowie?,"Moving film. The transportive nature of this film is really something. I feel in love with the scene with ""If there's something let me know.""One of Craig more serious and better films."
5,Execellent book,"This book was very easy to use. It was just like vocabulary books you had in middle school. You start off learning things like prefixes, root words, suffixes etc. Then they start putting words together. It will help you understand medical terms when you break them down. The flash cards also help."
3,useless for my class,"already an LPN, and doing an online course for RN at the local community college, i didn't even crack the cover. i did need the code inside. otherwise a waste of money. i would've rather not spent money on this text at all."
3,plastic a bit flimsy,I purchased this reploacement crate pan through Amazon. This was the second replacement pan for our dog's Four Paws crate. We have the largest crate made in their line. Our dog is not wild in his crate at all. I find that the plastic the crate pan is made of chips and cracks fairly quickly. I much prefere the metal crate pans for durability. The plastic cleans fairly well and fits just fine. I am only concerned about the replacement cost which is quite high. Having replaced it once was enough but having to replace it a second time makes that crate quite expensive. Our dog is a 100 pound Labradoodle who generally sits and lies quietly in his crate. The older crates that came with the metal pans were far more durable and I miss them.
4,Great all in one machine,"We use this in a small office and it works great. The price is good for an all in one printer that also has a sheet feeder and ethernet capability. We use this on a network with Mac's and PC's without any printing problems. I do not think scanning across the network will work with the Mac's, but I have no problems scanning to my wirelessly connected laptop accross the network.Note: Some cheap papers tend to jam a lot. If you get a lot of jammed pages try a ream of paper from a different manufacturer."
3,Computer Technician II,"I buy this Printer, this look Great in my office, but Remember this no Bring Toner, I order today, I don't install yet.Box Include for my:Copy of CD DRIVER for Printer in Windows 2k, Xp 32Bit, XP 64Bit, Vista 32Bit & Vista 64Bit.USB Cable.Printer is New."
5,The Trials and Tribulations of Life,"This is an inspiring book of poetry...highly recommended.Thomas Weston, author of Mavis and the Painted Ladies."
1,I rate it lower if i could Y'ALL!!!!!!!!!!!,"I agree with the ""BOO"" guy the graphics are AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PS2 is so much better then Gamecube and has at least 10 better football games then this piece of JUNK!!!! The announcers are annoying and the Games are EXREMELY BORING Y'ALL!!!!! ....PS2 is Better...!! This game is Just AWFUL..... Buy PS2 BUY BLITZ Y'ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...Y'ALL Best not waste your Money on THIS ............Y'ALLLLLL!!!!!!1"
1,This games is WEAK!!!!,"All this game has is graphics, and that's about it. The controls are horrible, and the gameplay is even worse. It kinda felt like I was watching pee-wee football while playing this game. I must say I was highly disappointed with this game,judging by the excellent job EA did with previous years of the Madden series. Trust me save yourself the money and do not rent or buy this game."
1,So What if it Looks Great?,"I paid $6 to rent this game, and even that was a complete waste of money. John Madden annoyingly says the same things after similar plays (so by the second game, you've heard it all), but that's just commentary, that's not that big, right?Well, when I tried to view an instant replay, none of the players showed up, just the ball.When I made a pass, as soon as I threw it, it was called a fumble. I know the rules of football. That was a PASS.The same lame rap song plays during the game and during all menus.The gameplay is aggrevating and was designed poorly for the Gamecube controller.I could go on, but I'm limited here. Its not worth it and it falls way below many of the other great football titles I've played.Avoid this one."
2,Another Madden game without innovation,"If you like this game then pick up Madden '98. It's the same game. Decent running game and pass rushing, but everything else falls flat. Stunning graphics, but they don't save this stale game. EA has gotten complacent with mediocrity over the years, which is why games such as the 2k series have taken the throne for sports games. Do yourself a favor and avoid EA's lackluster sports lineup, especially this one."
1,It really stinks,ive played this game before and it is the worst ive ever seen. do yourself a favor and dont waste your time buying because you will be unsatisfied.
1,Bad as in terrible,"I bought this game for my kids and my husband to play. Its really terrible because the controls are so hard to manage and the game play is just horrible, I think I'll sell it on ebay to get some money back. My husband a fan of the madden series, but not this one. poorly designed."
3,Another great Madden game.,"I bought this game the day it came out for my brand new Gamecube system. It instantly became my favorite game for the system, and I could find absolutely nothing wrong with it.A year later, I buy Madden 2003, and now I realise that this game is not as good as it seemed. The computer is not very smart at all, Screen plays don't work with anything, and the controls feel pretty awkward. If you can get past that, it is a completely solid game that can steal hours from your life."
5,The Best Football Experience Ever!,"The graphics are amazing! The players look,act, and move realisticly. There are even stadium annoucements in the background! The gameplay is easy. I t feels like your coaching your own team!"
1,Game Stinks!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think this game is stupid. 1rst of all the heads are too big, and the graphics are bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not much of an Upgrade,"There is very little different between Madden 2001 and Madden 2002 for the PS2. They've added various game plays such as the 2 Minute Drill (a lot of fun!) and Situation and the animations are improved. (Wide receivers actually catch the ball without spinning around.) The create-a-team feature in franchise mode is fun, but overall there's not a lot different or innovative in this latest edition of the Madden series.That said, it's still the best NFL game available for the PS2, in my opinion. The animations, the gameplay and the franchise mode are unmatched.Overall this is a much better game than NFL 2K2, but I sure wish that EA would quit resting on their laurels."
5,TYR Goggles Case Review,"The product is great, it keeps my goggles from getting scratched. Makes it easier to throw them in a back pack."
4,Just OK,"The case won't win any beauty contests and looks somewhat cheap, but it does the job. I was even able to squeeze in a small bottle of anti-fog drops with my ParMel optical goggles."
2,the price of shipping is the same as the product,"The almond oil is a great light oil for cooking, and is really good when cooking fish. it has a light sweet taste. In addition it is likely to be a healthy oil, as almonds are one of the healthiest nuts. however, this particular product has a shipping cost of around 10 dollars at the time of this review, which is about the same cost as the product. this is obviously too high to be fair."
5,GREAT IDEA & WORKS GREAT!,"THE BLADE DOES NOT WIGGLE-SLIDE AROUND LOOSE OR FALL OFF!RARE EARTH MAGNETS WORK GREAT, I CAN EVEN USE MY OTHER 6 OR 18 INCH STEEL COMBINATION SQUARE BLADES IN THIS TOOL, THEY JUST SLIDE RIGHT INTO THE SLOT AND ATTACH THEMSELVES FIRMLY AGAINST THE BANK OF MAGNETS. YOU MUST SLIDE/PULL THE BLADE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS: FINE ADJUSTMENT ARE EASILY ""PUSHED"" INTO PLACE AND IT HOLDS TIGHT WITH NO SLOP!I CHECKED THE SQUARENESS OF THE 12 INCH BLADE AT 90 DEGREES WITH MY DIGITAL PROTRACTOR AND IT WAS: 90.1 DEGREES WHICH IS ACCURATE FOR MOST CONSTRUCTION NEEDS.I REALLY LIKE NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT BRASS KNOBS COMING LOOSE OR NOT TIGHTENING WELL, AND THE INCLUDED SCRATCH PIN WILL NOT FALL OFF EITHER!NOW THIS IS WORTH THE WAIT TO RECEIVE IN THE MAIL!"
3,"Nice, but I'd rather have it solid","The magnet is pretty good, but upon retrospect I wish I'd gotten an attached angle. It sometimes will pop off if there's too much stress against it or if the angle isn't perfect when you're trying to true a corner."
3,Non-submersible!,"If you submerge this bag for a period of time, water will permeate through and into the bag's interior. This bag only works with guarding well against splashes."
3,Just a little too small for DSLR with lens,I was hoping to use this bag with my Canon 5D MK III on a trip that has wet landings (think rubber raft). The bag is just too small to fit. If it was just a little wider it would have worked.
5,This CD Rules!!,"Craig David id the man! His music is soothing!! He sings like an angel! I ordered this because i wanted a copy of his CD before it was released here in the USA!! I recieved it and it is always in my CD changer!! If you like smooth sounding music, you'll really love him!"
1,Doesn't fit,"This battery is the wrong physical size for the BK200. Don't buy it for that box. Maybe it fits the Bk200B, I don't know."
5,Wonderful Memories,"This is a great book for anyone who loves nostalgia and the way the old parks used to be. For those of us who grew up in the area and who have treasured memories of Kennywood, this is like having a family album around the house."
3,Hobby Horse Takes on a New Meaning,"I tried to like this biography. I honestly tried. However, when the bulk of information about Byron's life is gleaned from the letters of people who hated him (often with good reason)I wonder about the integrity of the author. Ms. Eisler's style is an uneven mixture of purple prose (think of a boddace-ripper written by a humorless grad student), dry academia, and tabloid golly-gee-this-should-have-been-on-the-Springer Show vapidity (if that is a word).Eisler dwells overmuch on Byron's and Hobhouse's alleged homosexuality and misogyny: as if those traits were the only traits that informed friendship, personality, much less, literary ability."
1,"Less Than One Star, But I Can't Put That, Apparently","Please do not buy this book. As an academic whose specialty area is Lord Byron, I urge you to avoid this sensationalist and poorly written work at all costs. It is, aside from anything else, full of small mistakes regarding dates, etc. If you are looking for a reliable recent biography of Byron, buy the Fiona Macarthy book before you buy this one. If you are willing to spend more and hunt more, and don't mind a book that, because of the time when it was written, scants the issue of Byron's complex sexual tastes, the undoubted go-to bio is Leslie Marchand's three volume work from 1957. Old, but still the best."
2,Sensationalism,"Sadly, the recent biographic trend on Byron has been to concentrate more on his sexuality than on the fullness of his life. This follows that trend slavishly, it reaches for sensationalism and fails to reveal the poet. It is a glossy superficial biography that appears thinly researched and accepting of much rumor as fact.Serious students of Byron should avoid and seek out the much more balanced and accurate Marchand biography."
2,Dull as Dirt,"Another book about Byron, I thought when I saw this. Hmm. Have their been new discoveries? Does the author have new interpretations? No, I realized as I read this book. Despite all the juicy details of Byron's erotic adventures, this book is the dullest volume I've picked up in some time. It's the details. They weigh the story down, and it wasn't clear to me why the author thought this book needed to be written at all. She certainly included everything she researched but nothing is new and nothing is fresh in the telling. Byron comes off as despicable and self-absorbed, which is probably ok--no doubt he was horrid--but the author also makes him sound boring, which I bet he wasn't."
5,Biography beautifully & absorbingly written,"Even if you aren't extremely familiar with Byron's works, this book will grab and keep your interest as an absorbing book of history, society and morals. The text flows easily, and the narrative line is never compromised. Eisler has written a book that will last through the ages. I really loved it, and am happy to reccomend it."
4,Spinning Dolphin,I really like this ring! It is comfortable and makes me happy wearing it! The seller is great and I would recommend this seller!
4,Useful,"This dictionary was quite useful to me on a recent trip to Madagascar. It has wonderful sections divided into subject matter such as:""Meeting & Greetings"", ""Eating/Meals"", ""Camping"", ""Typical Travel Interactions"". and other such helpful categories. As this seems to be the only Malagasy dictionary available in the U.S., it definately served its purpose well!"
5,Will buy again!,"So glad I purchased this! I'm a p90x beginner but didnt want to pay for the expensive price for all their products. I have tried beach body's and this taste just the same!! I don't drink mine with water I mix it in a smoothy with cranberry juice, frozen fruit and ice :)"
5,Love the taste!,This is my go to protein especially for post-workout. Mixes easily & it is delicious. The Tropical mango is a great change of pace from the routine taste of vanilla & chocolate. Plus the price & convenience via Amazon cannot be beat.
1,Not a fan of the taste... woah :(,"I ordered this based on lots of positive reviews of the taste for the different flavors. It turns out it is not for me... at all. Compared to something like Isopure, I seriously have an aversion to this, and I am not that picky. (I tried to stay open-minded and tried to like it over several days. I shudder now just thinking of it. In the end it got where I couldn't even swallow it anymore.) Tastes a bit like raspberry milk of magnesia. I know, right? Just wanted to put my two cents out there. If you are thinking of purchasing based on good reviews of the flavor, maybe try to get a sample first.. or order the smallest possible amount. For me this purchase was a HUGE mistake.. but everyone's tastes are different."
3,Not very good.,I don't prefer this to the chocolate and vanilla of other brands. It really doesn't mix well and bubbles up if mixed to much.
2,"Decent flavor, poor quality powder","I ordered this product because I've never been a fan of ""traditional"" whey flavors (vanilla, chocolate, etc). The flavor was ok, but this stuff foams up like a son-of-a-gun! The only way I could keep from nearly having to strain the foam out is to stir it slowly with a spoon in a glass...which defeats the purpose of my portable blender-bottle, or using my full size blender to add in other ingredients.I used it for about a week, then went to a local nutrient store to get something else. There are definitely better products in the same price range."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"This is perhaps the least interesting of the Sandman volumes so far, with each issue a different story of someone affected in one way or another by The Sandman. Even directly, in the case of Orpheus, his son, and his refusal to take any advice from any of The Endless. Stories of Ramadan, Caeasar, and even Lyta Hall's son Daniel being told a story in the House of Secrets."
3,"Good, bad, who knows","Clearly, I expected a little too much from this particular Sandman graphic novel. Flicking through and considering the wildly beautiful artwork for stories like 'Ramadan', I imagined 'Fables and Reflections' to be the serie's finest point.The notion of the work is an excellent one. Nine stories, each completed by different artists and each portraying a historical event with a little Sandman twist.However, the execution of the work leaves a little to be desired. For the most part, the stories are anti-climatic, slow and irrelevent. Perhaps the only pieces that can stand alone are the whimisical 'The Hunt' and the tale of lost love, 'Orpheus'. Elsewhere, there is little of Gaiman's usual originality to be found.'Fables and Reflections' is clearly not a great starting point for delving into The Sandman. I would, however, recommend 'Seasons of Mist', 'Brief lives' and 'The Kindly ones.'"
3,"Myth, History, and Dreams and the story between","I must say that this book was a surprise when I read it. This was the first short story collection of the Sandman series that I encountered and I fell in love with it. It was amazing to see the size of the canvas upon which Gaiman's ultimate work could be laid: here we had his characters encountering the mythical, the historical, and all spaces in between to give us tales that I'll never forget. I really enjoyed this volume of the Sandman, and there's even a little foreshadowing in the story about the first and last Emperor of America story about what is going to soon happen in the actual Sandman continuity. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves Sandman, history and myth, or just a damn good story!"
4,The medium of comic books has finally reached its potential,"The Sandman series is comic books as high literature and high art. Finally, the potential of the medium is being recognized. Historical figures galore make appearences: Augustus Ceaser, Marco Polo, Tom Paine, and more. Plus the best Werewolf story I've ever read."
4,"More views, and different views","What I like about the Sandman is the way it has room for so many different stories to open up. This volume is about the Sandman myth, of course, but connects to other myths from the Arabian, Greek, and Old Testament worlds.The art is varied and enjoyable - P. Craig Russell is reliable as an artist and a visual storyteller. The other artwork complements and contrasts with his delicate style. Some is stark, almost geometric; use of color ranges from subtle to shattering.It's good, varied material. I like the stories, I like the art, and that's enough for me. I'm relatively new to the Sandman, but I'll keep coming back for more."
5,The beauty of Dream,"Neil Gaimon has created a world that we all dream of. Incorporating fact and myth becomes a surprisingly intelligent as well as entertaining story. Don't read just one, start at the start with Preludes and Nocturns. Highly recommended as one of the most beautiful things ever created."
5,Blown Away,"I was okay with the first series of one-offs, Dream Country, but I definetly loved the comple story lines surrounding the 1,2 and 4, so I came into this one with an air of snobery against singles issue collections. But these were so good that this became my favorite collection, even over ""Mist"". The Emporer of America was astounding and the contest's metaphor about the ups and downs of life is a construct that Joseph Campbell would be proud of. His incorporation of history and mythology are at Gaiman's best in this series."
1,Is not possible to read on Kindle app,I bought this book as an ebook for my smartphone. Planning to use the Kindle app. It is not possible to read it with this app as it is not possible to zoom in on the pictures. I have read several of the other in this series but then in paper and loved them. But buying electronically for my phone was a waste of money.
4,All The Bells And Whistles,"I recently got a new computer and discovered to my dismay my cookbook program was not compatable with Windows XP. I subscribe to ""A Taste Of Home"" and when searching for a new program, this one popped up. Installing was a breeze, but I do have a problem with having to keep the CD in the computer. I tried to do the update that I think will solve this problem, but living in the booddocks as I do, my connection speed is not the best (and that is being charitable!) and it is not stable enough to survive a long download. Other than that, the program appears to be quite good. It has taken a while to learn the ins and outs of all the various and sundry applications, but that is me, not the program. I think it might be a bit complicated for a first timer, but that really isn't a negative. Support seems to be first rate, and customer service is very responsive. If you need/want another cookbook program, I highly recommend this one."
3,It's ok,"I had higher hopes for this software. As, I am a huge fan of the Taste of Home Magazine, I expected it to have way more recipes. I did like the fact that there are a lot of options with this software, you can store your own, update, cut or add quantities, I also like the fact that you don't have to keep re-installing the disk everytime you want to use it. So, I am able to share it with my friends."
5,"Love My ""Cook'n"" - Would be lost with out it!",I have used this program for over 6 yrs. It took several months to get all of my recipes in (I'm definately not computer literate) but I managed to figure it out! Now no more hunting for recipes. I can go print a fresh copy. Once all of the recipes were in I actually made a cookbook and gave it as Christmas gifts one year! Since my mother had passed away I included her recipes and my daughters and nieces were thrilled to have this to treasure! I also love the way it figures the nutritional info for each recipe since we follow a low carb diet and have diabetics in the family. It is also easy to add recipes as I find them in magazines or get them from friends. I now am getting ready to print my second cook book with new recipes. This is a great program for this old fashioned cook who is very computer illiterate!!!
1,Cooking 101,"Salt of the earth people trading recipes over the back fence. Crushed soda crackers? Cans and jars and bottles, oh my. This type of cooking reaches the level of most high school students."
3,Harnoncourt and Nero,"Yes, this is a fine recording and performance. I may be a small minority when it comes to fans of 17th century music, but a find myself almost sickened when it comes to recent performances of this magnificent opera. Thankfully, we have the great Glyndebourne performances with a tenor Nero and full orchestra. This opera is not a museum piece, as it has been treated in recent recordings and performances. It is now being ""historically performed"" to death. At least Harnoncourt has (some) blood and guts"
1,Very Low Quality Tripod,"This tripod claims to be 60"", but the tallest it will go with the legs out for stability is 49.5"". I got this tripod because I am simply giving photography a try, and it was inexpensive. I thought I was getting a tripod that would at least be sturdy. I have yet to take a picture with the camera on this where it is not blurry (due to shake). I do not have a remote for my camera, but with the camera mounted to the tripod, I always use the delayed timer, so I am not touching the camera or tripod to take a picture. Even with this technique, the tripod is still shaking after 2 seconds from hitting the button to take a picture. In summary, this tripod is a $20 paperweight."
5,Impressive quality for less than $20.00,"I was not expecting the level of quality I received from this product. I am not a pro, but this will do nicely for most people. I have no complaints.Digital Concepts TR-62N 60"" 3-section Deluxe Tripod with Carrying Case (Folds to 23"")"
2,Disapointment in Vermont,"The plot was weak, as was the main character. Both never developed. The ending had a lot of build up but fell flat. It was frustrating that nothing ever worked out in the entire book, it crushed the reader's hopes again and again."
4,Moonlight in Vermont,The book started out very slow in capturing my attention. As a born and raised Vermonter I knew where the author was talking about when he described the locations. By the middle of the book the author had brought me into the story and it ended leaving you wanting more.
4,Strong analysis of party leadership,"Kelly has produced a most comprehensive account of 1980s Australia, but more than that, he has also dealt with the vital question of leadership in an accurate manner. His analysis of the Hawke-Keating and Howard-Peacock rivalries is the strength of this very worthwhile publication. Anyone who wants to understand the politics, parties and personalities of the '80s should read this book."
1,Disappointing,"The quality of the publication itself was poor. Odd formatting and type size. Uneven quality of writing. Occasionally good insights, but rigor of arguments for feminism was less than I expected. Not sure it brings anything new to the table."
2,A little cheap,This product is in fact a full set of dominos with the colors shown in the picture. What they don't mention is that they are made of really light weight plastic with stickers on them. I found them to be usable but without the weight and proper feel of a normal domino set. Perhaps they are good for really young (or really weak) kids.
3,buyer note,"Note to buyer, I thought I would get adapter ring,filter holder and booklet with this product but I didn't.I only recieved 2 filters, uv filter and polorizer included."
3,good but,liked the book but it became a bit long when gina dove into uncharted territory..also she was wrong n her ohio desriptions of lollapolloza..ohio river never gets near cleveland...or cuyahoga falls for that matter
1,just another nirvana book,Just another post punk book nothing special. If you buy it to read try to buy it used. Gives you the same ol same ol in every other nirvana book.
3,Could have been better but not bad.,"I guess what troubled me most about _Route 666_ was the fact that each of the bands who Ms. Arnold spent an enormous amount of ink, were actually all crossover (mainstream) bands, except, perhaps, Fugazi and the Buthole Surfers (but even they had a fairly big hit with ""Pepper""). There is no question that Nirvana, the Replacements, and Husker Du all started out as Punks. However, to make a blanket statement that these bands lived and died as punks is a gross misunderstanding. This is the story of music which may be considered a trifle left of center. This is not the story of truly punk bands like Flipper, Fear, Black Flag, the Minutemen and Minor Threat although I'm pretty sure she mentions them all. Punk rock is and always was underground. That being said, I think Ms. Arnold does a pretty good job of telling the story as she saw it unfold."
3,"nirvana,fugazi and a healthy dose of grateful dead bashing","I don't know quite what to say about this book. I found it entertaining,and it's nice to see someone out there is as daft about Fugazi as I am.Yet on the other hand it also has the same feel to it as someones' rambling account of a great night out - I guess you had to be there.The authors' passion for her subject is palpable but some of the stories rendered in breathlessly mythic tones come off as rather inconsequential.I think the initiated will probably enjoy this book more than those unfamiliar with the american alternative scene so potential readers may want to bear that in mind"
4,"alright, not really about nirvana. mostly about old punk",if you're getting this just to read about nirvana-don't. it's mostly about old punk music like the sex pistols & the evolution of punk music upto the time of the first pressing.
2,"It's okay, I guess...","It's built more for collectors than children...it doesn't do more than move the arms and head, with a removable lightsaber. I wouldn't buy for anyone except a collector."
5,arrived on time,"Toe Separator Pedicure 100 Pack Salon Use- arrived on time, it's worth the money and really cheap. I'm going to buy it again."
2,"Very poor effort , Mark!","I had Mark's first book; it was a good program; so I ordered this thinking he had some new stuff added since it was 10 years from the last book. WRONG! This is a disappointing waste of money and time. First, no illustrations of the excercises since I forgot what some were( and he gives them crazy names too) , secondly, he just devotes a couple of paragraphs to ""rah, rah you can do it"" philosophy and nutrition. The book ends up being book of charts to check off as you go thru his ""program"". Then he pitches some supplements he obviously owns thru a company. Very disappointing...not up to the SEAL creed of performance I say.And he doesn't include swimming in the program. Do yourself a favor..don't waste you money. If you are famaliar with the pyramid method of working out, do that and increase the reps as you need too."
1,aeropress coffee maker,"Anyone that thinks this makes a good cup of coffee, doesn't know what good coffee tastes like. It uses more grounds than a regular coffee maker and it tastes like warm water with a little coffee in it. My drip will make one cup and the aeropress is just a lot of bother, and hoopla over nothing. A waste of 30 bucks. Yep, I followed all the directions and used expresso grounds. YUK, Shame on amazon for not testing this before selling it."
5,They are filters - not much to review,Work as described.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
5,Buy Coffee filters anywhere for this,"After I re-use the filters I make new ones by taking a pair of scissors and cutting out the pattern on any new paper filters you can buy in any store. Takes about 5 min to cut 50. That seems a lot quicker than waiting for the mail to deliver it to you. Now they are not perfectly round but they do the job of keeping out the grounds. I use the same size filters in my Bialetti Moca to create more pressure and also keep the unit cleaner. Save yourself some money and time by making these filters yourself, and if you dont like it then go buy this product."
2,filters,Not exactly what I thought they were and didn't really work to keep the dregs out of the coffee cup.
2,Great!,"These filters work as intended for the aeropress and are nice to reduce the acid in the coffee, leaving a lovely crema on top of your perfect cup!"
5,Great Product,I love my AeroPress and these filters are great for clean-up and for what they do. Would definitely buy them again.
5,Fantastic Coffee Filters,"These mini filters are so simple to use and work well. They keep out all types of coffee grounds and leave no residue in your coffee. They also leave no unpleasant ""paper filter"" taste in the coffee. They work extremely well."
5,wonderful little gadget!,I LOVE this product! Makes the best coffee EVER! I cant wait to take it with me when I go camping and show it off!
4,"Nice, but what do you want from a filter","I use the Aerobie coffee press a lot, probably too much. Fresh, good, coffee anytime I want it is has been great. Eventually this means filters. The price is OK, but shipping is high for this type of item and they are not available locally. I bought two packs to spread the shipping."
5,Very inexpensive for a good product,"I really like having SOOO many tiny filters so cheaply. They take next to no space, and though I have to order them, they're still cheaper than other coffee filters, besides creating less waste. Convenient, non-messy, and environmentally friendly."
3,Lots of filters,The filters are necessary for the AeroPress. I was a little dismayed to find that the device comes with a year's supply of filters. So now I have a two year's supply.
3,Great For Wedding Cakes...,"I bought this video series hoping to find decorating techniques for everyday cakes. It has a lot of advanced techniques used for decorating wedding cakes, but not much that I found useful for simple birthday cakes, etc."
5,"Great Book, Great Characterization","Finally, after a great many years, They are realeasing Star Trek Novels with good characterization that aren't all about Kirk. This book""s focus is on how Sulu, Chekov, and Uhurah deal with a hostile planet with no support from the Enterprise. While many of the elements in this book are similer to the other books written by L.A. Graf, This one fits in well with the mini-universe that is ""New Earth""."
1,Boring and illogical,"If you want to read a book about being buried in muck, this is the book for you! I only got halfway through this one. It was painful to read because the action was so slow, and I couldn't care less about the characters, even poor Chekov as written.The thing that annoyed me the most though is that the writer didn't seem to think about the world (s)he was writing in. The characters spoke and acted as if the colony had been around for years, the people having old sayings and developed farmlands and ranches and old habits, when the book itself says they've been on this new planet for about 6 weeks! Flaws in logic continued throughout, and combining that with muddy characters (in more ways than one) that I didn't care about, I just couldn't find a reason to go on. Don't waste your time."
3,Great story bad writing,"I gotta admit the first chapter or so bored me to death. But the story gets really good. I love the actual story format, but I don't like the way the writer wrote the story. What really threw me off is you have to really pay attention to the book when reading it, not distractions, because you'll miss key parts. ITs alomst like the writer put in detail in a sentence that tells you why something happend, and it seems to be put in out of the blue. Also like Dian Carey, they start another scene/chapter expecting you to have followed along, just giving a little back story of what happend since the previous chapter, and that just sucks. Like one page they're in the air in a shuttle, and the beginning of the next chapter they're walking the ground and getting shot at, and not untill a page or so later does the author exaplin what happend. Other then that though the storyline was awesome really entertaining."
1,Pseudo Trek,Poor story....poor character development. This reminds me of the Trek books 20 years ago that placed Star Trek characters in minor roles so the author could use his own created personas. Hated this book and the entire series!
1,A Star Trek Western,"Although I liked the two previous books (and also the three following ones)I absolutely hated this one!!! The idea of giving minor characters Sulu, Uhura and Chekov an oportunity was a great one, but the way L.A.Graf implemented it, is downright disgusting. What should have been a Star Trek novel turns out to be a western, with stables and tumbleweed included!!! I kept on reading just to see if it would get better but it never did. Skip this book if you can, it won't detract from the rest of the series and you'll save $6 in the process."
3,Sterile conducting; some interesting singing,"To my ear, Harnencort's conducting sounds detatched, like he's not enjoying the music much, even though he tries to sound playful with fast tempi and lots of percussion in the overture. The tenors and the women sound overrehearsed, sacrificing fun for precision.Matti Salminen's Osmin is very interesting, in that it is the most Wagnerian-sounding available Osmin on record. Matti Salminen puts Hagen-like murder into every syllable, even the coloratura sections. It's awesome, but the phrase ""bull in a china shop"" keeps coming to mind."
5,Incredible!,"It's a great record! Bubblemath plays a finely-worked music : powerful, great arrangements, not repetitive at all, so entrancing! I love their style!"
5,An almost perfect book,"I picked this up whilst doing some research for a film I am making on Rent Boys and expected a depressing and salacious read. What I got instead was a gentle, insightful book that was at times poetic, and always a pleasure to read. As a gay man with some experience on the scene, I though the author described perfectly the impulses and emotions that lead you into behaviour that could be labelled sex addiction. Whenever faced with the plethora or remarkable sights and experiences that can just seem to drift passed you as a gay man I have always uttered the response ""Life is Complex"". Well I think this book fully describes the complexity. In a way it reminded me of ""Bright Lights Big City""....but whereas I found that book rather sad in its litany of excess, this has a wistful, laid back quality that always seems positive even when describing the negative. This is one of those rare books...like the Tales of the City series, that I think I will find myself reading again and again."
1,Numbing,"I wanted to like this book. I mean, who doesn't love a good prostitution memoir? And I kept turning the pages, reading the book in one sitting, in spite of the fact that there was little to hold my attention. The insights are slight, and the incidents rather vague. The writing is competent, but nothing new; when the author complains about not being able to sell his novel, one can't help but think that he was already planning this memoir as he was turning tricks. And even that could have been interesting, but the overall effect of the this book is one of numbing indifference, but perhaps that is the effect that hustling has had on this author."
4,THIS IS AN UNUSUAL ITEM,"okay--though not an expert in porn, I think you will bedisappointed by this if that is what you expect. I pickedup the book because of the reference to Wittgenstein on theback cover, which I cannot resist. I believe Whitaker helped meunderstand something Wittgenstein wrote in his war notebooks that I never understood before. Whitaker talks about how hard it is to describe feelings, that it is easier to show them or see them expressed by someone's actions (which Wittgenstein would agree with.) Ironically enough, Whitaker succeeds in conveyinghow claustrophobic he felt during his years as a ""hustler"". This is a surprisingly affecting memoir that [pulls] you in almost from the beginning."
5,To paraphrase: The examined life is worth living,"The honesty of this book is its value. However, my sense is that what is honest today will change over time, as Whitaker is more able to face some of the harsher truths about his life. I look forward to hearing from him in the future, as he continues to gather the strength to reflect."
1,Boring with very little juicy details,Just didn't like it. Slow. Not very well written. I guess I was looking for a juicier story. If that is what you are looking for...you wont find it here. While the author appears to be very well read...he feels the need to quote almost every major author of the last 200. Wow an escort who can read...seems like that is the only thing he is out to prove.
4,Very good brush,"This Oral B Denture brush is very good, the bristles are just right not too hard and not too soft, unlike some that are like something that you would scrub the floor with. The only problem (very minor) is that the handle needs to be thicker(a little more ergonomic) it tappers to a point at the end of the handle making hard for people with arthritis to get a good grip on it. I would recommend it to denture wearers."
5,Oral B,I can not find these denture brushes in the town we live in...so very thankful to see them here...thanks again...
5,Terrific Combination,"This is the must-buy combination for anyone interested in learning how to write music. The accompanying CD provided a great high-energy backdrop for several new songs. The MIDI arrangements are really clear, so it was easy to hear my original melodies when I played along on guitar. There's lots of classic pop/rock material on the CD, too, which has inspired me to write in new styles. The sections on writing lyrics were really great."
2,Not for people who have a hard time with coordination and balance,"I did "" The 30 Day Shred"" and I loved it !!! I lost 2 inches off each my chest, waist and hips and 1 inch off my upper arms and thighs. Then I decided to try ""Ripped in 30"" and I hated it. I spent more time trying to figure out how to do the moves right and trying to keep my balance then actually working out. I just want some basic moves that don't require too much coordination or balance yet get results. So if you are like me don't bother with this DVD rather get "" The 30 day shred """
4,Ripped in 30,The DVD lived up to my expectations and then some as I continue to do my utmost to maintain fitness
4,Jillian is No Joke! Love her,Oka so it starts you out slow and by the 4th workout you are definitely feeling her wrath! LOL Great workout which progresses in intensity. Awesome job Jillian!
3,"Good, but...","...the workouts are NOT 24 minutes, like the box states. The first two are 36 minutes each. It might not be a big deal, but for a new mom with a baby, I was counting on a shorter workout. Jilllian is a bit obnoxious too, but I should have checked that out before I ordered the dvd. Thank God for the mute button, because the workouts are good..,,"
3,"Great workout, not my favorite.","This is a great workout, but I don't find it as challenging as I do some other Jillian videos. I usually rotate it with Killer Buns and Thighs and No More Trouble Zones, and this is my least favorite, although still a GREAT workout. Perhaps much heavier weights would change my mind."
3,Good work out.,"Love the workout, but u think I got a faulty video. It's hard to get it to the following weeks"
3,Crazy,This video is crazy. I have done the p90x and got through it. I barely got through half of this. Hard but you get a great workout
3,Wasn't ready for this one yet.,"Jillian is such a tough task master but very effective. I'm having to ease into this workout. I've gone through it once but that's all it took to determine I needed more toning and cardio to workout regularly with her. I do recommend it to all but use it cautiously at first. Once you start using it, you can see the difference quickly."
5,Amazing workou1t,"I previously purchased her firs ripped in thirty days and could not mak it through the workout. I never had a minute to catch my breath and just could not handle it. After reading the reviews on this one I decided to give her another chance because I love the way she encourages me to keep going and not give up. I just did my day one week one workout this morning and I feel great. She pushed the whole workout and we never stopped moving but unlike the first dvd the workouts were combined in a way to be able to catch a breath but still work hard! Im sooo happy I bought this and have recommended it to my mommies group for our own ""biggest loser mommy style"" we are all currently doing! I cant wait to weigh in next week after a whole week of working out with Jillian"
2,Would be good if all 4 workouts were on the DVD!,"I got started on week 1 and really liked the workout. I'm in pretty good shape, but I worked hard to finish it and was even a bit sore the next day in my glutes and hamstrings (yay!). I was also motivated to keep doing the workout and move through the weeks. Really good for a short workout. Jillian is a nice mix of tough, funny, inspirational, and high energy. If you want a sweet girl coaxing you into working out, this ain't for you. If you want someone cool to push you through a short but intense workout, she's your woman. I watched week 2 and it looked good too.BUT, when I tried to preview week 3 and 4, there was nothing to watch. Apparently no one put those files on this particular DVD. So now I have to deal with contacting the manufacturer or trying to make Amazon help me, or whatever. Or just giving up. It's impossible to communicate with anyone, it seems. Really disappointed with quality control."
3,Not Very Original,I have been a Jillian fan for over a year but was disappointed with this video. I found the exercises to be a combination between the ones from P90x and Bob Harper's DVDs. It was if she had run out of her own ideas and tailored something from other people. The 30-day shred had a flow to it but this DVD seems disjointed. OK but not my go-to DVD.
3,Too many plank moves,"The first two workouts on this DVD are ok, (the second one is the best) but I hated every second of the last two. There are wayyyyy too many plank moves. No one with any shoulder issues can do this workout without extreme discomfort. It's hard to focus on doing what you're supposed to be (eg. rows, cardio) when all you can think about is how much your shoulders hurt. She also says she doesn't repeat moves- technically true, but she does do a lot of the same moves over again, just making them a little harder in the later workouts. To me, that's not variety. Her banish fat boost metabolism is better, too bad it's an hour long. If it were broken up into 25 minute segments (like all of Jillian's ""20 minute workouts"" are) it would be the best one. I like her workouts generally, but guess I'll have to keep waiting for her to come out with a DVD I can stick with."
2,not worth the purchase,"this is one of those dvds that you would only do for your goal. i hated everytime i put it in, until i just stopped doing it which was about two weeks into it. im sure you would get results but its not enjoyable. sorry jillian.....i tried"
1,DVD did not work,"I ordered Jillian Michaels ripped in 30 twice and both tapes did not work. Week one did fine when i got to week two it froze up, and week 3 would not even come on. I was very dissapointed because i was looking forward to this workout."
1,DVD never worked - even 2nd copy,"I love Jillian workouts and have done almost all of her DVD's but the quality of this DVD is unacceptable. The first one I ordered stopped at 7 minutes into the workout and so I exchanged it for a new one. (Thanks, Amazon!) But the second one did the same thing a the same place. Is anyone else having this issue? Now it's too late to return the second one--life gets in the way and I forgot to request another exchange in time... Now I'm waiting for a copy from the library but I'm 20th on the list for 5 copies. Glad to know it's a good DVD, but disappointed that I paid for it and can't use it."
3,Lil less cocky please,I like 30 Day Shred way better than Ripped in 30. I thought she was way too cocky in this work out video. The way she talked wasn't motivating at all. It is a good work out but she was way more motivating in the 30 Day Shred. I love Jillian but cocky doesn't look good on her! I would have gave it a 5 star rating for the quality of the work out but calm down girl and don't be so arrogant lol
3,Rough on the knees,"I really want to like this workout DVD, but I caution anyone who does not have a background in exercise and physical fitness to be super careful. This DVD is definitely meant for a tougher crowd. I already worked out regularly doing yoga 2x per week and running 2x per week before buying this DVD. I wanted to try out Jillian's workouts because I am looking for more muscle definition. I am on week 3 now and definitely gaining some muscle in my arms, back and legs, but her workouts are really tough on the knees. Many of the strength and cardio exercises I am unable to do to because of this issue. It makes me feel sort of defeated because if it weren't for the stress on the joints I could keep up with the advanced person on many of the exercises! Some of her moves are great, and once I become more comfortable with the exercises I do like, I am just going to take my favorites and the ones that don't kill me knees, from the 4 weeks and create my own routine."
4,happy,Happy with the dvd. Likes that she give you a modifier so you can work your way up and not feel completely out of shape.
5,welcome to jillian's party,"Jillian knows what she's doing. This is my first purchase of her DVDs and seriously, she knows how to make you get in there and work out. If you like to sweat and enjoy the type of workout that makes you so sore you can't wait to do it again, this one is for you. Her 3-2-1 workout is easy to follow and keeps you in for the long run as you know when the end is in sight. I truly enjoy this DVD!"
2,Too many new moves!,"I have done Jillian's 30 Shred and found this product to have too many moves forced into such a short time. The yoga moves were too rushed, she rotated between moves too quickly, and frankly I felt like I couldn't concentrate on form and quality and was being pushed towards injury. I have returned to the Shred and also added Tony Horton to the mix. What's up with those girls helping her out anyway?"
3,Is it necessary??,"It is a good workout. I only do level 4. The other 3 are not challeging enough for me.In the middle of the workoutJillian steps on one of the girls back on her shoe, and started to yell at her to get up.I mean... really? Does she think it is entertaining? I mean one can be a good popular trainer and still be respectful."
2,Please STOP TALKING!!!,"I'm sure this is an excellent exercise plan, but I never got past the first five minutes of any of the four workouts because Jillian Michaels NEVER SHUTS UP. She's not funny or clever and it's just too damn annoying to listen to her prattle on and on for me to use this DVD. A waste of money for me. If you have no patience for Jillian's attitude, pass on this one. I prefer Amy Dixon's style--doesn't yell at you or try to be amusing all the time. Still a challenge, but sweet and helpful rather than abrasive."
1,Inappropriate,"The video has inappropriate language and behavior. She starts off the week one workout using the a** word to describe one of the girls. Later, about 1/3 of the way into the week 1 workout, she has the girl she called an a** put her head into Jillian's clevage to speak into her mic. Not sure what else happens in the video, turned the video off before week 1 workout was done. Not going to subject my self to the inappropriate language and behavior just to work out."
5,KICK BUTT WORKOUT,"I have done the level 1 work out for 3 days and I have never seen such fast results from a dvd workout. I can honestly say that I feel my body changing from this workout. While I have been very sore, my energy level is higher and I am able to complete the exercises with much improved posture/stance. I think it is important to start with level one and move up as you feel comfortable. I watched the other levels (there are 4 total) and it seems each level is necessary to build up to the intensity of level 4. I'm eager to see where I will be in 30 days as I have already lost 4 lbs in 3 days, and feel a huge physical change occuring. I recommend this DVD to anyone. I'm a fan of Jillian Michaels workouts, and have all of them on DVD. This DVD is by FAR her best yet. You will get more from this workout than the 30 day shred, just know it is much more difficult."
4,Great work out,"I was sooo sored the next day, great work out! I have not used it for very long yet, but definetly a good combo of work outs."
5,ripped in 30 days,I just turned 65. Now in the beginning I am cheating (very little tough) here and there.But I am getting stronger quickly.
5,Ouch Jillian... Ouch,"I bought this to add variety to her 30 day shred DVD, to motivate me into getting off the couch once again and to get into shape for the summer. She absolutely rocks my workout. I feel pushed to my limits and at first I often had to take a breather but after 3 weeks on ""Week 1"" I can complete the entire workout and am ready to move on to ""Week 2"". That's right.. I'm not going to get ripped in 30 days but I'm already stronger, lost 5lbs and feeling once again challenged to get fit.Bring it on!"
2,Don't try this if you are a beginner,"As a beginner I wanted a short but effective workout. Although I liked the workouts on this DVD, but I was left with terrible backaches even though I only did the modified versions. Some of the moves I couldn't do at all. I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner at all."
5,Efficient and quick workout,"I really like this dvd. Its challenging but not discouraging. There is a modified version of almost every move which is helpful for beginners. I don't have a lot of time so an efficient workout is key for me, and this fits the bill. I understand some reviewers find Jillian Michaels attitude offensive, but I did not feel that way at all. Its more like tough love - she pushes you but also reiterates that you CAN do it if you commit. I appreciate the reminders that taking it easy won't give me the results I want, and its only 20 minutes of hard work - totally do-able. One warning - be careful with the running man and ""butt kick"" moves. I have an old knee injury that flares up from moderate/high impact activities, so I march in place with the swinging arms for these parts and it still keeps my heart rate up."
5,L.O.V.E. This workout! she did it again and I have the body to prove it!,"OMG I am such a fan of Jilian Michaels and I eagerly awaited this new work out video and I loved it! I just completed 30 days (in 5 weeks, did it 6 days a week start at week 1 and the 5th week was 2 days level 4, 2 days level 3 adn 2 days level 2)it is awesome. she got rid of all that annoying stuff in the beginning so you can get straight to the workout.she's yelling and screaming at you and I love it..i was totally winded and exhausted! I LOVEDmy body is firmer and I definitely have some mini ""guns"" (my arms)very pleased very pleased and highly recommend.if you are a novice exerciser this isn't for you...if you want to get in shape and are willing to suffer for 30 minutes this is for you you will not be disappointed."
3,Harder on the knees,"The workouts are a lot harder on your knees than 30 day shred and there's not great ways to modify them to be gentler on your knees like 30 day shred. My husband likes this one better than 30 day shred because there's more ""running"" stuff involved but again, if you have knee issues avoid this DVD."
5,Love it :),"I have done a lot of workouts, and this is by far one of my favorites! Worked out all body parts and got a little cardio in. Great if you are in moderate-intermediate shape, probably not for beginners. I used it to supplement other workouts and gained a lot ot strength. Jillian gets a little wild, but she will give you an awesome workout."
5,One of my favs!,"In my opinion, this is one of Jillians best videos. It kind of reminds me of the 30DS, but these workouts flow a lot better and keep my attention. I have only done week 1 and 2 because I got pregnant shortly after I bought it, but even at 32 weeks pregnant I still am able to do week 1 and get a great workout (with some modifications)."
4,Can injury the wrists,"I didn't know a thing about jillian and never used any of her DVDs prior to getting this as a gift from a friend. She liked this workout but warned me of the strain it placed on her wrists and her need to modify some of the routines because of it. I found the workouts great to do at home, and I took the wrist warning with a grain of salt after almost 2 weeks without a problem. Sure enough after completing week 2 I can barely use my left wrist. It didn't hurt during the working out, but afterwards both wrists started giving me some pain. My right wrist was better within 2 days but my left one has gotten progressively tighter and more painful. I have trouble lifting things, like me toddler, for the past 3 days.I'm hoping that my wrist will be better soon so that I can modify the routines and keep going."
5,Another great Jillian workout!,"I used to do the 30 Day Shred on demand and decided to purchase this to follow up. All I can say is Jillian is the trainer that you love to hate. You know that she is challenging your body and as promised I saw better results in 30 days of ""Ripped"" than anything I've tried before. I saw results especially in my arms and butt and I did not follow the meal plan and I only did the video every other day. To clarify though if you are extremely overweight you are going to end up toned or cut rather ""than ripped"" because there is no magic potion that comes with this video but if you follow her meal plan and do the workouts you will be more than satisfied with the results and likely look better than you ever did before."
3,Nice,"I am getting stronger doing this, but not losing weight. Perhaps i don't really have to lose weight at this point. I am 5'6 and 124 lbs (previously 121). Doing this along with IF seems to have increased my muscle mass.Great work out for those looking to get stronger.Not so great if your looking to drop the lbs. I think HIIT is much more effective if thats what your looking for.I will definitely be doing more of her videos though. :D"
3,Good but negatives make this 3*s,Jillian is annoying in this DVD- the chatting and her attitude is distracting. Also- she has some very unfriendly exercises for anyone with any kind of knee sensitivity.
4,say it aint so,"Did this workout in 4 weeks, 6x a week, and definitely saw results. Core was stronger, balance improved, and obviously strength increased and entire body toned up. I cleaned up my eating a little bit but still drank alcohol at least twice a week... I wonder what would happen if I didn't drink at all. I also jogged 4-6 times a week for 20-30 minutes. I used to be a high school, D1, and professional volleyball player. If anyone's knees should hurt you think it would be mine but they felt normal during every workout. Maybe my body was use to the impact and movement I don't know. Jillian's banter was annoying! I highly recommend putting her on mute and turning up your ITunes... makes the workout go faster. I felt improvement every week and continued to sweat through out each workout."
4,Awesome!,I love this dvd- each workout has new moves so that keeps it interesting. i spent two weeks on level 1 beacuse the cardio in the first circuit is intense. I think level 3 is a lot more interesting and fun while still maintaining the difficulty. Level 3 is harder on my knees so I sometimes adjust the workout to make it easier- jumping lunges I'm talking to you! But all in all as long as I have music or the tv on to mute her I'm all good. Just too much talking from her in general but I love the workouts so I have no problem upping the volume on my jams :)
5,4 awesome workouts for 1 low price!,"This workout is easy, fast and effective. As a busy mom of three, I really enjoy being able to workout hard for 20 minutes and be done. Plus, you really do see results fast! The online meal plan is very helpful too."
4,Whipped in 30 (minutes)!!,"I was hesitant to try this DVD based on other feedback about level of difficulty (I'm somewhere between beginner and intermediate). But other reviews were not lying, you DO work your butt off. The 3-2-1 method keeps you on your toes and the 30 minutes flies by. In week 1/day 1, I was out of breath, dripping in sweat but felt challenged (and slightly sore!). By week 1/day 2, it got easier and my endurance already improved. I did not get this DVD to literally get ripped in 30 but as an alternative to a gym and a way to stay active (and tone up) -- and on those fronts, it's a great DVD. I do find Jillian a little annoying but appreciate her preaching on perfect form. It's hard to notice when you're not doing things right if you don't have the big mirrors around that gyms have. Still, this is a great DVD for a beginner looking to take the next step."
4,Excellent video - not for beginners,"Varied, very tough video. I'm an advanced exerciser and it's difficult for me! You must have good body awareness and great form. It gives you results!!"
5,Jillian Does It Again!,"I was skeptical that a workout would be better than 30 Day Shred, but I assure you, it most definitely is. One thing I love about this workout is that the 3 minutes of strength is broken down into three different movements at 30 seconds each rather than two movements (one at 30 seconds and then one at one minute as it is in 30 Day Shred). This works more muscles which makes me feel like I got more of a workout. I can definitely feel the burn each day, but it feels great, not overly sore (mind you, I work out typically 5 days a week). Jillian shows you some ways you can modify some of the moves, and ways you can make the standard moves even more challenging (of course, she doesn't want you to modify anything if you don't have to). Overall, awesome workout that I'd suggest to anyone!!"
5,J.M. Ripped in 30,"Great workout - even though there's no way this 64 yr old, un-conditioned body can do all these exercises as illustrated, I can certainly do what I can in following the workout which is challenging, to say the least, and since its far above my capabilities at this time, there is room to grow and there are challenges to be conquered. I'm enjoying the exercise and I'm excitedly anticipating the positive changes in this body in 6 months' time."
5,best workout video!,"I'm always skeptical of whether workout videos really own up to their claims.. with Jillian Michaels, there is absolutely no question that her dvd will give you results. I'm two weeks into the four week program and I've already noticed more tone on my whole body. You must work hard, but as long as you put in the effort this is the best video I've every done"
4,Great interval workout!,"I haven't completed the four weeks yet, but so far it's been good. I've been doing this in addition to my other workouts and love the short bursts of cardio and planks. I'll let you know if I get ripped in 30!"
4,Pretty Good,I think it's a pretty good workout. Kicks your butt at first but you get stronger really fast and it's encouraging to have such fast results.
5,workout dvd,I workout 7 days a week with a mix of a lot of cardio and a good amount of weights and this DVD was still challenging to me. I love it when I discovered new moves and workouts and I can feel it the next day. This is a great whole body workout and Jillian does a greate job mixing up the routines throughout the whole series. Great buy!
4,Great!,I bought this about 3 weeks ago and it was easily the best thing I ever did :D I've already lost 15 lbs!!! I feel better about myself now. It's hard work but it defiantly paid off :)
5,I Heart Jillian!,"This is an amazing workout that is great for those short on time! My first Jillian workout DVD, and I understand why she is so effective. I underestimated the routine. I completed L1/D5 today! My back, abs, arms, and thighs were pretty sore on day 2-4. My body is finally adjusting today (day 5) but still sore! I love this because it's working out different muscles that my current routine is neglecting. I have been doing Turbo Fire for some time now and love the cardio. I have had incredible results. However, I wanted to add some new life to my current workout routine that included some weights/strength training. This exceeded my expectations! I look forward to this workout because it's a quick workout. I can feel my body really firming up within the first week. The four workouts on this DVD makes this the best 10 bucks I've ever spent:)"
5,I'm in pain!,Excellent workout. I have to rest between several sets but that's what I want. Definitely a challenge! Love it!
5,Loved it!,"Great, tough work out. I did find week 3 more challenging than week 4, but all together...awesome work out."
3,Wow,"I have started and stopped this DVD a few times now and I never seem to get past level 2. These workouts are tough even though they are only 30 minutes each. I find that some of the moves are too difficult, especially in the order that she does them. For instance, most of level two is done in plnak or some other position where most of your weight is on your hands/wrists. I find that I can do the exercises without my muscles giving out but my wrists/hands are hurting so bad that I have to stop. I wonder if I'm doing them correctly and tried to just watch the video but they never really get close enough to see how the two girls actually doing the workouts position their hands. I'm a huge Jillian fan but some of these moves are just a little too crazy with not enough emphasis on the form you should be using."
3,chatterbox,"I enjoy the the circuit training and I get a good sweat. dieting combined with hydroxicut has helped me shred weight. I just have this to comment about Jillian...she is so annoying, chatting, and has this cocky way of talking to her trainers....I have to blast my music to muffle her annoying voice."
3,An Effective Workout,"This is one of the hardest workouts that I have ever attempted. I made it through 4 weeks and saw definite results - especially in the bicep area. If you like Jillian Michaels, you will love this workout."
5,Jillian Ripped in 30,"This is an excellent workout, well worth the money. The only thing I would like better is to have the option to have 2 of the workouts combined to have an hour workout. You can do 2 separately, but you have downtime fast-forwarding and selecting the next workout."
5,One of her best,"I love the different levels of workouts and the challenge/intensity that Jillian always gives. This workout is definitely tough, but if you push yourself, you will see results. Now if I could just convince myself to do them more often..."
5,Jillian Will Kick Your Butt,"I absolutely love this dvd. It's a great workout. I have been riding a bike 6 days a week for 40 minutes so I thought I was in pretty decent shape. I was wrong!! Jillian kicked my butt...big time! My legs were incredibly sore for 2 days after. But you know what, I loved it! If you want a great workout, buy this dvd!"
2,"Great workout, but not for those with low back issues","No doubt she delivers on her promise of an intense workout. However, there are lots and lots of bending over exercises where the low back erector muscles are used. I have low back issues and this seriously aggravates it. Be careful!"
3,Not the Greatest DVD,"I have alot of Jillian Michaels' fitness tapes, this one is O.K. but not the greatest. The workouts are supershort even though they're intense, I still feel shortchanged. At the end of week four Jillian goes into a very long and boring speech about mind spirit yada yada yada it's really ridiculous, if your at week for you know why your there you don't need a lecture, week one maybe. Her best tape is No More Trouble Zones, it hits everything, even though she never does the same amount of reps on each side cause she's so busy talking! I think she likes the sound of her voice so much she can't be quiet. I recommend Cathe Freidrich HIIT an awesome interval training video!"
3,the only reason for a 3 is...,she talks to much!!! i'm only in week two and thus far i'm enjoying the workouts. the ONLY reason i give this dvd a three star is b/c jillian worked my last nerve with her talking and some of the things she said i felt were inappropriate. telling someone you want to bite thier butt b/c it is so tight (not verbatum) bothered me. other than her talking to much i really do like the workouts. i have 30 shred and although her comments were not far left field she did talk to much so i guess i should be used to it. good workouts and worth the money if you can get past her talking.
4,overall pleased,"Jillian's work out is refreshing to someone who does the typical ""feel good about yourself"" videos with women smiling and making everything seem so simple. Jillian is honest and herself in the videos. She tells it like it is and give motivation to stick with it. I normally give up after the first few workouts with other dvds, but this one has kept me going for a couple weeks now. I will definitely consider more of Jillian's dvds."
4,jillian michales dvd 3 2 1 workout,Great workout dvd. If u are out of shape and never workout in ur life then this dvd is not for BEGINNERS. It will make u sore and out of breath. It's only a 20min workout.
4,hope it works!,"Like the work outs (only on week 2) and how they change each time. It's quick and fun, and I can get it done during nap time. I might change this to a 5 star once I am done with the full four weeks!"
1,Disappointed,"Video is not motivating at all and plays a horrible, constantly repeating 'music' .... if you can call that music. I plan to turn the sound off and play some normal music while I get some use out of the video."
2,Meh...,"I have to agree with others. Her ego is ridiculously huge in this DVD and she never shuts up. It was really hard to make it through 30 days. I like that she has moderators. The workouts are intense but are overshadowed by her rudeness and constant talks about nothing that matters. I had a better experience with her Kickboxing Fastfix. I am looking to try her Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones soon but Ripped in 30 is in the closet as a back-up for real hard times...if that!Sorry, this DVD was not tolerable on any level."
3,A bit frustrated :(,"Ok, I luv Jillian but I'm a bit frustrated at the moment. I have not worked out in a while and I am short on time so I thought this program would be great. Anyhow, I am 5'2"" and weigh 120. I want to slim down a bit more...roughly 5lbs. I am at the beginning of week 4 and HAVE NOT LOST A SINGLE POUND :( I'm watching my diet and even started extra 30 min of cardio. Also added a10 min ab DVD. Still NOTHING! I did however gain muscle I did not have but that's about it. No real visual change yet. I'm doing all of the moves correctly. I'm sweating up a storm and I try my best to follow the advanced moves when I can. What is the issue? Help? I have 5 days left and feel like giving up. What can possibly change in 5 days?"
5,This is a good one!,I now own 4 or 5 of Jillian's workout DVD's and am very please with all of them. I have others that go into rotation but hardly ever do I purchase a second video from the same trainer so that should tell you something. Jillian always trys to add new and different moves to each of her videos and no matter what others say I think she is a fun trainer simply TRYING to motivate you to do your best! Stick with her and you will see results! This video breaks it down so you can get a full hard core work out or break it down to the time you have available and your level of fitness. This is not a complicated workout with a lot of jumping and dance moves. Jillian shows how to preform each exercise and will give you time to get your form right before moving on. That is a big a PLUS!
5,Ripped in 30.... WOW,"I lost 40 pounds using Jillians 30 day shred and have been waiting for a new shred workout,.. I am on week 2 and I LOVE IT.. I have about 12 pounds to lose and this video will help me get there... One thing I like the best is the 3 30 second strengths ... It breaks it up and I feel like I am working more of my muscles. It is a tough workout but I feel amazing and proud of myself when I am done... THANK YOU JILLIAN...."
5,Love this. Better than Shred!,"I have to write a review about this workout. I had a few friends recommend this, and say they liked it better than 30 Day Shred. I agree.Here's Why:I had just completed Day 20 of 30 Day Shred. Not a day went by that my knees weren't aching. I was getting concerned that I shouldn't just be pushing through the knee pain. I found the moves too repetitive. Ripped in 30 moves were more varied. I didn't feel the joint fatigue in this workout at all.After Day 20 of Shred, I was favoring my joints and having a harder time getting a workout. Sweat was pouring off of my body in week 1 of Ripped. I don't think it was harder, just more varied, so you could push yourself more.Lastly, after 3 days of Ripped, I had sore muscles. Keep in mind I was on Day 20 of Shred. This workout does a way better job of working out hamstrings, lower back, inner thighs, etc. I felt like Shred just worked out the same muscle groups.Besides all that, the stretching/cool down is way better.Love it!"
4,"Great book, well written, fast moving","A great book which reviews the closing days of the Vietman conflict. The author interviews military, political leaders, civilians and press from both sides. It's a fast moving piece with plenty of action.The downside of the book is that there are no maps or photos of some of the US Marines discussed, which would have been useful in understanding where battles were located. I found a web site, which has photos and also gives additional information atwww.fallofsaigon.org. Great book!"
1,Poor Quality and Over Daramatized,"This book overly dramatizes a situation that was already dramatic on its own. It uses obscene language just for the purpose of being obscene. The editing is terrible. I found mistake after mistake, even on the back cover of the book. Frank Snepp's ""Decent Interval"" and David Butler's ""The Fall of Saigon"" are both far superior to this almost fictional account. This book reminds me of a modern action movie. It is written for twelve-year olds who want to see lots of special effects, but no substance."
2,Dial and hands too small,The watch was too heavy. The dial and hands were too small to read properly without having to adjust your arm. Not pratical for someone needing to always check for time
1,Buyer Beware,"I decided to roll the dice with this, despite some people saying it didn't adhere well. I wish I hadn't.I cleaned the surface of my wooden front steps thoroughly, waited ample time for it to dry, and then affixed the take to the stairs, making sure to press firmly and repeatedly over the strips with a rolling pin to make sure they were seated well. It was all for naught, as 3 days later when it rained, they peeled right up, and fell off.It looks nice, and works well until it rains, and you actually NEED it..."
2,Does not last in the rain.,This might be a good product for indoor or covered outdoor use but it did not hold up in the rain.
4,almost perfect,"My dad is in his late 80s so I wanted to make sure the cellar steps were safe for him. He had already purchased small bright white strips (better suited for the bathtub). I replaced them with this wider, more secure and more textured tape and was very happy. The texture is not sandpaper rough, rather more athletic gear rugged. This is a quality product. So, why is my title ""almost perfect?"" Because it is dark grey in color (only option I could find). After affixing strips of this to each stair, I then had to cut up dad's old white strips and place a bit on each end of the grey strip and two long slivers between the edge of the grey tape and the very edge of the stair. The stairs now look like a runway at LAX, lol, but the result is everything I wanted. If this 3M tape came in off-white, of course, it would be perfect (dark enough to hide dirt, bright enough to reflect light well). 3M, do you read reviews?"
3,Indoor/Outdoor Tread,I bought this & the outdoor tread strips for my deck steps & ramp. Both came in within a week. The feel on this is more like textured rubber and is safe to walk on: won't hurt the feet. This one says it is made for indoor and outdoor use but I wouldn't recommend it for outdoor use. I applied this product to my steps and three days later it rained and began peeling off. I'd advise to buy more than one roll if you have do so a lot of steps or ramps. The roll I received was only enough to cover three steps. I'd buy this again for indoor use only.
3,"good but slightly dated review of american ""serious"" music","just a brief warning that this book wasoriginally written and published in the UK in1985, and as such is a little dated in its coverage. still, with chapters on artists as diverse as keith jarrett, talking heads, neil young, sondheim and elliott carter, its a satisfying romp through distinctly american music."
1,Don't believe favorable evals from wincleaner staff. This product is garbage!,"I have purchased hundreds of items, including software from this site over the past decade plus. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTELY WORST ITEM THAT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED FROM THIS SITE OR ANYWHERE!!!!The software worked for only ONE computer!!! NUMEROUS EMAILS to wincleaner are fully ignored.THIS COMPANY IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!Do not be fooled by trolls who give this product more than one star! The company must have employees log on to give this product favorable evaluations, but read the truth for the numerous people who have been robbed by wincleaner.Offered serial number, valid purchase info., but wincleaner does not even take the time to respond w. activation code.Save your money and buy air!"
3,So-So K. 139,"Though featuring noted conductor (Harnoncourt) and soloists, this Teldec production is inferior to an old Philips record I have (Radio Chorus and Radio Symphony Orchestra Leipzig) which, unfortunately, has never been reproduced on CD."
5,Great Linguistic scholarship that's also fun reading!,"I was impressed with this book not only because of Tomas Kalmar's clear mastery of the topic and knowledge of linguistics but also because of how flat out fun the book was to read: engaging and to the point, this book takes a serious look at what it's like to be a migrant worker in the US, struggling with language barriers and discrimination and highlights the strength of the Latino community. Because of the detailed linguistic content, I'm using it for a coursebook next semester. Because it's a fine read, I'm giving it as a gift to nonlinguist friends. BTW: if you happen to be English/Spanish bilingual, there are some very funny bits!"
5,Cultures Clashing,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. You should buy this book right away. Tomas Kalmar is an unrecognized genius in the world of bilingual literacy. This book is a must read if you're at all interested in events shaping the Americas right now. Before you've made up your mind where you stand on the issue of ""secure borders,"" you must read Kalmar. He invokes a tradition dating back hundreds, even thousands of years, and brings it all into perspective. I can't say enough about this book or this great scholar. Did you know Alfred the Great wasn't born on the date on the famous statue in London? Who knew?"
2,an okay book for beginners,"simplistic and to the point. not necessarily a bad thing in a book about writing, but Writing Horror seemed specifically geared towards people who are *considering* writing horror, rather than those who are actually doing it.also, the book itself is pretty cheaply made. i dropped it (at a distance of about 2 feet) and the binding split."
4,Great entry level course on horror writing,"I've been writing since I was 15 but I've lacked the initiative and experience to finish a story, now that I've read Writing Horror I've done the exercises and finished a few stories. I found the sections on the seven steps of plotting and the five ways to open a story immensely helpful. The exercises and advice are geared towards short story writing although there's a few helpful hints about book length fiction. Throughout the book Van Belkom stresses how hard the publishing industry is, only those who stick it out will make it in this business. Also of note, being a fellow Canadian it's refreshing to see a writing book told from the perspective of a Canadian author. Use this book to write a story and Renni Browne's Self Editing For Fiction Writers to edit it into print. I can't recommend this book enough."
5,"If you want to write horror, you need this book!","As someone who has written and sold a number of horror short stories, I can tell you that this book is right on the money. Edo van Belkom knows the markets and he knows what it takes to make it in this crazy business.If you're just starting out and you want to write horror, you should begin by buying this book. Read it. The book is jam-packed with common sense and examples. Follow Edo's suggestions, do the exercises and then apply your seat to the chair in front of your computer and get busy writing and submitting your work.For those of you who are already selling your horror stories and novels at a professional level, WRITING HORROR won't help you nearly as much, but it's fun to read, it's tax deductible and most important, it makes you want to get some writing done."
1,Prevent and Treat Diabetes with Natural Medicine,"This is not the same book that was advertised, little if anything is mentioned about using natural medicines.the titles are of the books are similar, the copy I received is ""How to Prevent, treat and self-manage Diabetes and related complications (2nd edition), by M. K. Ansari.I don't know if they are one and the same book, if so I am very disappointed, would not recomend this book for those looking for natural options."
4,book for my Dad,I bought this book for my dad and he is satisfied with the content of the book.He told me the text is easy to understand and Scientific at the same time.
3,Great book for teachers to read in their class,"My reading ASU instructor read this book to us. The book is long, could be condensed and still be great. The concept of this book is amazing and is well written. I have a problem with how much of a focus they put on how Petey is lonely and makes the reader feel sorry for him through the whole story...it is a bit much."
2,Not so good.,"I really didn't like this book, and I was surprised to see how high other people rated it. Granted, it had a very interesting premise, the treatment of the disabled in the early 1900s, but the characters, especially Petey, were two-dimentional and unbelievable, and the tone of the book was sappy and sentimental. I couldn't relate to the narrator at all. I wouldn't reccomend this book."
1,Blah.,"OK. How do I start this off? So I was forced to read this book for 8th grade Language Arts. The plot is a good one, if Ben Mikaelsen could write. His writing if for 5th graders, however uses vocabulary for 9th graders. He doesn't describe some important parts in Peteys life and put to many characters into the book which causes confusion when he doesn't describe them. Please, save yourself the money and buy To Kill A Mockingbird instead."
5,You've Gotta Read This!! Wonderful for all Ages,"I work as an aide for kids with special needs and a librarian recommended this to me. I feel this quick read (elementary school level)is a MUST READ for anyone going into the special education field. Beyond that, I feel that it should be a classic group reading activity for upper elementary school kids. It's a wonderful story and it really makes you think. Acceptance & Understanding are lessons well learned."
4,petey,"Petey book is the best I've ever read. It's about a boy that lives in a mental institution but he is not mental he just has cerebral palsy (A dysfunction in the brain that doesn't allow you to walk) the pain and hurt that Petey has gone through and knowing that he gets a friend makes it that much better. This book really sounds believable it seems like it can happen in real life. I love this book but I don't like the way he starts it he just rambles on about nothing about the real story so their for I give it 4 **** (stars) and I lost some interest and it made me want to stop reading. But... once he gets the (real) story going it got me hooked again and I was done before I no it. And it was due the next day so... but yes, I like this book and would recommend it for any one one that has at least 5 min to start the story then you (warning) WILL BE HOOKED!!!By the way I just saved a whole bunch of money on my car insurance!"
5,Wonderful Childrens/Young Adult Book!!,"My son 13, loved this book...he actually brought it home from school for me to read because he was so taken with this novel. The book is about Petey-his life living differently from the majority of society. Petey might look different, he might talk different but his heart and mind is bigger than most of us! Petey is a person we should all strive to mimic, a person who gives so much more than most of us. This book can't help but be a guide to many middle school children-and to be honest, many adults. A must read for people of all ages!"
1,No time to enjoy it,"Got the product, with an expiration date of 2 days after I received the product. Was hoping to give it as a gift... ended up throwing it away. Understand perishable, but not something that is unedible."
5,Great,"If you are tired of the dark, indoor enviroments of the Quake type engines and are ready for great outdoor enviroments with plenty of exploration and secrets then this game is for you. Do not let the price fool you. I am running the game in 1024X768 on an Athlon 850mhz/256megs ram/Radeon 8500 DDR/ Win2k Sr-2/ and it plays wonderfully. The only thing I notice is the occasional frame rate drop when entering a new area, but it is minor and probably can be corrected with a few tweaks with the video settings. The graphics are way better than in the first SS"
5,"fun, fun, fun...","graphics galore!, shoot a tree with the rocket launcher and watch, much, much fun, a must have..."
4,Correction to Leo C Robinson's Review,"Reviewer does not have his information correct.Serious Sam 1 and 2, by Croteam, does NOT use the Quake 3 Engine. Serious Sam (1) was originally merely a tech demo for a graphical engine, now known as the ""Serious Engine"". The game was later built around this engine, when the engine proved to be so popular and impressive. Serious Sam 2 uses a modified/extended version of this engine."
3,INSANE!,"This game is just, well, my title describes it. I would like to know exactly what these Croatians were on and where I can get some. Imagine your most bizarre dream (or drug trip) and combine it with Quake.Yeah, Quake. This game really could have been made in 1996. Technically, it doesn't impress and could very well have been released as shareware.But hey, it's cheap. I'd buy it just to see the guy with the pumpkin on his head and the chainsaw.If you like ""Serious Sam"", also check out ""Will Rock""."
2,Long loading times,First of all I watched all the demos in this game and I have to say I just couldn't wait to get a new game started. Then when the game started to load it took for at least half an hour to load and when it was finished the game went blank screen. I don't know if its just the disk or my computer but I doubht it was my computer. Just look at the disk when you get to the car and don't be like me and miss all of the action.
4,A worthy successor,"SS:SE is the perfect sequel to Serious Sam. It's more of the same great gameplay with new settings and great new levels. I enjoyed it every bit as much, altough it's my opinion that the ending was not as good.Every bit as good as the first, and it's an inexpensive title too, so get it!"
4,A great sequel to a great title,"Serious Sam 2 picks up where Serious Sam left off. The game essentially has the same engine with some improvements. It also contains new weapons, enemies and of course brand new levels. Serious Sam 2 is even more fun than the original and multiplayer cooperative matches are simply a blast!"
3,Serious Sam : The Second Encounter,"Serious Sam : The Second Encounter is a first person shooter, It is an expansion pack but you do not need the orginal game to install or play. The single player gameplay is excellent, The gameplay is just shoot every thing that moves and proceed to the next level but it is still fun playing. The level design is superb with very long levels and lots of enemies but unlike the first game there are many jumping puzzles and they not fun playing which is why i gave it only three stars. The multiplayer gameplay is not that great but the co-operative gameplay is outstanding, It is one of the best co-operative games i have ever played. Serious Sam is built on the serious engine. I played it on the OpenGL video mode and it runs great. Direct3D is also available but not as polished as OpenGL. The game runs great even when there are hundreds of enemies on screen at the same time. Serious Sam SE is an excellent game if you like doom type fps."
4,Seriously Fun and Difficult but married by thin performance!,"Serious Sam the Second Encounter has no story, just oldskool gameplay. The graphics are nothing special, pretty neat effects, but nothing that raises the bar past unreal or quake. The sound system is pretty unique and realistic, and the music eyecandy is cool. The gameplay is fun and tough, literally hundereds of freaky and hard big enemies and you using big guns and armor at the same time in huge interesting levels with great arcitecture. At maxed settings at high resolutions, the game performs pretty disapointing on low and med-end system setups, but on hi-end system setups the game performs decent.The game is seriously meant for multiplayer. Poly counts are kind of low. Its' a great game overall but not the best."
2,"Nice Height, Poor Legs","This tripod seemed to be very nice... Until we tried to extend the legs all of the way. Two and a half of the legs worked well, the third had a section that would not stay extended. The locking devices are pretty poor. They are made of a cheap plastic and I believe that even the ones that do work well now, will not last very long with even moderate use. Next time I will try to find a tripod with a set screw type of leg extension lock."
2,So-so,The height is very nice but why does it woble so much even when it is not fully extended? I also did not like the way the leg clips are made. They are plastic and one has already broke off.
3,Cheap for a reason,"Haven't used it much but the panning is horrible. Not smooth at all, better take the the camara off the tripod with the quick release function which is nice."
3,Tall Tripod quick assembly,"Liked the EZ set up and gives me the height I was looking for to produce quality video. Found a squeak during a horizontal/level turn with and without the video camera attached. Didn't see a way to reduce the squeak sound. Otherwise, this is a solid tripod and will work great for still photos."
5,Good value!,"Haven't tried it in windy conditions yet but I like that it's lightweight, easy to transport and extends to 70 inches. The extra height extension prevents you from stooping over when shooting videos. Good value, and free shipping (delivered in 5 days to Hawaii - not bad!) from Amazon only makes it better! Highly recommended."
4,Good quality for the low price,"I've used this product extensively for the past 7 years. It has traveled with me over a broad range of terrain and climatic conditions. It is easy to use and sets up quickly, level gauge is quite helpful. It is light-weight (aluminum frame) which makes it easy to carry in a sling case over the shoulder, but makes it harder to remain steady in a windy location. There is a hook at the bottom of the center stem that takes care of that issue, by loading a weight on it. This product is suitable for most cameras and plastic optics, however if you are using a glass based telephoto lens (>3 lbs) the plastic platform on which the camera/lens rests can buckle under the weight.Use carefully if shooting on sand, as it can get into the sliding mechanism of the legs and can potentially seize it."
3,Quality control,"Although just received and not yet tested, this product appears to be a good value for money. However, I had an issue with quality control. One tiny screw was missing in the leg attachment. I requested vendor DB Roth to simply have the manufacturer send me the screw and I could have resolved the problem. But they insisted on return and replacement. Okay, but I was delayed two full weeks! No upgrade on UPS ground to expedite delivery. With all due respect, there is some advantage to purchasing local."
1,Cheaply constructed.,"I feel this product is cheaply made. It's very light and doesn't have a sturdy feel to it. Also, at one point one of the legs completely disconnected from the main connecting point on top when moving it. Luckily I didn't have my camera attached at the time. I would not recommend this product."
5,Buen tripie,"Es manejable de buena altura dificil de encontrar en México, más bien aquí no hay, es muy lijero, facil de transportar,"
2,I give up!,"I have tried 4 recipes from Cupcakes Galore and I am now convinced that I must stop! As a semi-pro home baker I use high quality ingredients (organic eggs, Irish butter, top shelf liquor) and my results have been consistently disappointing to the point where I am throwing away most of every batch. Each recipe has been bland or one-dimensional. I can appreciate the lack of cloying sweetness--these aren't doctored cake mixes--but I cannot get past the unpleasant texture of all the cupcakes. A heavy cake with a coarse crumb seems to be Wagman's preference, which doesn't work well in a small package. These recipes seem to be more suited for rustic loaf or bundt-style coffee cakes. I love to tinker with recipes, but hers all need more time than I am willing to invest to produce results. I'll keep the book around for the photographs because I like her decorating style, but I am now convinced her recipes aren't for me."
1,No flavor and dry,"I was so excited when I bought this book, but after making two recipes I clearly wasted my money. The recipes sound yummy but the cupcakes come out dry and have no taste to them. These recipes clearly were not tested and the author should be disappointed in this book. I really enjoy making cupcakes and would love to find a cupcake book with tested recipes so I know they will turn out good."
1,Tacky and outdated,"I returned this book after flipping through it. The recipes seem bizarre and the decorating ideas are distractingly tacky. I would strongly recommend Hello, Cupcake or Martha Steward Cupcakes over this outdated book."
1,Dry cupcakes,"This book is very colorful and pretty, with great photos of the cupcakes. But I baked the chocolate hazelnut cupcakes yesterday, following the recipe precisely, and they were incredibly dry. I was extremely disappointed. I actually threw out most of the cupcakes because it's not worth wasting the calories. I'd have been better off using Betty Crocker mix from the box!"
2,Pretty pictures... but it ends there,"The book includes many beautiful pictures, but the cupcakes are pretty much meant for their looks. If you are looking for an exellent cupcake book, go out and get the cake doctor book. It has excellent ideas. All of the cupcakes are creative and interesting, but nothing i would go out and immediately make."
5,Cupcakes Yum!!!!,"I bought this book because I am into this ""cupcakes"" phase...hehe, Gail Wagman shows you can decorate cupcakes in a unique way, hey the sky's the limit!!! Buy this book, folks!!!"
1,Very disappointing,"Being an avid baker, I was given this cookbook as a gift from a coworker, and I couldn't be more disappointed in the actual taste of these recipes. I've now tried four or five of them, and each batch has been inedible. I think I have LITERALLY thrown away every single batch (which is probably the only reason I am even writing this review). The first ones I tried, just a vanilla cupcake, I thought I had maybe done something wrong, so I made them AGAIN and the results were just as unfavorable. The cupcakes are dry and flavorless. Even though a lot of the recipes look really good, I'm afraid to waste any more of my time and money trying out recipes that I could end up tossing in the garbage."
5,"Beautiful, moist & delicious cupcakes!","As a big cupcake fan since childhood-- I still stand in line at the trendy Magnolia bakery every time I'm in NYC--I found Cupcakes Galore to be a fabulous inspiration for decorating cupcakes, and the best source I have found for making moist, delicious cakes that are the foundation for the fabulous frostings. I love the tips from a pro and the book is presented in a very playful, yet passionate way--the author obviously loves baking. It's super for both the simple cupcakes-with-frosting of my childhood and for the many fantasy cupcakes for special occasions. Great layout and photos, too! Out of the many cupcake books that are suddenly around, think this is the best I've seen."
2,"Pretty pictures, awful recipes","This cookbook is quite pretty, pictures are lovely, nice glossy pages but....the recipes are just plain and often awful. Like many of the other reviews these are tasteless recipes. Most of them the amount of time and cost to icing 24 individual cupcakes you could just purchase them at a bakery and save yourself hours worth of work. The Hot Chocolate and Marshmallow cupcake just calls for making dark chocolate cupcakes (which were way too dry) and then toasting marshmallows and putting them on top as the icing. What?!If you need a cupcake cookbook purchase the Cake Doctor Cupcakes by Anne Byrn. It's well worth the money, this cookbook is not. Just go to the library and borrow it because you will want to return it afterward."
3,Be careful when you order this title,I ordered this title and received a home made copy on DVD (copied from a VHS) instead of the original as released by Gotham. Be careful.
5,Great film,This was a great film with great acting and it makes one FEEL as if your in Victorian England. A jolly good time!!
3,Tom Brown's School Days,"A coming of age movie. It reminds me of growing up and the right of passage all young men go through.I still like ""The Happy Years"" the best, but I have been unable to find this movie. You sent to me what I thought was The Happy Years in a three DVD set, but I was disappointed to learn it was not one of the three."
3,Tom Brown,"I cannot rate this correctly, just took a guess...as not yet viewed. Have been too busy. Freddie Bartholomew was one of my early childhood heros, so wanted to view this. Will as able. Ill family member, have my hands full right now. Sorry."
4,"Really long tubing, does what it needs to do","Bought this to use with medical students in my Physical Diagnosis small groups. Comes in handy when the students aren't sure what they are hearing and we can listen together. The tubing is quite long compared to a traditional stethoscope. Because of that the sounds are not as clear as you would get using a good quality ""one user"" stethoscope. (Thus the 4 star rating.) However it is fine for teaching the basics to pre-clinical students. (A suggestion for use - pick which color ear piece you will always use and make the students use the other one so that you have one side adjusted to yourself, and only dirty with your own earwax.)"
3,Very Good,"This book came in later that was expected. It took about four weeks to arrive, which the due date to come in was three weeks after order. I needed this book for my college class and received it 3 days after my class started."
1,I did not receive my item so far,I did not receive my item so far. For this reason I can not evaluate the product but the vendor is the worse I've been know. I recommend AMAZON exclude NORTHERN TOOLS as AMAZON supplier.
2,"Bad ""Acting"" Spoils This Presentation","Sadly, the reader attempts to emote while reading the Psalms. Theoretically that's not a bad idea; it's just that he obviously has no clue as to the meaning and feeling of the Psalms. His presentation is outright harsh THROUGHOUT the entire Book of Psalms. He even managed to make Psalm 139 completely lose its intimacy and gratitude. The inappropriate contradictory feeling he puts into the Psalms is a big distraction from trying to meditate on and understand the text. It's so bad that I no longer use this compilation at all."
1,Ripoff Book,"Unfortunately, Galatoire's Cookbook is little more than a ripoff of books and articles that have previously been published. Many of the recipes reflect those in Leon Galatoire's cookbook (as a member of the revered restaurant family, he was in a position to know the material first hand); and much of the copy seems to be lifted from an earlier work, Galatoire's: Biography of a Bistro. Although the book is slickly framed in a beautiful cover, it offers nothing new for those familiar with the venerable instution on Bourbon Street, and for those who know and love the Creole bistro, it offers nothing, save annoyance.Avoid this book."
3,Wrong sizes,I received these candle holders as a Christmas gift. They are really pretty BUT they were the same size. The product description and picture states that one is taller than the other. I wish they had been shipped as described b/c now they look weird being the same size and I want what was ordered.
4,Pleased,"Bought these as a gift, everyone said they liked them and the quality was great for the price. What more could you want?"
5,Discover your intellectual roots!,"I'd heard Nash's book referred to many times but avoided reading it because I thought I knew the modern history of conservative thought fairly well. I was wrong. Just as attending law school taught me I didn't know nearly as much about the Constitution as I thought I did, reading Nash taught me I didn't know nearly as much about 20th century conservatism as I'd believed. If you're a conservative, it's thrilling to watch the movement grow from a tiny group with little status into a powerful force capable of electing a president. It's also very practical because you can see the supporting structures of a movement develop through alternative institutions and endowed professor's chairs. Become a total conservative wonk-geek who will understand most of the oblique references you've read in National Review. Read this book."
2,There are better books ou there.,"I am a true blue conservative, but this book left me wanting more. The time period it covers is 1945-1973ish... But the conservative movement was still in its infancy during that time period. Its insights weren't that great. It ignores a lot of the big trends.I recommend Right Nation and Upstream."
5,"Elegant, spectacular, real classy classic.","Let's set aside the monster cast in this recording. All of them sing with a great theatrical performance. Powerful and charming singing. Ms. Bonney is one of my favorite sopranos, and the legend Gruberová is as great as she's always been. But the issue in this recording is Maestro Harnoncourt and the Royal Concertgebouw. Altogether,offer us a new, fresh, elegant and spectaular recording with a sound (allow me to remark: a sound, what a sound!) seldom herd in some others fine recordings. Harnoncourt's reading is so meticolous that changes and challenges all Die Fledermaus recordings I have listened to. Even tho' the Kleiber DG DVD recording is one the greatest ever, I do not mind having both recordings.Bravo Maestro!"
4,Great sound,I installed this muffler on a 3.5 V6 and it sounds great. It has a rumble like a V8 now instead of a can with bees in it.
1,It Doesn't Work!,I agree with some customers. This product is a waist of money. It doesn't do anything for your lashes. They look exactly the same before and after using this curler!
4,It works!,"Great product. For lasting effect, I use it after curling my lashes and mascara. It really works!"
4,No more torture devices yay!,"I love my lashes curled but I never found a mechanical curler that didn't pinch or pull lashes or create fake looking curls. Once you get the hang of this heated curler you will use it every day. The natural looking curl lasts very well if you are using mascara - apply mascara first then curl! one star off because this thing uses up batteries like crazy, and there is no auto magic shut off so if you forget to turn it off that's a battery down the tubes. I am going to invest in rechargeable though, that's how much I love this thing!"
1,Hate it,"I've used a lot of eyelash curlers and this one sounded interesting, but it really does nothing. If I work at it for a very long time, I may see a little difference in my lashes, but a metal curler works way better and much faster."
5,excellent for long unruly lashes,"I'm an avid user of an eyelash curlers. I just got this gadget a few days ago and this heated curler is excellent. I have long unruly lashes and this little gadget gets them into shape and into a very pretty curl. I also love panasonic's eyebrow trimmer.To properly use the curler, allow it to heat up and use it as you would use a hot iron to curl hair, pausing for about 3 seconds for each section of the eye lashes."
1,Not good for short asian eyelashes!,"This is soo hard to use, and it probably works way better on a person with longer lashes. Other than that, it heats up fast and curls after a hundred strokes on my short asian lashes."
1,Be Afraid... Be Very Afraid,"Panasonic has a great reputation... but for TV's and other electronics. The reviews ran the gamut, so I decided the price was worth gambling I would finally find the eyelash curler of my dreams. One reviewer mentioned the curler is flat, and that's correct; it's shaped like a little toothbrush. So you can envision the problem with that: If you have George Clooney lashes, no problem. If you have short, straight lashes like me (which is why I use a curler in the first place), BIG PROBLEM! It's not only scary to put a hot mini-iron so close to your corneas, but just not worth the risk of a slip-up."
1,good till it stopped heating up,"I bought this heated curler because my traditional eyelash curler was breaking off my lashes. The Panasonic did curl my lashes (although not as much as a regular eyelash curler). It was also good for unclumping mascara. Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks it barely heated up. Changed the battery and no difference. I ended up returning it."
2,Not much curl,"Well, it technically does curl your lashes but not very much. You have to hold it on for 1 minute to get anything. Then you need to apply mascara or something right away in order to keep any curl. I haven't used it more than once since I got it. Not very happy with this product."
3,No crimping!,The curler works very well and is easy to use and clean. The only negative is that the directions say not to use rechargeable batteries and the battery needs to be replaced at least twice a month.
2,"Not that effective, wouldnt recommend!","I would not recommend this product. It takes a lot of time to heat up, and I hear that if you leave the batteries in then it will drain the battery juice, so it takes a lot of hassle taking out the battery after each use.Anyways, on my eyelashes, it takes so much time to have the heat fully penetrate the lashes and you have to swipe it along your eyelashes multiple multiple times, for each eye! I personally don't have time to do that every day unless it was for a special occasion and I spend extra time heating up my eyelashes. I personally would just stick to the traditional eye lash curler for now."
2,Lasted six weeks-what a disappointment!,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas-she loved it! It did everything advertised...for about six weeks. The heater stopped working, even though she tried multiple battery changes. Of course, the return date expired ten days before the product did... : ("
4,Works on bare lashes too!,"I used to have one of these a long time ago but never had good results. I think I might have actually thrown it away whilst cleaning out old makeup. Really glad I gave it another shot! The wider comb attachment that goes over the heating element makes it much easier to use in my opinion. I still use my Shu Uemura curler first and then follow up with the heated one to set the curl. The result is pretty, upswept lashes that make mascara application much easier and more effective. The best part is it really maximizes the lengthening and volumizing properties of any mascara I use. Love it!"
3,so-so product,The curler ONLY curl eyelashes for a few hours...and the battery is not so good either....
3,Just so so,I bought it and tried to make my eyelash curler. Maybe I am not good at it. The result is so so.
1,Terrible,This is a terrible product. It did not heat up nor curl the eyelashes. I had to go and purchase a different one within 2 days. Would not recommend to anyone.
1,Heat Setting Is Too Low!!!,I wish there was a higher heat setting because it's way too low and takes FOREVER to curve my lashes. Wow. Horrible.
2,I loved it til it stopped working....,"I was in love with this curler it heated very well the first couple of weeks, but now it barely heats, and if I want to return it I have to pay the shipment. I'm sooo dissapointed!!"
2,"Panasonic EH2351AC Heated Eyelash Curler, Blue",I bought this after reading the positive reviews but sadly it did not work for me. I do have thick eyelashes though but I would leave them under my lashes for 20 seconds to no avail.
3,Needs batteries...a lot,"I've used this a few times before doing a review. I'm still on the fence on whether or not I'll keep using it. Here are my thoughts.PROS:1) heats up fast2) gets really hot3) does curl your lashes (I have asian lashes, so it took a few swipes)CONS:1) uses up batteries. It took awhile for my lashes to curl the way I like them. I think that if your eyelashes are already curly, you would save a little bit of batter power. But it won't be by much. For me, it's almost one battery per one and half usage.So in all, it's not a bad little tool, if I had the time to use it. I think I'm just so used to my manual eyelash curler (Shu Emura) that I find that using this is a little tedious."
4,"Works, small learning curve...","People that this sort of heated curler is NOT working for are probably not using it right. Using this device intails a learning curve to get it right, and the instructions it comes with are rather basic and poor. Once you play with it, and get the angles right, it really does work well, particularly if you use clear mascara, or a primer, before curling. I can get a little bit more dramatic of a curl curve with my traditional eyelash curler, but I often pinch my lid, and it's just more of a PITA...! This unit can get a teeny bit hot near your delicate lid skin, but you quickly get used to it. Check out EnKore Makeup's video on YouTube for a great instructional video on using heated eyelash curlers. It REALLY, really helped me to start using this thing faster..."
3,Over-hyped.,"I got it based on a YouTube review by a beauty guru. Her lashes were amazing and long; almost fake-looking. I have long lashes myself; and was looking forward tot he noticeable progression of length. It didn't occur. Don't misunderstand, the product was working. The purple turns to pink when it heats up and blah-blah-blah. It just didn't produce a difference. I was better off spending the money I bought this with on some new mascara.Hope this helps. ^.^"
5,Read the stats folks... know what your getting,"Read the recommended age and stop bashing it because you bought one for your 8 year old!!! This thing is hilarious, everyone should buy one."
3,It's a toy but not for kids,Parents should always read the description before purchasing any item for kids. Don't blame the seller. Be a responsible parent and read the description....it clearly states for ages 18 and over.
2,Stopped working,"It is poor quality. Doesn't last long, only 2 times playing it , it died. Would not recommend buying it."
2,Sluggish and Repetitive,"First published in 1984, this effort begins but soon becomes predictable and all suspense is lost. It held an interesting premise and the ghostly parallel layer of Manhattan is compelling. However, the main character and those around him fail to drive the plot. The dead are just plainly uninteresting. What I did enjoy were the descriptions of New York and its neighborhoods of thirty years ago."
2,Slow from the start - and it stays that way.,"I found A MANHATTAN GHOST STORY boring. The first ten pages were pretty good, but after a while the story turned slow and pretty passive. I did't like this at all. It so sad, because the author could've done something brillant with this. I finished reading it with a sigh and that was it."
2,"Dumas US Navy PT109 33""","When i opened the box the plastic bag for the hardware (cleats, gun parts, etc...) had been cut open and the parts were scattered all over. I have not yet inventoried, but Not happy that the contents had been tampered with."
2,Not as good as the earlier Bicycle Games,"The bells and whistles, and the silly avatars don't enhance the games on this new Bicycle card games. The solitaire selections are less interesting than the first Bicycle solitaire, and my favorites, Spider and Forty Thieves are missing. One of the games doesn't work at all, and some are quite awkward."
2,Don't buy this game for the bridge..,"unless you are a glutton for punishment. You will be consistently dealt many bad hands. You will see many 4 - 6 point hands before you see one over 12. A quick survey of ten hands showed 7 hands with under 15 points between my partner and myself. As a result, you will be thrashed by your computer opponent. They give you three levels, easy, intermediate, and hard. You get the same bad hands with all. I don't see the difference.In addition, your partner provide many insane bids. Very frustrating.And its all too bad because the graphics are great, the presentation is logical, and even the music is good.Its like they do a good job with everything but the card playing part.It makes you wish they would come out with a new, upgraded version.jwrit"
2,Spider,"I enjoyed playing Spider on a friend's computer -- the game came with the XP version of windows. I looked for a copy of the game so I could play it. If that's what you're looking for, I'd suggest buying Hoyle's Card Games. It has Spider, as well as at least 25 other varations of solitaire. I enjoy this product much more! :)"
3,Where are the solitaire games,I like the way you can choose your own avatar. The music in the back ground is nice.I just thought I'd be getting more than one solitaire game and there's no poker either.
4,Wide selection of card games,This is a great product that offers a wide array of games. I have never seen spite and malice in a computer game before. I just wish the game kept running statics and that individual games had more adjustable options to tailor the games to suit your pleasure. Over all smashing.
1,I'm trying to find the Spider Game!,I'm glad I read your reviews!I read that this game DOES NOT include the Spider Game!
1,No Gasket Included,Be warned. This item does not include a gasket like nearly every other transmission filter. Gasket sells for $18 on amazon. Better off buying the duralast version at autozone.
2,Didn't Do the Job,"Unfortunately, this one couldn't stand up to the job for me, anyway. Every other Panasonic product I've used has been excellent."
4,"Blades aren't very sharp, but it works great on soft hair","This is definitely more for ""peach fuzz"" than coarse hair, but that's probably a given. Works well enough, but it's nothing special."
3,Does not do the job for facial hair.,This trimmer is ok for longer hair trimming but does not do well on unwanted facial hair. I would not recommend it.
4,Just what I was looking for,"Since I had chemo treatments and lost most of my hair, when it did start coming back, it came in heavy and dark. I tried using the creams to remove the facial hair but they tended to make my face turn red and burned my skin. I got this and it does the job without the redness. I could use it everyday if needed. Worth giving a try."
1,I hate it,"I don't know why I bought this. Previously, I owned the Finishing Touch, and I liked it. After using it for a couple of years, I dropped it, and broke it to smithereens. For some reason, I bought this one as a replacement. I guess I thought it might be better. It's not!It does do the job for which it is made. However, it is so cheaply made - there is no weight to it. It's hard to put together. And, it won't stay together. After using it a few times, I threw it away, and went back to the Finishing Touch. Don't waste your money."
3,Love it BUT,"Great product I am often very caught with time, school and all so this is a great way to get my eyebrows done quick and easy no pain no delays I love it. The thing is though that it really doesn't look like u just did your eyebrows it looks more like you did them a couple of days before since the hair looks as if it was starting to grow. Most of the time I don't minded since I am not going to anywhere special but school. Certainly wouldn't use it for a major party but what can I say it gets the job done and for that I love it"
4,Does the job,"This product works well, but it takes practice to get it right. It must be used very carefully, or you end up taking off more of your eyebrow than you anticipated.It works well - but be careful!"
5,LOVE IT!,"This product is amazing! I have gone through many trimmers that you can buy at the drug store for $9.99. This product does not compare because it is not in the same ballpark as those cheap things! I LOVE THIS TRIMMER! I used it for the first time this morning and it works beautifuly. This trimmer is powerful, yet does not hurt the skin in anyway. It is super easy and super quick. I will use it everyday during my morning routine to keep my face nice and smooth. I am very excited about this purchase and would definitely recommend it!"
1,missing piece,"The panasonic pivoting facial trimmer contains two head - one for facial hair and one for eyebrows. The package I received today was missing half of the eyebrow head?!?! Like missing a plastic plate to cover the parts... so the attachments don't fit, screws are hanging out. I will return it if I cannot get a response from this complaint."
1,Save your money,I was extremely disappointed. This is a glorified mini-razor and doesn't work as well. Don't bother. Save your money. I highly don't recommend!
1,Does not do the job,"Received feedback that the original review was unhelpful, so adding a bit more detail.The main issue: Even after going over the same area repeatedly, the results are unsatisfactory. Skin feels irritated, but not smooth.Construction seems flimsy, but I did not keep the product long enough to know if it would soon break. Still, the reason for returning the product was the issue mentioned above.Note: Seller, FrozenLemon, handled return/refund promptly. Unfortunately I was unable to add this on the Seller's site, so want to say something here. Though this product did not work out, I would definitely order from this seller again."
1,Very poor product,The trimmer comes in two pieces and will not work properly. The pieces come apart and is impossible to use. I am returning this product. I expected much more for over $15!
4,"Okay not great, annoyances listed","It's slightly better then the generic you will pick up at wall mart but I have the following annoyances.1) It's more powerful than other models so this is a bonus but it should be even more powerful.2) The eye brow trimmer ONLY pops on with a specific blade making it a pain to put on.3) This model comes with two heads, one is too long for my use and the other is too short."
1,Flimsy,Cuts only finest peach fuzz hairs. Will not cut pubes. Only use is to trim eyebrows. Would just not rccomend.
5,Great product!,"This product completely met all of my expectations! It's a great product that gets the job done. I've read other reviews about the battery not lasting very long, but it really doesn't take long to run the little ""blades"" over the areas that tend to get a little hairy... takes less than a minute, so the battery isn't an issue for me. Give it a try!"
5,Good,"I like it. Small, portable, cute, and easy to use. It got the job done and I'm happy to have it. It was also affordable."
5,Love it!,I am really hpapy with this little product! I am also grateful to all the reviewers who loved it. All this blond peach fuzz (where on earth does it come from?) makes me crazy. This cute little pink tool makes fast work of it!
2,Not that effective,"The overwhelming 5 star reviews is what helped me decide to choose this trimmer. But it's so not worth the price. It does work on trimming hair that is more than a quarter of an inch, but if you are looking for a closer trim - this item is not for you.Positives - its sleek, and very quiet."
2,Careful! Use oil to protect your skin!,"The first few times I used this trimmer, all was well. My fuzz (I had a lot) disappeared painlessly and I couldn't be happier.However, I soon developed bumps all over my cheeks, and they rapidly turned into painful red spots. I tried to remove these spots with lotions and cleansers and, after becoming even more irritated, my skin developed dark scars.Now I have bumps under the scars and my skin on my lower cheeks near my jawline is just a mess.I've since stopped using the trimmer, and I'm taking care of my skin over there. It's getting better, but slowly, because I have dark skin and the dark marks stay for longer.ADVICE: Use an oil like tea tree oil (great for pimples, too!) to protect your skin as you trim hair. Never use on dry skin, because you could irritate it. Don't be left with horrible scarring like me."
4,Did someone forget to mention,"Since in all the reviews no one mentioned the down side to shaving off your peach fuzz, I will. I have very fine fuzz on my face, you can't really see it but I thought makeup would go on better if I removed it. I knew I should have tested a small area, I guess everyone assumed you would know if you shave it off, you are going to have stubble. So now my face feels like very fine sandpaper. I will not be doing this again. Can not wait to get back to a smooth, soft, peach fuzz face. Having said that, I do love the eyebrow attachments and I am sure it would be great to shave small problem areas. That's the only reason I gave it four stars, I was under the impression it would be good for the whole face, peach fuzz and all. For now, I'll just be like one of the guys."
1,Piece of Crap,"It doesn't work! Aside for the fact that the instructions are INCREDIBLY long-winded and confusing, when I finally figured out that all I had to do was put in a AAA battery and ... nothing happened. I checked and double checked. The polarization is right, I cleaned the contacts twice. I don't know what else could possibly be wrong other the product itself just being flawed."
3,Average,This product is nothing special. It does cut facial hair but it takes several times to remove it and does not cut it close enough to the skin.
1,"Didn't Work For Me, At All","I tried this facial trimmer. It didn't work for me at all. I would think that if it did work for someone it would have to be someone who has very fine hair.This is a useless product, at least it was for me!I did read the reviews before I purchased it. Sounded good. It wasn't!"
2,painfull,Its ok for triming very small fine peach fuz under nose or areas around cheeks but anything slightyly longer like eye brows and it pulls and rips out your hair its painfull. And the whole reason i bought it was for my brows... but it rips out the hairs and its very unpleasent. may aswell keep waxing my brows cause the pain is about the same :/
1,Waste of money!,"Other than a nice sculptural shape and small, this was utterly worthless, doing nothing but making a noise. I cannot imagine how it even got on the market. It might be good for scaring a spider on the edge of the bathroom sink; but nothing more."
2,Not Necessary,I find this product basically not necessary in my arsenal against facial hair. Many other less expensive products that one normally has does as well as this. I was frankly disappointed and it only came with one blade for general grooming leaving out the eyebrow blade which is actually my purpose in buying it.
3,works,This works good but it just isn't my favorite trimmer for ladies. I intend to go back to my old one for certain things and this one for others. I got this for the things the other couldn't quite do that this can which is odd for they are so similar.
1,Not impressed.,There is nothing good about this item. I feel it was a waste of money. I would not buy it again.
4,Very comfortable,This little shaver is the most comfortable and non-abrasive of the different pen-type shavers I've used. The pivoting head is probably what makes it better than the others. It does seem to shave a little closer also. I like this product although it seems slightly over-priced considering the thin plastic that it is made of.
2,Inefficient,I found the Panasonic pivoting facical trimmer pulled rather than cut the hair efficientlyly. I also would question its power source. One little AAA battery probably would not power the unit very long.
1,Worthless for coarse hair,Totally unable to use on eyebrows etc because the hair is too coarse. This is really intended for fine facial hair on females.
4,I like it,"I like this trimmer, however it doesn't cut very close. I am also hesitant to use it on my eyebrows. If your looking for a trim it's a good buy, but if your looking for more a close shave,look elsewhere."
5,Best Trimmer EVER !,Love love love this item! I have had several other trimmers in the past and this by far is the most precise!
2,Good idea with major flaw,"This pencil-sized facial hair groomer - for those tiny hairs you wish you didn't have - is intended to be an improvement, and hence more expensive, than its predecessors. This one features a ""swiveling"" head. Yes, the head swivels - but then falls off even with the most delicate motion. You could say that it's a kind of exercise machine, because the user is always bending over and picking it up, reinserting the head on its stick, and starting the whole process over again. So I vote NO on this one, and returned it, opting for the stationery, cheaper, and more reliable kind."
1,All It Removed Was My Money,"I've used the Finishing Touch for hair removal before and have always been pleased with it. But this time when I needed to buy a new one, I saw the Panasonic Pivoting Head Facial Groomer. The fact that it pivoted is what sold me. Boy was I wrong! First of all, the Panasonic doesn't have the power that the Finishing Touch does and you can't press it hard when you need to. The big problem was that when I changed the blades the second time, the locking mechanism simply broke off. Although both devices are made with plastic, the Panasonic is made with a much cheaper grade of plastic, and that is why the locking mechanism broke--it was plainly too flimsy to last. I'm happy that some others have had no problems with their Panasonics, but I won't chance it again."
5,WORKS AWESOME!!**,"Very impressed!! Tried tons of these and this is the BEST by far - trims those ""little persistent pains"" here and there close like a blade ->that still come back even after years of Electrolysis & sure helps BIG time with those high treatment bills!! Gets rid of peach fuzz that shows even after bleaching and still grows back soft later - that's a major plus in itself!! Very happy with it and highly recommend!!"
1,Beware of dark spots!,"I am a dark skinned indian girl cursed with black, thick facial hair. I bought this to use while I went away to school to keep my eye brows trimmed and my upper lip, chin, and cheek hair free. My mom noticed that on all the areas where I was using this, my skin was starting to develop dark, shadowy spots (similar to a guy after shaving). I stopped using it every where besides trimming my eye brows (careful about over doing it though). The dark spots are taking a LONG time to go away but now I thread and tweeze. Please do note that this is my personal experience and it could just be my skin that had this type of a reaction. It could also be something else entirely."
4,Needs extra blades,"This is a nice product. I have bought several both for myself and friends. The one complaint I have is that there is no extra blade for the shaver. This would be easy to replace and extend the product's life. However, that may be the point."
2,Not for me,"Does very nicely are fine, downy hair. Didn't do well for my chin hair which is a little more coarse. The ""motor"" gave out fairly soon even after battery changes."
2,Meh,"Pretty disappointed mainly because the attachments are confusing and not intuitive, furthermore the instructions are impossible to follow so I've basically put all the attachments away. It says it comes with a carrying case to hold all the pieces - and there are a lot of attachments - but no carry case was included. Also there is no pivoting action yet it's listed as a selling point. I don't think I want something that trims my eyebrows to easily pivot anyway. I'm also slightly annoyed that it's girly pink and somewhat resembles a vibrator. Similar items for men are much better designed with superior functionality. I will buy a men's trimmer next time."
1,Panasonic Trimmer,"I was forced to return this product for the following reasons below:First of all, it was packaged in a hard plastic case and I was forced to use a sharp knife to even open the package. Then I discovered the product was missing a piece (which looked to be broken off before packaging). Needless to say, I could not assemble it with a part missing, therefore it was useless.I bought this product because of the high ratings. Why couldn't the manufacturer have put it together before shipping, then they would notice if a part was missing?? I was forced to put the cheap plastic bits and pieces in a plastic bag for the return. I will think twice before purchasing another product like this. It was discounted and now I know why, cheap, cheap, cheap!I am a good customer of Amazon and will have to say they are very good about refunds and exchanges on defective products. That's why I continue to order from Amazon."
2,NOT A NOSE HAIR TRIMMER,"This trimmer is for long eye brows and such. Not for nose, as blades only run along side, not top. It's kind of light and cheaply made, too."
4,Woman's shaver,"Like it a lot. Still need to wax my upper lip but it's great, great on cheek and neck facial hair. I've waited a long time for something this good!! I would recommend it to anyone who has more than usual cheek hair."
3,Not as expected,"very disappointed in the performance of this trimmer. It doesn't shave as close and like another reviewer, had to go over the same area several times."
3,"Works ok, but not great.","This product does help remove facial hair, and trims your eyebrows, but it leaves quite a few hair left over and doesn't work as well as i hoped it would. Im still glad i bought this product because it works well for those flyaway hairs, but if you want a professional looking eyebrow job, go to the salon instead."
2,Not as good as previous models,This little shaver is not as good as the older Panasonic ones. It is mostly plastic and seems flimsy. It doesn't seem to work as well either. The older ones had battery covers that would not stay on however. I probably need to try another brand. I use this to remove mustache fuzz.
4,"Great unit, but the blade...","It does what it's supposed to do and it works great, but the blade seems to have dulled pretty quickly. Maybe it's because I used it on my boyfriend's more rough beard a little, but that was only 2 times. The blade feels much duller than it did when I first got it, and I haven't really gotten heavy use out of it. But I still like it, and would still buy replacement blades, but I wish I could buy higher quality ones."
4,"Not a close shave, but","As I've grown older, and taking hormone blockers to keep away a recurrence of breast cancer, my facial hair has become quite coarse. I bought this item to trim in between hair removal laser treatments. I don't give it a 5 star rating because the shaving is not super close, but it works fine for me."
5,Great Groomer,"I bought this to trim up my eyebrows and some unwanted facial hair after losing my other trimmer. I didn't even know Panasonic made a trimmer. I'm glad that I lost my previous trimmer. This trims really close, comes with an eyebrow blade and two brow trimmer accessories. Although I paid more than twice than my previous trimmer, it's well worth the price. This product does what it should do. I'm ordering two more for family members."
4,Great!,"I love this product! I was hesitant at first, because I didn't want a rough shaved looked, but it works great for touch ups. The eyebrow part is good for cleanup, but takes a little more skill."
5,Excellent !,"By far the best facial trimmer I have ever used. It does everything it says, an excellent trimmer for women on the go and traveling!"
4,An Great Product,"I bought this product primarily just to get rid of the facial hair I get around my upper lip. For that purpose, this product is wonderful and painless. Just for that I would give this product 5 stars.The groomer also does eyebrows, but I found the mechanism for doing the eyebrows to be way to much trouble to go through. If I were to rate the product on that, I would give only 3 stars.I would say if you're looking to get rid facial hair in general, then this is for you. If you're looking for something to sculp your eyebrows, try something else."
4,This is great for peach fuzz but not coarse hair.,I have very blonde peach fuzz on my face and using this does remove it and it comes back just the same as peach fuzz..thank goodness. It however doesn't cut those coarse rare chin hairs as I had hoped. I still kept it as makeup loos so good on the smooth skin.
5,Still kicking after two years!,This facial trimmer is great and still working several years after purchase. It's great for quickly shaping brows when you don't have time for tweezers.
2,Doesn't work well,I don't think this product works well. I have to run it back and forth over my eyebrows several times before i feel like it's trimmed even a few hairs.
3,Panasonic Facial Groomer,"It's pretty good but only is effective on ""peach fuzz."" I don't remember the product description but it could be accurate. In any event, I needed one that's a tad more powerful. It is easy to use and very effective on some areas."
5,Best I've Ever Had!!,"This little razor is a dream! It is incredibly gentle and doesn't cause ingrown hairs or red bumps, it is by far the best personal trimmer I have ever owned!"
4,Just a great little trimmer,This so far has been just great. I have used it on my face in different areas and even had to use it on a few stray hairs on the front of my leg that I missed. I think it does a nice job and super glad I bought it.
1,Don't waste your money!,"This product is not worth the money. It did not cut anything but the finest, softest hairs, and even then it didn't work well. It missed a lot of hairs and I had to keep going over the area again and again. The blades are too dull. For $17 bucks I expected more.I have one made by Braun, that I got as a freebie for buying another Braun product over three years ago, and it still works as if it were new. I bought this Panasonic one thinking the curved handle would make it more comfortable, and it is comfortable to hold, it's just that the blades couldn't cut through melted butter!Save your money for another brand."
2,Be careful not to trim your eyelashes off!,"Word to the wise, be extra careful when trimming your eyebrows. The head is so long that I accidentally trimmed my eyelashes! Not the look I was going for.(The mini head broke, which is why I was attempting this with the big head)."
1,Pretty but Pointless,The trimmer is light-weight and easy to carry but it does not trim anything. I've tried various lengths and both of the attachable heads and it does not work. Does not trim anything. I ended up just using it as an electrical shaver without attachments. (sometimes it pulls hair a bit
2,Very disappointed!!,"I bought this to replace my Remington that I've had for a long time. The reviews were good. It doesn't work like my Remington. I am extremely disappointed. I miss my Remington and will buy another Remington. :( It doesn't get the hair that it claims and people have raved about. I have to get my Remington out to finish the job. Usually the reviews are accurate, but not this time."
3,"It does the job, but with flaws.","I use this for my eyebrows. Has a great battery life. It does work, but I'm always left over with the base of the hair. Not as close of a shave as I'd like. If I try to press down a little harder to get the remains, then it just ends up pulling the hair and causing a good deal of pain, and I still end up with unwanted hair. I have to shave about every 3 days or so with it. Overall, I would not suggest buying this product for tougher hair such as eyebrows unless you're just doing a tiny amount of shaving. It works well on fuzz and thin hairs but other than that, I think i'll try waxing next time."
1,Not as pictured,"This item is actually the anti-dust chalk and not traditional chalk as pictured. I wanted it for a home remedy for grease stains and couldn't find anything but the anti-dust chalk in stores. This was more but I was excited to see it was still available.Item was shipped direct to my home from a major warehouse club based in Arkansas. The receipt inside said it was 68 cents with free shipping.So, I didn't get what was pictured. It was shipped by a retailer rather than the seller and I paid three times as much. I will be more thorough researching next time or only buy items actually sold by Amazon."
4,It's just Chalk LOL,It's just chalk. I purchased it to write and decorate come chalk board contact paper. They still break very easily.
4,very stylish!,Thought my pup could use an upgrade as her old collar was gettin a little long in the tooth. This collar is durable and comfortable and the charm really sets it off. My one complaint is that the excess length would stick straight out but i tamed it with some cleverly placed silly bands and now I would say it looks quite fetching.
3,Not quite expected,"I was expecting the sealed package as described and pictured. What I received was a battery in a clear bag. I could have bought the same battery for cheaper if I knew that was going to happen. The battery did work however, and didn't bother to exchange it."
2,not original packaging,"It works OK buy it does not come as ""OEM Sealed Battery in Original Motorola Retail Packaging"". I hope it is so."
2,Received Not As Advertised,"I received the battery in a stapled plastic bag. It was not an OEM product as advertised!!! Will use until my cell phone burns up from a ""knock-off"" product. The price paid is not worth pursuing a return. I guess that is what the seller hopes."
2,Didn't come in package,I was expecting a package sealed product and receive a battery in a bag. I would not have bought it if I knew before hand.
2,Battery appears not to be new,The battery has the same problem - immediately going to low after a phone call - that the old two-year-used battery did. :-(
1,Didn't work,"Purchased this battery for my Razr V3, but the battery would not work. It continually asked for a SIM card to be put in. However, the SIM card was already in place. I bought the exact same battery from another company, and it works great. But I have to say that they had an excellent return program, and they gave me a complete refund."
3,Bad battery,"Price was great, but battery only last less than 30 days. When played in phone is charges well and after a few charges it doesn't last long.George. Staten Island, NY"
4,"Great Songs,but False Advertising","This cd is avertised on the back cover as having a Bonus dvd,but there is no dvd.Beware! Love Jaci's music, all the songs are great.Update on the bouns dvd, March 10, 2006Reviewer: video rock (maryland) - See all my reviewsI found a dealer that had the cd with the dvd included.The first package that I stated that did not have the dvd was factory sealed,and stated on the back that the dvd was included,so there must be some cd's out there that have been misspackaged by the distributor Sony Music. If you are looking for the dvd packaged cd you can inquire from the dealer if the dvd is included with the cd. Hope this helps for those like myself who are looking for the included dvd with this cd."
1,Bad. Avoid.,"This is the second and final CD for this short-lived Polish Black Metal group that was only around from 1997-1999. A side project of Cezar of Christ Agony and the late Doc (died 2005) of Vader, they have a sound that sounds to me like a poor and uninspired imitation of Emperor. Add to this some lyrics written in poor English that often don't make sense, which are sung with a heavy accent which makes them even more difficult to understand. Nothing worthy of note here. I found even one listen a waste of time.I'm glad I just picked this up pretty cheap used so I don't mind the little bit of money I spent taking a chance on an unknown new group. But I really wouldn't recommend this to anybody except maybe those who want to collect any group that even remotely reminds them of Emperor. Otherwise I'd say pass."
1,Very bad product,If your money and time are important to you do not buy this product.a pure waist of time and money
3,Hpoing For More,"I like the actress so I bought the movie. I was expecting more out of the movie, a little disappointed."
1,"Good Functionality, Poor Packaging","I purchased this product in order to share my cablemodem over two machines. It worked well and was easy to set up but it began to give me problems after a week. The case of the gateway is poorly grounded and is very sensitive to static electricity discharges. After a few accidental shocks, the unit began to fail. I would recommend that if you live in the desert and your house is prone to generating static in the summer, purchase the Netgear product. The Netgear Gateway has the same functionality, but has a better case design."
1,Unable to install product on cable modem setup,"Was anable to install this by manufacturer's instructions. Instructions are, in places, unclear, ambiguous, misleading, or incomplete.No technical support response from D-Link."
4,Great product great price,"I knew very little about networking when I started installing this router. I was the cause of most of my problems. I now know much more about networking. Two windows XP computers share a cable access, a printer, files and after installing firmware 257 build 3 messenger runs in the DMZ without problems.I never spoke with anyone from d-link but they did respond to two emails within 24 hours each time. The router runs 8-12 hours each day without any problems. I would recommend this product."
4,I'm Upgrading My Previous Rating of this Product,"The product works great once you get it working. Unfortunately, the included documentation didn't provide enough information to get it working with my system.I remedied this by first registering the product electronically on the D-Link Web site. (Lack of registration was apparently the reason for my email tech support requests having been ignored.) Once the product was registered, I received technical support by telephone. The entire staff was very courteous and helpful. The LAN was up and working within minutes of speaking with a technical support representative."
1,"Very poor, especially since Linksys is so good","I purchased this router because it was on sale, and I was forced to return it after it failed to function consistently. It took me nearly two hours to configure. After returning it, I got a Linksys and it was 5000% easier to install and didn't have any of the problems this had. Yes, D-Link has good customer service, but they hire so many employees for that department only because they know their products are bound to fail and the customers will send frequent complaints."
2,ok,"My DSL line has little problem to me so far. However, after I install this product, I connect my PC and laptop with it. I start my bad days. my pc and laptop freeze frequency. At the very beginning, I don't know know what happen. After trouble shooting on computers, I find nothing wrong but when I work on internet, email or doing the files transfer to my office. Later, I disconnect my DSL router and everything work fine now. I rate this product to 2 stars because it is easy to install."
4,Simple installation,It took me only 5 min. to make my Win ME and 98 computer work. All I did was release and renew my IP address.
3,Not if you want to host servers,"I was looking for a small office appliance when I purchased this item. We host two web servers. I was misled by the statement that the device supports NAT. It does, but not in a typical way. You can map an inbound TCP port to an IP Address on the internal network. You cannot, therefore, host more than one IP address that exposes port 80. THerefore, you cannot host more than one web site. Also, you get no real control over the NAT, and no way to turn it off. We returned the product and and looking at the DLink DFL 300 instead. On the other hand, this device would probably work really well on my Cable modem at home."
3,"Horrible Documentation, Good Product","If you aren't into having your network equipment look good (this product runs circa 1983 in design), the network hub works well and provides all the functionality you need for an at home network with shared broadband access. However, the documentation pretty much stinks if you hit any glitch. Also, all of the screenshots were for Win 98, not 2000 which is very different. I am not a ""network guy"" but reasonably tech savvy and couldn't make the network work on my own (I have @home which is problematic for this product). Essentially, the tech guy at D-Link told me I had to uninstall all of the @home software to make this work and that finally did it. I might try Linksys if I had to do it over."
5,Excellent for Mac w/ cable modem!,"Just got it today. Came with two cables. Hooked up the cable modem with existing wire, then hooked up my printer, G3 and Airport Station (for new G4) to the router with two cables that were supplied and one I purchased ($...). Followed two simple steps from their website, and now I have cable access on both machines, and perfect ethernet communication with the printer. Worth every penny. Easy to set up, Inexpensive, and Works great!"
4,Great Product,"Absolutley great product. Dead easy to set up and configure. I just plugged all my machines and cable modem into the router, copied the MAC address of the PC that was previously my router via Microsoft Internet Connection Sharing and I was up and running. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that the documentation is not great and the ports in the front do make it cumbersome to connect all the necessary wires for a local network. Other than those two minor issues I would highly recommend this product. A great value after the mail in rebate!"
4,"Good tight product, few tricky bits easily surmounted","This is an easily configured router, gateway and firewall. It took 10 minutes to get up and running. I now have a web, ftp and email server available to the public on one PC, and everything else locked down. The firewall works a treat, the DHCP and DNS work well, no problems.As a relative novice to networking at home (but experienced with most other IT matters) I found it a breeze. The only difficulty I had was getting it to work with the ADSL modem, which took about 2 hours of cursing, but eventually came good. That wasn't entirely the DI-704P's problem though.The only thing that I couldn't get to work, was being able to hit my DSL-300 modem through the router. This means I have to plug the modem in directly to the computer to configure it which is a minor inconvenience."
2,Arrived Damaged,Arrived damaged. Scratched up with assembly tool marks & having a bent main sprocket. It was unusable. I was promised a replacement part that was never mailed. Seller provides no telephone # for customer contact. Manufacturer was rude and unwilling to talk to me about the problem. All I got was E - Mail lip service. I had to spend more money at a bike shop just to get it on the road.
3,Very cute but....,"This table set is very cute but it is bulkier than I thought it was going to be. I have a 2 year old & a 4 year old and the 2 year old has a lot of trouble with the bench- I need to push her in and then I need to pull her out. I wish I had gone with more of a chair and table set instead of opting for the cuteness! Also, we move it around a lot and with all the pushing and pulling the table top has lifted twice already. Its an easy fix but also not what I expected. And finally, the finish on table top is not forgiving. After the first day it was stained with pen ink and stamper paint. I am afraid to really scrub so I have just left it. Its a kids table for snacks and crafts so no big deal but I did expect it to wipe up a bit cleaner. It looks great but now after owning it for awhile, I wish i had gone more for function over fashion."
4,Kids table and benches,This table was very cute with it's pastel colors. It seems to be holding up very well and is the perfect size for toddlers and preschoolers. It was a little more difficult to assemble than we thought it would be. IT took some time to put it together.
5,Love this table!,"Ordered this table for my 3 yo (and her little sister to use with her when she is older). She loves it and goes straight to it for projects and activities. Love the storage bin in the middle and I change it's contents periodically.I added removable place mats so it is easier to clean when she colors or uses play-doh. It is durable and great for what we were looking for.Yes-it took a while to put together, but that should be expected."
4,Line splitter for less!,I needed a multi tap splitter for testing but did not want to spend $15 at RS. Amazon came to the rescue again and provided me with an inexpensive substitute. The five outlet splitter is great when you have multiple components to plug in or if you want to use as a modular dispersal point at the demark for your house phones.
5,Works as expected.,"It's no frills, which is all I wanted. The cord is long enough to conveniently place it and it has enough jacks to support all my requirements."
4,about the essential - Kenny G,"I bought a copy of the essential- Kenny G from Singapore HMV and is found to be the taiwanese version (so called hongkong's version). It replaces three songs from the US version that is G-Bop, Januari, Jasmine flower etc. This is a nice collection and is recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of music. I bought this version as it includes the better/nicer music title that include morning, going home, the moment, jasmine flower, songbird, theme from dying young, sihouette and forever in love. The music midnight motion is also another not bad music as it shows Kenny G talent in playing with crerenade or etc. That's all.The Essential Kenny GReview by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahDirector 'lou Ye'- Ang Poon Kah for film summer palace."
3,Following up on interest,"My wife and I watched a feature about Kenny G on television. We both enjoyed the excerpts of his music, and thought that we would enjoy more of it. This we found to be true, however we like only so much of it. We like the CD in small doses, but we don't feel it has become a classic that we choose to listen to frequently."
5,Wonderful IntroTo MEHDl,"I've always enjoyed Kenny G and this album is no exception, but while reading some of the customer recommendations posted on this site I discovered a group by the name of MEHDl (pronounced medie). After an online search I found their site (S00THINGMUSIC,C0M) and listened to the samples...I was instantly blown away by the quality of this music and so I gave it a try and now that I have listened to these CDs several times I really must say that although I'm still a Kenny G fan, I find MEHDl to be a great addition to this CD. I have them both in my multi-disc CD player and love the way they compliment each other. I highly recommend that you give this artist a try or atleast just go listen to the samples, I have a feeling you'll be glad you did."
5,An outstanding book by UC Berkeley Professor William Muir,"William Muir served as a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan when he was governor of California, and also served as a speechwriter under Vice President Bush. However, he is better known as one of the top political science professors at UC Berkeley. Muir's book is an analysis of the speech-writing team that served Ronald Reagan. Familiar names like Peggy Noonan are featured prominently. The book shows how Ronald Reagan, as a President and leader, inspired his speechwriters to compose some of the greatest political oratory since Winston Churchill. Muir is certainly a sympathetic chronicler of Ronald Reagan and his administration, but every reader interested in presidents and the leadership of this particular President will want to read this book. Professor Muir is also the author of LEGISLATURE: California's School of Politics (1975), perhaps one of the most insightful studies of what makes a well-functioning state legislature."
2,fooey,"I ordered this recording by mistake: the Gardiner ""Zauberflote,"" which I wanted (and eventually got), was pictured so that was what I thought I was getting. I returned this one unopened. Having heard sound clips on the Net, especially the dreadful soprano Edita Gruberova, I had no intention of even giving it a try."
3,"Heavy Duty, but low light.","In this day and age of bright LED lights, you would think that this lamp would incorporate them. But maybe they weren't available at the time of manufacture. Otherwise, this lamp is very well built and seems to be very strong. I typically replace lamps like this every two years because they break down, but I can see this one lasting much longer than that. My only issue is the lights themselves. They are not strong enough for anything other than closeup work. If that's what you're doing, then this light may be fine for you, but otherwise it's too dim for say... typical office work. The color of the LEDs are also distracting with their bluish color. For my purpose, I wouldn't purchase this lamp again, but it may be fine for you."
2,Quality problem,"Length:: 0:24 MinsI bought it for desk work with small parts, but when I turned lamp on it started blinking like a car's turning light. I plugged and unplugged it couple times - same. After contacting seller they told me to open lamp and find loose contact inside or they wouldn't return $9.70 S/H charge. I done that, no loose wires, just some electronic fault (they don't have quality control I was told.) I took video to show them and was promised to get prepaid return label, to send lamp back. Never got it, so I had to pay for return.Amazon was on my side, after 5 weeks got my money back except for return shipping.Amazon is great place to buy stuff!Lamp construction of good quality, but without light is useless."
2,"my whole desk became ""electric""",I had this up for about 3 weeks. One day I touched my desk and got an electric shock. After several more shocks and trying to figure out what was causing them - it was determined that the lamp which I had clamped to my desk was shorting out and that's what was causing the shocks. When I tried to return it - I was told basically that I could not. Therefore I threw it in the dumpster - and am out the money spent on it. Don't make my mistake - this is one of those items which you really should spend the money intended for such a product. Cheap pricing in products like this can only mean trouble. I would recommend spending at least $90+ on a lamp like this. The one I had before was around $100 and it worked great for years until I dropped it and shattered the lens...oops
2,Correction,"I receive this light as a gift. It simply isn't bright enough. The accompanying leaflet said it's LED's have a total of 6 watts and the light output is 600 lumens. This is a false claim. The average light output of LED is about 40 lumens per watt. Therefore, the output is more likely to be less than 300 lumens; about the light from a 20 watts CFL. Don't buy this lamp, unless you have very youthful eyes.Correction: The brightness of 300 lumens should be about the brightness of a 20 watts tungsten lightbulb, not CFL."
5,I've needed this for years,All to often I received contracts with extremely small print. I mounted this magnification light on my desk and solved my reading problems for ever. This light is not just for a workshop.
2,"Purchased original on Jan. 2011, dead a year later","Bought this back on Jan. 11, 2011. It started flickering a couple days ago so I went to Lowes to get a replacement bulb. The replacement did the same thing. So I look closely and I see where the (flimsy) circuit area had blackened. If the new LED is built the same way as the fluorescent was then it is a piece of chinese crap. I really hate paying for junk. I want a well built lamp that will stand up to years of use. I am willing to pay double for that.If you go through the reviews you will see where 1 customer had problems with the LED not working properly. Poor craftsmanship and poor quality parts. I hate china.I will never buy from PJ Tool again."
5,Purchased as a gift,My wife got this for me. She wanted to buy something expensive but we couldn't afford it. When I opened the box and saw this I couldn't believe my eyes. It looks way more expensive than what it really is.
5,New Star in the Making,"Deborah Christian's debut novel heralds a new star to the field of Science Fiction and Fantasy. With her complex characters and believable plot, she is a welcome addition to my bookshelf.I look forward to her next effort."
3,Disappointing,"I didn't care for this recording. While it has some definite virtues (Roberta Alexander's passionate performance, Bonney's clarity), I find Hampson's performance to be lacking a certain commitment he brings to his other performances and recordings. The tenor is fine, but bland. Gruberova makes an interesting Anna. I thought the Leporello was horrendous - lacking any true vocal finesse and sporting a nasal, flat tone. Buy it if you are a fan of one of the singers, but don't make this your only Giovanni recording."
2,"Disappointing, in spite of the great names on cover.","Harnoncourt did a wonderful job with the orchestra (especially the accompanied recitatives), but forgot to tell his singers that they should sing rhythmically: The voices are wonderful, but never really together with the orchestra. It's very free and unaccurate. Generally the singing is very ""fine"", but has not so much to do with Mozart's style. There are better recordings."
2,not one for the list,"This recording was made shortly after Mr. Hampson sang his first performances of the title role at the Metroplitan Opera. A critic in the NY Times had the gaul to compare Hampson to the great Met Giovannis, Siepi and Pinza. As John Wayne might say, ""Not Hardly"". Hampson's affected and monochromatic singing characterize this entire recording. From top to bottom the cast is colorless and soporific, save for Barbara Bonney's charming Zerlina. There are substantially superior recordings available and for a lot less money. Try the classic London label recording with Siepi, Corena, and della Casa with Krips conducting. There is real Mozart singing and playing. If you must have Hampson, get one of his song recital cds, in which he uses the microphone to full effect."
3,"Its ok, not great","It's alot smaller than I expected, the buttons are so small you end up dialing the wrong number all the time. I never even used the handsets charger, and the other one doesn't have a locator button. We ended up losing our phone for like a week. I can't think of anything else, but its an ok phone, not great."
5,Great phone!,"This purchase was a pleasant suprise. Things I found unique were the ability to copy phonebooks from one phone to another, ability to name handset so I could intercom directly to another handset by name (I've got one in each of the kids bedrooms upstairs and no longer have to yell) and distinctive ring based on incoming caller ID.Great buy. I even bought extra handsets so we have a total of 4 now. The answering machine is simply and can be retrieved from any handset as well as remotely."
2,Started great; ended a dud,Liked the phone look and feel. Very easy to use and intuitive to program. The range was never much better than a 900 Mhz spread sprectrum phone that I had previously. The key labels on the handsets have started disappearing with in 4 months of use. They could have used better paint for the labels to remain. The handset has started having an echo already and is nearly unusable. Overall the quality seems to be lacking.

3,Beautiful but a bit inacessable.,"My wife and I are planing to walk the Camino in a few years and are devouring all the information we can find on the subject. I would rate this movie as being more in the way of inspirational than informative, though to be fair, it is clear that that was the director's intention.It is a beautiful movie, but the director is overly fond of split screen shots and odd camera angles. I found this a bit distracting. The subject matter is pretty enough that the presentation did not require gimmicks.Significant portions of the movie are not in English and no translation is provided. This is a shame because I was genuinely interested in what was being said.If you are reading this then you must have some interest in the Camino de Santiago. That being the case you will find this worth your time and money. It left me wanting to know more about these people. It is an interesting movie that could easily have been better."
3,Fine photography/filmmaking and poor overall substance.,"I liked the photography; however I felt there was excessive use of split screens and very low angles. I do not think the film provides a clear understanding of what the Camino de Santiago is about, or give a sense of the long journey that it is. With some exception, people interviewed add little to the overall picture. this film does not grab your attention for watching it twice. As soon you watch it the first time you forget who spoke and what they said. I would not recommend this film to anyone that whish to know more about the Camino. I grant though the filmmaking per se is fine and at times excellent."
3,Nothing really new for me,I was hoping to like this a bit more. I'm planning on the walk for next Spring and was looking for something a little more comprehensive.
5,Works great,"Came on time, all parts in box, pretty easy to put together. Son loves it, and it was a better price than anywhere else I found. Only complaint: they should add a ""funnel"" of sorts to help when you have to pour concrete down the assembled post. Our homemade cardboard one was a joke. I would have gladly paid $5 more for the product if they included a proven funnel that cost them$.50. Either way, would certainly buy it again if I needed to."
3,You need 3 STRONG people to put the pole in the ground,"We have been enjoying this for well over a few months now, but the putting the pole filled with concrete in the ground is reminiscent of a Caber in the Scottish sport ""tossing the Caber""This is a very Dangerous thing for one or even two people to do themselves."
1,Backboard broken after 3 years,"The back board was broken after 3 years in normal use. We do not use it a lot. I'm looking for replacement to fix it. What's my other choice, dig it out and throw it away?"
1,Charleston Receipts,"I was diapppointed that it would be impossible to recreate the recipes today as they gave directions to ""milk the cow"", but never how much! They also had to you add ""handfuls'. Well now, doesn't it depend on the size of the person's hand so it was impossible to get accurate measurement of the ingredients. If you wanted to read this recipe book for sheer amusement as to how they cooked way back when..well then...worth looking at! Amusing...a few gave you the idea. One did not need an entire book!"
4,Charleston Receipts...a timeless classic,"Anytime you can find a cookbook that has been reprinted as many times as this one, you know that you have found something special. As diverse as the city itself, CHARLESTON RECEIPTS has a unique blend of regional recipes, kitchen hints and ideas, and practical shortcuts. The offerings range from the everyday (Turkey Tetrazzini) to the sublime (Hampton Polonaise...a luscious cake from 1865).This cookbook has been handed down from one good cook to another since 1950, and with good reason. It is well suited for the modern cook as well as the kitchen veteran."
4,Great for Research,"I'm not much of a cook, but I write historical fiction. I bought Charleston Receipts because it has recipes from the region going back centuries. A few recipes are time consuming and antiquated for today, such as those for opossum, turtle, and squirrel. But most look doable and delicious, as well as unique enough to make your contribution to a potluck notable. I intend to try some of these!"
5,Incredible,Hard to find since it is out of print. But well worth the $ if you can find it. All tracks are great.
4,My four year old loves this one,"He doesn't care if it looks like Harrison Ford. He just likes taking the costume off and on. It snaps off and on easily, and is very durable. His twin brother fights him for it. They love all things Star Wars. A removeable costume for a figure is very entertaining to them."
1,"No hit, No Field","Baseball scouts in rating a prospect often use the term, ""Good Hit, No field,"" or vice versa, when describing a one dimensional player. This project falls under the category of ""No hit, no field"". When critics say, ""I like some country music, but not that nasal whiny hillbilly stuff,"" this is exactly what they're talking about. ""Songs About Rain"" is a nonsensical idiotic diatribe, the rest of the ""music"" nose dives from there. I have to wonder if he even opened his mouth while singing ""Tough Litte Boys"" (a maudlin touchy-feely effort about todays politically correct sensitive guy type). It sounds like it was sung completely through the nose. If this is the direction country music is going, I'm definitely looking elsewhere for my music. Jim Reeves must be turning over in his grave. In the meantime, I think I'll listen to some real music by Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli so I can get this toneless, talentless sorry excuse for music out of my ringing ears."
5,Gary Allan - A True Showman!,"Opening strong with pure honky-tonk and then ending on a soft note with the ballad `A Showman's Life', Gary Allan has delivered his strongest album to date with `See if I Care'. With a few great singles dealing with everything from broken relationships, which is tackled nicely in `Songs About Rain', to dealing with watching your little girl grow up on `Tough Little Boys' which is sure to bring even the toughest man to his knees. Songs like `I Can Love You' and the radio favorite `Nothing On But The Radio' show that this guy isn't all about failed relationships, he knows how to make the right ones work, and songs like the opener `Drinkin' Dark Whiskey' and `Can't Do It Today' show that country is in this mans soul. Any fan of Gary's previous efforts will gulp this one up with no regrets for every track is designed to please right to the core!"
3,Hit and Miss,"I have seen Gary Allen live and like his music, it is hit and miss. Some songs are really good and others not so good. This one is middle of the road overall with some good songs and some not so good songs."
5,The Best!,"The Nashville Scene posted results for 2003's Country Music Critics Poll and Gary Allan was voted 3rd best male vocalist behind Alan Jackson and Johnny Cash. After listening to See If I Care (hundreds of times!), I'd put Gary Allan's voice even higher. Such range from any singer is rare, and there's no monotone in this album, no whine, no monotony. Each song could be a hit and I just never tire of listening to it. Slow songs like I Could Love You and See If I Care, ""sing-along"" songs like Drinkin Dark Whiskey and Nothing On But the Radio as well as the first radio songs Tough Little Boys and Songs About Rain offer such variety that I can't compliment this album enough."
3,GREAT CD ONE OF HIS BEST,THIS CD IS ONE OF GARY ALLANS BETTER CDS. IM NOT A HUGE GARY ALLAN FAN BUT I LIKE THIS CD.
5,SEE IF I CARE BY GARY ALLAN,"AWESOME!!! ALL SONGS ARE GREAT, ESPECIALLY THE THE ONE WITH WILLIE NELSON 'A SHOWMEN'S LIFE' AND'SONGS ABOUT RAIN'HE GETS BACK TO REAL COUNTRY MUSIC. TRY IT AND ENJOY!!!!"
5,Wonderful!,"I just got this album today, and it's become my favorite album-next to Smoke Rings in the Dark, It Would Be You, and...all by Gary Allan. I have never been able to listen to one person singing a whole album until Gary's. Or listened to a whole album without skipping songs.Each song on See If I Care has a different sound to it, a different mood, and yet highlights Gary's wonderful voice. Each song sounds as if he means what he's singing. I am still trying to decide which one I like the best, so I guess I'll just keep playing See If I Care."
1,Buy the real Mob Hits album - not these fake recordings,"I bought this album thinking that it was cool since it included a DVD - boy was I mistaken - look at the name of the artists on the packaging...there are no names since it's re-recorded tracks by some posers called the ""Countdown Singers""...buy the real Mob Hits albums that have the bullet holes in the gold album on the cover..."
2,Problem starting,"***WARNING*** this product will not run on windows newer than 98. You have to download a dos emulator to run it. I still haven't worked out all the bugs, but it may be worth it. This is absolutely not a game for those who just want to play the game without issues."
1,Get something else.,"This product is no longer manufactured by 3M and some of them out there at retailers are defective. I got a drawer with all the parts excetpt for the little hooks to hang it on the brackets; which I had already drilled holes for and screwed in. I called Tigar Direct, the seller, and they wanted a ""defective code"" and for the drawer to be mailed by 30 days since shipped (not delivered). 3M said they don't have anything called a ""defective code."" So after about 3 hours on the phone total, over 2 days, I finally got to the ""product lead"" who said she would send me a return package sticker and then after they recieved the defective package they would send me another drawer.After about 3 weeks since I recieved the original defective drawer I finally got a good one. Meanwhile I had the key board on my lap.The drawer itself is fine, but the hassle getting wasn't worth it."
5,Great Movie,Really funny movie and I found myself glued to it all the way through. Most movies I lose intereste half way through.
1,Didn't care for it,I love Toby Maguire as an actor but this movie was down right pitiful. I like to consider myself an intelligent person but this movie just down right confused me. I wish I could get my rental money for this movie bac.
2,The Details,"It was so slow,and as much as I like the actors in this movie,I did not like it. Had to forcemyself to watch it till the end."
1,Stupid stupid movie ...don't bother,This movie was terrible. Ray L was Barely in it Sooo politically correct and completelyunbelievable. Not to mention drug use. Porn. Murder. Don't waste your time.
1,"This is funny? No way, it is sick!","OK, maybe obsessing about raccoon tearing up your lawn might be funny. But, beating off in front of porn on the computer? Murdering a pregnant woman with a bow and arrow? Having sex with your best friend's wife? And then moving on? Whoever wrote and directed this has a very weird idea of funny?"
3,"Dark, dark, dark comedy","Tempted to rate this higher because of all the hate it's getting on here. It is a very dark comedy, really bordering on not being a comedy because it's so twisted and tragic. Basically the story of a man who keeps making the wrong decisions, digging himself into a deeper and deeper hole with his ethical misfires. Makes you wonder how the story would have developed with different choices made along the way. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for Seabiscuit or Spider-Man Tobey Maguire. I've never cared for ""TMag"" anyway, but Laura Linney is wonderfully insane, and Elizabeth Banks and Dennis Haysbert are excellent in small supporting roles. Worth a viewing even if you wait til DVD release."
5,Interesting Plot,This movie shows how the tiny things can become HUGE things seeminly overnight. Great dark comedy!! I Would recommend it highly...
3,probably the oddest Harmony remote...,"I don't know if you can even buy this remote any more but I would avoid it and buy another model like the 659. This remote is very unusual as it feels ""upside down"" from the way you would want to hold it, and the roller on the side takes a bit of getting used to.Other than that it's a solid remote and capable of just about everything the other ones are. I used it for about 2 years before getting a new one."
2,"All ""I""","The author focuses entirely on herself, and she's not a pleasant person to spend an evening with--even at arm's length when reading the book. Her personality is a strange combination of whiny and self-important. If she had focused on the animals in her life, I might have considered this a less disappointing purchase. I'm in my forties, I like chick lit, I love animals, and I probably fit most of the other categories that should make me the ideal reader for the book, but it's just horrible. I felt very misled by the great reviews. If you love it, that's wonderful. This review is provided merely to alert other potential readers that it might not be what you think it is. My copy is destined for charity giveaway, where I hope someone will like it better for the price of a dollar or two."
2,Chopped and censored,"I swear this has to have been chopped all to pieces from the original movie. I wouldn't know because it was before my time, but the only boob you'll see in this movie are a few of the bad actors and your own reflection in your blank screen for having bought it. The story pretty much blew chunks of bile as well."
5,Miniature Chris Craft,"This is an excellent reproduction in miniature scale. However, I would only recommend this model for experienced modelers with a lot of time and patience. If interested, get as much resource material as you can b-4 you start."
5,Excellent telephone interconnect board,I am fully satisfied with this product. It matches my existing one and wiring wasn't very difficult. I could do it myself.
3,It's ok,"It was a little bit bulky and ornate for my style. The stones also seemed to be set rather precariously in the prongs, so I'm always worried about losing one. When I wear this, I feel like I'm wearing an out-of-date heirloom, only without the sweet backstory to go with it."
4,Love the Monkees,"Nicely packaged. Season two has some great episodes for Monkees zealots. If you can only buy one set, I would buy season one, since the Monkees sort of lost interest toward the end of season two, and a few of the episodes suffer. I have sons who are 5 and 8 years old who love the Monkees, and they really enjoy both seasons of DVD's. I think the Monkee's are clean wholesome fun and definitely a pop culture icon worth exposing your kids to. I wish they could remaster these episodes and upgrade the sound and possible the picture quality, but still great as is.Mike"
2,Typo's On Cover,"On the front cover, it says ""All 25 Original Episod s On A 5-Disc Set!"". Episodes is misspelled and there are 26 episodes, not 25! After playing a few episodes i see artifacts and compression issues. Either this is a very sloppily put together set or a cheap bootleg. Has anyone else experienced these problems?"
3,Not as bad as some say!,"First of all, I'm in the UK so am watching NTSC on a PAL format TV, which will have some effect on picture quality.While this is hardly the best quality DVD transfer ever done, I couldn't care less. For the money, it's great. It's all perfectly watchable, and some of the extras - especially the episode trivia - are excellent. Love the packaging as well, which is perfectly robust if you're careful with it.The bottom line is that these episodes are unavailable elsewhere on DVD as far as I know and I'm delighted to have them (although I prefer Season 1 overall). If someone produces some better versions, then fine, I'll buy them too!"
5,The Monkees: Season 2,"I got this for my wife as a gift back in 2009. She loved it so much she has almost worn the DVD's out, lol."
4,Good choice for the die-hard Monkees fan!,"This is the perfect gift for a die-hard Monkees fan! The video quality was fairly good considering the age of the originals. There were some special features on the DVDs, and we haven't finished watching all of the extra material. The boxed set is just like the photo shown - it comes in a box that resembles and opens like a record player. The DVD sleeves look like record covers.Overall, I thought it was a good set!"
3,Enough Already!,"Please remember that these are the Monkees. They were, at best, a pop fad. Nothing more! They can be compared to the boy bands of today. A group of guys thrown together based on the look and popularity of a particular generation. Yes, they did have a unique sound, and a very popular TV show, but they should in no way be considered icons, or have their work be scrutinized by theater and drama critics. I enjoyed the show and sound very much, but I was not even a teenager at the time! The Monkees are not Led Zeppelin or Nirvana. They are a ""cult classic"", like Rocky Horror...no more, no less. Just enjoy the music and stop picking them and this release apart. They were young men having fun. Sex, drugs and rock n' roll was the motto at that time. That should say it all."
3,A Rhino Rush Job???,"I was pretty stoked to hear that Rhino was finally going to release the second season of the Monkees' TV show. Once I got my package and opened it up I was pretty disappointed.The 45 record sleeves that held the discs were very poorly glued together. One was completely open as it had not been glued properly at all!The quality of the prints are very poor-there's lots of dirt on them in every episode. I was surprised at what a poor ""remastering"" job they had done on the prints. Many of the tunes (especially ""Goin' Down"") sound very muffled, no matter whether you set the audio at 2.0 or 5.1!I like these episodes immensely but I can't help but express my disappointment at the poor quality of it all."
3,tibetan groove,"Tibetan GrooveI really like the music, however; I was waiting for more ""groove"". Another product misnamed!!"
3,LIFESAVERS SPEAROMINT,"Well, item arrived in good condition and in a reasonable amount of time but it is not as pictured. I was trying to buy what was pictured (the old Spear O Mint flavor.) I received the NEW AND IMPROVED Spear O mint flavor. It's definitely not improved. :("
3,Gulp,"The internet is great in that you can find many lost items here, but the fact is most prices are well above the store cost. Guess if I can't find it locally, I'll do without."
2,COOL!,"I love this cover it is the best I got one for my brother, sister, mom, dad and grandparents they loved it they all said they where going to get some for all their friends if they could get some because these things sell out quickly"
3,Hard to Find Item,"We were happy to find these available on Amazon. Case of Tuffys was delivered ahead of schedule. First one we tried performed well at cleaning pots and pans as we remembered, but didn't seem to hold up as well (it was not that ""tuff""). We're hoping that this Tuffy was somehow defective and that others will do better. Time will tell. We have a bunch to go through."
2,The Search is Over,"After at least a few years of fruitless searches in 4 states, the idea to search the Web for Tuffies occurred to me; what a thrill to see that box with 24 of them arrive on my doorstep. They're still the same old sturdy, perfectly sized hard working scrubber. They'll probably last the rest of my life if I can fight off the relatives who are each trying to wheedle a couple out of me. Nice for stocking stuffers for people who still enjoy keeping house. Thanks, Amazon."
5,try these in your pond filter,My husband recently revamped our koi pond and designed a new filtration system using these little gems. The tuffys are a very good filter medium and so easy to clean! =^.^= =^.^= =^.^=
2,Not As Shown,"I ordered a box of the ones shown on this very page, but what showed up were the blue versions, not the orange and yellow originals.The ones that arrived were much flimsier than the orange and yellow one they replaced. The nylon threads were thinner, and because they are dark blue the new ones show trapped food scraps more easily. One has already unraveled after 2 weeks of use (the original lasted for several years).Tuffy scrubbers are great products, but I wouldn't buy them from this vendor."
5,Scrubbers don't get any better than this,"I used to buy these in a grocery store, until one day they just disappeared. If you've never used these before, you have to know that there's a reason why people have searched online and are willing to buy a box of 24, after they'd given up trying to find them locally. These things are amazing, as all of the other 5 star reviews will testify. I bought 5 or 6 of them a few years ago, and I still have 2 left. I'm just snagging these here, in the event that they stop selling them. I'll probably give a few to friends and relatives."
4,Easy but slow...,"The drive went in very easy, install was easy and I burned CDs with in minutes. However, when trying to do an exact copy, the burner was rather slow (30-40min) [for both data and music CDs], so if you want speed, this is not the drive for you. But if you want ease of use - buy it!"
5,An EXCELLENT product!! This is a must buy...,"I have tested many CD burners, and the HP9140i is by far the best. 5 stars cant even describe how great it is. It's the fastest, has the best quality, definantly underpriced and is hands down the best CD burner on the market. I recommend any shopper to buy this because its a great find."
5,Can't Beat It For The Price!!!,For [the price] this is the top burner there is! I've had itabout 3 months and have burned about 50 cds. I've had only 1 bad cdand 1 think that was the cd and not the burner.It burns a cd in about6 minutes or less. It's very easy and self explanitory to use. Theonlu complaint that I have is on the included cd labelerprogram. There is virtually no documentation. It took me the longesttime to fumble around and figure it out. They don't include any cdcovers or liners and they don't tell you that to make the program workyou need them. But that doesn't take away from how good the machineactually is. Get it.
1,TYPICAL HP JUNK,Expect these units to last no longer than an HP PC does. Which is usually only 6 months if you are lucky. I had one (not purchased at Amazon) which quit after 2 weeks. I was sent a replacement which died after 5 months of light use. I then purchased a cheap Memorex CDRW for $49.99 at some off the wall site. It's is still running fine (slow though). I can think of nothing positive to say about this product.
2,"Works okay, but breaks easily and too expensive","These work okay until they break. The plastic piece that you attach the strings to breaks off easily. Also, there needs to be more room for the cord to retract. We've got tall windows and I'm rather short, so after cutting the strings as short as I could still reach them when blinds are closed, they bunched up inside the winder when I pulled the blinds up. We've had several break and honestly, they are just way too expensive for a piece of plastic with springs in it. You could probably modify an old tape measure for less money and have a better product for much less. Unfortunately, they are the only retractable winders I can find and that's a necessary feature."
1,Not Durable,These broke in less than a year and it's impossible to put them back on if they fall off. Do NOT recommend.
2,Doesn't work for all blind situations,"If you have more than two blind cords that are a decent length this thing will choke. They should have made the housing larger or at least sell larger units. Also we had one of these malfunction, had to take it apart but didn't go back together well. If you have a set of blinds on a window that has a somewhat small cord length and no more than two or three control cords it may be sufficient. Otherwise buy a cleat."
2,"Not durable, unable to 'bundle' length of cord","The winding mechanism has failed after a year or so of usage time at least 2x so far. The length of our cord is fairly long for our wooden blinds, around 5 feet, so the winder can't 'wind' the entire length of the cord. It does the job reasonably enough that I'm not replacing the ones we have in place right now. However, when they break I'm not getting blindwinders again to replace them."
2,Nice - but only before it breaks,"These are really nice while they work, but they break too easily and don't last long enough. I've had two break where they don't wind the cord back up properly. The 2nd breakage is what prompted me to write this review. It's too bad too, because I really liked these while they worked."
1,Garbage!!!!!!,"I am fairly critical of design but this thing is just terrible. First of all it's huge. Then ends of your cords look like big cubes hanging from your windows with large orange warning stickers. Second, they are not smooth and easy to use. The switch that is used to extend the cord is very small and annoying to operate. Finally, the cord never actually get permanently affixed to the device and if it ever comes loose without a safety pin put in place the device becomes permanently useless. (the pin you would most likely discard once you start using them). I would ask for my money back if I thought I could get it. If I could give it less than one star I would. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!!!!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!,"I have never reviewed a product before, but my experience with this product was so bad I felt compelled. Not only is this product large, heavy and ugly when attached to your blinds it almost DESTROYED my custom made blinds. I followed the installation directions to a T. My blinds can go all the way down, and then open from the top. You need to remove any manufactured installed hardware on the strings of your blinds for the winder to work. So if your knot slips, poof, your binds don't work at all. This is the second product I have purchased to try to wind my blinds and I thought since it was a more expensive product, It would work better. NOT SO. Save yourself the hassle of having to take down, fix your blinds, put them back up and return the product. I couldn't be more disappointed."
1,Break too easily,"Great concept, but too fragile. I've had multiple of these break after just four or five retractions. I'm going to stick to a simpler solution going forward."
2,You have to cut your cord,You have to actually cut your cord to put it on. We haven't tried it yet as I don't want to cut my blind cords.
1,"Seriously dangerous, not approved for safety!","Length:: 4:51 MinsWe tested this device for safety and it failed miserably! This could be an option for babies up to 12 months, but once they begin climbing, they can find a way to reach the device. I am including a video so that you can see how dangerous this can potentially be in a home.Please see our website for more information on Window Covering Safety.www.pfwbs.org"
5,This time I mean it... Are you happy now?,"Never released in the US, ""Happy Now?"" was issued as a single CD in Australia, but a video was never made. Too bad, because it would have made a nice worldwide hit. It went to some radio stations in late '96 before the release of ""Don't Speak."" This single contains the album track, a song from the debut album called ""Let's Get Back"" (which is one of the best from that CD), and a live version of the Sublime cover, ""DJs."" No Doubt did a nice job on the cover, though I'm biased because I'm No Doubt obsessive! A nice rarity to add to your collection."
4,Best recent church history book on Ethiopia,"Hege's book is the best recent book available on the growth of an Ethiopian Christian denomination. It starts out with a strong focus on the early work of expatriate Mennonite missionaries, but in its coverage of later years, it shifts completely to a discussion of the Meserete Kristos Church and its Ethiopian members.Hege's work is based on 1st hand knowledge, archives, and pesonal interviews, including many Ethiopians. This is a book written in a library from all 2nd hand sources.Just as Gustav Aren's volume on the origins of the Mekane Yesus church is a widely cited work for the late 19th and early 20th century, Hege's book will be a primary source on certain aspects of Ethiopian church history in the second half of the 20th century.Those who dislike Christian missionaries will dislike the book, but not because it is poorly written.My problem is that it is such a good book that nobody will return my copy to me."
5,a welcome study,"Not only did Luz wrote a commentary of the highest standard, he also wrote some verry helpfull tools on the gospel of Matthew. This 'Studies' is one of them. Luz leads you through Matthew the way only he can. Some verry important subjects: The Fulfillment of the Law in Matthew, and: The significance of the Church Fathers for Biblical Interpretation. Once you get the taste of this, you will get the commentary also!"
2,"Poor quality materials, weak build.","I payed a few extra bucks to get the professional set, but there's nothing professional about it. The stoppers are made of cheap plastic and the seal is at best modestly tight. The cartridge holder is also made of cheap plastic and it doesn't close all the way. I don't find the wine to be atill fresh after 2 days, even if I keep it in the fridge. Do you want to drink your wine before it get spoiled? I suggest finishing the bottle in one sitting. Or try something else.... this product is definitely not worth 50 bucks."
2,Truly useless. Cheaply made.,"I wanted something more reliable than the vacuum stoppers for my best wines. This is not it. The stoppers are flimsy plastic, as is the preserver that holds the cartridges. The gas cartridges, once inserted, seemed to leak empty within days. They don't seem to form a tight seal. The worst part is the gas didn't preserve the wine as expected even for 1-2 days. There seemed to be an unpleasant odor compared to wines preserved with my vacuum stopper."
4,Pretty good product.,"The glasses are pretty amazing for the price. Just make sure your monitor supports a refresh rate of 100mhz. Anything below can give you eye strain and headaches. The wires get in the way sometimes. I don't know if other video cards work with this, but I used it with an Elsa Gladiac Geforce 2 GTS and it works great. This might not be an item you use all the time though, but it's a nice gadget to own. Overall this is a pretty good product, and it is... enough to buy."
4,Good Workout,I already knew I love Teigh and Gillian and their ideas and concepts. I love this workout because it is not too long yet I feel it each time I do the workout. The dancing is fun and different being sort of belly dancish. The resistance makes you feel it without turning your arms into jello for the day. Overall a great addition to my YBB library.
3,Not as useful as I'd expected,"The examples are not that innovative or inspiring, but it's ok if you want to get up to speed on value propositions."
5,Migraine suffers--enjoy this without pain!!,"This is awesome cheese. And for me and a few of my friends who suffer migraines and have trouble with blue cheese, are able to eat this. I first heard on Emeril Live that this cheese is different than other blue cheeses. And he is right, whenever I can find and afford it, I have been able to enjoy it without pain. I hope you enjoy it as well."
1,If you are looking for Seinfeld Don't Get This One !!,Hi allIf you are a Seinfeld fan don't get this one !! Jerry Seinfeld is there for only 40 sec !!! .
1,Dont waste your time or money,Someone recomened this book to me raving of its content and ease of use. That guy WAS WRONG!!! This book lacks many of the methods that you are looking for. It is pooly written and the online help for Visual Studio is better than this book (And its free)Save your money and just use the online help. This book isn't worth the paper it is printed on.
1,"Other uses, maybe?","The upside is at three cents a book, these can keep your fireplace burning for days; however, not as environment friendly as solar heat."
5,Love this station,"There is a place for everything in this drying station. I use wide mouth bottles and it's a little tight on space, but it works great for me. It's convenient on the counter when I have to grab a bottle for the baby."
2,Breaks easily,"We bought this item, because we could not find what we were looking for anywhere else. We had it about 3 weeks and the piece that holds the nipples/caps broke off and now everytime we go to set bottles on it, we have to attach it back on. Not very durable."
1,HATED THIS DRYING RACK!!,"I received this drying rack for my shower before I had my son. When we got it out of the box (right after the baby came home from the hospital) we noticed that it was broken and the piece that the paci's can hook on was broken. Needless to say, we needed to use it anyway, and to be honest, I really didn't miss it. (I put my paci's in my dishwasher anyway--but prefer to hand wash and sterlize my bottles). I used it for about 3 months and then the WHOLE thing fell apart while cleaning it. It cracked and wouldn't go back together. It did fit my Playtex Vent-Aire bottles and all of it's pieces pretty nicely, but I really think this rack is a piece of junk and very poorly made. I then went out and bought The First Years drying rack, and although it is smaller, it still does the trick and is sturdier."
3,updated 3/28/06,"I am a breastfeed only mother but I did use bottles for the first few weeks. The drying rack was fine and fit Advent bottles perfectly, but I did have an issue of leakage onto the counter top. The fix was easy, a dish towel under it. Overall easy to put together, held everything just fine, and helped me stay organized.update - we have finally weened our son and now he is full time bottle fed. We pulled out the drying organizer again only to find out that it does not hold our bottles! We use the Playtex Vent Air bottle (which we love) and it does not fit!!!! Soooo again we just stored the drying rack again. Very dissapointed that it is not universal, and it is really too small when you have a full time bottle drinker."
5,great buy,"great drying station for your baby's bottles and nipples and pacifiers and stuff like that, be sure to cover with a clean kitchen towel to prevent flies from touching them though, would definitely recommend to anyone!"
4,"Not quite what I expected, but almost perfect.","All in all, better deal and holds more than most of the others I looked at. (12!)It would have been perfect if it had included a tray to set it on, rather than just draining it into the sink.. as I wanted to keep it in the nursery. But thats my fault, I should have read the description better or asked questions. And besides it turned out ok, I improvised. =)I Love that there's a place for everything in this, and also that it fits the smaller mouth bottles, not just the prince lionheart wide mouth type. Even works for the angled bottles if you turn them the right way."
1,Defeats the purpose of having a drying rack,"I really don't recommend this drying rack to anyone. It does give you alot of space to put your bottles, but it leaks all over the counter. I need to put a dish towel under it to keep the water from running all over and onto the floor. Not very happy with this product."
2,Keep shopping,"Don't waste your money on this bottle rack. I echo the comments of a previous writer that this rack only holds limited number of bottles and gets water all over the counter. I've purchased three items manufactured by this company and they have all broken in short order, including this bottle rack. Stay away from their wipes warmer and their bathtub mat too."
4,Good computer for that not so on the road person.,"The Goods:DVD/CD playerExternal volume buttonsdefault DVD playerEasy access Internet buttonsProgramable buttons for personal shortcuts on keyboardThe Bads:Battery (4 hours if you just have it running on standby)Video card is part of the mother boardOverall this is a great laptop. My main use for this computer (gameplaying, DVD watching, CD player) is probably not the ideal use for a laptop. But I believe you should be able to customize your computer the way you want it."
5,Worked for me.,"Although I should have checked first to make sure the plug was an exact fit, I made it work. For the money I saved, it was no big deal to me. The one from 93-94 will work in later year applications with a little altering. Have to add one wire (12V hot) into the harness and one outside the harness for the memory wire (good thing I saved an old radio harness from another car, that made getting the wires I needed easier). Also had to shave off the edge on one side. Only took me 5 minutes to make it work. :)Thanks again."
2,but did you really learn anything?,"For my money, this book merely restates the obvious and begs the essential questions. Nobody serious about his golf needs to be told the stuff in this book. Those who are not serious will be ahead after being told nearly anything. There is a vast industry devoted to helping people improve their golf scores from 103 to 97. Typically, the inprovement results from reducing the number of scalded wedge shots and four putt greens. I would like to know how many reviewers after reading this book went out and hit the golf ball solidly and dead straight? I would guess that more went out and clogged up the course with an endless preshot routine."
1,DON'T BUY!,"I got the tuner card a week ago and I had sound problems right from the start.When you watch TV,you can hear a crackling noise about every 5 seconds,which is really annoying.I contacted ATI to solve the problem,but their support is VERY SLOW in responding and what they suggested didn't improve the sound at all.I have a brandnew ACER TravelMate4050,I don't have any sound problems at all,apart from the sound coming from the ATI card.I also upgraded to the latest drivers,nothing helped.I'm returning this."
5,Great alternative for tv in dorm,"With all of the useless junk that comes with college students, during move-in day, its nice to have one thing that takes up little space. This card is a great alternative for lugging a 13"" TV into your tiny apartment or dorm room. Plus, it has a great DVR function that records at high bitrates, but surprisingly little hard drive space. The TV Guide function is extremely useful, especially when recording shows missed from class or work (or life). Though some problems may occur with installation or other minor things, the [...] website and staff are very helpful in answering your questions. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to save space and has a USB 2.0-compatible laptop!!!"
5,"Easy to install, Picture comes out clean","Installed to Sony Vaio V505 laptop with no problems. Analog signal isn't as clear as the component inputs. Hooked up the analog cable signal coming from my vcr. My XBOX is hooked up to my vcr inputs so now i can play xbox or playstation2 on my PC Monitor. Excellent product. Easy to install; load software, connect the USB connection, restart, and just like that television programs on your PC Monitor. I highly recommend this to anyone that has a laptop."
3,Could be better,"This thing was easy to install, but it doesn't do everything it says. The touted scheduled recording function doesn't work. However, I discovered I could go through the tv listings manually and click ""record"" on the ones I wanted; then my shows recorded fine.For some unknown reason, this thing doesn't track all the television stations available to me, and it doesn't give me the chance to choose the stations I want to pick up (or remove), even though that's something the manual promises. I'd like to delete some of the shows I've recorded, but I still have no idea where to look on my hard drive to PERMANENTLY delete them.The manual is only minimally helpful. The website is even less helpful. Don't get this thing unless you're a never-say-die sort of person. You're pretty much on your own. I wouldn't buy this brand again."
1,Hoooooorible,"Doesn't work at all if you install directly from cd. The drivers are outdated and do not function with newer laptops.ATI just updated their drivers, but you can't install them if you don't uninstall EVERYTHING from ATI first. This includes your graphics card driver.... good luck finding it again!If you do download the updated drivers/software from their site, you will no longer have the tv listings.If you install the tv listings using the custom settings from the original cd, your whole system will crash and you'll need to refromat everything, or re-image with Ghost.If you're not careful when you install, the temporary tv on demand files will eat up ALL your hard drive space, and you'll have to 1) First find the damn thing, it is a hidden folder 2) Change your viewing options so you can see the files 3) Delete the files while the program is turned off, or again, your system will die.Think very very carefully before buying this product."
1,cannot get it too work on a Toshiba laptop,bought a new Toshiba M65 multimedia center laptop for christmas and the ATI TV Wonder USB 2.0. Could never get it too work. Would not initialize the device. No help from ATI. Downloaded all the new device drivers from ATI and Toshiba. Very frustrating.consider yourself warned.
2,Own a mac? Don't bother!,"Initially, this worked great! A few months later, the quality of any standard cable (usually channels 2-20) dropped to a barely visible resolution. Then, recordings would stop suddenly, and kill the whole system. Even preset recording schedules would start, then anything between 1 and 20 minutes into the recording, it would sieze, and nothing would even appear. No live tv either. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because I can still (sort of) watch tv."
4,4 star due to the software application,the singal of the cable is not losing any of its picture quality but the software is poor and unstable. Other than that it is a great product.
2,Avoid this Product,Have had a terrible time with this product. Some of the issues include:- installation software won't fully load on my XP Pro Dell Computer- Customer Support line just rings to a busy signal (no doubt they are overwhelmed with the number of problem callsI wouldn't recommend this product to others.
1,Installation and driver nightmare,"I tried installing the ATI TV WONDER software - exactly as described in the instructions. The TV Tuner failed to initialize. I then downloaded the latest drivers and it made no difference. Over many years of using ATI products, I have always found the drivers to be of poor quality. Stay away from ATI until they get their quality act together."
1,Software installation caused computer to freeze,"I purchased this ATI TV Wonder USB 2.0 tv on 6/13/05 simply to explore its capabilities. But the software refused to fully install on my 2 year-old Sony desktop with a 20"" Dell LCD.In two attempts, it frooze my Sony after partially installing. Worse, it somehow changed my system to be left only with the basic defalt video drivers. So.. I needed to dig out my Sony CD, etc. If you are not comfortable messing with your operating system, STAY AWAY from this product.The software did install on my Dell laptop without incident, but I then found that the laptop had the too-slow USB 1.1. Can't blame ATI for that.Because this ""toy"" was the opposite of ""essential"" for me, I was not willing to spend hours with customer support and sold it on eBay.I'm sure it can work fine on some computers. It just needs a sensitive accommodating home."
1,Jaw-dropping,"This book is quite possible the worst ever written on this subject. It's only redeeming quality is that it turned out no longer than it did. Riplinger's ""research"" is unmatched in its ability to produce misleading, out-of-context quotes.I gave the book a 1 star rating because Amazon doesn't have a zero star option."
1,An insight into madness,"I have never read such an abominable travesty as this work. I really believe that the author must be mad. There are many good arguments for TR/Majority Text/KJV/etc to be made, but few of them are made in this volume and those that are included are lost amidst a sea of paranoid babbling. Don't waste your time, money or the paper this book is printed on."
2,"Good intentions, but questionable research","Gail Riplinger no doubt is correct in her condemnation of the modern versions of the Bible. Unfortunately, the facts that Ms. Riplinger offers in NABV are so scattered amongst her personal opinion that it is hard for the reader to desipher between them. I would recommend the charts in this book to anyone I come in contact with, but I would not recommend the book. Satan is certainly at work with these new versions and the continuous attack on the KJV, but NABV does little to help in this discussion. I would recommend Dr. William Grady's ""Final Authority"" to anyone who truly wants to have a serious look at the version controversy that is sweeping our churches today. Riplinger had good intentions, but the book falls short of where it needs to be."
1,Contributes to the public image of ignorance in Christianity,"This is a poorly written, sparsely researched book. I would not personally recommend anyone waste their money on it. It is truly shameful that Christians have been duped by emotional, unsubstantiated works like this. The material presented leans far from scholarship and more to a superstitious belief - God never said we had to shut our minds down when we came to Christ! The Bible existed before 1611 and will exist after it, Jesus said His word wouds would never pass away. Hopefully we as the body of Christ will learn to become more discerning, instead of letting con artists like Riplinger ravage our ranks."
5,"A ""Must Read and Read Again"" Book","At first a skeptic. I did want to know which Bible God want us to use, so I read a lot of books both on the topic of textual criticism. Being Scandinavian I'm naturally suspicious of whatever those cross the Atlantic had to say, because after all it's from there ""most"" trash comes from. Did not want to be soaking up some cults opinion, so I compared and checked up the facts in lexicons, Greek interlinear (various) and many other reference material. Yes G.A. Riplinger has done a remarkable good job exposing this New Age Bible money spinning circus, which time and time again is lying even in the footnotes."
1,How one could possibly agree with this is amazing!,"Gail Riplinger, who claims God Himself is to be accredited as her co-author, wrote 700 pages based on imaginative thinking and backed by even more imaginative research. Has anyone really checked her sources? Her blatant misrepresentation of the truth is appauling! That a ""home decorater"" would claim to have knowledge of textual criticism is almost comical. She has no study in the Biblical languages and yet she claims to speak authoritatively on this exhaustive and complex subject. It pains me to know that some poor souls would read this book and accept it as fact or worse yet a blessing from God. John Broadus once said: ""It is amazing how much ignorance some men (or woman) can accumulate""."
1,Extremely poor scholarship,"Riplinger in this book repeatedly and consistently proceeds to draw bits of the modern Biblical text out of context to fit her personal ""pro-KJV"" agenda and exercises poor exegetical and biblical scholarship in her pursuit of a ""KJV only"" theology, even to the point of violating common sense."
4,Dave says....,It is a good book. Well written and thorough. He may get out into left field from time to time but overall I agree with what he says.
1,Good Liner for the Birdcage,Is this still in print? Mine went into the garbage can 10 years ago. What misleading drivel. It's the bunk.
1,By far one of the worst example of research ever presented.,"Ms. Riplinger's book is rife with errors,falsehoods, misrepresentations, misquotes andfaulty reasoning. It lacks so much in solid research that the credibility of the author is all but lost. Upon closer, independent research one finds that Ms. Riplinger either had shoddy research or else purposely mislead the reader to further her own agenda. I honestly and sincerely cannot and will not recommend this book as an truthful and accurate resource. You want truth? Skip Ms. Riplinger's book."
1,A horrible absolute book of slanderous lies!,"Yeah, those are strong words, but true. Riplinger name-calls and makes all manner of unsubstantiated, slanderous accusations against a wide-array of widely respected men and women. She gives referances to their books, but almost every time I double checked her she either misquoted them or, many times, just made up the quote altogether! She also claims God talks to her and that whenever the Bible says ""word of God"" it means the King James! This is absurd, and to give any attention to this book is a waste of time. I wish I could regain the time I spent reading this nonsense! Should have NO stars, but I wasn't allowed to do that. No, it should be in the MINUSES!"
1,Nobody's Mind will be Changed by This Book,"If you already believe that the King James Version of the Bible is a supernaturally superior translation of the Bible and that modern Bible translations are the work of the evil, horned, red-pajamed oogly-boogly one, this book will preach to the choir of your heart. On the other hand, if you believe that ""King James Only"" adherents are out to lunch, then this book will probably manage to astound you to the point of laughter with tabloid-style theological sensationalism and shallowness. (Ooh, and be sure to read her section on ""Acrostic Algebra""...it's a HOOT!) If you insist on reading this book, I'd strongly suggest reading ""The King James Only Controversy"" by James White (you'll see the reviews on his book are also 'love or hate') but his credentials are impeccable. And yes, he's conservative."
1,"Illogical, inaccurate, and riddled with error","Gail's arguments are so ill-constructed, her reasoning so unsound, and her scholarship so fallacious that one wonders if *any* statement she makes is accurate. I'm troubled by her story that God literally dictated the book to her. I encourage the serious Bible student to check all her references--they don't add up. I'm also troubled by the unnecessary division this book has motivated in the body of Christ. The reader is encouraged to examine James White's book: ""The King James Only Controversy"" (www.aomin.org). He presents a well-researched, scholarly, and praiseworthy defense of modern Bible translations"
1,Misleading.,If anyone really looks at what Riplinger wrote and checks all the references they would not believe that any sane person would take her seriously.
1,Has it come to this???,"I take no pleasure in writing bad reviews about other Christians however, the awful scholarship in this book needs to be pointed out. Many reviewers have already pointed out the wild conspiracy theories and the strange reliance on numerology, so I won't comment on that. However, the awful scholarship and name-calling contained in this book can only serve to further divide the body of Christ.In addition, I would like to point out that the fact that so many people are trying to discredit this book does not indicate that Satan hates this book. Afterall, many people are trying to discredit the work of: Joseph Smith, Karl Marx, and the Watchtower Society."
1,What a Joke,You have got to be kidding. Read James White's rebuttal of this book for the real story. Riplinger has done more damage in the body of Christ by confusing people and focusing on a non-issue than I have ever seen.
1,This is a stupendouly inept book!,"The only reason I put 1 star is because it would not allow me to do less! This book is a pseudo-intellectual farce that aims more for emotional tirade than accuracy. The author seems to think that somehow 1611 was when God finally inspired the Bible (never mind current KJVs are based on the 1769 revision). It is attitudes like that of the author that caused the deaths of men like Wyliff - and caused the Bible to be in the hands of the Magesterium of the Roman Catholic Church and not in the hands of God's church. If one examines the true facts behind the book the ineptness of the ""research"" will show itself. It is unfortunate that members of the body of Christ must have drivel like this associated with them."
1,Deception,"The Author uses spells and chants in her book. Compares certain translations with the KJV (as if the KJV were the original), rather than compairing all translations (including the KJV with the orignal). Let's see now, if you were going to write a book and it was going to be a Christian book, would you make the cover black with a red dragon on it????? Think about It!"
1,The epitome of academic dishonesty,"In summary, I had a hard time believing that anyone pretending to be a ""scholar,"" let alone a Christian scholar, would stoop to this level of intellectual and academic dishonesty. Riplinger misquotes her sources, takes quotations out of context, and even makes quotations up (in at least one instance that I detected). She takes the most tenuous of connections between modern Bible translators and occultists as ""proof"" that there is a conspiracy afoot to corrupt the Bible in preparation for the alleged One World Religion to come. Riplinger misses no opportunity to belittle any scholar connected with modern Bibles. Furthermore, the book is rife with spelling and stylistic errors, including frequent misspellings of sources' names (she DID have these sources right in front of her, right?)."
1,Poor Scholarship,"While this book has become very popular in many evangelical circles, Riplinger's methodology is quite dubious. Her conclusions about the corruption of modern bible versions are not warranted. For a clearer discussion of the issues surrounding the ""KJV Only"" debate, I recommend ""The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust the Modern Translations?"" by James R. White. For an earlier book on the subject, I recommend D.A. Carson's ""The King James Version Debate : A Plea for Realism."" White's work is more thorough, however.I give this work a ""1"" not because of Riplinger's writing, but because of the poor academic quality of her work. Her reasoning is demonstrably faulty in several ways."
1,Insane crud,"G.A. Riplinger, an interior designer with no qualifications in Biblical studies, says that all modern Bibles (including the NKJV, which is virtually identical to the KJV) are part of a New Age conspiracy to bring in the reign of the Anti-Christ.Her ""proof"" is as follows: if you take the letters of the various modern Bibles, like the NIV and NASV(sic) and add them together, you get 666.If that's the best KJV supporters can do, long live the NIV!(By the way, anyone who thinks the modern Bibles take out important doctrines like the deity of Christ should compare John 1:18 and Colossians 1:19 in a modern Bible and the KJV. The truth is that modern Bibles, and the earlier Greek text on which they are based, gives more honor to Christ than the defect Textus Receptus on which the KJV was based.)"
1,Money Maker,"Gail's 'facts' are what most would call 'fiction', in spite of her home economics' degree. However to make big money one should write with a semblance of learning to undermine the works of real scholars. She should be able to retire wealthy of pocket if not of mind. This book has little basis in fact, and time & again takes biblical themes (eg lordship) expanded often by human error, then lambastes such as the NIV simply because they have removed the human additions of the theme. If God started with the KJV she is correct, otherwise incorrect.I use her work in teaching college students about biblical text & translation. I include mischievous cut & paste from her words, making her sound like a diabolist, then making clear that it's not an accusation but to show how cut & paste can present inverse pictures of folk & their motivations. Her book is replete with such cut & paste attacks. Her inventiveness deserves a star, but let the reader be aware & beware."
2,Does the world speak only English ???,"One has to wonder at the basic premise most KJV only types operate from: the KJV is God's gift to whom ? The English-speaking nations only ? Does God speak English ?Come on - anyone can see the folly right there. If you are a native English speaker and love the KJV, fine. But don't tell me the NIV is new age. I love the NIV and it's my Bible, so there. And, I can read the NIV in Spanish as well."
1,Slanderous contempt for research integrity,"With all the hysterical concern about the differences between the new translations and the King James Bible, wouldn't it be fair and informative to find out WHY the newer versions have some differences with a 400-year old translation from Erasmus' work? Not only do many of the words in the KJ mean something entirely different in our language (lists are available), but many older manuscripts are available now than in 1611. Also, discovery of more ancient secular documents help to translate original words more precisely. A lot of devoted, careful teams of people of integrity have labored over these translations. It's nothing short of slanderous to accuse them of deliberately warping the Word of God. Shame on you!"
5,Awesome,"Please read this book from an objective point of view and you will see the Devil at work. We all should ask ourselves are we ready for the judgement day? We can all favor our religions oh, oh this book sucks beacuse I am a Mormon, No, No i don't like this book becuase I am Catholic and they forbid me to read it. Look folks let's keep it simple, it's not about losing an argument it's about losing your soul. Please apply some common sense and get away from organized religion and get into Christ. He will save you, He will save you NOW!"
1,The scary thing is. . .,". . .is that some people actually BELIEVE this stuff!!!You CAN'T give an honest critique of ANY translation of the Bible without engaging the original language manuscripts!Ms. Riplinger has little or no actual theological training -- indeed, her background is in the Fine Arts.Her polemics run from the entertaining to the flat-out embarassing, castigating any and all who would disgree -- or even try to interact -- with her.I'm certainly not knocking the King James Version. For it's time, it was about the best translation around -- and remains a remarkable example of classic English. But it is certainly not the best translation out there.Give it a rest, Gail! Enough already!"
5,AAAAAAAAAAMEn! Spray 'em Gail!,"NABV sprays the scribes (scholars), manuscriptolaters, ""christian"" educators, ""sword of the sissies"", etc. full of lead and makes them stompt their feet and throw tempter tantrums. If you believe the Bible God has provided you (KJB) then this book shows you valuable ammunition. But if you've made up your mind to make a liar out of God, neither this book nor anything else will help."
1,"This book is absurdly inaccurate, and unverifiable","This is research? Comparing particular verses within the King James Bible to verses within modern versions to prove how they aren't exactly the same, thereby proving the superiority of the King James version isn't proof...it is a poor excuse for a research method. But, when a Christian isn't very familiar with God's Word, it is much easier for them to sit back in their pew and listen to these silly methods of determining a Bible versions soundness. A balanced person would do their own research, instead of blindly listening to a representative of King James Onlyism use illogical principles to prove their point of view. Please don't be a party to this."
5,Information book,"Terror in Black and WhiteI read a tract that advertised a book which compared the new age Bibles to the King James Version. I was interested so I purchased the book. I was completely astonished at what I learned. I have been under the impression that the NFJV and the NASB were written to simplify the bible and make it more understandable by the general reader. G. A. Riplinger has shown that there are places where the actual meanings were changed. She gives actual verses that ilustrate her study.The book compares verses from each version and I was surprised how many places didn't simplify but only changed words like God and Jesus to ""He"" and actually eliminate many important verses. I recommend anyone who uses a bible other that the KJV to read ""New Age Bible Versions"" by G.A. Riplinger."
3,EXCELLENT BRAND BUT BUTCHER'S BROOM NEEDS TO STANDARDIZED FOR 'RUSCOGENIN' TO BE EFFECTIVE,GOOD STUFF BUT NOT AS POTENT AS STANDARDIZED PRODUCTIN A NUTSHELL: SAFE TONIC FOR NUMEROUS VASCULAR CONDITIONS - but -Butcher's Broom is touted as being great for a large number of vascular ailments as well as arthritis and swelling. The only trouble is the standardized product which contains 50-100 mg. 'ruscogenin' is essential if one is seeking a therapeutic effect [according Dr. James Duke].The standardized product is of particular importance if one seeks relief from hemorrhoids or varicose veins.[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]
2,"It does not work, period!","I've finished the whole bottle. I don't see any results at all.For me, it absolutely does NOT work.Nothing positive to say this product."
3,NO reponse! From Natures WAY,I read about Butchers Broom on WEbMD and was worried as there was report it constricts blood vessels! got me worried as I had DVT on leg and still have problems due to circulation. My Dr advised NOT taking it (I wanted it to improve circulation on leg) Wrote to Natures Way 3x telling them I needed MORE info on Butchers Broom - before I would 'risk' taking it. Got responses saying they'd get back inside 49 hours - NEVER DID =- despite my warning then I would contact Amazon. Yeah product arrived on time and as ordered - BUT please- if I want more info I need it. I presume - MAYBE they don't know what they are selling!
5,Astonishing!!!!,I saw Christine Martucci in 2005 when she opened up for Scandal. She has an amazing voice and is an all-around nice person. She definitely knows how to rock. She has a kind of Joplin/Etheridge sound but is also very bluesy. It's hard to describe her but she has amazing talent. She also has played at various music festivals as well.
5,Having some new old is good,This album really ministered to my being. I had it back when they use to make vinyl and cassettes. Glad it wont scratch and/or get caught in the tape player
1,Don't buy,"The only things funny about this book were the title and the picture on front. I read the whole thing thinking ""Surely this is funny somewhere"" but it truly is not. I gave it one star because you apparently can't give it none."
1,Less than zero,"How very cruel. I am sorry these authors are going to raise children that will no doubt be as sick as these two. Remember, girls (and you are emotional girls): what goes around comes around.If you love nasty, if you love hateful, if you love mean--this is the book for you. I cannot imagine any healing will ever take place in these lives.More sorrow and hate in the world - just what we need."
1,Immature,"This is a book lacking in compassion, with no attempt to understand the issues involved in a diffcult, but potentially correctible relationship. It's mean and vindictive, and not as funny as the authors think it is. Let's hear from them when they become mothers-in-law themselves. Interested families should read other, more helpful books that will alleviate, not exacerbate problems with cruelty."
2,Big Disappointment,"I hate to disagree with the previous reviewers, but I think this set is a huge disappointment. First, there is little attention to the musical phrase and, as a result, little tension is developed. It is done in a very matter of fact way. Compare to Atlanta's recordings; not even close. But it's not the orchestra in my opinion; its a lack of vision on the part of the conductor. I'd like to hear these conducted by Yuri Temirkanov, a superb musician."
5,are there larger sizes????,Are there larger sizes?? I would like a mens size 12 please. It is a christmas present so please hurry.
5,Smooooooth!!!!!,"This album is a joy! A true Maestro of the open back banjo. As with any great performer he makes the execution of the tunes appear effortlessly played. If you are a Fan of Old Time music and Clawhammer banjo then you will love this treasure, (calling it just an album would be a disservice). A rare gift from a musician with a truly musical soul. Thank you Adam for preserving and improving these old tunes. Lest we forget!"
2,"20,000 hour warranty? Try 20 hours","Within 20 hours of screwing this bulb in, it died. Yes, it's warrantied for 20,000 hours but seriously, who is going to go to the trouble of shipping a light bulb back?"
2,Was nice while it lasted,"Well this microwave looked nice, and heated food quickly. The settings for specific foods were way too complicated, so I never used them. Unfortunately, it stopped working within two months. It worked just fine, no signs of problems, up until one day, it just didn't heat anything anymore. I lost the receipt, so I couldn't get it repaired.I wouldn't recommend this microwave, generally, not just because of my problem with it, but because of the complicated controls. There are easier to use microwaves out there. Incidentally, the website I bought this from (not this one) said that it had a sensor. It doesn't."
3,ok for the price,one thing that bothers me about this microwave oven is the door latch. It seems to be a bit unstable and i am wondering how long it will last. Time will tell. I guess they do not make things like they uses to
1,Always loved Sharp but.........,"I have always been very pleased and trusted Sharp brands, would not have bought any other brand, but, I have had this microwave for about 3 months and one morning it made this roaring sound and it did not heat my coffee. I tried it again and it did the same thing. So, I unplugged it and I have to buy another one. Still looking for the receipt to take it back. C. Arkansas"
1,Bad product,"I usually love Sharp - which is why I purchased this microwave for my office. Very nice looking, nice features, nice buttons.The problem is that it broke within a year. It has been making a screeching and squealing sound when trying to heat food.Granted we do use it every day because it is in our office, but I hoped it would last at least a year!"
5,snot rod,"i did not know it would come out a little bigger than the usual 1:55 diecast we already had, but its a great toy!"
2,Beware of constant audible hum from charging circuit.,"I purchased one of these to replace my aged BR1000. I thought I would go up in capacity/runtime, and this unit is of identical form factor = no rearranging my desk. However the internals are different and this unit makes a very audible (not loud, but audible) hum from the charging circuit, whether on or off. I will be returning it and likely getting a battery for my BR1000, because the hum is going to drive me nuts."
3,APC BR1200 Back-UPS 1200VA,"I ordered the APC BR1200 Back-UPS 1200VA just to have a backup in storage for my current model. We own several APC backup power supplies and have found that they usually work fine. Our electrical supply goes offline at least once a month, sometimes for only a few seconds but occasionally longer. Our APC Back-UPS have protected our computers from these outages and the surge when power comes back on. However, this unit arrived DOA.I was completely satisfied with Amazon.com's service. I was able to ship it back and get a complete refund. I especially appreciate that Amazon.com arranged for the pickup from our house. I give Amazon.com five stars for their service but give APC two stars for letting this one slip past their quality control. Backup power supplies/surge protectors need to work ALL of the time. Finding this unit dead out of the box rattled my confidence."
2,Damaged,Wrote an email about the condition of this book...it came bent in the middle and w/wrinkles in it. I sent and email to Bethany's Heart Used Books but didn't hear a reply. I had ordered this as a Christmas present this was very disappointing since I did order a new copy. According to your guarntee I think a new replacemnent should be sent or refund. This was the first time I have ordered on Amazon and won't do again for gifts. How can I get a response????
5,One of the best games on the market!,"Sonic is finally on GameCube! This game's addictiveness level is very, very, very high. The fact that it's 4 different catagories makes it better. Here are the catagories. 1: Sonic/Shadow Action levels. Run through ring-filled levels, avoiding traps. 2: Tails/Eggman Shooter levels. Run through enemy-infested worlds, blowing up junk. 3: Knuckles/Rouge Treasure Hunt levels. Run through large worlds, finding keys or Master Emerald Shards. 4: Chao Virtual Pet World. Raise cute, little babies, feeding them, petting them, mating them (yuk!), and taking them to Kindergarten. The 2-Player mode adds even more fun to the game. The most fun levels I've played would have to be Iron Gate (Eggman), Dry Lagoon (Rouge), and Chao World (All)."
3,Rent it first...,"The camera in this game is VERY frustrating at times, control is very limited and sometimes walls get between you and your character making it impossible to see, this is a major problem when playing as knuckles while hunting for the emerald shards. Other then that the graphics are beautiful and sonic is faster then ever. It is a fun game, but the camera is so horrible I reccomend renting it first to see if you can put up with it. Also I wish there was an option to just turn off the backround music, its bad. Sounds like Crazy Taxi rejects or something."
5,A+++++++++++++++++++++++++,"Take it from me this game rules!!! Play in three storys dark,hero,and last. This game I give it a 5 beacuse it is wickeley awesome!!!! My sister even liked this game but she hates video games she even gives it a 5!! The bad thing about this game is the control I at least give it a 3.5. It's the best game for me and my sister we cant wait for number 2 coming out for the one and only gamecube!!! Go to gamespot to get more information join if you wan't. That is the number 1 game site."
3,"Great game, but came at less than decent quality","I bought this game for my girlfriend & I to play, since this was a major childhood game we used to enjoy. Even though I purchased the game in okay condition, it came in a bit more scratched that I would've liked. It still works about 50% of the time. But when it does, it's very fun and we spend countless hours on the multiplayer & raising out chaos. Very fun!"
4,Good game,"its an amazing game, going back and playing it a few years after and its just as amazing as i thought it was the first time"
5,Yea!!!!,"Finally, Sonic on a Nintendo system! I've played Sonic Adventure 2 for Dreamcast and it was awesome! The 2 Player ""Battle"" modes that have been added to the game for GameCube are cool, but the best part of the game is still the main adventure, ""Story Mode"". With the power of the GameCube, Sonic's greatest adventure yet is bound to have better graphics than that of the original Dreamcast version, but even if the graphics don't improve, the game will still be the second best game out there for GCN, at least until Metroid Prime hits store shelves. Now if we could only get Jet Set Radio Future for our superior Nintndo consoles..."
5,Chao's,"The game is short if you don't count collecting all the emblems but what brings this game together is yes Chaos. Chaos are creatures like pets exept they can evolve into hero neutral or dark. They gan go to school, fight in karate, and race.You can fight and race your friend's chao with two different memory cards and controllers. This is a good game if you have a lot of time."
5,ERIC MY SON LOVE IT,"This was my son's first gamecube game, and we loved it right away. Great graphics, full of action, and educational!!"
2,Owch.,"Sonic just isn't the same in 3D, and this game proves it. When you control sonic the game is fun, but you are not given the option to be sonic the whole game and you end up going on tedious and annoying treasure hunts with knuckles, and terrible mech action with tails. With Sonic being the sole character the game would have been a lot better but even still the series just isn't as entertaining in a 3d world."
3,It`s fun for a little while,This game is Fun for A little while but you really don`t have to be very good to beat it. some of the levels you look for jewels and those ones are pretty fun but other than that the game is boring.Overall it would be fun for kids 10 and under.
2,Somewhat entertaining,"Sonic A2B is a mediocre game, plain and simple.___Pros___Fun 2 playerSome fun levels___Cons___Average graphicsBad cameraAwful voice actingNo four player racingTerrible storyI wish that Sega would get it throught there heads. Sonic is not a 3-d game. I loved it back when it was a classic 16-bit Genisis game. If they could make a 2-d sonic with Gamecube quality graphics, it would rock. Oh, and take out that chao garbage. It is not fun. In fact that is what gave the game a 2/5 instead of a 3/5. Get sonic for the Gameboy. That is a truly fun experiance."
3,please don't play this game,sonic heros is better than this game.You might not like this game.All you do is jump and kick and run.You collect emrods and hide with rouge or knukles and scratching. Your in a robot with Tails or egg man shoting dumb-dumbs and the chao data gets boring.Don;t PLAY THIS GAME.
4,My review os sonic adventure 2 battle,"Okay,this was the first ever game I got for my nintendo gamecube. The day I got it I was so excited. It was tons of fun beating levels on the hero side, or dark side, But then I came up to a scavenger hunt and it got intensely booring. In a scavenger hunt you get to be the teams hunter, and search for three diamonds. but they give you a hot or cold method of searching, which unlocks confusion, and frustration. Like all the other sonic games there is sonics fast past action levels that are a blast, and tails robot fighting action. This time with sonic they made a new daycare type thing that alows you to take care of a little baby called a chao. With a chao you can fight karate, and have races. If you have a game boy advance and,a gba to gamecube cable you can transfer your chao's into it and get fruit and other things for them. over all I give this 4 stars."
4,Review for Sonic Adventure 2 Battle,"If you like Fast 3-D games,if you like shooting games,if you like treasure hunting games and if you just plain like cool games this is the game for you.This game has 2 parts, hero or dark.You could choose to save the world or conquer it.The main characters are a brave hedgehog named Sonic,a two tailed fox named Miles ""Tails"" Prower,a echinda named Knucles,a mad scientist named Ivo ""eggman"" Robotnick,a bat girl named Rouge and a mysterious hedgehog named Shadow.This game is fun and all around good."
5,Better than SOnic Adventure 2 for Dreamcast,this Game is the Best its even better than sonic adventure 2 for dreamcast it has better graphics and in 2 player mode you get to do more stages than before.
4,Great Game,When I first got a Gamecube I knew I had to get two games: Simpons Hit and Run (click my name to see the review) and Sonic Adventure 2: Battle. After playing this game thousands of times at my one of my friends' house I knew that as soon as I got a Gamecube this was a first choice.Total 9/10
4,This game rocks!!!,"I was a sonic fan since I was 8 years old. When my dad bought us the gamecube I was a little disapointed with the games he bought with it. He bought mickey's magical mirror (VERY BORING) luigi's mansion, and super smash bros. When I heard that there was a sonic game I asked my dad to buy it asap. I was surprised. The 2 player game isn't so fun but the 1 player is great!! I couldn't stop playing until my 2 year old sister scratched the disc."
4,"CHAOS OF THE WORLD, UNITE!",The ONLY reason I play the game is becasue of the chao (said like chow) because it's so fun. I have nothing else to say. The chao is the only ^ part of the game. Everything else makes you Zzzz. But the graphics are good. And the sound is annoying.
1,Horrid,"I loved the first Sonic Adventure game (Gamecube remake) and I only expected this one to be as good, if not better. But, boy was I wrong. It's a truly horrible game that's scattered all over the place with no non-linear progression or free roaming abilities of the original.The graphics are ugly, the camera system is the worst I have ever come across and the levels are tiresome and repetitive. Where's the dynamic gameplay of the first game? Or the cool mini-games that keep you coming back again and again? It was just ugly and garish and far inferior to Sonic Adventure. Do not buy or rent.I can only hope and pray that Sonic Heros is better because I have already bought it."
2,Pretty good but could have been lots better.,I think if there is ever going to be a Sonic Adventure 3 it better have all the characters from the first SA game and be a cross between the old school Sonic games for Genesis and the first Sonic Adventure game for Dreamcast.Sonic Adventure was one of the best games graphic wise and fun wise of 2000 so you can bet that the sequel was somewhat of a disappointment.Im sick of the stages where you have to dig for emeralds.What happened to just having a Special Stage?If Sega is going to make another game thats like SA 2 then maybe they should give up on the Sonic idea and think of something else.128 bit versions of the original Sonic games for Genesis would be really cool but unfortunately I dont think that's going to happen.
2,this is ok,i thought it was fun in the end but when you beat the game you dont want to start over im not a sonic freak so when it came out i didnt care but i bot it because you guys gave it 4 stars it would be good i dont like it that much
4,Very fun game but be warned the Cannon's Core is for experts,"This game is very cool and you can also play the stages and bosses youve already beaten without having to start the whole game over on a new file.The reason I took one point off is because the ""Last? Story"" aka The Final Stage is way too difficult.I cant even get past the first level on that and I think even if you do get to the Robotnik part of that story youll probably lose and have to play the stage over again as Tails.I probably couldnt even get past that part with a guide.The Final Chase and Final Rush stages were hard enough even though it was more fun than difficult to play against Shadow in the Hero story and Sonic in the Dark story.Also I miss the first SA and hope it gets put on the Game Cube."
2,"Fun,at least for a while","I for a 2 month period loved Chao,Sonic and friends. The 2 player mode is awesome. Eventually, I was sick of cute chaos,shadow and Sonic. Now I feel like it was a waste of money. It's sitting on my shelf all dusty. Rent it for a while and then you will be sick of it. I recomend Sonic Mega Collection by far over this game."
3,Decent just could have been better,"this is an ok sonic game some of the levels are decent ( sonic,shadow,eggman,and tails) which consist of sonic and shadow running around an area which was what sonic was originally which is fun, and then the tails and eggman levels are when you are in a machine and killing enemies an a area which is also pretty fun, then the bad levels (rouge and knuckles) you have to go around a look for 3 gems or keys or whatever which is really pointless since you dont find stuff in sonic games you just run around and it takes forever to find the 3 gemsvoice acting is pretty decent and i wish those voice actors where still around (especialy sonic, the new sonic voice sounds bad) the only voice actor i dont like is rouge i like her new voice actor bettergraphics are decent and have this nice crisp look to it that i like, oh and you can raise a chao which i found really fun and i remember spending a lot of time there raising them, cant anymore though my memory card broke=("
5,Fast-Paced Fun...,"Sonic Adventure 2: Battle for gamecube is great. It's fun, but let me get on to the reviewing part:Good Things:-Good graphics-Fun to play-Not a game you win to 5-10 hours-Play as Dark and Hero sides.-Has a secret suprise when you win Hero and Dark-Fun raising Chao-Has a GBA cable featureBad Things:-Music sometimes is annoying, depending on which level you're on.-Scenes can get corny, sometimes-Chao are sometimes hard to raise.-Controls can get hard sometimesThat's the end of my review. I suggest you buy it, becuase it's fun and you'd win it in 2-3 days. Unlike Luigi's Mansion(Fun but easy game) or Universal Studios."
5,Great game! but I need help,"This game is awesome! If you have a GameCube you should definitely get this! But is there anybody out there who can tell me in this game what is the point of the Cardboard Box that you buy from the Black Market in Chao Kindergarten, I spent 2,000 rings on the thing and when I give it to either one of my Chaos they throw it away. Can you please tell me what it's for? Thanks."
4,A great game if you have Dark Story and Hero Story completed,"This game can be very frustrating at times and that's probably why some people dont like it but the graphics are superb and you can choose to play levels youve completed without having to start a new file.All of the Shadow and Sonic levels are amazing(as promised)but most of the levels with Tails,Rouge,Dr.Robotnik,and Knuckles just don't live up to their potential.The only levels that I absolutely hate are Security Hall and the impossible(at least for me)Cannon's Core."
4,SA2B Rocks on ice!,"I got Sonic Adventure 2 Battle 1 week ago and i decided it rocks! It is unique because you can be the heros or baddies! It even has a choa garden, to raise Chao! Sonic/Shadow levels are fast and great! Tails/Eggman levels are fun, finger blisting shooting levels. Knuckles/Rouge levels can be frustarting, but fun.Pros: Sonic/Shadow levels are pure, fun.Great music!Chao GardenCons: Knuckles/Rouge levels are frustrating.Grafics aren't that good.Get Sonic Adventure 2 Battle today!"
4,Great Fun,"Given how polished Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is, it surprises me that Sega didn't put more work into the Gamecube release of the original Sonic Adventure. Sonic 2 sports fast, furious levels with Sonic and Shadow, with plenty of secrets and alternate paths.Sonic and Shadow steal the show, but you can also play as Tails and Eggman (both in big robots,) or as Rouge and Knuckles (who have treasure-finding missions.) The Tails and Eggman missions offer some amusement, although are nowhere near as fun as the Sonic and Shadow levels. The Rouge and Knuckles levels, however, are extraneous and tedious.Still, great fun for everybody in the family."
5,Sweet game,I love this game. The story line is wonderful and a game with two to four part stories should be praised. Raising the chao can get addictive and fun at the same time. The music is great as well. You should get this. It's worth the money.
5,Really Fun,"The main game is okay. I really hate the Treasure Hunt games, and near the end you get near the frustration. Except the other add-ons in the game are fun. There are 2-Player Modes for your friends to race or duel, and there is a Chao Garden where you raise little creatures. That really gets you caught up. So overall, the game is almost really fun, but could use more activities. So buy it if you like action and raising virtual things! :D YAY"
4,Sonic+Nintendo=Sontendo(or something),"Ok, this game is pretty much the Dreamcast Version with better graphics, more multi player stuff, and Choa virtual pet things.... thats more than enough to make me buy the game! .... I've played the game for Dreamcast and it is pretty neat, but some of the ""Emerald Search"" levels end up with your controller meeting the wall. If this was a review for SA2 on DC then I would have given it 3 stars, but GAMECUBE rocks and should improve the game immensley."
4,My review,the game was great except the 2-players it should be 4-players since these systems have 4 controller ports. but i think you should make a game where sonic and mario fight. like a super smash bros. type game but sonic AND mario fight along with the other characters such as shadow and luigi. that would be a great game.this game was cool because of the battling part and racing.
5,Sonic Adventure 2 for Gamecube? Neat!,This game will be the best when it comes out. Nintendo is adding new features like Being able to make your chao go from the Gamecube to the GBA. I would really like to get this game. My friend has the Sonic Adventure for Dreamcast and it is really cool. I know this one is going to be better. I want to be on the dark side when I play. I wish this game would come sooner.
1,Dumbest sonic game EVER,"When i got this i was expecting a remake of Sonic Adventure for Dreamcast with some cool new stuff in it. What i really got was a sonic game where everything cool about sonic adventure had been removed and now you have to play through 2 characters worth of painstakingly stupid missions just to get to the only fun part which is sonic or shadow's runs through the game (which last a mere couple minutes at most). Tails isnt the tails we all know and love, he is a scientist fox that scoots around in a stupid looking robot. And knuckles...from all the games, he has a special purpose for sonic adventure 2. His purpose is to make the game absloutely intolerable, you get to use him to find emerald shards in massive levels. No running, not much fighting and a littel gliding, mostly digging into stuff...Do NOT waste your time or money on this game, it's pointless."
3,Things never are quite as you remember them.,"I loved Sonic back in the days of the 2d side scroller. But now that Sonic is in 3d I just dont enjoy him as much. Besides that there are a few other things that take away from the game:1) The graphics are good but by no means great.2) The camera angles tend to become a problem when moving around large objects.3) During cutscenes the music sometimes gets so loud that you cant hear the characters talking.4) Controls seem oversimplistic.But on the other hand the Sonic/Shadow levels are fun, the chao minigame is pretty cool and the game is easy enough for younger gamers to play but challenging at the same time."
5,By; Randy,"Sonic Adventure Battle 2 is the best game ever for any system. It has a lot of levels and it never gets boring. A must get forthe GameCube, which is much better than the XCrap and PS2. Trust me I know what I'm talking about."
4,Sonic Advernture 2 Battle,"In this game, kids can beat up baddies while going through stages and obtaining new items.-The GameJoining the bad side or fighting for justice, you can save the world-or conquer it! The many stages are of different varieties. And at the end of each stage, if you obtain the 'Chao Key' you can go to 'Chao Garden!'-ChaoChao are adorable little creatures the you take care of by giving them Chaos Drives and Animals. Giving them Chaos Drives raises one particular level, and giving them animals changes their look and raises a variety of levels. Depending on how you raise them changes their personality. Depending on who you raise them with changes if they become good or bad! Chao Garden is the first garden you come to. Then, after being unlocked, you can have Hero and Dark Gardens!This game is a recomendation."
5,Sonic is back!,"SA2B has to be one of the best games I have ever played. Here's why:As soon as you play the first level of the Hero storyline (my favorite level), you'll be hooked.With two storyline's and 180 missions to complete, you won't be done with this game for a while. There's even a secret storyline...Multiplayer modes are insanely fun. While you can only play with 2 players at a time, the amount of fun you get makes up for it. There are many Multiplayer modes: Action Race, Robot Battle, Treasure hunt, Chao racing, Chao Karate, and Kart racing.There are some pretty original ideas. You can grind down rails and slide down city streets on a snowboard while pulling crazy tricks off ramps.The music in this game is unbeatable.The storyline is very good, offering suspense, action, and even a few touching moments.You can raise adorable little creatures called chao. You can even transfer chao from Sonic Advance into your chao garden.BUY SONIC ADVENTURE 2 BATTLE NOW!!!"
3,its good but not as good as the first one,"this game was pretty good, when it comes to action, its pretty fast and the graphics are amazing, but the sountrack on this was so annoying, people who r not into that type of music might not like the game, it would of been better if they rapped through out all the levels. The fist sonic had better music and better levels, this one lacks in good levels. What happened to the adventure zones??? that was the fun part!!! it was good lookn for the levels n the first one, but in this one it takes u direcly to the levels its not even exciting, its laughable though, theres one part in the game where shadow and sonic do this trance or whatever n they start moving there hands up n down (subliminal messahe here) hahaha, its so funny, that was about the only entertainig part of the game!, but in all it was fun."
4,Good gaming!,It is a great game for kids to play and work on fine motor skills. Great game for families to play together.
5,Sonic takes Gamecube by force!,"When I first heard that good ol' Sonic was comin' to Cube, I just couldn't wait, and although I don't own the game, yet, I rented it for 2 days and lets me tell you, I needed A LOT longer! The single player experience is head-spinning edge-of-your-seat excitement that lasts for a good while in two modes: Hero and Evil. The multiplayer is emense; with treasure hunts, races, battles, kart races and Chao stuff, you'll be occupied with your friends for a while. The graphics are nothing less than Gamecube style; extremely attractive, yet simply beautiful. This is a FOR SURE rent, and a very good buy. While it is not pure classic Sonic, it is the next generation of the Supersonic blue hedgehog!"
5,A completely amazing game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best gamecube game i have ever played! It has an awesome plot and is challenging but fun. Also, the music is really good. Buy this game!"
4,"Amazing game, Annoying camera","This game is all too amazing. The gameplay is awesome and the the upgrades (play the game and you'll know what I mean) are SO cool. The only thing I can't find amusing is the very annoying camera. Although you can rotate the camera, you're supposed to go one way, so when you go a certian way, the camera automaticaly turns. Some levels are a snap, when others take a year to get through. Let me just give you a hint. If you get this game, in story mode, try to beat the hero side and THEN the dark side. Then, the game will make MUCH more sence. This game took me about a month to beat both the hero and dark side story. For any Sonic fanatic, this game is a must-buy."
4,good game,its a good game but hard at times and u find ur self doin the same thing 2 times but its worth buying
4,The truly last good Sonic game ever,"This was Sonic's very first game on a Nintendo home console.I know it's a remake of Sonic Adventure 2 on the Dreamcast,but still this is Sonic's very first game on a Nintendo home console.Too bad, this was the very last good Sonic game.After this game, the series just got worse with every new game that came out, especially ""Sonic & The Secret Rings.""But although, Sonic is dead, and will never have another good game again,this game will always be a classic.I recommend it, but stay away from the newer Sonic games! Please!"
4,Great Game,"This game is great. It has a story mode and a whole bunch of other stuff. You can play as either the good guys or the bad guys and either try to save the world or take it over. There are 3 characters and level types for each. The normal thing where you try to get from the start of the level to the end with Sonic and Shadow. Tails and Dr. Eggman have weird robot levels where you blow stuff up and Knuckles and Rouge have levels where you have to find 3 of something (emeralds, keys, etc.).After you beat that you can go to chao raising. You basically raise little chao guys by feeding them things you get from the story mode. You then can test their abilities in races and karate.It also has 2 person multiplayer that ranges from racing to chao karate. You can unlock cart racing in the story mode for multiplayer.Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is a great game that never ends for a long time. I gave it 5 stars because it is so fun and never ends."
4,a sonic must have!,"i bought this game because a friend of mine suggested it to me. I LOVE IT!!! My absolute favorite part would have to be playing with the chaos! they r so cute!!!!! i think the levels are a litle tough, (and i am stuck on the game at the moment... :) ), but i still love the game, and i still play the levels i have already beaten because they are so fun!I would have to say that the worst part of the game is the treasure hunting levels, and getting stuck. it is very maddening sometimes! lol. i hope this review helps everyone, and good luck! :)"
5,Possibly the best game i've ever played!,"Now, you know the original Sonic games, think of those, hold them in your mind, and wipe them all out, because this isn't ANYTHING like them, other than the original characters and rings, no no no, Sonicteam has added a few things, better graphics, (Duh), all new characters, Rouge, Eggman to name a few, Chao raising, (Little Pokémon type monsters, only alot cooler and less names to remember), a great 2 player mode, not like the 2 player mode in Sonic 1 and 2 for the Sega Genesis, minigames... Man, i could go on forever, but you should see for yourself."
4,Good? yes. The best? Well....,"In my 10+ years of playing video games, i have played many Sonic games. While i would like to call this one the best, i just can't. For one thing, the Knuckles and Rouge levels give me a migraine, the shooting levels with Eggman and Tails leave something to be desired, and what exactly is the point of raising Chao? Couldn't Sega add the option of whether or not u want to? While we're on the subject of Sega, it's still hard to grasp a Sonic game on the GameCube. I guess that's because Sega and Nintendo were once competing against each other.The Sonic and Shadow levels obviously are tight because they're so fast paced, but this game is lacking. However, this game offers what few other games do, the chance to play as heroes, or the bad guys.If you're a diehard Sonic fan, then go ahead and buy it. If you're not sure, rent it first."
1,NOT SATISFIED,"The game did not work when we received it. In the future, please be sure the game works before advertising it works and is in good condition."
1,I Would Rather Do Nothing Than Play This Stupid Game,"This is the worst game I have ever played. I thought it would be good since I liked the game when it was on genesis years ago, but it is a big disappointment. The music is not what I have expected it to be, and the camera angles really got me mad. It is hard to figure out what direction you are going because the screan is just spinning. My advice for you is to waste your money renting it so you can see for yourself that it was the worst game ever. I would give it a zero but i cant select it, so i gave it a one."
1,pathetic,"with this being sega's big product no wonder dreamcast failed. don't get me wrong, i loved the original sonic games, but this one is just awful. the music is horrible. just imagine some cheesy 80's wanna be rock like winger....i am very mad that i didn't listen to others and rent it first. no wonder so many are being sold on ebay.....BEWARE OF THIS GAME! wait for the new mario game to come out if you like these types of games..."
2,good but not great,"We've all seen Sonic it's been around for soooo long.Why can't you just let this lame story line go.Its the same Sonic game over and over again.But, I must say, because game cube IS the best platform this game must not he horrible, just not original.And thats why its good but not Great."
5,Best Game - Ever,"I would like to start off this review by saying that I did not buy this game but I did rent it twice from Blockbuster. I am a Trekie and in those 10 days I spent more time playing SA2B than I did watching ST:TNG. One of the things I liked about it was that not only could you save the world as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, but you could also take over the world as Shadow, Eggman, and Rouge! Plus, another thing I liked was that even if you are done with the main stories, you aren't done with the game. There are still things to do such as go to the Chao Garden and compete against your friends in multiplayer mode. If I had to make 2 criticisims about SA2B, they would be that Ohmochao gets very annoying at times, and multiplayer has to be against humans. In conclusion, this game is a must-have for anyone who liked The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask."
4,If you like sonic and adventur this is a great buy,"This game is great with incereible graphics and good gameplay. You can become metal sonic, chaos zero, and many more during the 2 player mode. I have beat this game many times, but i still have not got ""A""s on everythng, it is a fn game."
4,Smash Hit,"I haven't got this game, yet, however I have read a lot and see many screenshots of it. OK, The graphics aren't exactly what you'd expect from GameCube, but have been improved, nevertheless, it is a game which requires little strategy but intiarive and is good to get your mind off Rogue Leader and Pikmin. Fast, furious fun of the Sonic kind and is really great!"
2,OwiE,this game is fun but it makes your thumb hurt very much if u know you are a game addict please do not play this game i played it and it took me 3 weeks to beat it and imagine that i beat luigis mansion in 4 days so u know this game is hard plus u need a cup of cold and hot water to keep dipping ur finger in...Tales is the best..And the chaos
5,Four and a half my foot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"...For crying out loud this game is awesome!!!!! If I were the host I'd give it 1,000 stars!!!!!!!!!!But thats not possible so I'll settle with 5 stars."
2,Not the Sonic it could be,"Despite all the review hoopla over this item, ""Sonic Adventure 2 Battle"" comes up short considering the legacy it has inherited: the zany fantasy world of the Sega Genesis original has left its mark here with but only the main character, Sonic, who now has been reduced to but one of many in a half-hearted storyline.True: the graphics are have technically advanced. But gone is the side-scroller speed, quirky soundtrack (replaced with modern punk music), to-the-point objectives (too much puzzle solving slows the game down), and above all, effortless fun that the old ""Sonic"" was made famous for. One would be better satisfied to simply dig up an old Genesis console and ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" cartrige than play this uncreative 3-D version."
2,"Nice chandelier, horrendous packaging","Looks nice, very elegant. However, it is packaged by the factory in rotten, old, thin cardboard boxes with hardly any protection other than a shabby layer of mostly-popped bubble wrap. The box doesn't even say ""FRAGILE"" or ""GLASS"" on it. To make it worse, Amazon shipped these shabby-looking boxes (which had been all taped together, definitely prior to shipping judging from how old the tape looked) without an outer box. Not surprising, then, that one of the two chandeliers I ordered arrived smashed in a million pieces. How sad when a company makes such nice stuff but takes such little care in packaging it. Amazon should have taken notice, complained to its supplier, and put the bad boxes into a cushioned outer box before shipping to its customer."
4,Amazon review,Very good book. He really tells the truth about medicine. I was very impressed with it. He is now my doctor.
5,Yum!,"This cheese arrived in a shipping cooler with a freezer pack to protect it's flavor....and the cheese was wonderful! A bit dry and nutty with great texture, I would reccomend this to anyone who likes cheese."
3,Great towels but overpriced,"We bought a bunch of these about a year ago at $17 per towel. Contrary to other reviews they have stayed soft, thick, and absorbant despite heavy usage and dozens of washings in a home with three active teenagers. BUT ... we like the Tommy Hilfiger Luxury Soft Towels better. We paid half the cost ($8), and while not quite as thick as the Grand Patrician Seduction they come pretty close, and just as soft if not softer. We don't feel the Grand Patrician Seduction is worth double the cost over the Tommy Hilfiger Luxury Soft Towels. If they were the same price, then I'd give an edge to the Grand Patrician Seduction."
5,Very nice towel,The Grand Patrician Bath Towel is very soft and absorbent. It's also a nice big size. Very nice towel.
5,refreshingly traditional,"If you are as tired as I am of canned Christmas muzak, you will find this to be refreshing, beautiful, and uplifting for the season of Christ's birth."
5,EXCELLENT book. High Quality and SUPERB Photography,"James Spada has published his best book yet. Not only are the nude men in this book BEAUTIFUL, but James Spada's use of light and shadows in his photography is remarkable. These are some of the most wonderful specimines of fine art photography I have ever seen."
3,This could have been so much better!,"The photos are beautifully arranged, and it has the ambience of an antique photo album. It is obviously anachronistically irreverent--the men look like they broke into a Victorian house and took dirty pictures. I'm not saying it was a bad idea, but it lacked imagination. The sonnets give the photos an oversincerity that Shakespeare would have found a little pretentious."
3,Disappointed in item,"I ordered this gripper only to be sent a different one that is nothing like the one picture. The gripper part is flimsy, only has one side that opens, and does not open as wide as the one pictured. If they didn't have the one pictured any longer why didn't they just cancel the order instead of sending me one that I didn't want. The cost of shipping is too much to send it back so we are stuck with it not to mention wasting what I paid for it."
1,"Boy, did they steal my money!","I could have developed this game in an hour. DON'T BUY! COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY! Unless you enjoy flight dynamics that make you feel like your riding a pogo stick, or the complete lack of substance that this ""carrier aviation"" game provides. I only did two approaches and couldn't take it anymore and shut it off. JUNK!"
4,Wolverine vs. cyber,"In this short GN by writer Peter David (who apparently wrote EVERY marvel comic from 1990-1996) and stellar artist Sam Kieth, Wolverine meets up with his arch nemesis Cyber! After years of assuming that Cyber was dead Wolverine's greatest fear comes true and it's another brawl to the death. A so so story by the usually boring writer is made up for by the amazing art of Kieth. A must have for the art work alone."
4,Mathematics For Elementary Teachers,"This book is a very well written. However, some of the example problems provided are confusing. All in all, this book is a great tool to have if you are going into Elementary Education."
3,good but difficult,"I found the ideas in this book very interesting, but the text was very difficult to understand. Thank god for a great teacher who could explain better then the book."
5,"An brilliant album, done by 2 great singers.","Personally, I never used to really like the Warren Brothers until I saw them in concert. They were phenomenal!! On top of that, i got to meet them in person. This CD ""The King of Nothing"" shows their true colors. From songs such as ""Strange"", ""Moving On"", their title track, to the emotional ballad ""Thats the beat of a heart"", this CD could'nt be any better. This is not a traditional country group, however they can still hold a place in the country music scene. Give or take a few more albums, and this group will be up there with the big ones. Great job on this CD, Brett and Brad!!Total CD time: 43 min"
5,"""That's The Beat Of A Heart""","This is such a good song! The video, the singers,etc. you just can't beat it. Everything is perfect about it. I hope me and my boyfriend (future husband) will walk down the aisle to this song at our wedding in November."
4,This book really helps your attitude,"Going into this book I really didn't know what to expect. I was pleased with the outcome because it is definitely a good book to help you get your mind right and your attitude right. Although most of the principles in this book are common knowledge for anyone who knows how to control themselves, it is a good refresher and will keep you in line."
4,The fundamentals of success!,"This book teaches the fundamentals of success in all aspects of life, moral principles are the most I liked in the book."
2,James Allen???,I guess I missed who actually edited this book. There may be pieces of James Allen but it's kind of confusing. some reason I feel like I have been duped on this one. There are good principles in this book but it's not resonating like As a Man Think etc... Did somebody else write an update to this and not put in editor notes. Is there some other James Allen. Definitely not an original.
2,Very unimpressive,"Aside from the atrocious editing in the Kindle edition that others have already pointed out, this is just not a very good book. It has nuggets of truth and inspiring passages, but it also contains utterly absurd statements. Allen romanticizes a world that never was and frequently demonstrates a shocking level of naivete regarding the world that is. In hindsight, I would not have wasted the time or the money."
1,Megaphone looks good but does not work,"What a disappointment! I tried to avoid a cheap megaphone. I wanted something that could be used by an adult, not a child. So I did some hunting and found that Fanon made (so I thought) good megaphones. This short-range unit appeared to be perfect, even when I unpacked it. But then I saw the battery compartment, with the plastic cover required to ""pressure"" the batteries for electrical contact (some sort of cheap toy?). And then I saw the volume control, another crappily-built control. Here's what happened: 1) The megaphone did not work unless I kept one hand continually pressed down on the battery cover. 2)The fidelity was AWFUL, include feedback screeching. 3) The crappy volume control managed to stop the feedback only when set close to zero.In summary, Fanon must build quality megaphones but this is not one of them. This unit looks good but works like a cheap toy. (Yes, I did return it.)"
2,Disapointing for the serious reader.,"The most disappointing thing about this book is the title. The word ""encyclopedia"" suggests something fairly detailed. The book is just barely over 100 pages and is printed with large letters. It is a ""monograph"" rather than an ""encyclopedia"". The saints listed are almost all Greek or Latin. Almost no space is given to Slavic saints. However, it is a very easy read. Kids and elderly persons with bad vision will have little difficulty with reading ""Encyclopedia of the Major Saints and Fathers of the Orthodox Church""."
1,Bent leg after 3 hours,"This pogo stick is rated for kids 80-160 lbs. Within 3 hours of receiving it, our's leg was bent.My heaviest kid is only 90lbs!It seems I have received a dud model?Should I return it, or have it replaced?"
2,11 Year Old Girl Cannot Use Master Flybar,I ordered 2 Master Flybars for my granddaughters' Christmas presents. One is 11; the other 9. Neither one could use the Master Flybar because they were not heavy enough. My son is going to use one and I plan to return the other. Maverick size is more appropriate for light weights.
3,"boing, boing, boing","My daughter loves it. She is 10 and a little under the 80lb min so getting it to bounce is tricky. Had to show her how to jump on with both feet to get it started.The end caps on the handle bars popped out after an hour of use. The foam on the handlebars twists with use as well and will likely tear away over time.However, these concerns are minor considering the low price."
4,best present,"We bought this for my 10 year old son's best friend (who is 11). They played with it for hours. My only mistake was not buying one for my son and his little bother. I plan to buy another and the smaller version for my 6 year old. I read the safety concerns by other reviewers. We will keep check on the bottom tip and order a few to have on hand, so we can replace as needed."
5,awsome,"I have used many pogo sticks in my time, I am a 37 year old female (yes i bought it for myself), and this pogo has bounce. I was very impressed with the quality. There isnt anything negative I can say about this product.The shipping was the fastest I have ever seen.highly recommended"
4,worn out pogo,My son got this as a gift and loved it. It just dose'nt hold up. The inner sleeve that moves up and down with the spring as you jump became scared and rough. My sons weight falls in the middle for the rating for this toy so I do not think that was the problem. My son had alot of fun it just did'nt last long. Needs to be made alittle better
4,Durable Pogo,This pogo stick is very well built and worth the money. The handlebars seem a little close together and I wish they were longer but my niece and her friends love it. Not good for anyone under 70-80 lbs because of the heavy duty spring needing more weight to make it bounce. The best pogo stick I found for the price.
2,go pogo?,"I purchased this for a 8 1/2 yr old. They loved the look and idea of it but has difficulty getting it ""worn in"". It is very stiff to use and I tried to get it worn in before giving it --it is not easy. I wish they did this at the factory. But is is something to have for sometime and maybe will be determined enough to get it to the point of being just fun. (pay attention to wt. limits)"
1,poor quality,My son weighs 90 lbs. this product is rated up to like 150 lbs. the first time my son tried this product it bent. We have bent it back several times but the quality is poor. I expected much better. And it bottoms out with just a 90 lbs. boy jumping on it. I am going to try to return it. He is very disappointed.
3,Good buy for the price,"My daughter loves her pogo stick, the only down side is the handles started to unstick. She only played with it for about a month tops, but at that price it was to be expected."
1,"age range 63 yra old, or 185 lbs",Do NOT buy this for a child. There is NO adjustment for the spring tension. this is WAY to HARD for an adult of 185 lobs.much less a child age 7.
2,pogo problem,It is well made but is too stiff for a seven year old to use. She can't get any bounce out of it. I haven't been able to find an adjustment of any kind yet.
1,Honesty,"I am rating manufacturer of this product not product itself. I am so mad to them that, I request Amazon to stop them of selling all products manufactured by this company period. They don't have any kind of quality instection and responsibility before shipping. I had purchase this for my 12 yr daugher's Christmas gift. We hide from her till night before and wraped up and next day when she opened package in front of everybody. We found half piece of broken pogo stick in side the box. Upper part was completelly missing. That was deartiest jok someone would play with anyone. That was heartbreaking experience for all of us and my daugher. We were waiting to see big smile on her face, insted we saw sadness and cry on the morning of christmas. Product was manufactured by SRI Enterprises."
2,Wrong Item,I ordered this pogo stick and did not get it. They sent me a different pogo stick because this one was out of stock. They told me that the one I received is a more expensive pogo stick making me think I was getting a good deal. I looked up the one I received online and it is a cheaper pogo stick. I was lied to so that they could charge me the same expensive price for a cheaper item. I have not used the one I received and I still have not been able to contact the company. Whenever I call I get voice recordings. They are hard to get a hold of. I would not recommend ordering anything through this company.
5,My Grandson loved this Pogo Stick,My Grandson love this Pogo Stick! It was built very well. I highly recommend this item to child 11yrs and up. You also should buy a helmet and knee pads.
1,don't really like it wont bounce,"Well i don't know if their is something i needed to take off of this, but no one can get the darn thing to bounce if their any thing i need to do let me know, I am 51 and we have one already just wanted another one for all the kids we have i love them, i could not even get it to bounce i thought maybe weight but that had nothing to do with, i don't like it and if i still had my box i would sent it back. i have called company and they will not replace it does not work and they said they had other's like this beware still waiting"
2,Uncomfortable to use with shorts on,I bought this for my son a week ago and he hates it. Because it is so wide it rubs against his legs and really hurts him. It also doesn't bounce well at all.
1,DANGER!!!!!!!!!!DANGER!!!!DANGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT GET THIS TOY READ THE FIRST REVIEW DON'T LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIKE IT. IT MAY BE FUN BUT IT IS NOT WORTH DIEING OVER AND IF YOU INGNORE THE CAUTIONS I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO WEAR A HELMET,KNEE GUARDS,ELBOW GUARDS ETC."
4,As good as the Bogo at a way better price.,"My son was bummed when he opened the Flybar on Christmas morning because he was expecting the Bogo. After reading reviews on the Flybar, it seemed this was a better product and the price point was certainly better. He is very happy with it now though, even though he claims the Bogo jumps higher. For me however, that's all the more reason to go with the Flybar because the higher the jump, the harder the fall. ;-) I would definitely recommend this product. Very sturdy, well made and loads of fun."
4,"Good, not Great","The Foam Master is a very good beginners pogo stick. I personally own a Flybar 800 and a Motostick, and i find the Foam Master a great way to pull of challenging/ technical tricks. Because of its size it allows for easy movement. I would recomend this pogo for any beginner that is interested in doing tricks. I personally started off with a Motostick, and found if you are able to learn some tricks on a Motostick, when you get on a smaller stick, you will be able to pull of a lot more tricks. This is not an alternative to some of the higher end products, so i would recommend this as a junk pogo, to crash/ fall alot. The durability is also nothing to behold. The shaft and hanbdlebars will bend easily, but like i said this is pretty much a stick to try new tricks on before you risk denting a nice pogo stick. For pogoist who are interested in the sport and beginning i would recommend this pogo stick more than any other one (that is unless you feel like buying a vurtigo or flybar)"
4,Good Spring....,"In general it is fun and easy for me to use. I am 5'3"" 125 lbs and it is not quite as intense as I had imagined. It is rated for up to 160lbs and I can easliy bottom out on each hop, so not quite as strong as I had hoped but still a good workout!"
3,age sensitive,"The pogo stick was purchased for my 8 yr. old granddaughter. The age said it was for this age child, but she is not heavy enough to make it work. My adult childen did fine with it. But I'm sure she'll grow into it."
1,One month use,After only one month of use by my 8 year old the rubber end had dissapeared. Luckily no one was hurt. I read other review to see that we are not the only one that this has happened to. There have been some that have resulted in injury. Hopefully the manufacturer will get this straightened out but in the mean time I feel it was a waist of money
5,master pogo stick by flybar,"very sturdy, excellent shape! Grandson loves it! he's a bit heavier, and this is sturdy enough for him, yet gives him exercise!"
3,Flybar review.,"It is a good pogo stick, but didn't support my son's wieght. He weighs about 135 lbs. It seemed to support him at first, but then it wasn't as spring after just a few jumps"
4,hours of entertainment,"Our son has enjoyed his new pogo stick, often competing against friends to see who can get the most consecutive jumps.The Flybar Foam Master Pogo Stick works well for kids. The weight capacity might prevent some adults.The first unit we received had a few flaws - the rubber pad on the bottom was skewed, and after one day of usage there was a streak of greese on the stick below the footpads. Fortunately - Amazon replaced the unit quickly, including shipping costs and so forth.Overall- we are happy with the unit"
2,Do not wate your money,This toy will break in an average of 2 months if used more that once a week. (...)
4,Lots of fun,Would be a 5 but the handles foam has a flaw on one side. Love the color and the work-out!
2,Poor quality,"Not made we'll. it did the job, but for the money spent, we expected much better quality. Plastic end caps fell off, and unit arrived rusty. I'd pass on this one."
2,Hard to use,"The pogo came assembled and ready to rock but golly is it ever hard to bounce! I thought my kid was just too small but I couldn't even get it to really bounce either. My friend ordered the exact same pogo for her son (8 years old, like mine) and had the same problem. Kind of a shame because it is not so flimsy like other pogos I've seen but the kids can't really use it. I would return it but we pounded all over the street trying to make it work so it is no longer unused. Total disappointment and I am out 50 bucks."
5,Super fun! Super gift!,"I recently purchased this pogo stick for my grandson's 10th birthday. It is very sturdy, made well, colorful and turned out to be loads of fun for him. I would recommend this to anyone looking to give a child a unique way to play and have them achieve a bit of exercise too. AA++"
5,Arobic Mania,This pogo stick was perfect weight wise for the average teenager. Another more durable pogo stick proved to have a spring that my son couldn't push down adequately. This one has endured hours of abuse and still goes on hopping.
5,Great Product,"This pogo stick is great, I got it for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas. It's durable and its jumps pretty high, it seems as if she hasn't got off of it since she opened it. She weighs about 97 pounds so it works well. The only bad thing about it is that it's a little noisy when it bounces but it doesn't seem to bother any one."
4,FUN GOOD VALUE,i bought this for my 10 year nephew and it is a hit! he loves it as well as his brother and dad - great value - the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is one of the handles is bent up a bit - could of sent it back - but the kid LOVES it so we fixed it for him
5,Great fun!,"I got this for my nephew and he loves it. Other reviewers said that it doesn't hold up well in the long-run, but I think it will last as long as my nephews attention for it. Grab the fun while it lasts!"
5,Nice pog stick,"Since my son received this for Christmas, it was like a new toy for everyone that came over as it's a blast from the past. So, it's had plenty of use, and it's holding up great. I bottom out on the thing, but I'm sure that's because it was not designed for someone 190 lbs. But it still works just fine for me also."
1,Don't buy!,"I purchased this for my 13 year old sons birthday. He is average height and weight (115 pounds). This product lasted less than one week before the plastic separating the outer sleeve from the inner broke and now it is useless! I'm checking into returns but, not sure I want to spend the 20$+ to return it just to get another that will break just as easy. Very disappointed!"
5,wut i learned in one day,"in one day friend showed me how to use this pogo stick and in the same day i had mastered it.i think it is the safest thing to use outdoors and it is really fun!!!!!!! i enjoyed using it so much that my friend could not get me off it , and i think the funnest part was......how high i went.......well if you get this pogo stick..........have fun"
5,Flybar Foam Master Pogo Stick,I got this for my 11 year old son for Christmas. He loves it.He and the neighbor kids take turns seeing who can jump the longest. I love the exercise he's getting.
3,"Needs more ""give""","My 9-year old son was excited to graduate to a larger pogo stick but was disappointed that there was no ""bounce"" to this new one. Even when I attempted to jump on it (and I'm at the higher end of the weight requirement) I could not get the spring to give more bounce. We added some WD-40 and noticed a very slight improvement. Hopefully in time it will get broken in and bounce like a pogo stick should ... but kids should be able to jump right in to the fun when they receive a new toy."
1,piece of junk!,"Purchased by and for our 11 y.o son based on another recommendation. After two weeks it began falling apart. Amazon replaced it quickly with another one; which also started falling apart - sheer pin snapped, then foam started to split as screws began poking throughVERY disappointed in quality. Called Flybar and they said - those things are made in china - they just use our name. really? no comment other then that?will not buy another flybar product. Amazon refunded purchase price minus shipping which was very disappointing."
4,Great Pogo Stick - Terrible Shipping,"We bought this for our granddaughter's 10th birthday. She LOVED it. Make sure you order some of the extra rubber tips. She wore the first one out in about a month.I would have given this a 5 star review, but the condition of the box when it arrived was TERRIBLE. It was shipped in the actual pogo stick box - no outer protective box. There were numerous holes and tears in the box. The whole bottom portion of the box was almost totally ripped off. I was surprised that the pogo stick hadn't fallen right out!"
4,"Good pogo stick, arrived damaged but I fixed it","A good pogo stick. Looks like good quality with replaceable parts. Kids love it.One complaint is that ours arrived damaged but I was able to fix it. The problem is that there is practically no padding or protection of the stick in the shipping box. It is put into a thin plastic bubble bag and then into the cardboard box. It appears ours was dropped from a considerable height on a top corner which pushed one the handles down about 1/2 inch. I was able to bend it back by putting it upside down on the floor, putting my foot on the bent handle, and pushing sideways to bend it back, with considerable effort. Theoretically, you could return it, but that's a hassle."
2,Good while it lasted,"My son was very excited to buy this pogo stick, he did his research and then used his own allowance to purchase. The pogo stick appeared sturdy when it arrived. The pogo stick performed well, he was happy with it while it worked. He was able to use for just under a month when the spring actually blew out of the pogo stick while he was using it. Luckily he was not hurt when this happened. This would have been good to know before buying this since he is now out the money and is not able to use the pogo stick.It is worth noting that my son only weighs 85 pounds so it was not as if he was too heavy for the thing."
3,pogo stick,"I got this pogo stick for my son, as he was turning 9. Of course he doesnt have much exp with pogo sticks, and is a smaller boy, so his weight isnt enough to really pogo it well. I tried but it is not big enough for me. Im sure he will grow into it, but i wish i had gotten maybe a smaller one so that he could bounce it easier."
3,Pogostick,"I was excited to get my 9 yea old a NEW pogo stick. It came very well packaged . But when we opened it, it looked used. Or more like it had been left out side. It was scratched around the bottom area, prehaps where it was hastily put together. And had surface rust around the bolts. Looked more like I purchased it from a yard sale rather than an Amazon vendor. The item was listed as ""new'"
5,great,"My 11 yr old had outgrown his pogo stick, as it didn't jump very high. This goes very high, and he really enjoyes it."
1,Does not fit all vehicles as described,"This speedo cable is listed as a fit for a 1990 Toyota 4runner, 3.0 automatic. This is not true. Though the transmission end does fit, the speedometer connection is the wrong size and will not connect to the gauge cluster.Frustrating to discover this after routing the cable through the entire vehicle and not have it compatible. The connection looks the same at the cluster end, but is too small to go over the connector on the gauge cluster."
2,very disappointed,"While this is a nicely made book, the content is very disappointing. Pope had a wide-ranging career, and designed several fantastic buildings. Many of his residences were very fine, and this book does not adequately document them. Even working with the handicap that quite a few of these homes were demolished, I think that the authors did not provide nearly enough exterior photos, especially photos taken from different vantage points, to justify an expensive, large-format book. More floor plans of the different levels of more of the houses would have helped, too. Perhaps the biggest flaw was giving equal weight to a number of quite mediocre houses, houses that for the most part did not represent any special moment of innovation or composition. The writing can be repetitive as well. I will keep the book because it is a decent source of information on Pope's Washington, D.C. townhouses, but I suggest others try the books by Pennoyer and Walker."
2,It's ok,Not the greatest item on the market. It will work but I was not impresed and will probably never buy another.
3,Great for the price,"I purchased this because the glare from my computer was killing my eyes. The glare is better than it was but still pretty bad. I don't know if paying more money would have gotten a better product but I would rate this one as ""okay."" It's better than nothing but doesn't entirely fix the problem."
3,"3M antiglare filter for 16"" - 19"" monitors","I ordered this for my widescreen monitor which has a diagonal of 19"" and when it arrived it was obvious that this is designed for one of the square CRT monitors. I broke the plastic frame off and now have it taped to my screen, leaving a few gaps on the left and right hand edges. But the filtering itself works well. They should put a better description of the measurements."
4,screen filter,"I was suffering eye strain from viewing my computer flat screen, so I purchased and installed this filter. There is a difference, but I do still suffer some eye strain by the end of the day. Be sure to take measrements of your screen to insure correct fit. Installation is simple and easy. I was not having a problem with glare from lights, so I cannot say if the screen would help if that is your problem."
1,wrong one,its nice but ordered the wrong one and need to return it it is a very nice unit but it wont work on my 20 in ch hp flat screen monitor
1,THIS ANTI GLARE FILTER DOESN'T HELP[,"This item DARKENS THE SCREEN MORE THAN PRODUCING AN ANTI-GLARE RESULT, DID NOT CUT THE GLARE ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I AM TRULY SORRY I BOUGHT IT - JUST DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT'A ADVERTIZED. IT IS STILL DIFFICULT TO SEE WQHATS ON MY SCREEN."
2,Not suitable for window light,"I took a risk in buying this glare filter given the extreme lack of information available from the maker, and having received it today I am incredibly disappointed. Not only does it NOT protect my eyes from the all of the light in my office window, but it actually makes the reflected glare from my window much worse. The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because I should have scrolled further down through the user reviews to see that other people had warned about it being ineffective against window glare. Had 3M actually provided this information I would have seen it."
1,No good,"This filter not only made my screen have more glare, but it is so big and bulky and the bottom clips kept falling off. It's going in my garage sale this weekend! Don't bother with it."
1,3M anti glare screen disappointing,"This may work fine for some people - but not for me. The lines on the screen that filter out the glare were spaced out to the extent that they were visible to me and distracting. After a morning of using it, I had a headache. I left off using it for the next day, tried again and the headache returned. I returned the product to Amazon, and purchased the Humanscale version from another supplier. Very much more expensive but a vastly superior product"
2,Thin material and runs small,Shorts run small and are made of very thin material. 1970's styling as well. Price was cheap enough I didn't waste time returning. But would not recommend buying unless you are doing so in quantity for a team.
5,Great comfortable shorts,"Shorts purchased for wife, great price, fast shipping. Wife loves these shorts, comfortable and exactly what expected. Same shorts she wore at cheer camp years ago."
4,Comfy!,I think these would work better on a younger gal than myself but they're still good for the gym and around the house. I think they run small so you may want to go a size up.
1,Girls or Womens,I'm usually a Med so I got a Lg to make sure they were cozy as I wanted them for just wearing at home.I am returning the Lg and getting the XL only b/c I wanted cotton and they are fairly well priced.the sizing is VERY off though. go up at least 2 sizes ladies if you are planning on buying them.
3,Short but comfy,"I bought several pairs because they were cheap and I just needed some shorts for the gym. I bought grey, black, navy, and green. The colors are pretty much accurate to the pictures.The material is thin, but I prefer something light-weight for working out. The elastic band doesn't bother me at all.I will say they are SHORT and SMALL. I generally wear a small and I ordered large for these (though a medium probably would have worked too). And they are very short - as in ""be careful when you're stretching"" short. I tend to wear them around the house all the time though since they're super comfortable."
3,eh...,"It's just a short. Quite mediocre in quality, hence the 3 stars. I didn't have high expectations for this short since I was trying to meet a minimum total for an offer and I would only use it to lounge in. The material is a bit more rough than expected. And the red is much brighter than in the pictures. The only major issue I may see for others is the discomfort that may be caused by chafing by the inner elastic band."
2,russell shorts,i have purchased shorts like these for a long time and these are by far the worst in quality...they are too thin and shrink too much. it is kind of a bumber because they are the only ones i can find in white. hopefully they will change the fabric content so the quality will be better...
4,nice shorts,"Shorts fit very well and are comfortable. They can shrink a little, so I dry them without the dryer, just by laying them flat, and they do dry quickly and retain their shape. I think they are better than the other comparable brands of this kind of short, like Soffe, and you really can't beat the price."
4,Love it....,"I have several pairs of these shorts and I love it. The size does a run a little bit small so I would go for one size bigger. I am into cheerleading and that is why I got these shorts. They are very comfortable. They are good for everything though, not just cheerleading. They are a few inches above my knees when not rolled up but it gets smaller when I roll them up. The only this is that with my black ones, the stiching is coming off. I'd recommend this to anyone."
3,Great system.....poor directions,"I bought this system as a suprise for my kids. It showed up in record time and I was very pleased with that. I was also pleased with the price. However, I am NOT very pleased with trying to put the thing together. I read the directions thoroughly and located all the parts necessary to put together just as instructed to do. Things were going fine until we figured out that when you put the poles together the way the directions and arrows instruct.....you are actually putting them on BACKWARDS!!! This isn't very fun since you can't get the poles apart now and you can't just unscrew one thing and turn it around. It truly is a great system look wise, but putting it together is a whole other story. Oh and poor customer service from the company for help as well."
2,Assembly instruction is horrible,"This basketball goal set looks really nice in the store, and I am sure that I will like it once I have it set up correctly on my drive way. Well, it's not standing on my drive way yet! What happened was that I screwed up and made a irreversible mistake in ""Step 1"" by connecting two pole sections in the wrong way. I am so glad that I bought it from a local store which kindly let me do exchange.I may not have a Havard degree like Lin does but I am from Taiwan too. How come I have problem following the installation instruction!"
3,SOLID BUT NOTHING SPECIAL,ASSEMBLY WAS ONLY 1 HR 55 MIN FOR 1 PERSON. BACKBOARD IS FLIMSY BUT DECENT. SLIGHTLY OVERPRICED BUT GETTING A BETTER DEAL ELSEWHERE IS UNLIKELY. OVERALL MEDIOKER. ;)
2,Great Value but...,The system is great for recreational play at home once it is assembled after the frustrations. I was happy to get it for $154 at Amazon.The board is Polycarbonate which means the ball will NOT bounce back as a board made of Glass but you cannot expect a Glass board at this price anyway.The setup was ok. The instructions that came with the system was good and sufficient in putting this together. Just make sure to read it properly and refer to the diagrams and notes in each step. It also helps is organizing the different parts in the work table before beginning to put it together.Two parts were missing and I have been waiting for a week for the company to send them to me and still not arrived. The system is just sitting in the driveway without the hoop.Overall a great system to play in the driveway but be ready for frustrations.
1,Utter disaster!!!!,"We ordered this for our son for Christmas. Needless to say it came with at least three missing parts... one was the wheel to the base which we had to request in the mail...the other two where bolts and screws which we were able to come up with ourselves. To top everything off there is a leak in the base so my husband is repairing it with mighty puddy. If it were up to me I would return the darn thing!!! Unfortunately, after all the work my husband put into getting it together he doesn't want to return it."
4,A struggle to put together but a very solid basketball hoop,"Our children love their new basketball hoop but to put it together was quite a struggle. It says on the instructions: 2 capable adults! But for us it was a family (4 persons) undertaking and everybody played a role in the assembly! We had ""fun"" when comparing the different languages in the assembly manual. I can guarantee that you assemble a different hoop depending on what language you follow. So much for globalization!The stand is very solid, quality material and easy to adjust the height. It is not really portable since it is heavy (even without the water in the base).Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend the Spalding system."
4,How about Amazon sells instruction booklets too,"Lets just start with this, do not expect to start this and play an hour later. I feel I am very competent with putting things together, and this was a challenge. Many times I had to back track and do a step over again, instructions are very vague and pictures even worse.That being said, the overall workmanship is great. Backboard looks like the ones the pros use. The ease of raising and lowering the hoop is very nice. Kids love it and I cant wait till its warm again so I can beat them at some Horse!If you got some patience and are ok with assembling things then I highly recommend this hoop, if not you might want to pass."
2,Spalding Portable Basketball System,The system arrived with a missing wheel. Spalding did send a replacement wheel one week later. I put the system together by myself in about three hours.The directions were not the best. I was very disappointed with the backboard. The polycarbonate is only an eight of an inch thick.My ten year old son has enjoyed shooting basketball with this system(I guess that is what matters most)but for me as an adult there is not enough stability with this system. I will be surprised if there is any longevity or endurance with this system. Plus the base leaks.Update: The durable polycarbonate backboard lasted about two years before it split or should I say opened a hole as big as the basketball.
