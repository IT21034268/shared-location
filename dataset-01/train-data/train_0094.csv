2,Not a happy bunnny,"Okay, saw the rave reviews for this product, then bought it for my birthday. What a dissapointment! The right speaker has a high frequeny rattle which gets really annoying on a unit which is supposed to produce bass with no distortion. So I took it back, was given a replacement, and it sounded exactly the same! Im going back today to buy the sony equivalent, all i can say is im gutted. The unit has great features, if only they hadnt messed up the sound."
1,Warning about MP3!!!,"If you are looking for a boombox to play your MP3 CDs, look elswehere--this unit can't do it.Big mistake by Philips."
4,An excellent (but not perfect) product.,"If you are looking for a portable CD player that sounds really good, then this attractive, but rather unusual styled, product is the machine to buy.Even without the dynamic bass boost system operating, music played on this system is very ""rich"", and about the best I have ever heard on a portable Radio/CD player.I was a little disappointed with sound quality from the FM tuner. Mine suffers from slight distortion and just noticeable background hiss, even when tuned to strong signals. But you have to listen pretty carefully to hear it.The ""Power Meter"" is a bit of a gimmick as it displays ""internal"" signal strength, and not the output power to the speakers.I have owned another Philips potable Radio/CD/Tape player for a long time, and the only problem I have had with it is some of the mechanical slider switches and equaliser controls are starting to wear out. This model doesn't use sliders, so I am expecting to be as reliable as all my other Philips equipment."
4,Solid boombox!,"I am impressed for the $$$. Remember people, this IS a boombox, not a home system, so I wouldn't buy this as your home entertainment system! I would recommend for anyone for their apartment/dormroom, garage workshop, patio/deck, office, etc. Great sound for a boombox and a great deal for the $$$. Great wOOx bass, easy to use, cool looking. The only negative is that it is a little bulky. There COULD be a little distortion if you try to turn the volume all the way up and depending on the CD/type of music, but this is true with most boomboxes. Very Solid."
4,Considering Kate Nice read,"This book, like the rest of the series was interesting, entertaining and fun. As always, well written, with just the right balance of romance and intrigue."
4,Rebecca,"This book is entertaining with a realistic plot. Roberts makes you care about the characters and you want to know how they fare. You always want to turn the page to see what happens to your ""friend""."
5,I've loved reading all the Stanislaski books...,"...and Considering Kate was no exception. Kate Kimball is returning home. She's opening a dance school in an old building which is sorely in need of renovation. Lucky for her Brody O'Connell is around to help her out. While he's renovating her studio, she sets to work renovating his heart.I loved Kate. She's a forthright, determined woman with a capacity for love that can't help but win over Brody and his son, Jack. Considering Kate is a fantastic read, and a great opportunity to revisit the cast of favorite past characters!"
4,Great Fun,"This is the final of six in Roberts' Stanislaski series, the warm-hearted, hot-blooded Ukranian-American family.This was the best of the bunch, and there were many elements to savor: the author's usual humor and warmth, the parents (formerly leads in their own romances) relating to their adult children, and the character cameos from other series entirely.But what made this a stand out entry was the role reversal in the romance. The hero was the single parent, struggling financially and emotionally unwilling to risk. The heroine was the famous professional, financially secure and the one who made all the romantic advances. I LOVED KATE!A feel good read with a non-traditional bent."
5,Consider this a hit!,"CONSIDERING KATE was NR at her usual best. A collector of out-of-print Nora Robert's books I have been a fan of The Stanislaski's for years! Getting to revisit them now was fantastic! Kate sure did grow up to be a spunky, well grounded woman and she sure finds her match in Brody. This book left me with my usual grins and sighs, and a little in love with a boy named Jack. Kudos, Nora!!"
4,considering kate,excellent work from nora roberts. one of those book you don't want to put down but keep on reading. thanks nora
4,Nice,I did like the story line very much. It was so nice to hear more about the Stanislaskis!The series was long but pretty good.
3,Not up to Nora's usual standard,"This book was sopmewhat disappointing. I ALWAYS read Nora Robert new books, but this plot of this one is too recycled. It's a continuation of the Stanislaski series and she doesn't go far enough away from the original books. This book is not up to the standard of the first books or her J. D. Robb series. Maybe she's trying to write too many books at once."
1,Disappointing!!,"Ms. Roberts did a poor job on this book. I was literally going to sleep reading the book. Considering Kate is very similar to Taming Natasha. The plot was incredibly BORING. However, I enjoyed Ms. Roberts' other Stanislaski books, ""The Stanislaski Brothers and The Stanislaski Sisters"". Ms. Roberts' writing style is very excellent however, her story plots are becoming very similiar."
3,Considering Kate,Considering Kate is Nora's latest release. As a longtime devoted fan of her books I was sadly disappointed. Her characterization of Kate seemed flat and almost by rote. She seems to be recycling plot lines as well. This book seems to lack the creativity that usually marks her work so well.
2,Not Nora Roberts' Best,"I have been reading Nora Roberts since the late 80's and reading this book was a disappointment at best. The only character that was believable was the hero's son. The charactr development for the hero and heroine had holes big enough to a fly a 747 through.If one has to read a Stanislaski book, read the other books in the series and forget this one. Considering Kate rated being thrown in the garbage can."
1,"Run Away! Run Far, Far Away!","This is cliched, sentimental, goopy pablum. I can't emphasize how terrible a waste of paper this is. Nora Roberts is a monkey with a typewriter, but this dreck doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Shakespeare. It's not Shinola, it's just the opposite, if you pick up what I'm laying down. Don't waste your time."
4,with the exception of lizzy/contortions lp falls short of expectations,"i spent much time as a nascent spectator during the ""peak"" era of ny post punk (79-81), however, most of my purchases (i bought everything that sounded intriguing) at the time were based on (au courant) whim, and less on substance. teenage jesus, mars,theoretical girls, all very ""interesting"" (cacaphonous) excursions into unexplored realms of pop, however, upon recent listening-I find their work to be supercilious/droll (the sort evoked by reading too much rimbaud/lautreamont/sade etc.). Nonetheless, enjoy the Lizzy pieces (she's a true bad-ass ""and you know that"")"
1,The Winds of Kitty Hawk,"It is a very poor transfer, it's like watching the DVD in a fog. My original VHS is by far a superior recording. Why would Amazon release such a poor product? Save your money, do not buy the DVD!"
3,Great way to learn,"The film tells the story of the Wright Brothers' struggle to develop the first successful flying airplane and then their struggle to control the rights to the guidance system. It's not a big budget film, but it does help one understand what happened. I wish they would put this out on DVD. As of this writing it is only out on VHS."
5,This program really helped me!,"I was having problems comprehending in my classes. This simple way of locating what I didn't know really hit the spot! I now look up the words I don't know and I find that I can study without, as Don says, ""tuning out."" This is a great and SIMPLE method that works for me."
4,Nice colors - Nice design,I bought the Garnet & Mahogany colors for a his and hers look. Towels are heavy and soft. Pattern is very nice. I just wish they came larger and that the ends did not shrink. I wash towels in extra hot water sometimes and that is probably why. Colors stayed true. Happy with purchase.
3,"Great author, but not a dog book as you might suspect","Bought this as a gift for my mom. She was very disappointed, as she has enjoyed other books by this author. She expected a book about a dog. She says that there is a dog in it, but it is peripheral to the story, and she did not find it particularly interesting."
3,Publisher Cast off,The book was no different than described. Was a little disappointed in the seconds appearance of the book. Obvious printing errors. Full of margin and spacing errors. It was a disappointing. Would have been nice to know more of that condition up front
5,Classical thinking in a postmodern world.,"""Cultivating Humanity"" is one of the most thoughtful examinations of the concept of a liberal education that I've read in a long time. Nussbaum tell us that Socratic questioning is still on trial, that becoming a citizen of the world is a lonely business, and that a visceral and intellectual understanding of compassion is a key requisite. This book amounts to classical thought applied to the dilemmas of postmodernism. Highly recommended."
4,Nussbaum's Defesnse of the Liberal Eduacation~My Opinion,"Nussbaum makes several good points in her critique of the liberal education in her book Cultivating Humanity. She brings under the microscope such ideals as examing our own beliefs and how we must be world citizens in order to fully understand humanity. An overall excellent book, Nussbaum makes many good points and supports her idea well. Occasionally, we are lost in the wordiness of it. I feel that some of what she had to say could have been condensed, but it detracts nothing from the book."
3,Essential for Czechophiles.,"Although some of the philosophical writings are a bit dense, this is a worthy book for anyone fascinated by Czech society and literature, and by the pre-1989 samizdat era. The content is uneven, but it is a great insight into what these writers were doing before they were free to write. Don't go looking for a Prague-centric collection, though -- it is all over the map."
4,sane packaging,I got this just because it comes in a package that doesn't dump batteries all over the floor. I hate crappy packaging. The batteries seem to work.
2,Costs To Much,After recieving these batteries and then shopping at CostCo I found out I payed 50% to much for these AA batteries.CostCo's Kirkland brand AA bateries cost far less.
4,Question about 7 year shelf life,"The price is good and the batteries are fine. The one minor nitpick is that all the batteries came with a five year expiration date, although the listing said seven years. Not a big deal, tho."
4,Good batteries,"These batteries may not last as long as others, even if they claim they do, but they work just fine for my budget!"
1,They do not work.,None of the batteries work. I tried every single one and none of them could run a remote control. When I put in a new Rayovac I bought at the grocery store it works fine. Stay away from this product/seller.
4,quality batteries,"i read up on the new Rayovac batteries and they are rated as good as Duracell or Energizer, but much better pricing"
3,corrode,"ordering batteries is supposed to be easy but when you get a pack that has a battery corroding in it you want to get the seller's attention. what I got was not a replacement but, ""I've never had this happen before"" so, I will look elsewhere for my batteries."
4,Good Resource,This book should be required reading for anyone seeking to understand and deal with allergies and allergens that often plague us.
3,"Nice idea, but could go further","This is definitely an interesting and welcome attempt to look at some of the everyday musics of the modern West. The author seems to have overlooked the large literature on music in everyday human life outside the West, or in Western folk traditions. While there is no need to write comparatively, or even to cite that research much, the book might still be better informed by lessons learned there, both musical and methodological. As a result, the book, despite its interest, sometimes reinvents the wheel and is occasionally theoretically weak."
5,Awesome Book,I needed it for my Anthropology 100 class at CSUF and it was a very good one indeed!! Filled with lots of helpful and great examples! Recommended!
5,The Clockwork Twin by Walter R. Brooks,"Another excellent story by Walter R. Brooks, written with the wit, originality and humor that makes every one of the Freddy the Pig series so much fun to read. Children of all ages and even parents will be glad to share in the adventures of this excellent classic series."
1,what a joke,"The other reviewers pretty much summed up the main problems with this video, but did anyone happen to notice that the first ""customer review"" and the editorial review are almost identical? Also, the music is praised so much because the director and composer share the same last name.... brothers?Thanks to the other reviewers (and the friend of mine who let me borrow his copy) for your honesty and helping me to make the decision to find another product to help me further my lampworking knowledge and techniques."
1,Bad Quality,"Very Bad quality all around, The disk it self delaminated, very bad music in vid. Pay the $ and get the Freeman Corban DVD's"
5,ATTENTION TREASURE SEEKERS-,"This has been my all-time favorite book since elementary school. I used to take it out of the library all the time. In it there are many different stories about hidden treasure. Some have endings, but most do not. If you like mysteries or like to hunt for treasure, you should definitely read this book."
2,Disappointing,Very overpriced and a big disappointment for someone who grew up with Hirschfeld in the NY Times. This was a used paperback for $40. I returned it and purchased the Art and Recollections one for half the price. That one is a hard cover and has more than twice the work in a much larger format.
2,Didn't work as expected,"It has lot of problem, most of time it's cartridge will not be recognozed by Leap Pad."
4,GR 8 item,"GR 8 item for kids and best thing about this books is kids can learn so quickly and at the same time, have lots of fun."
1,deceiving!!!,"If you are looking to add a microphone to your product then just purchase the microphone, NOT the microhpone with these two books. If you purchase this item then you are LIMITED to these two books!! If you purchase the microphone you can use ALL microphone enhanced books!!! My kids LOVE the microphone. It is great to hear their own voice and sounds. I give the microphone itself 5 stars."
2,Not what it is advertised as,I bought this item thinking that it is a microphone that supports different cartridges. It turns out that this item has an inbuilt cartridge that you cannot change-you are stuck with the two books that come along with it. THIS IS NOT MENTIONED ANYWHERE IN THE ADVERTISEMENTS.
4,Great Toy - Greate Fun,This is a nice toy with microphone.My daughter loved hearing her own voice and making sounds in the book. It is a great toy for gift.
4,Nice Bowtie,"I got it for a gift for a Pee Wee Herman costume so I didn't actually wear it, but it looked like a tie that would be great for a holiday formal event. It is the same as a tie you would get at a tuxedo place for a wedding."
3,OKAY PRODUCT,Used this bowtie as a last minute PeeWee Herman halloween costume. Only used once and the stitching fell apart. I ended up tying the clips.
4,Got the job done,This was for a costume and worked well. Not the best quality but serviceable - exactly what I expected for the price.
5,Great little bow tie,"I bought this bow tie for my husband to wear as Moe from the 3 Stooges, for Halloween. He has even worn it to work a few times...whatta hipster!"
4,Fairly good product.,While the order didnt arrive until a few days after i needed it it seems to be a very nice bow tie. Ill find a way to wear it another time for sure.
5,Red Bowtie,"My boys wear bowties/matching hats so having a variety of ties is a must & finding them at a decent price is great (who knows how long the bowtie fad will last). The quality is good and the red was a ""true"" red so it matches most hats."
4,Christmas bowtie,"The color is a nice red but not quite my version of a Christmas Red......that may be subject to opinion of course. None the less the bowties worked great for our barbershop quartet, singing in a Christmas event. They arrived on time and well packaged. Only complaint I had was the hook, which was fairly close to the front so it was visible when you wore it, and not covered with a little cloth tab, like my regular tuxedo tie."
1,A good reason to buy books in a bookstore...,"Do not buy this expensive notepad. Of the 200+ pages, only 50 have text on them. The rest are blank pages for note-taking, if you can believe that. The content of the first 50 pages could be printed in 6 pages if you left out all the full-page chapter headings and blank rear pages. ...When you take notes, you should:1) classify information into, (a) main idea, (b) facts, or (c) support.2) try to understand your course material.3) organize your notes by subject, topic, date, lecturer.4) make sure you read the course material BEFORE the lecture.5) review your notes after the lecture.This content is so without merit that I feel like I got dumber from reading it. ..."
3,not happy,"Found out after 30 days that I had ordered the wrong product. Can not return to buy.com as there is something in the return policy that it must be returned directly to the manufacturer. Contacted them and got a quick reply. Sent the information they asked for and now am still waiting.This product is definately not for home computers, but for work stations. Not an easy time returning for exchange or refund as the process is still not completed and not sure yet if I will get an exchange or refund."
5,Must have for any micro isv,I am co-owner in a small software company and I found this book to be invaluable. It has nuts-and-bolts information that you just can't find anywhere else. I'm just upset that the author didn't write the book 2 years ago when we were starting out. It would have saved us a lot of time and money. Don't even think about starting a small sofware company without reading this book.
4,Describes the non-coding aspects of becoming an ISV,"A micro-ISV is a one-person company which develops softwarewhich is sold mainly over the internet.This book is targeted at software developers who know how towrite software and now would like to know how to start a businesson this skill.If you are a programmer and would like to start your own businessbased on a software product, you need to change your mind-set.Now you need to think about your customers. You need to understandthe way your customers perceives your product.Your software application alone is not your product. Your productconsists of web site, graphics, payment processing and overall customerexperience.This book is about alle these non-coding aspects of starting yourown business.For me the most interesting chapter is the last one where severalmicro-ISVs tell their stories. These stories are sorted in threedifferent categories: emerging ISVs, successfull ISVs and verysuccessfull ISVs. You can learn a lot from these existing ISVs."
5,An Outstanding Resource,"I've been a ""micro-ISV"" for 30 years (if you can count pre-Internet years) and I still found a lot of very valuable information and insight in this book. I tend to not read software-related books cover to cover, usually just referring to the parts of interest. I read this entire book and added a large number of tasks to my ""to-do"" list. I wish I had this years ago!"
4,Good Book for Small Development Shops,"This book all though a book full of mostly common sense does have a lot of resource for someone starting a software company. Great thin volume, highly recommended."
5,Good checklist for setting up as an independent software vendor,"This is a good book to use as a checklist for setting up as a software vendor. Some of the specific information is out of date now (referenced websites etc), but overall the principles are sound."
5,Big Payout,"Not to recently did i get this magazine was i able to price over 333 rares, holos, and japanese pokemon cards with the greatest of ease. Its easy to see that Scrye has the best up to date prices than any other price guide I have ever seen amongst Beckett, Pojo.com and many others. What also made this magazine a big payout was the japanese pricing and ""Translations"". Its hands down that this magazine deserves 5 stars because no where else can you find the most up to date pokemon prices."
2,Innocuous Soft Jazz Version of Flamenco,"If you are looking for pleasant background music, this ""soft jazz"" take on flamenco will do. It is harmless enough, as long as you don't let it dissuade you from listening to the genuine article."
1,Extremely Mediocre,"This album is good as any proof that musical talent is not inherited.This Bechet has none of the intestity, skill or unbridled ""inspired abandon"" of his famous namesake, and this album merely trades on Sidneys' great name. The least said about the Neanderthal drumming of English Bwanna-be Martyn the better. It is sad that the great talents of Ed.Garland & Alton Purnell are wasted on such mediocrity, it is certainly an impossible task to expect them to make Leonard or Martyn swing. Another G.H.B. lemon...Maybe they should curtail Martyns ""drumming"" since his archival work carries real weight."
5,Excellent Anthology,"This text is packed with scores varying in length, form, style, & complexity. Everything is clearly displayed in the scores & the notes for each piece are incredibly helpful. This book is an easy 5 stars."
5,Helpful,this book is very helpful. it is for my form and analysis class in college. i don't necessarily like the book but it is good for class.
3,kolberg,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,cheezy,okay... if you know nothing... zilche... about paintballing and are interested in getting into this awesome sport and you want to get an idea about what's it's all about.. then yeah... this DVD might be for you... but if you've played more than 2 times out in the field... than you should NOT buy this DVD... I've been paintballing for only about 2 months (been out paintballing about 5 times)... and this DVD has a lot of information that you could read out of a paintballing magazine or website... plus... this DVD trys to teach you using amateur little kids... i was not happy with it at all... now i have another expensive coaster on my coffee table... so yeah.... save your 30 dollars like i wish i did... and go read up on it and spend that 30 dollars paintballing... i hope this helped...
3,Has Great Potential,"I'd love to give this system 5 stars. It has good station reception, pleasing sound, and looks good for a modestly priced system. Alas, as another reviewer stated, the CD trays are thin and flimsy. Worse, my CD's, which play fine on other players I own, frequently skip when being played on this system. 3 Stars is the best I can rate it."
4,Excellent System,I purchased this system for my parents. The system was delivered quickly. The unit was easy to put together. The sound is better than expected. The only I didn't like is the lack of a RCA jack input in the back of the system so I could run my parents DVD for sound.
4,Value for money,"I was looking for a mini system for my room,my idea was something neat with plenty power for 400 sq.ft. room. I decided to go for this JVC unit as I know they have a reputation for quality.I din't regret in anyway, my neighbor about 200yds away can hear me blowing tunes with this mini system.JVC - Quality all the time."
5,70's/80's Disco/New Wave Blast!,"This is a winner! Brings all that wonderful, slightly sleazy ""underground"" late 70's/early 80's disco-but-not-disco sound back in a slam-bam-thank-you-mam 2-disc set. Things like Was(not was), Kid Creole & the Coconuts, Garcons, and Casino Music. This stuff is so much better than the ""commercial"" do-the-hustle fluff playing on the radio during the same period in time. Worth the $$$!"
4,Underground Disco.,"What a great collection of rare, out of print and underground dance and disco with a little bit of the classics you have heard of before like I Know What Boy's Like by the Waitresses. Soft voiced Christina's Drive My Car is a classic gem on here. I especially love her laughing in the track. Or take French Boys by Garons. Another upbeat and energetic early 80's disco track perfect for a fun party. Fire is another fun track by the lovely Lizzy Mercier Descloux. Very 80's, very groovy. Overall a fun collection of tunes I had heard of before but never knew who it was or knew who it was but didn't own. Definitely worth owning."
4,Good basic wireless keyboard/mouse set,"This is a great basic wireless keyboard/mouse set. Works great for the price. It does not eat up batteries, regular batteries can last a good 3-4 months before you have to change them. The keyboard works right out of the box, you don't have to install any software unless you want to use the special shortcut keys, but I recommend against installing included software, it is buggy and may mess up your USB drivers. The range on this is about 3 feet, I wish it was longer, but the usb receiver has long cord so you can position it at an optimal distance for your setup."
1,Horrible high school level text.,"This is one of the worst books I have read regarding the Human Genome. The author clearly has very little understanding of basic scientific principles. This book is intended for undergraduate education, but should be packaged for the local junior high school. For those of us with a science background, a duck-billed platypus is NOT a marsupial. If I could give this book ZERO stars, I would."
2,Not Very Informative,"I was full of anticipation and excitement when I first wanted to learn about Human Genetics. However, this book left me feeling like I had only watched a show on the Discovery Channel. I did not feel like I had gotten a very in depth look at Human Genetics. Rather, I felt like I had just skimmed the surface. P.S. The duckbilled platypus is NOT a marsupial. It doesn't pouch its kids it lays them in eggs, for crying out loud."
2,Longing for a better book....,"This book left me feeling empty inside. I would of loved to delve into the subject matter, but ended up feeling lost and alone. Yah, sure I can tell you that there is a gene called TDF that is important in determining male sexual development, but the book doesn't go very far into the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that I was so desperately desiring from this book. Monotreme, Monotreme, where for art thou, Monotreme?"
1,"Human Genome, Fool's Gold","Once in a while there is a flood of books on a vogue subject. And like a river flood, you can find some golden nuggets but most of them are worthless pyrite. This book tries to buy into the new and exciting field of Human Genomics, but unfortunately it fails miserably. I didnt get excited reading this book. The effort put forth by many people to advance the field is not well presented and is lost in personal anecdotes of the author. The vision of the future is no better than one can get from a cheap B-movie. It is written like a textbook and is read as a textbook. Keep looking prospector, this book will not enrich your life."
3,NOT for use with a computer,"I made the same mistake as the previous reviewer. It turns out, this cable and others similar to it CANNOT be used to convert a VGA signal from a computer to a composite signal for a television or a receiver. If that is what you are trying to do, you need a much more sophisticated product such as the one made by startech. If your TV has a DVI port, that offers you a much easier solution as VGA-to-DVI cables are cheap and come in many lenghts."
1,IT DOESN'T work!,thought I got the wrong wire. I didn't. It just shows a staticy image on tv of my laptop trying to hook up to my TV as a monitor like your trying to watch unpaid porn on your cable box from back in the day. Could've got a s video wire instead. IT doesn't work.
1,it doesn't work,This item doesnt work. I bought it to see videos from my laptop to the tv. but it doesnt work.
3,Probably works,"Didnt work for the purpose i intended...i wanted to a VGA signal on my HDTV without using the HDMI inputs. However 'no signal' was displayed when i attached everything together. Maybe i did something wrong, who knows."
3,Go,"This book is for anxious traders who think the found the get rich quick book. 250 page book in 16 font size, half of it are charts for stocks that worked using his system. Again no testing is done. Mostly about Wilder ADX, DDI for day trading. If your day trading system is not working you may try this one. The best method is the simplist method. And the high priced books are not the best books."
2,Unreliable,"I bought the Worx hedge clipper and an extra battery in 2007. At the beginning of the first winter I put the machine and batteries away. When I went to use it in the spring, both batteries were dead and would not accept a charge. I was forced to bring them to ""Batteries Plus"" to be ""rebuilt"", and was told while there that the quality was not good to begin with. I am not an expert, just reporting what happened. The machine works great, but the batteries are a problem. Worx should address this."
2,Battery technology is behind the times,"In this age of rapidly growing technology, why is it that batteries are the weak link. These batteries just do not last very long. I have tried all the techniques given about extending the life of the batteries but on this product it has not worked."
1,WORX Battery,"The battery would not take a charge. Indeed, it appeared to me not to be a new battery. I am concerned though that my charger may be bad so rather than sending the battery back, I'm getting a new charger. If it still doesn't work after trying it on the new charger, I will send it back."
4,THE WORX WORKS!,GOT THE BATTERY IN GOOD TIME. CHARGES AND WORKS GOOD FOR A NICAD BATTERY. LITHIUM ION LASTS LONGER BUT I DON'T THINK THEY MAKE THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF BATTERY IN LITHIUM ION. OVERALL OK PRODUCT.
4,Better than the one that came with the unit,"The battery that came with the unit we bought a year ago has stopped charging, and we needed a replacement. We were a little hesitant to purchase a new one because we're afraid we'd have to buy another one next year. When we got this and charged it up, it worked better on the first use than the original one ever had. We anticipate being able to use it for several years."
1,Very short run,I purchased this extra battery after getting the worx cordless blower. I needed an extra battery because the battery life is about 10 minutes. I got this one and it has been horrible. It lasts about 3 minutes with only the first minute really blowing with any force. Bad decision or I got a defective one. NOT HAPPY<
2,If ya have 1 battery Ur screwed!,"I can't ever edge & trim a not-so-big yard with out the batter(ies) dieing yup, I have/Need 2 to get One job done. I even timed it to see how much battery life I get out of it. battery #1 33 minutes Batt #2 29 minutes. So I get a hour of use and always when going down home stretch battery 2 konk's out it takes like 4-5 hrs to charge to get 30 minutes of use?? Seriously.. Oh did I mention it was new! 1st 6 mths of I donno> 12-15 uses I would get a whole hour now half of that. I'm looking forward to my up & coming 10 minutes of use!!!"
4,WORX WA3152 Battery,"Replacement battery was one that we needed as a spare. With a yard our size and the 20 minute, or less run time, just wasn't long enough for us to complete the trimming. Would probably search out another unit which gives better run times."
5,LOVED THIS WORX TRIMMER,"I bought this trimmer WG150-1X3P For $99.99 back in 2008 It has been the best little ""worx horse"" we ever used Just today April 28 2012 the fully charged battery only ran for about 10 minutes so I ordered my husband the new 24 volt lithium powered trimmer. Now heres the guestion do I buy a new 18 volt battery for my old trimmer for the price of $53.00 or should I buy a brand new WG150 for $79.00 ?"
4,so far so good,"Orginal battery went out in less than a year. I was surprised to get an OEM delivered when I ordered this, but it is working so far so good with much more power than the original. We'll have to see if this one lasts more than a year or not?"
2,Expensive to replace!!!,Bought the cordless Worx trimmer 3-4 yrs ago. I use it maybe 5-6 times a year. Sometimes alot sometimes a little. 1st year worked great then each year after it held it's charge less and less. Now we need to replace our 2 batteries @ a cost of almost $40 bucks each.I have an 18v Ryobi cordless drill that I've had for 10 yrs still going strong and it's been used alot more.Don't know why the batteties break down so fast.And after reading consumer reviews others have had even worse problems. Don't think I'll get the Worx vacuum.
3,Worx,The item I received did not look new- it was in a taped up box and the item itself was scratched up. I charged it and it seems to work fine so I just kept it. But it did say it was new and it appeared used or at least resold.
3,A fix for worx batteries,"The worx tools are short lived toys at best, but I bought the TV special with 3 tools and a couple of battery. The batteries were worthless after a couple of months but I didn't want to just throw it all away. I made an adapter by cutting one of the worx batteries apart and saved the base with the male end. Then I took a rarely used $16 ryobi flashlight and cut out the female plug section and epoxied it to the worx plug. It looks a little weird but now I just use my ryobi NiCd or Lithiums to run my worxs tools. Although a bit more expensive, I imagine Dewalt, Rigid or whatever would work as easily."
5,On time,"Great, I really needed this item for my blower to work and it fits and I can't put my blower down."
3,"I like it ,I've got two","great if you own a yard not so big a small one like mine, not so great if you plan to use it in large areas."
1,Terrible,Received this item twice and they were both used. I ordered new items not refurbished or used. Customer service corrected the problem quickly but seemed to have no issue with the quality control of this item.
1,It doesn't last.,"Don't buy the trimmer or the battery. The battery will die within the first year and will not recharge to capacity, making the trimmer pretty much worthless. I threw it away."
5,Worx 18 volt battery for WG150 trimmer/edger,I bought a replacement Worx WA3152 18 volt battery from Amazon for my Worx Wg150 trimmer/edger. It arrived quickly and safely. It took a charge and works very good so far. It seems to be more powerful than the old one was when new.
3,Charge does not last long,The battery's that came with the Trimmer lasted a very long time. I could get all my yard trimmed with the one battery. Now I can't get it done with two. Not happy at all with the Battery's.
4,Workx Replacement Battery,"This is the exact same battery as on the Workx website, but $10.00 less in price. Workx does include string spools but these are free from Workx anytime."
2,"extra battery, no extra charger","I thought when I bought this item as an extra battery for the Workz trimmer that it would come with an extra charger as part of the package. There is really no use for the battery without the charger. The whole point of the extra battery is to be able to immediately change batteries when the one on the machine is all used up. But with only one charger, this is not possible."
4,"Fluker's 5.5"" Repta Clamp Lamp with Switch","It's great; it is just the size I was looking for. The only reason I did not rate 5/5 stars is because I had, for some reason, expected it to be just a wee bit deeper."
3,Not rated for 250 watts!,"I was pretty excited to get this and now I have to send it back, which is a hassle, because it is only rated for 75 watts. Not happy about the misleading product information."
4,decent product,"Needed a lamp for our tree frogs. After glancing at the products available at the pet shop, seems this one was a good price and works well, too. No problems with bulb burning out yet. Satisfied with lamp."
1,lousy....,"fed-ex always delivers to the wrong apartment. u.p.s. and u.s.p.s. always deliver to the correct address , so it is clearly described as apartment 2 .this has been going on for over 10 years with fed-ex. i am now disabled and finally got the package 3 days later than it was delivered incorrectly. the glass was shattered. the frame was metal and cheap looking. i am so unhappy and discouraged , i threw the package out. it was described incorrectly and packaged and shipped poorly. the worst experience i have ever had. i will never bother ordering from this company again. lousy merchandise. save yourself the trouble and order from pictureframes.com's sale outlet instead.they are wonderful. i hate fed-ex."
1,"Ertl toys should be advertised as ""For Display Only""","I did not purchase this product on Amazon.com, but I was so disappointed by the product quality that I wanted to warn others. I gifted this set to my son and within 8 hours, the steering wheel came off. My son is not rough on toys, so this is clearly a quality issue. Sadly, this is NOT the first time that an Ertl tractor has fallen apart in his hands. Ertl should address quality issues before selling any more products. I know I won't be buying any more Ertl tractors."
5,Great product,For the ebookman...to store your stories so you don't lose them you will never be upset with these. For a digital camera they are a must. My dad's deer camera uses the photo kind and he has lots of wonderful pictures stored on them. Each product has a different number and what can be stored on them. From Amazon to other sites on-line they offer lots of these for every product that uses them.
1,A good movie but a very bad video quality,I am very disappointed : it is just an old VHS tranfered on a DVD.The quality is zero. Don't pay for this!
2,"Good Subject Matter, Poorly Written","I was assigned this book for a Religious Studies Class, and while I found the subject matter insightful and well presented, the author got caught up in trying too hard to appear smart in his writing. I found myself trying to interpret too much of the writing (big words and rhetoric), instead of enjoying the book."
3,Studio versions are better,"Reunion of the Daughter of Time lineup. Starts strong with For those about too and ends strong with Stormy Monday. In between tries to recapture the magic of theValentyne Suite cd, and while these excellant musicians have a great go of it (although there is a bit too much squawky sax for me) they just don't really improve on the studio versions."
3,Wacky horror comedy,"I had high hopes for this one, and must admit I was a little disappointed. For some reason I can't put my finger on, it didn't quite deliver. Maybe it was just TOO silly and unrealistic. Maybe some of the humor, being British, went over my head.The acting was great- all three of the ""stars"" played their parts to the hilt. For a low-budget production, the camerawork, lighting, and sound were all great, as were the sets. Horror fans, presumably who the movie is geared towards, will appreciate the homages paid to such classics as ""Evil Dead"", ""Friday the 13th"", and ""Psycho"". At some point I thought it was going to take advantage of the ""exploitation of serial killer"" angle like ""Natural Born Killers"", but it didn't go there. Instead it went.... I'm not sure exactly where.Basically it was enjoyable, definitely offbeat, but nowhere in the league of ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Slither"" as far as horror comedy."
2,I'm sure some people liked this film.,"Well, I picked this film up purely by chance in the hopes that it would be another gem like Shawn of the Dead. I gotta say, I had my hopes set a little too high. There were a few decent gags throughout and the tongue-in-cheek send up to B-horror movies was duly noted. However, this film just didn't hold my attention. I got about 30 minutes into the film and wanted to shut it off as it just dragged. I kept watching in the hopes it would get better. It's an odd sensation to want to finish watching a movie since you've ""come this far"" and on the other hand want the last hour and a half of your life back. I'm sure there are other fans out there who will enjoy this more than I did, but don't get your hopes up."
2,"Some Hilarious One-liners, but...","...this one needed some more work. Some of the siliness seemed a tad bit pointless. While this film does have some funny moments, the attempt at creating black humor failed, as the propostrousness was unnecesarily overdone, the comedy did not compliment anything. The only worthwhile element of this film ended up being some stand alone scenes.Had they tried to make it somewhat plausable, they could have made something both horrific, offensive and funny, as some of the actors were alright and the script was fairly witty.The story follows a dweeby kid who is cast away as a youngen and vows to get revenge on his peers. Years later, he is an escpaed mental patient who ends up being discovered by some dorky teenage horror fanatics. They then try and make their new mental friend into a stud serial killer.Good idea, had some potential, but ultimately failed."
3,The intresting movie,This movie was not what I expected but it was very intrersting. It made me want to keep watching it and it is worth keeping.
4,Supsenseful Movie,"This movie is a good horror thirller, has all the indgedients for a classic, the good girl who tradigally dies at a young age from a brutal rape after being drugged. The imagniary friend from her youth returns, but not as what you would want an imaginary friend to return as. A good feel for the purgatory world. The classic fight between good and evil for a soul. The acting is even pretty good and the casting is superb. This one is worth the money."
3,"Good, Different, and Thought Provoking","This isn't my usualy horror genre but I thought it was worth a shot since I appreciate the work of Monica Keena. The acting was good, the movie quality was good, the plot was very good and pretty original. It had twists and it was certainly a movie that had me feeling numerous emotions. I felt sad, scared, and angry. Not many movies can do that nowadays. Anyway, if you like thrilled/suspense movies or if you're into movies about ghosts, demons, limbo, Heaven, Hell, and all of that stuff, go for this, it's certainly not a let down."
1,At least it cost as much to buy as to rent it.,"Monica Keena's colagen lips were bigger than this movie's budget. The acting was decent considering its poor script and dialogue- Way to go Monica. No monsters. No darkness. Heaven and Hell consists of nothing more than recycled scenes. Nothing is scarier than realizing how much time you wasted watching it. There's no deep spiritual realization that everyone else claims. - Overall this film was lame. Rent ""High Tension"" if you're looking for fright or ""Kolobus"" for lower budget horror. Bothare great!!!"
3,Pleasant surprise,"I had never heard of this movie before I picked it up at the video store. It definately is not the greatest movie ever made, but not a waste of time. The acting was sincere, if not great. The plot deals with a coed who goes to a frat party, gets drugged, raped and killed. It then becomes a story about where she is going to spend eternity and how she is going to get there. There are a couple predictable plot twists. Meeting her parents in the after life and her guardian angel and the soul eaters were all kind of hokey if given too much thought, but if you don't go too deeply into the flaws, you can enjoy it. All in all, I am okay with having watched it. Die hard fans of hard core horror will not like this one."
1,If you want one that will last more than a year dont buy it,"Since I cannot give it a zero, I gave it a one. I Purchased one of these drives for me and my wife. Hers broke a month after teh warranty of a year expired. I called them, they said it is a fatal error and it has happened to other people,because it was over a year they will not do anything about it."
2,The guy of the last review is one of the singer on this CD..,What's that a joke?.... i listened to the samples and ran inmediatly away from my pc!!! scary!... lol...
5,A Star Is Born,"Thank God for Mark McGuinn!! He has delivered a potent shot of adrenaline to stale, musky, cookie-cutter country radio. ""Mrs. Steven Rudy"" may very well save the format. Fresh, intelligent music for the masses delivered on an independent label that can compete with the majors. God Bless pure talent!!"
1,DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!,"Came without the wanted Mrs Steven Rudy CD. I now have a great picture of MM, but no CD. Amazon has already credited my account, but I still have no CD, and am concerned that if I reorder will have a repeat performance"
4,chippy,"I really like this song. It has a chipper beat and the lyrics are good. The video is ok. It mainly just shows a lot of Mark Mcguinn. It does sound a lot like ""Joe and Rosalita"" by Phil Vassar though (that's not a bad thing)."
1,bad,Not what I thought....It was like a track shoe...A flat....Thought it was more like a sneaker.....
3,Good for hands...,"The bristles are a bit soft and tangle easily. It does not really get under 'garden working' nails, but it does work on my hands. It's not too harsh on the skin but removes the tough stuff. I would buy another FOR MY HANDS."
1,didn't work for me,this module sure doesn't work in a Micron ZX or LT laptop. I had to send it back. Amazon was good about the return though.
5,Great Wild ornament,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas, he is a huge Wild fan, he loved it. It's very cute and looks great on a Christmas tree."
2,not really a neoprene sleeve,"This zipper case is actually padded with cheaper polyethylene foam--and only on the 2 large-panel faces of the bag only. The polyethylene foam panels are encased in a jacket of wafer-thin neoprene on the outside and nylon in the inside. Note that the edges of this bag are comprised solely of the thin neoprene/nylon shell, which I think most people would agree is not sufficient padding for your precious laptop.The only reason I don't give the ICON4-BLK bag a lower rating is that I've seen worse construction. Buyer beware--don't buy this bag sight unseen. Outer dimensions are 14.75 x 12.75 x 1.25 inches."
4,Good!,"Its good, big enough. The only thing you should know is that the zipper is grey and there is some grey fabric at the top that you cant see in the pic."
2,okay,"It was nice, but it was to small for my laptop. I gave it away to my hair dresser. He loved the gift."
1,Not as described,"I usually read reviews for everything I buy, but the one time I don't, I wish I had! This sleeve claims to fit 15.6 inch laptops, but does not fit my Dell. Plus, the quality of the construction is poor and I don't trust it to protect my computer sufficiently. I will be returning it."
2,good but doesn't fit my laptop...,"i bought this sleeve because it was chip and nice, i chose it with size too, but it doesnot fit to my laptop!"
2,Light comedy wiithout substance,"This movie has no real substance. It's really pretty awful and really too stupid to be considered good. The invisible man could have been portrayed so much better if just given a bit more thought but I guess no one really cared since the focus is mainly on silly women humping the air. I guess it would be considered light comedy/porn with as much silliness included as possible. Don't waste your money on it unless you are desperate for entertainment of a weak storyline and lots of shots of breast and women's & men's butts which is about all you're really gonna get,so if that's all you're looking for, then you'll like this movie."
1,"Nice idea, but....","I got this little pond thinking it would be a good way to ""get my feet wet"" in the water garden hobby. Quality wise the item is just fine, but in practice it just doesn't work well. The small water volume and un-insulated sides with it above ground cause the pond to get way too warm in summer, killing any plants and fish. Also, if you have pets or wildlife, forget it. Water gardens attract animals, and birds land on the edge and collapse the pond, bunnies lean on it and collapse the pond, your dog takes a drink and collapses the pond....you get the picture.You could line the edges with retaining wall stones, but at that point cost wise you may as well have bought a little rigid pond. But, if you only want it for use in your hoe, and you have no pets, it's probably a 5 star product."
2,Melissa's Fresh Guavas,The guavas were not very ripe and did not ripen over time. There were two that could not be eaten.
5,All it said it would be,This book is one of three by this author I ordered. The book brings lots of joy in its self but receiving it in such good condition and so quickly made it better!
3,Old Firmware doesn't support Seagate 1TB,"I bought this controller to support a single new Seagate 7200.11 1TB SATA drive.I had no intention of using it in a RAID configuration.As delivered the card would not recognise the drive and myPC would not boot, hanging at the SATA disk detection screen.This card comes with some pretty old Silicon Image firmware.Googling I discovered that there is much newer firmware availablefrom SII. I downloaded the current non-RAID firmware from SIIbut it wouldn't install from win XP. I finally managed to installthe new firmware by setting up a USB stick to boot the PC intoFreeDOS, then flashing the new firmware from DOS.The card now detects the Seagate drive and works correctlyexcept for one issue: If I cold-boot the PC with a reset or powercycle all is well, but if I issue a re-start from winXP the cardwill still hang at the disk detect screen. This is only a minorannoyance, however.Overall the card is cheap and it does work but only when upgradedto current firmware."
1,Does not work with Linux,"Linux support is listed, but could not make work on my system (Fedora 10 x86_64). The driver cd was a mess (disorganized), and targeted at building support into a 2.4 kernel. My 2.6 kernel has module support for the chipset on the card (Silicon Image 2114), but got no signs that the card was even connected. Returned."
2,Not a Heavy use card,Bought this card to run my software RAID 5 on my file server. Within 2-3 months the ports started to fail. its still in use but i only have one DVD drive connected so it is seeing very light duty.
1,waste of money,"Useless, does not work, no manual, not even a ""README"" on the cd, card looks used, too expensive to ship it back. I'll just keep the cables"
2,Hair puller,Windows sees card fine but drivers wont install have surfed the internet trying to find drivers that work waste of money and to expensive to ship back no more amazon for where do i cancel.
3,it's okay,"Well, in the looks dept. this carafe wins hands down. It is adorable. With that said, it does not work to my satisfaction. I usually make between 6 and 8 cups of coffee, and this carafe does not keep the coffee hot as it quickly moves on from hot to warm within an hour or so. It's okay, but a bit disappointing. I should have got one with the vacuum seal....."
4,I HATE HIM!!! (in jest),"I first learned of Scotty Anderson through a Hot Licks video. MY JAW DROPPED! I immediately took my Tele back to the store and asked if they could install the notes HE plays. I don't have them on my axe! Then I heard the CD (sigh). What can I say? Technically, it's brilliant. The song choices are unique (where else are you going to hear an old TV theme as well as a traditional folk piece together on one album, never mind the jazzy stuff). If this were a vinyl it would be worn out by now. I saw the Hellecasters in concert in Montreal a couple of years back and I was impressed. I seriously believe that Scotty Anderson is in the same class as these three axe-slingers. He combines the jazz savy of John Jorgensen, the hot-rod approach of Will Ray and the sweet phrasing of Jerry Donahue. I'm buying his new CD today."
4,The Big Easy Perl Reference Guide,"After spending about 12 hours in Borders reading Perl reference books I finally decided on this one, and I do not regret my decision. This big book is by far the most thurough and easiest to follow Perl5 reference available. I have only one gripe about this book, and that I wish the Appendix contained Index page numbers. When I look something up in the Appendix I don't want to have to go to the Index to locate a page number for that item. But it's a minor inconvenience that I'm willing to live with. Otherwise this is a great book for anyone who already has a basic grasp of Perl syntax and needs a thurough yet easy-to-follow reference guide to help in more advanced programming."
3,Not for beginners,"Apparently, this book is not for beginners. You will get lost if you try to learn perl by yourself. It may be a good reference book, I think, after I read the exhaustive listing of I/O variations."
1,SAFETY ALERT,"In case you haven't read the January issue of Consumer Reports yet, let me summarize: Corning sold Pyrex to World Kitchen, who is using cheaper glass which makes it more likely to shatter from heat. The European Pyrex still uses the traditional Pyrex formula and is as heat-resistant as ever. Consumer Reports says: ""We baked at least five samples of each brand in a 450-degree oven. All of the U.S. Pyrex and Anchor dishes shattered when placed on the wet countertop. None of the European dishes ... broke"" here's the European product:Arcuisine Elegance Glass 2.8 Quart Rectangular BakerI just bought one. Now, should I give away my old ""pyrex"" dish or put it in the trash?"
5,Excellent bakeware,"I bought this bakeware recently, and it is very good. I like how the two sizes of the baking dish wonderfully complement each other. Thus, I can bake cauliflower in the big dish and a salmon filet in the little one. Very impressed with Pyrex!"
1,idk,Item was broken and damaged when I received it. i think that the item would have been a good investment if it wasn't broken or damaged when I got it.
3,Pyrex,"I just received today. I opened the box and washed them. When my husband noticed them drying, he said that the edges are a translucent blue which means cheaper glass/sand was used when made. The pamphlet that came with them, doesn't say what the maximum oven temperature they can withstand. I wish they would come with all pieces having a detachable lid for storing leftovers in the refrigerator."
2,Jingily-Jangily!,"I wish I could give this issue a strong recommendation. The performances are done in that big and boldly romantic way that are exactly what Rachmaninoff's works crave. Unfortunately, a severely out-of-tune piano in the First Concerto virtually destroys whatever momentum and style that performance can muster!The Rhapsody, so richly tuneful, luckily doesn't suffer from this fate and the fine, straightforward performance brings out all its charms. You may not find the pianism of the likes of Rubinstein, Ashkenazy, or Rachmaninoff himself here, but it is a more than adequate account.The sound in both works in close and full, perhaps lacking the lustre of the finest engineering, but certainly adequate. But that plinky-planky piano in the Piano Concerto #1 robs this issue of a big thumbs-up."
3,Requires second cable from dish,"Works as advertise. However, with the standard DishPRO dish, a second cable must be run from the dish to this box (and then a cable to the second TV). The picture on the second TV is not the greatest. I may be able to clean up the cabling after the snow melts and improve the picture."
4,one step beyond,"WHILE IT IS TRUE THE VIDEO QUALITY BY TODAY'S STANDARD IS POOR, THE FACT THAT THIS HARD TO FIND AND RARE SERIES IS AVAILABLE AT ALL IS THE TRUE WONDER, IT SEEMS THE PRODUCER OF THE VHS VERSION, JUST LET THE TAPE RUN, WITH MINIMAL EDITING, THIS HOWEVER MAKES IT EASY TO OVERDUB.THE STORIES ARE MAGNIFICENT, AND STILL BRING A CHILL WHEN THE THEME MUSIC PLAYS, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE SIXTIES WHEN LAST I SAW THE SHOW, I THINK ANY ONE STEPPERS, WOULD TRULY ENJOY THE VIDEOS, AS I HAVEDOCTORLUM"
1,Poor Quality,"While the episodes from One Step Beyond are classic and wonderful, the quality of the videos themselves is quite poor. If the orignal film had dirt on it scratched, or there was a break in it, those effects showed up on the video. The sound at times dragged. The fading in and out scenes were handle in an abrupt manner and not in a smooth flowing fashion. It's a real shame that the company that produced this video set didn't do a better job. I was truly disappointed."
4,one step beyond 5 episodes,"I was happy to find the episode, Night of Decision, it is about George Washington at Vally Forge. The tape was very good, but it was supposed to have 5 episodes and the tape I received only had 4 episodes. (1-Night of Decision, 2-Make Me Not a Witch, 3-Vanishing Point, and 4-Moment of Hate.) 5-The Riddle was not on the tape I received!! I was very disappointed. I remember watching these episodes on tv. The stories are all true, and it still amazes me that they really happened. The story about George Washington should be shown in every school across the U.S.A. It really showes that this country had Gods Blessings !!"
4,Outstanding for the price,"Purchased this porcelain coated non-stick cookware amid reports that other types of non-stick cookware might release carcinogens when overheated. This set is outstanding for the price. Each piece is designed to heat evenly and the porcelain coating is smooth and impossibly easy to clean. The lids included are sturdy and the whole set is asthetically pleasing in its gloss black finish. The plastic cookware included is pretty basic and unimpressive, but that's not the reason anyone would buy this set in the first place. I'd recommend this set to any home chef. Very happy with my purchase."
2,A real lightweight,"When I lived in Okinawa Japan, my husband brought home a couple ofWearever fry pans that were wonderful. Just the right weight to let you know you had a pan in your hand but one that wasn't made of cast iron. When we returned to the States and I was in need of a new set of cookware, my thoughts and eyes went to the old frying pans and I ordered the set. What a disappointment. These are so light they feel like plastic. I don't dare leave them on a hot burner for too long thinking they will either warp or melt. They are about 1/16th of an inch thick instead of the 5/16ths the old ones are and just don't cook the same. The only positive is that they are very easy to clean. Back to the drawing board for another set of cookware that feels real."
5,Excellent service,"I received the score 10 days afater my order, although the@notice of delivery was told 45 days later for regular international service. The book (Complete score for Correli's concerto grossos) is beautiful and clear for our daily ensemble use. Moreover, the price including shipping cost was much lower than that in the music stores here in Japan."
5,Easy and Fast,"I purchased this item over a year ago, still works great! Made my old PC a ton faster.just wish the odl ram wasnt so expensive. but compared to others, this was the cheapest"
4,One Deadly Night,"I found this book intriquing. I couldn't put it down. Of course, these murders took place in an area where I live and I was familiar with the case, plue I knew all the landmarks mentioned in the book. Everyone I know wants to read this book and it is being discussed everywhere I go. Recommend this book for anyone living in or from Southern Indiana."
3,So Sad,"This book seems to want you make a decision on either guilty or not guilty. It is a story of what happens when a person gets power and uses it to their own advantage. The court room part is a bit monotonous and i found to much focus on the lawyers and not enough on the victims family. In the end it is a true tragedy and a loss of two beautiful children , and a loving mother. They deserved better."
4,GUILTY!!,"I also bought this book after seeing a dateline special on this case. David Camm was a lucky narcissist who wanted more. Unfortunately, much more happened with this case after the book was written. After looking up more information on the internet, my personal theory is that Mr. Boney was there for a very simple reason; not only was David Camm going to free himself from a marriage and child support obligations, he was going to emerge a hero by killing the man (Boney) that he discovered in his garage. I believe I saw an interview with Boney in which he states ""he pointed the gun at me"". I hope the terror in his children's eyes haunt him until his last breath."
5,Very well written. Good Book.,"I enjoyed reading Glatt's account of this homicide. Very well written and researched, it is another written rendition of someone's hormones and conscience going out of whack."
5,Lovely,"This book is thoroughly enchanting. I remember seeing the play on stage on New Year's Eve (my birthday and the day on which the story takes place) when I was a kid in Germany. Later, I read my sister's copy.I just bought the English translation and read it with my husband, and I was very impressed with it. There is a good deal of rhyming going on in this book and the translators took great care to capture the feeling of them as well as preserve the rhyming structures.What a great book!"
2,It was alright,"It seemed like it was a shallower version of a Dr. Seuss book. I thought it was going to be more imaginative than it was. ...and I don't think it holds that high a place, especially compared to all the other books that Ende has written. It seemed that he pushed this book out too fast and didn't take enough time with it. Or it is totally just a children's book, only for children."
4,Easy to picture the prairie through Borland's eyes,"This book is a memoir of Borland's childhood growing up on the High Plains of Colorado south of Brush and Gary early in the twentieth century. It was not an easy life with the harsh weather, little rain, and endless hard work; one needed to be constantly resourceful to run a homestead then. Borland captures the difficulties--and also the joys--of such an existence very well."
4,Classic HK Gangster film,"To start I was searching for this movie for about 2 years , after seeing the first movie Rich & Famous. Finally I found it here, and it was worth the wait . I was not disappointed . I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes HK gangster movies. Plenty of Bullets and bloodshed with a good touch of drama makes Tragic Hero a great watch."
1,Unusable on Kindle,This book has no pictures or they are hidden away somewhere. I never did find any. The descriptions are just not of any value without the pictures. If the pictures are all together and hidden away how do you find them to identify anything.To use a guide in Kindle format the pictures need to be close to the descriptions or you are trying to jump from front to back of the book and you can not just bookmark then go back on a Kindle.
3,South Texas,"Good text book for classifing any fish found in the Gulf of Mexico by families, but not a quick picture reference book for identifying your catch. ... If the pictures had been better in ""Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico"". I would have given it a five stars rateing."
2,Fish Identification,"The book is written for college study, however, the pictures are of less than good quality. Many of the fish were dead for quite awhile before photographed. This isn't the best source if you're looking for a book to help you identify fish of the Gulf."
2,Disappointing,"Yes, disappointing is the word. More of an encyclopedic book that one that provides an interesting naarative on the fish or even better, information useful for catching them (habitat, preferred bait).Houston Chronicle writers raved about this. I disagreed. Would have returned it if it wasn't so much trouble to ship it back. Wish I'd have bought it from a local store, could have returned it right away!"
5,music lover from Oklahoma,"Do yourself a huge favor and buy this CD. This is by far the best live band I have ever seen. I have been watching these guys for 4 years now and they still blow me away at every show. HW 377 is a great CD but don't stop there. You have to pick up Live and Loud from the Wormy Dog saloon and Carney. These guys are getting huge fast. Buy the CD and if they come anywhere near you go to their show, you won't regret it."
5,Wake Up,"If you like to rock and you like country music then this is the band for you. Not only do you want to buy every CD they have recorded but you wish they would cover ever song that you love. A band that expands on the studio recordings shows an artist's ablilty that is second to none. I hope CCR does not get too big that the North Carolinaians do not have to travel west of the Mississippi to ""partake"" in their music. If you do not like loud a** kicking music that leaves everyone screaming for more, then you just wasted you time reading this review because I can't make you like these guys, I can only tell you what you are missing!"
4,"Good, but not their best.","I was saddened by the break-up of CCR, but I continue to enjoy their music. This is good, but not their best."
5,keep it simple stupid,"very good - i suggest looking at other guitar players too, to avoid sounding exactly like Joe Passa very wise teacher, makes you re-think jazz guitar in easier terms"
4,The real stuff,"Recorded in the 1950s. Papa was one of those founders of traditional jazz, playing sporting houses in Storyville, etc. There are a lot of rough edges on this, but the music is as authentic as you get."
4,Worth The Money,"This is a great buy for this rifle! Its just a solid built little air rifle that will get the job done - no problems. Shoots fast, packs a punch and is pretty accurate as well. The only thing I have an issue with is the pump handle itself. Its plastic? Dear Daisy, Why would you do this? Everything else is metal and or solid wood. Plain stupid - Talk about a week link! Although I must say, It has not posed a problem yet, but it sure bends when you pump it. If the handle was metal then 5 stars. For the money - I like it! Its not awesome but this is easily my #1 choice of all the others out there in this price range. Trust me I bought a couple ""junkers"" and returned them before this one. I'm keeping this one for sure."
1,This product is junk and unsafe,"I bought the Daisy 22 cal rifle expecting some standard in quality.The safety doesn't work - it WILL fire on safe. How bad is that??This item should be made illegal on that point alone. Craftsmanship does not exist in this item. Normally, I will be fair. I was as fair as can be, and gave 1 star. I would have given a more negative rating if it were possible. I do not want anyone to get hurt. To restate, the safety on this gun does not work! Do not buy."
1,so creepy,"spoiler alert:So a magician says he'll give Little m a ride in his ""magic moon machine""?And the kid goes with him?I think Little m should have got out his machete at this point...What's with all the kids hooking up with random adults in this series? c,m,q,s..."
2,Storybook Classics,I thought there would be more than one Curious George DVD. Most of the titles I had never heard of and my 2yr old did'nt like them either.
2,Only Okay,"This album was only okay. There are some enjoyable tracks but most of them had very monotonous lyrics. I tend to like Japanese music when the lyrics are sung in Japanese but most of the tracks on FPM Best were in English and very banal as a result. Not surprisingly the tracks that I did like were in Japanese, Portugese, and French.I'd say if you can get this cd for the price of a normal one, then it's worth the money. It's definitely not worth the money otherwise."
5,soothes your throat,I have a post nasal drip and this is the only thing that gives me relief. I have diabetes and need sugar free. I like the flavor and am happy to get it delivered to my door. It works for me and I checked with my doctor and he said it would be fine to use.
3,Looks good however..,I bought the necklace and bracelet combination to match. I wore the necklace 3 times and the clip already broke.
2,silly fun,"A collection of clicheed and unbelievable characters meets on vacation in the Caribbean. They have so much fun that they regroup in various combinations at various locations around the world... until various members of the group start dying, and the book turns into a convoluted whodunnit.The plot is leakier than a sieve, and the cast is totally implausible. I almost decided to stop reading half way through, but finished it and quite enjoyed the over-the-top ending!"
1,Worst video I have ever seen,This video is made by people and kid rock has nothing to do with any of it. It is just a bunch of people telling corny stories about kid rock. Worst thing I have ever watched and I am a huge kid rock fan. ZERO stars!!!!!
1,kid rock-complete story,"This was the biggest WASTE of money ever!!!!! This should have been called ""KID ROCK THE INCOMPLETE STORY"". I should have known that if this was not being sold at regular stores or on Kid's site that this was an unauthorized piece of junk. I made it through an agonizing 15 minutes before taking it out and throwing it in the garbage. I wouldnt even give this away. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. All KID fans need to wait until he decides to release a REAL DVD."
1,total crap,this waste of money has no Kid Rock music or videos.just some people who 'say' they know him and talk about him.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID
3,magnets/,"I really expected more from this product. The magnets are really small and did not work as well as I had hoped it would. Well live and learn. It looks good and practical, but not efficient."
5,Beam me up Scotty,I don't know if this crap really works but got it for the wife and thought they probably didn't have to pay the Chuck Norris look alike model as much as the real deal.
5,Great Purchase,The magnet package is complete with magnets and wraps. Works great for relieving pain.
3,"So, so.",I really believe in the healing power of magnets but the velcro wrap is uncomfortable. If you use the magnets by themselves they work great but the velcro wrap doesn't fit well.
2,Did not seem to help,"I have used magnetic therapy for healing previously and with other items, I have received and been aware of the healing benefits - unfortunately, I did not find that with these particular magnets."
3,magnetic therapy set,"The magnet are difficult to use on some areas of body. In order to use on lower back, I had to create some semblance to a belt. Only then, was I able to use."
1,calling all the dogs,"Lucky for Ray Manzarek that he met with Jim Morrison on Venice Beach that fateful day, for his talents in film are not to be found in this banal hack-flick. They should resurrect the show MST3K for this movie alone. If you want a good laugh at Mr Manzarek's expense, see this movie, otherwise stay away. I can guarentee that Jim Morrison, Ray Manzarek's idol, would have been disgusted to learn that his name was used in the opening credits as writer of this trash. Morrison did not write this script, as R.M. mentions in one of the extras sections on the dvd, but had only mentioned a scenario in passing. R.M., the forever opportunist, tries to cash in again on Jim Morrison's name. Ray Manzarek, have you no shame?"
1,"A long read, little substance","Hauser invokes Noam Chomsky's language facility as his model for a ""moral organ."" I found his arguments to be very, very little more than a few simple assertions for the existence of this organ as a component of the human brain. More importantly, Hauser failed to follow Chomsky's argument for the relationship of ""human nature"" to moral judgements. Much of this text mimics the very vague ""Natural law"" arguments."
5,A Reasonable Basis For Moral Systems,"This book, in part, presents a basis for why we have moral systems in the first place. It is worth consideration."
1,Perfect Irony: A Scientific Cheat writes about Morality,This book itself is a perfect example of irony. Dr. Marc Hauser has been found to have faked his published scientific data:[...]
2,Terrible writing,"This book is about a very interesting subject but it's been nothing but misery to read. I think Hauser must have actually decided that the key to writing readable, engaging non-fiction is to NEVER walk in a straight line. So we have him wandering here, and there, and everywhere. The burden is on the reader to figure out what he's really up to. What specific moral instincts is he postulating? What's the evidence that there are instincts? How is his theory about moral instincts like Haidt's or Pinker's? I've been trying to get through this for ages and I might...just...have...to...stop."
1,Very disappointed,"I really wish the fascinating topic had been tackled by a better writer. The syntax is convoluted and frequently garbled, so any understanding can be gained only with a great deal of rereading and inference. The Hobbesian and Rawlsian interjections seemed like a lot of intellectual masturbation.Hopefully someone else will tackle the subject in a more coherent fashion."
1,Not worth buying,I agree with other review...total waster of time and money. Don't bother. I could not even figure out the story line and I watch a lot of Korean drama.
2,Food Guide?,"The reviews are mostly weird ramblings about whatever, and the little bit of food descriptions are really gross. If things like ""pancakes and some dead pig products"" or ""get the duck if you like eating stuff you can see at the park"" or ""a hot dog that will sit in your small intestine for weeks"" or ""Thai that won't burn a hole in your colon or through your tounge"" or ""you probably don't care which vegetable it sprung from"" make you actually want to eat, then you won't have a problem. It makes me feel sick."
1,Boring & Useless,"A friend bought this book for my birthday - thank god I didn't pay for it. I'm sure she meant well, as did many other friends who gave me a few guides for Las Vegas as I visited there for a holiday last month. All I can say is that out of all the travel books I had with me, this one was by far the most useless. Outdated listings (by a few years I would discover when I asked a few locals) shallow writing and really off suggestions from this writer made this book a real stinker."
2,bad typesetting,"Negative Remarks: While this book maybe full of useful information, it is difficult to read. The type is set 14/18 with half inch indents on paragraphs. Rule of thumb, 14 point type, 14 point indent. I felt like I was junping to the next page when I started a new paragraph. It would be easier reading to have set the book in 12 point type, with 14 point leading, and 12 point indents.Positive Remarks: If the typesetting weren't so bad, the font chosen for the book was very nice."
4,This book is wonderfully helpful.,"A close friend of mine has fontographer 4.0 but no user manual and he never learned how to use it. I've tried to learn it just by messing around, but to no avail. The program is not self-explanatory. I found Moye's book at the UW art library and started reading. Three hours later (pg. 100) I remembered I needed to eat some food. I was thoroughly impressed with the ""morals?"" of type design he presented along with the how to. He stresses the quality of the product, which has been lost in the quantity of typefaces today. Who would imagine a software book could suck a person in. Listen to me, I'm rambling. Anyway, check it out. It's a keeper."
4,BRING IT BACK! BRING IT BACK!,"I could not agree more, gret software lousy documentation. This is an essential tool in the graphic arts/design arsenal, it is only appropriate to have high quality documentation to go with it! Stephen Moye is at the top of his game on this, I have seen it and want it!"
2,This was a waste of money,This really doesn't work. It isn't worth the money and I am sending mine back. It couldn't find even one stud in my new home.
1,Simply does not perform its intended task,"Be forewarned: This product does not find studs in plaster walls, period. It might be a five star product for paneling however. I can't really say. Hope I deterred some from a wasted purchase."
2,Stud finder,"The magnet in this stud finder is so small and weak that even when I put it on top of a drywall nail that I can faintly see, it barely detects it."
5,A Great Session of Real New Orleans Jazz,"Absolute gem of a session. Whether or not the food and drink contributed, the music made on that cold day is absolutely wonderful. Kid Sheik, Paul Barnes, and Earl Humphrey make an exceptional front line and all sound inpired. The rhythm section just kicks it along in fine fashion, Barry Martyn providing the extra spark that puts the life into this one. It's a great selection of tunes. ""Cryin' Time Again"" stays in your head forever.Location recordings like this one were always a gamble. A few of them, fortunately, captured the true essence of real New Orleans jazz in its most ecstatic and memorable form. This is one of them. Well recorded, with a warmth, presence, and atmosphere that connects you to the time, location, and excitement of the moment. Recommended."
5,"Great Book, Great Series of Books","I love the ""food of"" series of books and so far this one is my favorite. A couple of years ago I was completely unfamiliar with Indian food until trying different various things at Indian restaurants around town. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to cook it at home. This book has helped me learn a lot about the ingredients used in Indian food and the techniques of cooking Indian."
2,love the art work!?,"this is a great compendulum of classic indian recipes, with great photos, descriptions of the regions and food. some hard ingredients to locate and maybe its my cooking (although I am an avid cook) - the end result was rather bland. Internet recipes seem to work better. I was hoping for great experiences and felt it was lacking in the end."
5,very good,"i liked it. Being an Indian myself i can say that recepies are very authentic. already tried some of the vegetarian recepies. very good. book came in nice condition too. it took a little longer then normal to receive it, but came within the range of expected delevary."
2,Original version is better.,"Fr. Alban Butler is considered one of the greatest English Catholic writers. His Lives of the Saints has become the most important work after the Bible and the Imitation of Christ. But this new edition by Thurston and Attwater has destroyed much of the beauty of the orginal ""Lives,"" and for this reason Thurston was strongly criticized by Pope Pius XII. The original, unadultered 4 volume set is still in print under the title THE LIVES OF THE FATHERS, MARTYRS AND OTHER PRINCIPAL SAINTS from St. Bonaventure Publications, and is priced significantly lower than the new edition."
1,"Eh. More like ""What if"" thinking than real short stories","I like Ray Bradbury, but I must confess I wasn't real impressed by any of these stories. They seem more like literary impressions than short tales. You start one, and just as it seems it might develop it ends, leaving you thinking, ""So? And?"""
2,"A collection of short stories, but some are tarnished.","I get the impression that these are leftover storylines that Ray has never been able to transpose into full length novels.While some of the storys are good, some may disappoint the new Bradbury fan."
2,"It's over now.....so just leave, alright?","112 are a group akin to Destiny's Child, Profyle, Next, et al in the sense that their songs get played out, despite the fact that they have nice voices. ""It's Over Now"" is really no exception to the rule. It is the most horrendously played song on Hot 97 here in New York and probably elsewhere. No offense to them, but you see, a song can be great fun to listen to at first. But once it starts getting played, over and over again, on the radio, after a while you get sick of it, and then move on to the next best thing. I don't have much of an interest in seriously overplayed songs, I know what I like. If you still like stuff like this, go ahead, then. I don't mean to be judgmental or anything, I'm just expressing my opinions."
3,Overdetailed,"A most interesting subject, not least because of similarities between today's ""health nazis"" and the real nazis! But for the non-specialist reader (such as myself) there is a little too much mundane detail, and discussion of what paper was published in what year, who wrote it, how often it was cited ...One nice aspect: Proctor has no time for ""cultural relativism"" applied to mass murder, and is free of the prolix heavy prose many academics favor."
2,Not that great of a read,"I wasn't too thrilled about this book. Quinn was too indecisive about what he wanted. He thought he was good with Niki, but would think about Max at the most inopportune moments. I just couldn't agree with how the author put Quinn & Max in a relationship and then him & Niki get back together in the end. Sorry, but I wasn't feeling it. I've read other D. Hill books, but this was a dissapointment to me."
2,NOT A CLASSIC ZOMBIE FLICK,"The only time I've heard about ZOMBIE BRIGADE was from the directors of THE UNDEAD ( an upcoming Australian ZOMBIE flick really awesome ). They were like "" this is the only ZOMBIE flick the Australia has produced so far...""As a ZOMBIE Movies Fan, when I saw that this movie was available on AMAZON, I decided to give it a try. And well, this was quite a disappointment at first. I'm easy when it comes to Zombies but this one does not have any decent make-ups or gore F.X and the ending is just crap.On the other hand, the acting is not that bad and the plot is quite intelligent. It shows how dumb Australian Rednecks Society can be and includes some Aborigines cultural elements which is cool. Overall, you got some nice pictures like the one showing the ZOMBIE SOLDIERS walking in the cemetery.If you buy this movie, don't expect a Zombie Gorefest but an O.K Horror movie worth watching late at night."
5,Bunch nice schemes,This book was well written with different rountes that can be run from the set. If the book has contain any run game it would be a complete offense.
4,Great for a budget,"I bought this bow tie (not sure if that's one word or two--the item title isn't even consistent with itself) for a college theatre performance. It looks great from a distance and is easily adjustable. Up close, though, you can really tell that it's poor quality due to threads hanging off of it. It's great for performance or for an ""everyday"" look if that's your style, but if you need something for a formal event I would recommend laying out a little more money for something else."
4,White Bowtie,"The price is right - my high schoolers wear bowties/matching hats for dances and ""sports dress day"" so when I can get a bowtie under $10 (w/ free shipping) I jump on it. The material is a little thinner than the other bowties I've purchased (here and retail stores) so not sure how long it will hold up but for the price, it's all good. I'll probably purchase more in other colors."
3,Cheap,"There were two loose threads and its smaller than it looks in the picture. It seems like a very crappy product. Itll work, but just CHEAP."
1,not worth it,The bow tie came apart--the three pieces that make it up were no longer connected--the first time it was tried on. I sewed it back together.
4,"You only ""wear"" once, lol","For a one time event, it's perfect! Luckily for us a day was all we needed. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for extended use of it."
2,Poor quality,It had little threads hanging off of it which made it look bad. Also mine had some kind of stain on the top which deteriorated the quality evn more.
5,WHEN YOU LOVE A SIBLING UNCONDITIONALLY,"When I read the synopsis for this book I was very leery because the reading level is for young adults, but because the story sounded good I took a chance. I really enjoyed this book to no end. I loved Tree. What a sister to have. She loved her brother Dab and took up so much time with him. She truly touched my heart. I was mad at her mother for a while but then I understood what she was trying to do for her family. If you are looking for a good quick read that will keep you interested from the first to the last page this is the book for you. I gave it five stars because it was a sweet simple story and unlike a lot of books the ending was perfect. I would suggest this book for any age."
3,A bit of a letdown,"I really loved the first book in this series, and I remember being fascinated with the character of Borel when he was introduced. I was excited to hear that the sequel was all about Borel, but I find myself a bit let down. While an interesting read, this book is just not as satisfying as the first, and I would venture to call it predictable.I do admire McKiernan's use of old fairy tales in his work, and I very much enjoyed seeing some of the characters from the old tales as well as characters from Celtic lore. Adding the French flavor to his world of Faery also serves to make it more unique than many of the ""stock"" fantasy worlds we have out there already. But, Borel is still not very fleshed out."
1,Poorly written and lacks substance,"This book is awful.There's no way around it. The writing is pretentious and lacks any kind of grit, substance, or texture. It rambles on for pages about the feast the nobles ate for dinner. The writing is overly flowery and poorly presented. It's awkward, condescending, and sounds like an arrogant 45-year old hitting on teenagers at a RennFaire. The sentences are choppy and overdone to the point of nausea, and the headache you get after reading a few pages doesn't go away until you've read something better to get the taste of McKiernan's book out of your head. I wish someone had told me how awful it was before I wasted my $7.99 at the bookstore.There are much better books out there. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Which 'Bess' in most gallant?,"Ted Daniels (Cameron Mitchell) captures, tames and trains a special wild horse that he names Gallant Bess. When Ted gets injured and incapacitated, Bess is stolen from him and he has to decide whether to pursue her - or to stay where he is a pursue the doctor's lovely daughter (Audrey Long) instead. Adventures of Gallant Bess is not to be confused with the more popular, better-remembered Gallant Bess, a movie that was released in 1947. This movie is an OK Western, but not the horse movie you may be hoping for (Gallant Bess, the other one, is about a soldier who finds a horse during WW2).Staci Layne Wilson"
5,Happy purchase,Nice and fun DVD set that i have enjoyed watching. Good show for watching during free time. The show dvds Arrived quickly without issues.
4,"Season 4, the show keeps getting better!!","I absolutey love this f^ing show! Seasons 1 and 2 were my favorite, and contrary to what everyone says about season 3 its not that bad! Season 4 is pretty awsome the first 2 episodes were the paris scenes and it was kinda strange esp. that girl Chuck was dating (NOT CUTTTTEE) But this season gets back on its feet and finsihes nicely! Id wait till season 5 comes out though and you can prolly get this season for abt 20 some dollars. I paid $40 bucks for it and I think it shouldve been a lil cheaper but in the end a good purchase!!!! PS I MISS JENNY :("
4,Gossip Girl plays safe,"This show is one of my favorites since it came out. It has the perfect formula to be a good one, but it's getting old the same thing all the time.Season four shows us a more mature cast, like Serena stopping dating random guys, Blair finally leaving Chuck (for good), and Dan finally finding his own way without Serena, Vanessa being a little more independent, and Jenny just messing up with Blair (but she only appeared like in 4 episodes in the whole season). But what about Nate? He didn't had strong plots... he was just there filling some minutes of the 42 minute episodes. I hope that season five gives Chace the opportunity to show a good work as Nate, as he was in season one.Anyway, the show keeps being good but I hope it shows something new at the beginning of the new season, because it has the qualities to be a show to remember."
2,MY DVD SET WAS A BURNT COPY - NOT HAPPY.,"Since the item said ""NEW"" I assumed I was buying the original packaged box set. It looked new from the outside but when you take a close look at the discs you can tell they were printed images. So I watched a few episodes and was annoyed that the picture was very pixely (not sure if thats even a word)... definitely wasnt nice and clear like Im used to watching. Disappointed."
2,Over-rated,This show was great the first few seasons but some of the story lines got old. I think I've already sold my copy of this season.
5,Excellent Service,"Ordered all the Seasons for a Christmas Gift. Excellent Service, received immediately in great shape. Product was in Excellent Condition"
4,This season could have been better,"I'm a big GG fan, and have followed the show since the beginning. However, seasons 4 and 5 were not my favorite. I found myself bored with some of the episodes and also felt the writers were trying to cram too many storylines in at once."
3,gossip gone,"I am so over this show by now, kind of glad it is in it's final season, not sure why i kept watching it, can't stand the character Serena. The show is actually way off from the books"
3,Ehh.,Ehh-- Gossip Girl kind of sucks but I've watched the whole series so I had to buy a couple of episodes that I missed when they originally aired.
3,Probably Need To See Show,"While I have not seen London's award-winning, ""Jerry Springer - The Opera"", I purchased the cd based on the productions glowing reviews.The mix of ""colorful"" language and opera is quite interesting, funny, and even beautiful at times.Best tracks:Talk To The HandThis Is My Jerry Springer MomentI Just Wanna DanceFinale de Grand Fromage (a medley of the show's better tunes)Many of the songs are quite good, but seeing the performance would have probably increased my rating. Hopefully, the show will come to the States!Still a good buy ... just beware of the show's language (this is Jerry Springer after all)."
1,"Awful...truly witless, vulgar and awful.","I can't believe the ratings on this score...4's and 5's? Really? This score is truly awful. Written in a one-joke operatic style that quickly becomes excrutiatingly boring...wit and style is replaced with crudeness and vulgarity (granted it's Jerry Springer-inspired) in the libretto.The performances are fine, but one listena to these discs (which takes forever) and you note three things: the audience is truly unresponsive to the show (a live recording was a poor choice)...the idea itself is intriguing and might have worked in more talented hands...and, there is absolutely no reason to ever listen to this score again.I'll be truly surprised if it survives in New York, if indeed it ever makes the crossing. A major disappointment."
4,Pretty good study bible,"This is a pretty good study bible. It covers a lot of fascinating leadership concepts using scripture to draw out principles that Maxwell teaches. There are many instances of leadership passages or points that are skipped or missed, whether intentionally or unintentionally. So it is NOT an authoritative or exhaustive work on leadership issues in the bible.I would recommend this only as a resource for doing bible study on leadership. One must do their own exegesis of the text to see if the study bible's main points really match what the bible says there or if there is some tendency to insert Maxwellian ideas into the text.Generally speaking, this is a great tool that I use from time to time. As a pastor, I am always looking for good materials on leadership development. I think John Maxwell generally has some of the best material on the market for leaders, and this study bible has notes that fit in well with the rest of his 'stuff'.I hope you enjoy it."
4,Essential for leaders no matter what your religion is,"Few authors touch on such fundamental and basic truths of leadership as Maxwell does. As someone who has been in formal leadership positions for over a decade, I always learn and am refreshed from Maxwell's ability to break down leadership into it's core elements.Of course, Maxwell is taking examples from the ultimate leader, GOD. This bible is easy to read, accessible for readers of any faith and I believe is a must have for any spiritual leader looking to excel in leadership and glorify the word of God or just plain lead and serve others."
5,A must for all leader who believe in Jesus,This is a definite must for the belivers working in any organization (Christian or Secular). This has leadership concept which can be taught to the Business Students.We have always known the Bible has lot of management principles. This book brings it very clearly and in a simple language.I have become a more serious student of God's Word with this Bible.Warm RegardsAllwyn George
5,Maxwell's Leadership Bible is a must have!!,"Maxwell has a way of gleaning the best leadership principles from the greatest book ever written, so it's a win win, must have for anyone! He catches the essence of leadership skills from all the books of the Bible.Awesome! It gives me a great start to every day of my life."
2,The Maxwell Leadership Bible,"The book is much more complicated than I expected. I really like John Maxwell but I was expecting the book to be something I could sit down and read all the way through. Instead, it's the whole Bible. I will use it but not the way I had thought."
2,Poor quality,Bought this as bridesmaids gifts and had to return this item. Item more suited for a child. Pendant ok but chain thin and of poor quality.
5,best there is,"this is one of the few teach-yourself books that you'll actually find yourself following from beginning to end. the lessons are nicely graded and don't necessarily get much harder the further you go.while it's frustrating for a start that you only get 10 new characters per lesson, you quickly realize that the only way to learn is by combination.i'm on beginning chinese reader ii now, and fully intend to go through the whole series."
4,good condition,"the item arrived in good condition and the product itself i love. pages are clean and unbent, great pricing and efficient and expedient. :) thank you"
2,Used = so used!,"So, I remember when I placed in order it says is an used item but it looks new. Well, when I received it, this item looks OLD. I was planning on giving my bf as a gift but I had to hold back because is just way too used. whole butch of writings and highlights. The color of the cover is like almost fade away! However, the book content is good though. If you want to learn a new language I guess is best to get the book in NEW.So if the book is new, I will give 4 stars. My case, I don't like the extremely used condition, 2 stars."
2,Elaborate History,"Much to much detail ( people, places and events ) for a ""short history ""...Was looking for broad basics not the minutest detail"
1,Read the texts instead,"Like other readers who gave this anthology negative reviews, I was frustrated by the subjectivity guiding the selections and by the editing of many of the passages. I found a frequent disconnect between what I knew of the philosophers and what seemed to be in the passages. Having come to existentialism through literature, I was eager to explore it from the philosophers' point of view, but I honestly found myself searching in vain through many of the selections for something that I recognized as existentialist.Another issue I have with this book is that the texts are given in chronological order. It seems to make more sense to start with an understanding of Sartre and then to move back to works that appear in retrospect to contain existentialist themes or ideas."
4,A wonderful read...,"Kauffman, a modern authority on the movement known as Existentialism defines it and draws an accurate sketch in under 400 pages. If you want to know more about existentialism, this is the book for you!"
1,Kaufmann lives up to his name,"The selections are excellent, but the book is ruined by Kaufmann's philistine misunderstanding of Sartre, Nietzsche, and (especially) Kierkegaard. On this last point, see previous reviewers for details on WK's ludicrous misunderstanding. Read the authors included, but they are all available in affordable English translations apart from this atrociously-edited anthology."
2,Watch your Step,"This book is most useful if one wishes to study Walter Kaufmann. This book is a waste of time if you wish to study the writers Kaufmann presents to us. Kaufmann warps the texts to suit his own agenda. If you share his agenda you will likely not even notice that he has an agenda.""If you make people think they are thinking they will love you, but if you really make them think they will kill you. "" - Albert Einstein"
2,Needs Reprinting,"This book has wonderful content but has many quirks in its printing, it sometimes appears as a copy of a copy of a copy, the fonts sometimes are missing their tops and bottoms. It can be read, but the publisher should get an ""F"" grade in quality control by releasing this edition without a proper update. Don't let the nice cover fool you!!"
2,Pages made of Gold! (at least they're priced that way),"I seriously thought I got an empty box from Amazon, then discovered that this book is so tiny it can barely be called a pamphlet. The material appears decent, but for about the same money I could get one of Margie Deeb's books, which could keep me occupied for months, and be used as a reference for years.I realize figuring out techniques requires skill and takes a while - but if you have enough skill to follow this pamplet, you will be disappointed that you spent this kind of money for what amounts to a very few patterns. I'd skip this one, because it really wants to fit in a Little Coin Purse, not just help you make one."
4,Remember its for loom beading,I love the pictures and the ease in which all the patterns are laid out for you.I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this. I don't own a loom or know how to loom bead. It looks like I'll have to learn.
5,Everyone needs a concordance,"A concordance is an indispensable tool for any student of the Bible. This volume is an incredibly helpful resource for study especially in relation to preaching, and teaching. However, if one did not know Greek, or at least the alphabet and the word he or she was looking for it would be too difficult and time consuming to really be helpful. Money would be better spent on an NIV exhaustive concordance, or even buying both the NIV concordance from Zondervan, as well as this one. The G/K numbers correspond. Of all word study tools the concordance is most basic and necessary. This one is put together nicely and is easy to use even with only a basic understanding of Greek."
5,Incomparable Resource,Definately a must for any serious Bible enthusiast. You are able to see how many times a greek word was used in the new testament and how the NIV translated it.
2,a poor version of a British classic,this is a terrible sanitized version of a great British classic... lots of funny scenes are missing ...most of the humor is completely lost in this awful re-working..if you want a simple characterless 24 minutes for little children fine...but if you are anticipating the Mel Smith 'fun for all the family' Christmas treat - forget it! It cites Mel Smith as the 'actor' but he is not!why oh why can't the original version be released in the US?
1,Beware! This film does not have the correct voice for Father Christmas,"Beware everyone familiar with this film from British TV. This is an americanized version of what, to me, is a Christmas classic - and it ruins it. Mel Smith no longer provides the funny, colloquial voicing for Father Christmas. Instead you get a sanitized ""posh"" British accent, killing most of the humour. He hardly says ""bloomin'"" at all!"
1,Where's Mel Smith???,"This version is TERRIBLE!!! It really deserves ZERO stars. Only a milktoast (spineless, vascilating sissy) would enjoy it. ROLL ON MEL SMITH!"
1,A Total Disappointment,"Do not buy this if you are looking for the original version from British TV. We had recorded that version on a VHS tape and wanted to update to a DVD version. I failed to read others' warnings that this version has been ""Americanized"" and watered down. The British (cockney) accent, unconventional language, and irreverence are what made the original a family Christmas favorite. This version is only appropriate for the kindergarten set. I am buying a separate replacement from the UK."
3,I must be getting old,"I used to have this taped off the TV, straight after the Disney version of Robin Hood. And I didn't limit it to watching it once a year. Quite often a couple of times a year! I used to love it.I got this on the same DVD as The Snowman, another childhood 'classic', but neither of them made me feel as good as I did when I was young. I'm now an early 20 something, and it really disappointed me that I not only found both of them slow, but also boring. What happened? I grew up I guess.This shows what Father Christmas does for the other 364 days of the year. Goes on holiday and tries not to get recognised, gets drunk, looks after his cat and dog, eats too much, and prepares for the next Christmas. It's funny, when you're younger, and still believe in Santa (ssssssssssssshhhhhhhh), but there was a lot of eye rolling from me.Maybe I should sprinkle my fairy dust now, and stop getting older?"
1,Scandalous!!! ridiculizes and demystifies Santa Claus,"My 3 year old daughter chose ""Father Christmas"" from the shelf of her school's library. It seems that the whole point of this book is to depict Santa Claus as cynical, indolent, and only able to find refuge in his several alcohol breaks. Is this the portrait of Santa Claus that my daughter should dream of on christmas eve ?"
1,Very Inappropriate,"This book was just brought to me by my wife...she was reading it to our 6 children at bed time after having got it from the school library.The ""grumpy"" attitude from Santa let alone the references from him drinking and using profanity is absolutetly inappropriate for anyone other than legal adults.This book is very discerning and is a perfect example of the degration our ethics, morality and adherence to ""political correctness"".If your child believes in Santa (God bless them if they do) don't buy this book and definately don't read it to them. It'll destroy the magic of Santa and Christmas."
1,Outrageously INNAPROPRIATE and CRASS!!!,"My daughter innocently brought this book home from her school library hoping to have a nice Santa book the week before Christmas. Unfortunately, this book isn't even a story, intead it is a cartoon strip about a grumpy Santa swearing throughout his Christmas chores. One panel depicts Santa with his pants down around his ankles while using the toilet. Apparently, the only thing that make this Santa happy is booze.Not appropriate at all for children."
5,Still a favorite with our family after 21 years,We purchased this book for our children in about 1977 and it was one of their favorite Christmas books. They would make a new story up every time looked through it. Today they are 23 and 27 years old and still have a place in their heart for Father Christmas. I know it will be on our grandchildrens book shelf also.
5,This is a wonderful Christmas book and should be reprinted.,"I want to buy this book for all of my grandchildren. It has been part of my youngest son's Christmas since he was three. The book is wearing out (so am I). I'm a lost cause, but maybe a new reprint isn't. Funny, charming, and great"
2,Disappointed,The expectations set by The Snowman were high as it is an excellent film.First off this short had dialog which was certainly not expected!The animation was ok and not nearly the quality of the first.The hope was extending the Christmas joy of the Snowman to/and through Father Christmas.Didn't happen.
1,This may not be what you remember,"We have tried 2 videos from this site looking for a personal copy of a program we saw on TV in 1995. This has been scrubbed for ""G"" and does not include the funny dialoge we were expecting."
2,It's decent at everything BUT the video recording,"What this is supposed to do best is probably the worst feature of this product, which is recording video. If you don't mind low res video, and just want something to mess around with, then it's fine. It does take good pictures, but if I wanted good pictures, I would've bought a digital camera. Same goes for the mp3 player, radio, and voice recorder. I wanted this for capturing decent video, and it does a really lousy job with what they should have made thier number one priority. I didn't expect too much from this camcorder for it's price, but it's pretty bad when my brothers digital camera, which was cheaper than this, takes much better quality video. So yea, your probably just better off buying a digital camera that records video, because it'll probably be better at pictures and video than this sub-standard camcorder."
3,The DXG 505V Camera.,"I am pleased with the purchase I made and the price I paid.I am still getting aquinted with it. I have one problem, I don't know how to erase the internal storage, which is very little. If there was some more internal storage, it would have beem great. Could do with some help there."
4,I probably would have given 'Headlong' the Booker myself.,"Visited London for the first time this past August and among the highlights of the trip were reading 'Headlong' and seeing Frayn's 'Copenhagen'. Terrific blend of farce, moral ambiguity and scholarship, this is one of the best books I've read all year. Tremendously entertaining, it also includes some of the most lucid art history I've ever read. Frayn makes Bruegel's paintings come alive and his descriptions of Holland under Spanish rule are chilling. Very intelligent. Very funny."
5,no title,"What a fabulous read! Simply a page turner from start to finish, gathering momentum as it went. I now know much about Pieter Bruegel and the Netherlands in the 1560s. Would make a great movie."
1,I certainly missed something...,"I also read a glowing review of this Booker award nominated novel, rushed right out to buy it, and must confess that my copy went straight to the local library sale within a week. I thought that the art history topic would be an enthralling component of the plot. Nope. Although I don't have an intense academic art background, I have taken a few courses and was surprised that the author couldn't spark more than passing interest in a complete new world of art historians, auction houses, etc. Ah well, at least the character development should be something special. Oops. No again. Other reviews saw this novel peopled by flawed but humorous, true to life subjects. I only read about fairly unintelligent, selfish, yet surprisingly boring characters. I frankly didn't care all that much about what happened to them. This author is off my list...."
1,totally disappointed,"after the vibrant read of frayn's media-satire (it had something with ""tomorrow"" in the title?), i was deadly disappointed by headlong. what a boring book!"
2,"Good writer, not a great book","I was looking forward to reading this book, yet turned out to be pretty dissapointed. He gets 2 stars for being a good writer, sadly this book just wasnt interesting. The story grew stagnant very quickly, and seemed like a bunch of filler that I wasnt interested in. The main character started getting to the point where it seemed like verything he though about was a repeat of something he had previously said. I think the story had potential, but just wasnt executed well."
3,Oil and Water,"This novel is an awkward attempt to marry farce with art history. The farcial portions of this book are immensely entertaining with well drawn characters. The art historical portions, while initially interesting, tend to bog the plot down with overlong excursions into fairly obscure aspects of Netherlandish history. If you want well done art history, read ""Rembrandt's Eyes"". It actually would have been helpful to the average reader for this book to include some plates of the paintings being discussed, which is an odd comment to make for a novel!"
3,Please Pass the Bruegel.....to someone else,"This was my first time to read Mr. Frayn's work. There is no doubt the novel will appeal to art enthusiasts. However, I found it cluttered with too many details of the different paintings. The history sections took up too much of the novel and were, frankly, boring and not at all illuminating. The story was great, though, when we could see beyond the frames of the paintings. And hey, I object to the portrayal of the fat, quiet wife. Still, I'll look for other work by Mr. Frayn."
2,How could Kurt Vonnegut enjoy this?,The book started off well enough but went nowhere. It dragged on and on and the ending was too clean. All loose ends neatly tied up.
1,"A waste of time, money and paper!","After reading the glowing New York Times review, I rushed to buy this book in hardcover. That purchase is certainly the worst I have made in some time, and I would advise others who have an interest in this topic or in works by the author to avoid this novel. In fact, I hate to even give the book away and subject someone else to the tediousness of this work."
4,ENTERTAINING ROMP THROUGH THE WORLD OF ART,"The author, Michael Frayn, was asked in an interview if this novel would be considered a ""farce"". He answered in the negative. Frayn felt the story depended as much on circumstances as it did on the character's plans and reactions to the situations arising to meet them. I compare this book strongly with Peter Mayle's ""Chasing Cezanne"". Mayle's book can be considered a farce. The pages turn quickly as new locations show up. Frayn's book looks deeper into the art world of the fourteenth century. Pages turn a little slower, but with just as much intensity. I recommend both titles."
4,Did someone say art class?,"I was an art history major in college. I took quite a few classes in art of the Netherlands. This book was funny and light, but I honestly do not know how someone not enchanted by the process of decoding artwork, and specifically the art of the Netherlands, would be able to tolerate this book. By the end even I was skimming over the disertations on political and religious forces shaping Bruegel's life.If you are interested in exploring how addicting the study of art and its context can be, by all means dive right in. If not, dive in as well, and don't feel guilty about skipping the seemingly endless historical chit-chat - it really does not have much impact on the story."
3,History Thick/Characters So So,"This is a novel in the tradition of The Name of the Rose. Frayn is clearly more interested in the history of Breugle (which is fascinating), than the concreteness of his characters. For me the historical content was so great that it almost completely made up for the blah characters. By the end I didn't feel like I really knew or identified with any of the characters, but I was incredibly interested in Breugle's art historical period. This book didn't make me want to read more by Frayn, but it did make me want to investigate art history."
2,I wanted to like this book but didn't succeed,"This book does have some lovely writing in it. There are moments when I thought, ""ah, at last, this is going to get good"" and then two pages later I was back to feeling bored and antsy. The writing is clever in some spots and very funny but overall, those bright spots just aren't enough.There are interesting moments such as the lessons given about art history but Frayn goes into them in far too much detail such that they become boring and tedious. The characters tend to do things which are unbelievable several times over and in the end, I only finished it because it was for my bookclub and I was the one who made the recommendation to begin with."
1,"OK, if you enjoy an author enjoying his own cleverness","For readers who fancy condescending and self-aggrandizing wit, this book could be a treat. It reeks of intellectual pride and sardonic misanthropy. It isn't only the characters who are unpleasant; to judge from the content and narrative tone, you wouldn't want to spend much time with the author, either."
2,Not the Best Out There,"This was a true BEGINNERS video of yoga. It was very low quality in it's making, and the instructions were almost to easy. I felt that for the price it wasn't worth it at all. And the tape I purchased only played for 10 minutes and then started skipping and I couldn't stop it. All in all I wouldn't recommend it. I much prefer Yoga for Every body."
3,Too Many Dud Tracks,"My disappointment in Faithless' Back to Mine album nearly matches that of Groove Armada's. I love both of these artists individually and most of their own works. For Faithless (as with Groove Armada), I can't say the same for this album. Although it has some good tracks and the album is well mixed, it contains way too many dud tracks throughout. ""Mushrooms"", ""Another Night In"", ""Throw"", ""Hercules"" and ""Billie Jean"" are terrible tracks.2.5/5 stars."
3,Falls short at the end,The selections flow good until it hits the Aaron Neville track. Then the Mazzy Star and Shinehead tracks just seem like clunkers.
3,HOOPS,FLAVOR OF LOVE HOOPS IS ON THE COVER AND I AM A FAN OF FLAVOR OF LOVE SO THIS WAS A NICE FIND. PLEASED WITH THE ITEM.
3,Not her Best,"I'm a Binchy fan, but felt that this book lacked some of the really great content of her other books. Although the descriptive writing which helps you to feel as though you are there in the town was there - the characters and story did not engross me and pull me in as her other characters have."
3,not an easy read,"I have always enjoyed Binchy's books. My favorite being ""LIght a penny candle"". But this book was so difficult to get into. The characters did not come to life for me as in her other novels. She took a long and sometimes boring path to develop the characters. I found this book to be a bit of a HO-HUMMER!"
4,couldn't put it down,"a great read, fleshing out the characters in her usual style. The development of the story was great and would have liked it to continue to see how the characters lived out their lives."
2,VERY disappointing,"After reading Tara Road, I was ready to read every Binchy book I could get my hands on. This novel started out very slowly, but by the time I got to the middle, I was glad I had trudged through to the ""good part."" What I did not know, however, was that the middle was the ONLY ""good part."" The last section of the novel was so disappointing. Clare changed so much, and in ways that were not true to her character. The Clare that Binchy had made me love would not have done the things that she ultimately did at the novel's end. If she had left out the first 200 pages and the last 100 pages, the novel would've been a good read."
3,Not one of my favorites,"I have read 7 of Maeve Bichhy's novels and this one wasn't one of my favorites. With her other novels I was drawn right in with the characters, this one took me a while. My favorite is still Circle of Friends."
1,trivial and boring,"Maeve Binchy is nothing more than a formula writer. She has shown that she can write a good friendship yarn; however, she doesn't seem to progress as a writer. Novel after novel, she churns out the same type of story-line. Perhaps it's time to turn her talents towards other topics. A very disappointing read."
3,maeve binchy,I COULDN' GET PASS ONE CHAPTER. I GUESS IT JUST WASN'T TO MY TASTE RIGHT NOW... I HAVE READ SOME OF HER OTHER BOOKS AND THOUGHT THEY WERE GOOD.
2,Disappointing,"I must admit that I was rather disappointed by this book. It started off prominsingly enough, we were introduced to intersting characters, each pursuing their own dreams. However, about three quater through the book, it seemed that the story itself was unsure what it wanted itself to be. Was it going to be about dreams, pursing or giving up because of other priorities in life? Was it going to be a romance? Or was it going to become a thriller, with a slightly crazy man pursuing his love? The book tried to bring in a bit of everything and ultimately left all the areas underdeveloped."
4,Echoes,I have read all of Binchy's books and am so sad that she has gone. What a gracious gift she left behind for all of us.
4,Lovely read,"Maeve Binchy never disappointed. I enjoyed the story of the characters who sought to achieve the dream of an education, the teacher who inspired and, of course, the clash of classes in the time it was written. (It probably still exists!) Ms. Binchy can make you laugh, cry, and care. You want them all to succeed. Not all do,but the reader will enjoy discovering which ones rise above class prejudice and the resentment and disappointment of those who do not."
5,A Charming Story,"This book started out somewhat slow and I almost took a trip to boreville until about the 60th page or so when it picked up a little. From then on I was hooked! She writes with such a charming flair, that it's hard NOT to like any of her books--and I've got 12 of her books to prove it! I recommend this book very highly...take patience in the beginning, it WILL get better!"
4,Echoes,"Although, I am a huge Maeve Binchy fan I have found the last few books she has written to be more difficult to 'get into'. If you stick with it you eventually develop interest in the storyline. However,it is not a bad read - just not the page turners you can't put down that you expect from Binchy's previous novels....."
5,Great Book,"This was a wonderful book, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Maeve Binchy's novels. I have read almost all of her books and consider this one of her best."
5,Phenomenal Read,This book deftly follows the relationship of a mother and daughter as they seem to always find their way back to each other regardless of what happens along the way. It is a definite page turner and one of my absolute favorite Binchy books.
1,Echoes,"Poor, poor, poor.After rereading this book, I wondered why I wasted my time again. Maeve Binchy is usually a very reliable story teller and this book is not up to her ususal standards. The character descriptions are great in the begining but towards the end,the story line and characters fall apart. The ending is extremely unsatisfying.Choose another book by this author if you're new to Binchy,such as Tara Road. But if you must read Echoes,get it from the library, don't spend your money on it."
1,Depressing!,"This book was thoroughly depressing! I stuck with it thinking things could only get better. But they didn't. When I finally finished Echoes, I was angry because I wasted so much time reading it, as well as bummed out because of the terribly depressing story line."
1,Careful....this is a Reprint of a 1985 Binchy Book!,"I am always looking for new works by Maeve Binchy. Although I looked at the publication date before I purchased and read the description of the book, I failed to note that 2008 was the 'publication date for this edition.' This book was originally published in 1985. Be careful.....you may have already read it!"
3,Left me unsatisfied,"I started reading this book about 6:00 one night, and ended up staying awake until about 4:00 to finish it. I loved it, the beginning anyway. The characters were very real and the story was very good. I got very caught up it in, and couldn't put it down. Then came the last fifty or maybe a hundred pages. Maeve Binchy set up an amazing plot, a little depressing maybe, but still good, but the ending was no where near my expectations based on the rest of the book. It seemed like she spent months building up the story, then realized ""Oh no! I only have two days to my deadline!"" then hastily wrapped up the book in a very unsatisfying way that was untrue to the characters and very disappointing. Read it anyway, it's still a very good book, just don't take the ending as personnally as I did. I spent the next day very sad and very tired."
5,Best book ever!!,This is the best book I've ever read! Characters that will stay in your heart forever.
2,Echoes,My mom turned me on to Maeve Binchy this summer with Tara Road. I loved it. Echoes is also wonderful until you get to the end. The ending is so abrupt and disconnected it is hard to take. The women is the story is complex and mulit-layered so it's a shame that we don't get to know how she handles the next phase of her life. I'm almost afraid to try another book this one was so disappointing.
4,Enjoyed it!,"I was in bed with the flu and wanted a comforting, long story to read and knew I could count on Maeve Binchy. Great characters, and an enjoyable read. I do wish the ending gave a little more information and I felt like the last part of the book was a little untrue to the characters, but overall a great book to snuggle in with."
2,Lost interest about halfway,"Maybe it's me, but this book dragged on and on. I liked the beginning,but by the middle it became too repetitive for me. Who saw who in Dublin, who said what to who, who wore what. Like a movie that is too long, I think 100 pages could have been eliminated. How many times do we really have to hear about Angela's arthritic mother, or mrs. O'Brien looking tired? The limitations of Irish life in a small village in the 50's is very well done, as are the influences of Catholicism."
1,misleading,Disappointed because it said it was a 6 air filters but only 1 was sent. A better description should be required.
3,Useful,"This book does in fact have a number of good stories that you can use for presentations, social events, gatherings and the like. It is heavily geared and would best serve the religious setting (for a sermon) but there are plenty of other stories and anecdotes that you could use for a non-religious setting.The concept here is that you grab the book, look for a relevant topic and you have almost a thousand stories that you can pick from. This can be useful when you are preparing a presentation and most of these are funny enough for you to be able to use to ""break the ice"" in a setting like this.If you need content and you do a lot of speeches and presentations paying less than $10 for the Kindle version is a pretty good deal."
3,"Good, quick read that is well organized.","I like this book and will definitely read it a couple more times. Not all of the stories/jokes/illustrations are new to me, but most were. Some were derivations of other common stories that have been around for many years. I liked the organization of the book and that makes it worth the money."
5,Standard Mason Jars fit on all standard blenders,"I got this because I had heard the mason jars will screw onto any blender, which comes in really handy when making shakes or other blended food items. These worked perfectly."
5,Read this book!,"This is one of the first books that I read for pure enjoyment. It's about a boy named Dennis O'Mally, 13, in the 6th grade who gets a snowboard for Christmas. When his parents say that they have already done their Christmas shopping, but one of his best friends had gotten him a snowboard. Read this book, it is awesome! (written by Alex, age 9)"
3,Learning to snowboard,"A Review by JeffThe Snowboard Maverick is about a 13-year-old boy named Dennis O'Malley who loved to skateboard, ""it was his life"". When winter came the streets had got covered with snow and he could not skateboard. Whenever the streets were clear he went and skateboarded. His two best friends, Robbie and Tasha, had got into the new coolest sport, it was snowboarding. He wanted to get one know. He had gotten one for a Christmas gift and he loved it, it was the new greatest sport. He had got really good at it and by the end of the book he was really good. There was only one other person who was as, good or even better, it was Dale Morgan. Everyone knew him as the ""best snowboarder"", no one had ever been challenged by him in a competition before. They had the competition and in the end someone had one.I would give this book 3 stars, it was mostly the way I had expected it to be. It had a better ending then I had thought cause it was not expected."
4,A book for kids who like to snowboard,"I am Ross Steven W. and I like snowboarding and soccer books. Even though I am only 7, I could read the whole book. I liked the part on Snowboard Maverick when Dennis learned to snowboard. I liked Renny in Soccer Duel."
5,Snowboard maverick,This book is a really good book for ages 7-16.Its basically about a boy that loved skateboarding and then one da saw his friends snowboard and he tried it and becme in love with snowboarding.I give this book 5 stars because it has a good reason and its realistic.
5,"Learn your history, or rue the day","A rare book. It is profound, prophetic, insightful, level-headed. Christopher Dawson is one of the few authors whose books are still mandatory reading in university history circles because of the vastness of his knowldege exhibited in his books. Few writers have the ability to say as much so succinctly: reading one chapter gives you almost as much as a book on the same topic written by someone else.We need to remember that if the West saw far, it is because we stand on the shoulders of giants. The giants of our past who, step by step, brought disparate tribes, from many races, speaking many languages and coming from different parts of the world, into one cohesive whole known as Europe. We had better find out how our ancestors did it, before we lose it all."
5,Fantastic,Those 4 CDs are great. I bought '100 songs' when Erika was 6 months old and at 21 months she loves it more being able to sing some of it. The magic of this CD is the fact that is sing by kids. Its great on a long car trip!
4,"Good, economy chisels","Chisel handles are comfortable oval shaped. They seem to have good balance. Definitely not ready the way they came in cheap plastic packaging. Each requires about 30 minutes of flattening the back and honing. For comparison, my Lie Nielsen socket bevel-edge chisel costs more than this whole set and still requires 10 minute.Good steel when properly honed and keep its edge well"
3,Worth the money,"After reading the Fine Woodworking review I put together a set of 7 of these. I haven't had a lot of time with them but they seem to be a fair set for the money. I put a finish on the handles and gave them a quick once-over. They are beveled at 25 degrees not 30 as stated. They take a keen edge but come with nicks in some of those edges. The edges don't hold that well at 25 degrees so I'll take them to 30 in the near future (which is where they were tested at). This was working in oak so take that into account. I like the feel of the handles and they hold up to a mallet (so far). I think with a little work this will become a nice set, 3 stars now but they have real potential."
1,Even a novice knows the difference.,I am just starting in woodworking. I honestly hate this set of chisels for the disappointment they cause me. I bought this set thinking the wood handles would have a nice warm feel and would be nice to work with as I learn the craft. The ones that did not look like they were chewed on by a dog actually fit well. Only one of the 4 was sharp enough to cut into wood. Other users mentioned the ill fit of the brass ring and the corrosion and mine arrived in the same condition. Judging by the beat up look of the packaging it might have been the same set. I am returning them and getting a set of the Irwin blue chips which gives me 6 chisels and a wooden case for the same cost.
5,Corporate Confidential,"An outstanding book! Should be required reading for anyone planning to enter the workforce, those already in it, and those who know someone who works - in other words everyone."
3,Nothing new but still true,"This book could be turned into a musical ala ""How to Succeed in job hunting"" in disgusting ""corporate america"". Having retired from a career in HR/Legal for companies large and small, good and bad, I can't quarrel with the contents. But it still makes me sick to my stomach that American business has turned into the greed head enterprise that it is. We need to build more prisons to house the corporate criminals and Wall Street thugs who have destroyed the dignity of honest work. The least qualified inmates have taken over the asylum."
4,"""Wonderfully insightful""",This is a well written book and I highly recommend it to anyone who wish to gain insight on the human resource practices of the corporate world!
4,Sometimes bad things happen,"I think that Ms. Shapiro is a bit too downbeat for my taste. Although I think that most of her comments are essentially correct, she makes work in corporate America sound like an ruthless, unpleasant battlefield. I really don't think it's as awful as that.That said, I also feel that even if one follows her advice to the letter, one still might get downsized. After all, when the business heads south some one has got to go and bad things happen. In those circumstances, it might not matter how hard you've worked or how cheerful and appealing you are.Probably one should just concentrate on doing the best job possible. If corporate antics are to be considered, just do your best to move to a company that is doing better financially. If the business is booming, a company will work hard to retain good workers and in that environment Ms. Shapiro's advice is useful."
2,A Little disappointing,"I guess I expected ALL the dirty secrets to be let out but they only cover most of the ones we already know about and the dirty politics that are played on employees when corporate considers them too outspoken and non cooperative. Let's face it, the workforce today is not one that wants its employees to be happy or to have fun while at work. Everything has to be political correct, watching out for everything you say that may offend others (especially with all the new cultures that have legally and illegally have inhabited the country), and God forbid if you compliment someone on the way they look! Sexual harrassment charges for sure! It's sad and the book did not meet my expectations. Save your money, don't buy it."
2,Makes all co's sound like Nazi's,"There are Gestapo types out there and this one wrote a book. When I did hiring I looked at people and circumstance not some jack-booted, impersonal ""technique"" or trickery. Sad day when corporate America stoops to these levels. Couldn't get the stink off me. Glad I work now for myself."
3,Comfortable but don't hold up,"I was very pleased when these capris arrived. They fit perfectly and were very comfortable. I used them on vacation and they were great. But now that I have used them for a couple of months, I am disappointed, as they have ""pilled"" terribly. They look old and worn, like they were very very old, but they are only 3 months old. I would be ashamed to wear them out of the house. What a pity as I really liked them."
4,Danskin Capri Pants,Just what I was looking for!!! There aren't too many stores that are carrying this style any more and it was nice to find them at Amazon. They cost less than the Danskin on line store and that made me very happy. They arrived before the due date and were the correct size - even a better guess on my part.
3,Not the same quality as the same ones I got at mall,"I had purchased a few of these at the mall and loved them so much decided to get a few more pairs. The ones from mall are soft and comfy.These supposedly are made from the exact same fabric, but they are just not as soft.At first they felt kind of scratchy. I washed them and now they are a bit softer, but not as good as the ones I got previously.They are still good to exercise and wear around the house. But don't know why these are different than the others I got."
2,wast of talent,Ken Bruen is a fine writer with a gift for creating truly nasty villians and that surely accounts for the appeal his dark vision of the nature of some humans has for readers. But this book has the look of a story he knocked over a lost weekend or two so he could pay his bar bill. It's like a rough draft of the first book of a diabolically clever series. He just doesn't seem to have the time or energy to work out the plot details that sustain even a shred of credability. Disappointing.
5,"""Men don't want lunch, they want tits""","I found this book to be hysterical. I'm not sure how much you would understand if you weren't acquainted with Irish colloquialisms, which I am, maybe you would. I just laughed out loud every few pages at the relentlessly vulgar nature of all of these characters, conscious and unconsciously, how even the 'classy' ones were still common as muck. beautiful study of hard nut people tested to their limits in the most profane way."
3,Hard Core Crime Read,"If sparse prosed, fast moving crime noir is your cup of tea then this is the book for you. Clocking in at just 250 pages doesn't leave much room for wordy exposition. Which is refreshing because they get to the heart of the matter real fast. There aren't any good guys here but there are some memorable characters and the plot just keeps twisting round and round. The most annoying thing in the book is that each chapter starts with some nonsensical quote that isn't germain to anything you're about to read. But don't let that minor bit deter you. There is style and substance here."
4,Great example of enjoyable noir,"A classic tale of a middle-age, egotistical businessman, Max, who wants to have his wife killed rather than give her half his money in a divorce. Max, ofcourse, wants to marry his young, sexy, half-Irish, half-Greek secretary. The secretary, ofcourse, has other plans, and enlists the help of her thug boyfriend. Numerous plot twists and unexpected events keep the reader entertained. All the characters are hilarious buffoons. The writing is modern and edgy, which I enjoyed. Highly recommended."
3,not really bad,Fairly quick read. There is a plot and interesting characters. After reading this book I felt dissatisfied as it fell below my expectation and did not entirely hold together.
2,Bad,"None of the characters were likeable, the story wasn't that interesting and it was really annoying how they tried to write an Irish accent. I hate when people intentionally misspell words and this book was full of them. Out of the 9 Hard Case Crime books I've read this was BY FAR the worst."
4,Wonderful Women!,"I found this to be an incredible armchair journey into the lives of hillbilly women in the 1970's. I am searching for a follow up report...what came of these women, how their lives continued to change. Thank you Kathy Kahn for your efforts!"
3,It seemed half-hearted,"I enjoy Schiller. I picked him up after spending the better part of a year there, and found it both soothing and refreshing. But Zeigeist just feels limp. It is still musically a beautiful work of art, in the way that few artists produce. But it lacks the luster of what I've come to expect from Schiller. For those who may not have much other things to listen to, I would say this is a good investment. For me, I'd as soon listen to another of Schiller's more engaging albums."
2,"Oh, please. Enough with the talking!","More half-baked reinventions of Enigma...yawn...10 years after Enigma was really big. I dunno, is that considered stylistic or just plagiaristic??AND WHAT IS WITH ALL THE YAKKING?? The guy is so busy telling me to relax and feel the music that I can't relax and feel the music.This is the second Schiller album I've listened to and I guess it's just not my cup of tea because he's now 0 for 2 in my book.If you're an electronica nut and you find Enigma just a tad on the schmaltzy side, then you WILL NOT enjoy this album."
2,"I gave it a chance, but...","I was quite disappointed by this album. I am a huge fan of techno/dance/electronic music and of Enigma, Delerium, and similar groups, so I figured I couldn't go wrong with this, based on the reviews. I was mistaken, though.I must say that the German talking IS very annoying. I didn't think I'd mind it that much, but dang! There is too much of it, and it's spaced awkwardly within the album. The music itself is not all that impressive, either. I can't put a finger on what exactly it is that annoys me about it, but it definitely does not sit right with me. I think it's pretty boring and uninspired.Maybe I just need to listen to it more."
2,Product not as pictured,"The product that I received was not the product pictured in the listing. There were no instructions included with the product, and it appears of marginal quality. I am not satisfied with my purchase and do not recommend you purchase this item from Adorama."
5,Best Book on this subject,I've purchased several books teaching the art of piano improvisation. This is absolutely the best one that I have found.
2,Historical soapie,"I had just finished reading Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies, both of which I loved and thought maybe historical fiction is a genre I shouldn't write off. Year of Wonders is set in the time of the plague in London and I was very interested to read it. I tried, I really tried but the book read very Mills and Boon and I was so bored and irritated I couldn't even finish it. This surprised me as the book came highly recommended by an old friend, an English teacher too! Maybe she had read it as a young girl, maybe it was suitable for secondary school students but I found it banal, almost like watching a BBC historical soapie on TV."
4,readable but not entirely believable,"I enjoyed this book, but wasn't entirely drawn in because I found the main character a bit too modern for the story. That said, I think Brooks is a great storyteller. If you're going to read one of her books, though, I'd go with March (which I loved)."
3,Year's Ending,This novel of a terrible time in history was fairly interesting until the closing pages. I thought it ended too abruptly with new characters introduced at the very end about whom we knew nothing.
3,"Great writing, wonderful characters - disappointing ending.","I was reluctant to read this book, even though it had been highly recommended. The Black Death just doesn't make for enjoyable reading usually. However, I was hooked just a few chapters into the book. ""Year of Wonders"" is a great title - it's about seeing everyday miracles in the face of trying times, and the book manages to be touching and serious while not making readers too miserable to continue.Unfortunately, an unforeseen ending left me feeling disappointed. If there had been some foreshadowing before the epilogue, I could have been more accepting of the plot but such was not the case.I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this book to anyone, but if someone had already checked it out of the library, I wouldn't dissuade him from reading it - it's a good way to pass the time. I would be interested in reading more from Geraldine Brooks, but I hope in her books to come, she makes the plot more connected."
5,WOW!,"I read this book on a whim.....and WOW! What a read. When I wasn't reading, I could not get the characters and the story out of my head. The story is a wonderful blend of history, fiction, and amazing, captivating characters. A great read, highly recommended!!!"
3,Year of Wonders,"The novel, Year of Wonders, takes place in a town in England which is overrun by the Bubonic Plague. The main character Anna loses her husband to a mining accident early in the story, her two children also die early in the story. During this time, Anna devotes herself to helping the villagers overcome their illness. Overall, the mood of the novel is sad and depressing. So many people are lost to the Bubonic Plague, and it is hard to imagine what Anna had to go through. I think that this book was a good read even though it was sad. It was an entertaining story with a good plot and interesting dialogue."
5,Year of Wonders - Quick review,"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. The story told is mesmerizing. So well written that you become a villager yourself, experiencing the terrible plague year of 1666. The characters and their personalities are vivid and pure to form. A must read....you won't be able to put the book down!"
5,Fantastic!,"This is one of my top 5 books of all time. Intellegnet, page turner, inspiring, and heartbreaking. It was wonderful!"
2,Does the ending seem familiar?,"This book started out strong and was readable, but the further on you go, the more oddly contemporary it becomes. But the oddest part of this book was the ending, which comes out of left field. Did any one else feel like they'd read this somewhere before? Like in a Diane Gabledon story? I wish I could put my finger on it, but by the time I got to the end, I was beginning to wonder if I'd read this book before!"
3,not that great,"I enjoy historical fiction, but this book, which starts with such promise, becomes increasingly trite, and ends absurdly. I felt as if the author had a checklist of historical facts she wanted to include, and then randomly threw those anecdotes into the novel through hastily drawn situations or characters. However, if you're not too picky and want an engaging read, this book will do. I agree with a previous reviewer that some fans of Anita Shreve will like this book."
2,"great period piece, but had too many soap opera moments","Geraldine Brooks' research into the period and the plague is flawless -- her details regarding food, medicine, dress, class, and religion are intriguing and flow seamlessly into her narrative. Furthermore, her characters are deliciously well-drawn.Nevertheless, the final quarter of the book reads like a melodramatic soap opera. For a novel centered on something as heart-wrenching as the devastation of a small town, the author doesn't need to resort to far-fetched plotting to keep the readers' hooked. Also, the narrator's sensibility is far too modern for 17th century England -- I forgave it initially, but by the end, it became too much..."
3,What a Disappointment!,"Geraldine Brooks has an amazing gift for storytelling and for writing lyrical, evocative prose about another era. Too bad she has wasted it with a cartoon ending. I agree with other readers who have remarked that the last 30 to 40 pages were so out of character with the rest of the novel that they appeared to have been written in haste by another author. For me, the ending ruined the book, and I no longer trust Geraldine Brooks enough to bother to read or recommend any of her works."
4,Year of Wonders,This was an interesting read. The book was selected by my book club and I enjoyed the first person narrative.
3,Year of Wonders-review,"The time period in which this novel takes place is not one that in general is an ""easy read."" Year of Wonders takes place during the Black Plague. The main character of this novel, Anna, goes through many struggles throughout the plot of the story. The changes she goes through throughout her life are phenomenal. The author, Geraldine Brooks describes the struggles Anna and a whole town must go through to survive during the plague. This novel expresses the struggles of a whole town and the differences they all must go through more than any other novel I have read. This novel is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the struggles of people living through the time period of the Black Plague."
3,Brain Candy,"Not profoundly enlightening, but an interesting quick read. The ending location was quite unexpected but thought provoking."
1,Don't waste your money,"I read exactly half the book and stopped. Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision. As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back! The book is silly and laughable. The premise sounded great - but the book is bad. Really bad."
4,science vs God,"This is a book of of religion, or the failure of faith.This is a book written by a person who does not believe in a God.I wanted more. I thought this book was going to be about our faith. Our faith in doing th right thing. Faith in being moral.What this book left me with, was that there is no reason to Believe in anything. What a shame. This book should not have been ""just"" about religion and/or faith. But The author chose this format to let us know that she doesn't believe in God. Again, the ""White Devil"" is totally evil.So far as history goes, I was fascinated to learn that there was really such a village that chose to ""quarantine"" itself. I looked at that village's choice and thought it's choice noble & accepting it's faith. I just wondered what I would have done, given the same choice? Was there really any choice? Were these villagers noble, or were they just fatalistic, or realistic?"
1,Do not judge a book by it's cover,"Yeah, pretty picture interesting premise; I love historical books. The problem is the author needs to go back to writing school, since this is her first book. The plague is treated as a trivial setting I do not care for Anna and she does not care for anyone, even her dying ""babes"" it is all a nonsense teen romance story about Anna and her adoration for this Mr.pompelioni whatever....no character development and was of my time and money.I would not recommend this to why worse enemy and having read it, you could pay me handsomely and I would not read it again.can I get my money back?Is there a way to give it less than 1 star? stay away from this half-baked nonsense avoid like the plague."
1,Book missing pages,"Emailed book vendor BUT NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE. Pages 1-34 were missing from Years of Wonder and vendor didn't even offer refund, replacement OR copies of missing pages. I'll order elsewhere in the future."
4,A GOOD BOOK TO READ,"this book is a nice book case baisc on what i read this story is about a girl her village boundaries to arrest the spread of the disease. but a death reaches into every houeshold,faith frays.When villagesers turn from prayers to murderous witch-hunting,anna must confornt the deth of family,the disintegration of her community,and the lure of illict love.as she struggle to survie."
1,Depressing,"I think I need to stay away from this author, because the same applies here: depressing, slow-paced, very dark. Just not my thing."
2,Too much of a bad thing,"I usually appreciate the writing of Geraldine Brooks, and I purchased Year of Wonders because I had heard it glowingly reviewed on NPR. Of course, you know it is the Plague that has attacked this town before they know it, but then you're into pages and pages of pus and purple spots, and the emptying of piss pots to the point of thinking, ""Okay, I get it. This was terrible, but when are you going to write scenes that are not just the repetitions of the relentless gore?"" I couldn't finish it. Very unlike me, to go 3/4 of the way through a book and say, ""I've had enough."""
4,Lovely Language,Well written novel. Great reference for living in this time. Would recommend this only if many others have been read.
3,Superwoman without the outfit. Nature vs nurture??????,"I enjoyed this book a great deal. Many reviewers wrote that the ending was surreal and I agree.I am esp perplexed as to how Anna became superwoman. Yes, there are people who rise to occasions, doing extraordinary things; Anna is one of those people. Anna brings to mind the nature vs nurture discussion. Just how is it that Anna was able to learn everything, even Latin, and do everything? Anna is clearly superwoman without the outfit. She wasn't nurtured into this roll. Did she inherit her astonishing abilities or is she a genetic fluke? Interesting to speculate."
3,Great book but for the ending,"This book was a fasicnating study of human behavior under the most dire of circumstances. While it was upsetting in some of its descriptions, it certainly holds the reader's interest. Until the end, that is. A surprise ending is only fair if there are foreshadowing seeds planted along the way that the reader can reflect back on. To pull an ending out of nowhere that has no relationship to the story, is indeed unfair and very frustrating. The ending is such a stretch, that I found it to be totally unbelievable. Would a minister so steeped in his faith, really react the way he did in the end? Would a servant girl really end up where she did? Still the book is a good read if you can overlook all the improbables."
2,Sexed Up Pseudo History,"Read the book because my book club had heard about it on NPR. I looked forward to reading it, and in fact it is competently written. That said, unless you are a Romance genera fan, I wouldn't recommend it. Yes there was a plague, and yes this book is loosely based on history, but it is throughly modern in presentation."
3,"Interesting, until the end.","It took me a while to read this little book. It was depressing and dark. A year filled with many, many losses and hardships. Knowing that a village really did quaranteen themselves to help their fellow man helped me enjoy much of this novel. However, the ""tie it all together happy ending"" didn't do the rest of the story justice."
4,Year of the Moving Melodrama,"This book was movingly written. The author's powers of description lead to a real sense of the people and place of the Plague Town. The tragedy she writes about is very affecting. For emotion, I would give it five stars.But heavens it is melodramatic in the extreme. People are either saintly or practically demonically evil. True to melodramatic stereotype, the evil ones runs to either the Imperious Rich Baby-Killing Aristocrat, or the Dirt-Poor Drunken Abusive Lout. For variety, sometimes saintly people turn demonic--which is certainly a shock to the reader--but it doesn't seem possible for Brooks' characters to have more than one characteristic at a time. In parts the writing is really over-the-top:... For the melodrama, I would reduce it to 3 stars.So it evens out to 4 stars - meaning you'll enjoy it very much if you don't take it too seriously. Read it on the beach."
2,Disappointed,"I had great hopes for this novel, but found it slow going and was unable to connect with the characters, the story or the language. I gave up after some 40 pages. Obscure and antique words thrown in for effect (yes, the reader knows the story is set centuries ago and the language has changed over the years, but...) slowed the narrative. I love historical fiction, am fascinated by the Plague, and the cover art was compelling. Wish the book had lived up to its promise."
5,"Exceptionally Well Researched, Plotted, and Executed","One of the best novels I've read in years. It is, in a word (and I hope not an overly trite one), spellbinding. It has all of the important i's in spades: it is interesting, it is informative, it is imaginatively plotted, it is ingeniously constructed. And, as a reader particularly fond of both mysteries and historical novels, I found it immensely enjoyable. To the author: Thank you!"
5,Wonderful!,"Haunting and beautiful! Year of Wonders is not only a tale of plague victims, but also a celebration of the simple wonders of life. I honestly can not remember being completely engrossed in a book. Thank you Geraldine Brooks for an unforgettable read."
3,Starts good -- but,"This is a book about the impact of the plague on the people in a small English village in 1666. It's beautifully written. As a parent and grandparent, I dreaded reading the inevitable parts about the deaths of children.But the novel has problems. First, and not so major, is that the principal character, Anna, is a bit too savvy for her time and place. Authors often are unable to prevent their 21st century views from creeping into the portrayal of a character born in an earlier century. I found the philosophical leanings, feminist awakening, and medical insights of this peasant woman of the 17th century too modern and uncredible.Second, and more importantly, this novel had an implausible and ridiculous ending. The author loses control of her story about page 290 and goes off into flights of fancy for the last 15 pages of the book. It's not a bad novel until then."
4,Exceptional Listening!,This is an incredible book to listen to on audiocassette! The voices of the characters are done wonderfully well. The story compelling and very much about the realities of the plague and the lives women led during it.
5,Mesmerising journey,"Year of Wonders took me on a fantastic journey into an age I didn't know much about. Geraldine Brooks uses compelling characters, vivid imagery and incredibly imaginative storytelling to reveal hope and love out of the most hideous and despairing of circumstances. I have since been googling facts about the plague as am now fascinated!"
4,I ' Historical Fiction,"I really liked this book. Historical fiction is my friend. The author did a great job at connecting me with the main character and educating me about the plague. My only dislike was the ending, which was not realistic and totally removed from the rest of the story. She could have chosen more believable ending. Otherwise, great book!"
4,Selfless acts of kindness...,"**Spoiler Alert**I had never read anything written by Geraldine Brooks, so I had no idea what to expect. I enjoyed her writings about the plague during the 1600's and its toll on a small village outside of London. The village became known as ""Plague Village"" was quarantined due to the serious outbreak of plague that killed over half of its population. The story of a young girl and the part she played in the survival of humanity when it felt there was none. Anna suffered more than most with ghosts from her past and present to haunt her sleeping hours. Anna was a great heroine of the village but few recognized her as such, as she was humble and didn't conduct the selfless acts for any reason other than the kindness towards another.Though it was a short book 255 pages it took me a while to read, I had to take it in pieces because parts are so honest and graphic."
5,Year of Wonders,"This book was written very well. Just flowed. I Did not predict the end. Loved ""Year of Wonders""."
5,A rare find,"I am an avid reader of historical fiction and have always had a facination with the plauge. It is hard to find novels on this subject. The Year of Wonders is exactly what I was looking for. A piece of history in a story I can read easily and enjoy. It is based on the true story of a small town in England during the plauge outbreak of 1666 that choose to quarteen itself so as to not spread the plauge to other towns. Although the ending was not exactly what I expected, it is a riviting story of human frailty, deep rooted ignorance, friendship and faith."
4,"Beautifully Written, But Strange Ending","This is a beautifully written book with elegant prose. The author handles the gory details of plague accurately (I assume, I've never seen plague) and tastefully. You are struck by the horror and devastation, but not totally repulsed by the gore of so much death.I have wondered how people who survive something like this (seeing almost all of their family and friends die) do so without serious pyschological damage. They don't. Even those who seem strong cannot, in the end, withstand the trauma of it all. Their grief leads to some very strange and out-of-character actions. I highly recommend that you put enough time aside to read the last 100 pages without interrruption because you will be rivitted. The ending is odd, and will shock you, but how do you end a book about events that were totally out of the ordinary for these people?"
3,17th century feminist,"This book was well written and seemingly well researched. Major characters, Anna Frith, Elinor and Michael Mompellion were well drawn. So why did I give this book just three stars?Because I, a 2lst century woman, get really peeved when I see modern ideas imposed on a woman of the 17th century. I found the ending especially disappointing and quite unbelievable."
2,Ummm....what happened to the end????????,"The mood of the novel is sad and depressing but the author does a wonderful job of creating a character that you connect with. She is human, has her own faults which she is aware of, but has an amazing amount of internal strength to accept and move on from what life has dealt her. However, this book changed halfway through and the ending was completely ridiculous. It lost that historical atmosphere to the book where you felt like you really could be reading about someone's life during 1666. By the end, I felt angry like I wasted my time since the author shortchanged her own work with a stupid ending that fits nowhere into the rest of her book. Its as though she got tired of writing her own book and just wrote anything to finish it. Don't waste your time...I hate to say that because I really did like the book until midway."
2,Renaissance soap opera with all the modern contrivances,"This is one of those rare occasions where a book's cover and blurb haunted me. I had found it in the library, and returned to get it. I read it in perhaps two sittings. It was gripping, moving, but...in the end, it fell completely apart. The heroes turn out to be monomaniacal hypocrites, I almost felt sorry for the heroine, only I could not conceive how she had succumbed to such stupidity. The rectors wife was perhaps the only person to draw from me any great sympathies. Her life is a tragedy in more ways than one, and as the wife of the rector, is perhaps more so now, though they seem a happy couple. Until she dies.The story is set during the true horrors of the plague but the web of entanglement is just a bit too contrived to be believed. I closed the book feeling cheated. In the end it felt a bit like a renaissance soap opera. I'm sure HBO could have a field day with it. All in all, a disappointing read."
4,Year of Misery,"Compelling & predictably sad story of an English village wracked by the plague. Heartbreaking to read as a mother--thank goodness I cannot relate to what some women had to go through, before the introduction of antibiotics, which we all now take for granted. Depressing tale, very well written, with a glimmer of hope & renewal at the end."
3,interesting historically but not a wow,"Read this for a book club. It has some interesting portions, fairly well written, in the end juist not satisfying."
4,"""Year of Wonders"" is Wonder-ful","""Year of Wonders"" is an incredible novel. Geraldine Brooks manages, somehow, to gracefully intertwine incredible scholarship, thoughtful philosophy, compelling characters, and an engaging plot into a unified whole. The quality of Brooks's research and of her writing style makes it difficult to conceive that this is fiction. Anna Frith is an intelligent, believable, compassionate narrator, and it is her perspective that makes the novel come to life. The effects Brooks imagines of such a catastrophe on a village are entirely believable.My only desire is that Brooks would have had a different ending to her epilogue. Yes, it is necessary that Anna should find a new direction and meaning to her life, but the path that Brooks creates for her is highly unlikely and improbable and ruins the artistic unity of the novel. Otherwise, in my perspective, the book is almost flawless."
4,Wonderful book,"Sometimes you'll read a book and it will stay with you for a long time. Other times, you'll read a book and it will give you one passage, or one scene, that keeps coming back into your mind. This book has done both for me. It will not only stick with me, but has left me with a great memory of a woman and her sons, on a day when she discovers what the miracle of her life is. It was moving beyond words.Now, for the bad...the ending did not disappoint me to the degree it did some of the other reviewers. I think maybe because someone gave it away in their review and so I was anticipating it all along (shame on you!!!!). However, it was a disjointed ending that didn't fit with the flow of the rest of the story.No matter. I enjoyed the read and have left it feeling satisfied. Isn't that what we readers desire most?"
3,Disappointing ending,"When I read the first chapter, I was not sure that I was going to enjoy the book. But then I became thoroughly involved...in fact, could not put the book down. Then came the final chapter...a true disappointment. It did not leave you hanging, but it just did not seem a part of the story. I would recommend the book.....but omit the last chapter."
5,genuine and inspirational,"It wasn't only the premise and the story that was enthrolling, but the style of writing. It really made it very personal to the reader. I started feeling with the main character. I highly recommended it."
2,Bodice Ripper,"I wonder when real book reviewers, Pulitzer Prize not withstanding, will acknowledge that Geraldine Brooks is not that good a novelist. The book purports to be a story of one town's heroic decision, but only passing mention is made of that happening. Most of the novel focuses on the protagonist's ""heroism"" (She treats plague victims and learns how to deliver babies.) and her dime-novel, bodice-ripping love affair. If we want to read about the plague, why not pick up Defoe's JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR (he knew how to write) or PEPY'S DIARY. Either is far more entertaining."
4,Years of Wonders: A Novel of the Plague,"I enjoyed reading the history of the times in relation to this disease, but would have gotten more out of it, if there had been more facts, less fiction...especially, her intimacy fiction. History is my favorite...so.o.o"
4,Year of Wonders,This novel was truly fascinating. It was hard to put down despite the the fact it was depressing at times. It was full of little twists that made me feel a variety of emotions. I loved Anna's character most of all. Brooks did a great job on this piece. However I don't recommend it for the faint of heart. It is gruesome at times. It had some unnecessary spacing and punctuation which gave it a 4 and not a 5. It should be better formatted for kindle.
5,A Real Life Fiction,"Our modern day plague AIDS is no match for The Black Plagueof the middle ages. Set in an idyllic, self sustaining village,this story illustrates the depths of the losses and thepersonal tragedies, while showing the best of the humanspirit in the main character."
2,Author should stick to non-fiction,"The author seems to try too hard to find a story in her research. There is much good historical information but her fictional story is very thin. The surprise ending was waiting to happen from page 1. Too contrived, poorly written."
2,"Kinda weird and gross, didn't like it very much.","The premise sounded interesting enough. In 1666, a small English village quarentines itself to keep the bubonic plague from spreading. I couldn't wait to start it. However, the unsetting discription of a plague boil popping (only like 20 pages into the book) kind of grossed me out. Anna, the protagonist, is a young widow. She becomes enamored not only with the minister but his young wife. I thought her relationships with them would be interesting, but they actually weren't, and I was bored by the descriptions of things that didn't seem to matter. I wanted to finish the book, so I dragged through, but i was very disapointed."
2,Uninteresting until the end,"I didn't really like this book -- I found it kind of boring. Most of the book describes the year of the plague and all the villagers that died (I'm not spoiling anything with that information). It felt like ""Groundhog Day"" -- the same set of events happened over and over with various villagers dying. I realize that each villager was a different character with different circumstances, but all the deaths just ran together at a certain point. The book just didn't have enough of an interesting storyline to draw me in. The ending was surprising and I was glad to have gotten through the book to enjoy the ending."
3,"Some good points, some less convincing ones","This is a good read overall. Moreover, all fans of Brooks should read it. However, the subtlety and craftsmanship that is seen in March is not as evident in this novel. Some aspects of characterization are rather rough and sometimes unrealistic. Yes, humans are complex. But an abrupt revelation of one of the main characters' terrible sin is less convincing than the skill Brooks shows in developing March, who is remarkably lifelike."
3,3 & 1/2 stars--can't human suffering be meaningful enough without religious attachements?,"Intriguing historical basis of the fiction with characters representing human decency, as well as insane behaviors and extreme religious practices when people are faced with a catastrophy. There are amazing and shocking stories, some gory but fantastically crazy. The protagonist raises doubts and questions about religious interpretations of courage, humanity, forgiveness, punishment and sufferings which seem rather complex and even inconsistent at times. Fundamentally challenges---why human convictions, sufferings and triumphs cannot be meaningul enough by themselves without having to be attached to religious cause and effect? In the end, she decides to follow her conviction, onto a path of independence, a true wonder of all."
4,very satisfied,Pleased with fast delivery and book was in condition as was stated. Satisfied with purchase.
4,Good bookclub read,"Although not a great book, it is well written and worthy of bookclub selection. She deveolps her characters well. The end, like many novels seems out of character with the rest of the book and a bit of a stretch."
3,The Never Ending Story,"The first 4/5ths of this story was so well written, so evocative of a by-gone period in history, so breathtakingly beautifully and miserably meaningful, and spiritual (Anna, the main character in the story, overcomes terrible tragedy and maintains her goodness throughout). I just HAD to rush and order the other works of fiction by this author. However, the author couldn't leave well enough alone and provide a simple, plausible way in which to end the story. The last part of the book is comprised of a variety of possible endings, all completely inconsistent, unbelievable, and, as in the rest of the story - melodramatic. The ending(s) left me flat."
4,An intimate look at the Black Plague,"This book is set in a small village outside of London during the time of the Black Plague. When the plague comes to the village, the vicar convinces them to stay isolated and contain it within the village. The book focuses on Anna, a young widow who is a maid for the vicar and his wife. We see the true horror of the disease and the changes that occur to the villagers as their isolation and fear infects their minds. There are graphic depictions of death, disease and the conditions found during the historical period. I enjoyed a historical perspective of the Black Plague, but found that by the end of the book, I didn't find the main character was as believable. While I appreciate a strong female character, she seemed highly improbable at times, particularly given the time period. It started off great and then fell off from there with an odd ending."
5,A Thumping Good Read,"I heard a review of this book on NPR and it BLEW me away! A totally reviting story--and imagine it's based on a true event! I was captivated by this book--its theme, its characters, its sense of drama, EVERYTHING! I would highly recommend this book to any avid reader!"
3,Good read - until the end goes off the rails!,"Just finished this book which I found to be an enjoyable read, if somewhat unbelievable and melodramatic. However, the ending was just totally out of joint with the rest of the book - it was like a soap opera where the improbable was followed by the unbelievable then by the completely ridiculous. This was totally taken over the top with the heroine moving from her Christian faith to a sort of Wicca, proto-feminist empowerment and eventually wind up with a bizarre Muslim twist. I don't want to give away anymore. A good read with some really touching portions and a sense of being in 1666, but some eye rolling and outright head shaking sections of unbelievability."
2,Great Start but Disappointing Second Half,"Although the premise of this story is intriguing and the story is written in an engrossing manner, I was very disappointed with it's ending and almost felt betrayed by its totally contrived and ridiculous second half. It's really a shame that the author appears to have lost her good judgement in plot development as she had me completely committed to the story and its sympathetic protagonist, Anna, after the first page until she lost me around half way through."
2,Doesn't end well,"I truly appreciated the view of the plague from the people and how a community might struggle after losing so many members, but the strange way this novel ended caused me to lose all respect for the story. I normally like Brooks very much, but this isn't up to snuff."
4,Good book. . . . terrible ending.,"I very much enjoyed the narrative of the heroine of this novel, probably because she thinks much like I do. The problem with this is that it is quite unrealistic for the time and place of this novel, not to mention the gender and status of the main character especially since this is supposed to be based on historical events. I was able to look past this issue (and a few other others) to enjoy the plot, sub-plots and various characters in this small village, but just couldn't in any capacity excuse the ending that seemed not only rushed but quite thoroughly ridiculous - this time not only for the time and place but even for the character herself."
3,Scary to think it was based on a true story...,"Anna lives in a village in England with her two young boys, quite peacefully. She even takes in a young tailor from England. However, when he dies mysteriously, not much is thought about it at first. Not until more and more begin falling sick, and the villagers realize what is among them- The Plague. Along with the priest's help, the villagers decide they must close themselves off from the rest of the world, in order to stop the Plague from spreading. The choices people make and the way people act when they no longer they have anywhere to turn is downright shocking, and extremely interesting too. My only problems with this book is that sometimes I felt Anna was too ""modern"" for her times, like she was telling the story in the modern day. I also did not find the ending very believable either. That said, I still think it is a book that shows you what it would have been like to be thrust into what seems like a horribly hopeless situation."
4,Semi-Historical Novel,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel after having read Caleb's Crossing and March. The writing is excellent and the vocabulary is very period- leaf fall, sennight! There is a subtle anti-Christian bias that might be masked from some readers by the religious context. Still, I was still intrigued by this satisfying read."
4,year of wonders,So far its pretty good. It would be nice if the sample ending took you to that spot in the book at the time of purchase.
4,A good read,"This is a novel worth reading, it's not a 'You've GOT to read this' book but it does give a few hours of pleasure and increases your knowledge on about the 17th Century plague. Brooks is a fine wordsmith and the narrative flows easily, pictures of what you are reading about form easily in the mind and it is a pleasure to take up where you have left off. For all that I thought some of the ideas, eg the celibacy one was rather extreme and the exotic ending far too stretched for the times."
4,A hard book to read...,"I had a fairly hard time getting through this book...not because it was technically difficult to read, but because of the subject matter. This is definately not for the weak hearted. This story follows Anna as she tries to save her fellow villagers from death by the plague. The story pulled me in, which was a very good thing since some of the details made me squeamish and not a little in awe of her will to live. This is one of those books I am very glad I read, but will probably not read again. It really brings the horrors of the time alive.The book was fanatstically written, at least up until the epilogue. I found the ending to be too jarringly sugary sweet for the overall tone of the story. Although, I must admit, after all Anna had been through, I was very happy she was able to find peace and fulfillment."
4,Year of Wonders,"Although quite depressing, the reality of those years is there and written very well. I learned alot about that era. Ending was a surprise but her perserverance is not."
3,Well-written but not contextual,"The story is well told and overall, the book is hard to put down. But I had to keep reminding myself that this was, theoretically, historical fiction. Nothing about the dialogue and few elements of the description indicate this story is in the 1600s. And I was completely dissatisfied with the story's ending. I would probably try this author again, though - just in case."
1,don't let anyone suggest it for book club...,"I deplore this book, and the only reason I finished it as it was part of my book club. So much was wrong with this book..and when you think the book couldn't get any worse along comes the ending. Historicaly inacurate, implausable and waste of valuable time, don't let anyone dare suggest it for book club, and if they do be absent that meeting, you have been warned."
2,disappointed in kindle download,"After I purchased this book on kindle - the first on my new kindle - I found out it does not have text to speech. What a disappointment - next time I purchase a book for my kindle, I'll make sure it has text to speech and if it doesn't I'll just pick up a used paperback copy."
1,3 Brooks books in a week is ...,probably too much. Brooks sure has a horrible (& probably realistic) view of humanity (& religions). I enjoyed People of the Book (despite some slow parts) but I had to stop half way through March and I flipped through to the end of this one. BOTH OF THESE LATTER BOOKS WERE SO DEPRESSING!!! Except for the last few pages of Wonders - hear lies the Hollywood ending as someone else noted.
1,A huge disappointment,"I bought this book after seeing it on a list (Amazon Listmania) recommending great historical fiction novels. I was expecting to learn about what it was like to live in the time of the plague, and how people dealt with contagious diseases while having a limited level of scientific knowledge, etc. But instead it was an unbelievable ""bodice ripper"" and I was completely, utterly disappointed."
3,Great read with too easy a finish,"After reading Nine Parts of Desire and hearing that Ms. Brooks wrote a novel, I was eager to purchase and read the hard cover.It is a good historical book, well researched by all accounts, and dramatises well the town and times. However, Ms. Brooks does not quite know what to do with her story and characters and takes too easy a road to finish the book.It's like drinking a wine with great potential, but lousy finish."
3,Stop reading before the disappointing ending,"I agree with Rebecca, whose review criticized the ending. The novel is immensely satisfying if one stops reading just before the ""surprise"" ending that unnecessarily -- and unjustifiably, in terms of character development -- complicates the story. The story sends a beautiful, fully human, fully feminist, life-affirming message which comes to a ""wonders""-filled resolution in Anna's promising new relationship, if only the story had ended before the startling ""confession"" which (I think) is unfounded throughout the rest of the book. My advice to a reader (which I wish had been given to me) is to read about Anna's return from her ride on the horse, read what happens next and then stop reading. It'll leave you feeling good about life."
3,A good novel goes bad,"I couldn't put this book down, so intent was I on discovering the ultimate plight of the heroine and her village. However, as I neared the end of the book, what began as a believable work of historical fiction abruptly transformed itself into a ...fantasy/romance novel. The characters, whom I felt were relatively well-developed up until the last few chapters, suddenly behaved in ways incongruous with their previous selves. As a reader, I felt a bit betrayed. I found myself saying ""on, come on"", you don't expect me to believe THAT"". What started out for me as a great book wound up being only mediocre."
4,"Great historical novel, weak ending","This fine piece of storytelling paints a fascinating but grim picture of life in a plague-stricken village in England in the 17th century. It offers credible characters, a wealth of historical details, and a compelling plot. I agree with other reviewers that the ending is the book's weakness. By choosing an ending that indulges her personal interest in women in the Islamic world, the author veers off into implausibility and undermines what otherwise is a tight, captivating work."
5,Can't put it down!,"It's such a sad story that I almost closed the book and stopped reading after the first 30 pages, because I was getting too depressed... But I just couldn't stop reading it. The author really knows how to keep the suspense. So I kept reading with my heart tight in my chest till the last page. It is a beautiful and inspirational book, that discusses with great depth how a tragedy can reveal the worst and the best in each individual, and how it can also transform people. Many passages appeal to motherly instincts, which touched me deep, and in general the book is full of subtleties more easily understood with a feminine approach. But by recognizing it I will have to agree with my husband's comment that ""it's a chick book"". Well, maybe it is in a sense, but it's one of a kind and I enthusiastically recommend it to all chicks of all ages."
4,A captivating read,"Details of plague, death, fear, sorrow, helplessness... all felt so alive while reading this book. The story is wonderfully written; you feel for Anna - her losses, her loves, her determination, her betrayal. I wish the book had ended differently (won't give it away) - but I felt that the strength of Anna was somehow negated by her final situation & it felt somewhat out of place compared to the rest of the story. I still say ""4 stars"" - the final scenes were too few to overshadow this beautiful story."
5,Not for mothers!!!,"This book was amazing! I would not, however, recommend it to mothers. I am a mom of two and there was about 10 pages I had to just scan because it was waaaayyyy to sad. I still can't get some of the images of the dieing baby out of my head :(. But I did finish the book and I was amazing! Thank god for the ending. It's nice to have closure in a good story."
3,Last impressions....,"This is an elegantly written novel based on a beautiful and remarkable true story. The characters are captivating and the narrative is intellectually rich.I just wish that the ending were not so badly botched. The book has so much to say that is brilliantly conveyed. It was sad to see the novel falling apart as it approached the final pages. Reading the far-fetched ""Epilogue"" almost ruined everything: my last impression is that the author a.) didn't know how to stop, and b.) wanted to make some additional socio-political point that was simply not supported by either the history or the fictional story-line."
2,"Not often that I dislike historical fiction, but......","Way too many things were unbelievable in this novel. As an equestrian for almost two decades, I laughed aloud at one of the scenes involving the horse. Also, two people amazingly mastered herbology on their own in a matter of months. Third, if anyone was truly as selfless as the title character, sainthood is in order. Finally, the ending seemed like the author had basically just ripped the last ten pages off of some bodice ripper from the 5 and 10 and added it on. (Really.. Where did it come from???)While the time period and events were of interest to me, this book was just plain silly."
3,an odd mix but 3 stars,"As many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction, however midway it turns into a romance novel. I give it 3 stars for holding my attention. A good beach read that can get you thinking (a little) about a time past."
2,Year of Wonders Review,"The book Year of Wonders did not grab my attention to the story of the Black Plague. The theme was emotional and depressing, which wasn't entertaining for me to read for a free reading book. The book expresses feelings toward death, love and working together through such a difficult time. By reading this book you feel Anna's emotions when those close to her, such as family and loved ones, die because of the Plague. The plot captures a unique and mind-twisting love story that is looked upon as rebellious during that time period, along with a society working together and fighting to stay alive. Families have to decide whether to stay in the town or move out, risking spread of the Plague. Any decisions would hurt those around you, and death was a common outcome. Read Year of Wonders to find out if the society works together to overcome the Plague or are families selfish about surviving this tragedy."
1,Why can't I buy it?,Can someone please explain why I am unable to buy the kindle version of this book from Australia?Thanks
3,Year Of Wonders Review,"Year of Wonders is a book I read for free reading in English class. I was excited to read it, but was not impressed with the story once I began. I felt like it was too sad to comprehend. All the pain and sorrow these characters went though, it was so intense, it's hard to capture it. The main character, Anna, has a life-changing event that ends in a very unexpected way. I feel that she is overwhelmed with pain from losing her family, then randomly changes her life around. This book is definitely interesting, and I would recommend it to anybody patient and emotional enough to feel the characters' pain."
4,Good book,"This was a pretty good book. It's not too long, not too preachy, and held my interest throughout. It's funny that a book with such a depressing premise(a village dealing with the Plague during the 17th century) could turn out to be an enjoyable read, but it was just that.I liked the writing, I liked the voice the author used, I liked the main character(s). I'll definitely recommend this to others, and I'll check out another of G. Brooks' novels in the near future."
5,Can't wait for more books by this author,"At first, I didn't think I was going to like this book. The first few chapters are a little slow-paced. Now I realize that the author's intentions were to show the contrast between life before the plague and life afterwards. Once the plot gets going, I found myself gasping with shock at 2am. This a very good book filled with horror, lust and surprising twists."
5,Great Story - Delivered on Time,This is a great historical novel about the plague. Well-written and captivating.Purchased an additional copy as a gift. Book arrived sooner than expected.
4,Not bad but it could have been better,"""Dear Boys"" was what I expected from the reviews I read prior to purchase but I was disappointed that overall the story line wasn't very cohesive. I was hoping for a film that had the substance of ""For Lost Soldier"" rather than one that was only a step above soft core."
2,Video Quality Very Poor,"Not at all what I expected. Subtitles made no sense to the images viewed and just generally NOT a good purchase. Very pleased with the method and timeliness of the delivery, though."
2,Foreign Strangeness,"the DVD/Film quality was terrible, really not worth the money spent! The film was a bit strange; though there were a lot of nice naked bodies to gander at, competent acting performances and a fine cinematic craftsmanship, the subtitles were at speed reading quickness and at times really didn't seem to fit the scene. All and all a cinematically competent film with a ""foreign strangeness"" about it."
4,Not So Rich or Satanic,"I bought this CD for the Soft Cell cover of Sex Dwarf, which is fantastic, but the rest of the record is just so so...I love a good swear word, of which there are plenty, but this record just seems very juvenile....but what the hell do i know?!"
2,Well...It Wasn't Boring,"I'm beginning to realize just how many LS novels I dislike. But for those I do like, they're top notch.Maggie's affair with Eric was flat out wrong. There's no way around that fact. I really didn't expect the entire book to based around it. Eric's wife Nancy wasn't much better herself in that regard, but she shouldn't have been villified for wanting a career and NOT wanting children.Once again, LS came close to turning the male hero into a wimp. Nothing wrong with a guy cooking dinner, but for some reason, the scene with Eric making the cornish hens for dinner with Nancy didn't sit well. He was too wimpy.Maggie's teenage daughter's behavior seemed typical; the girl DID have a point, didn't she? She was appalled and embarrassed the whole town knew her mother was having an affair with a married man."
3,Kindle edition - Needs spell check!!,I have this book in hard cover and love it! (The story itself gets 5 stars easily.) It's one of the few books that I can pick up every couple of years and re-read. So I decided the most efficient way was to get it on my Kindle Fire. I was stunned when I saw the number of mis-spelled words! Page after page!I'm concerned about getting other Kindle books. I expect when I pay for a published piece that it will not contain errors. Or certainly not the number of errors that Bittersweet has.
3,Good settings,"As others have said, I disliked the character of Nancy. Ithink she got overloaded with bad characteristics to make the affair(and Maggie) seem like a great option. I kind of felt sorry for Nancy, getting stuck with a guy who harped all the time about having kids and quitting her job (which provided insurance for them!) Maybe he should have discussed kids with her before marriage...instead of assuming things!Aside from that, I enjoyed the book a lot. I got it as a gift when I was about 14 (23 now), and still pick it up occasionally. I am also from near Door County and am familiar with the settings of the story.I would recommend the book as good light reading, nothing that will shake your world but pretty good . And enjoy the settings--it really is beautiful in Door County!"
4,Sweet Love Story,Enjoyed this book. It wasn't the typical love story where girl gets boy - it actually had me guessing whether the characters would end up together. The was a selection for our book club this month and I am anxious to see what others thought abut the story line.
5,great,as always she does not dissapoint in her stories. I love her books so much I just wish she did not quit writing.
5,"Beautiful Door County, Wisconsin","I have read this book numerous times because I live in Wisconsin and this book takes place in beautiful Door County in Wisconsin. I wanted the book on my Kindle, so I can read it again. A nice romantic lovestory."
4,Bitter Sweet Novel,"This was a good, predicitable novel by LaVylre Spencer. Just be prepared for alot of misspelled words throughout the novel. Otherwise, no complaints."
2,I know the setting well so I read the book . . .,"I live near Door County and have alway enjoyed my once-a-year week in the Door. Reading the book, I didn't have trouble working out in my mind just what was located where (I like to nail down these details). LaVyrle Spencer has a way of reaching the average American woman - that's why her books are so successful. But I look for characters with a little more depth. Also, Spenser's pattern of writing is very predictable. She uses lots of parallel structure - almost too much. But I still enjoyed the book - in factl the first time I read it, I couldn't put it down. I've read a few more of her books, but I just can't wax dramatically about them. I need a meatier story and Spenser doens't provide one."
2,This is comforting escapism?,"I enjoy a good romance novel as much as the next person and I don't think one need feel apologetic about reading them. I've read several of Spencer's books and have enjoyed them. However, I found this one intolerable. How can I feel the sense of escape, comfort and romance that I hope for when reading this kind of book when the major plot turns upon an extramarital affair? Like some other reviewers, I thought the portrayals of Nancy and Katy were disturbing; Nancy is depicted as such a bitter cold shrew (because she likes her job and has the self-awareness to know she wouldn't be a good parent) that she ""deserves"" to lose her husband. Katy is a selfish, rigid and unloving brat because she believes in obscure moral tenets such as ""don't sleep with married men.""The novel does feature lovely descriptions of Door Country and some engaging humorous moments. Overall, though, I can't recommend this book at all."
1,How can adultery be romantic?,"Right up front I'll say I didn't finish this book. I was so upset that Ms. Spencer could write a ""Romance"" that included and condoned adultery and turning your back on your own daughter that I could not finish the book. In the past I have read several other books by this author and enjoyed them, but next time I pick up a book by her I will research the subject before purchase."
4,Works great for phonograph,"We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this piece. My only critique of it is that I wish the top shelf was a little bit higher so that there'd be a little more room for records on the bottom to be stored vertically; they fit, but it's pretty snug."
4,Hawiian Vacation?,"(A kid's review) I liked this book overall, except for the fact that the baby-sitters wanted to tow Dawn along on that school Hawaii trip- and she was on their side. I felt terrible for Dawn's mom- all she wanted to do was spend time with her daughter and WHOOSH! back to the west coast goes Dawn, without a care in the world about how her mother feels. There's even a paragraph in the story that goes like this: A trip to Hawaii? I'd already flown clear across the country. I'd been looking foreward to a nice, relaxing New England summer. Did I really want to go back out West so soon? You bet I did!That is terribly cruel and makes Dawn sound like a snobby brat without one care about her mother's feelings. This book WILL frustrate you in parts."
2,Flimsy textural questing,"Besides for the pretty decent centerpiece, but lead-off, track there isn't much more to hang your ears around than static sound manipulations at this point in the electro pioneers career, on what seems like a glorified demo disc."
3,difficult,"its a shame that KRAFTWERK 1 was highly innovative and experimental, it sounded really electronical and interestingbut with this record they went back,despite KLINGKLANG a 20+ minutes piece of music which is very repitive the other tracks are not interestingin ATEM you can hear a guy breathingin STROM you can listen to somebody who plays e-guitar and then there is repitive musicHARMONIUM-- here you can listen somebody playing a music instrument called HARMONIUM the whole trackSPULE 4 repitive boring musicthis is their only album which is not nearly electronical"
2,Very artistic... sometimes,"This album could have been a classic, but too much of it kills itself. A ""song"" of nothing but breathing noises slowed way down is not an artistic statement, or is it wierd. It comes off like pretention. That happens too much in this album, like one long rant from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. Yet it does have its redeaming moments. Kling Klang is a real artistic piece that is almost transportational. But as a whole, it falls short. It's a visionless, dirrectionless, conceptionless disapointment. But if you are like me, a compulsionary completist, and you just have to have EVERY kraftwerk album pick it up while you have a chance."
4,Very different but very good still,Now this is very different from what they would produce later. Still it is very good and should be listened to if you are a fan. A tad expensive and hard to find...
3,Beautiful tapestry with some broken threads,"My second book by this author, a very talented storyteller who weaves deep characters with the flaws to match. Welcome to real life. For those who care, the language is troubling, even though one character actually knows Jesus is not a swear word. As is typical in a novel of today, the married people sex is boring or non existent, while, of course, the unmarrieds are full of unbridled passion. Too bad that's not real life."
3,Disappointed,My first book by this author. I did find the book very boring and easy to put down at times. I did not really like Jessie. Her actions annoyed me. I felt she was a user. The romance with Jessie and Dusty developed too quickly. I liked Dusty more before he fell for Jessie. I did cry a few times in the book and read it to the end in hopes of something. Spoiler Alert.... Some unrealistic situations - Like an aunt would get her niece a tattoo without the parents permission. Lila accepted the fact she was adopted so well. I felt there was no development in the relationship between Luz and Lila. I guess this book was just not for me. I will try another book by this author in the future and hope for better.
2,Boring and One-Dimensional,Perhaps I just don't like this author's style. I found the book very boring from the get-go although I forced myself to read the entire thing so that I could make a fair observation. I was uninterested in the characters and felt that the story jumped around and around. Not my cup of tea.
4,Hopeful romantice,"This book was loaned to me by a co-worker. I'd not read any of Wiggs's books before, so this was a good introduction. Excellent story plot, wonderful ""moral of the story"" ending. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good romance without any explicite sex scenes. A person's imagination is always better than the written word anyway!"
4,A charming read about two sisters.,"Jessie Ryder and Luz Ryder Benning are two sister that could pass as twins but couldn't be more different. Jessie has returned to Texas afte 16 years of travelling abroad leading the photo journalist lifestyle. Luz has remained in Texas marrying and raising four children; three boys that she bore herself and a daughter that Jessie gave up to her sister, Lila.When Lila was born prematurely it was never thought that she would survive. Jessie walked out of the hospital never to return once she secured her sister and brother-in-law into adopting her child. The adoption has remained a secret for the last sixteen years but Jessie is back and she wants to tell Lila the truth. Why now after 16 years of silence, why is Jessie back? Through into the mix, a hunky widowed neighbour who has taken a liking to Jessie and you have got yourself a great novel about two sisters and finding true love."
3,happy voices from a shattered nation,"this is the first recording by an aunt-niece duo from the small nation of Equatorial guinea. As such it lacks the studio polish of later releases, a result some will consider primitive and others authentic. their homeland, a onetime Spanish colony, has been wracked by dictatorship and ethnic strife through most of its existence, yet Sibeba (now going by the name hijas del Sol), with their cheerily chirpy voices, exude happiness more so than political outrage. I own everything currently available and will be so bold as to predict they are on the cusp of becoming one of the major World Music acts."
4,Italian Jungle fun!,"This one is campy, funny and cute. Luana the female Tarzan character saves the animals and is the living embodiment of the Jungle itself. In reality she is a sexy, petite asian actress who doesn't say a word. Pure camp and good for a laugh. I like anything that protects the animals and shows some boobies so this film is aiiiight with me."
2,This could have been so much more if the filmmakers had b***s (guts).,"I got this thinking it was going to be a sexy jungle epic. Well, sexy, no - the Asian star was not utilized at all except for looking on as things happened - she was definitely attractive but it seemed as though the filmmakers were afraid of her sexuality, so much so that they didn't consider using it to make the film something to remember. As it is, it is a lot of fluff without a bottom line.As for Karzan, the 2nd feature, it may actually be more enjoyable because it's low-rent enough to provoke a lot of laughter, whether intentional or unintentional. Overall, these two films are nothing worse than the usual jungle dreck that has been previously released over various decades. They just fit right in with the dreck and let the viewer down, instead of keeping him, well, up."

5,Great for weak back,My mom is in her 90's and has a weak back. This product really helps her to get in and out of the car. Very secure handle. Easily fits in glove compartment so you never forget it.
1,Don't buy this book,This book's drawings are too inconsistent. Don't buy this book expecting to learn how to draw the pictures you see on the cover. The pictures it shows you how to draw are very low grade anime pictures. If you want a good book that show's you how to draw you should get Shojo Fasion Manga Art School by Irene Flores.Shojo Fashion Manga Art School: How to Draw Cool Looks and Characters
1,Don't buy this book if you actually know how to draw !,"This book shows many pictures , but it doesn't show you how to get there.Finished hands and feet, but NO INSTRUCTION whatsoever. If you want to really know how to draw anime or comic girls, I would highly recommend buying just about ANY other book. If I could leave negative stars I would !!"
4,"Good Pictures, Good for Drawing","I will make this short and sweet. If you want to draw Manga characters, and you mostly like to draw women, then this book is perfect for you. If you are an artist/good drawer and want to learn how to draw Magna characters, this is good for you. If you are a total beginner, then I would get another book as there are not many step by step pics."
2,Very Raw USBM,"Kult Ov Azazel is one of the rawest USBM bands I've listened to in a long time. This album is intenely brutal from beginning to end. There's no atmospheric touches here, just an all-out assault that will shred your soul. After a while, the songs all sound the same. Try listening before you buy this."
5,mmmm,mmmmmmm.. finally some black metal that never dies down.. raw & untamed - the way it's meant to sound..
2,Disappointing,"This video was not what I was expecting. I was expecting more content/video footage, instead it was more like a commercial lead-in for documentary. It may have been free, but not worth the time."
4,Just what I expected.,"The book vendor was prompt in the delivery and candid in the condition of the book. No complaints in this area.The book itself was recommended to me by a respected relative who has been very successful in the business world. I found the book to be ""spot on"" with its preparation exercises for the ""one on one"" job interview. In my opinion, it is a much better book on interview preparation than any of the more recent books on that subject that have been published. This is a useful and valuable addition to my personal library."
5,Lincoln Logs,"This is a Great addition to our other Lincoln Log Sets, My son and my daughter both enjoy this set,mostly due to the log breaker that knocks out one wall so the safe can be robed!! Fun Fun Fun!!!!!"
5,First Principles is a fantastic book!,My 19-year old daughter had been wanting this book since she was about 15...finally found it for her Christmas blessings this year. She reported to me that First Principles is a MUST read (can you tell that we're avid readers in our family?!). This book is on my immediate weekend reading list.The book was in excellent condition and shipping arrived earlier than expected. Thank you so very much!
4,Rarely seen docu-drama of a woman's fight for justice,"I rented this unknown film in Blu-ray from Blockbuster because of the cast: Alfre Woodard, Charles Dutton, Tim Blake Nelson, Michael O'Keefe and Will Patton who are all excellent in this true story of an woman unjustly accused of being a drug pusher. The actress, Nicole Beharie, is excellent in her debut and the story is almost just as riveting as Clint Eastwood's ""Changeling"". I guess what keeps me from giving this a full 5 star review is that the direction is somewhat TV movish but regardless I still recommend this true story of injustice to everyone who is interested in the law of the land. The Blu-ray is excellent and the film is shown in wide-screen format (2.35)."
4,Injustice of the Justice System,"I purchased this dvd without knowing any of the back story, but the film provided a great history of the problem at hand. I enjoyed the story line although the acting wasn't the best and some of the scenes appeared to be out of order. American Violet could be useful in classrooms to portray the injustice that can happen in the realm of the legal system. This film also shows the importance of Civil Liberties organizations. Watch this film to see the heart wrenching story that unfolds and how sometimes even the justice system has to be corrected."
2,Not so MUCH....,"Hello. Personally, I am finding it very, very difficult to find a GOOD Gamelan CD. In my opinion - this was not one! I don't want a Gamelan CD with anything on it but the ambient soft purcussive tiny gongs! I don't want nasal singing. I don't want see-saw violin-like string instruments. I don't want shrilly flutes. I bought this album and played it once. I ended up giving it away. I hope the person I gave it to doesn't resent me. If you are into that ""raw, underproduced, barely engineered sound"" then you might dig it. Next time, bring your microcassette recorder to a bonfire shindig in Bali. Same sound quality."
2,Good concept spoiled by unclear printing,"This Greek Interlined New Testament has very small print & the readability problem is compounded by the worn out plates used to print the Greek text.Obviously in a Greek text intended for study by persons whose first language ISN'T koine Greek, it is very important that the type be very crisp and clear so that the various Greek letters can be easily distinguished. This goal has been achieved in other study material for students of NT Greek but not in this particular reprint.This book is cheap (& looks it) and commendably small but I couldn't recommend it to anyone since there are much better Greek interlined New Testaments out there. I own this and I DO use it but that doesn't mean I'm happy with it."
5,"In the last days of wonder, when spirits still flew...","I often think of Rennie Sparks as a roots-music Lorelai Gilmore: her mind racing from one connection to the next while the rest of us watch her points of reference fly by. She's the type of writer I aspire to be: wonderfully funny without being cloying, fanciful while grounded, and morbid in all the best ways. She's one of our most important lyricists and good fortune allowed her to be paired with Brett, who knows how to pair her words with music that sounds timeless, and who sings with the type of grave baritone that makes it all sound so important, and who can really play.I love all their albums, but this, their most recent as of this writing, is my favorite: ""Bowling Alley Bar,"" ""After We Shot the Grizzly,"" ""Tesla's Hotel Room,"" ""All the Time in Airports"" and especially ""Flapping Your Broken Wings"" being among the best of all the Sparks/Sparks songs."
1,Doesn't work in Chevrolet Tracker 2001 2.0l,"This item doesn't work in the Chevrolet Tracker 2001 4 cyl 2.0l, like Amazon advertised here, so, don't waste your time if you have that vehicle. It fits, but doesn't work, because it has a diferent operation."
3,Documentary. ok.,"Purchasers should know that this is a documentary. No concert or Music on the DVD., but OK, if you are a follower.Maroon 5 - In One Life Time"
2,A very big pig,"The gamorrean guard is a very good scupt, nicely detailed and painted. The costume is great. My only problem with it is there are few points of articulation so he's not very poseable.the arms and legs are not bendable nor are the ankles.If you can get it for a good price and are a collecting maniac like me, I say go for it."
3,Love the Movie But,"Really enjoy this movie, but it was opened want I got it. Other then this I can say anything was wrong...Sorry"
4,got book very fast,got book really quick but paid like 7.00 dollars more to get it that quick order another book with standard shipping same time got it one day later so i won't be paying exact shipping anymore. learned my lesson
4,Excelent for those starting in the business,"I recommend this book to every apprentice that walks into my kitchen. It provides a ""heads-up"" on what he/she will face in this tough career. And how to behave in a kitchen, in order to get the best results out of an opportunity."
3,Pretty Good,"It's alright, especially for the price you get it for. It does what it needs to do. I've used the vent clip attachment and that has worked well for me. I like how it adjusts so you can most electrical devices in there, other than ipods, but phones or other mp3 players too. I use it for my ipod touch and have it connected to the vent next to me which makes it easier for me to see the screen on what song is playing and to switch the songs. It also fits to whatever case or skin you may have on it. The swivel suction cup stand that shows in the picture sucks. It really doesn't stick very well. I couldn't get that work at all. So if your not crazy about the idea of attaching the mount to your vent, I suggest you not buy this. Unless you think you can make that stand stick. I gave it 3 stars for that very reason. Great price however, works fine for me."
3,Not bad I guess...........,"I used an ipod classic in my car using this product to hold it up on my windscreen. Most times it would remain very sturdy in place, but sometimes while trying to change a track or navigate through the options, the holder would just drop to the ground, leaving me to mount it in a different spot on my windscreen. That's my biggest problem with it, it just falls after a while and that could be really detrimental to your electronic device. Other than that it looks good and adjusts nicely to your device."
2,Not quite as shown/described,"I ordered this item with the intent of using it with my HTC Incredible using the vent clips. It arrived, but there are no vent clips in the package. The unit itself seems fairly decent, given the price, and has lots of adjustments which can be made, though you will have to find that out for yourself as there is no manual in the package. It will hold the Incredible just fine, and does not interfere with the power cord. The windshield mount is useless in my car though, I need the vent clips. I notified the seller and they were very kind to send out a second unit, which just arrived, and it too is lacking the vent clips. I give up..."
1,Not too slick,Not very useful. Fails to hold my phone or MP3 well. Does not clip to dash/vent well. Clips broke easily.
1,Does NOT hold an ipod nano!,Item description said this would hold an ipod nano. It falls out!! Both people that I bought this for complained of the same thing. Totally misleading description. A waste of my money.
5,Great all-around movie.,"I saw this movie many years ago, and never forgot it. When I saw it on cable, it was called sunset strip. It is much better than most movies of this type. I have been looking for it under that name for many years. I just stumbled on it while looking for the actress in perfect fit (Maria Ford). Not just another sexplotation b-movie. Movie has a good story to tell, good acting (the actor that played Sam Silver was great). Never gets boring, just waiting for the DVD."
5,Definetly worth the money to spend,"I remember staying up late and seeing this movie when I was 12 or 13 years old. This movie kind of reminds you how much the adult B-movie industry has changed over the years. It's too bad that b movies like this are not made anymore. The plot, characters, and choreography is different then what you would see today.Eventhough it is a low budget film, it does have SUBSTANCE, which some movies today are lacking."
4,Great Product / Shipping Mishap,"This product is no longer sold in the USA. So I was glad to get it through Amazon. Most of the American cocoas that I've seen are mixes which contain dairy. I lean towards veganism so this is the only type cocoa that I wanted to deal with. It took a while to get here. When it arrived the container had a bubble wrap on it, but the contaiher had been smashed and the can had a sizeable dent in it. If you bought this can in a grocery store, it would probably be reduced due to the container damage. It still seemed though that the contents inside the container had no outside exposure. So I didn't complain and just kept it. I've used the product several times. It is a high quality cocoa. I'm satisfied and will buy again when the time comes. I think the damage to the container was a one-time fluke. Accidents happen."
2,Wasn't worth the money,"Some nice new features and everything. But for a Map Pack, these maps were horribly optimized. People with the best computers get 10 FPS with everything on low on alot of the maps. Good maps and nice layouts, but horrible horrible optimization."
3,Miles too easy,"Yes I a big fan of the Rainbow 6 series, so I waited in anticipation to play this game. Well I was able to complete it in less than one day the 8 new missions, that was to have my team wiped out once or twice and then completing the level without so much as a scratch. Graphics, Sounds were fantastic, but this add on is miles to easy. Folks save your money and forget this offering."
2,Wait to order.,"Raven shield is a fun game, but it still has a lot of bugs in it. I suggest waiting until they get the bugs fixed in the origional game before buying an expantion pack for it. Also, the origional game had 15 single player and 6 multiplayer maps. The rest of the maps out there are mods so if they include new modes of play, those modes probably won't work on moded maps unless the maps are upgraded individually. So, again I suggest waiting."
2,Counter-strike still better,"I've played ravenshield and boy was it fun!! NOT!!!!!! whole bunch of bugs and almost same stroyline as the first rainbowsix and that one was SENSATIONAL, but hey, a joke is never funny the second time, I spent more than 10 hours playing the first rainbow six and eagle watch(expansion one) this game? lets not go there. but I can say that I enjoyed multiplayer a little, but! I spent 39.99+tax to buy that game and guess what I played my 3 year old counter strike more! overall I can say that this game will have better graphic than CS:CZ but if you look at the bugs and lame storyline I recommend CS:CZ"
3,Buggy with No Support,"Raven Shield is fun. Dealing with all the bugs, lies and crappy patches is not. This expansion is too expensive and promises no bug fixes. I am waiting for about two weeks after the release to buy or not. I suggest you do the same.I have played since the demo and Ubi has the worse support you could ever imagine. We had 3 months of silence from them. They then released a patch to include a wallhack. They company is terrible and they release patches that add bugs, without fixing them. Theres terrible trigger lag which they simply gave a cosmetic fix too. Sometime your gun fires 1-2 seconds after you push the trigger.Wait and See!!"
5,The best game in the series,"Raven Shield is by far the best game in the Rainbow Six series, and as we all know the expansion packs only proves to make it better.I don't understand why so many people believe there to be a large amount of bugs in the game - I've only run into two, myself, and those happened during online play. It's no more buggy than any other game. As for this other reviewer at the bottom of the page, this game IS the EXPANSION to the SEQUEL to Rogue Spear, which is Raven Shield. If you believe Rogue Spear to suck, then you obviously are appealed only by graphics. Raven Shield retains every good aspect from Rogue Spear, except maybe the fact that you can climb onto objects in Rogue Spear.Honestly, however, this game is an almost perfect sequel. Most sequels take the old game and completely distort it, with the only thing still intact being better graphics. This game has AWESOME graphics and very fun gameplay - playing online is the best."
1,"Nice glasses, but...","I doubt this is going to matter since the items went on clearance and its doubtful they'll come back into stock. But if they do, be warned:The packaging for these glasses is not suited to being shipped. A thin cardboard box, and the glasses have 1 piece of paper wrapped around them. No padding at all. (That box is then put inside another cardboard box with padding, but really, what's the point?)Needless to say, I'll enjoy my 3 new glasses and its a minor miracle that only one of them was smashed to heck (in each of the boxes I ordered there was at least 1 broken glass)"
5,Very high quality !,"I paid amazingly low price for these glasses. They are beautiful, functional and elegant.One big pleasant surprise was the volume of liquids these glasses hold; almost 12 ozs.!!"
1,Smashed to bits,"The previous poster was correct. I ordered three different Stiffel wave glasses. The first box, with the double old fashioned glasses, came today. The packing was a joke, and one glass came shattered into little bits. I've sent a complaint, and haven't heard back yet, but given that the glasses are out of stock, I doubt I will get a replacement--and sending them back for a refund would cost nearly as much as I paid for the glasses.If you need glassware, order from Crate and Barrel. I ordered two dozen wine and champagne glasses from them and not one came broken, thanks to the careful packing job done by C&B;."

5,Viva dem Morells,The Morells are an (inter)national treasure. Their timeless knack for knocking oot primo r&r is unsurpassed. Anybody whosays different deserves Ryan Adams fair and square.
4,back again,"having seen them over 60 times in one year the first time around i guess i am a big fan. this release keeps up with the fine tradition established with shake and push and the skeleton releases, good , fun slightly subverted party music. if they don't put a smile on your face and your toes a tapping, then you don't deserve them."
5,Still as good as ever!,"Lou Whitney is a rock god, and this album proves it. On this self-titled album, Whitney comes together with several other amazing musicians to put out a cream-in-your-pants mix of amazing songs. If you enjoy this CD, which I'm positive you will, check out one of Whitney's new projects, The Rugs. It can be said that Lou Whitney has the Midas Touch of producing, but for one difference: he strokes, he doesn't touch. And also, the music that undergoes the infamous Whitney Stroke turns to platinum, not gold."
2,They sure haven't been writing songs the past 19 years,"I heard a review of this on NPR that was glowing, exuberant, and basically suggested that the tragedy of the Morells disappearance after a single LP almost 20 years ago was tantamount to the burning of the library at Alexandria. Ummmm, no. Maybe tantamount to the disappearance of Joey Silverman's Bar Mitzvah boys following the performance at the Cohen affair, but not much more. This album is...ummmm...cute, unremarkable, and umimportant. The fact that it represents a return from a 19 year hiatus is even more disturbing."
5,love these shoes!,These shoes are light weight and very comfortable. Great for running and aerobic classes! Love the pink color too...get lots of compliments!
1,2 years old and it leaks,Do your research before buying a Mico faucet.This seems to be common problem. Having difficulty getting it repaired.Beware.
5,A must-read for all women!,"I'm a biology major and chemistry is not my best subject. I know that they go together, but I have a tough time with it. I read this book to go along with an assignment from my chemistry class last semester. As a woman, I really respect and admire what Curie went through to get where she's at. I think of this book daily. It was an interesting read, and it really brought my interest level with chemistry way up. Suddenly I want to know more about nuclear chemistry. And, if you knew me, you would know that this is a very new development. Anyhow, I love this book! I think it's a good and easy read. It gives a good background of nuclear chemistry. And, finally, it is a great biography of Curie-- it really details her struggles to become who she was as well as her determination to become who she became."
5,Roots music for the romantic at heart!,"This CD chronicles the life journey of one of my favorite artists-the legendary Gregory Isaacs. All of his recordings are bomb tracks for the roots rock reggae lovers; each ballad he sings is accented by his famous nasal style and poetic lyrics. As trite as it is, I can't help but listen to the famous ""Night Nurse"", a song that is from the heart of this ""Lonely Lover"". Of course my second fave ""Stranger In Town"" hits the spot too!"
2,I wish I could get my money back.,"The first mistake the book makes, is having Windows and Mac in the same book. I have never been so confused in my life. The authors should make one book for Windows and one book for Mac. Everybody would be better off in the long run!"
2,I can't believe this book was required reading for my class,I've been reading many popular Photoshop 5 books available out there and this is one of the worse. I was so confused by it. It was very mechanical and gave no helpful advice. The authors had the most dry and boring writing styles. I wish the money I put into buying this book went into buying Photoshop 5 Bible instead.
2,to basic for any previous Photoshop user,I found a quick start guide way to basic a guide for me. I've been using Photoshop since version 4.0 and found that this didn't help much I recomend the Photoshop5 Bible (IDG Books)for more help and a guide to those things that you haven't found out how to use in PS 5.0. The book was a requirement for a class I took if it wasn't for that I'd say no way... I'm still waiting for the Wow! 5 book if its as good as Wow!4 it also be a winner to look into.My .02
1,"This is NOT the ""quick and easy way"" to learn Photoshop!",Don't waste your money on this book if you're new to Photoshop. The authors provide no frame of reference as they immediately delve into the various palettes and toolbox and to other areas that will have you throwing the book down in disgust. There are better books out there for beginners but this is certainly not one of them.
2,The book was a waste of money,I cant believe either that this book was recommended for my class. It offers no insight om how to blend everthing you learn to make a quality layout. You can teach yourself the same things in the book just by tril and error. Those masterpieces in the middle dont help the beggimer out either.
2,Traumatized,"What a disappointing movie!My high hopes and excited anticipation were smashedupon the jagged rocks of mediocrity.It had potential, and given the writer and director,Dario Argento, who has written some of the greatestscreenplays and directed some of the greatest filmsever made, it ought to have been great.It is a weak and uninspired effort.What is up with the musical score?Usually a strong point in Argento's films,the music is terrible.This one is not even worthy of hard-core Argento fans,but they will check it out anyway because they have to,so if your one of those, go ahead,otherwise I recommend ""The Bird With The Crystal Plumage"",""Tenebre"", ""Inferno"", ""Sleepless"", ""Suspiria"", ""Deep Red"",""Opera"" and ""Phenomena"".If your an Asia Argento fan, check out daddy Dario's""The Stendhal Syndrome"".It is hard to believe that the same man that made thosemovies made this one except for some of his signaturetechniques."
3,"NOT DARIO ARGENTO'S GREATEST, BUT BETTER THAN MOST.","Dario pulls off another of his creepy, arty, killer around the corner, horror fare. Like almost all his movies, he offers twists on the ""seen it before"" horror movie standard. There are some neat camera shots including a great surreal beheading (all the death is by beheading, but one in particular is really strange) His daughter, Asia, is very appealing through her thick accent and alluring eyes. She's no great actress, but, come on, its a Horror movie. The male lead is forgettable, but its Argento's direction and storytelling that matters. Its not one of his best, but even at his lowest he's better than most so-called Horror movie directors."
3,Entertaining,"While not his best work of course, I enjoyed this film. I am an Asia fan and she did a good job here. It's different than his previous work of course, but it really kept my interest and was entertaining. It's worth a watch."
3,Not as bad as they say...,"This Dario Argento movie is not as bad as people say it is. But it's definately not his best film. I think the main reason is the acting. Asia Argento and Piper Laurie are pretty bad in this film. Asia's english wasn't as good as it is now and she seems to mumble her lines which can get pretty annoying at times. Piper Laurie seems to try to capture her amazing performance as the ""crazy"" mother in the classic ""Carrie"" film, but she fails. She's just so over the top and it hurts the film. But I'm glad Anchor Bay finally released the Uncut version of this film. The VHS version had a lot of the gore created by the great Tom Savini edited out. I give 3 1/2 stars for the film and 4 for this DVD release. And by the way, ""The Stendthal Syndrome"" & ""Sleepless"" aren't bad movies. I think ""Sleepless"" was his best film since ""Suspiria"" but the horrible American Pan/Scan release of this film just butchers the film!"
3,For fans of Asia Argento or piano wire,"Dario Argento movies are kinda stupid, but stupid in an interesting way. As with ""Suspiria"", the best way to approach ""Trauma"" is as a fairy tale, though here neverland is not a girls' school out of a Brothers Grimm story but rather the early 1990s. Sounds weird, but it works: the general clunkiness adds to the air of mystery. Asia Argento hasn't quite got the charisma to carry her part, but it's still interesting to see her when she was very young. (Though there's a brief gratuitous topless scene during which it's impossible to think of anything other than her father standing behind the camera.) Piper Laurie is, as always, a hoot. But who cares, right? The decapitations are the star of this movie, and they're well done. Plus the final operating room twist is impressively grotesque."
2,crunchy not chewy,"I was expecting a somewhat moist and chewy product like the dried cranberries I purchase in the grocery store to use in baking. This product is dry and crispy and not appropriate for use in baking or stuffing for poultry. It's not bad, it's just not what I was expecting and I don't know quite what to do with it."
4,sound like it SUCKING ALOT OF AIR!,sounds like it SUCKING ALOT OF AIR. 0-60 on my jeep cut down about 1 sec installing this. not that much performace.but sound good. little better mpg depend how u drive. i like floor boarding it now. sounds soo good
4,An unearthing novel,"This was the first book of the V.C. Andrews novels that I ever read. I was so hooked after the first chapter. It seems that most of her books are slow at the begining, but are electric at the end and this is no exception.-Dagan"
5,it's wonderful,Dawn was the first book by V.C. Andrews that I've read and I've been reading her books ever since. She is a great writer and Dawn is a compelling book about a girl named Dawn. I strongly suggest that you go buy it. It is most definetly worth it
5,Love this book was just like my own life!,"thought this book was similar to my life, would read it again and again. never found any book like this one, would recommend this book to friends and family.hope to see V.C.Andrews' family would write more compelling books of this sort."
3,Same formula as others,"This was the first V.C. Andrews book that I read when I was a teenager. At the time, I liked the book a lot, but after reading the other series features to V.C. Andrews, I realized that it follows the same story ideas as the others. Beautiful, thin, blond teenager is taken away from their rich family before their born or as an infant and find themselves living their early years in poverty. As a teenager something happens and suddenly their life is changes forever. Even more the same, there's almost always some for of incest occurring in the book whether by choice or not."
2,I read this one years ago ...,"... and I read it after reading the Flowers in the Attic and the Heaven series. I loved both of those series (though they could drag at times). So, of course I should love Dawn and the whole Cutler series, right? Well, I was more than halfway into the book when she was in the attic for some reason and her brother molested her and I had to pause. I had read FITA many times and the molestation/rape scene read so familiarly in Dawn. So I picked up my copy of FITA, flipped thru to the part where the same thing happened with Chris and Cathy and lo and behold IT SOUNDED THE SAME BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME FLIPPIN PARAGRAPH. Word for word.I don't remember if I bothered finishing Dawn, but I do remember finding out that V.C. Andrews wasn't the one who'd written Dawn, that she'd died after the Heaven series. Haven't bothered with any of the ghost-written books since."
2,Boring,I have read flowers in the attic and the a another seires of v.c. andrews and loved those but i was disappointed to find this seires boring and perdictable.
4,kept me reading but not all-together original,"""Dawn"" started out strong, grabbing my attention and kept me going. At times I could guess what was going to happen next but there were still a lot of surprises.What I did not like about this book were the likenesses it had to other books by V.C. Andrews. In this series there is a wicked, stern, tight-lipped grandmother, incestual relationships implied as well as made into reality. Must we repeat ""Flowers""? Surely V.C. Andrews had other ideas for plots for her books. Let's branch out! I ended up just skimming past those parts in the book.Aside from the sexual encounters, I thought this book to be a pretty good read. It kept me going with it's hints of deceit because I wanted to find out the truth as well."
4,"It was a great book, but it could be better!","The reason I think it could be better is simple--if you were in the same situation as Dawn, when her brother raped her, you would more than likely feel very insecure and embarassed about that. Dawn, on the other hand, seemed to forget about that situation until Phillip showed up in her bedroom. Otherwise, the book was great, and I couldn't put it down."
2,"Interesting, yet very messed up","Having not read V.C. Andrew's books for over four years, I decided to pick up Dawn at a used books store--for the heck of it. I wanted to see why I liked it so much during middle school. I now know why I stopped reading her books. It's soo mind warping! Although the stories are interesting, they're disgusting and fake. Dawn makes incestuous thoughts, sex at 15, and perverted touching okay...that's just messed up. I think I liked it more during middle school because of my curiosity with the opposite sex and my naiveness of great novels. Since I'm more matured, the books now appall me. I was going to give Dawn 1 star, however the plot was interesting and I've read worse. Overall, I wouldn't highly recommend the book, unless you have nothing else to read, and if you do read it be prepared to have your morals and values questioned."
1,"Dawn, the world's biggest dissapointment","Dawn was a weak and woefull tale of a vain and prissy little bimbo. I.E. ''I filled my sweater better!!'' ''Was it a crime to like my blonde hair and blue eyes?'' This vainess posessed by Dawn was beyond like. It was to the point were she was willing to cut off her stupid hair and frame it for every one in the world to see.The plot was stupid because it concentrated too much around one particular thing. One highly unrealistic and pethetic thing I might add. Other characters in the novel were far to obsessed with the leading lady (The inspirational Dawn) this included people that really shouldn't have been, as well as people that were highly unrealistic in every way.This book is very, very annoying..Short and sweet. Dawn the story of a worthless try hard and her try hard friends and family.You really stuffed up V.C. Andrews."
4,good story,"this is the ghost writer's first series by himself. An interesting tale, but not as good as the Dollanganger series, or his latest work. But still really good"
4,Great story with a twist,"As all of V.C. Andrews books reveal...there are many twists and turns along the way of life. Dawn, a girl who finds herself torn between what she once thought as truth, and what she now knows as truth, is shown that life isn't always what you believe it to be. There is a slow start to this book, which makes one sort of believe that nothing too bad will happen. However, when it comes to it, we learn there are many secrets in the Cutler family, and Dawn is just one of them. To write much more would spoil everything entirely. I would personally recommend this book to a teenage girl trying to discover who she really is. Also, I would recommend this book, and the entire series to anyone willing to get a taste of what lies and deceit are in a family."
3,"It's a pretty good book, but...","""Dawn"" is a pretty good book, but when I read ""Flowers in the attic"" afterwards, I saw a lot of similarities. The dreadful grandmother and the incestuous brother are only a few examples. Are these maybe references to V.C. Andrews' own youth? ""Dawn"" itself is a book where you can see everything happen..."
4,"This is a good book, but...","I liked this book, don't get me wrong, but there were a few cliches that continue to irk me. Ghostwriter, what the heck are you thinking; it's like you use some of the same expressions over and over and over again! (i.e. ""putaway heart"" and ""her prune mouth drew up like a drawstring purse"") I lost track of how much he used the latter. Seriously, this guy needs to get some originality...and fast. While Dawn was okay of a character, I felt she was somewhat whiny as well. I personally liked Heaven, Cathy, and Audrina better. At least they had backbones. And some of the characters were pointless. This guy needs a thesaurus and some new ideas."
3,A little better than the rest!,"As one of the first VA novels I read it was interesting to see the simularities to other books, however, it has its own discrete story behind these. The twist is believible and keeps you asking what happens next. But why are families so willing to take back children given away? Perhaps they feel guilty but the stories would hardly happen in the real world. Maybe it needs a touch of reality."
2,Kind of different...,"I was a teenager when ""Flowers in the Attic"" was first released and I loved the book so much that I would have read anything that VC Andrews wrote. However, as I've gotten older, my appeal for the VCA books has greatly lessened. Maybe it's because of the ""ghostwriter"", maybe it's my own maturity and preference for a different style of writing. The only book from this series that I had previously read was ""Darkest Hour"", and I really did like that book - however not enough to pursue the rest of the series. I ran across ""Dawn"" at a rummage sale and bought it for 25 cents. Although I did read the entire book, I still wouldn't buy the rest of the series. I guess I just can't get past how someone could lust after their own brother - whether biologically related, or just raised together. It's very wierd. If I found out today that my brother wasn't blood related to me, there's still no way I could think of him as anything but a brother."
3,"Slightly weaker, yet still palatable","DAWN(actually the whole Cutler series) was one of the weakest novels by the author, which I attribute to the ghost writer's ""settling into the original author's style"". Many events that took place in the book were exactly the same as those in HEAVEN and FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC. I would _not_ recommend DAWN to someone who has never read any of V.C. Andrews novels. However, the novel still had enough originality to keep die hard Andrews fans interested, as well as regular fans. Overall, DAWN had some disappointments, yet the book is still worth a good day's read."
3,"Just OK, Don't Expect To Be Impressed","The ""Bucket Boss Storage Bucket Seat"" works more or less as described, but it really doesn't shine in any capacity.As a seat, it fits on the 5 gallon bucket fairly snuggly and supports my not insubstantial bulk without braking, but it is very uncomfortable after just a few minutes. The open handle area prevents this from being an effective cover for the bucket if it left in the open where rain or splashed water can get into it.As a caddy, this is only really good for small parts, connectors, fasteners, and the like. Even with the removable dividers, the curved walls limit the size of the objects that can be carried. I do like that the seat does not interfere with the use of the bucket's handle, so transporting it is very easy.This does the job, nothing more, nothing less."
1,WHAT IS THIS?,"I would like to have had the information that this DVD DOES NOT PLAY ON AMERICAN DVD PLAYER. It was the first disk I had tried to play on my new player. So I couldn't figure out what was wrong, I didn't think of putting any other disk in because I just assumed it would play.Why wasn't I informed of this? I got someone to look at the player and finally found out."
3,5-Star Movie--2-Star DVD,"So, call it 3.5 stars. 'Life Is Sweet' is one of my favorite movies but this is a rather poor DVD print (struck from VHS, it seems) . Still, it's a small improvement over my cassette copy. At least now I can stop worrying about the old VCR eating the tape every time I watch it.It's a shame that a movie this great doesn't get the presentation it deserves. Hello, Criterion? Anybody home? Wake up and save this wonderful film."
5,Life is Very Very Sweet,"The acting in this film is ever so good - it makes you want to act yourself. Alison Steadman is the lead in my view - and milks every moment to fully establish her character. Ms. Steadman and Ms. Horrocks more than deserved the Oscar nominations they never received. This slice of life is truly remarkable as it deals with so many issues. For me it proves there is no such thing as a functional family, and the issue of anorexia nervosa is the most real and honest ever put on film. This is one of those rare films that move you to tears, whilst making you howl with laughter - and above all think. Everything is helped along by the beautiful music by Rachel Portman - who, with an Oscar for 'Emma' and an Oscar nomination for 'The Cider House Rules' is only just getting the accolades she deserves. If you watch 'life is Sweet' - life will be very sweet for a very long time after."
4,A must for sata laptops,"For me, and I read it in other places, TEAC seems to be to only usb floppy that continues to work when loading an Operating system on a laptop with sata hard drive. I was using a Sony usb floppy and every time I got to the second sata driver on the floppy the Sony failed to be ""seen"" by the laptop and my install would come to a screeching halt. After I purchased the TEAC I was able to complete the install thru both sata drivers on the floppy."
2,Out of Box Failure,"I tried to install this drive on two different XP machines. On both, the system recognized the drive just fine, and no problem could be found by troubleshooting, but whenever the drive spun up it would make a high-pitched squealing noise. It refused to recognize known good disks, whether blank or containing data, and asked to format. If a format was attempted, it failed to complete the format process. I returned the item and went looking for something better. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because I'm familiar with TEAC products and assume this is an isolated issue."
2,MAC OS 10.5.x Compatibility Problem; No Manufacturer Support,"Specs did not disclose that this floppy drive is not recognized by Mac OS 10.5.X. When plugged in, the drive will appear in Desktop and Finder as an ""untitled"" drive. However, it is not specifically recognized as a ""floppy drive."" The manufacturer's support department failed to respond to emailed request for assistance (driver available?) to fix the problem. Buyer beware."
5,Excellent binding,"The book arrived earlier than expected, which is a great thing.The condition of the books is excellent: the binding, the paper and the words are printed with such clarity;the quality that one would expected for any monumental text such as this.Kudos to Mises Institute for that."
3,"The Omega Man takes a ""Stand"" against the Living Dead","I watched this movie on Halloween, hoping for a scary expereince. I didn't get one; ""28 Days Later"" rates about 2 points out of 5 on the old scare-ometer. But is it a good movie? Well, sorta, but it's VERY derivative.The first third, where Jim wanders around an empty London, borrows heavily from ""The Omega Man"" -- which in turn borrowed from ""The World, The Flesh and The Devil.""The middle feels a lot like the midsection of ""The Stand"" -- complete with the drive through a dark tunnel. And the final third is like a hyped-up version of the ""Living Dead"" movies, with ""the infected"" running amok.If you haven't seen any of the movies I mention here you'll probably find ""28 Days Later"" more gripping than I did. And if you HAVE seen them, you can play ""spot the borrowed reference"" as you go along. Worth watching, but not in the same class as its predecessors."
3,no fear,"If your plan was to get that little chill down the back of your spine, pass here and find any other b rated movie. The film looks excellent no doubt and the music is also high on the list. The first two, three minutes are well done till the main actor gets involved. which makes you wonder how and why. Once involved the first ten minutes or so your thinking yeah this is going to be great! Then the let down. Just not enough scares to keep you interested. Some good actors with some big let downs makes this just a so so film with a lousy ending. The extra endings on the dvd are worth a look and one storyboard would have actually made it a much better movie in my opinion. wait till this ends up in the bargin bin and then have a look when your really really bored."
3,Give the English credit,"Films that use wildly sped up video effects and dimly lit, grainy video obviously lack the budget or imagination for special effects or stunts. I was expecting to get scared, but in the begining I felt my eyes glazing over sometimes, waiting for the real scenery to come back. It didn't have a big budget, and it was like, ""Let's get up in the morning when the streets are empty and shoot a movie about the end of the world!""After the plot began to develop, it was recognizable as ""The Omega Man"" with a twist. But it was like fresh air to see characters with distinctly recognizable personalities with depth who were reacting to traumatic situations in a believable way. The English seem to be better at developing characters on film than we Americans. If you've ever visited London or enjoy things English, you will probably enjoy this film. On the whole it was a memorable movie."
2,"Great film, cheap blu-ray, get what u pay for.","The blu-ray look exactly like it did in theaters. I bought this for $6 at Safeway (improperly tagged) or I would not have picked it up. I was filmed on SD Camcorder with no HD or way to upgrade it whatsoever. It might as well have been filmed with the same gear used in the '50s. It looks like the DVD, not better no worse. Buy the DVD unless you are an audiophile."
2,"Excellent movie, but beware, not HD.","I purchased this movie on Blu-ray assuming it would be 1080p, but I was mistaken. It is simply DVD quality. Save yourself the trouble and purchase it on DVD. I do however, love the movie content which is why I purchased it in the first place!"
3,Weird feelings about this one.,"When the movie was over, I felt I had watched a decent movie. I wasn't excited over it or anything, but I wasn't exactly let down either. It started well, got terrifically boring, got exciting again and then sort of let me down at the end, but not to a disappointment level. Hard to understand, eh?Typical or not, this is a zombie movie, regardless if they're living or dead. There are some very dry spells in this movie and, to me, it never really follows any specific story-line. Not to say it doesn't have one, but it seems to have a couple or so throughout the entire show and none of them really reach an end...sort of like the movie itself.It does, however, have some very suspenseful moments which help balance out the not-so-great moments present in about half the movie.This is one of those you rent before buying. Don't take anyone's word on it."
4,A good zombie movie,"For years I have waited for a good Zombie type movie. Ever since watching the original Romero films, I have wanted more. All of the return of the living dead movies were herendous, and resident evil was not really that good either.This film is worthy of Romero with one exception. There is not enough gore in this movie. Alot of scenes where a lot of gore could exist are cut aways. As a conisuer of violent media, this disappointed me greatly.The Characters are pretty believable. How would you act if the whole world were Zombies. The story itself is not so much a zombie story, but a story of perseverence and trust. This movie speaks on the importance of family unity over self interest.This movie is highly recommended"
5,Great Thriller/horror movie.....,"This movie was a great example of why I hate 99% of American made horror/thrillers. This movie owes a great debt to many zombie movies from the past half century but they've taken what worked the best of these from the past and improved things and boy when this gets going its nonstop action and is really scarey, well directed, quirky and very different than most [stuff] from AMERICAN DIRECTORS. Mostly plain looking, above average NOBODY actors that can actually act, I left the movie theaterfeeling I'd seen something different for a change and this was disturbing to say the least, well worth including in my horror collection."
2,A Real Disappointment...,"This movie was terrible. Ugly cinematography, bad direction, poor storyline and run of the mill FX. If you want to see something in the same vein, although much better, try 1971's ""The Omega Man"", starring Charlton Heston."
2,Stupid movie with stupid people surviving stupid fast zombies,"No. This movie was not very good. Tried to be artsy, but stunk. I would not recommend it to anyone. Ever. But if you like movies that are mediocre, than this may be okay."
1,"No fun, much less scary.................","No SPOILERS-Saw this movie back in 2002 and left very disappointed. My daughter brought it home this weekend because she knows I like Zombie movies (she didn't know that I had already seen it) and after giving it a second viewing- nope, still bad. It starts out like it's going to be really good with the atmosphere of the deserted streets but it soon just turns into one of those movies were you keep waiting for something to happen, but never does. It unfortunately was just boring and not scary at all for me and my daughter (and it didn't help this movie that we watched The Return of the Living Dead two weeks previous which was great fun-no comparison) so I certainly wouldn't recommend someone purchasing this."
2,Wasn't what I thought,"With the reviews, I thought this would be a scary movie. But it isn't. It's based on military experimentation with a virus.The acting is not too great. There really is no ""scare"" in it.A lot of people dying, zombie type undead but even they are not scary. It was a waste of my money."
1,See Omega man instead.,"""28 days later"" was a badley made movie. It contained no plot and you could never tell what was going on. Granted the Stars in the movie were fantastic. The overall movie not worth buying. It was a little too unrealistic. It is highly unlikely to even amagine a virus controlling people in a matter of 15 seconds. I personally thaught it was a terrible movie."
2,not near as good as they hype it up to be,"After seeing the previews i was really wanting to see this. I was disappointed. I dont think it is scary in the least. This entire plot has been done before. It totally ripped of an old 80's horror moive (think it was called year of the comet) where most the world is killed looking at a comet, a few people are left, they pick up a radio transmission, and follow it to its source to find out it wanst what the expected, sound familiar? Anyways, very slow movie, boring in alot of spots, not enough creatures in the film, and they arnt even the focus of the movie. Deffinitly not enough gore. This is as good as a twighlight zone flick, but not movie material."
1,Wow,"It's amazing how crappy movies are being made nowadays. This movie was SO predictable, i watched it with a friend(a zombie fan) and he thought it was awesome and bought it right away. And it sucked. This goes on the worst movies list of 2003 with Dreamcatcher, They, and feardotcom. Don't Waste your time!"
1,Horrible Horrible Film!!!!!,"I just rented this movie because I remembered reviews saying that it was really scary and I LOVE scary movies. Let me tell you, there is NOTHING scary about this movie. I think there was one part when I jumped but that was simply from shock not because I was scared. Everything about this movie was predictable and silly. I knew who would die before they did, I pretty much knew the ending before it came. When it was over, i said to myself ""I want the last hour and half of my life back."" It was pretty bad. So bad that I had to come down here and see how others were rating it. I was shocked to see the number of good reviews. Perplexing!!! Well, to each their own, but I would have to caution anyone who is thinking of getting this vid. It will be time poorly spent. Just my .02."
1,Don't waste your time and money.........,"I must say, this has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen and I absolutely love movies, especially horror films. I found it to be very slow with an all-too-familiar plot. Unless you have a couple of hours to kill and are deperate, don't bother with this movie."
1,Do not buy this movie,"I have only five words for this movie, DUMBEST ZOMBIE MOVIE EVER MADE!!!! 'Nuff said."
1,28 Days Later,"This was a horrible zombie movie, and I love zombie movies. The remake of Dawn of the Dead is much better"
2,Not entertaining enough,"ever since i caught the accent on these peoples voices i knew it would not be the best movie, but i still gave it a try. A guy wakes up from a coma, walks around london and sees that its hell on earth... in other words there are zombie like bodies walking around taking bites of other humans....sounds like another dawn of the dead, night of the living dead, zombie, house of 1000 corpses, and Scooby doo on zombie island. boring2/5"
1,I'd rather gauge my eyes out with a rusty spoon,this is the most god awful movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Boring as all get out. Nothing interesting. Dawn of the dead without the humor. its HORRIBLE.I was looking forward to this movie and I am so sorry to have to say it was probably the worst film I've ever seen in my life.
1,A Misleading Movie That Overwhelmingly Let Me Down,"As an avid movie critic,I found this movie to be dull and the least bit original. To begin with this must have been written years before the world became technological. Also if you want a good scary movie don't purchase this, it isn't at all. It has not ultimate climax, if anything the introduction is the highlight of the movie and from that point it begins to go downhill. The ""zombies"" or ""infected"" look so fake and were so poorly developed that they ended up looking like psychotic nutcases. I was attracted to this movie because it is british, and british film makers have a unique way of capturing their audience. This movie failed to do anything to me at all except make me feel like i shouldn't rented Buffy the Vampire Slayer which would have given me more thrills.If you want a movie with no climax and a bunch of talk then buy this, if you want a good movie, i would suggest looking around some more."
2,I watched until the end but I wish that I hadn't,"Starts out great then about 1/3rd of the way through the characters start to make such stupid, unrealistic decisions that I almost turned it off. Ultimately, it wasn't worth watching."
2,Disappointing and not scary,"My expectation was big and what a disappointment. This movie is kind of mix between ""Day of the Triffids"" and ""Dawn of the dead"".In my opinion, they simply copy both films to make this one so for someone like Danny Boyle, the director, I will consider his work as a real disappointment, possibly a mistake. Why to make such a movie when you know that you won't make better anyway ? Romero made a masterpiece with Zombies longtime ago and nobody never challenged his work so far.28 days later is first of all, not scary at all!!! Quickly, it becomes not very interesting and easy to imagine what will happen next. 2 stars for the scenes of the EMPTY LONDON, a real exploit in my opinion but what is the point ? This film doesn't deserve your time."
2,Worst BD Quality so far,"The movie itself is quite enjoyable; I already have seen it a couple of times before, but did not mind watching it again at all in BD (which is the only reason that convinced me to give it 2 stars instead of one).But, DO NOT watch it in BD! The regular DVD quality is much much better. Recently I've been watching new BD movies or even movies that I have already seen before in BD because I really enjoy the high resolution & high definition quality. This movie however is NOT IN HD QUALITY. This honestly without exaggeration is the worst Bluray quality I have ever watched so far.I can't believe how they would exploit people like this by just producing Bluray disc without improving the definition (which I thought was the point of BD) so that people would once again buy the title, expecting a much better quality of this amazing film."
4,A great end of the world/zombie flick...,"I saw this in the theater this summer not really knowing what to expect. The first few minutes of the movie I was thinking, "" Great, I just spent $8 to watch a cheesy low budget flick."" But as the movie continued I began to really get interested in the characters and their reactions to what was going on. The movie turned out to be one of the best films I saw this year. The biggest downside to this DVD will be the medium in which the movie was filmed. The film has a grainy quality for a ""stylish"" effect. While the grainy-ness properly sets the mood, it definitely won't be flattering to my expensive HDTV. This will be a great addition to anyone's sci-fi/horror collection."
3,"the climax and 28 days, a comment",well with it being 28 days of an airborn virus and there being rage behind it. these people are not probly doing alot of biting. it wouldnt take that long after that number of people built up.the climax would have to be the twist in the movie but telling what the twist is would ruin the movie for people who havent seen it so im keepin my mouth shut on that one..
1,Horrible resolution,"This was the most awful picture quality I have ever seen on a blu ray OR even on most DVDs. I haven't been able to tell online whether it is because of the poor quality of the cameras that were originally used, or if it was because of a wretchedly poor transfer onto blu ray. I tend to believe it's the former. If so, that's unfortunate. If it's because of the transfer, that's downright inexcusable. In any event, this is not worth buying on blu ray. Skip it."
4,Zombie genre flick updated,"This is basically the old zombie movie plot updated. The zombies are those infected by a virus let loose on the world by misguided animal rights activists. What sets this apart is that it is well made by the same team that did, ""Trainspotting"" and that it is British. Good, fast-paced, suspense film."
2,"28 Days Later, What a disappointment!!!","When I first heard about 28 Days Later, it was made out to be a zombie flick. IT IS NOT A ZOMBIE MOVIE!!! The so-called zombies are people infected with a virus known as RAGE... The ""Zombies"" run around screaming like idiots, kill their victims and run away screaming again... Most zombies eat their victims after killing them, they don't run away screaming! If you are looking for a zombie movie, this is the wrong place to start! A friend of mine seen that I was going to buy the movie and said don't do it and I wish that I listened to him!"
1,I couldn't wait for it to be over!,"I saw previews for this and thought it looked awesome. I was badly mistaken. It is slow, boring, and unscary. Less than halfway through it I was ready to leave. I kept expecting something scary to happen but it never did. Horrible film! Don't waste your time. I wouldn't have given it any stars if that was a choice."
1,bad blu-ray DO NOT BUY!,"Great movie, terrible transfer to blu-ray. I bought this when it originally came out on dvd and loved it. Picked it up when it was released on BR hoping to have a brand new experience but I was wrong. I've seen better quality video on VCR recordings left over from the early nineties. It's absolutely disgusting that the blu-ray community keeps paying high dollar for trash transfers like this. DO NOT BUY ON BLU-RAY!!"
1,Worthless film,"Man, I'm having a rough streak lately! Another bomb. You would think that the director of ""Trainspotting"" would put out another original piece of work. You'd be wrong in this case. And then the box has the nerve to say this is the scariest film since the Exorcist? Please- it was neither scary or even comparable to that true classic. Last movie made that claim was ""The Ring"", and that box lied, too. That's it,no more buying movies with the word ""Exorcist"" on it. I should know better. Boring, overlong zombie film."
1,A completely disappointing movie!!!,"I love horror and sci fi pictures and, going by the adds and hype, made the mistake of buying this on DVD before actually seeing it. I strongly recommend you rent this movie before wasting $20.00 on it. This is my opinion and judging from some of these other reviews, I either saw a completely different movie or I am too critical (which I doubt since I usually like crappy movies most others don't).The only thing I enjoyed about this horribly filmed and acted movie was when the damn thing ended. I cannot tell anyone what to think nor do I imagine my opinion matters. I just strongly advise anyone to borrow or rent it before spending good money on it! In parting here is a thought, I own over 1000+ DVDs that I have bought over the last 5 years.I feel so strongly about how terrible this movie was that this is the only movie I ever felt I needed to write something about and, the only movie I have EVER gotten rid of immediately after seeing it, HONESTLY!"
5,"Depressing, scary-outstanding thriller! Too REAL!","Here's another scary flick that is worth watching. What makes it so scary? As with The Road and 28 days Later, the scariness is in the fact that what occurs in the film can so easily happen in real life. Now, that is scary. I've seen this film three times and each time is just as scary as the first time I saw it. If you're into scary movies or thrillers, you'll probably enjoy this one."
3,"One of my top movies, but poor blu ray conversion","Like alot of reviewers said, the conversion to BluRay is horrible. It's not the movie's fault. There is only so much that can be done in a conversion. If you have the DVD stick with that as this isn't any better."
4,Great british horror,"This movie is takes an excellent take on the Zombie genre, it has it all suspense,chills, shocks, etc. If you like horror/zombie type films it has it all here. I never thought ,the guys over pond could do such a good job with a U.S. genre."
4,"Been there, done that...","I enjoyed this movie. It was fun, scary, and very morbidly depressing -- if you like grim, dark stories of the ""Gee, isn't it terrible what's happening to earth"" genre, you'll eat it up. BUT: this is a just another rip off of John Wyndham's masterpiece ""Day of the Triffids"". A few people in London are left after some disaster, they leave town, hole up in some remote estate, fight each other, etc. Same story, different monster. But this is very creepy and effective. The picture quality is deliberately ""bad"": like TV documentaries. Add it to your collection!"
2,Ok at Best,I can't believe people are actually giving this Movie 5 stars? I guess it's one of those Love it or hate it things. I liked the Storyline but after that...mostly boring. It was just interesting enough to get me through the whole thing. If you want a really entertaining Spookie movie get House of a 1000 Corpses.
1,it should have no stars!!!!!!,"dont see this movie! its a pile of rubbish!when i saw the trailer for 28 days later i thought how awesome it looked! i loved the look of the poster with the eyes! but when i watched it... what a disappointment! im 14 and i wasnt scared once. it didnt shock me. it didnt make me think 'omg civilization culd crumble'. i adored the scenes of him wandering around dead london, but when he found all those bodies in the church i was tempted to just turn off the tv... i could tell it was goning to get worse. and i was right! it just falls apart. i mean, what are the chances of someone getting a drop of blood in their eye? _dont see it. please. its just a waste of time!!!"
2,Blu-Ray???? Not this film,I don't know why but this movie does not look good on Blu-Ray at all. Could be my player (PS3) but it looks like it was upcoded badly. Would not recommend. I have six other Blu-Ray that look perfect. Don't know what happened to this one.
3,Bad ending/beginning,"This movie was alright, as it made you think about what would happen if you were stranded all alone fighting to survive.However, it did leave some open questions I really hoped they would have answered at the end. What was happening in the rest of the world? First they said the virus spread to Paris and New York, and later they said England was quarentined. I wanted to know what the rest of the world was thinking and doing. Basically, the ending sucked... totally anti-climatic.I wouldn't recommend buying it. Maybe watch it on HBO, borrow it, or maybe rent it."
1,Worst Zombie Movie Ever!!!!,It's not even about zombies. It's more about crazy people. I was really looking forward in seeing this movie...what a big let down! The best part of this movie should of been what happened in those 28 days. I recommend not even wasting your time and money on this one!
2,THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MOVIE!!![.],"THIS FILM COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT THRILLER/HORROR FILM, BUT IT WASN'T.THERE WAS A DUMB PLOT AND [BAD] ACTING.IT HAD ORIGINALITY AND THE CINEMATOGRAPHY WAS QUITE IMPRESSIVE, BUT THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS THAT I HAVE SEEN IN QUITE SOME TIME!!SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SEE SOMETHING ELSE!!"
5,This is a great movie thats sometimes scary always creepy,"Listen up folks this is a great movie its not the scariest movie ever made but their are alot of those (wow, i didnt expect that to jump out moments) What sets this movie apart from most scary movies out today is theirs no 30 year old actress playing an 18 year old running through the woods trying to convince the audience that she's scared that never works for me ,i like creepy stuff that may actually make you think I liked The Ring, The sixth sence,The Others, I like movies like that if you do to,and you enjoy something diffrent check this out you will definately keep it for your collection..Again this is actually a good movie that happens to be somewhat scary,but always creepy!"
1,resident evil........gone cheap!,i will admit the zombies were pretty good but the storyline was just horrible i was about to leave the cinema before it ended take my word for it waste of valuable Time!!!!! the only scary and horrible thing about this movie was...... the movie itself
4,better than expected,some expressed disappointment with the ending. i thought the ending was clean and good. better than having a bunch of teaser endings.Cinematography is stellar. Acting is great.
4,Entertaining movie,"Although the plot is not original this was a well made film. Good acting, good script, good directing and excellent camera work. Well worth seeing."
3,Just OK,I was a bit disappointed with this DVD. The story was slow-moving and predictable and the few special effects were disappointing. There are much better films in this genre.
4,"Great Movie and great features, poor transfer to Blu-Ray.","If you haven't seen the movie: IT'S AWESOME. SERIOUSLY, STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND GO WATCH THIS. Now, if you've already seen it, and you're looking for the Blu-Ray, this is a good buy for special features alone. You've got great commentary from Danny Boyle and tons of other features. However, this has got to be one of the worst Blu-Ray transfers I've ever seen, but it's because the movie wasn't heavily funded to begin with, so the equipment wasn't top notch at first. But really, it's basically a DVD. But for a fan, this is a great buy for features."
4,A DEADLY VIRUS IS RELEASED AND 28 DAYS LATER MOST PEOPLE ARE EITHER DEAD OR FLESH EATING ZOMBIES.,"This movie is DIRECTED by DANNY BOYLE (Slumdog Millionaire). It takes place in London where there are very few survivors after a VIRUS is unintentionally released, gone worldwide after only 28 DAYS LATER. The few uninfected find each other and attempt to stay alive and find a safe haven. And S**** HAPPENS, TOTALLY. It's a different HORROR film, But, DEFINITELY, a GOOD HORROR FILM and the acting is VERY GOOD.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE IF YOU LIKE ZOMBIE/HORROR/THRILLER movies.."
4,Enjoyable,"A horror film it's not, and Oscar-worthy it's not, but I watched it and enjoyed it and will own it. I just read over the one-star reviews, and I just don't get it - why do they keep calling the infected people zombies? And flesh-eating zombies, no less? Where did they even get the word ""zombies""? The movie only calls them ""the infected"". I think it's pretty amusing that all the people calling the movie dumb didn't even understand it... what does that make them then, exactly? :-)"
1,NOT SCARY!!,This movie was very boring and not even close to scary. The only thing scary about this movie was how bad it was. I wanted to be scared but this movie could not deliver! Please do not see it unless you feel like wasting money and time to see a really stupid movie. I could have made a better movie in 22 days!!
1,28 Days Later Blue Ray bad video quality,"Alright folks, I put the money in and have a pretty decent setup to watch this movie but I'd rather watch the DVD than the Blue Ray Version. First off I'd like to say the movie its self is great but the Conversion to Blue Ray falls flat on its face. I've got quite a large number of blue ray movies here and I swear at the time of this review this is the worst video quality blue ray I could find. It looks like someone took the DVD version and put the movie through a video filter trying to sharpen it and completely failed at it. This is a fantastic example of how not to convert a blueray. this movie was made in 2002 we had the technology to record a quality film. I'm surprised a group of people considered blue ray experts did this conversion sat down and watched the final product and decided this to be a quality picture. I want my money back, I feel kind of used. Blue Ray means they put forth their best effort to give us a great picture *puke*"
1,Do not buy the Blu-Ray version!!,Do not buy the Blu-Ray version of this movie! The film quality is so terrible you gain nothing from having the blu-ray....save your money and get the DVD of this movie
1,Another Potentially Great Movie Turns Out To Be Garbage,"Where can I begin to describe how awful this movie really is? First let me state that I am a HUGE fan of zombie movies. Day Of The Dead? Great movie! Dawn of the Dead? Great movie...both versions! This movie.... well, suffice to say that Danny Boyle apparently isn't so much as a pimple on the ass of the great George Romero, or Sam Raimi, or any other great horror director for that matter. While the initial idea of the movie is scary and the previews made it out to look terrifying, the plot is so disjointed, drawn out, chatty, and utterly stupid that any potential shown in the first ten minutes is quickly shot to hell. Did I hate this movie? Yes. Would I rather snort shards of glass than to ever watch it again? Maybe not, but it was still an utter waste of my time. I feel stupider for having seen it."
4,"I saw this! It was called ""Dawn of the Dead""!!!!",The two movies are so close in plot it's hard to believe though I really don't have a problem with it. The events were different and they both kept me in suspense. I loved them!
3,at least it was kind of scary,Although the concept for 28 Days Later was definitly influenced by about a million other horror films the presentation wasn't half bad. The movie starts off well giving you a false hope of a jam packed thriller of a flick but it slows down to just a trickle of very little action until the climax. The actors do a decent job and the movie is actually kind of funny at some times (though mostly unintentional) All in all you can't expect too much of it except to be another horror flick. Definitly not Danny's best but it's good for a scare. P.S. Be sure to check out ALL of the alternate endings.
2,Eh?,"Well, I thought the movie had a great and original storyline but I was not to fond with the acting and filming. In all honesty, the only good thing about this DVD is the movie's storyline and that is it, I just can't say more. You may want to give it a look.. but don't expect much."
1,this movie stinks,"I agree that the premise was great, and there were really good visual effects (e.g., the empty English cities), but I was expecting a movie that was going to SCARE me (that WAS the claim, remember?), or, at the least, be chock full of zombies and gore. On both of these it failed. This is the reason I think the movie stunk like rotting cheese you forgot at the bottom right corner of your refrigerator from seven months back.Bottom line: if you are into ""artsy-fartsy"" type zombie movies then definitely see this movie. If you want to be scared and see tons of zombies and gore, go with one of your favorite classics, DO NOT pay to see this tripe."
1,AWFUL MOVIE,"This is the first review i write here, and i thought i must warn you buyers not to even rent this movie, it is the most boring movie ever!!it doesen't have any suspense or intelligent plot.Don't buy it please...."
1,Not at all as described,"Based on a lot of great reviews, we rented this movie thinking we were in for a good old fashioned horror movie. Not! It was a very boring movie, and actually quite silly. Not worth the time."
1,HORRIBLE!!!! BLU-RAY LOOKS LIKE A analog RECORDING IN THE 60'S,"This is awful. the bluray version no way near matches my other collection..At first , i thought it was the blu ray player or the tv but those components are perfect. i am thinking the BD is defective, maybe i shall return it and get another one. DONT BUY THE BD VERSION...Luckily i purchased it for 10.00..i think its worth only 5.00."
2,Du faux zombie,"Je vien de terminer ce supposer film de Zombie hyperactif. Moi jai pas super acrocher comme pour la plupart d'entre vous ,l'idé de départ me semblais bien mais pas tres original quand on compare a Romero. Le film semble nous mener nul part , discourt inutil par si par ,la music est foutrement mauvaise ce qui tourne le film quasi ridicule et quand au effets gore aucune ne sont réussi , ca ce passe trop vite on a pas le temp de rien voir. Quelques idées on été emprunter a Romero , je dirait meme copier comme quand on peut voir la scene du pillage dans l'épicerie. qui me fait rappeller une scene culte de Dawn of the dead dans le Mall. je m'attendais a voir du Zombie ce fesant flinguer ce qui est tres rar . On peut voir une fin alternative ou Jim meurt apres l'operation. Apart ca rien de bon dans ce film , À conseiller au fan de film récent peut-etre , rien a voir avec les bon vieux classic de Zombie, Préféré le remake de Dawn of the dead pour du cinema récent."
1,DONT BUY THIS-rent it if you must !,"My 11 year old son kept bugging me to see this movie. I belong to netflix, so told him it was in the line up. He just couldn't wait. Now, as a mom, I find it hard to keep up on ALL the movies ""big boys"" think they want to see. I am usually good at weeding them out. So, I figured, ""well, if he doesn't like it, me & my husband might"" NOT !! WRONG !! This was not only visually & emotionally disturbing, but looked like high school drama majors filmed it. Most of the time, movies dont show acts of violence aimed at children, being loaded with zombie viruses or not ! I wont give it away, some people go for this,but the opening scences were so dang creepy- I was like ""Only the British could show that & not be offended """
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!!,"OKAY, IF I COULD I'D GIVE THIS MOVIE 0 STARS! THIS MOVIE SUCKED, AND I HATED IT! The storyline was stupid, and the actors sucked. The movie was BORING with a capital B. Nothing made sense, and it was stupid."
2,Plot disregards what it means to be a human,"I really enjoyed this film and recommend it. However, the plot has one major, glaring flaw which pretty much flies in the face of what it means to be human.I can't believe the women didn't go along with the soldiers' plan. They would have been protected, fed, sheltered and guaranteed to have offspring. If they had just a bit of smarts they could have spun that situation so that they enjoyed a somewhat powerful, comfortable position in a world gone to hell. Instead they chose to face the continued, exhausting threat of being eaten by pseudo-zombies.In general, people will do anything to survive and Selena says as much early on. Even if it means having servicing someone they don't particularly like. Carnal, unromantic, and harsh but a biological reality none the less. We wouldn't be here now if it weren't.Other than this annoyance it is beautifully shot, the soundtrack suits it well and it is a fun watch."
2,Confusing,"The movie begins in an animal testing lab where a group of animal rights activists attempt to free the monkeys that are imprisoned there. Just as they are about to release one, they are caught by a scientist who tells them that the monkeys have been infected with something called 'rage'. The activists scoff at the scientist and set on monkey free. The minute that happens, the monkey immediately attacks a woman, infecting her with rage.Fast forward 28 days, and a man (Jim) wakes up in a hospital only to find himself completely alone. He leaves the hospital and sees that the streets are deserted as well. After a frantic search, he meets to survivors. Occasionally, they come across one of the undead and must kill them or else they stand to become infected themselves.This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The storyline was really slow and confusing. I'm just thankful that I rented it and didn't shell out money to see it in the theatre."
1,What is this crud!,"This movie wasn't scary at all! I was so bored. Nobody I saw it with found it scary in any way either, so skip this load of crud. It is senseless gore and violence that doesn't scare, disturb, or gross out people. Big waste of time and money."
1,Most aweful,"This movie was so pathetic I left the theatre after half the movie. It's about monkey's infected with ""rage"" by watching violence on television. Are we going to see a violent barney movie next??"
1,Don't get me started!!,"Bro, seriously, how can anyone give this movie higher than one star? The only reason it got one star from me is that i can't give it negative 2 stars. I wont bore you with details like this movie bored me but i will say just save your money. Don't even rent this, if you really want to see it try to download it you will be glad you saved your money. To this very day this is still the absolutely worst movie i have ever seen in my life, not just horror movie the worst movie period."
1,Harmful,"As I said in the title Harmful. Not very stimulating, fun and if you were expecting to hide behind the sofa just through that idea out of the window. Basically one man wakes up from hospital 'unharmed' after a bomb has wiped out the everyone in England. Or so it seems. A few survivors are there to help but the rest are all mutants trying to eat their skin and so on.No plot.No stars.No good scenes.No sense.Don't waste good money. Try 'The Shining'."
1,HORRIBLE.... don't buy this movie,Put it into kinder words. 28 Days Later makes the Blair Witch Project worthy of an oscar. Don't even bother
2,Worst BD quality ever?,"There is absolutely no reason to get this on Blu-Ray, in fact I found it looks at least as good in standard def. Over all I enjoyed the movie, but it really looks bad, almost like it was shot with an old consumer video camera. So much so, that it had me messing around with the settings on my player and TV, and I even put another disc in to make sure it wasn't something I did. For reference, I also have 28 Weeks Later and its worlds better in visual quality, it actually looks high def. Unfortunately that can't be said for this movie (but for the last few minutes). I almost started to wonder at one point if it was done that way on purpose for artistic reasons... then the contrast of the clarity at the end to show that things are improving in the world?? Anyway SD is fine for this one... and would have got a 4 stars rating."
1,Another bad horror movie,"I just spent the first 15 minutes to know thw movie was stupid, boring and with the worst plot ever planned. Has a good beginning, but goes down until the end. It's the mix of the movies of George A. Romero and Resident Evil, but in England. The dialogues are made by a child, the characters are annoying, the music is disturbing and the movement of the camera, seem to made a man with Parkinson. Don't waste your time and money with this."
1,What a pile of crap,The title of this review pretty much sums it up...but lets not stop there. Never before have I seen a film where at the end of it I was actually ANGRY that I had sat through this uninspired pile of fesces. No joke... I hope that the director of this movie gets dragged away by wolves or savagly murdered in front of all the horror fans in the world. Quite possibly the worst movie ever.... EVER!!! i would rather sit down with every movie that Whoopi Goldberg has ever starred in and watch them in a 48 hour marathon than subject my poor eyes to this trivial garbage again. shame shame.
2,"heh, resident evil was much better belive it or not.","28 days is more of a psychological mish-mash of a suspense as oppossed to real horror,the so called zombies are nothing more than red eyed crazies, who barf and beat up their victims. (""ooh scary, yeah right) days borrows heavly off of stephen king's the stand,the omega man and even a scene from escape from ny where a cab crases over a pile of cars.the alternate endings and some deleted scenes were much scarier,especially the radical ending. how cool was that?compared to night of the living dead,lucio fulci's spaghetti thriller; ZOMBIE or even sony's resident evil flick which had scarier zombies 28 days fails to impress."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"It was the worst movle that I have ever seen. The movle never went anywere, Just the movle veiwers leaving the theater place have through."
1,Weak and Irritating,"As a fan of any kind of movie that is loosely similiar to Zombies I had high hopes for this movie.No such luck.Despite the obvious homage to Omega Man and George Romero, this falls horribly short.From characters you do not care about, to plot holes to the choppy erratic cinematography that is in vogue now as a way to try and introduce tension, this movie fails on all counts.Can't understand what people find intriguing with this dissapointing use of celluloid.Save you money and watch Romero's classics or even Omega Man."
2,Senseless and Pointless,"In the beginning of the film, the audience finds out that the infection in the laboratory monkeys is caused by rage. This leads the audience to believe that the movie will convey rage and its effects on human beings, thus making people compare the movie's reality to that of their own. (Basically, people will be forced to look at their own lives and see how they need to change in order to make this world a better place. You would think this is another one of those ""wake up and smell the coffee movies"" that would try to get people to change their destructive behavoior.) This movie does NOT deliver this message however. Even if it tried to, the movie was just too violent and gruesome. Realities of the world can be shown in a smart, non-violent manner as well.28 Days Later delivers no strong message(s) to the audience and is just another waste of film and money."
1,...,"This is not a zombie movie for those of you that think it is. It is about a monkey infected with rage being set free by some green peace type activists. First of all, if there is nudity in a movie it should not be a man! Through out this entire movie people ran from infected people who can now run faster than a speeding train, and leap small buildings in a single bound. The killings where awefull! It was that type of stobe light type death. I actually walked out of this movie. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. THIS IS NOT A ZOMBIE MOVIE! subtract one star from my rating."
1,Lame and awful,"It started out pretty good, but quickly went downhill. By the time it ended, this movie truly sucked. Do not waste your time on this. If you rent it I'll guarantee you'll shut it off half way through. If you buy it, you'll sit and suffer as you watch the whole thing through. I mean you bought it so you HAVE to watch it right? The story sucked, the soldiers sucked, and the ending REALLY sucked.Check out the special features. The alternative ending is a hoot. It's not an alternative ending, it's an alternative movie. They had no idea where the hell they were going with this. Just a bad bad bad movie. Terrible in every way."
3,If Bioterror ever happens,"The Trainspotting team with Danny Boyle have made another good movie. This time about what will happen to England if there is an outbreak of a very deadly virus. It could be a scenario though up by people who know a lot about bioterror although it seems to be unlikely something like this will happen. It's fact and fiction, like a horror story. The virus is passed through by blood, no strange things there, but they almost turn into zombies, and that seems unlikely.Someone wakes up in a deserted hospital, not knowing what happened. He finds a few people and they try to get to the neighborhood of Manchester where still some normal people are. They are not so normal after all and things turn bad.I haven't seen all the alternate endings and would really like to. The 'normal' version ends a little too happy."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"28 Days Later was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am a horror movie fanatic; 28 Days Later was disappointing. It didn't even make much sense. Truthfully, it is not even worthy of being rated 1 star. I tried to make the best out of the movie though. At first it will put you to sleep, but it got a little interesting throughout, but overall, it is a horrible movie. The ending is terrible. It's not even really a ""horror movie."" There is no action in the movie whatsoever. I can't honestly say one good thing about this movie. This movie was a BIG MISTAKE."
1,Bad remake of a bad movie...,"This is simply a nonsensical and unneeded remake of ""Day of the Triffids"" with zombie humans replacing alien plants. What else is there to say but: If you start off with a bad movie and remake it into an even worse one, how good can it possibly be? At least ""Day of the Triffids"" can fall back on it's release date (1962) as an excuse for it's quality."
1,Most Overhyped Film of 2003,"As a zombie fan, I was very excited about a supposedly classy zombie film fresh out of the UK. Major letdown--even 'Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things' had a better script. I would have fallen asleep if I weren't so annoyed with how despicably Romero was ripped off. There are a handful of great zombie movies; there are legions of entertaining zombie B movies; and there are a handful of miserable zombie movies. '28 Days Later' is, sadly, in the final category."
1,scary as hell?! BORING AS HELL!,"i am a huge fan of horror movies so when i heard this movie was the scariest thing since the exorcist, i checked it out right away.oh my god, don't believe it. i actually laughed when that kids dad got infected.not worth a moment of your time."
1,Scary? No way! / Boring? Definately!,"Wow, was this movie a disappointment! On the DVD box it is suggested that this is a ""terrifying film."" Try boring and un-scary instead. It is ""terrifyingly bad"" and shouldn't even be considered a ""horror"" film at all."
1,So crap it&#65533;s unbelievable,"28 days later I still feel the same. This has got to be the most over rated movie of all time. Before watching this turkey every critic and every review was boosting this crap. Saying how original the movie is, how terrifying it is and how great the directing is, boy have they changed since. Where was the originality? Where's the terror? What Directing? There's hardly no action, no blood and theirs nothing in it that could scare a six year old. Don't believe the hype, if you want to watch some thing scary try the Ring, Exorcist, anything but this. I have never been so bored in my like, however, on the good side, if you have trouble sleeping then definitely rent this."
5,Good Movie,Bought this along with 28 Weeks Later. A must have for Zombie movie lovers. The Blu-ray disk plays perfect with clear picture.
3,"Good, but could have been better","This movie was good. It had a very deep rooted lesson on humanity and how we are destroying each other everyday. But I think the movie could have been made better. For starters, we hardly ever saw the ""infected"" zombies. When we did see them, the camera angles were so fast that it was hard to get a real good look at them. And what was with the computer generated flowers, (if you have not seen the movie, you'll know what Im talking about when you do.)And certain things just dont add up. (Spoilers below)For starters, When Jim was shot at the end and their car crashed through the gate, the next shot we see is the hero characters in a cabin in the country. How did they get there? And when Jim wakes up in the hospital in the beginning, with the hospital in shambles and no one around, how is it that he was untouched by the infected? Anyway, the movie was enjoyable to watch, but those who are comparing it with the greatness of Romero's films....it ain't true!"
2,Awful!!,Just another Dawn of the Dead copyier. Was awful don't waist your money. Watch Resident Evil instead!!!!
2,It Sucked,Wasnt the worst ive ever seen but it was bad. It wasnt a horribly bad movie. The begining of the film looked promising and original and kept your interest for the first hour or hour and a half but the end sucked. Started getting repetitive and boring in the last hour. Had promise but disapointed. Id definetly recomend this over the zombie movie Resident evil which was about 1 and a half stars. This is a 2.5 or 3 stars. It had cool looking zombies and an interesting plot but overall fell short and disapointed. Also on the back cover it says ( scarier than the exorcist) - THATS a JOKE. It got old after awhile and Its nowhere near as scary as the classic horror movies. Its sci fi. Another comment on the back says ( it will haunt you for days) - ANOTHER JOKE. Id recomend this to you if you like sci fi or zombies just to see it but I wouldnt recomend it to you if you are not into that.
2,Disappointed,"This movie was hyped a lot, but by the time I saw it, I just didn't feel it was very scary or shocking.I really liked the scene that the Ave Maria was playing over 'cause that's good music, but the move never really takes off.There's a bit where a bunch of CGI rats come running through and I'm thinking, cor! It's finally beginning. But no, not really.If you look at some classic zombie films, like Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead, there are zombies who stand out. A hare Christina, Bub, the clown. And topping the bland zombies is an even blander cast of humans.Even the worst Italian low budget zombie films, like Zombie 3 & 4 are more entertaining.This is, like, art, or something and so isn't allowed to be entertaining."
5,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"SUCH A GREAT ADRENALINE RUSH THIS MOVIE WAS OUTSTANDING AND A BLAST MY HEART WAS POUNDING AND I LOVED IT,,, GET THIS ONE WORTH A RENT PURCHASE JUST A GREAT ZOMBIE PICTURE THATS SUPER ENTERTAINING!!!!"
5,Disturbing,"That's the word for this film - it is far more scary if you live in the UK & have walked down the same streets as featured in the film! Majority of poor reviews on this are posted by guys from the US - imagine if it was your city...The idea here isn't to make a Zombie film, it is to examin the darker side of human nature & the desire for survival at any cost. It also addresses genuine (& realistic) fears in the modern world about a pandemic wiping out the world's population following 9/11. The manifestation of the disease as a zombie-creating evil is inconsequential & shouldn't be looked on as the most important aspect of the film. There are too many themes to go into here.The start of the film is breathtaking & creeped me out for weeks, the shots of deserted London streets & the M6 motorway completely deserted are genuinely disturbing. The fact that this film is set in the UK as opposed to the US makes it even more freaky.Like I say - much better if you are British! Awesome."
4,Well...,"Really good movie. The acting by the entire cast is phenomenal. The cinematography (digital) is some of the best I have ever seen. The script is strong dialogue wise although it completely ripped off scenes from other movies (i.e. dawn of the dead and day of the dead). What made the film for me though no matter what bad things I could say about it is the three central characters are so likeable, we care about them so much that movie works...Easily. This is one of those films where the cast really carries it all the way through. Boyle really lucked out in that respect. There are indeed a few suspenseful scares though regardless of what the other reviewers might say...And I have seen quite a few scary movies. Not sure how I feel about the ending yet but overall this is a highly entertaining film worth a rental."
4,"Well made ""smart"" horror movie","This movie is NOT what I (and probably most people) expected. Its not some action packed slasher movie with a cool soundtrack. Its a relatively slow paced ""atmospheric"" movie that promotes you to think ""What would I do in that situation"" There are some VERY slow parts in this film, some extremely quiet parts (so quiet you can hear people eating popcorn and such), but it adds to the ambience of supposedly bieng ""the last person on earth"". I wouldnt call the people ""zombies"" but they are something else all together. I only saw 2 somewhat major plot holes, but otherwise very well made and kinda artsy fartsy. Not recommended for the ADD adlolescents out there but more for the patient thinking types. Other than the 2 plot holes it would get 5 stars from me."
5,Not a horror fil at all,I liked the film direction. It showed the worst in human behavior and the best. Cillian is brilliant as Jim. The main characters grow so much during the film and that makes it a beautiful film.
2,Not what I expected...,"The movie is not what I expected...and that's a bad thing. I mean, the movie was good for awhile and keeps me at the edge of my seat. (Which by the way, the movie is about a man that survives not having a virus in him that makes him evil and scary with red eyes, who's trying to get the heck out of there. It's like ""Resident Evil"".) But in the end, that's what I don't get and makes me mad that I waste my uncle(s) or auntie(s) money! Sorry! :( So, don't watch it!"
4,Creepy Movie.,"I really enjoyed this movie until the very end (which is why I didn't rate it five stars.)But if you like ""night of the living dead"" type films this will be worth the purchase price. Be sure to check out the more realistic ending."
4,A Nearly Perfect Horror Flick,"First of all, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you should go and rent it now. This is one of the best horror films ever made.This film is not just a horror movie, its also a beautiful piece of art. The cinematogrpahy is wonderful and even the frequent splashes of blood are artistic.The acting is superb with Cillian Murphy as the hot leading man and Naomi Harris as his partner. The story takes an even more serious turn when the main characters discover that the rage-infected zombies are not the worst monsters.This is really a great movie. You won't be disappointed. 28 Days Later shows that the British really are the masters of horror movie-making."
5,Great movie.,"Yet another one of the few movies that I consider worthy of re-watching. Though this is my favourite genre (hell, I even liked Waterworld), this movie was very well done. It's extremely dark and forboding. The atmosphere is incredibly good. Sure, it's not entirely realistic (I can't think of a virus that would hit you in 10 seconds and turn you freaky so fast), but details like that aside I consider this to be a pretty accurate depiction of how a catastrophe like this could hit the world.Certain scenes are, of course, very memorable. Two in particular would be: 1) When what's-his-face wakes up and wanders around London, and nobody is around and 2) When what's-his-face et al. find a man and his daughter holed up, waiting everything out.Movies like this make one think ""Damn, that could be me one day."" Will it be you? Almost certainly not, but this is fiction with a real possibility to it, and that's what makes it so visceral and real."
4,"Good, Just Don't Call It A Zombie Movie","28 Days Later is of the love it or leave it variety. The problem I think a lot of horror movie fans had with the film is that it was marketed as a zombie film when it really isn't. The zombies are the backdrop for a film that questions the meaning of survival. However, the film tries to hit you over the head with this, particularly towards the end. The last half of the movie is a little slow compared to the start of the film but it has its moments. The ""reinvention of the zombie genre"" as the critics called it is pretty much making the zombies faster (which I think is cool but I won't argue about it). All in all, if you want to see a film that raises questions on the meaning of survival and rage, give this a try. If you want to see a two hour movie with nothing but zombies getting their heads blown off, see the new Dawn of the Dead (which by the way only has running zombies in common with 28 Days Later, despite what people say)."
2,Not exactly your typical horror movie,"I rented 28 days later based on coworkers hype about thismovie. I was a bit disappointed that the movie was solow budget looking. Also, the movie lacked a lot of thehumor that I expect in these kind of movies. I guess themovie was suppossed to shock more than entertain, butthat's not why I go to the movies."
2,"""SLEEPING BOOOOOOBY""","WELL! It is a bit like Woody Allen's ""Sleeper"" - waking up from a coma to find that things 'have changed - somewhat' ~ then of course Vinnie the P's Version ""The Last Man On Earth"" in glorious black and white shot in the deserted Olympic Italian village circa 1961 is it? That's the bleakest - not forgetting Charlton Heston's odd remake...This one's somewhat predictable - and somewhat yes - enjoyable as our rainbow troupe of survivors plod their way to salvation acress merry olde england.Chilling too since labs are open prey today and lord knows what 'walks amongst us' these days.More of the plague stricken would have been fun along the lines of ""Living dead of the Manchester Morgue"" - but not too happy with the way Anglo-Africans are seemingly exploited in this flick .... unpleasant.The male nudity ?Not quite necessary ......footnote ~ anti-radiation pills are currently available [no kiddin'] should one invest???"
1,"Horrible, not Horror!","What an incredible waste of time, I can't believe that I sat and watched the whole thing. If I could give it a negative rating I would. The real shame about this movie is that the premise is possible, making it potentially horrifying. Unfortunately, the most horrifying thing about this movie was the acting.The characters were poorly developed and the character interaction was so completely ridiculous that it made the movie unbelievable. The dialog was idiotic and so poorly delivered that I started hoping that the protagonists would be kiled, just so that they would shut up. I was really hoping that Cillian Murphy would be eaten alive, or at least knocked unconcious."
1,Just Bad,"Having recently viewed this movie, I can honestly say this is a must miss for all horror fans. First the good, the sound track was really well placed and worked great, if you are a gore fan, there was plenty of it, and I really liked that they did not try to just keep things jumping out at you, they won't more for a pyschological thriller. However, they failed on the pyschological thrill. The movie was just walking and more walking, the few short action sequences where good (but there was only about 3 of them). Honestly you just walk out of the theatre rather bored and feeling like you've been it for 28 days, it fails to have any impact and comes off as rather comical."
3,Wrong turn,"This movie started slow, but then truly grabbed a hold of me. As a huge fan of apocalyptic movies (""Dawn of the Dead"" & ""The Thing"" being my favorites), it was a fresh turn to really get to know the characters. The Director actually succeeded in getting me to care about them. Caring males and beautiful yet very strong females, all becoming friends - more like family. Then an inevitable point in the movie came - things have settled a bit, what do we do now?The characters go to a military base - which turns out to be a blockade to any further creativity in the film. Soon follows a plot twist so intolerably dispicable, it ruins the movie and leaves a sour aftertaste. How any man could actually write that into a story, I have no idea. Yes it is possible, but it is revolting and not something I want to see, much less pay to see."
1,Cheap Sci-Fi/Horror,"A very tacky, politically correct, horror sci/film that has nothing going for it except for a generic screenplay, bad acting, and very cheap special effects.The story starts with Jim (Cillian Murphy) waking up in deserted hospital in the middle of London. He soon realizes that the entire city is deserted and the film goes back in time to tell us how it got that way. It so happens that humans have been infected by a rage virus which takes 28 days to incubate. The virus was in experimental chimps who were freed by overzealous animal activists. The film then becomes a cat-and-mouse thriller between normal humans and infected humans.A very bland film with politically correct undertones about the value of liberal activists and the dangers of the military establishment. A very contrived film with a cheap plot, lousy acting, and lousier still special effects. Avoid at all costs!"
1,Euro Road Trip in Peril,"Yikes, another Euro Road trip through empty city-scapes, pursued by red-eyed zombies, with lots of close angle shots in the rain. It's dog soldiers meets night of the living dead. Let the plague take this one..I won't miss it, but you should."
3,WALKED OUT IN THE THEATER,"I saw this in the theater. I walked out right before it actually started moving.I bought the DVD and thought it was okay.Really, it's nothing but rehashing of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, DAY OF THE DEAD, and RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD.Mike"
2,boring....................,"When i went to the movies to see 28 days later, i was excited. I was hoping to see a very scary movie.....it turned out i saw a movie that could of been very good or very bad..it was very bad. while the specail effects(of the zombies) were very good indeed, but the story was very slow! this film did deliver a creepy way of transforming humans into zombies and a very creepy way the zombies attack he humans. The film needed more suspense and action added to it."
3,Not that great I'm afraid,"The movie is another 'Dead' type movies where a virus from a lab escapes and begins turning everyone into raving homicidal killers. Whether they are really dead or not I never figured out.Now the first half of the movie definitely warrants a five stars. It's suspenseful, scarry, and very interesting. Unfortunately all that is ruined when the people attempting to escape meet up with a bunch of soldiers at an estate in the middle of nowhere. After that it pretty much lost its momentum.Why do they always feel they need to add stuff like what happened in the estate? Oh well, some people like it I suppose.The movie is okay over all, but if you only watch the first half, you'll be more satisfied."
3,A laughable mess.,"The acting was okay but I noticed a little borrowing from Romero's Dawn/Day. This movie wasn't even remotely scary. The so-called ""infected"" look more like they've had a hard night of partying and binge drinking rather than being riddled with some infectuous disease. If your intention is to be scared with this film I wouldn't recommend it. If picking apart major plot holes and laughing at things that are unintentionally humorous spark your interest, then this movie is for you. I went to see this movie in the theater about two years ago and all I can remember was laughing all the way through this mess. This movie was not ""scary as hell"", but I gave it three stars because as far as I'm concerned it was a horror/comedy."
3,not a zombie movie,"ok i was told this was a zombie movie and i hate zombie movies but i have to say i kind of liked the movie. theres a lab mess up, they were infecting test monkeys with pure rage but it is highly contagious and communicable by air and saliva. one of the monkeys gets out of its cage and bites someone. there you go. pure rage. these people lose all of whats inside of them and are filled with nothing but rage.when a young man wakes up in an empty hospital to a world where everyones either dead or turned he starts seeking out for what happened. in this search he meets a small army and they go forward to get to a life where they dont have to run anymore and to kill off all the turned ones that they come in contact with. this movie gets pretty frantic. frantic is about the one way i can describe it because it never rests, theres non stop action in it and i dont mean like action movie. i mean something is always happening. keeps you in it.."
1,Utter garbage.,"I would not recommend you to see this horrible movie. First off, the ending was ridiculous. It started off with promise along the line with Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and then it turned into a very Hollywood version of ""Gunfight and the OK Corral."" For this, Boyle left Hollywood for indie filmmaking??? Another problem I had with this movie was its implausibility. If the infecteds were filled with rage to kill--then why were they killing only the uninfected people and not each other? Finally, I also had a problem with the ending. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie yet--just let me say that it was a major letdown. Very corny. Boyle has a good eye for filmmaking. Maybe one of these days he'll actually make a good movie."
4,Don't waste your money on Blu,"The good news is this is a great movie. The bad news is that it was not filmed in high def. I have to agree with other reviewers that the video quality is really sub-par. It looks like a VHS transfer. Crushed highlights, extremely soft focus, no detail. If you want to buy this, don't waste your money on a Blu-ray ... just get a std. DVD."
3,Twisted love.,"What was the motive of the Major West? To me, Major West wanted Jim for his own pleasure. Overall, a okay zombie flick with a bad ending."
3,The Second half spoiled great potential.,"The first half of the movie, i personally would place in the 'Fantastic' category but falls considerably badly after that with the introduction of British army. There after we are treated to repetative zombie attacks with obvious and predictable outcomes. Not enough tension (like traditional Horror movies) and too much blood and gore for my liking. I feel great shame because the movie had great potential with a fresh and uniqe style but was runied my the dreadfully poor second half. None-the-less the movie is still a decent watch and is worth the three stars which i have given."
3,Pretty Good Until Second Half,This Movie Gave Me A Few Scares And It Was Good Until We Get Into The Second Half Of The Movie. Where The Movie Takes A Completely Different Turn... I'm Not Saying Anything About This Movie Because I Want You To See For Yourself What I Mean. That Opening Scene Is VERY Scary!!!
5,Seriously...,"28 Days Later is beautiful film about group dynamics: love, hate, revenge, pity, and survival. With riveting images, profound characters, and a most impossible situation, this film throws together a moving story of a life with little hope, stuck in a zombie-ridden England, struggling to live on -- to survive."
4,Well Done and Succeeds Beyond its Genre,"I used to love horror movies when I was a kid, because there was always a message about what it meant to be human and how easy it was to lose that humanity. The horror movies of the last 20 years have been more about how much gore you can spray across the screen and characters that are too stupid to survive to the end of the movie. In this film you find yourself actually caring if the principal characters will make it or not and in the process keep the core of what it is to be human."
2,Absolute shambles,"This has got to be one the worst movies. It started off great and after that just killed over. It was slow, boring, and hardly any confrontations till the very end. This is one movie you should leave on the shelves."
2,Most overhyped movie since the Blair Witch,"If you haven't seen Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead this movie might seem original. If you have seen one or more of the above classic horror movies, it will seem, because it is, totally derivative. Either way, the movie is awful. Insights should arise from the characters and story. The character and story should not be used to force insights down the audiences throat. We know that zombies aren't necessaily worse than people after we see 28 Days Later, because Danny Boyle has been jamming that idea down our throats for two hours.I gave the movie two stars instead of zero mostly because of the way the movie was shot. The distorted frames, the views of an abandoned London were all visually interesting. Ultimately, though, the movie is a failure. A contrived plot with a corny, phony script contribute to a moviegoing experience that is not that scary and leaves a bad taste in one's mouth."
3,"Not that scary, but it does work as a drama.","As a horror film, ""28 Days Later"" is only so-so. Its not that scary, the ""zombies"" do alot of chasing but no flesh eating; there made for TV movies that are scarier than this film. However, there are some genuinely tense moments in this movie and the acting and general plotline are very good.Don't buy into the ""alternate ending"" hype, its not worth getting the DVD just for that."
3,28 days long,"What an excellent premise with an excellent sound track, excellent cinematography, and excellent atmosphere. But the movie jumped over some prime opportunities for scares! It just lacked punch!!! This movie is ofcourse comparible to Night of the Living Dead. But lacked so much of what the latter had! I wanted to see more attacks on people. I wanted to see the ""Infected"" attack each other from time to time. Why were they only after the non infected? If they were infected with rage why were they so discriminate? I wanted to see cannibalisim! I wanted to see non infected people getting mauled by mobs of infected! They didnt make the situation seem hopeless enough because the infected lost almost every encounter with the non infected! It annoyed me that the infected only attacked at night. More bodies strewn in the street. I wanted gory details!And unfortunately it fell very short."
4,"A very good zombie movie, nearly a classic, an achievement!!","This will be one of the best zombie movie. Classic Boyle movie - flashy image, editting with full momemtum (as in Trainspotting), male frontal nudity (as in Trainspotting), gore (as in Shallow Grave). Combining all these classic Boyle ingredients and turn them into the first horror movie by Boyle, this is 28 days later.Like some of his movies, we know little about the casts, that makes this movie less Hollywood-like but more 'authentic'.Without disclosing too much about the story, I will say this is a very special zombie movie, more outstanding than Bioharzard, or Lucio Fulci's Zombie."
1,Great film HORRIBLE BLU-RAY,"The film is 5 stars, my complaint is the transfer. Despite the higher resolution it only looks marginally better than on DVD. I even played it on my 1080p computer monitor thinking the problem might have been my 720p television but it had the same problems. The picture is too soft, almost as if it wasn't filmed in HD (but of course it was) and there were specs on the screen as if I was watching it in an old movie house. Hopefully they will release a better transfer of the DVD and give those of us who bought this a discount on it :)"
1,"Boring, slow, not even relatively scary!!","The back of the DVD says the most horrifying movie since the Exorcist!!! 3 alternate endings that will haunt you!! I had to make sure I had the right movie. I've seen scarier episodes of Scooby Doo!! The producers and directors of this must have paid off the reviewers for this film. There was not a SINGLE scary moment in this entire film. Save your time and money. If you do watch this, believe me, you'll be sitting in awe wondering what the heck all of the hype was surrounding this overblown waste of time."
2,This was the WORST HORROR movie i've seen in years!,"Okay, to start this off, this movie was so boring it is not even funny. There were some (emphasis on the some) O.K. parts, but overall, it bored me to death. I couldn't wait for it to end!!! And the ending was also horrible! There was also absolutely no need to show Cillian Murphy naked.... The zombies RAN, which zombies are supposed to not be able to do, and the people turn into zombies in ten seconds!!! Also not supposed to happen! And the virus was spread by monkeys!!!! The movie was also very poorly filmed, like the movies Killjoy(another terrible movie), Pumpkinhead(which was good), and hellraiser. It was filmed as if it was directed and made in the 70's! Take my advice, if you want to go see a zombie flick, see Resident Evil 2 when it hits theaters......"
1,This is Resident Evil without a well developed plot and cast,"The only thing that scared me and made me think when it came to this movie was when I asked myself, ""How did they get financing?!"". And as a big fan of movies dealing with bio-hazardous incidents and in particular, the Resident Evil franchise, that really says something about this movie. The plot was not well organized or developed at all, and in acception to a few concepts of the movie, it was ridiculously unoriginal. I would describe 28 Days later as some kind of mix between the book The Hot Zone and Resident Evil. So if you are planning on seeing this, I'd recommend looking into one of those two instead, you'll be much less disappointed."
1,never got my package; you still have my money!,"I am relatively new to buying items on amazon, so it is very frustrating to both not receive a package and not know how to contact a seller because the original email was lost. Amazon didn't provide any contact for this seller, so i was stuck having paid for a package that never arrived. since i can't give less than 1 star, 1 is what you get."
2,scariest movie of the year?,"Seeing this movie I heard it was so scary, it's just a lot of blood. I admit the movie goes with a good start but then it falls apart after that. The story isnt't all that. But I gave it 2 stars because I have to admit the movies looks great. The production design meaning. But thats about it. Only watch the first twenty minutes and then shut the t.v. off. If all the people of England died, then how come there bodies don't even show? It's ridiculious. It's just a real stupid movie that you shouldn't waste your time on. But it's a british movie so what would you expect? Don't watch this film"
2,Makes no sense,"I must say that this movie really stunk! It just didnt make sense at all.First of all, how come when the city is evacuated at the start of the movie, the main character is left behind in his hospital bed??? And how come he was the only one left behind??? Was he a bad patient?? :-)Secondly, if the RAGE virus takes less then 20 seconds to infect someone and send them into an uncontrolable rage, then how did the city have time to evacuate??Thirdly, if the RAGE virus sends people into a frenzy, then why dont the infected attack each other??These are just some of the things in this movie that dont make sense. This could've been a good movie, but in my opinion, it fails to deliver."
1,28 hours later I wanted a fefund,"This has to be the most boring un-interesting movie of all time. There is no violence, no blood and where is the gore? All these positive reviews have they even watched this lame junk, the worst thing about it are the characters, they are so dull. Even when the so called zombies attack nothing happens, some quick editing and camera movements, the end result someone laying on the floor a mist all the darkness and only arms or legs visable. Take my advise and dont bother with this because it's not even worth 28 minutes of your time."
1,Very bad!,"This movie stinx! I hated it so much. People were laughing at this flick. I wasn't scared and neither was anybody else that saw this movie with me. They all said they thought it was boring, and I agree with that. Skip this."
1,absolutely terrible,"I've only given this one star because it looks good but it really was terrible. I too have seen Silence of the Lambs, and was even more scared by Hannibal which i thought was vastly under-rated. Given the money that was obviously poured down the drain to make this I was appauled by its blatant product placement and the worst acting I think I've ever seen in a film. Ignore the critics. Go see Red Dragon. Far superior."
1,A wretched little film!,"This movie doesn't do anything that wasn't done better in several films: Omega Man, Night of the Living Dead, and Night of the Comet. A few good guys survive, along with a bunch of blood-thirsty zombies who endeavour to kill 'em and eat 'em up! If you love being depressed, this is the film for you!"
2,"Day of the Dead, anyone?","I cannot understand why this movie is so popular. Every critic around praised it as groundbreaking. It's not! It's a remake of Romero's Day of the Dead. The only changes are British accents, running zombies, and a horrid, nightmarishly happy ending. It starts great. You will never forget the first 30 minutes of this movie. Then, it all goes sour. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't suck (except for that ending)- it's not even that bad- it's just a remake of Day of the Dead. This is blatant plaigerism being praised as groundbreaking. I was terribly dissapointed."
1,hate it more then anything,I hate to even waste my time writing a review for this junk! But if a save one person from seeing this film it was all worth while. It's too bad they could have made this film alot better but it's to late. It's not worth the 3.00 to rent it and DON'T even think about buying it!! OK I'm done bi***ing now!
3,"Not bad, but not great","Scariest movie since the Exorcist? Ah, no. Not even close.But maybe British folk scare easier than Americans.28 Days is a good movie, but it's scariest moments rely onsurprise rather than genuine terror.Rest assured Exorcist fans, while 28 Days is a decent flick fora quiet night alone, it does not come close to keeping you awakeall night like visions of Linda Blair's head rotating might."
5,Great End of the World/Horror Film,"""28 Day Later"" is a great ""End of the World""/Horror Film. The cast are for the most part unknows do a great part of bringing the terror of the ""Rage"" virus that has swept most of England, killed many and left a few of the uninfected fighting for survival. The director a great job! This movie should not be missed by any fan of either genres."
1,Horrible Blu-Ray Transfer,"I don't know what happened, but arguably the transfer to Blu-Ray is worse than the DVD. Do not purchase the blu-ray version!"
1,Still Don't Understand...,"Why did this movie get rave reviews? It was too long, too boring, and DID NOT rewrite the ""zombie genre"" which so many people claimed it did. I found the the plot jumpy and inconsistent. There was no real ""feel"" of terror. All that being said, I think the main thing that failed this movie was the outside over-hype. It was nothing that I expected, because if it had been, then it would have been good. Sorry, can't recommend this one."
1,Extremely bad quality transfer,"Don't buy this ""high definition"" disc unless VHS is your definition of HD. Transfer is simply horrible - blown highlights, unsharp, jagged edges all over the place. It is actually worse than DVD since upconverted to 1080p DVD looks better!"
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this movie after see ""Dawn of the Dead."" Some friends recommended it saying that if I liked ""Dawn"", I would like this....hmmm...they were wrong.This movie is somewhat of a rip off and rather lame *as much as I hate that word.* We begin with a rather stupid beginning with activists attempting to free sick monkeys and then suddenly we see a man waking up to find London deserted. We get no action, no scenes of the plague going down, no chaos....nothing. The movie completely skips it. The movie then focuses on a small group of survivors occasionally interrupted bu a few idiotic running plague victims.I don't recommend this movie. If you like zombie movies, check out ""Dawn of the Dead."" It's much more entertaining."
5,Great horror film with added twists,"This is definately one of the most terrifying movies ever thought of. One of the keys to the terror is the style of film, different from most movies. it is quite gruesome and violent, but it is very satisfying as it adds to the incredible terror. however, this movie isnt just gore and flashing lights. it has some excellent actors backing up a well thought out story of just what could, and will, happen to this planet. it also provides very good music which gives you chills. even if u dont get scared easily, i highly reccomend this movie to any horror movie fan!"
4,LIMEY ZOMBIES AT LARGE,"On the other end of the zombie spectrum from Rob Zombie's HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, Danny Boyle's lucid nightmare, 28 DAYS LATER (Fox), is set in a very familiar daylight world of London and rural Britain where a plague of rage has infected the populace. Bits of black humor and flashes of tenderness intersperse the relentless, violent zombie attacks."
1,"grainy picture looks bad on blueray, movie okay","When I pay premium for blueray, I expect the movie to be filmed in high definition. This was almost VHS quality. It should not be offered in Blueray, and the graininess was constantly irritating on my large screen. Possibly the lowest quality blueray I own except for some movies from the 70's and 80's.However, the movie was decent if you can get past the graininess. I would watch the movie again, but buy as regular DVD (which is still overkill for the quality of the grainy film)"
1,blu-ray picture quality horrible,"wow. i love this movie, BUT i rented (glad i did) this movie from netflix on blu ray. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE BLU-RAY VERSION OF THIS MOVIE.there is probably a reason it only costs $20 on blu-ray. think about it. need i say more?"
1,Don't Buy This If You Respect Yourself,"I love horror movies. I really do. This isn't a horror movie, it's just horrible. After the first few minutes, the only reason I continued to watch this was because my boyfriend was watching it and there wasn't anything better to do. It's awful. I don't get why people think this is a good movie or even comparable to the exorcist. It's slow moving and just plain BAD. I don't get how it gives you something to think about...I'm convinced these people are just in denial about how awful this movie really was and they're trying to talk themselves into liking it."
1,BAAADDD MOVIE deserves NEGATIVE STARS for wasting my time,"i don't own the dvd but i saw the movie in theaters and let me just say DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. if you haven't seen the movie then don't buy the DVD. it's a horrible incredibly stupid and NOT SCARY movie. if you saw the movie and liked it (all two of you out there) then by all means buy the DVD, but if not DON'T DO IT"
1,28 minutes later...,"...I found myself ""un""involved & thinking about what I did earlier in the day. After a very boring first 20 minutes I thought that I'd give the movie a few more minutes to pick up. Sadly it didn't pick up enough to hold my attention. I thought the film would have been right up my alley because I love zombie/horror, but it just seemed to take itself way to serious for it's own good. And it's not really a horror film at all. A few chase scenes and some bloody vomit doesn't mean you have a horror film. All and all the biggest problem was that it was overwelmingly dull. 1 star for the chic that hacked up that dude who became infected."
5,Great Movie,This is a must see movie. Great shots really makes you feel like your in the movie. The storyline of this movie is great. And not useing famous actors was a good descion. All the actors did a great job so it doesnt feel fake like some of those apocalyptic movies do.
5,A great Sixpence collection!,"I've just sort of discovered Sixpence None the Richer, but I love their music. This album is great if you don't know what album to start at. The music is very nostalgic and hopeful. The songs Breathe Your Name, Don't Dream It's Over, and Breathe feat. Michelle Tumes, are especially unearthly beautiful."
4,Best of Sixpence NTR!,"Ok, given what was typed from the others, keep this in your mind --- all of the members from this group have gone-on with their lives and went seperate in the stuff that they have done in the group!I think that anyone who likes Sixpence None the Richer should own a copy of this recording ( who knows if anything else will be released for people and when )!!!This is a good collection that will take you around their years in the music field even if you have the original albums ---this is still a good collection and they are on one ( 1 ) CD recording!!!Oh yea, if you have the other recordings done by them in your libary, keep them but add this too it as well! You will not be sorry that you did that in the future days that lye ahead for all of us!Just get this recording!!!"
1,Not a fan,"Admittedly, I'm not a fan and never review music, but have to endure their music on the radio so I'll leave a quick comment. Have you ever listened to music that made you want to climb to the top of the nearest building and hurl yourself off? This is that kind of music. Especially tortuous is the cover of ""Don't dream it's over,"" one of my favorites when performed by Crowded House. However, this bands bubble gum, muzac inspired version makes you pine for William Shatner."
4,Overall worthwhile,"Not so much a collection of the best songs as it is a collection of songs from other compilations, single B-sides, and other rarities. (And yes, their single hits are included here as well.) But having all of these songs in one place rather than having to hunt them down individually is definitely a great asset.The best news of all? Sixpence is back together! Their new album (a Christmas collection) has just been released (as of November 2008) and more is on the way. Can't wait!"
2,Simplistic.,"This book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security, global warming, etc. as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells. The author contributes little to previous books on the subject, such as Rikin's book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public. If anything, the book's original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms. In doing so, the author comes up with some interesting case studies, but it's quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of The Economist, which happens to be the author's employer. Moreover, there was little effort in integrating the various chapters. Overall, a very disapointing book. The author should stick to journalism."
3,"Good Overview, but disappointing... NO quantitative data","The book is very well written and the author has interviewed many leaders in the energy business. But for a field with so many subtle tradeoffs, the book lacks critical numerical information. The conclusions reached lack the authority that might have come with numerical data. It is difficult to believe that the Vaitheeswaran actually graduated from a leading engineering school."
3,Did not impact me,"I purchased the book because I believed it would be a technical analysis of the known availability of fossil fuels, the technical and economic feasibility of alternative fuel sources, and the harmful effects (not impacts) of burning fossil fuels. What a letdown to receive the book and discover that it does not include a single, solitary, graph, figure, table or chart. Instead, the author relies almost exclusively on anecdotal evidence in the form of context-sensitive quotations from various experts in their respective fields.Since I am a novice in this field, the book was mildly entertaining and informative. However, I will be moving on quickly to more technically rigorous examinations of the topics.As a sidenote, the author grossly overuses the word ""impact"" to the point of being distracting. Whatever happened to the words ""effect"", ""affect"", ""influence"", ""change"", ""move"", ""disturb"", or ""perturbation?"" Maybe these words do not effectively ""impact"" the reader?"
4,Edgy angst-filled guitar and drums,"764-Hero is John Atkins and Polly Johnson, and like another NW band the Spinanes, create songs without a bassist. While the songs on this album do contain pop hooks, they are usually buried under various levels of noise and overtones. Atkins' voice warbles and occasionally screams, as on the opening noise-rock feast ""Comb the Carpet"", but occasionally hits some soft notes too, as on the albums closer which pairs an acoustic guitar with extraneous synthesizer noise. ""Wait Until 5"" and ""Check the Address"" are a little more poppy that the other songs, my favorite is ""I'm Lying"" which features Polly's dad Ward on organ, who coincidentally also used to be an Amazon employee."
3,Every woman wanted to marry the prince...,"But Prince Lucas Hansson knew only one woman was fit to be his royal bride. If only he could find her....Enter Annah Lane. According to local legend, the pretty shopkeeper had an uncanny instinct for spotting true love. But the moment she laid eyes on His Royal Hunkiness, she realized she was his destined bride! Annah knew her intuition had to be wrong - the prince needed so much more than a small-town woman like her could give. She'd just have to find him a better match - and she would! - as soon as she could tear herself from his strong yet tender embrace..."
4,lot's of videos,"Well this music DVD has loads of music hits by Pat Benatar. It starts out with her first video to her last video in order. I never knew she married the guitar player, I can see why :0 this music DVD is deffinetly worth buying if you like Pat."
4,The NOT QUITE complete video collection....,"Wow! What a collection of Pat Benatar videos and footage! The commentaries are awesome...you must watch the DVD with the commentary on....I love everything about this DVD collection except that fact that Pat's biggest hit, HIT ME WITH YOUR BEST SHOT, does not appear anywhere in this video collection. Not even as concert footage. How disappointing.I know that Pat herself does not care for the song, but fans do, and it should have been included somehow on this DVD collection.Of course, there were some nice gems on it, and quite a few videos I have never seen...It is still a must have for any Pat Benatar fan!"
5,Yes!!,"I'm really happy that they've come out with this!! I think all singers from 80's should release a DVD with all of their videos, cuz nowadays, you can't expect to watch any on MTV."
4,Great short story.,"This is a great story by Kafka, but probably only about 20 pages long, if that. I just didn't want buyers to be disappointed. There needs to be a good collection of Kafka short fiction for Kindle. The Penal Colony, Report to an Academy, Country Doctor, etc."
2,Buy this at Barnes & Noble. You may return it. Save S&H.,There seemed to be a spicy ingredient in most recipes. My husband's tummy does not do chilis and such. The recipes were more involved than I would prefer but I overlooked it because it was being cooked in one day. But it would have been much more useful if the author had considered the fact that Antacids are a giant industry for a reason. Lots of people have problems here. Include substitutes!
2,limited use,"So far, I have been pleased with the poultry mix and seafood mix ideas. (The book also features a ground beef mix.) It is worth spending time on the weekend to set up 4 dinners/mix when time is scarce, and there is a nice variety of recipes for each mix.However, although we liked the seafood quiche, the directions produced much more volume than my pie pan could hold, and I stayed up late that night preparing macaroni to use the remaining mix. Oddly, my desperation macaroni with crab and tomato tasted better than the crab and tomato quiche. At least I had 3 meals from that experience.The poultry mix resembled chicken salad, but my husband was very impressed with the casserole he threw in the oven on a night with a tight schedule.The weekly menus in the rest of the book seemed less useful. I can't imagine planning a week of chicken every night."
5,Restaurant meals await you at home!,"Loved this book and have given it as a gift. My friends, a couple who are both engineers with their own firm, found it to be the answer. Too many times after a long day they would dine out because it was just too much trouble to go home and cook a good meal and they wanted to relax over dinner. They cook on the weekends now and they say the recipes are delicious and not a bite was wasted. They will freeze smaller portions now because recipes are large. This book fills the bill for people who love to cook but have busy lives and would like to eat delicious meals at home more often. It doesn't pretend to be a way to save money although the items are generally easy to find and grouping the menus as the author has does make efficient use of time and ingredients considering the terrific meals produced. Not for everyone but an outstanding book."
2,The concept works if you have time..,"You could break up the sessions in several parts to make it more manageable. I think the selection of meals is overpriced, too, like the steaks.There are better books on this subject, like Frozen Assets by Deborah Taylor-Hough, and the 30 Day Gourmet."
1,A Game for the Young and the Girly,"First off I got this game over singstar becuase it is compatible with the DDR pad. But it falls short of entertainment as far as the dancing goes. If you like DDR you won't like this. Next let me explain my title, this game was made for girls and guys with high voices. Almost all the songs save about 3 are all very high pitched, and there is no apparent way to adjust the tone of the songs to be able to compensate for those with a deeper voice. Secondly, most of the songs have female leads anyway, which makes it extremely difficult to match if you have even a mildly deep voice. Overall the gameplay isn't very much fun. Get Singstar, it comes with two mics and has a much better song selection."
4,Karaoke Revolution Party,"It's a fun ice breaker at parties. My friends enjoy it very much, and it has a very good selection of music."
3,Only perfect on certain machines,"I tried to use Windows 98 SE on my old laptop, But all I got 16 color display with no sound, PLUS, My flash drive wouldn't install with the drivers in it. When I decided to give Windows ME, The so called Mistake Edition [It's Millennium Edition, But I still find it a mistake on a other machines.] another chance. I got it done with no problems. Display is correct, Sound is working, And my flash drive is fully installed. Sometimes I find this bad Operating System on some machines, But for the Latitude CPT S, This was no Mistake Edition. I would only recommend this if it was worth a penny or free. But if you like Windows ME, Make sure your careful with the money. Make sure your PC or Laptop is perfect for this Version. And don't forget the power saving changes. Make sure you get many updates that you need."
2,Not good.,"Windows ME is even worse than Vista. Vista is much better than ME. I installed Windows ME on virtual machine, and on its first start up after the installation, it gave me the famous ""blue screen of death"". Because of that, I'm mad at the OS and I'm going to be infecting it with malwares and have fun. I'm gonna slaughter ME with viruses. No one should pay for this crap. Get Windows 7."
2,BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have Windows Me on an eMachine 667mhz 64 mb ram 13 gb hd. I see blue screens all of the time! When I quit an MS-DOS Program (properly) I get 5 blue screens! Then windows throws a dialog box at me then 5 more blue screens! I am sick of Me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want stability, get Mac OS X, or if you hate Apple, get Windows 2000 or Windows XP (Pro or Home)"
1,do not buy,Windows me is so unstable when I was in setup I would get errors. When finally got in windows I was getting errors like it was a joke. I personaly think windows me should have stayed beta because it could have been better than the one out now. It is so unstable and unreliable. When I first installed it I went to windows update there must have been over 20 critical updates already regarding windows me. So I recomend everyone to get on the nt kernel becuase 95-me was a JOKE! nt kernel is so stable. I recomend windows 2000 or xp they are serious when it comes to computing.
1,Too many incompatiblility problems!,This was my worst purchase in several years of computer use.It is not compatible with my Visioneer 7600 USB. I think bothVisioneer and Microsoft have problems. I spoke to severalgurus who service many computers and their consensus was thatthey wouldn't purchase it -- Windows 98 is much better. Somestores won't even sell it anymore! It just isn't worth theproblems. Save your money and wait another year when Microsofteliminates bugs from XP.
4,Upgrading without a sweat,"No one likes to have to upgrade an operating system. I went from Win 95 to Win 98 to take advantage of a larger hard drive without having to cut it into smaller 2 GB drives. And to utilize my cable modem via USB, I needed to upgrade to ME.There are a lot of horror stories out there about upgrades. These horror stories worried me--so much so that I started with a blank drive when I went from 95 to 98. But this time, I decided to do the upgrade on top of my system and it went without a hitch.As with any upgrade, clean-up your hard drive (uninstalling unwanted or unnecessary programs and fies) and back up everything. Archive your Outlook address book and emails (choose the archive option in email options and save the .pst file). Worst case scenario is that you have to format your hard drive and start over again. But in this case, I was pleasantly surprised how easy and painless the upgrade went."
2,NO DSL Support,Be careful. Most DSL providers do not currently support this OS.If you want broad band access via DSL check with your provider first before moving to ME. SBC one of the largest providers of DSL in the US has no ETA set for supporting this product.
1,Stay Away From ME!,I bought a brand new computer and it come with me installed on it and it has been a nightmare ever since. This system crashes all of the time or locks up and I am constantly turning it off at the surge strip because it has locked up and won't shut down. My husband and I bought some games to play and it locks up and won't even run the games. I have called to get technical support and they dont' have a clue and I have had it. Going to take it in and get xp installed and save my self the headache!
1,Stay away from it,"I program computers, and we had number of compatibility problems with this OS. MS dropped much of good old DDE, causing number of shell application to crash, including number of uninstall programs."
3,I think it works fine,"I have a comp that used to have Win2000Pro and WinME installation. But then I got a new 40gig HD and just reinstalled ME. Win2000 has more features and is more stable but ME starts up sooo much faster and works fine for everything I do. And I have had a day when it hasn't crashed! :) System restore is also handy! I will probobly get XP though, just cause EVERYONE says it is SOOO much better. But i'd day that it is fine unless your running a server or need an ultra stable system so you can watch the stocks every second and strike it rich."
3,Not bad if you learn how to use,"I think alot of the people writing these really bad reveiws on Me , have not taken the time to learn the solutions to there problems within ME. Using your MSCONFIG to adjust your startup and eliminate programs you dont need running at startup , is a good start. Increasing your RAM , makes ME much more stable , a inexpensive upgrade thats good if your a gamer or use alot of graphic editing software. When I frist recieved ME preloaoded on a new system I purchased I was about to switch to 98 . However after the RAM upgrade , adjusting the system config utility I have yet to have a problem with Windows Me since !"
5,The Best OS ever! If you work with it!,"Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition can be a great operating system program if you work with it! Well...I have a computer that came with Windows XP Home Edition, and I saw that I was more use to Windows Me, and put that on. Worked fine! All you need to do is work with it! I saw some other reviewers, and they came up with alot of problems. Here may be a solution, when you first start Windows Me, and have an internet connection, don't do the all updates at onec,and you shouldn't install your software so quickly, That causes problems, because I use to do that. I only installed my most used programs the first week, then moved on. Still works without any errors! Maybe, I have had one blue screen of death in the whole years that I have had Windows Me. Overall, it is great! Or if you want to buy Windows XP, then it includes all the features of Me, and reliablity of Windows 2000 Professional. Good luck if you're buying Windows Me!"
1,terrible,Why not the dos programs? I can't believe that you guys would stoop so low not to have access to the program that made you born.
1,Total WASTE of money. it ...,Trust me! Stay away from this piece of garbage. If you like system hang ups and blue screens then this is the product for you. Driver incompatabilities and it will not recognize non plug and play devices. It you buy this GOOD LUCK.
3,Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition,"Win Millennium is just an ok upgrade to win98.Dont expect any drastic changes over Win 98 just like Win95 upgrade over Win3X or even Win98 upgrade over Win95.Why does microsoft want to remove the dos mode.It operates smoothly than win98.It does boast of Intenet Explorer 5.5,Windows Media Player 7 and others but you can install them on windows 98 too.The best thing about ME is the backup which retores the sys files deleted by mistake.I would not recommend this product to persons who have Win 98SE installed, Just a few changes over Win98 wouldnt make you wanna buy this."
1,Don't even think about it,"I usually spend considerable time crafting my reviews on Amazon. However, in this case let me make it short and simple: Don't even think about it. The only possible redeeming value Me might have is as a gift to your worst enemy. In all other cases, avoid it like the plague (which it is). XP works. Me doesn't. Got it? Good. Now leave this page immediately and don't look back!"
1,retarded,simply put.. why did my dad spend hard earned money on this trash... i have to admit.. it was fun deleting the worthless shortcuts on the desktop
1,Don't ever buy this,"For those who says that ME works properly, I would like to know which computer they have. ME is garbage.....I was going crazy everyday, reinstalling the program. I was a master, an expert doing that. An everyday new crash. I bought XP and my life changed, My girlfriend now loves me and everything is different in my life."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON WINDOWS ME!!,"We bought 2 HP Pavilions for our office with Windows ME loaded on them. They are a nightmare. You just simply have to get used to re-booting several times per day. I habitually restart the pc every few hours just to avoid the inevitable crash....BR>At the very least, get XP or 2000. Anythind but ME."
1,The worst thing to happen to the PC since...................,".......it was invented. Windows ME came with my new machine a P1500 with 128 Megs of RAM. When the machine is turned on it loads at lightning speed.It's all downhill from there. ME is unstable, crashes and locks up regularly. It is slower than my old pentium pro 200 with 96 megs of RAM running Win98 (which I have been forced to pull out of the closet to setup once again)If you are interested in connecting a web site to a database, or even just learning how to do it, (with a program such as Macromedia UltraDev) ME does not support Personal Web Server, so you will have to go back to 95, 98, or get Win 2000 to explore this arena.95, 98, or 2000 may be better choices than waiting for XP to come out. If you change the configuration of your computer ""too much"", XP will lock up your computer and you will have to call Microsoft to get an code to unlock it. What will they think of next?"
2,Ugh.,"Well, let's start from the beginning. Microsoft wanted to get something out for the big ""Millennium."" So, they beefed up 98 with a few ""prettier"" functions, made things look a little different, packaged it off, and whoosh-an easy ten million. Now us, the people who rush out to buy the ""new"" Microsoft product and set it all up. Before you know it, everything's gone wrong. Your RIO doesn't work, your games aren't playing, and every time you try to fix it-something else goes wrong. Welcome to Windows ME. Ha. The only, possible way if you would use this is if this is your buisness-only computer because it's okay at formatting. But anyone that's a mediocre gamer, uses cameras, downloads games for palms, or does anything else except type. This not for you."
1,extremely poor compatibility,"I bought the computer from Dell, so I don't have to bother to install it. However, the installation of other hardwares was like being grilled in Hell. My PC camera, my scanner, my printer, and lots of other drives are not compatible with WinME. The worse is most of manufactures do not have WinME compatible drivers; or they just claim their drivers are compatible, and they ""should"" work...Since my computer is still within 30 days after purchase, I am considering to change it to Win98 SE, I feel that's the most stable edition."
2,Windows Me? Try Windows 98 SP2.,"Okay, I have to admit, it really looks like Microsoft took Windows 98 SE, and added a few upgrades, like Movie Maker, WMP7, a few new drivers, and slapped a new name on it. It crashes even more than the disappointing 98 versions.You really need to consider if it's worth buying Me. I would reccomend sticking with your current operating system, upgrading to Windows 2000 (MUCH better), or waiting for the final release of Windows Whister (A.K.A Windows 2001, Windows NT 5.1 and Windows.NET 1.0), which will be Microsoft's first consumer-targeted NT version.Forget about me."
1,Worst OS for game playing!!,I have to say that ME is the worst Operating System I've ever encountered. Blue screen after blue screen error is all I get every time I played games on it. I even blue screen errors when I'm not playing. I finally got fed up with and switched to XP. Much better OS than ME. Don't ever consider buying this. It's not a good idea.
1,What was Microsoft thinking? Apparently not much...,This is the worst Windows operating system I have ever come across. My computer crashes constantly and I have noticed many flaws in the performance of ME. I would have to say that chossing ME over 98 is the biggest mistake I have ever made and I hope that you read this and won't do the same.
4,"Could be better, but it's come a long way since WIN 95/3.1","I have WIN ME on a Compaq 5WV280 system and while I have had a few problems with it in the beginning, after downloading some updated drivers and dat file, I found the crashes pretty much stopped. The only real problem that I've had with WIN ME is that it won't let me play my older DOS based games (Unearthed Aranca - D&D/AD&D games) Other than that, it's worked just fine for me, especially since more and more software and hardware manufacturers are starting to support it."
1,BUggy and Unstable 2 hours after use,"this, in my opinion, is a pre release of Windows XP, which will be as stable if not more than win 2000, but i ordered a new laptop from Dell with WinMe on it and it started with blue screen errors and random errors within probably 2 hours of use, luckily i could change to WIn2000 from Dell free of charge, it doesn't matter how powerful your coputer even if it is 1.8Ghz P4, WinMe is toatly buggy you get very mad and frustrated with it very quickly,, don't waste you money...."
1,Don't try to buy it!,You get errors/XP installs the Internet for you. ME hates you. XP is your friend. I had ME and I thought It was good. Then I discovered the truth. ME isn't good at all!!! It should be 5.00 instead of 199.99
1,A Piece of Junk,"I have had ME since March 2001. It has turned out to be the worst piece of junk you could imagine. Bill Gates should be ashamed of himself for sticking it to the public by ever releasing ME in the first place. I spend more time with boot up problems, shut down problems and ""just trying to get things done"" problems. This system couldn't manage memory resources if it's life depended on it - which I guess it does as it keeps dieing on me. In a nutshell: don't buy it! Don't even take ME for free. You will live to regret it if you do."
3,Weakest Windows since 95.,"I don't think this edition was worth releasing when the superior, more reliable Windows 2000 was being released in a matter of months. I used it for a period on someone's machine and the main thing I remember was that it wasn't very reliable, I remember it had problems recognising two separate CDR drives. Alot of the usual Windows options you'll find are gone aswell. It's OK, but if you have a new machine then go for XP or 2000, and if not use 98SE."
1,TRASH!!!,"I bought a comp with windows me on it and tried to use nortons anit-virus 2002 without realizing it has an in compatability problem, now my whole hard drive is fried!! THANK YOU MICROSOFT!!!if you can avoid it, do it."
2,Waste of money,"Since buying Windows ME when it first came out, I've had to reinstall it several times -- every couple of weeks seems to be the average -- due to crashes and other mishaps.Also, the automatic update feature doesn't work as well as hoped. I downloaded and installed some updates just fine, but was not able to install certain other updates.The System Restore function, which is supposed to let you restore your system to a previous point and was a major reason for my move to ME, only worked about a third of the time I had to use it. The other two-thirds of the time, WinME told me that I was unable to restore to the point I wanted.I'd say, stick with 98, as the new features are only incremental in nature. Or go with Windows 2000, which is what I plan to do very soon."
2,Too many commercials,"Bought a new Compaq Presario that came preloaded with Win ME. My biggest complaint is that they (Compaq and Microsoft) have cluttered the desktop with commercial inducements, some of which cannot be removed! It's like buying a new TV that plays Sony commercials every 5 minutes no matter what content you've chosen. I paid for an intellectual tool and I get someone else's marketing platform. When are companies going to learn that we're all not stupid consumers and that they have to show respect?So I upgrade to Win 2000 and find that the Compaq modem doesn't work and Compaq informs me that it will never work under Win 2000. Since the Win 2000 installation reformatted the hard disk and Compaq didn't include Win ME disks or CD-ROMs, Compaq expects me to pay for new software! Over my dead body!Frankly, ""Pride comest before the Fall"" - Compaq and Microsoft should be taking that piece of wisdom to heart. Maybe I should look into Linux."
1,Windows Upgrade?,"Ive worked with microsoft products for over 10 years, and with all the hype behind Windows ME to make a change for the better, they should have just trashed it and started over. Since windows 98 microsofts attempts at making a better OS has been failing. I will say win2000 Is awsome. But this last attempt at a win9x system is sad. I have never had programs sit and wait before like in ME. Waiting for what??? I have no idea. But the programs sit for 10seconds to 1 minute waiting to run. Or the programs get paused and you cant access it temporarily. No other version of windows I have used has done this to me. The internet connection lags alot also. If you need a OS to get your PC going, This one doesnt seem to be the right one to go with."
1,Garbage,I have this OS on an old laptop and it is truly madning. Crashes like there's no tommorw. Security holes the size of the ozone.
1,Major Pain in the Tush,"If you like frequent crashes, freezing and the inability to use certain programs such as System Restore, by all means, go with Windows ME. I bought my computer new with the ME program on it and within 3 months I was an expert at re-installing the ME program. Every time I would download clip art or anything from the internet, ME would begin going haywire. I would have to erase my download immediately or ME would continue to disentigrate until I'd have to totally erase my computer and re-install the ME program, as well as all my hardware software... and after a while, ME did not want to accept any of my printer, scanner, camera or drivers hardware. It would just keep telling me it couldn't find it. Can't wait to get rid of it!!!"
2,Why is it always ME?,"I Have a Windows ME Computer and a Windows XP Computer. The only reason why I am keeping ME is because I can play Star Trek TNG: A Final Unity that will not work on my Xp computer. If you have Win. 3.1, 3.11, 95, 98, 98SE, 2000, and ESPECIALLY ME! Get Windows XP Home Edition or if you want to play those picky old MS-DOS games, get Windows 98SE! Don't wate your money on this JUNK!"
1,Bad Luck,It is the worst operating systerm I have ever used. I can't hook my webcam or microphone up. DO NOT buy this product!!!
1,Terrible Experience -- Shame on Microsoft,"My experience with Windows ME has been horrible -- and I see no improvement on the horizon, short of going back to Windows 98 or paying Microsoft more money for yet another Windows release. In four months of use (ME came with a new Dell PC), I've suffered two major crashes that service technicians attributed to ME. There seems to be some glitch between ME and Word 2000, which also came with the computer. Further, as an AOL subscriber, there is some kind of incompatabilty betwen ME and AOL. Get used to waiting to get quick access to AOL and don't be surprised when you're given the news that AOL has disconnected you. A problem with AOL? No, when I revert to Windows 98, using the same AOL access telephone numbers, no problem.I'm profoundly disappointed with Microsoft for apparently rushing to dump a flawed operating system on an unsuspecting public. Equally disappointed with Dell for distributing this horrible software.Where are the lemon laws for software?"
1,Minus 3 star rating,"I got a new laptop with ME installed. Its a 750 PIII with 128 mb ram and 12. gig harddrive. I've had nothing but trouble with ME since I first booted the machine up. I can't get hardware to work with ME, even though it's listed as ME compatible so far I've tried several different mouse, a printer, digital camera and a zip drive. I've downloaded drivers for the different items and still no luck, I want to go to Windows 2000 but will probably lose some features like FireWire. If you want to ever be able to hook up any addtional hardware to your system then don't get ME."
1,ME or just a money spinner,"Windows ME is not what I expected. I wouldn't even give this product a 1 star rating(no other choices). It has crashed my computer so many times since I got the software, I've lost count. It is not worth the money you pay for it. Microsoft should give it away for free. Even then I wouldn't touch it. I'm going to enjoy deleting it when I get Windows 2000."
2,Free at last...,"When I bought my computer 18 months ago, it came with Windows ME. After reinstalling it 3 times in that 18 months due to its instability, I finally broke down and bought XP. You see, if you try to install an application built to run with Win95, not only will WinME not run it, it will gradually cause the system to fail. Then again, sometimes it will just go on the blink for no reason at all. All of a sudden your modem gets a configuration error, or your sound stops working, and you have no idea what caused it. For some reason, it would load extra devices like crazy until it dragged performance down to nothing. About every 4 months, I would have to go into safe mode and delete the extra devices from the device manager. At one point, the device manager showed that I had 60 primary and secondary IDE controllers loaded for my hard drive.Anyway, take my advice and buy the Windows XP upgrade instead. It's cheaper and more stable by far."
1,blows,just got windows me. It is the worst o/s I have ever seen. It crash's 10 times more then windows 98 and if you work at home and have windows 2000 and like to make the computer a twin boot it won't work well with it. Just don't buy it.
4,A Noticeable Improvement,"After a hitch free install, Windows ME has yet to give me any major headaches after around 2 months of use now (got a copy from Tech Data before the official release date). My system is a Duron 700, 128 MB RAM, Asus A7V, Geforce2 MX, SB Live!, and IBM 75GXP 30 GB ATA-100 Drive. Aside from some minor DUN problems (most of which were likely caused by an ISP upgrade and a flaky winmodem), Windows ME has yet to be the nightmare it has been for other users. I did nothing special, just simply did a clean install on an empty drive, and have had no problems. I admit I haven't stressed it out much, but I would consider my computer use that of the average net/game junkie, so I've been somewhat surprised reading the other reviews. Maybe I just got lucky with a configuration that WinME can handle with no hassle. From my experience I can say for me it is more stable than Win98B (I have yet to experience a B.S.O.D., and only a couple of random lockups...pretty good for Windows, IMO)"
1,This book is not for me,"Did not like the book at all. It is old book, with lots of lots of recipes all over the place. This book for old style bread making. The steps are not well defined and there are no pictures at all. It is hard to select recipe because there are no pictures and by reading cooking steps I could not really comprehend what you end up at the end. This is just not my book, and it went straight to Salvation Army."
3,"Oldish by now, sorry to say","As good as it may look at first there are problems under the surface. The book is printed in 2000 meaning that PHP installation is out of date, for instance. Moreover, the 40+ pages about JServ integration are pure junk as the product JServ no longer exists and has been replaced by a totally different product (Tomcat). Also, there are several things that are not discussed at all even though they are referred to (the htdocs directory, for instance). As somebody stated all of this information can be found more up-to-date in the Internet now. I like the book, however :-)"
5,Professional Apache Book Review!,"Professional Apache is the book for anybody who needs to get the most out of the Apache Web Server. If you're thinking of setting up Apache for the first time, or of moving an existing web site to a dedicated machine, then this book will help you..."
5,Rajesh's review,"The book has a step-by-step explanation of everything that Apache does and you can do with Apache. It even has tutorials on basics like regular expressions, HTTP headers. If you want a book that tells you about Apache -- this is it. You dont need another. In a single word , fantastic."
4,An Encyclopedia of Economics,"If you're at all interested in Austrian economics, Rothbard's _magnum opus_ is an essential reference. The whole of Austrian methodology and economic thought is contained in this massive text. Whether you're teaching yourself the basics of Econ, or just want to experience some of the most controversial, cutting-edge thought in the financial sciences, Man, Economy and State is one to watch out for.PRO:+ Assumes nothing; teaches you economics from the ground up.+ Thorough and detailed.+ If you find an edition with the rare last chapter, ""The Economics of Violent Intervention in the Market,"" the book is worth its weight in gold: it's a political treatise AND economics compendium in one.CON:- A bit on the dry side; Rothbard's vocabulary and syntax tend towards the dense.- Don't expect a lot of graphs. Get used to it: Austrians don't like graphs.- Threateningly heavy."
3,Informative but slightly tilted,"This novel is basically written as two different nonfictional thrillers in one. The first is the historical upbringing of a young nation and the events that led to the aggressions between Pakistan and India. In my opinion this part of the book is nicely written and is more of a historical outline rather than an opinionated article, even though the authors do put some witty comments explaining these past events. The second part of the novel is a little more opinionated, explaining the current drift of Pakistan with religious factors involved. This part of the book seems a bit one sided and doesn't put all the perspectives on the table. I have lived in Pakistan and the religious extremism is defiantly does not represent the majority of the country. This is a good reference book to read in order to understand the current situation with Pakistan and the American so called War on Terrorism but is defiantly not the only source on should use to understand such a deep topic."
5,Excellent from beginning to end!,"Rarely do I find a CD that I love from beginning to end. Toby Lightman's ""Little Things"" is a CD you won't skip any songs over. I wouldn't have found this gem had my hometown radio station played the single ""Devils and Angels"" and immediately I was hooked and had to know who sang it. If you like Amanda Marshall, Fiona Apple, Alana Davis or the like, then you'll love Toby Lightman."
4,A little bit of everything,"Stumbled on a really great artist in Toby Lightman. A lil soul, a lil folk, a lil classsic R&B, she bundles it all with a very distinct sound. No bubble gum here. You'd be hard pressed to find any other current release to compare. Let's say Nellie Furtado meets Alana Davis with a bit of Joan Osborn on the side. Nice mix of rhythms, horns and guitar. Clean and crisp, nothing over done. Worth a listen, over and over again."
5,The Best New Artist of 2004,"Toby's debut album is clearly a masterpiece. I'm really thrilled to have spotted such fine talent so early in her career. While Devils and Angels has been getting all the radio play lately, my personal favorite is The River. Toby's soulful voice provides an excellent companion to the lyrics in the song. I highly suggest you pick up this CD today and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Toby is in motion to take the place of Sheryl Crow."
4,A solid CD from an amazing voice,"I ran and bought this CD as soon as it came out, since I loved the single they play on MTV. I must say that the single is by far the most remarkable song of the CD, the rest is kind of below. Still, Toby Lightman's voice is very impressive and to have someone with such poweful cords go into the singer songwriter genre (where voices are usually more mellow) is quite refreshing. If you like women singer songwriters this is definitely for you. The soul-and-folk appeal to the whole disc makes it also an option for people looking for original and listenable music. The only flaw is that at some points the CD feels redundant. Still the range of the songs is wide enough for it to be worth it."
4,betta acoustic,toby lightman performed for the vocal students at my school and and it was juss her and the guitar and it sounded 10 times better than the cd!!!!!! it really showed her beautiful voice....nonetheless her cd is very inspiring i really love it and i love the fact that she writes her stuff..she is a true talent and i hope she comes out wit an acoustic cd in the future...she is also a very nice person she was really cool to all us and answerd questions 2...i hope later on fame doesn't get 2 heR!
1,Oh Please!,"This is in reference to all those people who said that Toby Lightman's version of ""Real Love"" was better than Mary J. Blige's. Apparently, Mary is still making albums, putting out hit music, AND getting radio airplay. And where is Toby Lightman? I REST MY CASE!"
1,Are we hearing the same music?,"I truly don't understand how she can have such a high rating at amazon.com. I first saw her CD out on display at the music store, came and looked her up, there were so many great reviews I thought i'd give her a try. Unfortunately, I was sadly dissapointed. Her voice is annoying and the music seems monotonous. Perhaps she does have talent a few years from now but as far as this album goes - i wouldn't even put it in my buy used list."
1,What a joke!,How dare you even attempt to butcher Mary J's song? have you ever heard the orginal.. She doesn't this song a very injustice!
4,Nothing Little Here,"This was a refreshing cd. It was something different. Toby has a very nice voice and she had some beautiful melodies on her cd. I love her remake, of Real Love. It sounds awesome! This was a great start for her. Her and Joss are truly some of the new greats of music now and in the future."
5,Gotta listen to this one!,"Her whole cd is great! I was hooked once I heard her single ""Devils and Angels"" on the radio. I really respect female singer/songwriters like her because they have real talent and aren't just there to look pretty and lipsync. I love Toby's voice and her cd and can't wait for the next one!"
5,Great 1st CD,I love this CD. It is great listening. This CD is different from other music out there. It is awesome that these are all songs she wrote. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys nice relaxing and fun music.
5,Little Things is amazing!,"Toby Lightman's Little Things contains the perfect blend of Sheryl Crow and Lauryn Hill, with a soulful light rock sound that really touches you. The CD is a wonderful and powerful compilation of songs that you can actually relate to. I'm definitely looking forward to the next album."
5,chitown,This CD is phenominal! There are very few cds that you can listen to straight through. Every song on 'Little Things' is great...Toby is a truly talented new artist who is just beginning.
3,"Not Bad, Not Good","I really wanted to like Toby because she's a local Jersey girl but I can't recommend this CD very highly. She's compared to a lot of other singer/songwriters in these reviews and for good reason - she sounds like someone you've heard before. In other words, if you demand a little originality in your music, you probably won't find it here. The woman does have some talent but she's unfortunately being guided in the direction of ""hit"" artist when that's probably not her thing. The good news is... if you happen to like the women she sounds like (that ground is covered in other reviews) and you like your music safe and ""familiar,"" you'll probably like this. If your expectations are a little higher than that, check back with Toby in a few years - if she survives the biz that long."
3,"Fantastic Voice, Crummy Production","Why music gods? Why oh why did you sacrifice Toby Lightman's amazing voice to cheesy, Max Martin-esque synth-drenched production? Why did you take real talent and overdub, overlayer, and overpower it?Such is the fate of Toby Lightman. As far as vocals go, this girl-with-a-guitar has got the supremely powerful, expressive, and bluesy-gritty chops needed to make her a star. But, thanks to producer David Wright, that voice can barely be heard over all the looping drums, booming synthesizers, and other Avril/Hilary-type squealing background fodder.Pass on this one. Maybe in a few years Toby will have enough confidence in herself to make an acoustic, lo-fi record. When she does, I'll be first in line to buy it."
1,The West Wing The Complete First Six Seasons,"The West Wing - The Complete First Six SeasonsThe second season included two each of disc 2 and NO disc 1. There may be other issues as well, that I have just not gotten to yet."
5,The single most important book of American film criticism.,"When it first appeared in the late '60s, Sarris' book was literally memorized by critics, students and teachers. It provided a root approach to discussing film, quickly absorbed, and readily shaped to one's personal tastes. A beautiful combination of reference and aesthetic, it ushered in the era of ""the director as superstar,"" and was completely absorbed by everyone in film. Unfortunately, its absorption was so complete, the author, Mr. Sarris, was for the most part uncredited and unrewarded."
3,Analysis Falls Short,"Jonathan Richmond spins a good tell about the planning process for the Long Beach Blue Line. He argues that the process was inherently flawed and biased towards rail, while berating both the forecasting used for the project and travel demand modeling in general.Unfortunately, he failed to demonstrate whether an expanded express bus network on the I-710 freeway would do better over time than the rail line. This is because he doesn't have a alternative comprehensive analytical process of his own to prove his point! Maybe if he worked as a transportation planner for a major transportation agency or consulting firm for a few years, he would be able to offer a more thoughtful critique."
3,MAGNIFICANT!,A BEAUTIFUL VIDEO OF COLORADO SCENERY & AWESOME SINGING. IVAN PARKER'S MOUNTAIN ON HIS MIND WAS WONDERFUL! AMERICA WAS FABULAOUS!
3,St Michael,"The product more or less met my expectation. It is nicely made. I received it within the time frame indicated in the original purchase order. It was well packaged to decrease the chances of damage. The only problem I had was with the shipping cost. I don't know how the cost was calculated because it didn't match Amazon's chart for shipping. Quite frankly I wanted the object and didn't dispute the cost of shipping. I also had to pay a 13. UK Custom fee on top of the high shipping cost. Although Amazon shipping page warns about such possibility, but the retailer should have given me some indication as to what to expect. I assumed the high shipping cost included the custom charges as well, but I was wrong. All the fees should be listed clearly and in a greater detail. An item of $45 ended up costing me 80 GBP in total! Otherwise the product and shipping was fine."
5,Saint Michael the Archangel Stature,"This statue of Saint Michael is a very nice addition to anyone's office or other room in the house. It has an antiques bronze look and a heavy weight to it. It is also the perfect size at 15"" in height it is not too big but doesn't look tiny either."
4,Pretender-Loose in L.A.,Crissis hyde is a rock godess! This was a great show and I am glad it was caught on DVD.
3,Sound got better as it went along,"The sound of the band seemed far away compared to Chrissie's voice. The guitar, bass, keys and background vocals were hard to hear for the most part. That did seem to improve later in the concert. I could do without the vulgarities which were unnecessary. Chrissie's prancing got a little tiring as well. She sure thinks a lot of herself. Highlights were ""Middle of the Road"" and "" Mystery Achievement"", both not surprisingly toward the end, they rocked. ""Kid"", and ""Brass In Pocket"" were good as well."
3,Too small and short,The screwdivers are too small. The handles are small and short. The shafts are also short. Not happy. I thought they would be better than klein but I was wrong. Back they go.
1,So what?,"This book has a nice cover, but when you go inside the content is a disappointment. Not particularly gay and not particularly interesting either.With so many other, better gay astrology books out there you could do better."
4,Great Guide To Characterization,"This book is a very valuable insight to the writer who has no idea how to work with characterization (would someone mail a copy of this to Robin Cook?). Kress covers all aspects of characterization--from what you need to know about your character, how to use it, character growth, and how character and plot work together. She also provides great examples to click home what she is trying to explain to you. Her examples come from a wide variety of literature (though my favorite was her example from Stephen King's Carrie). This is important to all learning writers."
4,Entertaining and Helpful,The reader-as-aspiring-author needs to know a little something on his own about writing dialog and creating characters. But it is a great refresher to return to again and again as you are polishing your story or novel.
5,Delightfully Detailed,I was very pleased with Nancy Kress' book and the information that she provided on building characters. I've been looking for a source that would help me along the way in developing 'real' characters for my stories and I think I've found just that. Great job.
3,Practical but Superficial,"This book was loaded with practical information, and I did find parts of it very useful. I was hoping for an insight into the intricate and complicated relationship between plot and character."
5,"Superb, Live, Rowdy New Orleans Jazz!","If you like your jazz neat and smooth you'll want to avoid this CD. However if you like your jazz raw and raucous then you'll love this disc as much as I do. It it also a rare chance to hear the trombone of the wonderful Earl Humphrey. His two brothers (trumpeter Percy and clarinet wizard Willie) are much more famous from their travels and recordings with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, but Earl is every bit the jazzman that his legendary siblings were. Take a chance and get this fantastic session and experience some fun and swinging New Orleans Jazz like they don't play anymore."
4,overall very good,"I've used this a few times, and overall it's very good. Too good sometimes, in fact, that it is so bright it can overpower and wash out your photos if you don't get it set right. It was a little tricky getting the flash set up to coordinate with my Canon 650IS, but follow the instructions, and you'll be fine."
4,"Tina arena, a very underrated tallented woman","I will be honest, i would have loved this cd better if it had her very early work, such as songs as ""i need your body"" and ""strong as steel"" from her first album. I just love Tina though, in my opinion she was underrated from the very beginning, she has such a beautiful voice and sings with so much emotion much better than kylie minogue who is more famous in australia, my favourite songs are ""sorrento moon"" one of the most romantic songs i've ever heard and it shows a tallent that kylie minogue lacks which is why i love tina and other songs like burn ,chains(probably her most famous song) and ""now i can dance"" but most of her work is really good."
4,Enough About Amber,"I'm so sick of getting on any female diva message board or postings at all and seeing this guy writing about Amber. It's very obnoxious. Write about Amber at Amber's site or in comments about her album. I personally really like Amber's new album too, but stop."
4,Gift for Grandkids,"After reading this book at our County Food Bank, I thought that it would be excellentfor my grandkids as they have a garden and are starting at a young age tocook. It has a lot of healthy information and some recipes."
2,Poor quaity,Bought this as bridesmaids gifts and had to return this item. Item more suited for a child. Pendant ok but chain thin and of poor quality.
4,Poor quality disks,"The episodes all played just fine, but something is wrong with the disks themselves(bent or warped or something). They will not play in my computer and will cause the DVD player to sound like a lawn mower at certain times. Still watchable on a DVD player and a good purchase, just annoying that the disks are bent/warped and will not play on my computer."
4,Obviously there are no true fans to Gundam Seed,"I have been a gundam fan for years I first started out with Gundam Wing and found myself searching for various other gundam titles. What i liked most about gundam seed is the artists evolution of the gundam series. no longer are gundams invulnerable to attacks but they take damage unlike gundam wing, no longer is the protagonist a strong steroid enhanced muscle with no fear of danger of his life. Gundam seed pushes further down showing the true feelings and motives for a pilot of a gundam. And for the first time we are able to see the pilot get a girl, no not just by using our imagination. to me that is a great improvement. True gundam fans realize that this nature is new and refreshing, rookies need to dig deeper and do their homework."
3,Why is it that every time i watch this show its so boring?,"I dont have this dvd nor do i want it. I saw the first episode on TV. it was ok. The next time i watched it , I had no idea what was going on (reason G Gundam is my fav, you can watch it at episode 12 or so and have an idea what is going on) and every time i watched it since all they do is talk talk talk. It bores me out of my mind! Yet this series is so popular theyre making a sequel! Why couldnt they make a sequel for G or Wing? Maybe ill like it if i get the DVDs... I give the series three stars instead of two for the possibilty that ill like it if i saw an episode when the Gundams do SOMETHING beside stand around! or see a battle! Or something other then talking!"
3,For tasteless anime fans who can't do without flare,"When I first watched Gundam SEED I thought it was quite tasteless even before I watched the 1979 version of the original. As a couple of others have said, it is just an immitation of the first Mobile Suit Gundam series for those newbie anime fans who would get bored of the original simply because it doesn't have extremely cool looking Gundams that fly around shooting off martial arts and have a beam rifles/guns planted in every single limb possible.I have to say even if it does have its differences...this series is just a lame and flashy wannabe of the first Gundam series to be released. If you are interested in REAL Gundam series check out Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, 08th MS Team and Char's Counterattack."
3,Real bad set for a good series,"All the Gundam series is a very popular and very good anime, yet this set is really bad. I understand it's somewhat of a budget friendly edition, but it exceeds the limits. I read reviews of disc issues and thought they were unlucky guys, but it actually happens, 2 of mine froze on the first play! You can tell from the disc stickers and the menu formatting that this is a really low budget production. I don't mind this, but if you're into extras they're almost non-existant.The series is great and you get all the mecha fights and political battles, I would just highly consider looking for another version somewhere."
3,good but..,good but only down side is when it was shipped one of the dvds got loose and ended up getting scratched.
2,"Starts good, ends weak","I have to admit, this show started well....alright. I was alittle ticked on the unoriginality of reusing old MS designs like the Zaku, Dom, Gouf, etc. But besides that the show started just as strong as any other anime would have. But, as many others agree, it goes on a steady decline into the ""Its just not worth it zone"". Don't get me wrong, I stuck with this to the end, and my expectations weren't very high, but repeated animation to its upmost extreme, a crappy reused script, and poor character development really overshadows all the fighting and cool beams flying in random directions. So to conclude, the animation is appealing (as limiting to new drawings as it is), but the story slowing declines into a 3rd grade fiction english paper. It really could have been better. *And yes, their are scenes copied from Zeta as exact as the angle the characters are looking, its kinda sad, even if this is abviously a new gen. zeta remake*"
4,"Good, but not as good as I remember...","It is good for the stake of nostalgia, but compare it to other Gundam series and Wing does not hold up very well. If you buy it expect lots of talking and battle sequences that, at times, are a little forgettable."
4,Yet another great blowing session,"Like the disc, Introducing Wayne Shorter, this is another blowing session from VeeJay records. It is really a good record in good sound. It is like so many of the blowing sessions from the Prestige label in the 1950's. It is really quite good and worth a listen. It does not feature distinctive arrangements or compositions, but it is fun."
3,It's a shame . . .,". . . the publisher felt obliged to charge so much for this book, especially when other books written by experts in the field cost no more than a third this much. Gee, I wonder if that has something to do with its sales rank? I hope to see this one on the bargain tables before the state of the art information becomes dated."
1,DISHWANDMC2PACK,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH PURCHASING. THE SPONGE ENDS COME LOOSE IMMEDIATELY WHEN USING AND FALL OUT!
4,"Good tool, but short","I wish they described how long the wand is on the product description. I think it's maybe 6 or 7 inches long? Not long enough to scrub out a water bottle or thermos easily. Which is what I bought it for. It still works, but I have to grip the handle in a way where the rim scrapes my knuckles when I wash dishes. It cleans, but it's not comfortable."
1,"Surfing rocks, this game blows toads","Surfing in this game is fun and quasi-realistic...except for having to rescue dolphins, scare birds, and fight off sharks every five minutes. Which all surfers do on a regular basis, right? This game blows toads. Imagine a football game where in addition to actually playing the game, you had to micromanage the popcorn sales so you could afford new helmets.Also, there's only one beach! At least until you score enough dolphin saves, bird scares, shark beatings in the career mode. JUST LET ME SURF FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! Did these guys even PLAY this monstrosity before putting it on the shelves??? If they're not all on welfare after putting this out (they should be), I hope they do a new version where YOU ONLY HAVE TO SURF!"
2,Just a repackage of....,"Cooper's ""setups"" as presented in this book are really just a repackaging of various chart patterns. I believe the reader would be far better served by understanding why these setups work (when they do) rather than what they are specifically; an examination that the author chooses not to provide (after all, what do you want for 100 bucks??)Bulkowski's book on chart patterns & Prechter's book on Elliot waves will give you a far better understanding of the market than any of the Cooper books. In fact, with an understanding of Elliot all of these patterns or setups become remarkably clear, to the point where you shouldn't need this book in the first place"
5,Money Maker from the get-go,I started using this book after reading it and my first trade paid for 15 copies. Jeff Cooper makes day trading EASIER by revealing some interesting patterns to look for. I find 2-5 trades daily that I can see just looking at the daily list of highs and lows. I do not enter all of these trades because other technical analysis methods of review keep me out if the stock does not do what was hoped for to enter the trade.THe trades which I did get into were successful and were in stocks I would never think of following. Coopers warnings about when to enter and when to get out are valuable. I just bought another for my friend.
5,A table book,"Fantastic. Period.Boosted my earnings 200%. Needs some minor tweaks because of increased volatility of markets today, but the rest works as a charm."
2,Psychedelic South,"With a southern-fried-mushroom-tinged version of Dylan's Subterranean Homesick Blues, High Treason meshes southern sixties rock with mild psychedelia nicely. Only two stars as it is too mild for me (not enough fuzz guitar), but if you prefer Jefferson Airplane era psych with female vocals and a pleasant mix of organs and guitars then High Treason is your style. Listen first, then buy.Check out Gear Fab Records fro more great psych CD's."
4,Himmler and What He Was...,The SS of Hitler was anything but a party of fraternity brothers. It was an army of murderers. Millions died at ththe sign of the Death's Head. What it was like is in these pages. These pages that reveal a pitiful reason for murdering millions of innocents while seeking dominance and power. What a terrible shame.
4,Worth the length,"This book is long but worth the time. Thankfully, it includes a glossary for those of us who don't remember which organization is which. It isn't an easy read by any stretch. An excellent book that is good if you are planning on reading more on Nazi Germany; especially the Holocaust or Himmler's negotiations with the Western Allies, etc."
1,Propoganda,"This book is yet another which makes no distinction between the various divisions of the Schutzstaffel. This book confuses the Waffen-SS and the SS-Totenkopfverbände (Death's Head), two different groups. Proving the author has some unknown agenda, he does not discuss the pan-European nature of the SS. Even the British Freikorps are not discussed (English Waffen-SS volunteers). Also, for the record the Death's Head is not some sick satanic sign, it was a traditional memorial symbol originally used at the funeral for Freidrick the Great the first king of a united Germany.Most sadly however, the tremendous bravery of the Waffen-SS in the final few months of the war is not mentioned anywhere in this book. Without the SS, it is quite certain the Soviet armies would have reached Paris long before the Allies."
2,only thing good about this was the shipping,"i got the product earlier than expected, since i live in germany it takes around 10 days to get anything, but i got it in 7 which is good. I installed the radiator and about 5-7 minutes after filling it up with coolant and starting the car, the damn thing starts leaking on me. at first i thought it might be a hose loose for some reason, but when i looked under the car i found that it was coming from around the radiator itself. im on a crunch to get this fixed so i can't return the product. Just hope a radiator shop can repair it"
3,ok,shines nice light weight but the bottom is very thin. would think the thickness at the top would be all the way around the band
2,Not What I Expected,"The ring was too shiny and unappealing to me, upon opening the box, I knew that it just wasn't what I wanted, I gave it away to a family member."
1,cheap,item was very cute but in only one month time gems started falling out i would have just put my money towards a official ring if i knew this was going to happen !!!!!!!!!!!
1,At first glance,"At first glance this ring looks like no other. Ever since then, however, it has been nothing but a horrible mess. The tarnish free has tarnished! All of the stones lose their shine! Everything gets caught in the inside of the ring because it is practically hollow. If it even skims something it scratches. All in all nothing but a piece of junk!"
5,not so sure??,"man..i went on SO Many different sites trying to find the perfect ring for me and my boyfriend's anniversary present. I was so close to getting a ring from limoges.com for him, but i decided that the ring wasn't ""SPECIAL"" enough. I didn't receive it yet, but i hope that he'll love it..because I loved it, and fell in love with it first sight...and if you have similar taste as me, you could get the http://www.amazon.com/Simulated-Diamond-Twin-Band-Silver/dp/B000B4TDBW/ref=sr_1_51?ie=UTF8&s;=jewelry&qid;=1196044465&sr;=1-51BUT FOR FEMALES!!---^ yes, now my only concerns is that i PRAY the ring will fit, and the ""fragileness"" of it as said by the other customers."
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this ring for my boyfriend. It wasn't wide enough to look masculine unless your man has small, feminime hands. I will be returning this ring."
4,Its ok,"It is ok, nothing special, You get what you pay for. It is too small for my husband so I wanted to exchange it and made several calls and e-mails but never got a response so I just gave up. So I am hoping my husband can have it enlarged. So not real happy right now. Angela"
5,Gorgeous ring!,My husband did not think it was too feminine. Perfect fit - and arrived the day we married in the cutest little box. Very shiny and sparkly - looks completely real.
4,Nice,My husband gets compliments all the time. He beats his rings to death!! For the price I could careless lol!!
5,Blown away!!!!,"I wish I could have rated it 10 stars! I received this ring about 3 days after I ordered it! That impressed me first. Then, I opened it and I was just speechless! My husband had been without a ring for so long and we just hadn't had the money to buy him a ring. I was so pleased with what I received. The picture does it absolutely nooooo justice! And my husband just smiles everytime he looks at it. It was suppose to be a Christmas gift for my husband, needless to say I didn't wait, I was too excited! He loves it! And I do too!"
1,Its very feminine.,"It looks like a ring for a man when you look at the picture online, but in real life its a very feminine looking ring."
3,DECENT BUY,Nice looking ring for the decent price; not aware of how it happened but the ring bent after some time.
4,"nice ring, but could have been great","Like the other reviews, i agree the material is soft, but it is a nice looking ring. I am very pleased with the order, but i wish the band width was the same all the way around the ring. It is about half the size in the back. I guess some people might really like this feature, but for me...not so much. You still can't go wrong on the price!!"
3,Impressive,"Lo-fi DARKTHRONE worship is the order of the day here for this one-man black metal project (from the US), but it's occasionally woven through with melodic leads and solos, a la TIAMAT or PINK FLOYD, and even a touch of AGALLOCH acoustics here and there. Next time though, less dark ambient soundscapes, especially since they're all more or less interchangeable."
5,An exceptional journey,This is an exceptional book. Peters weaves several mysterious plot threads together in a dazzling climax.
5,A truly wonderful audiobook production.,"Ellis Peters' Pilgrim Of Hate provides the tenth chronicle of Brother Cadfael, an 1100s investigator/monk. Stephen Thorne brings to life the vivid story of the monk's investigation of a medieval celebration's setting of murder. A truly wonderful audiobook production."
3,Great 12th century detective action,"This is the second or third Cadfael novel that I've read and it makes me wonder why I don't read more of them. The series centers around a Benedictine monk in 12 th century England with the civil war between Empress Maud and King Stephen (both grandchildren of William the Conqueror). I don't much care for contemporary mysteries but I enjoy historical ones (Caleb Carr's 'The Alienist', for example). And in addition to being good mysteries Peters' books are well-written. Like so many of the really good authors, she has a gift for metaphor and that is what puts the poetry in her prose. The books also educate the readers about life during this time and the history of 12th century England."
4,Beware of Spoilers!,"This installment of the Chronicles of Brother Cadfael-the tenth of twenty-- should bear a Spoiler Alert. The first chapter summarizes the plot of A Morbid Taste for Bones (the second in the series) and a later chapter discusses a secret revealed in The Virgin in the Ice (sixth in the series). While each of the Brother Cadfael mysteries can stand alone, it is a good idea to read them in order. The reader who does so will welcome the reappearance here of some of the characters met in earlier volumes, including the elusive Olivier de Bretagne, and will appreciate this volume's variations on earlier themes. The murder that drives the plot takes place not at Shrewsbury Abbey, but many miles away, at the king's court, and of course is ultimately intertwined with the varied destinies of a group of pilgrims who come to the abbey to celebrate a saint's day and pursue their own demons."
4,Another medieval who-done-it,"I thought I had tired of Cadfael, but the book suddenly sat there on a shelf - the only new book that seemed to call my name, so I tried, and she did it again. The storyline is close to the rest of the books in the series, a combination of a mystey and a lovestorey. This time with a surprising conclusion. Resume: there is (as usual) a fair near the convent, pilgrims come to the fair because the saint (from Morbid taste for bones)is beeing moved to her permanet resting place. Among the pilgrims a pair of men travelling together, one a pilgrim the other his companion and a small family consisting of brother, sister and aunt. These five plus Cadfael are the main charecters. We get a miracle, some political intrigue, a small love story and a murder all in a readable prose. It is well worth the time and money."
2,Dissatified with microphone,"When listening to the recording of a recent meeting, our transcriptionist indicated that she couldn't hear someone speaking that was only 6ft away from the recording device. We need a microphone that will pickup voices from around a large room."
4,Loved it,I purchased three of the Wicked Witch legs for my daughters for Christmas. We were very pleased with the size and quality.
3,Unique Little Gift,"Even though it is described as a door stop, the recipient of the gift is using it as a paperweight, which is a great conversation piece. The reason I would also use it as a paperweight is that due to the quality or makeup of the piece, it will chip and crack the glaze on the piece. Otherwise, I would recommend this unusual and conversational piece."
5,too cute,awesome quality on this product. Great gift for anyone who loves the wizard of oz. very awesomly subtle decoration detail
1,Speed of service SO SLOW ordered April 27th still have not received as iof May 9th!,Can not rate this product because I haven't received it. I can only rate speed of service .... Zero stars!!!!
3,Cute piece of whimsy,Cute doorstop. However it is very small. It hasn't been used for stopping the door from slamming yet (winter). I'm not sure that it would be able to do the job. It is well made and darling to look at. It is more of a figurine type. It is REALLY small and lightweight for a doorstop. I wish it were 3x larger!
1,Excellent,"This door stop works great. It's heavy and secures doors well, and I get lots of compliments on it. Everyone loves it."
2,Better as a book end,They are cute but not functional. Probably should have read the demensions first. It is not a doorstop in that way. Could be used as a small bookend though.
2,Too Small and doesn't fit under door well at all,"The item is very cute and seems like a good concept. The problem is with the execution. The photo showing the angled feet under the door is very misleading. I tried the doorstop on several of my doors (wood floors, tile floor in bathroom, and kitchen floor) and the door stop only went one-inch at best under the door thus sticking out way too much making it more of a hinderance than a help. Also, as many have commented, this is very small. Too small. This, for me, is a total bust and I am returning it."
4,"It's a doorstop, people!","First of all, I'd like to address everyone else's reviews about how small the item is. It's a doorstop, people! How big do you want it to be? It's supposed to be small and tapered, so it will go under a door without creating a tripping hazard. Besides, they put the dimensions in the description. If you can't pull out a ruler and see how big 3"" x 4.25"" is, you shouldn't be surprised at its size, and you certainly shouldn't blame them.Now, the item itself. It is a great doorstop. It's perfectly sized for the job, and nice and heavy. The only issue I have with it (which is why I didn't give it five stars), is that the paint doesn't adhere very well to the doorstop. If you scuff it on the bottom of the door, the paint will chip off a little. I'm letting that go, though, because the chipping doesn't show when it's under the door."
1,this is NOT a doorstop,"Seriously, this thing is waaaay too small. It won't hold any of my doors. It's got felt padding on the bottom that just makes it slide as the door moves. When it's on the floor, it is so small, you can't tell what it is until you bend over to get closer. Why would a decorative door stop be so small you can't really see it. This is a table top ornament. Even the box does not mention anything about door stops. I'll be trying to return it and buy an actual realistically sized door stop that is the size to actually be a door stop. Yes, I know the size is in the description and I can believe I didn't see that it is soooo small but I really only went by the product title, which is extremely misleading. It is cute but waaaaaaaay too small."
2,Picture deceiving,The pictures made me think that it would be much larger. It is about 4 inches by 4 inches. People don't even notice it on the floor. It's cute but way overprice for the size.
3,Wicked Witch doorstop,"Very cute, colors are great. Very heavy, so it's great for holding doors. The only problem is that it is much smaller than I expected. The photo's don't give any kind of scale."
5,Produces Lots of Smiles,This doorstop is cast iron so it has good weight for its size. I was expecting it to be bigger but the size makes sense for what it is. It is 100% functional which is important and it creates lots of smiles. When not using it as a doorstop we keep the shoes sticking out from beneath the TV stand so it still gets the same effect. This would also make a nice fish tank decoration if you're really into the wizard of oz.
4,Fun for the film fan,"I bought this as a gift for my teenage daughter. She opened it and I said, ""Do you know what it is?"" and she said ""No"". ""It's a doorstop. Here, put it under your door."" She did so and it holds it open very well (especially for when her boyfriend visits, haha). Yes, it is small but it does the job. The only issue I had with it is that the red of the slippers is very, very dark red, like a burgandy red. If you remember from the film the slippers were a bright red. Dorothy taps them several times in the film. So if the makers saw the film they should have known this and used a brighter red color. But my daughter was pleased with the gift."
4,Wizard of Oz door stopper,"This is the cutest darn door stopper! I've never seen such a fun door stopper, thought it was the perfect gift for my Mother who has everything... Can't wait to give it to her! My only negative thought... it's a little small - but it's adorable."
2,Dreck,"Back in the day I loved sci fi and read many authors of the 50s and 60s. I didn't remember anything by Henry Harrison and decided to relive my youth by trying out this novel. A mistake. It was ghastly; simplistic, shallow, superficial. I chucked it about half way through."
3,Memorable Images,"It's hard for me to review the language of this book, since I actually read it in Esperanto rather than the original English (""La Kaptita Universo""). There are, however, many images from this book that will stick in your head. The vultures eating a man-sized piece of meat, the Aztec human sacrifice, and the main character ""walking on the sky."" Some of the science is dubiable, at best, and parts of the ""Konceptisto's"" (English:Conceptualist? Visionary? I don't know what term the original used) vision are hard to fit in with human nature. The plot is average for science fiction. The visual imagery, however, is worth the trip"
1,Mantra of Joy,"I bought this cd because I had heard a sample of the vocal called Mantra of Joy. I would have been very happy if the entire cd played this version of the mantra from beginning to end. Unfortunately the other selections/interpretations of Ohm Tara were absolutely awful. I love the beauty and timelessness of ancient invocational and sacred music. Why folks ruin the spiritual effectiveness of that music by putting a contemporary flair to it is beyond me, but they should so state that in their marketing so buyers are not expecting something else."
1,MADE IN CHINA,This item is not a true Portmeirion product in that it is not made in England. It is made in China. It is thin and lightweight by the standards of Portmeirion and certainly does not meet the standards of those who appreciate Portmeirion. The price seemed to be too good to be true and it was. Very dissapointing.
5,very funny,"Hilarious. Very funny and irreverent movie.Rented it first then bought a copy. Brendan gleeson deserves an award ,he is brilliant."
4,Dark and Funny,"Very good movie, slow at times, but the punchlines is where they keep you watching. Would only recommend this movie if you are a fan of dark comedy."
5,A brilliant film,"This film is one you may not have heard of, it had a limited release and was shown in many smaller, lesser known theatres. Brendan Gleeson is f@#ing brilliant and Don Cheadle plays the straight man, and they make an incredible team. A truly great film."
4,Has longevity,"The kind of film you would gladly revisit after a few years , especially enjoyed the script , it was well-crafted."
5,"Cunning, and Clever!","I wasnt really knowing what i was to expect from these two characters when i rented this movie, but all in all i had a great time watching it, even though there were some racy parts, it really made some comical plot points. The story was pretty well though out, giving you(at times) a wonder of whats really going on, or whats going to happen, in the movie.Im usualy into thrillers, comedys, and action movies, this one is kind of slow, but give it a chance for 2.99$, i was impressed!"
5,The Guard Review,"Being a retired police officer I really enjoyed this movie which I rate as the best cop flick of the year. Gleeson is superb as an old timer who does things his way. The barbs he trades with Cheadles character are priceless and had me LMAO. Watching this movie with some retired LE friends, they all loved it and highly recommend it to others. This is one of those sleeper foreign films that should have had wider release here in the US. A dark comedy showing that police work is the same no matter what country you're in. Great movie, I bought several as Christmas gifts for friends it was so good."
5,THE GUARD,"Simply brilliant in the Doctor Strangelovian manner. It destroys the concept of cultural relativity in a few spoken words. Harsh and indifferent in its tone. It is a very anti hollywood politically correct in that ""in bruges"" genre. Rebellion in writing is still alive. Enjoy the film."
5,The Guard is an excellent movie!,I have watched this movie three times and i still find it to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! Love it!
4,"Smart, funny movie","A very smart movie playing with perceptions of intellect and expectations of cinematic convention which are gently, humorously, and relentlessly undermined. The characters are credible, even the odd ones, and when violence does ensue it is solidly based in reality."
2,The What,"Maybe because my vision is a little hazy or I don't see perfect 20/20 yet really could not tell what I was watching. The title made no sense, I never laughed, could not understand what was going on, and got lost since the title description did not really happen in the film. If you pass on this movie, don't feel bad since you probably saved yourself 90 minutes you would want back.Peter J. Miller"
2,Disappointment,What can I say about this movie that the review title doesn't already say? It was not funny save for a few scant moments. Some reviewers that liked the movie said that you have to understand the Irish sense of humor to like it. Well I'm officially ignorant to their sense of humor because this movie wasn't funny at all. Save yourself the time and money. Don't watch it.
1,BIG Disappointment,"The word ""comedy"" should appear somewhere in the title and description of this film. The film's description is very misleading, and for those of us who aren't into cop comedies, very disappointing. One of the worst films I have seen in a long time. How the heck did it get a 4 star rating??? Thank you to AMAZON Customer Service for the refund! GREAT customer service from AMAZON; they really have it down."
1,This movie sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie has no black comedy...that's if you consider making fun of blacks comical!!!!!!! Bunch of people talking and no action. Movie lags disturbingly......the previous reviews must have been from the producers trying to boost this dumb, cheesy,crap of a movie!!!!!!!!!!"
1,F Bomb,"Only the artsy people would give this five stars, or maybe the Irish (it's an Irish film.)If I am too ""American"" to enjoy this, so be it. I don't mind the well-placed F word for emphasis, but the F word was part of every other statement (they left them out of the captions.) Yeah, I know, I have heard that it's a meaningless word in other parts of the world, but I am here, not there.Guess I don't like movies about bully, corrupt cops much, and since the main character was unlikeablely so, we stopped watching after fifteen minutes. Maybe it did get better, but if a book or movie hasn't grabbed my interest in the first fifteen, forget it!"
1,Worst ever!,"This movie had no trailer to watch and I understand why, after renting the movie. This was the dumbest movie I have ever seen. It belongs in the toilet!"
5,Art,"Very refreshing to say the least. It is not often that I compliment movies of any kind. I am not anyone. Other then a fellow artist. That enjoys others that do good work.That inspires values in people.I believe what this movie supports this.I have been writing about this subject.How rare it is.What has been forgotten in people today. An inner strength with a sense for what is smart and brave. A much better story then the ""The Boondock Saints"". Because it is not all flowered up. With a butch of movie made up 'junky like' highs. That people are so used too. So then. A much more mature story. Believable story.To create a movie like this.Without it being too depressing.Is why it is so good.Not only is the movie about the weaknesses of people.It defies those weaknesses.With some scruples."
5,great acting,"Solid dark humor. All in good measure: some violence (not too much), some leg (very little), lots of dirty language with heavy Irish accent to help broaden one's horizons...The story is a standard cops-vs-drug-dealers story. The script around it is very funny in a dark sort of way.The actors are excellent and the whole experience just totals in great entertainment.I was supposed to return it tonight to those rental machines but guess what, we decided to watch it one more time. It is just a lot of fun."
2,Training the Companion Dog 1 by Dr. Ian Dunbar Video,"I don't feel this video warrants the $25.00 cost, although I think highly of Dr. Dunbar's work and recommend his training methods. I think you could get this same information without spending the $25.00 plus shipping costs, since the video shows a very limited amount of training material."
5,It was a Hit,Stewie was a gift for my grandson for X-Mas. Santa has nothing on MIMI! He said it was his favorite present of all!
1,Stewie Doll,"I purchased this doll to use as part of a Halloween costume but the trick was on me! The doll came in a filthy plastic bag, inside that bag the doll was in a crushed box. The battery and voice box is located on the top part of the back of the head, not concealed at all. You close it using velcro and it does not lay flat at all. When I touched the battery pack to remove the protective shield for the batteries, the label on it fell off because glue was dried out. I removed the protective shield and squeezed the hand, like it says to do to hear him speak and it did not work....I thought the battery was dead so I replaced it with another battery (a watch type battery), but found out later from the woman I made this costume for, that you had to squeeze the foot to hear him speak.I would NOT buy from this company again. It was a cheap Chinese toy."
3,Stewie talking doll,"Batteries were dead on arrival, so that added $10 to the cost.At least in my Stewie, the sound trigger was in the foot, not in the hand as shown on the box. Not a problem that it's there, but I almost pulled the wires out trying to determine why it wouldn't work."
2,Didn't work,"It came, I opened it..NOTHING. It toy itself looked good, bigger than I thought and although the package it is attached to was damaged. The outer package was fine. The toy says 'Try Me' like in the stores. When that didn't work I went to follow the instructions to pull the tab of the battery pack, but NO TAB. So I'm returning it."
1,Poor Quality,"As most of you will realize... this is not a toy for any child. The language is not appropiate. I found this ""toy"" o be very disappointing as it is very hard to understand what he is saying. for the price... the quality is ar below my expactations."
5,The perfect travelling companion,"This wonderful guide book is crammed with pertinent information, helpful as well as lovely photographs, detailed maps and valuable suggestions. Refering to it constantly while we explored Venice enabled us to gain a deeper understanding of this enchanting city and somehow with all this the book is remarkably light weight. I plan to buy only Eyewitness Travel Guides in the future!"
5,The Best Book Written on the Subject,"This is the best book written on Radar Analysis and Design. What realy makes this book special is that it presents the subject in an easy to follow way. Additionally, the MATLAB routines provided with this book makes it really unique and very useful. Add to all that the end of chapter problems and you have the an execllent reference. I give it five stars all the way."
3,mixed emotions,"As a solo artist, she goes down the road of pop. Not my cup of tea but her collaborations with Johnny Marr definitely are good. She was never daring by herself as she was in picking(or being picked) those she did backup vocals for. The songs are enjoyable but get sappy rather quickly in tone if not lyrics. The latter is where you see a maverick side."
3,"Good, but not as good as Julie and Romeo","I just finsished reading Step-Ball Change. I couldn't wait for it to come out in paperback since I loved Julie and Romeo so much. The story was good, funny, entertaining. The relationship between Caroline and her sister Taffy was typical of two siblings....it had it's moments. It was nice to see that even though they were so different all theirs lives, in their later years became so close. It had the families intertwined as did ""Julie and Romeo"". But I felt there was something missing. I also was not thrilled with the inter-racial relationship of Caroline's son George and the Contractor's ""Woodrow's"" daughter Erica. As was Woodrow himself, not eactly thrilled but was accepting because he knew the whole family well and respected them.The story on a whole was good and a fast read. But those of you who loved Julie and Romeo (her first book)as much as I did, might be a little dissapointed in Step-Ball Change. I'm still looking forward to her next book."
3,Step-Ball-Change,This was another light reading and I enjoyed it. I have read better. I probably will read more of Ray's work.
3,Step-Ball-Change,"An entertaining little story, she does well with character development. I just finished Calling Invisible Women by the same author and much preferred that, a bit more story line to it. Will definitely read more of her books."
2,boring!,"very trite book with predictable plotline, too much like Eat Cake in form. Author presents conflict, varying family members come and go, main character is overwhelmed, then learns to cope. end of story. better authors are out there. don't waste your time."
4,Dancing sisters,"Parents of toddlers think they have the toughest job. It's a busy time but it is possible to feel like you are in charge. Jeanne Ray's book illustrates that parents of adult children have it just as tough, big problems but no control over how the problems are solved.The characters in this book, especially Woodrow, are warm, wise and loving. They felt very real to me. I enjoyed reading the dialogue as the family ties grew and bent to adapt to changing situations. The scene of the dancing sisters will stick in my mind for a long time."
5,True Wisdom,"The wisdom and knowledge of the Hebrew alphabet contained in this amazing book is outstanding! I never realized how much meaning could be derived from this simple but complex alphabet. I've gained such a deeper appreciation and closeness to God's Word by learing and and understanding the symbolism of each stroke of the Hebrew alphabet. If you want a special blessing in knowing more about the Word of God, you need to get this very inspirational learning tool."
4,Good.,I ejoyed trying to read this. I am just learning Hebrew and this is a little over my head. Otherwise very informative.
5,The Wisdom in the Hebrew Alphabet,"For anyone interested in learning the Hebrew language, especially for the purpose of learning to read the Scriptures in Hebrew, this book is an absolute treasure.Its Wisdom enlightens the receptive student and gives a taste of the depths of meaning within each Sacred Letter.""Wisdom in the Hebrew Alphabet"" has proved to be a very worthwhile addition to my own personal library, and a book to which I often turn.I would happily recommend it to anyone at all seeking to widen their understanding of the Holy Bible."
5,Precious Knowledge,This is not an easy read because it is a so wonderfully written. The explanations and ideas are arresting so much so that one wants to soak in each page. Highly recommended.
4,very insightful,I was so impressed with this book I would wake up in the middle of the night and want to read more sections of it. It has given me a strong desire to learn more about the Hebrew alphabet and what relevance it has in understanding the nature of the true Master of the Universe!
5,Gleaning the Hebrew Aleph-Beis,"The Wisdom in the Hebrew Alphabet, published by Artscroll, is a treasure trove of interesting & helpful insights related to the walk of Faith, whether Jewish or Christian. As I absorbed the authors insights & found them resonating with other insights I have gleaned from the Scriptures & Bibliacl numerology, I was pleased to have obtained it. Great book!L Greene"
5,Inspirational and well written,"As I read this book, I can sense the passion behind the author and know that it wasn't just thrown together but has countless years of thought and preparation behind it. It is extremely well written and full of Wisdom and Understanding. What I also enjoy is how clear it is to read and inspires me to read it over and over again. This book is well worth every penny that I spent on it and more. If you desire to grow in Judaism, buy it - you won't regret it."
4,The Wisdom of the Hebrew Alphabet,Very exciting book full of details that help non-Jews understand the Tora writting.I recomand the book to anyone wanting a fuller understanding of the old testament.
2,I didn't like this product at all,The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made. You can't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that doesn't sit well. It's basically useless and doesn't look good at all. I would certainly not recommend this product.
4,Not quite 30x30,"I ordered seven of the 30x30 scarves. Not one of them was 30x30. I measured each one. I had everything from 29x29, 29.75x30 to 29.75x29.75 so I am glad I went with the larger scarf. One scarf had a hole in it but I did not notice it until I went to use it. It is small but I was past the exchange date when I found it so I have one scarf with a small hole. The scarves are soft, shiny and very comfortable. I highly recommend going over the scarf more carefully upon arrival than I did so you can take advantage of the exchange policy if needed."
4,Clapton in the 80's,"This a great video to see Eric, Phil Collins, Nathan East, and Greg at a concert in England in 1986. The only thing I see wrong is in the song ""Run"" the sound of the Eric's guitar does not match the video. You hear a guitar playing in the middle or near the end of the song but Eric's picking hand is not moving. I guess they could have been using tape loops. This is still a good way to see Eric and band in the eighties."
1,Disappointingly shallow,"While the songs on this CD can honestly be called harsh in their depictions of reality, they fall far short of fairytale stature in their repeated lack of resolution. This seems more an album meant to justify the hardness of being a man rather than offering insights into nature of this hardness. The singer's voice seems strained on some of the songs, but the listener is unable to tell whether this is from emotion or from vocal limits."
5,extremely well done!,This was such a clever format for a story! The book began in the 1700's and each chapter was about a family or person who lived there in each following generation. The focus was on a life altering moment in their life. Some characters reappeared in the next chapter as an older version of how they appeared in the preceeding chapter. A very interesting perspective on how lifestyles evolved in the coastal community of Cape Cod over the centuries! Excellent!
5,This is the ideal novel for any avid reader.,This is my favorite Alice Hoffman novel. When ever I think upon it I am haunted by her magical realism and that house on the Cape. I loved how she spanned all of American History by using a house to build a story around. This novel has so much depth and offers so much pleasure with its finely drafted prose. This is the ideal novel for any avid reader.
3,not her best work,"I usually am a huge fan of Alice Hoffman. Her writing is beautiful and I love the way she makes the most seemingly mundane things magical. However, this book left me very disappointed. The disjointed story lines left all but a few characters destinies uncertain. Why invest yourself in a story if you don't find out what happens? The fact that all these characters lived in or near blackbird house seems like a charming idea, but the followthrough isn't very satisfying. I wish she had instead chosen a few characters at a specific time and delved deeply into their lives. If you are unfamiliar with Alice Hoffman's work don't start off with this mediocre work, try Here On Earth or Practical Magic."
4,sad but powerful,"I was in the mood for a short story collection for a change, so I picked this one up. These tales are all set in the same place, a farm in Cape Cod. I especially liked ""the Witch of Truro"" and the stories centered around Violet. These stories are often strange and depressing, yet the writing style has some original and beautiful devices. And there is an underlying quality in some of the stories that moved my heart's sympathy.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
1,Ummm,"I was very excited about this. I've loved the author's books for years, but this is hands-down the worst of them I've read. It is without any direction or intrigue- obvious and unimaginative, and badly put together. I was dissapointed with Alice Hoffman. I could barely believe she worte it after The River King, The Probable Future, and Second Nature, a few of my favorites. Please get them instead, you'll be very happy. I really don't know why this book got so many stars from so many readers. I guess stories are easier to read, but they are really not worth it even so. Besides J.K. Rowling, it's hard to think of an author who writes books easier to get through."
4,Keeping it simple,"I am more of a movie buff, but have recently been spending alot more time reading. I couldn't have found a better book to keep me wanting more.My favorite concept of The Blackbird House was all the short stories and how each one of them intersected. My only regret was not reading it with a book club. I passed it along to my sister and she can't read it fast enough for me. It was just long enough that I may have to read it again to find details that I missed. This was my first book of Alice Hoffman's and I will surely be reading more."
3,Not a new book,When I received this book the first thing I noticed was that the dust cover had been glued to the book. While this was odd it wasn't until I started reading the book that I realized that it was not a new book (which I thought I was buying) but a used book. At the end of the first chapter the page was dog-eared--as if someone had turned it as a bookmark. So I rifled through the book and came upon more turned pages--but the coup-de-gras was on page 52--what appears to be spaghetti sauce smeared on the page! Although over all the book is in excellent shape--it is not a new book--it is pre-read and should have been sold as such.
3,Blackbird House,"I'm a big fan of Alice Hoffman's work, her book The Ice Queen is one of my favorites. I really had no idea what this book was about. After reading it I have some mixed thoughts on it. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. It didn't grab me, I found I had to push myself to read it and finish it.The book is a collection of short stories based on people who lived in a farmhouse in Cape Cod called Blackbird House. The stories vary from different times and events. From a mother whose sons and husband are lost at sea, to a woman who loses the man she loves to her more beautiful sister, to a pair of brothers whose only wish is to leave the small town and move on to better things. The stories are all intertwined in some way. The writing was wonderful as usual Alice Hoffman style."
5,Intricately woven tale...LOVED IT!,"Once again, Alice Hoffman writes an amazing novel (I hesitate to call it a novel much like other reviewers since it is a collection of stories, but it is seamless nonetheless). I enjoy her use of color throughout these stories - this seems to be a reoccurring style with Hoffman - it truly adds to the brilliance of each individual tale. Highly recommend - a relatively quick read for those on the go - best part is how rewarding it is!"
2,This one is for the birds!,"I have read several other works of fiction by Ms. Hoffman and enjoyed them. However, I was disappointed in the ""cobbled together"" collection found under the title: BlACKBIRD HOUSE. Magical realism can be very enjoyable but it requires some actual ""meat on the bones"" to sustain it. Hoffman usually has a deft touch with this suspension of reality but these tales seemed to be little more than fragmented ideas for longer, more fully-realized stories that she just couldn't flesh out. The house as central theme drew me in (as I am always most attracted to old houses with rich histories that can captivate the imagination).This so-called novel barely skimmed the surface and left me feeling cheated...I wanted something more substantive. Hungry for a loaf of bread I found only breadcrumbs, instead.Alice, I know you can do better.Ms. Denise in Virginia"
2,Bland and tasteless,"This may well be the worst space marines novel i've read todate. The characters were as i stated, absolutely bland.The way they were depicted, they might as well havebeen the machines the ironhands aspire to become.The novel felt more like a script goingfrom one story point to another before it hits a storyclimax where you feel relieved since the novel isfinally over. Other characteristics of the novelweren't all that bad but when you feel nothing for themain character, you'll feel either numbness or disliketowards the entire novel.On another note, sometimes supporting characters are thereto take over and support the lead character. Sad to say,the supporting characters have either the same or evenless character than Ironfather Godkin.2 Stars. I would have rated it 1 star but i couldn't saythat i actually hated this novel"
2,This is one of those I'll donate to the local library..,"..And hope they don't take my library card away for it..I agree with all of the reviews here--This one is boring and a chore to read..The main character is shallow and angry at everything all of the time..And the so called twists in the plot are tedious and seem to be written with a decided effort to frustrate the reader to the point of tossing the book away..Sorry, I'm a huge fan of Warhammer,but this one really did kind of suck..Want to see something funny? Go read the reviews over at Black Library..There's enough sugar coating and sycophantic praise there to make you sick..I wonder how much the reviewers there got paid for what they wrote?"
2,Disappointing,"I thought Green's 'Crusade for Armageddon' was a pretty good book but I had to force myself to finish 'Iron Hands'. The writing is just repetitive, tiring, and full of fluff. If I had to read 'black ichor' one more time I was going to scream. The story is un-interesting and the characters not only shallow but also not likable. Granted the universe of WH40K is fiction but Green makes the world completely unbelievable in this story.The one good thing about the book is Green does a nice job of describing both ground and space actions. Fans of BFG will find some interesting sections.If you like WH40K go read Abnett's books."
4,First Read,"This book was my first exposure to Warhammer 40k. I didnt know it existed till I picked this book up from a pile in Iraq. I thougth it was great, kinda shallow and predictable, but what can you expect from books based off of a game? Anyhoo, I thought it was very entertaining."
5,"Good size, easy to read","This is a fantastic watch for sporty women or smaller men who don't like the petite, feminine, jewelry-watch look. The face is big enough to easily read the date as well. Great price too!"
2,Hard Times,I never purchased this book. I may have previewed it but it is not on my kindle or in my archive please check in to thisKindest RegardsGary
2,Disappointment in quality,"I ordered this book new from Amazon along with all the other books I needed for my semester. All the other books came in brand new, but this one was incredibly damaged. It was obviously shipped damaged because the package was not damaged and none of the other books were. I would have sent the book back but I need it for class in a few days and wouldn't have time to send it back and receive a new one. Below is a link to a few pictures I took of the damaged book. I am very disappointed.http://imgur.com/a/7f2fe"
3,Disappointed,"I really enjoyed Studs Terkel's The Good War, which won a Pulitzer Prize. I found this book not nearly as attention-holding. One wonders how bad the interviews that did not make the book were, in view of the ""badness"" of a few that did make the book. At least one of the interviewees sounded like a candidate for a mental institution, yet his words, complete with obscenities spelled out, were in the book. Some of the interviews, with well-known folk, like Jim Farley and others had interest."
4,True Reporting,"Hard Times is without a doubt the most impressive book that I read for any history class. Terkel allows the voice of the times to come through from many different people. It tells a tale of widespread hardship, and the community that it bred. Great book."
3,Experience of people in depression times,"A series of vignettes of people effected by the depression. A depressing read, necessary, for some but offering no analysis of the underlying causes. Consequently it depends on one's individual tastes in understanding the Great Depression."
3,A bit of nostalgia,"I lived in the town of Reading, PA, where this movie was filmed. I went to some of the scene locations during filming. Although the movie looks very outdated, the city was captured perfectly. John Updike lived near Reading (or Brewer, as it is called in his books.). This is the only movie made from the collection of Rabbit books & I think the movie expresses the true character of Rabbit, not necessarily a good character, but one that is brutally honest & self-involved, lacking good morals, & always running away from life's problems. Just the kind of main character you like to read about or see in a movie."
4,"Great book, great view",Very good book a must read for folks lost in the sea of discontent to do with Dr.'s views and all that mess.
1,Strarch=triglycerides=insulin=fat,"McDougall must be the most egocentric, pompous MD I've ever read. His diet NEVER fails, only YOU fail at it."
2,Not a durable unit.,"I bought this as a replacement for a bicycle pump that I owned and used for about 20 years. That one died finally, and I thought this Bell Windstorm with a pressure gauge would be convenient. I have had this for about 3-4 months, using it about 10 times in that period. While it was working it worked well and I appreciated the onboard pressure gauge feature. The rubber hose has now broken where it attaches to the pump and it will not inflate anything. I do not see a way I, as a consumer, can repair it. This was assembled using glue to attach the hose to the pump. I would have to send the unit to Bell post paid with the original receipt (which I no longer have) to get the unit replaced under the Bell 3 year warranty. The cost of shipping alone would be about the same as the cost of a replacement, so the warranty is pretty much worthless to me. I would not buy one of these again."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"This pump barely works. I bought it for automobile tires, but they use the same Schrader valve as many bicycle tires. The pin inside the valve is a cheap plastic piece that barely manages to push the pin in on the tire's valve, so it's hard to get a seal without removing and re-seating the valve repeatedly until the pressure gauge reads above zero. Even then, the seal is often not good, so it's very hard to pump the air. The gauge also reads on the low side, at least at car tire pressures."
3,Mislabeled Product,"This is actually the Bell Windstorm floor pump, not the Airstrike 1900. This pump has an accurate gage, at least up to 60 lbs pressure. I was unable to get it to inflate bike tires above 60 lbs. The hose is about 16"" long including the locking head, which fits Schraeder valves only. It does have a handy attachment that allows you to hang it from a nail for storage. It seems to be well made and is worth the price if you don't need to inflate bike tires over its 60 lb. limit."
1,Broke with presta adapter,Mine broke immediately when I tried to use it to inflate road bike tires (using a presta adapter).
1,Leaks Air Consistently,"The seal for the presta valve is consistently faulty. Unless you are able to position the valve in the EXACT perfect position, air will leak out at a high rate. This remedy requires you to hold the valve with one hand while pumping with the other. This is especially frustrating if you need to inflate above 60 psi because unless you're a body builder, good luck pushing down with enough force to inflate to the 120 psi the pump is rated for. I recommend you spend your money on another pump."
1,Worst Product: Overall Category,This is potentially the worst product I have ever purchased. I could more easily have inflated my road bike tires with my mouth than with this sorry excuse for a freshman engineering project. Save your money.
1,Broke After Two Uses,"I bought this unit because of the gauge and price. I used it twice and the airhose broke. Save your money, buy something more durable."
1,Don't buy this pump!,"This pump lasted a few times before the cheap plastic pump head failed, rendering the pump useless. The three year warranty requires you to send the pump in before getting any satisfaction. Will think twice about buying any products from Bell if this is where their ""quality"" control is leading."
2,"""Strike 2""","Stumbled upon this title after reading Daniel Goleman's ""Emotional Intelligence"" and ""Social Intelligence"" (both impressive reads) and being directed to another Manz title ""Emotional Discipline"".As with Manz's other title, I found myself skipping over each of his so called ""poetic"" offerings interspersed throughout. Not enough depth here to bother with.My recommendation for Manz's books ... if your curiosity moves you to ""check them out""... do it with your library card."
3,Eh,"Nothin too impressive here. Fab is a pretty good lyricist, but to me this album falls flat. You would think that this album would be his defining album like he said it would be but sittin through all the fillers is painful. Now the album has some gems and high moments, like the Bonus track this is family, a huge posse cut with rappers such as Joe Budden, Ransom, and Paul Cain, Brooklyn(feat. Jay-Z, and Uncle Murda), and what can I do feat. Lil Mo. But most of the rest of the albums are like the standard songs too any album. You have the filler ""Baby Don't Go"" feat. T-Pain, the average Gangsta's don't play with Junior Reid, and the dissapointing Jokes on You feat. Pusha T (who I expected to deliver but didn't). I say, save your money, borrow this album or bootleg it"
2,From Nothin' to Nothin',Come on bro!? This is the worst album I have ever heard from Fabolous Sport! Listing to this album makes me want to put him on Comedy Central for a Roast Session! And the Roasters should be the idiots that put him in this position for him to sell out like he did! Absolutely disgusting!
2,From nothin' to nothin',"Well just got done listening to fab's album and after a blood vessel popped in my eye I decided to write a review. The two stars I gave for the album are for the beats only. The lyrics on this album are weak and infantile. On return of the hustle fab uses Beyonce's lyrics (to the left, to the left) to describe what he does with his money. Diamonds---"" they ain't got one problem with this, square face watch look like spongebob on the wrist""?!?!?!??! Also in diamonds he dropped a K-FED line ""lotta karats but not the one's bugs bunny's snacking on"" LMAO!!!!!! This kat is weak as hell. Change up featuring akon made me feel like a rash was growing all over my body and on real playa like me he is bragging about being a metrosexual (LOL). The hook done by Ne Yo was kool but the hook with the song with Jay z on it was wack. Overall verdict, don't buy this album with your own money. Trick some one into buying it for you so it won't be a lost on your behalf."
5,Only For The Lyrically Inclined,"this CD was so full of complexity and word play it gave me goosebumps...listen to the lyrics to ""Jokes On You"". You really have to be a hip hop head in order to appreciate not only his tracks, but his lyrics...look em up, you'll see how crazy they really are if u can't hear em straight up.dope CD, dope lyrics...once again, I'm impressed."
2,Very interesting indeed,"Its really funny how everyone who rated this album over 4 stars either bought the CD based on ""Make Me Better"" alone or are under 13! Is this what mainstream hip hop has been reduced to?"
4,LOSO DOES IT AGAIN,"I would have have to say I was pretty happy with this album. Probably not his best work, but definitely worth buying. From nothing to something definitely seems like it is intended to be a bit more commercial sounding than his last album."
3,From Something To Nothing,"This CD is mad corny, theres only like 5 good songs in this... DONT BUY IT!!! DOWNLOAD THE SONG DIAMONDS IN ITUNES, OR RETURN OF THE HUSTLE...DO NOT BUY THIS CD"
4,From Nothin' To Somethin',"Definitely not his best but trust me it will grow on you. If you're a real Fab fan u will be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. The problem with this album is not a lack of features got em (Lloyd, T-Pain, Akon, Jay-Z, Ne-yo, Red Cafe, Rihanna) or hot beatz got em (Just Blaze, Swizz Beatz etc.) but a lack of hooks. Brooklyn w/ Jay-Z was especially disappointing for that reason. But The cd does have at least 7 pretty good tracks and who can deny the kid with the Grammy grin? Hope this helps. Najwa >:<"
4,DECENT ALBUM,"FAB HAS HIS SWAGGER AND IF YOU DON'T FEEL HIS STYLE YOU PROBABLY WILL GET TIRED OF THIS ONE. FOR THE MOST PART, THIS ALBUM IS LIGHT IN NATURE LIKE STREET DREAMS WHICH IS WHAT I LIKED ABOUT IT."
1,MORE POP BOP GARBAGE,"HERES ANOTHER WEAK ALBUM FOR DA POP BOP CROWD. ANYONE WHO FINDS THIS ALBUMGOOD MUST NOT LISTEN TO THE ROOTS,PHAROAH MONCH,MOS DEF OR MEGALON. ITS ALBUMS LIKE THESE THAT HIP HOP IS IN DA SHxxTER. PRE SCHOOL RHYMES LIKE""I'M FLOSSING,NOW I'M BOSSIN',WHY HAVE DA CAKE,WITHOUT THE FROSTING""-WACK!!!AND LIKE USUAL FAB CAN'T HOLD HIS OWN LIKE A MAN WITH NO ARMS..HE GOT HELPFROM THE INDUSTRY'S TOP CHART TOPPERS:JAY-Z,AKON,JEEZY-ECT. --PITIFUL"
4,Excellent down to earth from down under.,This is a very interesting book. The characters are real and down to earth- believeable. There is much anticipation for Carol from one moment to the next to get closer to solving who and why the teacher was killed.
1,Footnotes In The Middle Of A Page,It looks like this book was printed by cutting and pasting an electronic text into a book printing machine without proofreading it first. There are line breaks and footnotes all over the place where they don't belong. Anyone leafing through the first ten pages of the book would have noticed it. This book is junk.
5,Great value sturdy little toy box.,1 year old likes it and can manipulate the hinge top to empty & fill box. Very pleased with it. Also it arrived fast
3,STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE TOY BOX,"THE TOY BOX LOOKS REAL GOOD. IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE TO SCREW ALL THE WOOD SIDES TOGETHER. IT IS VERY SMALL,IT WILL ONLY HOLD A COUPLE OF SMALL TOYS. MY LITTLE DAUGHTER LOVES IT."
1,Don't bother,"I've played all the other Myst games and loved them. This game however, gave me nothing but technical headaches. Reading the system requirements gave me heartburn and I have a degree in computer science! The game crashes on my Window XP Professional system, 512MB RAM, 1.6 GB processor *and* a (supposedly) supported NVidia card. The error message it left in the application log was entirely useless, demonstrating just how terrible the programming must be on this thing. Ubisoft's technical support is non-existent."
1,This is a big disappointment!!,"I would say I'm an somewhat average game player. I have followed MYST since it first came out. It is true that after a week of adjusting and updating my computer the game itself was disappointing. The puzzles were dull by the time you did figure them out, you couldn't believe that was it and there was no storyline. At least in the first three you could immerse yourself in the story and graphics. Why make the only character besides you computerized? Save the money, try another game!"
3,Pluses equal minuses.,"Gorgeous graphics, impossible puzzles. I really don't know how they could possibly expect anyone to figure this out. The game play is on the weak side as well. When you need to perform a crucial action, it's always a jump. Almost always a dead end. I have a pretty fast computer, and the time it takes to get back to where you were is excruciating.Gameplay: Boring with a capital BGraphics: Absolutely 100% Gorgeous"
3,Make sure you have their recommended graphics adapter,"I just purchased a brand new pc - 2.5 ghz pentium 4, 512mb ram (windows xp home). After 30 minutes of install time, 1 hour of several online broadband ""updates"", and a couple hours of technical support from HP (Thanks HP!), we came to the conclusion that the software was incompatible with the graphics adapter in my new pc.Oh yeah, good luck surfing their FAQ's, etc. Technical support on their end is minimal.Final comments: Don't assume that if you have a new PC, this software will work. Make sure you have a graphics adapter such as they recommend. I have changed my review to three stars since I cannot state how well the software works because I cannot use it without an upgrade to my pc."
1,Video card clarification,"The requireemnts say the 32MB NVIDIA GeForce 2 is supported? There is more than one GeForce 2 -- MX, GTS -- are all supported? I have the NVIDIA GeForce2 MX and cannot get video even by setting everything to lowest quality display."
1,Pretty but tedious,"The game installed just fine and my PC (1.7 gHz Athlon w/GeForce 4 video) runs it without issue.The graphics are lovely and imaginative, though often so dark that I had to play the game at night with the lights off. (Yes, I went through the video calibration and I have the gamma correction at max.)But that's where the fun ends. I agree with others that puzzles are tedious and made very difficult by the interface. The previous Myst games required lots of thinking, putting clues together to solve the puzzles. This latest addition requires less thinking and more ""Mario Brothers"" type moves.I think I'm about half-way through the game and I'm tempted to stop there. I won't even consider the online version of the game (which is what I think UBISOFT and CYAN really designed this game for).If you liked the previous versions of Myst, don't bother with this one. If you don't mind half the game being ""how do I time this jump just right"", give it a try."
1,Can you give negative stars?,"This game doesn't deserve even zero stars. The 3-D controls are the worst I've ever seen. It's impossible to move around easily and like a previous reviewer said, you are now more worried about falling off ledges than solving puzzles. Also, the great mood music in earlier games in the series is now gone. It's been replaced by, well pretty much nothing. What were they thinking when they designed this clunker? I'm so p*ss*d I spent the money on this game and now it's gone for good. All they needed to do was continue the Myst-Riven-Exile format and people would have been happy as clams, but instead they went for the greed hoping people will someday pay to play this piece of crap online. Man what a bomb."
1,Feeling Ripped Off By Amazon and UBI? I am!!!!!,"Feeling ripped off? I am! I bought this game through Amazon, but first I checked the ""systems requirements"" to make sure it would run on my PC. Looked good - got game - can't install or play it because - guess what - I don't have the right video card or sound card!!!! This game doesn't work with INTEL graphics controller!!! INTEL, for $#@# sake! Can't return to Amazon because it's opened! So please, trusting consumers, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT without doing some solid research - which is what I should have done, but no...I trusted Amazon and UBI/CYAN. Big mistake. p.s. I only filled in one star up above because I had to in order to get this review posted."
1,not even my tech could get the game to play,"I bought this game pre-order 'cause I wanted the previous mysts to play on my new laptop with xp. i have 512 of ram, a NVIDIA force 4 4200 video card, an upgrade on my audigy sound card. NADA! Nil! nichevo! It installed o.k.- so it said - and went directly to my home interface. My tech tried it on his machine, nada. His wife tried it on her new custom-built machine - nada. What a piece of ka-ka!!"
4,Exellent,"THIS IS A FANTASTIC GAME!!!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT IF YOU LOVE FANTASY. IT IS A CHALLENGE, BUT A LITTLE CHALLENGE IS A GOOD THING. IT IS SO COOL THAT YOU CAN MAKE YOUR CHARACTER EITHER MALE OR FEMALE, AND THAT YOU CANE MAKE IT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE YOURSELF!!!!! THE PUZZELS YOU HAVE TO SOLVE ARE REALLY INTRESTING. IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN RIVEN BECAUSE YOU CAN CANGE YOUR VEIW AND YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF. YOU CAN ALSO COSTOMISE YOUR WARDROBE, AND EVEN YOUR SHOES. ME AND MY DAD BOTH LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!"
2,dumb,this game is boring and dumb. all you do is walk around this stupid porely designed kingdom I don't recomend it. Age of Mythology is a better myth game
1,URU: Too much hype,"This age of myst was one the really dissappointed me. Upon getting the game, it wouldnt play on my system because of the video card, so i had to buy a new card to play it. But the game itself is really boring, you spend all your time searching every inch of the screen to find things. All the other myst series had it alot easier to see when you had something to look at or click on, but not this game. If you are not in the exact right spot, you will miss something that you need to continue the game. I never finished playing URU because you are not sure what you are looking for, also you almost need a PHd to solve a few of the puzzles. This game was a big waste of my money, and i hope that they go back to the drawing board on the next installment they make. Get back to some of the old myst, newer isnt always better!"
3,URU review,"Incedible graphics, very good puzzles in one of the worlds, but not enough Myst and Riven style puzzles of pure logic, too many jumping and action puzzles. I like the avatar creation and the ability to push objects of ledges. Oh and one more thing STUPID FIREFLYES,WHY CAN'T YOU JUST GO IN A JAR OR SOMETHING, IT IS REALLY ANNOYING TO LIGHT A CAVE WITH SOMETHING THAT IS SCARED OF WATER!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,BEWARE...Only works with two types of graphic cards,"I was only able to get past the opening scene and then the game kept crashing. Unfortunately I didn't realize that there are only two types of graphic cards work this game. The system requirements were for the following graphic cards: 32 MB NVIDIA GeForce 1, 2, 3, 4, or FX; ATI Radeon 7000-9800 OR BETTER. Since my laptop is brand new I assumed my graphics card (Intel chipset) was considered the ""or better'!Oh well, I was really looking forward to playing Uru since I've played all the other Myst games. I don't understand why UBI did this. The other games were just fine."
1,Uru should be pooyou,"I bought this game for my wife, and was so ashamed to have gotten such a cheap (NOT) game. I have a top of the line computer WITH the correct video card, and the game still sucks. The graphics are terrible, and moving around takes a brain surgeon, or so it would seem. I wish that I could get my hard earned money back, but the scheisters that put out this game aren't likely to do that since their obvious modivation was profit, and not the unwary customer. I will never purchase another game crapped out be these people."
1,won't run on notebook computers,"UBI Soft is only supporting the following video cards: so buyer beware: 32MB NVIDIA GeForce 1,2,3, 4 or FX; ATI Radeon 7000-9800 or better. URU has been found to NOT run on: Radeon Mobility (the Radeon notebook chip set), NVIDIA go (the NVIDIA notebook equivalent), and the intel chip set. These 3 chip sets are used in the majority of notebook computers."
1,Uru-Ages beyond Myst,I am sure this is a game is good because the other ones were great. But since UBI Soft has decided that MAC users are not important I will never find out.
1,A stake through the heart of what was a great franchise,"Thank God Ubisoft had a playable demo that saved me from spending any money on this game. Ubisoft would be best served to return to the format of the first three games and not exclude the Mac fan base as they have here. The game ran sufficiently well on my 1 year old Dell, but, hardware requirement issues aside, the game looks and feels more like Everquest than a Myst game.A big disappointment for what was an eagerly anticipated game."
1,Unclear specifications,"Although it lists""Video Card: 32 MB NVIDIA GeForce 1, 2, 3, 4, or FX; ATI Radeon 7000-9800 or better""as the required specifications, The Geforce 2 MX series doesn't seem to be supported (from the constant crashing)."
3,I REALLY HOPE...,"that the graphic design and rendering on this is MUCH better than on MYST 3 EXILE-I nearly fell out of my seat laughing at the amatuer designs, and cartoonish look of that world.To me RIVEN set a standard, and I was hoping that 5 years of computer advancement would have created a state-of-the-art looking game, not a stylized version of LEGEND OF ZELDA."
2,ANOTHER Disappointed Myst Fan,"I loved the previous games in the Myst Series, but was disappointed with Uru. First, the story was nowhere near as compelling as in the previous games. Secondly, controlling your avatar was quite difficult - and be prepared for a lot of jumping more typical of an action game. The game seemed as if it was only a prelude to the real game to be played online. Unfortunately, Online Uru has now been cancelled. Instead we will get expansion packs; the first one free to those previously registered...."
1,Not like the others in the series.,"I bought this game for my husband for Christmas because we had so much fun with the previous games in the series. What a disappointment. The beautiful grahics and haunting music from the last ones are missing. You now go through as a character you created, worrying about jumping off ledges rather than encountering interesting puzzles to solve. Using a character to explore the worlds takes away the firsthand feeling of being in a stranger in a strange land. It is ackward and just not the same. I personally don't want to meet other gamers in cyberspace nor do I care that I can change the length of my character's nose or his shirt. I just want to be presented with fun and challenging puzzles in an exotic and mysterious place. I wish I could return it after only one night of playing."
2,Greatly Disappointed Myst Series Fan,"I've played all the Myst series games and never found any other games I liked as well, so I was eagerly anticipating URU. What a disappointment. As many people have stated, the controls are very difficult--to my mind they interfere with the exploration of the wonderful worlds, which is one of my favorite things about this series. I just don't get the sense of wonder that I got with previous games and sometimes the timed puzzles are such a pain that they really lessen the enjoyment of the game. Unlike the other games, I may not bother to finish this one. The game definitely did not live up to my expectations either in story line or graphics. Another gripe I have is that you probably won't be able to play the on-line portion particularly well unless you have broadband. Well, this game is not good enough to induce me to upgrade to broadband to play the on-line portion. A really mediocre effort from the people who produced the previous three great games."
1,Gave up trying to play after 4 hours of frustration!!!!,"It should be clearly listed on the outside of the box that this game has several incompatibility issues with the most popular video cards, we have 2 nearly new HP computers, one with Pentium III and one with Pentium 4 and plenty of RAM in both, but the NVDIA cards are incompatible with this game! I got it for Christmas and was so excited to play. Now I am asking the gift giver for the receipt back so I can go buy another compatible type game for XP."
1,Consumers be Warned,"I read the review ""feel ripped off"" I completly understand this person's anger , this happend to me with the Anniversary dvd edition of Myst/ (Riven) does not work and is a know problem with some video cards which Ubisoft knows about, while on the site i checked to see if my card would be compatiable with URU hence as the reviewer wrote it would not support it , i have Intel intergrated chipset also. I think all stores or online sites should post this info as soon as it becomes available, too many burned consumers out there."
1,Can't tell you if it's cool or not,"Recently purchased Exile (Myst III) and Uru here at Amazon, after checking computer requirements. Exile is dull, despite the cheap price, don't bother. Uru, on the other hand, is massive, and although it will load, cannot get it to run on new Dell XP machine. No on-line support from UBI that I can find - their beautiful web site is geared for those who've already gotten 'in' and are ready to move forward to cyberspace. I'm very disappointed but willing to sell to the highest bidder!"
1,no no no,"This is not the bare minimum of what Myst should be like. Never mind the crashing, this is just no fun whatsoever. It's cold and unnecessarily mysterious. Pass on this one."
1,Forgot who made them so successful,"I can't believe that this is a PC-only game, with no Mac version! The whole Myst phenomenon was launched be Mac users! The original Myst was Mac-only when it first came out and it sold an incredible number of copies. Now the Miller brothers have turned their backs on the people who made them successful in the first place."
1,Not for Macintosh?!!,What's this crap! Myst IS a Macintosh series- always has been. Now some company buys the franchise and only puts out a PeeCee version? Forget it. Myst has lost it's myth.PS: sorry I had to give a star at all.
1,Shame about UBI Soft,"Myst was and is created on Macs, and original Myst was first a Mac only title, because the Miller brothers are Mac Freaks and produced a long time for Macs only. I am shure URU will come for Mac too, but that it still isn't available for Mac, and worse that it is not first for Mac only is a break of tradition that tells us UBI Soft does not deserve to have this title."
5,URU: Ages Beyond Myst,"I am an avid player of the myst and riven, and all adventure games. I must say that URU is a game that has unbelieveable sights and sounds. The graphics and details in the scenes are phanominal. You have so much to see in not just the details of the game but also for instance, there's the building that rotates and as you wait to align the walk ways the background scene is just beautiful with the mountain and falls and valleys that you see as your revolving around with the building. The puzzles are great to try and you can also interact with things like shooting at stuff from a distance. But with all these game be aware that you should save your game as often as you can when going through puzzles and places that you don't want to repeat. I love this game and have played it 4 times and each time is just as rewarding as the first. So give it a try. I think its one of the best of the series."
3,Eh...well...,"I haven't gotten through the whole game yet, but so far, it's a bust. The most fun part is being able to change your clothes...and that's it. Everything is so complicated and if you don't jump right, walk right or look at something right, it will mess the whole game up. I would recommend not buying this game just because of the fact that it's not like the first three. It makes Ubisoft look horrible."
1,URU AGES BEYOND MYST,"I JUST FOUND THE CONTROLS IN THIS GAME TO DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.THE GAME PLAYERS, WOULD NOT MOVE WHERE YOU DIRECT THEM, AND THEARROW KEY MOVEMENT, MOVED THE PLAYERS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTIONGAME WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT, IF MOVEMENT OF PLAYERS WOULD HAVEBEEN AS IN RIVEN, MYST III EXILE, OR EVEN MYST, TRYING TO CONTROLTHE GAME PLAYERS, TOOK THE FUN AND ADVENTURE OUT OF THE GAME."
3,Upset but thrilled.,"I knew that this was not going to be a direct sequel to the Myst saga, but rather it is related. First off; this game is the most beautiful game I have ever played my entire life. The sounds are perfect, the music is perfect, the visuals are perfect. So if this game is perfect...why a 3/5? It seems to have more flaws than perfections. It's hard to explain. You have to experience the other Myst games, then this one to understand. One of the flaws is simply my opinion; it's not a Myst 4, nor is it intended to be. I knew this. But I still got this game because it's based around the other Myst games. Just a few hundred years later I believe. There's just something about the other Myst games that just grabbed my brain, my heart, and my eyes and ears...that this one just didn't quite get a hold of completely."
3,"Nice graphics, average gameplay","I was taken by the scenery and atmosphere that Uru provides, therefore making this game appealing initially. I was then frusterated by the difficult controls which create a difficult gameplay. The puzzles are not too bad, and are quite simliare to the style of the previous games. I was pleased as well as disapointed with this game. I give it 3 stars."
1,URU is not as Advertised,"I purchase this game based on my past experiences with Myst andRiven. It has a complete Single Player off line. When I triedto gain access to the Multiplayer ""URU Live, I entered my CD Keyand a window comes up saying that a 56k Modem is no good. Youhave to have high speed modems to get on line. No where does thegame state this on the box or literature. That means you have been had. I can't afford a highspeed internet and it is notavailable in my area until June 2004. I find that it will be$39.95 a month. Then you have to subscribe at Est, $9.95 a monthto play. Sorry, the game will be played in Single Mode and bedeleted from my CPU."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!,"I purchased this game with great expectations, all of the Myst type games have been very, very good. I tried to install this on my three machines (Intel 3.06 gig processor, Intel 2.6 gig processor, and AMD 2400 XP+) and could not get it to work on any of them. I understand the importance of copyguarding games, but when it won't let you play the game because it can't recognize the CD-drive it just installed from, there is a big problem."
