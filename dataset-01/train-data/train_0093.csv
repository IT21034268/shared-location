5,Great product for the price!,"The vest and tie have an elegant, expensive look. I purchased the set for my son to wear to prom. Although we purchased a medium, the vest was very wide, I guess to accommodate many different sizes. I noticed this to be the case with rental vests that other guys were wearing also. My son is very slim and, while I am not at all even close to a seamstress, or even handy, I easily tacked in the sides for a more custom fit. We received the shipment quickly, in only a few days using standard shipping."
4,Paisley Dress Vest and Necktie Set,"cant really beat price. i bought i red and silver (thought i was buying white--oops). you get a tie and 5-button vest (w/ solid back). decent construction and materials--no complaints.shipping was okay, b/w 7-10 days under normal shipping option."
3,"ehh, cheaply made","Looks good from far, and might look good on pictures but it's very cheap material. The material is very thin. The buttons are made of plastic and very fragile. I only tried it on and almost broke one of the buttons.You get what you pay for!!!!"
4,Mens Paisely Design Dress Vest,"I am happy with the quality and the stitch but I would not say this is of a very good quality, the buckle behind the west is cheap and inferior, I bought this for a wedding and probably I may wear only once or twice a year so it is all-right for my purpose.Buyers beware of the size, I bought XL and thought it would fit my chest 44, but to my disappointment XL waist is 48,I will not return but I decided to alter it by myself.I hope they will advertise the sizes correctly to make purchase easier."
2,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!,"Overall quality is very poor. The fabric is very thin.Buttons are plastic and it came without one button, (at least did have one spare).Size runs small, I ordered it XL and size is as a Large."
4,"Very Nice Budget Vest, Though Picture Slightly Deceiving","Considering the price of this vest, the quality is very good. While it many not be a fine silk-type vest, it's nice and flashy enough to give the impression of taste. The vest also fits fine, and is true to size despite the complaints that others have made.I have two main complaints about this vest though: one is that the buttons are not fastened very securely to the vest itself, and the other is that the vest appears much lighter (almost white) in the picture than in life. The vest is indeed silver/grey, while in the picture it appears white.On the shipment side, it arrived very promptly - was ordered on a Wednesday afternoon, and it arrived on Saturday. As the second vest I have ordered from Krisar, I can say they are a very prompt and customer-oriented business."
1,Worst music...better than a sleeping pill (or 5),Slow dead music which sounded like 40's Tango music playing at half speed on bad equipment! I almost cried that each and every track was so painfully awful. I would give it to the Goodwill but don't want to be caught dead with it in my posession. Guess I'll sill swing by late at night and throw it over the fence!
1,Poor Quality DVD,"While Mr Blackstone is certainly a very fine magician, I cannot say the same for this very poor quality DVD. Clearly made via bad transfers from video tape,it's so soft and fuzzy sometimes it's hard to know what's happening onstage. For the price I expected better."
3,Not bad for a cover,"I stumbled across this CD and gave it a listen. I was very impressed with the accuracy of the covers, however it takes a lot to match the quality of a grammy award-winning band like Train. ""A Tribute to Train"" is a modest attempt at covering one of the best bands to ever hit the rock scene. However, most of the songs sound very mechanical and don't have the flow of music that the real Train seems to have. Also, all of the songs seem to have a punk-rock, harsh kind of sound. The reproduction of the instruments, however, is a positive for this collection of covers. On the subject of recording, the producer could have been a little more careful with the effects (I.E. synths and orchestras), as they tend to overpower the music. All in all, the CD is a worth a listen if you're a Train fan. 3 Stars"
3,Not Totally Satisfied,"This book would be very good for someone with a parent just starting into the elder care system. If your parent is already in the system and you are feeling very frustrated, guilty or generally upset with the situation it is not much help. I thought it would focus more on the ""Yourself"" and less on the parents. The focus was the parents."
2,Not Italian Language!,"The Mask of Satan (Black Sunday) is one of the most stylish gothic films made.Unfortunately this dvd edition makes watching the film a snoozefest.Originally shot in Italy and with an Italian soundtrack, this new ""restored"" version hits you with disgustingly camp American dubbing totally out of sync with the lip movements.The soundtrack has both inspired moments of psycho-ish grue, andembarrassing mills&boon; slop, but as this appears to be the original, there's nothing to be done about it.The dialogue however is another story!If the same dvd company can put out other Bava discs with original Italian language and subtitles - why not with this one?This film deserves much better, and hopefully a truly ""original"" cut can appear.On a higher note, the visual transfer is perfect, which is another reason why the inept soundtrack frustrates."
3,Good Effort,"This Black and White movie, also known as the Mask of Satin, is blessed with excellent camera work and a fairly good story line. The plot doesn't drag and the viewer is kept wondering what will happen next throughout the movie. A real surprise is the witch's failure to rise immediately.The movie has no gore or unnecessary violence but it does maintain a good spoky effect from start to finish. Fun to watch."
5,Not the first Remastered Version,"The version being released on Sept.18th is Not the first time this title has been remastered. It was released around 1999 as part of the Mario Bava Collection on DVD by Image Entertainment. This release was also the first time the ""European"" version was released here in the U.S.A. Therefore claiming that this is the first time this newer european version is being released is WRONG.According to the description given by Amazon it is the same version as the 1999 version: dubbed in english & the directors european cut with an essay & audio commentary by Tim Lucas. I hope that this newer version has a truly cleaner picture. The 1999 version picture is very good but does have some picture artifacts."
3,BLACK SUNDAY,"The movie was ok, and probably as good as most horror films of it's genre'. It still had that ""low budget"" look, however, despite good props and some decent acting. The film just wasn't up to par with a Vincent Price or Christopher Lee film from that era, no matter how you slice it. Probably the BEST thing was the storyline itself. If more had been spent on the production and it had been filmed in color with some REAL actors and actresses, it could have been a truly GREAT film instead of the cult film it is. Ms. Barbara Steele was compelling in her appearance, but didn't have the acting depth or talent to take her role above the cheap production she was cast in."
2,"Sort Of Boring, by awesomep","Maybe I am missing something that made this movie get good reviews from some of the viewers. Even though I am a Barbara Steele fan, this movie was quite boring to me."
2,Great Movie - Horrible Dubbing,"While visually well done and a great Bava effort, the dubbing is simply horrible. Out of the ""Bava Collection"" this was the only one I found difficult to watch."
4,black sunday,"this is a good movie with dracula people in real setting , butt ive seen so many draculas that wasnt that good if this was the first one ever seen would be great movie"
3,Great british horror!,Movie lived up to it's expectations.....a must for any movie collector who appreciates black and white along with horror.
3,Mood Piece,"I was very encouraged during the opening sequence of this movie. The opening scene involves the unique and horrifying execution of an apparent witch. But then we are quickly off to the land of 18th century carriages and castles. There are some amazingly chilling visuals and the cinematography and production design are first rate. But the story and the godawful dubbing are what ultimately sinks this movie. Call it heresy, but this movie is over-rated."
4,Good Movie,I first played the VHS tape in a VCR that seems to have audio problems. I thought it was the tape and wrote a lousey review. I tried a different VCR and the audio problem was gone. 4 stars here. Neat movie.
5,Love the Napa Style,"Michael Chiarello's Napa Style cooking show is one of my top rated cooking shows, and when I discovered his new, you too can cook his down to earth recipes, I just had to have this cookbook. The cook book is very self explanatary, the recipes succinct and the pictures make it all seem so easy. Michael's Napa Style is extremely refreshing in today's lifestyle."
4,Great Starter Cookbook,Christmas gift for our son who is just getting into cooking. He excitedly poured through it Christmas morning and is looking forward to the many recipes which meet his health needs.
5,Michael Chirellio's Casual Cooking,Great cook book....Michael is as usual one of the best chefs living. I use his book all the time...Thank you for this opportunity to support him.
4,Don't get it hot,"The product is a very nice thickness and should hold up well. There is one achilles heel and that is it can not take heat. We have taken to putting trivets and placemats down to prevent melt rings from forming. Even an warm plate would stick a bit to the surface.It is serving the purpose we bought it for, which is to protect the table cloth from the hazards of a 6 year old. It wipes up well and is quite thick."
5,Very good cable,"I bought it for my Bose system and the sound quality is very good. Did look at a lot of other reviews before deciding to buy this one, especially compared to the Philips one which is available at Walmart for $15. I am impressed with the sound quality. I can notice a difference when compared to the previous toslink cable that I had (Monster brand). This one has a click lock as well, so latches in pretty well."
1,"Battery is poor, and answer machine is touchy","We purchased this phone as a replacement for our old 900mhz phone. Out of the box everything seemed fine but after 1 year and very little use (we get maybe 4 phonecalls a week) the battery is toast. It won't hold a charge for 1 day (with no use). Even more annoying is the answering machine. If people don't talk loud enough, the message plays with mumbling in the background (so you can't hear what on earth people are saying!)I would look elsewhere if you are considering this phone."
2,Lots of problems,"I've had this phone for about a year now. There were a couple of problems right off the bat (not storing phone numbers of incoming calls & cumbersome deletion of caller ID information) but I could live with those. About nine months after buying it, I started having problems with the number keys. Now I have to press the buttons down so hard to get them to work that the phone is almost unusable. It's cheap, but you get what you pay for."
2,Not that great,"Bought this and had it for about a week. The sound quality was very clear, but the problem was that I couldn't change the volume of the ringer. If I wasn't in my room I couldn't hear it ring anywhere else in the house. Plus it didn't have that many features. I returned it today and bought a VTech, it's a brand that has worked well in the past for me."
4,Too small,"This is a very well made product, but it's too small for our dog. He's between seven and eight pounds. Right at the limit for the small. The next size up - medium - would be way too big; it's supposed to fit dogs up to fifteen pounds. Dogs come in so many sizes. It's too bad there isn't a small/medium size."
3,"OK, but...","The title of this DVD I believe is a little bit misleading. Jackie - as far as I can tell IS NOT one of the kids. Although the kid's movies were entertaining, I was expecting to see more movie features with Jackie actually in them. Only the ""Killer Meteors"" has Jackie doing any acting. The ""Jackie Chan Invincible Fighter"" is more like one big commercial. That particular promo was quickly made after Bruce Lee's untimely death, and seems more like an attempt by the Chinese film industry to divert people's attention elsewhere. IF YOU BUY THIS ONE, DO NOT BUY ""Jackie Chan Superstar Edition"" because you'll get the same 4 films. That detail is not clear enough on the Amazon selling pages."
1,Bootleg Disc,The disc I received was a poorly-copied bootleg. Most of the videos were such bad copies that they were unwatchable. Waste of money.
3,Interesting subject.,"It's a good book. It is written by a man who was actually there for the events.(Well, in the area) It is an interesting event in history. My only complaint is the way it's written. Understand, this man was not an ""author"" by present standards. He's a mountain doctor that wrote down the events. The book is good, but the way it's written you kinda feel like your reading the same story over and over. Here's the bad guys, they go get them, they hang them. There is no flow of events. It's more like a bunch of short stories than a book that flows over the entire event. There is another book on the subject and will probably try to read that one. It is a good book and worth the read. But I would say you may want to try a different book on this event written by a more skilled author. I'm not disappointed really, just kinda seemed like I was reading the same chapter over and over, just with different names and places."
3,Runny Babbit,"Was disappointed, because the book is not usable for young children. Will wait until my grandchildren are older.Book was in excellent condition."
3,"I'm a Big Fan, But...","...this is my least favorite work by one of my all-time favorites. Nearly everything else he's ever written has been a mong my all-time favorites, but this one didn't do it for me. Check out anything else Shel has written, such as Where the Sidewalk Ends, or anything by Jack Prelutsky, or Rainbow Soup by Brian P. Cleary, but I would pass on this title. Again, I love Silverstein's work, just not this one title."
2,"Not funny, hard to read","I have been a Silverstein fan since my childhood, so I was excited to purchase this book for my son; however, this book was a big disappointment. (I found out later that it was finished after his death, so maybe that has something to do with it.) It would have been ok if one or two of the poems were written in this style (of transposing the letters as in the name of the book), but it's every single poem and it makes it hard to read and not funny or silly at all. I regret buying the book and wish I had purchased one of his older titles."
5,Runny Babbit : A Billy Sook,"This book is a riot! It is fun to read alone or outloud to others. Everyone from my 4 year old grandson to my husband is enjoying the stories and special language Shel Silverstein created. I didn't think I would be blessed with another of his books, but I am pleasantly surprised to have found this treasure."
5,It lights up even the gloomiest day,"Shel Silverstein's books are a treat for anyone with a silly turn of mind. I thoroughly enjoyed Falling Up and found the Giving Tree heart warming. Runny Babbit a Billy Sook is another supurb example of the writer's style. The characters are dear, and the poems are delightful and skillfully crafted. My husband and I read them to one another one Sunday morning when we were off work together and enjoyed every minute.I can see pre-readers enjoying the mystery in the entangled words and older readers enjoying the nonsense of the whole thing. Adolescents may find the book ""too childish"" as they self-consciously attempt to achieve an adult persona, but most adults will enjoy the book for the shear childlike joy it expresses.The man will live forever in the hearts of his readers."
5,"Sly on the Tripper, if it Pits, You're a Frincess","Runny Babbit made my daughter slit her spides laughing, because he balks tackward. In one poem, he cooks for Linderella (who slies on the tripper). In another he wears a bowboy cat. In another his Romma Mabbit instructs him to use his slapkin not his neeve. In a rancy festaurant he eats chied fricken and oiled beggs!The crawings are mighty dute, too! If your kid bistens to looks, they will think it founds sunny! If your kids rikes to lead by him/herself, she will feel clery vever to recite these lymes out roud!It is very very boyful jook!"
3,As Much As I Love Shel...,"I wish he'd been posthumously represented by something other than this book. It's a cut below nearly all of his other work (and maybe that's why he never released it in his lifetime) and further, it's just too tough to decipher the jumbled words that make up the text. I'm not even beginning to suggest Runny Babbit is a bad book, no way at all, but I didn't feel the same affection for it I have for, well, for all those other Shel Silverstein books I've reviewed on Amazon, and always gave five stars.All that said, I really miss Shel Silverstein..."
4,A Very Pleasant Experience for Preschool/Elementary Audience,"Shel Silverstein, the popular children's poet, kept one of his best works until the end of his life. Published posthumously, this collection of silly rhymes about a bunny might be a merely pleasant diversion, except for the fact that most phrases have some consonants switched around, producing very funny results, as in:Dankee Yoodle tent to wownPiding on a ronyHe stuck a heather in his fatAnd malled it cacaroniThis kind of wordplay is likely to produce gales of laughter in a preschool/elementary audience, and it's an easy device for young kids to try out in regular conversation, creating a private family joke. One caution: adults ought to know in advance how they are going to respond when kids accidentally produce vulgar words.)This text is a little hard to read aloud, but there's an abridged CD available, and the performance by Dennis Locorriere is quite good."
5,"It REALLY IS a ""Billy Sook""!!!","As an adult, I found bis thook very rard to head.But dy maughter who is 9 was chuckling indeed!!!!My husband took a look at it tonight and wished he had it when he was younger and struggled with dislexia.I think the most fun part is trying to read it - so I'm not sure as a read aloud this would work. Too confusing! But the cute stories seem to go with any age (even those middle school boys I think would get a kick out of it if no one knew they were reading it!)Our favorite is when Runny gets the picken chox and his friends give him sicken choup. Oh Fery Vunny!!! Fery Vunny!!! Reminds me of when our child was little and referred to the restaurant as ""Led Robster"" all the time!"
5,Really Gets You thinking!,Runny Babbit is truly a wonderful book of silly poetry that REALLY gives your mind a workout! My children (ages 13 & 10) absolutely loved it. I should also mention that my son is dyslexic and found this book to be especially entertaining. Highest kudos to this one!!
4,Punny foems for kittle wids!,"Runny Babbit: A Billy Sook is a collection of 40 poems about a Bunny Rabbit. Get it? You'd better, because every last page uses the same letter-switching joke. In lesser hands this would be too much, but Shel Silverstein -- the master of expressive line drawings and simple witticisms -- creates a work of constrained genius. Runny Babbit is a hilariously hapless but bold character who has adorable little adventures (My favorite is the poem about the ""Ficken Charmer."") This will be best appreciated by the 4-7 year old set who love a good ""spoonerism,"" but even though it's no ""Sidewalk Ends"" (what is?) it's a worthwhile read and necessary addition to any Silverstein collection."
5,Read it Bush.,"Just what I was looking for. From its first beginnings till the Taliban takeover. It will show ""W"" why it will never be an independent country. I found it a captivating read up until the Taliban invasion. From there I have other books. I would recommend this as serving to present the history of Afghanistan."
1,"Oh no, you'll return it twice...","Great looking, excellent feel to the controls and yet I urge you to stay away! I returned the first one, which became unrecognizable in Windows XP, and the software utility that came with the unit didn't really do anything at all, though every time it ""claimed"" to have repaired successfully. Once frozen, it could not be re-formatted, and the reset button didn't do anything except cause the device to continually restart with a ""failed to initialize"" error...So I had the replacement for a week and the same thing happened again. One minute it works and the next it's all over!As far as I know both of the ones I returned are still in a reboot loop, it never stopped. Also, no bookmarking feature for the Audible books, creating playlists was lousy, the docs are nothing but an advert...what can I say...there is no excuse for a company to market a device this poorly tested. Perhaps it will improve, but as for now it's absolute junk."
1,This product is deceptive,I received this product and followed the instructions for installation. Much to my surprise there was no way to make it function (even with my previously stored music) without connecting to Napster which is a premium service (with a free trial period).I think this product is fundamentally deceptive by not letting people know that you MUST be connected with Napster to make it work.If that isn't bad enough I could not get Napster to work on my computer probably because I use Firefox and refuse to use Internet Explorer.
1,what a disaster!,"ok, 1st i opened the box put it on the charger and it just made a buzzy noise and wouldnt turn on! when (a few hours later) i tried switching it on it finally worked! yipeeee.so i then inserted the cd which told me i needed media player 9 and to uninstall media player 10 and get media player 9 again.""microsoft does no longer have a download for media player 9 for windows xp""f**k!by this point im pulling my hair out cuz the webpage and user manual are cr@pi finally found out how to ""roll back"" my media player to the last version and thought my problems were over.it took ages for the pc to recognise the new hardware and when i finally get everything installed, its now sitting on my pc desk making a buzzy sound again and wont switch on!!!what a useless complicated daft piece of sh** im going to send it back now and i better get a refund or else!"
2,"Good player, but only plays Napster files","I bought this because I have a large library of MP3s that I want to transfer to a device and listen to. I also wanted a lot of extra storage for other files. What I found was that this player only allows you to listen to MP3s that are downloaded from the Napster application. Even if your MP3s are burned from your own cd, you can't listen to them with this player UNLESS you burn them with the Napster CD ripper. This was not listed in any documentation, the salesperson at the store was not aware of it and the Samsung website does not mention this. I found this out because I called Samsung and they told me there was something wrong with Napster..I then called Napster who told me this.If you are looking to use Napster and store a lot of extra files, this player should be fine. If you are looking to listen to all the MP3s you have accumulated over the years, don't waste your time with this player."
4,Great Player but Stay Away from Napster Software!,"For starters, if you want a player that stands out as a great alternative for the ipod, then this would probably be it. Having mentioned that, make sure you don't install the Napster Software! It screwed about 10GB of my music on the player, and I had to re-download it all over again. So as long as you stay away from napster your fine.I've used both Windows Media Player and Real Player to download my music and they worked fine, and hopefully Samsung will release a plug-in for iTunes like they did for other Samsung MP3 players.Again, I cannot stress the importance of not installing the Napster Software (a clear option on the setup page) if you want to use this player to play your entire CD collection and music downloads."
4,"If you buy it used and cheap, it's a good deal","It's true that the device is meant to be used with the Napster software, but you don't have to. It is also possible to use Windows Media Player 10 to synchronize your device with your MP3. As pointed by others, you can also copy the files directly and then rebuild the library with Samsung's recovery utility.In any case, you have to be a minimally technically skilled to do these tasks.For the audiophiles, it is important to note that this device cannot play OGG files, contrary to what Amazon's description says. It plays MP3s and WMAs fine, which is enough for almost everybody.I think it is a fine iPod alternative."
2,Buy this if you want to take it to the shop...,"I have had this since December. I agree the player is cool and has good features such as the ability to record from the radio but if it breakes down what is the point? I am now having to bring in my player for the SECOND time for servicing. Not a big deal unless you want to wait a whole month for the process and if you don't have all of your music backed up... My suggestion, go with something that has been proven to work that also has good features, not this player."
3,Kids In the Hall - Vol. 1,"I loved Kids in the Hall back when it was on the air. It was a classic comedy show. I bought this DVD cuz I knew I'd get a good laugh. I did, but less than I thought I would. Maybe my sense of humor has changed a little, but I didn't find a lot of it as funny as I had hoped. There are some classic bits, like the Head Crusher and the Business Trappers. So, for that reason, it's a must have. But, about half of it was kinda throw away for me. The ""Kids"" are superb comedians when they hit the mark. Maybe Season 1 they were still ironing out some of the kinks. I recommend it, just not very highly."
3,Skimpy on the Laughs,"I felt that there were too few skits and I definitely didn't agree with the producer's definition of ""best""."
4,"Happy Tree Friends are definitely ""Overkill""","These are some wild guys. How could everything go wrong in the lives of these characters. I mean, strictly for the grown and it doesn't matter if the grown are sexy or not. Murphy's Law definitely applies when it comes to these guys."
4,A book for those who lived through WW II,"I purchased this book for my in-laws who lived through WW II. My father-in-law served in the Army in India as a medic, while my mother-in-law waited at home. They have read numerous books about the war, but until now had not seen a book about life on the home front or about the role of women in the war. They are really enjoying the book. Give your WW II relatives a taste of nostalgia; send them this book."
4,Our Mothers' War,Interesting book. Covered areas of women's involvement that I was unaware. A good mix of personal stories and overview facts.
3,Other Sources.....,See Women of the Homefront by Pauline E. Parker for first hand accounts of life on the homefront during WWII.
5,I love it,"I guess I'm a bit of a geek and I just love the character of Gollum in The lord of the Rings movies and in The Hobbit. At the same time I think Andy Serkis is a brilliant actor, with a bit of nice humor - so this book is just a great way to get a behind-the-scenes look of how this character was made. Normally I don't like to read books, but this is brilliant, informative and funny.Would recommend it to any LOTR & Hobbit fans who are interested in knowing a bit more about how it was made."
5,Some of the very best music by Otis Grand,"I've following this guitar man since the mid-1980's, when I first saw him playing live (doing an uncanny slow blues à la BB King as NOBODY else, by the way), and from then on I've been waiting to find some of that blues magic (no just masterful guitar playing: magic) on almost every recording of him. Well, here it is -to my ears- the cream of the top: the best recording by this blues master probably. The singer, the band, the program and the guests (Joe Louis Walker) are all great, but Otis is nothing sort of simply SUPERB.If you can preview it somewhere, you just GOT to do it. If you can't, you just do yourself a big favor and buy it."
4,Not THAT bad...,"...but still pretty darned cheesy, as the previous reviewer stipulates.Ana Luisa Peluffo is a little past her prime, but still sexy enough, and La Princesa Lea, WOW, yeah!The martial arts action is somewhat lame in the staging, but I've seen worse in any number of low budget Hong Kong and Taiwanese productions. Plus, this movie has more blood than many of those other movies (including a hand chopped off with a machete, complete with spurting wrist stump!).Yes, fun for the whole family."
1,Bad fit. for a Nissan Altima,Does not fit right. loose and looks like it belongs on another car. I bought it using the guide lines for my car but its loose and flappy. I dont like it.
2,It's cute but not durable,This is a lil kinz that was given as a gift to a 3 year old. Within two weeks the midline seam on the underside opened and beans spilled out. This appears to be a defect in manufacturing as the three year old minimally played with it. She happened to take it to bed and when she awoke her bed was covered in beads. Would not buy this particular product again. Have two others that have been fine.
1,New members can't enter website since Christmas,"My daughter has been so excited, hoping that Santa would bring her a few webkinz, because she has heard so much about playing with them on the webkinz website. Santa was kind enough to leave three Christmas morning.However, GANZ/WEBKINZ was not nice enough to provide a working website, Christmas morning, or the 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st and counting. I have tried to get some response from the company regarding this problem, but there is no link to an actual customer service email address on the webkinz site, unless you are REGISTERED! The address on the GANZ site gets NO response whatsoever. YOu may notice that the one part of my review I rated above 1 star was durablilty. It's quite simple- if it don't work, children don't play with it. Looks like, at this rate, my daughter''s webkinz will last forever ! Now, that's what I call durability ! The Better Business Bureau list this company as unsatisfactory, now you know why !"
3,great carry with you book,"it has some great info in it. Nothing that I didn't already know though. As a pagan & a stage 4 cancer patient it has helped me with some basics I had forgot from chemo brain. If your new to us in this faith, it is a good learning tool and it can go with you without taking up a lot of space."
2,Maudlin and incredible,"Having started by reading Rice's Cloud Nine, which I thought was very good, I have become more and more disappointed, first by Dream Country, then by Summer Light. The leap to fantasy (angels, angel dust, etc.) I could make, but unrealistic details I could not overlook.Where is there a high-security prison in which an inmate is able to converse with a young boy standing outside the fence? At one point the boy even touches the inmate's shoe!! And this child has apparently arrived at the prison on foot. I don't know about the rest of you, but the high-security prisons I'm aware of aren't in quite such friendly neighborhoods.I was also bothered by Rice repeatedly casting the Stanley Cup finals in May. I don't follow hockey but I know I'm still hearing news about the game in June.These inconsistencies create such a feeling of unease that it's impossible to accept the ""truth"" of the rest of the story. Very disappointing. Surely the last of hers that I will try."
2,Wanted to like it,"This is the first book I have read by this author and I am afraid it will be my only one. I really liked the part with Kylie and Natalie, it could have been such a wonderful book but the author ruined it with the Martin and May. Martin was such an a**hole, who would have ever put up with that and subject your daughter to that type of behavior. May was a nag and should have shut up about his father. I think if the book would have been about a hundred pages shorter and all the yelling left out it would have been a great book. I just could not stand all the drama. Who wants to read that crap?"
4,Great summer read for romantics :),"The only reason i don't give this book five stars is because i think five stars should be reserved for truely amazing works of literature. This book however, was highly enjoyable. I couldn't put it down after i started to read it. I have a soft spot for stories like these. It was quite moving and i loved all the characters. They made the book and story come alive. To the people who think it's to sappy for them, i say, then why read novels that have a romantic vibe about them? Aren't they all just going to be too sappy for you? All in all...great summer read. I recommend it highly!"
2,"I wanted to like this book, but... SPOILER","This was my first book by this author. I really thought it could have been interesting, but it just ended up boring. The main character, May, seems so indecisive. Kind of a doormat, really. You never really get to know her at all. The story of how these two meet and fall in love is just too unbelievable. I mean they barely had a conversation, and next thing they were getting married. (A wedding that excludes almost every important person in the bride's life, for some reason.) I was kind of bothered by Martin, every time he gets mad at someone, he just stomps off. And I never got why May keeps nagging him about his father. I ended up skipping to the end of the book just to get it over with."
2,Are you Serious?,"I can't believe all the readers who find this an amazing read or get up early to finish reading this book! Yes, I stuck it out and finished the book, but to think this was one of the best books to read,YIKES. You really need to read a lot more if this is one of the best. It is sappy, boring, predictable and totally unbelievable. Yeah right, owls in a bridal shop. A hockey player who is so ""in love"", with a character like May. Really? Only in a silly story like this. Sorry, I just don't buy it. I'd rather read Cinderella again!"
3,"Show me, don't tell me","Within the first dozen pages, the author tells the reader that the child is special, that May Taylor's female ancestors have magic, that Martin is rugged handsome etc. There are no revelations, no suspense, no surprises. May's conversations with her friend Tobin are so banal that they hardly advance the plot or develop characters. May herself doesn't really have a personality, the author TELLS us that things happened to May or May has feelings. I was disappointed in this book, based on the glowing reviews."
3,Summer Light,"I think the book was quite good, however, being a hockey fan I picked up on something. On p53 Luanne says Game 3 also went into overtime, and this time the Oilers won it 2-0. I have discussed this with many people and I don't think it is possible to win a game 2-0 in overtime. The win would be 1-0. I do get upset when authors don't research or have professionals check their work. I can't find an e-mail anywhere for Ms Rice so I am stating my comments here."
2,Better potato books out there,"While this may be a handy reference to the world of licensed potatoes, surely there are several better choices out there. This just briefly glances over the distinguishing differences, and pays little attention to the newer developments in tuberology such as the Mican product. This is probably a good book for beginners."
1,Useless Customer Service No Support,"I bought this phone used and it had missing AC adapter. I was hoping to be able to obtain it somewhere as well as an user's manual. What a major disappointment - you'd expect that product from such a major manufacturer would have parts available everywhere, first class support, web site with all kinds of information - well... forget it! This telephone uses very unique power supply - 6VAC there is no way to find it anywhere. Manufacturer's web site is utterly useless. Customer service 800 numbers are backed up, representatives based i India or who knows where and offer very limited help if any, most likely they will send you to a Sears or RadioShack store. Yes this is a discontinued model but not that old and this lack of support raises concern for the current line of products from Thompson, GE and RCA - once they become discontinued are they to be junked? I know one thing - I won't take chances and stay clear of this manufacturer's line of products."
4,Fair but not very deep information on training,"The German shepherd Today, gives fairly enough about the breed and taking care of your puppy or mature dog and some information on training your dog. But nearly half of the book gives the names of the competition winner dogs or heritages of them. I have a 4,5 months old German Shepherd puppy and after finished reading the book I found myself many questions about caring or training my dog. I guess I should also buy the author's other bookExpert Obedience Training for Dogs, Fourth Edition"
5,This is a great book for beginners or experienced breeders,"An outstanding reference for owners or prospective german shepherd owners. Sits on our coffee table, when we aren't reading it"
4,wonderful commentary from actual breeder/handlers,this book was very knowledgable from people who actually work with the breed. i would like to have seen more of a conformation slant (rather than obedience or schutzhund perspective) and i was disappointed in the lack of color pictures . but overall i found a great deal of usefull information contained within.
4,OK but a little out of date...,"I think most of this info has been covered in other, more recent publications. Amd. I think it was last updated in '95 so it's out of date. If it's your first and only book, it is certainly worth reading."
3,"Some Good Info, But...","As a first-time GSD owner, this was the second book I purchased and read about the breed. While much of the information was useful, I was also left with many questions.I disagree with the harsh training methods outlined in this book. Not only did my puppy not learn from them, but they left her with issues that needed to be resolved before she could learn anything else effectively. Also, the health section left a bit to be desired.All of the information that I considered to be helpful has been found in many other publications. As an all-encompassing book it's okay, but I'd just as soon get my money back and spend it on two or three other books -- I'd get more useful information that way."
2,Good idea poorly executed,"Sears sells this phone as a Craftsman model for $80. Circuit City for $50. I bought two (one for me, one for dad) and discovered, to my horror, that the base station is a GIANT wall-wart (no power cord) that takes up all of a duplex outlet. The wall-wart is as big as the base of the phone. REALLY stupid, idiotic design. Also, the one I bought was defective in that it would not ring. Worked to call out, but no indication of incoming calls. Took it back. My dad's example works.Handset is also large and not comfortable to hold - sharp edges. It's supposed to have a load ringer, but judging from the test settings I tried, it's not very load at all at its loadest.I'd buy it at a close-out price of under $40, but not for a cent more."
1,I got this as a gift and I feel bad that they wasted $$$,Phone broke after minimal use. Not a good shop phone. The other reviews say it all. Stay away.
1,Don't waste your cash,"I bought mine last year from Sears (Craftsman). Poor reception, tiny numbers that can't be punched with work gloves on, not loud enough ringer and the batteries died after only a couple of months along with the display."
1,slight problems,"Right away the little part on the base broke off. Bugs me, even though the repalcement battery seems to still charge. And, for some reason, even the charge on the other side does not seem to hold.I have the Craftsman which is the same item and I really like it. It seems that they were not made as well as production went forward."
1,Cute book but beware!,"We got this for our son. He liked it a lot-so much so, he started imitated Elmo and became dependent on a blanket, which we were finally able to wean him off of. Keep that in mind!"
4,A new favourite,My 2yo loves this book. She's never seen Sesame Street but has picked up on the characters quickly. She enjoys all the flaps to open.
2,TOO MANY FLAPS with hardly nothing exciting under them,"This book has tons of lift flaps, too many for our taste. You get distracted and it doesn't have a good story line. Not a good time consumption book."
2,"Cute book, poor quality","The story for the book is really cute and my son loves Elmo, but the build quality of the book is really poor. My son has ripped off all the lift tabs within only a few weeks of having the book. We have other books with lift tabs and they are built stronger and he has not ripped them off, but this one is now just about finished.The only way I would recommend this book is if you child is disciplined enough to not rip off the lift tabs."
3,"A little busy, not much to read","Even though there aren't many words to read and the book is a little busy with so much going on in pictures, my 15 month old still loves Elmo. She loves books. This isn't her favorite book, but it's okay for a quick look."
3,"Good Story, But Wish Tabs Were Sturdier","This story follows the movie Elmo in Grouchland to a degree. Fun book, good story and my kids love it. HOWEVER, the tabs are flimsier than one would expect for a toddler's book. I read this story to my kids--both under four--and allow them to lift the tabs, but don't let them flip through this book alone because I know they'll rip the tabs off."
2,I love books!,"I think this book will work for my daughter my only concern it appears the flip portion will get destroyed, they are very thin and small, I can see her ripping them off the book quite easily. I released them from their protective tabs beforehand and I had trouble finding them all some were very small and I think they may hinder the surprise underneath...we will see!"
5,Awesome,"Purchased with Elmo blanket... Really encourages baby to sleep in her ""big girl"" bed!! Very sweet book! Great to read at night before bedtime!"
3,Fully Rusted within 6 months,Pros:-Low price-Fairly easy installation (Scion TC) with supplied instructions.-Fast DeliveryCons:- Was rusted within 6 months (I live in MN)
4,This is classic puzzle/ problem book,"The section with the Fibonacci and Lucas Binet formulas is classic.The tribonacci polynomial on page 165 is wrong,but I didn't know it was invented by Mark Feinberg, either...I'm going to try to make digraph matrices for the Knight's tours.His Kn graphs are way before most people knew they were at all important!He explains solutions in a way that teaches how to better approach such problem. I like this book!"
1,I guess no one is perfect....... Not even Michael Moore,"Obviously it won awards, obviously he is famous for his documentaries.... but I was shocked when I watched this. It logically collapsed upon itself. I started to watch it, and the longer it went the more upset I became, it jumped from idea to idea, and tied together no loose ends, and left more questions than answers. Now you might say, thats the point, but wrong, because the questions that your left with are, ""what is he talking about?"" ""how does that follow from that?""there are so many inconsistencies, obvious editing tricks, and simple non-sequirtors in this film that even a 4th grader could see it was closer to fiction than the truth. Not only did this film dissapoint me, insult my intelligence, but it also made me not want to buy any other product that michael moore ever produces.... I dont think I will even watch the Oscars again, especially if they reward such mediocre work for documentary work."
3,Biased.,"Beware passive viewers, this doco, although very well made, is actually a very skewed little piece indeed. Statistics can prove ANYTHING. In a university paper I once researched i proved without doubt that children who eat chocolate ice cram rather than strawberry are more likely to engage in criminal activity as teenagers. Is this true? No. Do the statistics support this? Yes. Look at the number of gun deaths in Australia compared to the U.S.A. It seems overwhelming. Now go and research the difference in population. Less amazing. Did Mike Moore ever stop to think that Australia is the mass killing capital of the world and that the Port Arthur massacre had a much bigger body count? Lazy journalism with points for passion and style."
1,for those who are already brainwashed,"Moore's attempt to discover the causes of violence fall far short of his goal...but you wouldn't know it to talk to his defenders. This is the problem: as bad and boring as this docudrama is, the viewers who have already made up their minds to defend this gibberish passing for objectivity will continue to praise it not for its quality of information but for its propaganda value. Hollywood is well-known for pushing political propaganda more often in subtle form, but in this case, they have voted for OVERT half truths and lies over substance. Hollywood and Mr. Moore is setting a dangerous precedent."
1,Appalling in its disregard for the truth...,...this movie is one of the greatest pieces of distorted disinformation ever made. The infamous Nazi and Soviet propaganda film makers or even Oliver Stone have nothing on mike moore. What's really scary is that plenty of Americans think that this movie is factual.
1,Worst Kind of Propaganda,"It would be giving Michael Moore too much credit to say that this is a dangerous film. But in fact it is, but not for the reasons M.M. would like it to be. Weaving a thread of personal bias through the documentary format is more corrupt than any elected politician could ever get away with. I was also upset by the fact that he used a bate and switch tactic in that he used the publicity of the Columbine tradgedy as a spring board for his real agenda, gun control. Removing the pumphandle from the well will not stop the spread cholera nor will gun control remove the spread the violent use of guns. The problem is still in the ground.The fact that M.M. received an academy award for this effort is even more distressing in that people are more impressed by entertainment than the honest and credible evaluation of social issues challenging American culture.For a more credible evaluation of the Columbine tradgedy see psychologist Elliot Aronsen's book ""Nobody Left to Hate."""
1,A Sucker Is Born Every Minute,"The apparent success of this non-documentary propaganda film is one of the most compelling affirmations yet of P. T. Barnum's famous dictum, ""a sucker is born every minute."" If I had to devise a tag-line for ""Bowling For Dollars"" it would be ""even fat, ugly, unshaven, talentless dropouts can make it in America.""Don't waste your time or your money. This one ain't worth it."
2,didnt like this,I didnt like this. It seemed to slow for me to watch. I threw it in the trash sometime ago
1,I don't like being tricked,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is great. However, it is the one of the worst documetaries that I have seen. Moore takes pride in spinning things to get what he wants. The very sad thing is that people are ignorant enough to believe him. If you believe ""Bowling for Columbine"" you probably believe that Spinal Tap was a real rock band. Check this site out for the truth on the spin www.bowlingfortruth.com"
1,Too liberal!,"I'm a lib too but I draw the line when Mike marches into the K-Mart headquarters with the paralized victims of the shooting in tow and demands an explanation as to why they sold the bullets.Michael, K-Mart is not to blame. Anyone could have sold those. You're acting like a trial attorney. Get it together and quit trying to blame those not responsible and for your own personal gain."
1,LENI RIEFENSTAHL OF THE AMERICAN LEFT,"Michael Moore is talented, compelling and successful. He is a propagandist who takes information, mixes in about 15 percent truth with about 70 percent lies and about 15 percent exaggeration, and passes it off as journalism.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF ""BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN""..."
1,"Garbage in, Garbage out","Boy, do I feel dumb spending my money for this poece of trash. I should've known better knowing that Michael Moore was behind it. The footage and histroical facts of Columbine have been cleverly re-aranged to fit Moore's leftist propagannda agenda.This does NOT make for a genuine documentary film maker. This video is simply awful NOT RECOMMENDED! NOT EVEN AS A DOORSTOP."
1,Reality Check and Polish,"Let us all keep in mind that it was possible to create Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" in a believeable presentation on screen. Entertainment is just that. Laugh, cry, and especially be scared at this one. I beg of all of you who are interested in the political views of this film to read the document that made the United States the greatest, most free and powerful nation in the world: our constitution. Education and reality is the only thing to save Americans from Communist who are convincing with a microphone in front of them. I watched it. I also have three post graduate degrees in politics and policy-making. Laugh, cry, be scared and most of all, educate yourselves to protect against people like Mr. Moore."
1,Don't take Moore's work at face value.,"Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" is NOT a documentary. A documentary treats a given subject objectively, without editorializing, editing speeches and timelines, or inserting fictional material. The movie is carefully crafted to appeal to your emotions, and at that task it succeeds handily - at the expense of the truth. ""Bowling for Columbine"" is deliberately deceptive. I would have no problem with this film, were it not portrayed as a documentary. It is anything but."
1,"amusing, but trite",I'm really tired of these one sided perspectives. You see this from both sides of these topics. Where did all of the reasonable people go? Not the movies.
3,Interesting Twist,This movie explained a lot of the why of Columbine. It was funny and yet sad. It showed how one man (Michael Moore) could insert his own beliefs into what was supposedly a documentary. I would recommend this movie if you have the ability to see past the biased reporting.Across the Universe (Two-Disc Special Edition)
5,I think Mr Moore is asking questions...,"Bowling for Columbine tells a story that must be told.If this is an arguement for gun control laws, I offer these questions.Why do any laws exist? To protect the rights of individuals?Why do handguns exist? To protect the rights of the person holding the gun?What rights do you think you have when someone is pointing a deadly weapon at you?When a driver possessing a handgun is accidentally forced off the road by an inattentive driver using the cell phone, whose rights need protecting?At ANY time, when someone thinks he or she is being mistreated, is a deadly weapon a suitable solution."
3,it is also a dangerous thing...,"While there are some merits to this documentary, I got to ask: if Charlton Heston didn't want the interview to be shown, and Michael Moore got away by throwing the roll of film out the gate to his coworkers and telling them to ""flee the scene"", and make it against the will of Charlton Heston, isn't it also ""me, me, me"" which is an attitude Michael claims to be against?Also, does he have to broadcast the message that Bush is not the majority elected president... it was, at least, close enough... there is hard to always get absolute fairness in the world, but it is quite close; he doesn't need to bash it. Also, bashing the Democratic party? It is purely his personal view. Columbine is one thing, but his political preference is another thing. When he thinks he is 100% or 99% right, it is also a dangerous thing... just like..."
1,GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE...,"It's those damn bullets!We all know this movie is about attacking the Constitution and the few remaining fragments of our right to bear arms.Every Michael Moore movie is unwittingly a documentary on the dangers of ""Super Sizing"" your every hourly meal. Everybody, don't eat super-sized fast food meals every hour on the hour. It will turn you into a big fat bloated greasy whale and it severely lowers your IQ."
1,IT SUCKS! LIES AND NO TRUTHS,"GOD I HATE THIS MOVIE!AND THIS SO CALLED HOLLYWOOD DIRECTOR, ONLYHOLLYWOOD WOULD GIVE THIS CLOWN AN AWARD FOR WHAT? LIES AND NONSENSE . DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS BOMB!WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY? ARE PEOPLE REALLY THAT STUPID TO BELIEVE THIS NUT! I GUESS YOU ARE."
2,OK!,The director has some interesting theories in this documentary but presents them in an often simplistic way.
1,A fictitious movie from a fictitious filmmaker.,"If this is a documentary, then so is ""Forrest Gump"". Both took bits and pieces of actual events and manipulated them to suit their own fictional dramatic purposes. Basically, Michael Moore is exploiting a couple of tragedies for his own profit under the guise of having a mission to ""educate"" people. Immoral, unethical, offensive and disgusting. He is arrogant enough to think we will all just fall for it. Sadly, many people will (and obviously have) without taking the time to seek out the truth and form their own well-founded opinions instead of blindly accepting the position of some slimy (and all too successful) con artist."
1,"Use a gun, go to jail.","For Adults Only! Please do not allow a child to see this!I do not like guns. Shouldn't we learn to use verbal communication before we pull a gun on someone without reason? Communication can be very effective. There are times when I do wish I had a gun to protect myself inside my home, butcalling the police quickly helps too. I do not get myself in a situation for anger and guns to be needed. Some people use guns under false pretenses, to steal, to injure a human or animal, someone's pet and sometimes on someone else's property. People get gun-happy. They want to use a gun. They are obsessed. Perhaps a movie excited them.Like the laws says, ""Use a Gun...Go To Prison"".Right on! Thanks Trey Parker with what you said about how they make you feel bad in high school.WARNING: This DVD shows footage of real people being shot or shooting themselves in suicide. Many dead people are shown."
1,A total farce,"This documentary was completely disgusting. I don't think this man has any real convictions or respect for the subject matter he covers or for his audience. Everything he does and says is simply for effect. There isn't a shred of integrity in his work. It's not his ""opinions"" I'm attacking, I truly don't believe he has a single well-formed one. He is entertaining now and then, but beyond his ability to make a clown out of himself, and those he interviews he has no merrit. He never makes a firm statement, only allusions. He never approaches anyone in a straightfoward matter, but elbows his way into conversation with them and then cross examines them in a no-win fashion. There are people out there who risk everything to expose the truth. This man is a total parody of those people and should be ashamed. Especially ashamed for exploiting the tragic shooting of an innocent child."
1,"Worst excuse for a ""documention"" I have ever seen.","Pure waste of money. It sells as a ""documentation"" but is nothing but a big huge lie. If there was common sense on this earth that guy should have his Oscar revoked."
1,Boring and liberally bias!,"I don't understand how anyone could sit through this whole movie without falling asleep. Seriously, I don't know what you've heard or read about this movie but it is soooo bad. Michael Moore gets off on thinking he's in the know about everything. His interviews are lame and bland and the whole movie is shot from an extremely far-left liberal perspective. The editing doesn't flow smoothly and the information he's revealing isn't shocking or really that interesting. I'd be happy if Michael Moore never got in front of a camera again. If you're a tool, you'll probably love this movie."
4,A Michael Moore Documentary,I am a collector of Michael Moore's documentaries but I try to keep my ratings unbiased. Moore has made some great movies and some not so outstanding. This one was timely and good.
1,biased and unbalanced reporting from a morbidly obese man,please dont waste your precious time about watching this crappy documentary about the problems of gun control which seems like biased and one sided reporting to me.avoid
1,"Terrible ""documentary""","I would expect an award winning documentary to not be so incredibly one-sided and full of short sighted views on topics that the director twists and turns into something cicumstancial to warp the minds of easily swayed (or should I say ""open"") minds. Yes, Michael Moore, it is your right to voice your viewpoints, but why should any of us care to listen to them when they are too skewed to be thought of as educational enough to be the topic of a documentary."
1,Documentary?,"Michael Moore's ""Black Box"" politics ruined this film.It could have been truly great.Instead,the film is ridden with deceit and quasi-truths.Never was this more evident than in the segment of NRA president Charlton Heston where dubious timing and creative editing declassify this film to a vanity flick for Michael Moore and a mockumentary for us.Hollywood should seriously consider taking back his Oscar and and give it to someone who made a real documentary in 2002!"
1,Torturous,I feel Roger & Me was one of the most important films made about the crime that corporate America committed and is still committing against the working class. Now Moore is becoming a caricature of himself. The blue-collar look that worked well for Roger & Me is clearly phony facade. Moore's cynicism and just plan meanness at times has no home in working class America. It is liberal Hollywood all the way.
1,Unreliable,"The problem with Michael Moore is that he is agenda driven. His facts can't be relied upon. Although I'm an advocate of gun control, I wish Michael Moore would leave the subject alone. He does more to hurt our cause via name calling and sensationalizing."
1,One star is too generous,"I don't know what to say, but this was a complete waste of my two hours. There was absolutely no point to this ""documentary"". Moore has offered his audience nothing new to the gun debate. Moore ,whom I enjoyed on T.V. nation, has really lost his focus. What was the whole point of him going to missile manufacturer? How's that revelant to the debate? Was it cool to pick on a guy who is suffering from Alzheimers? Heston may be the figure head of an organisation that is odious to the far left wing, but he is still a human being and deserves some respect and compassion.I belive Moore is just using his position to get rich! All I ever see him doing now is railing against white males. Does he actually have any solutions? Anybody can pick apart an administration, or the ills of society. It is something quite different to actually propose solutions."
1,"screwy film, and it can be proved","It is quite good propaganda filmmaking, I freely admit. But it is highly deceitful. If you don't believe me then check out http://www.spinsanity.org and, no it is not some ""whacko attacko"" site. The people there are as likely to criticize rightists such as President Bush, Rush Limbaugh, and Ann Coulter as they are people like Michael Moore. In fact, spinsanity.org is coming out with a book critical of President Bush in August called ""All the President's Spin: George W. Bush, the Media and the Truth"". So don't dismiss spinsanity.org, and don't believe what Michael Moore shows or tells you."
1,The other side of the coin,"For a critical analysis of this work, please visit www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html. Several reviewers have called Bowling for Columbine an ""eye opener."" Try this and open them a little wider."
1,HACK,"I agree with Weston Kathman; this is just more half truths and ajenda before reason. I dont want more ego-centered propaganda, I want the truth. And I also agree that he should not be profiting off of tragedy. Lets face it if he were not stretching the truth and making sensational claims but was balanced and factual he would not be this well known. The narrow road to truth will always be difficult and vacant."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"THE MOST DISTURBING THING ABOUT READING THESE REVIEWS IS THAT PEOPLE KEEP CALLING THIS A DOCUMENTARY. DOCUMENTARIES HAVE FACTS. THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF LIES STRUNG TOGETHER WHICH USES A TRAGEDY FOR MOORE'S PERSONAL GAIN! WHAT A CREEP! IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH ABOUT GUNS, GET A BOOK BY JOHN R. LOTT OR GARY KLECK FROM AMAZON."
1,Great FICTIONAL Movie,"As a fictional movie, it was great. But it came short on any facts. Just a spewing of liberal trash. This movie is full of fictional characters, portrayed by actors."
1,Do you consider yourself intelligent?,"To quote a good friend of mine... ""Michael Moore is no more than a necrophiliac!"" He gets off on exploiting disasters. The worst part of this movie is that people with above average intelligence are sucked into believing what they are told in the movie. I think that the man would have better luck in politics as he is very good at spreading his ignorance. Every bit of the way through this movie I found myself arguing with the TV and disproving, on my limited knowledge of the situations in question, almost every comment he made. Further while he comes off as very convincing, many should notice that he never really comes to a point, he is merely preaching to hear himself talk. I would suggest watching this movie but only for the thought of knowing what you are talking against when a Michael Moore fan tries to spout some of his mind rotting views."
1,This film is a total farce,"I am just amazed what a big, fat liar like Michael Moore can seem to get away with. And then be rewarded for. This movie was a total lie from the get go. He edited the hell out of this thing to make it sound just how he wanted it. Why is it so hard for these people to stick with the facts. Don't just assume what this moron has produced is factual. Don't just take my word for it. Read up on it for yourself. This movie should have never even made it to any screen or video rental. I'm not sure who's backing this guy financially, but they must be very desperate and pathetic. This movie is not and never will be a documentary. Its pure fiction from a very warped mind."
5,A wake up call.,This was a similar to Michael Moore's other film on 9/11 again spelling out in a simple way what is wrong with the country.Have always had a high regard for Moore over the years watching his tv documentaries in the UK and hope the message sinks in.
1,Proven to be Fraudulent,"This documentary seeks to destory our constitutional right to bear firearms. Something that Moore doesn't seem to realize through these lies is that PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE not that guns kill people!! Our society isn't at fault for that six year old girl's death in Michigan, rather the parents of the young boy who shot her are at fault for their inexcusable irresponsibility!! It has been proven that this documentary is full of exaggerated lies. Personally, I think Moore should be more worried about someone harpooning his obese body than attempting to amend our Constitution. Not recommended."
1,VERY MISLEADING,"Oscar...?????????????????????? Why? This is one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. This is a badly conceived, primitively arranged and non-professionally filmed nothing about a serious thing. There are some good points raised but the argument supporting them is so weak and lacking knowledge that points go to the other side rather than to Michael Moore's side. It did not feel like authors knew the subject or even understood it. It was very disappointing and very misleading."
5,Thank God for Michael Moore,"My daughter and I cheered when he won the Oscar for this film. It makes ""the fear factor"" so clear. We loved this film, and I am pre-ordering my own copy."
5,Mandatory Viewing for all Americans...,Amazingly frank and poignant film from a man who is not afraid to ask the hardest questions or tell the most painful truths.
1,A Movie for the Sheeple,This is a great movie if you are a mindless sheep. Moore uses lies to present his radical leftist agenda in the film. Him and his fanatical friends wish to abolish the 2nd Ammendment of the Constitution and he uses lies and propaganda to persuade the morons watching. The Nazis used similar tactics in controlling opinions. Hitler wouldn't have needed Josef Goebells had he had Michael Moore at his disposal.
1,unfortunate,"What's most frustrating is that the people who need to understand what guns do to our country are not listening. The reviews who agree with Moore already believed in his message. To me, Moore is just confirming what some people already believe.Things will not change because his film is based on ridiculing people who are gun owners instead of using subtlety. How can you expect gun owners to change their minds after this? This film is too blunt and needs better style."
1,Misleading,"I watched this documentary and was surprised by many of the things Moore claimed. It was hard for me to believe much of it, especially the things Charleton Heston said. I found out why these things were so hard for me to believe by visiting the site: http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html"
1,"It is worth seeing, but Michael Morre missed the point","He thought the columbine incident was about gun control. It was not. It was about anger and bullying. That is the problem. That is what would have fixed that problem. We need to help children be better to eachother or problems like this will keep going on. It is worth seeing because it is interesting, but he is wrong on this one. Micahel Moore is a good director but people are not always right."
1,Take back the Oscar,This is not a documentary. Moore should be ashamed for profiting off of this tragedy.
3,a mixed bag,"Moore lands some good punches here and there with this film, but there are numerous elements which are contrived and misleading. For example, the scene at the beginning in which Moore gets a gun from a bank was staged. Moore deceived the bank about his intentions in making that scene and arranged it ahead of time. Many of the statistics presented are misleading, not false, but presented in such a way so as to give an impression which is not true. This film is worth watching, but definitely should be approached with great caution by those seeking to understand the issues involved."
5,entertainment with a message,"Not everyone appreciates Michael Moore's sense of humor, and his political views are far from subtle. If you are angered by people who don't worship America, guns, and private property, your will find this film very annoying. Me, I think it's a classic."
4,We Are Not Amused,"There are times when Moore is kind of funny, in that cringe-at-the-embarassing-moment kind of way, and there are many, many more times when his holier-than-thou, we-are-the-world pontificated just wears thin.I was sucked in by the hype of ROGER & ME and then found it dull and less than informative, and I have to admit that I was sucked in for a second time on BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. Once again I was misled. Moore does mocumentary humor a lot better than the self-agrandizing proselylizing he too often stumblers into.On the other hand, any film that can expose Charlton Heston and the NRA for what they are deserves at least 3 stars. Heston is exposed as a fraud and a carny. The lighter moments of the film warrant another star; Moore's own showboating--the final moment of the Heston interview, where he props a photo of a shooting victim in Heston's courtyard, for instance--will make you want to throw up."
1,Garbage....pure garbage,"Watched it out of curiosity, more because of Moore's publicity whoring at the Oscars - and I was not impressed. They give Oscars for this garbage????Too many editorial liberties were taken in the production of this ""film"" - such as the hack & slash editing of pieces involving Charlton Heston. More time should've been spent on the ""whys"" of Columbine, and not on the blame game.Not a fan of Moore's politics, but I thought I would give it a chance - big mistake. I think Moore seems to think that each and every white male in America should go and apoligize to each and every disinfranchised group in this country....."
5,This movie deserves 10/5,"Words can't describe my love of this movie. It's Funny, and touching at the same time. This is definitly my favorite movie. About 20 mins in, though, there is some disturbing footage of people getting shot(and KILLED), but Just ignore that part :)TEN STARS!"
1,He seems to have issues with the truth,"The first time I saw this movie I was amazed. He painted a very grim picture...and I was surprised at some of the ""truths"" he pointed out. Unfortunately, after hearing other people question his veracity, I checked some of his ""facts""...and it looks to me that when he does not outright lie, he twists the truth. Before you believe everything that he (or I) says, check his facts for yourself. Google can be a very useful tool for this."
2,meh,"I watched it objectively and I admit, it's entertaining. However, I didn't blindly accept what he tried to reveal. Only because I had my third eye open and saw every trick he tried to pull. Moore is a cleaver documentary filmmaker...but not a great one."
1,Horrid example of propaganda,"Do not pay money for this production. Do not support Michael Moore. He scripts dialogue and passes it off as interviews. He deliberately brainwashes his constituents.Don't believe me? Did the Pilgrims really jump off their ship and immediately start shooting Native Americans? No. But after watching the cartoon, what's the first image that will pop into your head when you think about it? (""I loves my gun... Loves my gun..."")What was the purpose of a cash refund for the bullets? They quite obviously worked! And what was ""won"" at K-Mart? Nothing!How does 11,000 gun-related deaths per year (I won't even check the figures) suddenly become 11,000 murders? What about self-defense situations, accidents, suicides? Michael Moore is trying to convince you that American is cuture of paranoia. It isn't, but it may be if people keep listening to this idiot.Do yourself a favor and research gun control and crime statistics yourself, rather than wasting time with *Bowling for Columbine*."
1,Best Fiction,"I give it 1 star because zero is not an option. Moore's colection of out of context and out of sync ""quotes"" does a disservice to the idea of a documentary. He started out with an axe to grind and when the facts did not line up with his preconceptions, he simply made things up. I do not recommend buying it, but should you actually watch it, just notice how the clips are broken up. Then notice that the speaker is dressed one way at the beginning, and another after the break. Pieces are spliced together to portray something that never actually happened. Actually, Minus 5 would be an appropriate rating."
1,Mock-umentary!,"This movie is Liberal, Hollywood garbage. Moore distorts the facts and statistics, then expects American to believe. The sad thing is, he's conviced many weak minded people to back is anti-gun, anit-American views. Very sad."
1,how is fiction a documentary?,"avoid...not because you disagree with his politics, but because this is presented as a documentary but unfortunately it is in fact a persuasive propaganda piece. moore has good underlying intentions, in that he would like to see the eradication of gun violence in this country. too bad that this slickly edited, emotionally tweaking piece is almost wholly based in fiction starting at the part of the movie : 'history of the united states'. but you will like this if you think that white males are the reason that everything is wrong with this country...if you are like any intelligent person however, and realize that the usa is the best country in the world largely because of the historic contributions of the average white male then you would rather flush this one then watch it."
3,Question what you see,"This is pure left wing [***]. Moore, for the most part, manipulates and lies throughout the whole movie. He distorts the truth to fulfill his agenda, that being to trick naive people into thinking they've just been enlightened by his movie, which in turn, word of mouth spreads, making him more and more money.There's not even a purpose to this movie. Why does he harass Charlton Heston and the NRA when in this movie, he concludes in the end that they are not to blame? He thinks violent video games and movies are not to blame as well, but he contradicts himself in the end by blaming the American media. He doesn't find a solution or the causes of the problem, he justs flashes a bunch of ridiculous fairy tales on the screen.With all that being said, I'll still give it 3 stars because there are some funny parts to it. But I seriously hope people that watch this question the ""facts"" that this movie shows and realize that they're being misleaded."
3,An interesting point of view,"This is typical Michael Moore material (whatever that means to you), and Moore is to be applauded for tackling this obviously very touchy subject."
1,Trying again,"I guess we know the stance this website takes (far to the left) as this is the second review ive written about the piece of socialist garbage (the first one has not been admitted to this site) and i doubt this one will be allowed either. Perhaps if children were guarded as closely as the media, columbine may not have occured."
1,THE BLAME GAME,INSTEAD OF BLAMING KMART FOR SELLING BULLETS TO HTE KIDS WHO SHOT UP THEIR SCHOOL HOW ABOUT FOCUSING ON THIER PARENTS FOR NOT KEEPING THE GUNS AWAY FROM THIER CHILDREN IN THE FIRST PLACE AND GUN CONTROL IN GENRAL? MOORE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON THOSE PROBLEMS. AND IT WASN'T A REAL DOCUMENTRY IT WAS SCRIPTED.
1,Bowling For Columbine,"There are many problems with not only the facts of the movie, but also the editing, and the rambling done by the film's director, Michael Moore. In the end the film was way too long and the film contradicted itself more times than it didn't. Moore gives no answer to certain problems that the U.S. has, but instead many - and they all contradict each other. He seems to take every chance he has to put down the U.S. and exagerates the problems that it has. I would say that this film is also anti-American, but constructive criticism has always been a very American thing to do. However, this criticism is not constructive but instead somewhat nutty. Moore seems to enjoy hearing himself talk. I think he has more personal problems than the U.S. has as a country. Perhaps his next film should be about how he has turned out the way he has?"
1,Misleading and un truthful,"bottom line, the bank he got the gun from doesnt actually have guns on site. Thier ""vault"" is off site. This was a clever editing trick meant to decieve. Also about half way though the movie he basically proves that guns arent the problem, people are. However he keeps harping on guns.I enjoyed the movie, but think for yourself. Moore is a deceptive person."
1,A total waste of time,"this (ahem) film was a waste of my time and Michael Moore is a perfect example of a waste of a good set of organs ,as far as being as film maker. No talent shown in this one, in my opinion. Boring and cliche type style. Ive seen better documentarys and more intriguing displays of style and talent at the local community college film class ( freshman level). ( no offense to any freshmans in CC)DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE !disclaimer > this is my opinion/review, yours may differ"
1,Garbage,More garbage from the Fat Boy.It is filled with lies and distortions.Watch it if you must but check the facts before believing this crap.
2,Please research,"I just want to say one thing. I was excited to view this movie, but before doing so I researched it a bit. I was more than a little concerned to find that the movie uses a number of deceitful techniques with editing to strengthen Mr. Moore's position. Before you watch this film, I think it's good to research it a bit, then go in with open eyes. I hope this will help some of you."
5,Why do people say it's about gun control?,"I think it's interesting how people who see this movie come out saying that it's about gun control. It's interesting because they didn't watch the movie, they simply tuned it out due to their ridiculous misconceptions (and since Moore isn't too popular, they probably had to go out of their way to even see this film). I will agree that the issue of gun control was confronted as one of the many possible reasons for violence in this country. Ultimately, though, Moore shows this to be highly unlikely. Yes, Moore himself argues against guns being the reason for so much violence in this country. Micheal Moore is a genius and he presents his arguments in a valid fashion. Not only is this movie informative, but it may well be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time."
2,Lack of balance leads to lack of credibility.,"In short, the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across as it should do in making people aware of the high crime rate in the USA and the fact that this is in great part due to all the weapons that are out there. At the same time, however, it does not provide a balanced examination, which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create.Lying about being a member of the NRA to get an appointment in order to play ""tricks"" on Charlton Heston in an attempt to humiliate one of America's best actors is neither witty nor wise when trying to carry out a ""noble cause"".A more balanced and objective approach with less bias and closed mindedness would have made the film more effective and therefore, more successful. The ultimate goal is good, but the method used is not necessarily the correct one."
1,i'm not impressed with this movie AT ALL,"when i saw this film , i thought to myself ""are those two kids mad! , they should have been arrested by the colorado policefor trying to even pull those damn shootings""to summarize my short review : Bowling for columbineis a boring ,ignorant ,PATHETIC, COCKY documentary,that no one in their right damn mind will see or farenheit BECAUSE IT STINKS Like heck , it makes it look like a news special than a featureIN OTHER WORDS, THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS FILM"
2,Do Not Trust This Man,"Michael Moore made what I thought was an entertaining, fact-filled documentary. As it turns out, a lot of his ""facts"" are unfounded and in some cases completely made up.Read David T. Hardy's Truth About Bowling for Columbine article for more information.Next time, Moore, get your facts straight and I'll be more convinced."
1,Horrible Lies,"This movie is nothing but pure lies and distortions. The entire segment with Heston is one big edit job. Heston a racist? The man marched with MLK. Moore's European figures on gun shot victims are much lower then the actual figures. He skips over the European countries that require that their citizens have guns, yet have much lower crime rates. Some how he thinks that comparing a country with a minority population of 12-13 percent, is equal to a country that is over 30 percent minority. He gives no per capa figures, which is all that really matters anyway. He completely ignores the fact that the safest states in America to live are the ones with the least minorities, and most laxed gun laws. He presents this little boy who was very violent, had already stabbed one child before the shooting, and has since stabbed another as the victim of loose gun laws. Pass on this movie. Take the 10 minutes to research the info for yourself, rather then believe what some(one else) has to say."
1,Just Dumb,"You can read all the other reviews for synapsois and analysis, but as far as entertainment value, this movie sucks. It tries to hard to pack political points."
1,Don't be fooled,"Michael Moore's pathetic excuse for a documentary is nothing but political propaganda. Like Fahrenheit, 9/11 Michael Moore is simply capitalizing on American tragedies. I, for one, am ashamed that we, the American public, make people like this rich by buying and watching his ""documentaries""."
1,Waste of time,"For educational value, these 2 hours may captivate a small percentage of people who are otherwise unaware of the political issues surrounding gun control. Unfortunately, it is very one-sided, and a conservative filmmaker could easily put together a film in rebuttal.For entertainment value, this film had none. It wasn't funny (despite many reviews) and it primarily focused on American tragedies, which shouldn't be considered entertainment.Don't waste your time or money."
5,This movie isn't only about gun control,"It is also about asking the question ""What makes the United States such a violent and fearful nation?"".The most eye-openingsequence in the movie(at least for me)is when Micheal goes toCanada.He interviews people and discovers that Canadians don'tlock their doors.He goes house to house in Toronto and opens door after door.People seem more relaxed about things up there.This movie is frequently funny,moving,and thought-provoking.Some other reviews are quick to denounce this movie.But to methis just proves how great this movie is.It deserves all theawards it received!"
1,another fine mocumetary by michael moore,"htis movie should be subtitledlies and the lying liar that tells themmichale moore has NEVER let the truth getting in the way of his ""film making"" his life has been at the expense of others m isery...roger and me--layoffs of gm workedscolumbine- death/murderfaren 9/11 - even more death and murderthere are entire websites devoted to his un-fairy tales....and NO i am not a member of NRA...which liberal fools will start screaming...etc...etc...if you enjoy garbage you will love this film, and others M Moore has spewed out....enough said"
1,mockumentary,"if this is what hollywood considers an award worthy ""documentary"" , why wasnt spinal tap given an oscar.one lie after another. one 1/2 truth followed by a twisted situation. this movie is as much a documntary as star wars is."
2,"A man's sad attempt to be ""controversial""....","This movie will be well loved by people who are closed minded left wingers. Unfortunately he lost me in his attempts to draw conclusions through truly in-direct premises. Stating that a missile plant has something to do with the absolutely horrific events that took place at the high school is just... well... stupid... He paints the picture that he wants to paint... which is completely biased... The interviews he conducts are all very well planned with the complete intention to try and make the viewer agree with his opinions... The representatives he chooses for his opposition are ignorant and extreme... He takes conversations, events, etc... and very nicely pieces them all together in his own context... I was really looking forward to this movie but to my dismay it was just a pretty piece of propaganda... Well, better luck next time... One piece of advice... if you do watch this, try to watch it using your own mind to form its own opinions..."
5,yep yep,"see, now i told you that marilyn manson wasnt, so bad. c heston either makes himself look bad or it was all due to clever editing. he is a not so very caring person. yes, the nra has right but during the griving period of columbine they should have shown the compashion that americans are known for by having their convention else where. kmart is the best ""can i get a price check on a semi automatic. price check please on register 9 this 12 yr old isnt sure how much it is"""
4,Fine Documentary,"3/18/07 Film maker ,Michael Moore does a fine job in displaying the tragic realities present when weapons are accessible ""in that"" all owners of weapons are not ""mild mannered"" such as actor Charlton Heston."
5,A film not for all,"Many have said that this is merely manipulating trash. However. What this film has is a scary thing that most films today are lacking....gasp, a opinion. A view. A point. Yes, this is Michael Moore's own voice, but it's a voice that screams for those of us who can't. It uses fiction and fact to make an entertaining piece of film that gives you some information has well. Yes, Roger & Me was great, but let's face it. It was a bit boring, that's what this movie picks up on. By giving the facts a exciting look, Moore draws in more people to educate. It may have fiction, but fact lives in fiction."
5,Full of emotion,"While I dont agree with all of Moore's theories, he does put out a good documentary. He shows the fear that Americans feel and their love for guns. The film is both funny and sad at the same time. The movie makes you think and is interesting to watch."
3,People please,"I have never read so many idiotic reviews in my life. One star reviewers rarely eclipse 8th grade English skills while five star reviewers seemingly cannot think for themselves. Ignorance ='s Bush people. Watch the movie, it is interesting if nothing else."
4,Better late to the party than never,"After seeing the movie three times, taking my kids to it (covering the younger's eyes at certain parts), spouting from rooftops about its excellence and buying the dvd as soon is it was released. . .I just now get to this part. Okay, call me swifty.Much has been made about Moore's somewhat overbearing speech on Oscar night. Too much emphasis has been placed on whether or not he altered parts to make his point, what a true documentary is (as though we're all suddenly a nation of experts on the subject)and yadda, yadda, yadda.Moore can juxtapose humor and pathos so beautifully and in such a way that you're entertained and frightened. Nobody else does this, and without the entertainment piece of it, nobody would be watching it. That would be a crime.Let's boil it down, folks: this is a damn good, effective film of whatever sort you wish to categorize it that makes people think and, better still, talk."
5,Don't trust the people that hated this movie,"I've noticed almost all the reviews on here of people that hated the movie probably did not actually see it. Anyone who wrote something about ""gun control"" probably did not even watch a trailer. There is no way you can come out of this movie thinking about gun laws. There are plenty of mediocre reviews of this movie from people who actually watched it and who like to nitpick everything to death, but basically this movie can change your whole outlook on life for the better if you are smart enough to understand the message. The NRA should love this movie, it gives no reasons to change gun laws, but plenty of reasons to change their spokesman."
1,Moore is a joke,Normally documentaries are based on fact and not fiction. I guess when the facts don't agree with your left wing agenda you can just make stuff up and be rewarded by hollywood.
1,"I like Moore, but why does he have to >lie< to make his point","I was very, very disappointed with this documentary. It largely consists of editing tricks (lies) to make its point. Example:In one of the Heston speeches, it appears Heston is telling the Columbine mayor ""too bad"" in response to the tragedy. In reality, if you look carefully, HESTON'S TIE CHANGES COLOR SEVERAL TIMES during the speech. Hmmm. Why? Because Moore is editing together multiple speeches/ random phrases, from many different cities, to give the ILLUSION of a single speech. Moore is not showing us a real speech. He's showing us a >fake speech< that he wrote himself & using Heston like a puppet.Why does Moore have to create fake speeches to make his point? Why lie? It makes no sense."
1,Somebody please stop him,"Had to see this for a class, I just couldn't stomach it. Based on lies and half truths, even the title. (It refers to, as Moore says, that the shooters at Columbine went bowling before they shot up their high school, they didn't) This is almost but not quite as stilted as Roger & Me."
4,"entertaining, but biased","I found this movie to be quite interesting with all the unusual facts Michael Moore states. I don't know how much of it to believe or ignore because I know for sure Moore has no idea about the middle east and believes all the rulers there are dictators by stating ""dictator of Kuwait."" If that's the case would he call queen Elizabeth a dictator because both countries are democratic monarchies? I am not sure about other facts but this just made me skeptical about the validity of his other comments."
1,The Documentary that Wasn't,"Folks, please DO NOT accept this film as anything but a farce. Those who gush over this piece of fiction are not digging deeply enough. Drop ""truth about bowling"" into any search engine to see what really lies under the surface."
1,Utter Tripe,"The movies is a collection of lies, falsities, and half truths. This is not a documentary, a Documentary shows facts, provokes thought, and allows viewers to formulate their own opinions with all present facts.This contains no facts, just a large amount of biased anti-gun rhetoric spliced with fancy video editing. Watch and be amazed as peoples ties, hair styles, and clothing changes during supposedly continuous speeches. Listen in awe as both dates, and locations are blatantly lied about.This isn't a documentary, heck, it isn't even good television."
4,Joseph from Ohio,"Joseph,Should the Iraqi man that lost his whole family to one of our bombs also thank us. Would you thank us? Get a clue, maybe she had a point."
5,Opened my eyes! Amazingly Simple Movie!,"I'm sure I'm only adding to the scores of reviews that rave about this incredible movie. Opened my eyes to the problem in USA with attitude and guns. Love the animated part of the film. I do indeed rate it as a documentary and it deserved the awards. Michael Moore himself is pretty unassuming but his thoughts and direction are most most thought-provoking.You must see this film, if only to argue all the points that you thought Michael was wrong about!"
1,Fictional work at best,How can this be accepted for anything other than a weak piece of fiction when Moore readily admits to taking editorial privilages in manipulating the footage and facts to agree with his distorted view of America. The Wall Street Journal even exposed the lies and hypocrisy of Moore's film. Please spend of few minutes and Google the facts behind this travesty.
1,"Hey Mike, Check your facts","This isnt a documentary, its entertainment using the Columbine tradegy for shock value and attention. C'mon Mike, you coulda made this without invoking a horrific event. The scenes with Charlton Heston prove waht a nut Mike is, have some respect man...."
1,Full of Half-Truths and Publicity Stunts,"At the very least, a documentary should be factual. Any amout of research will uncover Moore's distortion of events to promote his far left agenda. This is true of his movies and his fantasy book ""Stupid White Men."""
1,Popularity amongst hollywood does not equal reality,"After all the hype on how great this guy was I thought why not see this film. In the end I was left with the same thoughts after seeing the NSDAP (Nazi) and Soviet Cold War Films. Total bias and one side story telling. Dont bother with truth and objectivity. Clearly things are one sided and edited in such a way to protray his views. This is not a documentary but rather is progapanda just as KKK films or NeoNazi films are. All sway their views with facts, but facts from only one side. I really wonder about the education and objectivity of society today, a society that blesses this film. Wow. I agree with Gilberts post, this film sucks, but it is valuable to see, so that you can be reminded of how easy it is to sway millions with mere pictures and words like a magicians sleight of hand.-Remy"
1,A work of fiction,"From the title on this is a pure work of fiction. Michael Moore rewrites history and edits and splices audio and text freely to portray people as saying things that they never said. He staged scenes and presented them as candid shots. In his attempt to denigrate America he lies about everything from the year that the KKK was founded to the text on a B-52 memorial at the Air Force Academy to the sattelite launch vehicles built in Littleton. It is very telling that he can not make his case based on facts, and is forced to resort to fiction while claiming it to be a documentary. He portrays gun owners as ignorant fearmongers, but ultimately the joke is on his intended audience who accept his fiction as fact and buy into his own fearmongering."
1,Another Blame It On ....for Moore,"Just like America, lets put the blame on something other than the real problem."
5,ignorance is death,"I wish I was shocked by the appaling reviews of Michael Moore's film, but I am not. The bad reviews are sent in by the exact same life time members of the NRA that Moore was trying to get through to. It's sad that the people who need to be enlightened the most are also the ones who are the least likely to become so.I thought this film, although perhaps inacurate in some facts had a great intention and a powerful message. Every child in america should watch this film and only then will they be able to make a real decision on what they think is right with regards to gun law and the constitution."
4,nomdeplum,"your a moron, guns are bad, people kill people, but so do guns. lets make an amendment to ban ownership of weapons of mass destruction. oh wait a gun isnt a weapon of mass destruction. it killed my brother. and my family wasnt massively destroyed... i pray for us all."
5,raw,"The only other film out there like this is Supersize me! They are both in a league of their own and a must for anyone whowants to see non-Disney versions of the USA.Bowling For Columbine is worth the money for the interviewwith Charlton Heston alone. The footage with Heston is a pure, raw exposition of Heston's opinion as Leader of the NRA. There can be no mistake: Moore simply asked the questions, put a mic in front of the man and Heston did the rest.Don't let anyone tell you that this film lies or that's it's full of untruths or that Moore twists the truth. He just puts a mic in people's faces and they tell the story. If you think the people in the film are liars, that's up to you, but listen for yourself and keep in mind who's doing most of the talking.The volume of reviews of this film and the venom with which people attack Moore are enough to tip anyone off that Moore has brought up an issue that matters to all Americans and that is as sensitive as religion, patriotism, or racism."
1,Liberal Propiganda,This is just a bunch of liberal propiganda comeing from an anti american socialist nut. Love it or leave it never rang more true.
2,Meanspirited,"The scene that did it for me in Michael Moore's well done film involved an interview with a police officer about someone who dressed a dog up as a hunter and was accidentally shot. Funny? Yes. Demeaning? Yes again.Moore makes numerous valid points throughout his film. But, too often, for my taste, he does it by ridiculing someone. He does it politely, but not without meanness. And that is why I was uncomfortable with watching the film. And that is why I am rating this film low."
5,guns don't kill people?,"This film, flawed as it may be (mostly in the eyes of its detractors), once again must confront the blatantly inane axiom that ""guns don't kill people."" Guns DO kill people; and the people who use them are the cowards that stand behind them. The American Rifle Murderers and others of their ilk try to hide behind a Second Amendment that is now outdated historically and morally. And their gun lobbying and support have produced not only Columbine but the most recent tragedy in Virginia (2007). MIchael Moore should be applauded and lionized as a humorist with a true grit kick. What he says in this film is played out in this free (to die) society on a daily basis."
1,"VERY entertaining, but not factual at all.","Moore is clearly a good filmmaker. Unfortunately, he is also an implicit liar. His movies are presented as documentaries; that is, documenting facts. This one, at least, is nothing but distortion after bias after distortion. It has been thoroughly debunked by others already, so there's no need for me to go into the errata (for those curious, a quick search for ""Bowling for Columbine debunked"" will reveal some very well-researched treatises).If you're looking for entertainment, Moore delivers in spades. What he does not deliver is journalism or integrity. As a work of fiction, I'd give this movie five stars. As a documentary, zero."
2,Documentary NOT.,"I enjoyed this film. It was at times very funny. It is NOT a ""documentary"" however. Many of his figures are misleading.The PLUS: Raises the question of the amount of fear that is generated in American society and the role the media plays in that hysteria. FEAR & CONSUMPTION.The NEGATIVE: His conclusion that a society so fearful should not have guns. The kind of conclusion that plays right into the hands of a government nature that would exterminate us all.""Gun Control"" is the greatest untruth in the face of determination."
1,This Is Not A Documentary,"I'm afraid that this Oscar-winning ""documentary"" is a farce. A documentary is true - this film is not. It is scripted, it is spliced together, and it was obviously made to push an agenda. Please do some background research before you waste your time on this DVD - you'll find that Michael Moore made a fictional film to promote his own radical beliefs. Don't waste your time. Mr. Moore obviously doesn't have his ""finger on the pulse of America."""
1,Bowling for Columbine,"Slanted missguided rubbish. What more is there to say? Maybe he could have covered the ""other"" side of the story as well? How about documenting and analyzing burglary levels and murders in countries that have gun control? Criminals don't obey laws anyway, they always find ways to have guns. Of course gun control is a liberal policy, which as we all know, ""liberal policies when implemented generate the exact opposite of their stated intent!"""
2,Somewhat Frustrating to Watch,"I just saw this movie recently, and found it frustrating to watch because so many of Moore's conclusions are transparent. He has a tendency to ask a completely pejorative question in an interview, and then cut to a new scene without letting his subject answer. He focuses most of the first half of the movie on Lockheed Martin, a defense contracting company in Colorado, and I don't see the connection between Lockheed and guns in schools. This movie requires critical analysis on the part of the viewer, because Moore's strategy seems to be to throw every argument (no matter how farfetched) at the viewer and see what sticks."
5,Cognitive Dissonance,"It is easy to be afraid when reality is different than your deeply held belief systems. Its called cognitive dissonance and it is what happens when fanatics bump into reality. They become frightened and confused. This movie is very real and it is consequently deeply disturbing to people that have already their minds made up that nothing is wrong in America. But things are wrong in America and Mr. Moore is holding up the mirror. Not because he hates America, but because he loves America and wants us to make decisions based on facts instead of assumptions and gut feelings. BRAVO for the most thought provoking movie of the decade. My 78 year old Republican mother stole my copy and gave it to her minister. Ding, Dong, Jr Bush is doomed by his own behavior when flushed into the light. Freedom is just 6 months away."
2,michael moore shoots himself in the foot,"as usual, michael moore undercuts himself by refusing to accept that a 45 minute documentary should not run two hours. theres alot of great stuff here (the interview w marilyn manson, the interview w trey parker, &c), but too often moore inserts himself into a story others should be telling, no more so than in the vile segment where he goes to visit charlton heston. i agree with many, nay most of moores politics -- but hes a rotten filmmaker with some great ideas but awful execution."
1,A Miserypimp at Work,"This self-appointed Messiah of the Left is all about making lots of money, thereby further distancing himself financially from those whom he ""serves"". DVD is pure rubbish."
1,If Only Moore Would Have Produced A Documentary,"That this film is still being called a ""documentary"" is a slap in the face of those who produce documentaries. Moore has very artfully packaged political commentary and sold it as ""truth"". If you Google around the web, you'll find many examples of how Moore massaged his message and staged this flick to conform to his beliefs.If you think this film is ""truthful"" you must also believe Stone's ""JFK"" is factually correct."
1,Very distasteful!! Don't waste your money.,"This movie starts out with an exaggeration and goes downhill from there. Moore is capitalizing on the death of the Columbine children and the child in Michigan. He remixes speeches and adds words to what was said, he makes up timelines to fit his agenda.The movie is NOT a documentary, but a work of fiction, based on fact (TV movie style).It is appalling that it was allowed to be shown as a true storyline.Don't waste your money on this pack of mistruths and self-serving editing."
3,Pure sugar for left with no substance,"Mr. Moore continues his tradition of manipulation and fabrication giving a historic background to the myth of his propaganda. Moore has more faith in himself than trut and no respect for the American people, which he has labeled while in Europe as uneducated, gullible and overall as worthless. Any other question of why he wins accolades in France? Buy real documentaries and leave Moore in his own world with the rally gullible people who believe his sewerage."
2,If only the government had all the guns...,"Mr. Moore's depressing documentary shows his extreme anti-gun philosophy while feigning humility. Although the incidents covered are tragic, the root causes of these problems are not exposed. The NRA is ultimately blamed, but the significance of this connection is marginal."
5,Brilliant,"A wonderful documentary exposing the terrible state of gun control/misuse in the united states. Moore doesn't have all the answers, but he definitely makes you sit up and take notice."
5,"Shoot first, ask questions later.",A great look at the nature of fear and violence in America. Funny. Sad. Disturbing. I saw this film 4 times in the theater. Each time bringing a new set of friends. All walking away enlightened and a little ashamed.
3,mixed feelings.,"This is certainly a great movie to watch to spark your emotions and inspire debate. But there are a lot of things wrong with it, which I'm sure other reviewers have already pointed out. However...it's also got some extremely hilarious parts. I thought the interviews were all well edited in the sense that it makes anyone who doesn't agree with Moore look like a total jackass. While that's not what I like to see in a documentary, it IS pretty funny."
1,Not funny at all,"The kindest thing I can say about this particular movie is that it suffers from a lack of the truth. It attempts to blame everyone from the Lockheed Corporation to the NRA for the sudden upswing in school violence over the years, and it fails rather miserably. The editing is done in such a way that the true message of some who appeared in it (like Charlton Heston, for example) is completely twisted around. Overall, I'd say save your money and get this from your local library. If you've spent the money, then get a refund."
1,Documentary???!!!,"While this film might have some value if marketed as the op-ed piece it is, presenting it as a documentary is just as misleading as many of the bits of misinformation that the director presents as facts. Even during the filming of the piece Michael Moore misled some of the movie's participants, then showed their ""opinions"" out of context and contrary to their true feelings. There is plenty of this kind of deception on the networks, why bother renting/buying it when it's the same drivel you can get for free every evening?"
1,Political opportunism,"Moore uses the tragedy of Columbine to promote himself and his extreme political views. Large portions of the program contain completely unrelated diatribes like the animated overview of ""American History"" (He comes to the conclusion that America is rich today because it practiced slavery!)"
1,What a farce,"This ""documentary"" should be called a propagandamentary. Everyone who praises this film should watch it again. This time turn off the sound and emotions and just watch Heston's tie. You might feel ""had"".I must assume the only reason this film won an oscar is because the nominating commitee never saw it."
1,Too bad he embelishes and alters,So Michael Moore wants to do a left-biased show about gun control. Would have been better had he not altered a few facts and done some horrendous editing of Heston's speeches.
1,Documentary or fiction?,"Micheal Moore presents his views in this documentary. Through use of editing (leaving out the parts that disagree with his view) and the presentation of ""skewed timeframes"" (the Heston speech was made more than 5 months later) Moore presents a case that makes people see what he wants and not what is really there. To call this a documentary is a bit of a stretch and for it to win an Oscar under best documentary was very disappointing. Please when coming out of the movie, find some facts for yourself and make up your own mind. Shame on you Mr. Moore."
1,total nonsense,highly edited piece of total nonsense by a radical left wing canadian who hates the usa yet still finds the time and energy to make a ton of money by criticizing it ... this review applies to all of his movies . i hope that if he does get sick he gets his care in his beloved cuba ....good luck
5,Great Job!,"I wished that people would watch this movie and would never buy a gun again. But unfortunately people don't change.This was a great movie, but what do you expect from Michael Moore a bad movie? He is a genius film maker with lots of courage and a perseverance that makes him even more unique."
3,its ok,I think some of the messages in this movie are good but some arent. I like how he understands the struggle black people been goin thru but sum people need guns. I grew up in the hood in harlem and my daddy had a gun to protect my family from the gangs. But he locked up the gun and told me never to touch it and I never did. I think you should be able to have a gun if you want to but you should teach your kids to stay away from it. And anyway whyd you need a gun a gun if you live in the burbs. Im pissed tho cuz 1 guy said canada has less crime cuz theres less black people if I see that guy Ill kick his racist a**. Black people aint all violent and anyone who says we are can rot in hell. At least the black people who kill do it for money or drugs instead of the white people who kill for fun.
4,informative,"This documentary is informative, even if flippant, showing us how America has a violent society unlike any other. Even my Columbian friend who is a teacher here says that the violence in our schools is unlike anything she saw in Columbia (where there has been a civil war for 40 years). It is important to understand our culture of violence so that we can work to dismantle it."
1,Forced to give 1 star.,"I really wanted to rate this film 0 (zero), but there is no such option.I will probably anger a lot of people from the left, but I must say that you should check the facts before you label Charlton Heston a racist for his comments about ""mixed ethnicity"" being responsible for gun violence in the USA. About 50% of murders in America are committed by blacks even though they make only about 12% of the total population. Murder rate among blacks is 7-8 times higher than among whites. Michael Moore did not include this troublesome information in his movie and in my opinion such an omission disqualifies it as a documentary."
1,Just another looking for a purpose.,"I forced myself to watch this entire documentary in the interest of objectivity. My opinion remained unchanged from the start to finish. Michael Moore attempts to capitalize on a combination of one of the most unfortunate incidents in US history and an age-old opposition by a portion of the population to guns. Anybody can do what Michael Moore did in this documentary, accuse the NRA for the shootings in America. Come on Michael...anybody with any level of insight understands there is much more to the problem. Even my gun-fearing activist friends were embarrased at his cheap tactics and his simplistic view of the subject. Narrow-minded anti-gun activists...buy the film. Michael Moore obviously needs the money and attention. The rest of us have better uses for our money."
2,Not Great!,"Only ordered this movie because it was a requirement of ENG102. I think the movie was just ok. It seems bias in many areas although it does make you stop to wonder how much the media really does play with our minds. I know the media only tells us what they want us to hear, to buy the products they want us to buy, etc. Movie wasn't that bad, just a touchy subject I suppose because it makes me angry how the media uses us (the public)."
5,Michael Moore's talent cannot be denied,"Regardless of your political stance, Michael Moore has become a force in this country, and beyond. To attempt to minimize his film by saying that this is NOT a documentary is very shortsighted, misleading, and just plain untrue. Moore really chucks away at Americana in a way that no one is able (or willing) to anymore in the cinema. Most of the American movie directors of today are scared to make subversive, thought--provoking films. They figure that Unviersal, Columbia, or 20th Century Fox will not supply them with some 100 Million bucks to throw away on some lousy Hollywood action or other fomula movie. With rare exceptions, all of those cookie cutter films are a waste of time and people's money. On the other hand, Mr. Moore is a real film maker, as he stated clearly at this year's Academy Awards. Bowling For Columbine has a few flaws (which is OK), and it makes a lot of people uncomfortable, and that's the way it should be. I hope he makes 50 more films!"
1,Lying For An Oscar,"Michael Moore is a disgrace to the left-wing society, much like George W. Bush is a disgrace to the right-wing society. ""Bowling For Columbine"" is a film that if it is taken seriously, the results are just laughable. The Columbine shootings weren't based on gun control, and the attackers didn't get their weapons legally either. Moore is just contradicting the second amendment and placing the blame on the firearms business. This isn't a documentary, it's a deceptive, biased, and opinionated hack job of a movie that Moore is shoving right into our faces. Weapons aren't a problem, humanity and lack of responsibility is the problem.Somebody give Moore a laxative, because he's so full of [sh]it when it comes to his ""documentaries""."
1,Horribly Inaccurate,"Moore has a unique ability to skew the truth to paint the picture he wants the world to see. He makes no sound arguments. All of his data is misleading and not correct. The biggest problem here is the misconception that Gun Control is Crime Control. If you research any of his facts with Federal Government's statistics on Gun related crime you will find huge disparities. In the U.S. the states with the highest crime rates are those who also have the toughest Gun Control laws. This movie might be good entertainment, but it is NOT a documentary for it relies on absolutely NO facts."
1,www.bowlingfortruth.com,"I watched the video, it was funny but some things did not seem right. I searched and found www.bowlingfortruth.com very informative."
1,He lost me early in the movie,"It took me a long time to get enough curiosity to even watch it the first time. If this ""documentary"" is Michael Moore's view of the world, then he needs therapy.He seems to only see the most negative aspects of people, and tries to prove his points with a form of analysis that completely evades me.Explain again how K-Mart was responsible for a couple of kids going on a murder spree? I guess that my family should go after Coors and Shell Oil if I get killed by a drunk driver. The drunk driver should not be held responsible for his actions, because Shell put gas in his car and Coors put alcohol in his blood...damn those evil corporations.He completely lost me with the references to Marilyn Manson, bowling, rocket motors and the NRA. Sort of like listening to a somebody saying: 1+1=3 get it?No, I don't get it."
3,Very Disturbing,"This was my first Dennis Cooper book. I had a very hard time getting through it. I actually put the book down several times, swearing I would not finish reading it. But I did want to know more about the main character, Ziggy. The subject matter is very dark and disturbing. I think what probably disturbed me most was the fact that someone had known enough about such deviant behaviors to write about them. The most difficult for me was reading about ""Uncle Ken"", a disgusting, overweight, child molester/pornographer. He truly made me feel sick to my stomach. But in the end, I did finish the book, which is why I gave it three stars. It's somewhat interesting if your can stomach it."
5,Disturbingly Beautiful.,"This is the third book of Cooper's that I have read (just finished actually...), and I am so moved I wanted to write a quick review. Cooper has this amazing ability to write about the most gruesome and chilling subject matter - things to horrific for most to even ponder- ,yet his characters are incredibly endearing and surprisingly easy to relate to. TRY is ultimately a love story, a tale of friendship and heartbreak, gorgeously written from the perspective of the varied main characters. A fascinating and touching read that I had a hard time putting down and would recommend to anyone."
2,Very Unusual,"This is my first Dennis Cooper book so it took me several pages to get use to his style of writing. At first I found this choppy style quite annoying; howerver, one I got into the book, it became easier to concentrate on the plot.I found the book disturbing simply because of the subject matter, child pornograpy, pedophilia, drug abuse, and necrophilia all wraped up in one. I guess my curiosy keep me reading this book to find out how this all would end. I can honestly say that this was not one of my favorite books."
3,A most non-Numan experience,"Appreciably, not one of Numans more traditional works, but a close read of his autobiography reveals why. At one of the lowest times of his career, dwindling finances and record company pressure gave birth to Machine and Soul. For Numan, things couldnt have gotten any worse, but retrospectively its still quite a tight sound. Nice production, smooth female backing vocals, and some cleverly-placed samples tie this somewhat average effort together quite nicely. Its major fault is that its just not Numan!"
4,machine and soul,"a bloody good album. not a weak song on it. up there with warriors. it all came together on this album. choiceof singles not to my liking or the punters.buy it , it won't dissapoint."
2,For Completists Only,"Gary Numan was obviously looking for direction by time this album came out - why else would he cover TWO Prince songs? Oddly, ""U Got the Look"" emerges as a decent track here. A few others - the title track, the ballad ""I Wonder"", and ""Cry"" are worth a listen or two as well. The rest of the album - enh."
1,Dissappointed,I am very disappointed in the purchase of the DVD The Perfect Nanny ... I CAN'T EVEN HEAR IT EVEN WITH THE TV TURNED UP . This was the only problem I have ever had with the many purchases I have made . VERY DISSAPPOINTED CUSTOMER
2,Rescue 911,It was not the TV Series I wanted. It had rescues alright. But William Schatner was not narrating it and the Rescue format was different. I was not happy with this product.
5,Relived my childhood through this old gem of a VHS,"When i was young, I used to watch Rescue 911 all the time and repeatedly get nightmares, but as I grew older and more fascinated by emergency management, I was looking for a copy of the show to be able to watch again--and since the main series is nowhere to be found in it's entirety, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this VHS."
5,Whoo-oo-oo-oo-hooh-hooh-oo!,"Besides the fact that this book has the greatest, grab-you-by-the-throat beginning I've ever seen, this book establishes Bulgakov in my mind as a giant - in Russian literature, alongside Gogol, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, and Solzhenytsin - and in 20th century literature. Don't let my name-dropping fool you - there is simply no one I can complare Bulgakov to. Who else can get inside the mind, as well as the heart of a dog as he is transformed in to a human-like creature after a gland graft. Blending sharp, piquant writing with pathos and svage satire, this book is a worthy companion to ""The Master and Margarita"". They sit together on my bookshelf (but never for too long)."
3,"Good story, bad translation","While there seemed to be a good story here, and it was mildly amusing (though I must admit I know only a little about Soviet Russian history), the translation (by Michael Glenny) was pretty bad. I found it very hard sometimes to follow what was going on, as the point of view seemingly kept changing around at will. Also, the edition I read would have been vastly improved had there been some way (typographically?) to separate out the dog's thoughts from the general narration--as it is they just run together, heightening the translation problems. I hear that the Ginsburg translation is much better, so you may want to read that version instead."
5,unsubtle rebuke?,"Censored by the state apparatus, there are a number of targets in this satire. As much a social satire in the vein of Metamorphosis or science Frankenstein; he concludes the base wants of food and beer are not so much different than the base wants of a respectable doctor- a large apartment. Power and control are are illustrated in several different ways."
4,Would have liked France,"Bulgakov's quibble with the Soviet authorities seems not to be that they have come to realise that the lower classes are ghastly, but that they ever supposed they could be anything else. I'm sure the dicky-bowed, monacled MB would have been happier as a Parisian boulavadier, aristo-emigre. Funny, decadent, thoroughly counter-revolutionary - its scarcely surprising he was supressed during his lifetime."
1,IT IS NOT A BOOK,"I was very disappointed when I received this in the mail, it was a play version of Heart of a Dog, not the novel I wanted. I called Amazon, because no where on here did it say that, even in the ""quick look"" it showed the novel. And after about 15 minutes of futile arguing (I wasn't going to give up) they let me return it. So BE AWARE THAT YOU MIGHT NOT GET THE NOVEL."
1,THIS IS NOT A BOOK BY BULGAKOV,"This is a dramatization written by Frank Galati and based on the book by Bulgakov. Bulgakov also wrote a play based on this story but this is not it. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE NOVEL ""HEART OF A DOG""!!!!"
1,Heart of a Dog,"Don't buy this edition! This is a terrible translation; neither the translator nor the original copyright date is listed. Poorly edited. Full of typos. The quality seems like that of a pirated publication. This is the first such purchase in many years that we discarded rather than to pass it along after reading.The novella, however, is worth reading, and Bulgakov wrote ""Heart of a Dog"" in a play version as well. Make sure the edition you purchase has an acknowledged/credited translator."
1,Stay away from this translation of Bulgakov's short masterpiece.,"A terrible (abominably bad!) translation set to slipshod do-it-your typography. I just got this book and was amazed that this undergraduate-level attempt to English Bulgakov's prose is sold on Amazon. The translator was fortunate not to have his or her name credited anywhere between the covers. Don't expect an introduction to the author or the work, either. This is a home-spun desktop project from from first page to last. My advice is to buy the wonderful Grove Press translation by Mirra Ginsburg. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802150594/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0R5KW2HQ29X3R1MZNX4W&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=470938631&pf_rd_i=507846. You'll save yourself a few bucks to boot if you buy it used. Enjoy the novel!"
3,Conflicted,The work itself is no doubt brilliant. My main complaint is with the shoddiness of the translation. It seems as though it had been translated by a computer and lacked a human's nuanced touch. There were also many typos which were somewhat distracting. I'd love to read this again by a different translator. This is referring to the edition with the ISBN 13 - ending in -0316
1,"Adapted Play, not novel","This is the adapted play, not the original novel, so please adjust the description accordingly, so other purchasers are aware of this. Additionally, my seller will not refund me the original shipping costs nor the return shipping costs as they ""shipped the correct item according to ISBN"" and Half.com wrote the review - they cannot change the review either. so, i'm out two shipping costs, and still did not get the correct gift! Totally sucks."
1,BUYER BEWARE: THIS IS THE PLAY VERSION,"This is NOT the novel by Bulgakov, but rather a rather short play interpretation. It says that NOWHERE in the description. Just a heads up."
3,Not at all a bad book,"The title says it all. ""Mr. Britling Sees It Through"" ... gosh, it's almost a parody of a H.G. Wells title. It's the story of how Mr. Britling makes it through World War One; although I should point out that he never once leaves England nor even, so far as I can remember, his study.Look, I really liked this book, and I wish I could give it a higher rating; and Wells is a good enough writer to ensure that the book has some good things in it (Mr. Britling's ""affair"" with a theatrically emotional woman is hilarious); but in all fairness I must say that (a) Not all that much happens - I know Mr. Britling has a son at the front, but the resulting tension isn't enough to build a novel out of, and (b) There's something a touch self-indulgent about Mr. Britling's armchair angst, and so as a result (c) Wells sometimes misses the point of his own fable. But if anyone has any desire at all to read this book, I say, give in to it."
3,So far so good,I've always appreciated these Klutz books and find this one good at addressing my timing problems. I haven't gotten too far into the book yet - my progress is slow - but I feel it has well lived up to its reputation and my expectations so far.
3,"Great lamp, challenging clamp!","I bought this lamp to replace the cheap one I bought at Walmart. It is a great lamp, it puts out great light, and they are easy to move without burning yourself. HOWEVER, assembling the clamp requires four hands, an engineering degree, and a couple of xanax! I finally gave up and set it on top of the cage minus the clamp. It's still a great lamp though."
4,Good Quality Product,These are good quality lamps at a fair price point. They do the job. Good product overall. I have used several other Fluker's products all ordered on Amazon and I'm very satisfied with their quality.
4,i thought he died!,"i couldnt believe when i read this book. i thought alex died! i couldnt believe it. i was shocked. anothony horowitz, you are amazing! everyone should read this, especially after reading scorpia!"
3,Nice....but.....,"This was a nice book, one of the first Anthony Horowitz - Alex Rider books I read, but it didn't live up to my expectations. The end was completely UNREALISTIC, what 14 year old goes into space? Astronauts train for years to go into space and then they decide that an untrained 14 year old boy should go into a space capsule and fly into space. Of course, this drastic decision happens in maybe 1 hour or 30 minutes. Overall, the beginning captured my attention and it was quite interesting. However I think I'll read the previous Alex Rider books to see if they are better than 'Ark Angel'."
3,Nothing Special... Especially For Anthony Horowitz,"I'm sorry to say this, but thus far, this is the worst book (with the exception of Storm Breaker) in the series. It is very predictable, and is also slow at times. Alex is still a good character, but everything else is nothing special. If you have read any of the other books in this series, you will know exactly what will happen."
5,Ark Angel Review,This was an awesome book because it had lots and lots of action and adventure so that it's pretty hard to get bored by the end of the book. So if you love action And adventure then this book is defiantly for you.
4,A Great Read,"I think this book was a tremendous book. The only thing was that it had a little to much describing, but oher than that I that book was one of the best books I've ever read.It is about a 14 year old boy who name is Alex Rider and he works with the MI16 which is a spy unit, who was wounded by being shot by a sniper in the left shoulder. The bullet was actually aiming for his heart until he stepped off a curb, it was that exact moment that saved his life. He was in the hospital for quite along time, actually o long. So he decided to sneak out and get a breath of fresh air. He was stopped by four men who came in and shot the receptionest in the head because they were looking for the boy in the next room to Alex. He out smarts all of the men even with a wounded arm, until he forgot about the driver who unexpectedly hit him and knocked him unconsious. The men then set him in a building and catch it on fire. You have to find out if he survives by reading the book."
4,Action Packed- Passion Writer 123,"Anthony Horowitz has done it again! Ark Angel, the final book in the Alex Rider series, is thrilling and captivating. I can say with no doubt there was an abundent amount of research used in order to give this novel not only thrilling but believable. However, despite the book's brilliance, Ark Angel was at times a bit over done. Nonetheless, Anthony Horowitz's final novel of the series was a success in my view."
4,WOW,I have read all the books of this series. This is really good. i mean i didnt like the ending much but besides that Anthony Horowitz is a great author.
2,Alex Rider Series jumps the shark . . .,"Some of the other Alex Rider books may have been a little predictable, but Ark Angel is by far the worst book in the series. As if someone with a cheesy tattoo of the world covering their head isn't bad enough, this book really ""jumps the shark"", not only does Anthony Horowitz yet AGAIN use the ""corrupt rich guy"" plot (this may have something to do with his childhood . . .), but at the end of the book Alex gets launched into space. Save your $15 and buy Maximum Ride by James Patterson or a Scott Westerfeld book instead."
4,Good not Great,This is the same classic Alex Rider adventure. One of the better ones in the series but Scorpia is still the best.
4,Non-Stop Action with a Sprinkle of Violence,"I got this book for my 12 year old son. He loves the Alex Rider series and was surprised to find another book....especially after the ending of the last one!!! He couldn't put the book down. He kept reporting all the violent events to me. He told me the book was predictable, but he'd recommend it anyway. I'm just happy that he's reading!!!"
3,"not the worst in the alex rider series,but certainly not the best",alexrider is a great series but this book is not that good.It is a little too overambitious[a teenager in space WAY TOO OVER AMBITIOUS]
5,Incredibly interesting and mentally stimulating book,"This book by Pam Benoit is a wonderful description of how people respond to success. This is a book that anyone who has experienced personal or professional successes will appreciate. Benoit describes the delicate process of balancing complimenting, bragging, modesty, and self-enhancement. Useful for individuals, businesses, and any other organizations who want to understand how to create a favorable impression when they describe their successes. It includes stories of athletes, Mary Kay consultants, and Nobel Prize Winners all in the context of intricate analyses of interpersonal accomplishments."
4,Special book,"This book on mills by David Macaulay was named by Yankee Magazine as one of the 100 Best New England books and I can see why. The illustrations are incredibly detailed and the text rich with details as well. Macaulay has obviously researched his subject in an exhaustive manner. If you are looking to learn about mills or supplement your history curriculum with additional information, this book could be just what you are looking for!"
5,History is fun,"Just about anything by this author makes history fun, learning a real experience, and picques a reader's curiosity. Students can be seen sitting quietly and reading."
4,Are you willing to take this journey?,"No easy road you will travel. But as you share Jan's experiences you will also share her strengths. No stranger to disappointment, Jan meets rejection and loneliness along the way but she has the courage to reach out and trust when others might not. What Jan finds at the end of the story is something that will not really surprise you as much as change you forever."
2,wtf!!!!,"I DON'T THINK I REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK. FRIST OFF THE MAIN CRATER WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE, HOMELESS, TO DRUGS THEN TO LOVE. I JUST DIDNT UNDERSTAND IT!AND THE ENDING JUST WAIT TIL YOU GET TO THE ENDING SMH...."
5,Girlbomb on Target,"When a writer can compel you to read on with seeming ease, when you can recognize something of yourself in each of her characters, when dialogue rings true every time, when the writing is clear and insightful, you know you're dealing with a genuine talent. Every page of this memoir of living on the streets of New York City in the 1980s rings true, and rings powerfully due to the forthrightness of Erlbaum in telling the details of her story, and her directness in expressing it.If I were all thumbs, I'd give it 10 thumbs up!"
4,Real,"I read this book a few years ago. I was stunned when I learned the real struggle of being on the street, especially in a big city. This book will definitely hold your attention. It is honest, raw, and sad. It is always a relief when the person is still around to write about it though. I told the author how much I liked her book and she actually replied, which I thought was pretty cool. For anyone looking for first-hand insight on what its like to be a homeless addict, I recommend this book. I think it is good to know that these are real people, and this is exactly the type of book that can shed light on the real problems so many teens face here in the U.S. A great read."
4,realistic,"I am 15 and when I read this book I couldn't get past the description of Janice's mother and stepfather. It was everything I had wanted to put into writing about my mother and stepfather but hadn't thought of the examples or gotten the dialogue down.Janice's book kept me hooked, from getting abused in the shelter to living in the group home to living with Sebastian to everything else. This was a great read and I liked reading about New York City, my fav place I have lived for 2years (and am moving back this summer)! Go Janice, luv the book xx"
3,It is what it is...,This book was ok to read. It seemed a little slow to me & a little average. But at the end of the day it's great to see/read about anyone making positive change in their lives.
5,Testament,"I am grateful for the witness that believing Christians can obtain and strengthen from this additional Testament of Jesus Christ.Nephi, Alma, Mormon and Moroni all become new witnesses along side Peter, Paul and John. The additional account of Jesus' ministry in the Americas after His resurrection is a calming, reaffirming credential to the truth of His life and mission, both mortal and immortal."
5,The Most Correct of Any Book on Earth!!!,"How many books do you know that claim to be delivered by an angel? To get a sacred record from the Heavens that was translated under the direction of God, is most rare. This book is a must for any library! It is a must for any home! It is a must for any family! When used with the Bible, this book will draw individuals, families, communities, and nations closer to God. It will help to answer some of life's truly difficult questions. It will aid each reader in drawing nearer to our Lord, Jesus Christ! It is sent of God! I love this book!!!"
4,Pros and Cons,"The Book of Mormon is not intended to be a novel, so if you are looking for some light reading, this isn't it. Neither is the Bible, however. Yes, there are some interesting parts, and yes there are exciting parts, but compared to a bestselling fictional book, this is a bit slow. But if you are willing to spend some time thinking about what you are reading and want to look at the Old and New Testaments in a fresh light, this is for you.If you want to get into all the arguments about whether the Book of Mormon can be squared with archaeology and other fields of study, you probably want to go tohttp://www.farmsresearch.com/or tohttp://www.fairlds.orgOtherwise, just read the book and think about it. I did and it changed my life for the good."
1,This religion ruins lives ...,"I believed everything the Mormon church taught and read this book like a diligent Morgbot and I've gotten nothing. It ruined my life as long as I let it - bad Mormon marriage, loss of college scholarship, loss of jobs, etc. I'm still trying to undue the damage that the Mormon church has done. I believe this book is the fictional work of Joseph Smith, who was a narcist and conjured up his religion to satisfy his sexual urges. No, I don't believe and I don't want to know any more. I'm done."
1,this book is true,"for one, about the smithsonian report, they have recently retracted that document, because of the fact that they have found out those things were acurate that they stated were wrong, and the first people on the americas didn't get there in 600 bc, they were there far before that...look at the book of ether, and lastly if a prophet recieves revelation from God, and another prophet of God gets the same one...word for word...how is that plagarism? this book is true and i love it"
1,Book of Mormon - The Koran,I compare this book to the Koran. I tried to read the BoM through but I found it so uninspiring and flat that I could not endure to continue. I experienced the same thing with the Koran. I tried to read islams holy book and I found it as dead and sterile as the BofM. I have heard so much about both of these books that I thought I would at least try and read them to find out what all the excitement was about. If you can sit down and read the Book of Mormon from start to finish..then you have a more diciplined mind than me.
2,True and irrefutable,There is no way on earth Joseph Smith could have concocted and written this book. Any truly rational being who investigates it with the intent of discovering its beauty will be richly rewarded. Try to be open-minded and prayerful and the result is guaranteed.
1,Comedy genius,"This book lists Joseph Smith as the 'Translator"". Now that is rich, hold on while I clear my nose of the milk bubbles. Joseph Smith was no more God's prophet than Muhhamed was. In fact, the similarities between Mormonism and Islam are so profound as to exemplity the fact that the Devil actively seeks the promotion of heresies. 2 different knuckleheads claim angels came to them and came up with a new 'sacred book.' Both losers treated women as second class and promoted polygamy. Both birdbrains taught on going revelations which actively changed to fit the moment. Ask a Mormon where early Christianity went wrong and they blubber about a great apostosy which they cannot define. Boys and girls of the LDS church, you are being decieved!"
1,Snoozefest,"Whether or not one believes this book's outlandish claims, this book is BORING!!! ""And it came to pass this ... , And it came to pass that..."" Truly mind-numbing and uninspired text. For a book that has been around for over 150 years, you would think it would have inspired far more people to join the Mormon church than its paltry 12 million people worldwide membership everyone here is boasting. 12 million is nothing and at least half of that number consists of people totally inactive and have nothing to do with the Church. For a book that claims to contain all the truths of the Mormon gospel, it leaves out many aspects of Mormon culture and doctrine that is universally taught today - eternal families probably the biggest example. Don't waste your money. If you REALLY want this book, get the missionaries to give it to you for free."
1,"A pretentious, ill-conceived, mess","The book is a long-winded attempt to create an ancient american indian epic religious fantasy, using cliches from the King James version of the Bible."
1,Why the elizabethan english?,"I don't get the Elizabethan English style in which the book is written....if the book was ""translated"" in the 1800's from ""Reformed Egyptian"" then why in the world is the book written in language common to the 1500-1600's rather than language common to the 1800's? It just doesn't make sense.....unless it is intended to mimic the style of the King James version of the Bible. Oh wait, I think I get it now."
1,"Oops, now what?","The Book of Mormon contains a promise to all who read it. The Lord has given each of a promise through the last prophet in the book that if we will read from it, ponder it, and pray about it -then God will let us know that it is true.I have done so. Read it thrice. Thought long and hard on it's text and it's holy edification. And finally prayed long and hard every day asking for the divinity of it's truth to cleanse and wash over me so that I might follow with all my heart to know it's truth.But it hasn't happened. It all feels so false. Completely without substance or verasity. Should the recipe end - Repeat? Signal from God is that it's still a farse."
3,Best book I've read since the Bible,"I love this book. We read it as a family this year. We read about a chapter a day. It brings a good feeling into our home when we read it together.If you Love the Savior, Jesus Christ, you will enjoy every page of this book. If you believe the Bible to be the word of God you will enjoy this book.Read it fast or read it slow you will be thankful that you took the time. If you have the agency to choose what you do then you should use it to give this great book a read."
1,This book is just a fake,"I tried to read the book of Mormon, here in Brazil. Before even to begin to read, I knew that it was a fake. Even so, I tried to read and I didn't finished it. This book is just a Bible's mockery.Some months ago, going to an internet site full of copies of books, printed in XIX century, I read some pages of the originals edictions of this fake and they are full of eugenists/racists views. These eugenicists views were changed in XX century, because of laws treatining to retire taxes' favors to the Mormon cult/church.You can read for free, the originals edictions of this book printed between 1850 and 1900. Being a fake and even more being, full of changes from the early edictions, maden not by ""God"", but beyond doubt, by Mormon cult itself, I have to give just one star for this very changed American fake."
1,Not something I would suggest to anyone,"Like Mark Twain said the book is chloroform in print. As a look into some of the beliefs of 19th century Americana it might be useful to scholars but for the general person it isn't.The book purports to be a true historical account of the some or all of the inhabitants of the American Continent. It mentions pre-Columbian horses, chariots, steel, barley and other items that were not existant in the Americas until after Columbus. It also indicates that the American Indians are descendants of the Israelites and so are of Semitic origin (a 19th century belief). However DNA evidence does not show this is true.The author, Joseph Smith, was a pedophilic con-man who was into folk-magic and esoteric occult practices. I'd pass on this book if I had the choice."
1,Why pay for something you can get for free?,"This book is free and readily available at any LDS chapel, any thriftstore, or by contacting the church headquarters.This is a book of fiction that resembles the early days in the Mormon church. It is made up of direct quotes from the Bible and endless numbers of wars.I was born and raised in the LDS church. I served a mission. I was an honorable member. I left the church because of the lies.Do yourself a favor and get a free copy of this book if you are interested in reading it. Do not spend a dime as it will only add to the spreading of lies, including the one about needing to pay money for this book."
1,The Catechism of the Catholic Church says it all,"(From Paragraph 67) Christian faith cannot accept 'revelations' that claim to surpass or correct the Revelation of which Christ is the fulfilment, as is the case in certain non-Christian religions and also in certain recent sects which base themselves on such 'revelations'.(Paragraph 73) God has revealed himself fully by sending his own Son, in whom he has established his covenant for ever. The Son is his Father's definitive Word; so there will be no further Revelation after him."
1,Which Book?,Which God are you going to serve? The God of the Bible or the God of the Book of Mormon? Read the Bible...then compare it to the Book of Mormon. Then tell me which book is inspired....I condem this book as it is from a man and not from God....Read the Words of Christ not the Words of the Demon Moroni....
1,Utterly Racist !!!!!!!!,"I read this book a couple of days ago..Behold, another 19th century eurocentric racist nonsense..No person of color should dupe themselves so much as to follow this religion that teaches one to self-hate himself because of his skin color..This is why I am an ATHEIST !!!!!!!!"
1,1800s fiction,This book is boring for one thing! It's also stolen from View of the Hebrews written in 1825 by Ethan Smith (no relation to big Joe and yes that's before Joe's visions of grandieur).It's a strange book with nothing to do with the actual Mormon church. Contradicts the bible a lot too.NO proof of any DNA evidence of hebrew people being in the Americas.
1,"Total ..., but sometimes inspiring and interesting","I have read the Book of Mormon several times. It is a sometimes inspiring and compelling book, but the fact that it is a total ..., and produced by Joseph Smith and not from the mysterious and elusive gold plates, totally undermines its value. Maybe someday, the Mormon church will finally figure out that its authenticity it unsupportable, and see it as a kind of fictional scripture. Till then, it is a total waste of time to read or consider this book, except as an historical curiosity. But if anyone is still interested and really wants one, it can be obtained for free from Mormon missionaries. But then dealing with them is a considerable price to pay.of course, dealing with them is a whole new matter."
1,Can not believe my eyes,"First, I want to say that I can't understand how intelligent people believe in the story within the pages of the book of mormon. I am from Mexico and I never heard anything about people coming from israel to south and central America. I read the book acouple of months ago and it is full of people killing each other , raping and canibalism. The great Nephi killed a drunk man to steal the drunk's property, because God told him to do it. Come on! WAKE UP!!! Use the logic! If you think that you have a brain, USE IT! I would sugest to every one that decides to read the book, to investigate after they read it. check online and also called the missionaries and ask them about your doubts and questions. Ask them about the CURSE of CAIN, ask them about the secret handshakes and tokens in the temple, ask them if they feel they better than you, invite them to your house and feed them with the truth and the real history of the church. Let's call them and start a deconvertion."
5,What an incredible book!,"If you want to be happy and have a sense of direction and meaning in your life and of who you really are, then read this book and follow the teachings found in its pages. There are many parallels between problems that exist in the world today, and the problems of the people who lived in the Americas when this book was written. You can learn a lot about human nature from studying their history and perhaps learn to be wiser than they. This is a history about the people who once lived in the ancient Americas and God's dealings with them. God has always been mindful of his children regardless of where they are scattered across the earth."
5,book of mormon is the true book,i got many things out of it and some people might not agree because they are not mormon like me
5,Book of Life,Plain and simple!!!!! This is the most important book that you could ever read in your life.
3,LDS leaders claim that this work of fiction is true history.,"This is a soporific work of fiction. It purports that the Book's immigrants to the Americas are the ""principal ancstors of the American Indians."" This is a complete fiction; American Indians are the descendants of immigrants from Northern Asia.LDS Church leaders know this truth, nevertheless they insist on making untruthful claims propagted in many channels, including a field force of tens of thousands of missionaries."
1,Poorly Written and Unconvincing,"I'm not sure what could keep a person interested in this book long enough to finish it besides religious fervor or morbid curiosity. It is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. As history, it is utterly unconvincing. As literature, it is hopelessly flat, repetitious, and contrived. As a book of religious scripture, it is unoriginal -- it actually lifts a significant number of its verses and chapters directly from the King James version of the Bible!It is incredible to me that anyone could find this book in any way inspiring. As for me, I tend to agree with Mark Twain's own review of the Book of Mormon. It is ""chloroform in print."""
1,popular american mythology,"the book is a very nice book of mytholgy but I must admit it is one of the most boring ones I have ever read(at least Zeus didn't claim to have guns!). Looking at it through a rleigious point of view it was tolerable if you are dedicated to this sort of thing,but looking at it as a historical record is almost laughable so many things have been physically disproven. Of course this very odd akward dull peice of work does get you to help understand your oddly mormon neighbors."
1,Disappointing,"I was disapponted in this book. It was difficult to follow, repetitive, and had no real message of hope or love. I believe this book promotes racism.I thought the idea of people being cursed with dark skin was racist. Furthermore, the pictures of Christ showed a white man with long flowing hair and a beard, which are both prohibited by LDS educational institutes in their ""honor code."" This was the first of many contradictions.I cannot see any ethnic minorities that would be interested in this book or the publishers.There were similarities to the Holy Bible that seem to be taken directly across, chapter and verse.Overall, a very disappointing read.I would not recommend it."
5,A Life-Changing Book,"It's sad that most of the negative reviewers will not even have read this book. There is an organized vendetta against it, probably because it is such a force for good. Test it for yourself, with an open mind. If you believe or want to believe there is a God, then the Book of Mormon is a doorway to peace and more faith. You don't have to be a member of the LDS Church to feel that there is core truth here."
1,Great Practice,"If you've never bought anything on amazon.com before, buying this book is a great place to practice your first purchase. You probably won't find any cheaper items on this site. But if you want to keep your ""almost full"" garbage can from overflowing, have the book sent to someone or somewhere else...it's not good reading material at all..."
4,Solid Quailty,I bought this book for a halloween costume so I can't really comment on the content but the books quality is very nice. A nice hardback and the pages seemed to be good quality.The only reason I didn't rate it 5 is that it costs too much for a book that I should have just grabbed from a Marriott hotel room for free.
5,Peace of Mind,"The Book of Mormon has changed my life. Whenever I read it, it fills my heart and mind with peace. It provides answers to many of life's questions and has brought me closer to Christ. I know that any one who reads this book with an open heart will also become closer to Christ.With all the questions and arguments out there, I hope that you will find out for yourself. Read the book and take your questions straight to the source. Pray and ask God if the Book of Mormon is his communication with prophets of old. I know this is true and I challenge you to do the same.Again, this book has changed my life and I will study it for the rest of my life."
2,Wait for the movie ...,"I was going to read the Book of Mormon but thought, ""Hey! Why not wait until the movie comes out?"" After long last, the movie came out about a year ago but it was not a very good movie. Most of the actors wore table cloths for costumes and had SuperCuts hair-do's.In all fairness, the movie only depicted a first segment of the Book of Mormon. Maybe as the further chapters are filmed, it might get better. Kinda like a REVERSE of the Star Wars syndrome where the more movies they made, the progressively worse they got and maybe the Book of Mormon gets really interesting later on.I am giving the Book of Mormon 2 stars, not because of the book, but because the star of the BoM movie, Noah Danby, is pretty hot and has done gay nude scenes on Showtime's ""Queer as Folks."""
5,a great book & story of facts & history of an earlier people,"A great book received through revelation from God our Father in Heaven. A history of an earlier civilazation on this the american continent. Basic enlightment of truth vs. evil, humilty vs. pride. How we should live our lives and have peace of mine through our savior Jesus Christ the Son of God the Father. The book of mormon is another testament of the truthfulness of Jesus Christ being our savior for all of mankind. This is a good book based on information from revelation, not falsehoods and misconceptions of man as acted upon through wrong promptings of the adversary. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading this book!!!!"
4,I Don't Understand,"Why it is people have to attack and revolt with nothing to back it up but ingnorance? I am an inactive Latter Day Saint but would never say anything offensive of any kind regardless of whether or not I agree/believe with this book and teachings. The LDS religion is nothing short of KIND HEARTED PEOPLE willing to help anyone and eveyone at the drop of a hat. They've only helped people. They done NO HARM to anyone. Yet I find that people attack them whenever and for whatever reason. While there are those who may be mean 95% of ""Mormons"" are lovely people. Ignorance is no reason to distasteful. Please watch yourn responces as I believe anyone might get defensive with some of the comments within. Just like any book you have to read it for yourself and find out if it's for you. If not... move on."
5,You can know for yourself!,"Although I was born and raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I still needed to find out for myself if The Book of Mormon is true. When I was in my 20s I read it through from beginning to end for the first time. Then, as I was instructed at the end of the book in Moroni 10:4, I prayed and asked God and received a powerful confirmation through His spirit that this book is indeed His word. It is, as the subtitle says, ""Another Testament of Jesus Christ"" as the Lord and Savior of the earth. Since that time I have read and studied this wonderful book over and over again and it has provided priceless direction and inspiration in my life. You can have this same witness for yourself. If you read this book with an open heart and mind and ask God, I promise you that you will receive a witness of its truth."
3,I Read It Because I Try To Read The Texts Of Major Religions,"The concept behind this book is interesting, whatever else may be said of the religion for which it is sacred literature. Is it colorful fiction? Divine revelation? Was it penned (as my one-time neighbor solemnly cautioned me) by a deceptive fiend straight out of Hell? I have no idea. I found the Book of Mormon remarkably readable and light compared to most liturgical tomes and was impressed a time or two by its quality, if not by its claims. I suppose my ultimate feeling is that if The Book of Mormon makes someone a better person for believing in it, then I see it as no less valid as an item of faith than any other holy work."
5,Most correct book of any book on earth.,"The Book of Mormon is an inspired translation from ancient text that will bring you closer to Christ than any other book. Some day it will be obvious to everyone that this book contains the fullness of the gospel for us in these wicked times, and it won't be a matter of whether you believe it or not, but it will be a choice of whether you will follow your God or not. You are blessed to be able to have one within your reach."
1,Nothing Unique and nothing interesting for most people,"The Book of Mormon has too many questions attached to it... Ifyou are a Mormon you will love this book, 99% of the rest of you shallfind it incredibly dull. Considering that the book repeatedly says itconsists of abridgements of ancient texts it is incredible it usessuch longwinded language. For example in the New Testament there is averse about God taking his children under his wings like a hen withchicks- in the Book of Mormon this is stretched out into severalrepeating verses. The language is a problem too. It is claimed thatthis book was written in 'reformed Egyptian' (a language unknown toall but Mormons), but why didn't these Jews use a kind of monumentalHebrew, Aramaic or Syraic? The translation is into 'Ye Olde English',Joseph Smith would have been better putting it into his own tongue. Hemakes mistakes such as talking about 'cherubims'- -im is a basicHebrew plural so it's like saying angelses!..."
1,Not worth the effort,"As former LDS who resigned from that church, I have read the Book of Mormon several times. Someone who is a believing member would find it to be of value on a purely emotional level, but for the rest of us (what LDS call gentiles), the Book of Mormon has no value what so ever. I find it difficult to believe that I ever took it seriously. The book is just badly written fiction. You can get a copy here for $0.01 which is about what it's worth, but don't forget shipping and handling which makes the purchase of that rag a poor value.There are many fine books on Amazon.com that address Mormonism in a much more honest way. Look for books on the Mountain Meadows Massacre (Sept 11, 1857 -- our first 911), or books about Joseph Smith's polygamy or other nefarious acts."
1,A guide for the misled,"This book is just what my title says. Anyone who does a bit of research and is just a little bit critical will come to this conclusion: This book is made up. Fantasy. Never happened. Even if you consider this a fictional story,it is still illogical, self-righteous and irritanting (just like the Mormon Church itself) I think it's strange amazon publishes this kind of dangerous cultist-book. There ist no enlightement within this book, in fact if you start to believe the content (again fantasy; you could also believe Lord of the Rings is true, which probably would be less harmful to yourself) itwill throw you into a world of weird rules, fake ideology and denial. Do not read this book."
1,The Book of Mormon: Testamony of Jesus Smith,"There is no theological realities in this book. Got to hand it to Joe, though, he was clever!"
1,Trite trash for the gullible,"As the title states, if you believe the backstory provided in the forward you deserve what you get."
1,nonsense,"The feeling I had when I read this book was that a I was reading the largest collection of nonsense ever. It is a surrealistic story even more fantastic than The Lord of the Rings. It has an internal coherence however that may explain the attention it deserves even today. But it is nothing to be taken seriously by any intelligent person. John Smith was a religious version of a snake-oil salesman that decided to write a book. He was a creative guy, no doubt about it, because it is not easy to put all these words together. But from there to ""revelation"" there is a long way to go."
1,Fuel for the fire,This book would make great kindling for your next campfire if it weren't for the flame proof enamel.
1,"At worst, this is the most harmful book you could ever read.","At best, reading it will be the biggest waste of your time. It's boring, it's poorly written, it's fiction, and reading it could be the first step to ruining your life. What else can I say? Oh yes, that I would have liked to have given it zero stars or even negative stars, but that is not an option.I can't warn you away from this book enough. I wasted 10 years of my life in this dreadful church and have many regrets. Don't waste your time, money, or energy. They don't tell you everything at first, it's called ""milk before meat."" By the time you find out the truth, you're completely wrapped up in it. I cannot say this enough: beware!"
2,Interesting book but not without controversy,"The LDS church is a fascinating religion with an interesting history. I think the members of the religion are generally good people with good intentions. However, because the Mormons are so invested in their religion, they will only present their religion in the best possible light and avoid controversial issues-- which are many. If you are looking into the religion, be sure to investigate all facets of their beliefs including their views on race and plural marriage before deciding. I think it's only fair that someone be informed of the whole religion and it's history, and not avoiding beliefs that may turn someone off of the church.Some interesting passages in the Book of Mormon include: 2 Nephi 5: 21. 3 Nephi 2: 15"
1,Awful Read!,"This book was an sad attempt by Joseph Smith to create scripture. The term ""And it came to pass"" was beaten to death in this volume, making you wish the ending would ""come to pass."" You're find people who had trouble breathing after their heads were cut off, boats with holes at the top and bottom of them with only corks to keep the water out, and a Jesus that murders over 100,000 people in order to bring the American people his Gospel of ""Grace."" Skip this book and get a root canal done, it would be less painful. Don't let the members of the LDS Church fool you, 99% of them only read this book when they are forced to, as in Sunday School."
1,Save your money,"The less said about this grim tome the better. The whole idea of publishing with Doubleday is an attempt at mainstreaming the entire LDS corporation.Joseph Smith, the author of the book, was 170 years too early. He too tried to sell the copyright of the book."
5,What is written by the spirit,"Like the Bible, the Book of Mormon was written by many prophets and compiled into one book. These writtings were written by the spirit and can only be understood by the spirit. It is amusing to hear critics complain that Joseph Smith took verses of scripture right out of the Old Testament. The truth is, these prophets had access to the Old Testament by way of brass plates they brought with them across the ocean to the American continent. In their writtings they loved to quote scripture, especially Isaiah. Other critics offer similar complaints but it is clear they do not understand the Book of Mormon. What was written by the spirit must be understood by the spirit, so it is no wonder there is such a great division in peoples opinions about this true book."
1,Mormonism Hurts Families,"I was going to write a long-winded review of this work of fiction, but I see that the ground has already been largely covered. Instead, let me simply add my witness that Mormonism hurts families. The Mormon church is racist, money-hungry, power-hungry and absolutely corrupt.No worries though...the Internet has allowed the dirty truth about Mormonism to reach the masses. The implosion has already started and cannot be stopped. The LDS corporate bosses are powerless to stop it...God bless the Net!!"
1,"Verily, verily, thus sayeth me.","And it came to pass that this book doth stinketh, even doth it stinketh exceedingly. But some shall say this book doth not stink. Wherefore, be not fooled by those who say this book doth stinketh not, for they have want for much money from thee, yea, even money that ye waxed strong to earn. For this book doth have a sale price of $16.47, which price is exceedingly much for such a stinky book. Wherefore, if thou doth have want to read this most loathsome book, yea, goeth now to thy local mormon church, and they shall give unto thee a copy for free, yea even a copy with pictures."
5,Do you want to know Jesus Christ? Then read this book.,"I have read this book repeatedly. Yes, I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints and have had the opportunity to share the Book of Mormon many times. The Book of Mormon guides people to truth in a day when religion is more philosophy and interpretation than revelation from God.The Book of Mormon teaches that the only way to true peace and happiness is through Jesus Christ.If you are looking for proof about the Book of Mormon, it is there! For years archiologists have been finding piles and piles of evidence in south and central America that support the history of the Book of Mormon. One only need research for themselves if they are looking for historical witnesses. Scholars from BYU have been finding evidence for years and years.But the real proof comes from reading the book yourself and then praying about it SINCERELY AND UNBIASED! Then you will know the truth about the validity of the Book of Mormon."
1,good firewood,"To those of you who are easily offended, I would ask you to please look in the true word of God in Revelation chapter 22, verses 18, 19 which says this, and by the way, I'm coming from The Good News Bible, Todays English version:""I, John, solemnly warn anyone who hears the prophetic words of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to his punishment the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes away from this book, God will take away from him his share of the fruit of the tree of life and of the Holy City, which are described in this book.""Now if someone hates me for what I just said, that's ok. I love everyone because God commands me to. But I mean it when I say that I never read this book, and I never will!! It probably makes very good fire wood. And that is all it should be used for."
1,Couldn't be any more fictional,"DNA tests of Jews and American Indians has completely proved the Book of Mormon to be a rediculous work of fiction.Joseph Smith, when ""translating"" this book with seer stones in a hat and the hat over his face, completely ripped off the style of the Bible.Every piece of archaeology evidence out there also disproves this book.It's amazing that people are so easily brain-washed into religions that they can believe such a book."
1,The only reason...,That I gave this miserable execuse for a book one star is that it is impossible to give it less than that. If possible I would give it negative nine point five time ten to the minus 23rd Power. Thus negating the lies of this disgraceful religions slaves.
5,Don't miss reading this Book,"Gripping, inspiring, motivating, and spiritually uplifting are all the characteristics of this book. Right from the beginning you are taken on an incredible adventure with a man named Lehi and his family. Together they pass through astonishing events and overcome incredible obstacles and the best part is that the events are all historically accurate. This family was the first to settle the ancient Americas and their story is one that you will not be able to put down. I strongly recommend this book to all those who seek inspiration because this book will give you just that."
2,Don't Buy It!,"...The book is pure fiction invented by Joseph Smith to make a little money. It's really pretty boring to read, too. There are some parts that provide inspiration, but they're few and far between--or else they're just copies straight out of the Bible. If you're buying this book to learn about Mormonism, you're better off starting with a commentary or history of the Mormons. If you're buying this book because you're thinking of actually becoming a Mormon, please do a little more research before you jump into it."
5,Changed My Life,"Excellent book for those seeking the truth. Reinforces Bible teachings, and gives a new perspective on many spiritual issues. This book and its teachings changed my life for the better. It increased my faith in God and the atonement of his Son, Jesus Christ."
1,Where's the choice for zero stars?,"""The Book of Mormon : Another Testament of Jesus Christ (Official Edition) by Joseph Smith"" By Joseph Smith is correct. Not ancient prophets. Nothing is inspired about this book at all. It's a Bible wanna-be and a poor one at that. You don't have to read any so called ""Anti-Mormon"" material to find it out. Just pick up a book on history, real history. Or DNA. Or Archaeology. Or Anthropology. Or Botony. Or Chemistry, Metalurgy, or Zoology. If it's science, then it proves this book wrong. Because science is the study of the actual, real world. This book is pure fiction, set in a fiction place with fictional people doing fictional events. Don't be fooled by this books claims. Any research into them will tell you the real truth."
1,it has potential,"Well just to say this, the plot is lacking, the claims it attempts to make are dubious, and it's not very convincing. other than that it's still a bad read if you don't take it too seriously."
1,Boring.,"I've read this book about 2x. The end where Jesus comes in is good. And that's about it. The middle of the book is so slow I would rather poke my eye out with a pencil. I think that the reason why people have a good 'feeling' when they pray about this book is because of the many chapters taken from the bible, and the fact that it talks about Christ. This is a work of fiction from a con, Joseph Smith, promoted by a false religion that sugar coats (and fabricates) it's own history so people won't leave."
1,I was raised to love this book,"I read it... over and over as I was told to do. I was bored beyond belief no matter how earnest my attemps at really connecting with the book might have been. I very much wanted to be one of the ""special"" that received a testimony to it's truth so that I could join the elite gang in the hereafter. I was never hooked, though. If there is one thing I despise, it's repetition and this book is loaded with it. I had to satisfy myself with just having the book... maybe if I held it long enough I wouldn't be so awful for not having been captivated by it's contents."
2,Its not a history of the ancestors of the Americas,"Whether someone enjoys the Book of Mormon or finds it boring, the reality is that it is not what it claims to be.Its not an account of ancient America. There is nothing that supports the idea that there was ever Nephites, Lamanites, Jaredites, here on the american continents.Just remember when readint this book that it IS a work of fiction. Not of fact. Its NOT a history of an ancient people."
1,Correction to Mormon Thomas R. Spencer's review,"On November 16, Thomas R. Spencer of Chapel Hill, NC wrote a favorable review of the ""Book of Mormon."" One of the claims in his review is incorrect. He wrote: ""If your interest is (also) academic, I would recommend the most recent major scholarly work on the topic: ""By the Hand of Mormon: . . . by Terryl Givens. . . . THIS IS A NON-PARTISAN ACCOUNT BY A SCHOLAR WHO IS NOT MORMON."" (caps mine)Terry Givens IS a believing and practicing Mormon, and is not ""non-partisan.""If someone is truly looking for scholarly work on the ""Book of Mormon,"" I recommend you go to ""signaturebooks.com"" and peruse its titles. This publisher provides the best-referenced scholarship I have seen on the ""Book of Mormon."""
1,The Book of Mormon,"This is a fictious book written originally by Larry Spaulding but stolen by the printer and surfaced as the Book of Mormon. The printer happened to be a friend of Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith started one of the fastest growing Cults in America that uses the words of Christianity, but not it's meaning.For Mormons to believe that they will become ""gods"" is a prime example of a modern day polytheistic religion. Mormonism therefore breaks the First commandment of the Lord God that says in Exodus 20, verse 3 ""You shall have no other gods before me."""
1,Not even good fiction,"During my over fifty years as a member of the LDS church I read the Book of Mormon six times. I kept waiting for it to speak to me on some level, either emotional, intellectual, or spiritual. It never did. It is tedious reading, comprised mostly of lengthy quotations from the King James version of the Bible, supplemented by imaginative plagiarism from various 19th century sources. I have repeatedly asked members of the LDS church to tell me *exactly* what it was that spoke to them. I have yet to receive a satisfactory answer. There are at least two good books on the market, ""An Insider's View of Mormon Origins"" by Grant Palmer, and ""Losing a Lost Tribe"" by Simon Southerton which provide excellent summaries of the problems faced by those who believe the Book of Mormon is some sort of actual historical record. If a person is *really* interested in the subject of Mormonism, then they should read those books, as well as the Book of Mormon. Otherwise, save your money."
1,a good liar......,"God said ""heaven and earth will pass away, but my WORD will not pass away"" God didn't say wordS. i am a christian and refuse to believe that Jesus was A god and not GOD.I COME BEARING TRUTH, and the truth is hard, but Jesus is God, the alpha and the omega. AMEN."
2,"A great story, mingled with scripture.","The Book of Mormon purports to be an account of a group of people who left Jerusalem several hundred years before Christ and settled in the americas to eventually become the ""principal ancestors"" of the American Indians.The story is rather long winded and difficult to read, but has good morals and lessons for life mixed into the excessively flowery account.[...]"
1,Archaeological Proof?,"So what does the National Geographic Society have to say about the Book of Mormon?Dear Mr. Larson:Thank you for writing to the National Geographic Society.The Society has never used the Book of Mormon to locate archaeological sites, and we do not believe that any of the places named in the Book of Mormon can be placed geographically by the evidence of archaeology. So far as we know there is no archaeological evidence to verify the history of early peoples of the Western Hemisphere as presented in the Book of Mormon.I hope you will find this information useful.Yours truly,Pamela TucciResearch Correspondence(...)"
1,You really wanna know what I think of it?,"First, it did a wonderful job of putting me to sleep. It was that boring. Secondly, it's a horrible work of fiction. Thirdly, it's a bunch of lies. While the Jewish Bible is proven historically with physical, tangible proof (such as the Western wall, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and all the archaeological evidence in the State of Israel), there is absolutely no proof whatsoever that anything that the Book of Mormon says is true. There is no proof of horses, elephants, steel, anything that the Book says in it, yet people swear by it, preach by it, try to convert people by it.Listen to the truth: this stuff never happened. It's a bad work of fiction. Don't waste your time reading it."
1,"Not bad, but it should be listed under fiction","If you want to know the truth about how this book was written, look up the south park episode called ""truth about mormons"" (I think.) Basically, some fraud ""translated"" some gold plates (that no one else saw) using a hat and two seer stones.LDS claims to be family oriented yet doesn't allow parents, siblings or friends to attend weddings unless that person is ""worthy."" (see: full tithe payer) I have never seen so much hurt come out of a religious group ever.Please pass this one up. And visit the recovery from mormonism board. (you can google it.)Good luck, God bless."
5,Inspirational,This book contains history that has many lessons that are applicable to our lives here in this present day. It has been an inspiration to myself and my family. I highly recommend this book. It contains many life lessons that helps encourage us to make our lives better and to help those around us. No other book has been more influential in our life.
5,Another Testament of Jesus Christ,"This book identifies two primary principles: Jesus is the Christ and He loves all people. A book of scripture that emphasizes the benefits of Christ-like living: humility, service, patience, eternal doctrine. Begin your reading with James 1:5 from the New Testament.That said...The naysayers remind me of a quote my m-in-l often uses:Man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still...I hope they find peace from their anxieties; finding peace, however, can seldom be found in denigrating others. Their essays are more instructive as to their own personal torments than as an unbiased evaluation of this book."
2,You can buy anything in this world with money.,"The Lord of the Rings was loads better. While the Book of Mormon includes excellent bits about hacking people's arms off, being shot at with arrows while invincible, a guy getting burned alive and a drunk guy getting executed, it fails to metion Joseph Smith's divine right to have sex with teenagers and married women, which would've spiced it up a bit.I have to point out that I'm surprised it's for sale, as it has always been given away for free before, but I guess times are tough.-Beth"
1,Review on Ebook not content.,"I'm reviewing the ebook, not the content.The format of this book on the kindle is cumbersome. It starts with the table of contents and then as it presents the verses each verse is headed by the chapter and verse. This format is followed in each chapter. It's not at all pleasing to look at much less read.I was looking for the Book of Mormon in more of a book format. I have this version in print and it's closer to book format than the basic Book of Mormon. Unfortunately, you would never know that based on the Kindle format.For the price of $3, it was very disappointing.I also purchasedThe Book of Mormon: 1830 Original Edition (LDS) (Kindle Preferred Active Table of Content Edition)for $0.99 and this was exactly what I was looking for. It is presented in book format with no verse numbers and no chapter headings.Off the topic, if you are looking for the full Standard Works you can use this direct link [...] to get the download that will work for the kindle."
5,The Book of Mormon-I love it!,"The Book of Mormon contains the spiritual and historical records of ancient inhabitants of the American continent. Comparable to the Bible, it contains the writings of prophets who were striving to lead the people to follow God's commandments. The most exciting part contains the account of Christ's visit to America after His resurrection.I have read the Book of Mormon many times and learn each time I reread it. I have learned about how to find peace and joy in my life and how to be a better person. It has also helped me have greater faith in Jesus Christ and His teachings to all people.The most important part of the Book of Mormon is the challenge contained therein to read it, ponder, and sincerely ask God if it is a true book. The promise is given that one really can know that it is true by the Spirit of God, which brings peace and enlightens one's understanding."
5,Seek and Ye shall find....,"I love this book. It completes the truths of the gospel, and of our Savior, Jesus Christ returning and redeeming mankind. If you have a humble heart and open mind, and prayerfully read it, you cannot deny this book is true, and is a history of real people. It transcends all things and unfolds the purpose of human life. I know it is inspired by God. A literal journal of truth."
1,Astounding,It is astounding to me that anyone in this day and age would believe that the original Native Americans were really Jews who came across the Atlantic Ocean. How on earth can anyone believe that? Where is the historical evidence?
2,108 Reviews,"All I have to say is that for a book to be for sale on Amazon for barely a month and already it has 108 reviews has got mean something, and those are only the 108 that were appropriate enough to leave posted. Obviously there is a reason this book polarizes people so much. Whether you believe the book or not, I believe it is a book to be reckoned with. So, love it or hate it, I think everyone should check it out. If you don't want to spend the money, you can get it for free from any Mormon, but that also means you may be invited to listen to a message from the missionaries as well. So, be warned."
1,Bad Book in Bad Elizabethan English,"The Book of Mormon proclaims to be a collection of divinely inspired stories of two Jewish tribes that came to the Americas around 600 B.C.It is a long, drawn out, war story that when originally written, betrayed the origins of Joseph Smith's uneducated (but not necessarily unintelligent) mind. After 150 years of revisions, mostly grammatical and spelling, the book is still extremely difficult to read due to the horrific King James English used in it.The book amazingly enough also managed to answer a lot of questions people were asking about religion, Masonry, etc. in western New York state during the 1820's. But if the Mormon church wants to try to attract people to their corporation, I mean church, they should really consider updating the language in the Book of Mormon."
5,Just read it for youself!,I cannot even begin to express what this book means to me. It is truly in a class by itself. I would simply encourage you to read it for yourself.
5,A Powerful Book for the Honest in Heart,"As I have read this book I have found the message to be one of faith in Jesus Christ and his divine mission here on earth. Any book that effectively carries that message is worth reading, but this one is also interesting becuase of the history included inside. A good read for anyone who really is interested in Jesus Christ and his ministry here on earth."
1,Surprised this book is still legal.......,"Disney's ""Song of the South"" was banned in the mid '80s because of racial overtones. The same ban should be applied to the Book of Mormon.It has multiple references to white racial superiority-""O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter* than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God.""and even more references to dark skinned people's racial inferiority-""And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a acurse* upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.""To actually say the Book of Mormon is ""another testament of Jesus Christ"" mocks christianity and religion in general. This book is destructive and hateful."
2,Chloroform in Print,"Mark Twain once referred to the Book of Mormon as ""chloroform in print."" He also commented that if you took all the phrases, ""And it came to pass"" out of the book, one would be left with a pamphlet. The Book of Mormon has become an American standard in some sense over the past 175 years. To fully understand the book, however, it should be read with another book to give it context such as Grant Palmer's, Insider's View of Mormon Origins."
1,"Reviewing a Religion, a book, or both?","For the reviewer who questions ""reviewing a religion,"" and to all who wonder why The Book of Mormon is published and distributed by a non-LDS source, consider these questions:1. This book is a religious book employing the name ""Mormon."" You can't separate the book from the religion, particularly when the primary source (the ""original"" gold plates) has vanished into thin air. The burden of proof is on the members of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to provide evidence that the book is ""true."" To do this, one must look at the merits or faults of the religion.2. The LDS prophet has said that either the Book of Mormon is true or false; either Mormonism is true or the greatest fraud perpetuted on mankind. It is important to read this book, consider the positive *and* negative educated opinions of it, and decide for yourself."
1,Former Mormon Seminary Teacher of Book of Mormon,"As a former mormon of 36 years, I have read the Book of Mormon countless times and even taught it to high school students as a seminary teacher. I think I know the Book of Mormon as anyone.First, as a faithful and believing mormon, it is just accepted and believed that the book is inspired scripture and more reliable than the Bible. I spent most of my adult life with this belief.However, I eventually decided that I needed to know if the book would hold up to a serious scrutiny. What I found was very distrubing. It is not a book of scriture, but a tale weaved from the thoughts of others by an 18th century con man named Joseph Smith.It is okay to read, just look into its history from good sources before you really believe it as God's word."
5,Inspiring,"The Book of Mormon is an amazing book. It has helped me come to know God through its stories, and how to become more like him. I feel humbled when I read it, and the desire to be better is strengthed. I hope you all get a chance to read it and to ponder its wonderful message."
1,False,"I first read this book when I was 16 years old. I wish that I never came across this book or those who profess it to be a scripture. Unfortunately, I have not realized that the Book of Mormon was simply a work of fiction until after I married a mormon. Since my parents were not mormons, the Mormon Church did not allow my parents to be present at my wedding in one of the mormon temples.Beware, this book is not divine, and it will break your family apart if you follow its teachings and the corporation behind it."
5,The Book of Mormon,"The Book of Mormon is just what the title says: Another testament of Jesus Christ. To many times for whatever reasons, people will put down the content of this book as well as its author, Joseph Smith Jr. The only way you can find out what it truely says, is by reading it for yourself and then asking yourself how you feel as you read it. It is a beautiful book, with many answers as to who you are, why you are here and where you are going. Enjoy!"
5,A compelling,"This book is a testimony which bears witness to the divinity of Jesus Christ as the Savior and redeemer of the world. If you really study the book, you will be able to distinguish the difference in writing styles from author to author. Truly facinating! Also, for the reviewer who complained about the Book of Mormon ""lifting"" several verses from the Bible? Do you really think it is that much of a coinsidence? I mean, they both came from the same source. If a verse is repeated it just might be important. Please consider all the angles before you go about making blatant accusations. This sacred work has changed the lives of millions of people from every corner of the world and continues to testify of the truth to those who are willing to open their hearts and accept it. It is true."
1,False Belief System,"Amazing that in our times anyone can believe Joseph Smiths fabricated account of American History. DNA, linguistic and archeolgy does not support the old false beliefs of Joseph Smiths time that Hebrews actually traveled to America. Totally unsubstantiated and irresponsible to teach Native Americans who are actually of Asian descent."
1,A Racist Book by a Racist Church,"Right off the bat (1 Nephi 12:23) it refers to dark-skinned people as a ""dark, loathsome, and a filthy people, full of idleness and all manner of abominations.""Promises dark-skinned people that as they become ""righteous,"" their skin will become ""white and delightsome."""
1,Don't waste your money buying this book-firewood is cheaper,"If it weren't for the flame-retardant enamel which covers the pages of the Book of Mormon, this book would make great kindling for your next campfire. Having read it several times I've yet to derive anything of significance from it. Unless you're a white supremacist and enjoy reading completely biased accounts of fabricated history, you will see nothing of value in the Book of Mormon."
5,The answer to all life's problems,"Every great thing in my life has come as a result of reading this book. If you will take the time to read, study, and apply the principles taught in this book you will find eternal truths and your life will be enriched.."
5,"Those who want to know the truth, can.","The Book of Mormon is the word of God as is the Bible as far as it is translated correctly. Those who want to know the truth and are seeking for truth will find it in the Book of Mormon. Those who have a contentious spirit or who are not really seeking truth, but just want to stir up trouble, will not only NOT see the truth contained therein, but will post sarcastic, negative and false information about this book and the Mormons in general. I am a convert to the church. I finally found what I had been looking for-a church that had truth and wasn't afraid to speak it regardless of the opinions of man. I am so grateful to have found the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and the Book of Mormon which has helped me know more about my Savior, Jesus Christ, and who He wants me to become. You can know the truth of this book, too, if you really are seeking truth. May the Lord bless you with this knowledge as you read."
5,BIG COUNTRY'S BEST WORK YET!!!!!!!!!!,This is my favorite Big Country album to listen to at the moment. It is really a true pleasure to again & again. My favorite tracks the title track Driving to Damascus Dive in to me Trouble the waters Shattered cross and too many ghosts. A sure classic in years to come. Great job lads!!!!
3,Solid,"Now nearly twenty years removed from their only hit song, Big Country keep on plugging away, giving us a new album of solid, big guitar anthems every couple of years. Driving to Damascus follows the path laid down by the last two albums, with Stuart Adamson singing passionately while the band careens along behind him, showing no signs of slowing down as the years go by. This is too melodic and well played to be heavy metal, but too loud and crunchy for the current watered down radio formats, and thus it gets lost in the shuffle. That's too bad, because there is a lot of good stuff here. There are a few slower songs here and they are some of the best moments. ""See You"" is an excellent mid-tempo song of heartbreak. This is a solid album, but it could use a couple of real standout tracks to raise it to the level of past works."
5,Secrets of the Koran,"We ordered this DVD to supplement a book we were reading for a study group at church in recognition of the 10th Anniversery of 9/11. Members of the study group were interested in learning more about the Islam religion to help facilitate understanding, love, and peacefulness between various religious groups. We also attended an interfaith conference at our local Islam Center which explored how similar (mostly) the Christian, Islam and Jewish faiths are."
1,Worst,"It is the worst movie that I have ever seen about Islam. It has nothing to do with the ""Secrets"" of the Coran as the title, but a lot of political issues. I really do not recomend it to anybody."
1,"No Violence, no koran","This film whitewash the bloody history of Islam and avoid talking about its violent and exclusive ideology.There is one thing the producer should have conveyed to the viewer: no violence, no Koran."
2,"Too much credibility given to Muslim ""scholars"".","Muslim ""scholars'"" priority number one is to keep Islam so complicated a maze that it seems far more substantive and profound than it is.The ""relationship"" between the Bible and the Koran is that the Koran was largely clumsily plagiarized from the Bible.Allah is nothing but a big bully, and Muhammad, if he indeed existed at all, was no ""prophet"".I'm fully aware that even the painfully obvious about Islam is verboten to be voiced in America today by the pseudo-tolerant Left.This nation is unquestionably doomed if too many of us allow the Lost Left to make the rules for us.The Left is in bed with Islam because they have common enemies:Christianity and the United States. They're combining forces to remove the last 2 obstacles to their respective Utopias. If they're successful the fun will really begin when they each find their ""tolerance"" can no longer abide the other's heresy from their respective cult doctrine.True that."
2,A bit too shallow,The video is a poor attempt to explain the immerging and effect of the Holy Book of QuraanIt didn't touch base on major aspects of the book that is full of miracles amzing the religious same as scientists of what the context carriesI really recommend researchers to find something on the book that is done by a suphysticated Islamic univercities such as Zaytuna in London or Al-Azhar in Cairo.. and by the European catholic by birth currently Muslim researchers such as Karen Armstrong and the most brilliant Hamza Yusuf http://www.zaytuna.orgThis DVD is good if you can do with a one page brief for an encyclopedia!
1,flimsy hinges,The hinges on Wednesday were broken upon receipt. All the hinges are flimsy plastic tabs that don't look like they would last very long. I'm in the process of returning it.
5,Great,Great products for my grandparents who aren't as good at remembering their medication as they used to be. Another great thing is deep pockets incase you have alot of pills or just might need more room if a sickness comes around to add medication to your daily pills
5,I love it,Years ago I found the small organizer at a store you could find things when it could not be found elsewhere. Over the years it needed to be replaced. I was so proud I found the 1in. online at Amazon.
5,Perfect,This was perfect for my mom. She has to take pills almost all day. This helps my mom and me to know if she is taking her pills like she should. Size of the compartments are great and holds lots of pills. Thanks
3,Does the job,"It serves its purpose, however, it is a cheap product. Edges of plastic tabs are easily chipped off. The tabs are hard to open if you don't have strong finger strength. Good way to keep pills organized."
5,no pill spillage,I've been taking tons of vitamins for years. This is the best pill holder I've ever had. Enough room for my fish oil and all the other stuff I put into it. Great product!!!
4,lifesaver!,This pill organizer is just what I need now that I'm wrestling with a number of prescriptions every day. I can set up an entire week's pills but then only carry one small box for the day. The compartments are ample for quite a few pills; there's a smaller version for those who don't need as much space.
4,for lots of pills,"i really lke this for lots of pills.. if you are only taking 2 or 3 per day.. there are many cheaper and with less tall walls which make it easier to get a pill out.. but for someone taking 5 to 10 pills a day, this is great..lots of space even when the day is divided for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime.. built very sturdy.. the clasps stay closed unlike the cheaper models. each day is colorful and the plastic only fits in base properly..if i were taking a few day holders on a trip, i would enclose in a clear baggie or clipped storage bag so not to lose one of the days when out on a table or going through baggage claim"
5,"""Just what the Doctor ordered"" !!","I suddenly had more meds to take on a daily basis, Morning, Noon & Night. I was using a large flat pill container so that I could seperate my meds for the day, but it was bulky and there was no place it fit neatly to keep my meds where I wouldn't forget to take something.I found this and I am so happy I did!! Each day is seperated into four compartments. The days all fit nicely into their little tray which is compact enough to fit in my cabinet. Each day I set that's days meds in easy reach. The compartments are roomy, but the way this is made everything is very compact.I would certainly recommend this to anyone who has numerious meds on a daily schedule. It works for me and I love it."
5,Grab a day and throw in your bag or briefcase,"It's stamped ""Made in the USA""Deep compartments, holds large pills well, this great for my diet supplements or anyone who has to take pills throughout a busy day."
5,Great organizer,Bought two of the organizer's for a 10 day international vacation and was quite impressed with how deep the individual four compartments are for each day of the week. In fact I was able to get 9 large & small capsules and tablets into each box for my morning supplements dosage. In addition the box lids stay shut and require a bit of effort to open but well worth it!
5,Functional and Fun Pill Organizer,"This pill organizer is very helpful. The compartments are deep and can hold many pills. Each box has a morning, noon, evening, and bedtime compartment. The compartments are easy to open and close, but remain shut even when being thrown around inside a purse all day.Besides being very functional, I love that each day is a different color. It's fun, keeps me on top of my daily medications, and makes taking these medications a more pleasant experience."
4,"High Capacity, Easy Open, Firm Close","Each one of the 4 daily compartments holds 10 large multivitamin pills without difficulty. The covers snap firmly closed, and open easily with a short fingernail. The hinges may be a weak spot; we'll see.Initially, a two-compartment-per-day organizer was shipped in error. The appearance is identical when wrapped. I am dissatisfied that Amazon provided no means to designate the return as their error and simply exchange the correct product for the wrong one. Amazon paid for the return, but left me to re-order and pay for shipping of the correct item on my own. I hope Amazon is not becoming ""iffy."""
4,Pill organizer,I purchased this organizer previously and decided to get another so I could fill two weeks at a time with my medications. I like the fact that the days are in individual containers so if you leave for several hours you have a small container to carry. They compartments close tightly and are a little difficult to open at times but I would rather put the extra effort into opening the compartment than have my pills spilled in my purse. I would definetly order another when necessary.
5,Adorable,"I purchased this as a gift for my sister and niece and they both loved it. I simply had to find the right size photo with her face in the correct orientation, then I made a scan and reprinted it so I'd have the original intact. Cute as can bee!"
1,"Useless Customer Service, No Support","I bought this phone used and it had missing AC adapter. I was hoping to be able to obtain it somewhere as well as an user's manual. What a major disappointment - you'd expect that product from such a major manufacturer would have parts available everywhere, first class support, web site with all kinds of information - well... forget it! This telephone uses very unique power supply - 6VAC there is no way to find it anywhere. Manufacturer's web site is utterly useless. Customer service 800 numbers are backed up, representatives based i India or who knows where and offer very limited help if any, most likely they will send you to a Sears or RadioShack store. Yes this is a discontinued model but not that old and this lack of support raises concern for the current line of products from Thompson, GE and RCA - once they become discontinued are they to be junked? I know one thing - I won't take chances and stay clear of this manufacturer's line of products."
5,GREAT PHONE FOR A GREAT PRICE,ONE OF THE BEST PHONES FOR THE MONEY.DOES EVERY THING I NEEDED IT TO DO AND MORE.STILL HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT ALL THAT IT CAN DO.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. THANKS FOR HAVING THIS PHONE.
3,Great review...,"If you don't know how to write, this book won't teach you; however, it is an excellent review, a good pattern, a genre-description. If you're a writer and you're WONDERING if you can write mysteries, this would be a good book for you to read."
4,Mystery Novel review,"A great basic how to book. If you're not familiar with mystery writing, or writing for that matter, and need a starting point. This a great starter."
3,Used in advanced high school class,"This is an excellent novel. Easily understood by students of 4th year or later. However, this edition falls apart easily. The pages fall out during the first reading. I use bullclips to hold the book together."
4,Maravillosa historia,Cautivante fuera de este mundo vaya aventura cosasde la vidad. Irealistica y conmovedora. Hecha a volar la imaginacion con las peleas contra los tiburones
3,"Not bad, but there's much better out there.","I bought these headphones based on the Jensen brand name reputation as well as price.Sound quality I found to be better than average.The overall fit and design is comfortable to wear.Unfortunately, mine broke in less than a year's time due to the poor quality plastic/design of the attachment pin area of the ear/speaker to the head piece.I could duct tape it back together but I think it's time to shop for something else.I think these headphones were priced a little too high for the quality."
3,Could be better,"This clock radio has practically all the bells and whistles you can ask for. The only shortcomings that I found was that the telephone was the old fashion 900 MHG analog instead of the 2.4 digital GHZ. This can be a small minus as the phone has 40 different channels to tune to in case of interference. The other disadvantages is that the large clock numerals gives off so much light (even in low display mode) that you can use it for a night light. If you sleep with your head at the same height as the clock radio you will have the light in your eyes each time you turn in that direction. A solution for this problem would be putting a piece of dark colored cellophane over the lighted numbers. Also, the phone does not have a lighted keypad for night viewing and clock radio doesn't have the dual alarm feature."
4,Small and Convenient,"Finally, a phone with a reasonably good radio that doesn't spill over the edge of my night table. The setup for the radio is excellent, each control easy to find even when the lights are out. Only one problem--the compartment for the 9 volt battery designed to save your setup even if there is a power interruption, caused a burning type smell for a half hour after setup. So far, no further difficulty.I think most people will be happy with this appliance. I discarded two previous similar purchases of phone/radio combos after using this one for the last month."
3,"Great Idea, But it needs some more work","When I got new furniture I decided that the phone, alarm clock, and caller ID unit should all be in one, (Yes, I was the one person under 60 that had a stand alone caller ID unit) and that the mess of wires was totally unnecessary. Most other units I found had LCD displays for the alarm clock, this one has a nice normal alarm clock display, but the controls are tough. Specifically, turning the alarm off, there are little slide buttons that are hard to use if you have the unit in front of you on a table in a well lit room, never mind trying to reach out of bed and turn it off. The handset takes some getting used to. It has buttons on the back, so you can't hold it on your shoulder. From an electronic perspective its great. The ergonomics need to be flushed out a little more."
3,Dear Still Waiting,"Here is is April 25th and we are still !!!!!!!!!!!!! waiting for this product which is ""on order"". This phone is just what I want and I will be extremely disappointed if (1) GE has discontinued this model and (2) they didn't bother to tell Amazon.I usually get such good service from Amazon but this is a puzzler."
4,WAKE UP!,I purchased and used this item for quiet awhile until I the cordless phones battery died on me. I looked on the internet and couldn't find a replacement battery for it. Finally scraped it and bought a Coby (see my review).
3,Not what I had hoped,"I bought this phone for my bedroom since it had the alarm clock function and the cordless function. The whole phone actually slants ""backward"" while sitting so sitting it on your headboard or anywhere above you makes it extremely difficult to see or turn off the alarm. A side table is really the best option. Also I am not thrilled with the functions for the phone being on both sides of the phone, I find myself flipping it back and forth looking for what I need. The phone does work fine, but takes some getting used to."
3,Did not connect with this one!,"I'm a big fan of Ms. Files and have read and enjoyed all of her previous novels. However, in ""Tastes Like Chicken"", I couldn't connect with the characters. The storyline was somewhat silly."
3,Seemed like Ms. Files was in a hurry,"I love black authors but sometimes we get a littel ahead of ourselves. I've just finished this book and I was very disappointed to say the least. It felt like this was a rushed book. Alot of loose ends were not tied up (possibly b/c there will be another book?). The book was a little unrealistic for my tastes. I know alot of black people and most of them do not have money just laid up somewhere. It seemed like Ms Files wanted to make a fairy tale, romantic, fairy tale but was in a hurry to make the release date. I'm awfully glad that I did not pay full price for this book. Definately a good read for all you insomniacs or 3rd shift workers but not a neccessity to your library."
3,The ending was horrible,"Lolita Files is by far my favorite author yet, the ending was just ridiculous. I was highly disappointed. I wanted to see the showdown between Tyrone and Tyrene. I felt like Files should have given the book some type of closure. I know there will be another book about it but man, you just can't leave your readers hanging for another 2 years on that subject."
2,Misty and Reesy are BACK and BETTER than ever...,"...if you enjoyed Misty's and Reesy's antics in ""Scenes from a Sistah"" and ""Gettin' to the Good Part"" you'll love ""Tastes Like Chicken"".The story picks up with Reesy preparing to get married. Only a ""surprise"" guest shows up at the wedding and the nuptials are halted. This is where the drama begins...the story revolves around Reesy who embarks on a trip across county to get away from the madness, Misty and Reesy's parents.I loved the book...my only complaint is to Ms. Files. Don't leave us waiting several years for a sequel. We tend to forget the essential pieces to the story."
5,Ready for the next one,"I enjoyed Taste like Chicken. I have read all of Ms Files books.Some reviewers complained about being left hanging. I say come on with it. I am ready for the next saga of Reesy, Misty, Tyrone, and Tyrene. I even want to know more about the dogs. Yes there is always room for improvement, but that is with everything in life. Keep on writing and learning. Because I am going to keep on buying.Ms Red Pittsburgh, Pa"
3,"Good, but it left me hanging","I like Lolita's books, but this one left me hanging at the end. There were some unresolved issues. I hope that there's a fourth installation coming out to see how the issues turned out."
3,"Can I get a drum stick, at least???","Taste Like Chicken was a cluck, cluck! I didn't make the connection with chicken...The storyline was weighed down with small/big words that were not context defining! Darn words had me running back and forth to the Webster, basically a time consuming read. The beginning and end of the book were great, but that silly California crap really devalued the authors delivery of what would have been an otherwise smash had it not been for the twins, dogs, and just silly immature nonsense - perhaps Lolita was compensating for writer's block. Why would what's her name suddenly reuinte and forgive a fiance without really discussing the issues and at least starting over...The ending was blah. Lolita should have played up the mother and father drama a bit more..."
3,Chicken Lite,"I am a fan of the Misty Fine/Reesy Snowden books. Scenes From A Sistah was good. Getting To The Good Part was even better (I much prefer Reesy's character to Misty's). But Tastes Like Chicken was...eh. While I enjoyed reading about Reesy's impending marriage and Rick and Misty's post-honeymoon life, this book could have been so much more. There were so many plot twists, I had to step back and regroup (and how could Reesy NOT tell the difference between a puppy and a kitten? What was that all about?). As for the Misty/Rick twist...I'm still trying to adjust, it was that creepy. Sleazy was the best character in the book, sort of an urban Yoda. The interactions between Reesy and her feisty grandmother were always entertaining. There were a few unresolved storylines that were rather obvious in leaving the door wide open for a fourth Misty/Reesy book. Die-hard fans will purchase the book regardless. I'm glad that I checked this one out of the public library."
1,Are we reviewing the same book?,"I am intending to start my own little business but have no idea how to, and bought this book. to my dissappointment, this book is so general and not touching the point. it tells me how great it is to start your own business...etc which i knew already, and left me unchanged about how to start my business and wondering where the hell the secrets are?!!If I want to know how to build a house, I don't need to know how great it is having my own house.. instead, I need to know that first i need to find the perfect land and other important steps. The book can save much paper in cutting off all the repetition of unnecessary sentences."
2,Live in 4 different german cities,"Thats what this should be called, for thats what it is. %80 of the songs on this album can be found on the ""On Stage"" album,which, mind you, is all from the SAME show. it gets two stars for ""star gazer"" and thats it becuase ""do you close your eyes"" is just a average song and all of the rest sound exacty like they do on ""On Stage"". The main probablem with this is that its all taken from sevral different live shows and it sounds kind of stapled together unlike ""On Stage"" which is a smooth atmosheric, consistant live experience. How many people do you know that have been to a concert? most likely they will tell you about what songs were done that night and what experiences thay had ON THAT NIGHT, not sevral nights scattered across the country. just get ON STAGE, it blows this boot leg quality recording to hell."
2,live album blows!!,"i'm sorry but this really is sad,a 60's jam ethic here puts me to sleep.ritchie sounds great as always,so that alone deserves it two star rating from me.cozy's drumming has always been overrated,too clumsy styled,he's considered a great,but it falls on my deaf ears why he is,he's got only a tenth of the talent that bonham,ward or paice possesed.pass!"
5,Great!,"This is a great live recording of Rainbow, 1976, with all the major ingredients of a wonderful hardrock performance. I still prefer On Stage, but this is a nice addition, with some other songs (Do you close your eyes, with smashing guitar!), and proof that in the 70s you could improvise if only you knew how to play. And these guys knew/know how to play!!!"
5,Blackmore & Dio were a great team...,"even though there were only 3 studio albums recorder with that line up. The recordings and songs hold up well over time and this Live from 1976 is a great collection. It is interesting to hear Blackmore's guitar playing, the way he changes and improvises parts differently in live situations. Dio is one of the best hard rock singers ever, even though his stage demeanor between songs is very odd. Recommended."
3,A very brief primer,"This book goes over the most basic information regarding how to brew beer. It doesn't go into much detail as to why things happen. Its almost more like a technical manual.I prefer ""The Joy of Homebrewing""."
3,Not As Good As Original Zingo...Even For Marvel Fans,"Our boys, ages 5 and 6, loved the original Zingo, so I saw this one and grabbed it because they love Spider-Man, too. However, the pictures on the tablets are really difficult to see. The manufacturer should have chosen a different color for the tiles or used better artwork than the simple line drawings. This version of Zingo sits on our shelf while the original Zingo is still played pretty frequently."
3,Nok Hockey Rview,I was disappointed with the quality of the of the game..I had an original in the 60s and the construction was so much better. I also don't understand why you don't include a few pucks as they wear very quickly. The game is still a lot of fun to play but it doesn't appear to be made very well and I question how long it will last. The original also had on each player's end the ability to keep score by moving beads ahead until you got to 11.
3,nok hockey ain't what it used to be,"If I wasn't so afraid that putting pressure on the board would crack it, it would be more fun - very expensive for quality - I should have listened to reviews - not worth it - make your own."
2,Good songs ruined by poor production!,"This album is pretty good! Songwriting is solid and the overall performance is very good. The problem is that this album features such a poor sound quality that ruins the album completely. Also, the drum machine that is used on the album is very boring and dated. Otherwise a good album, but I recommend new SG fans to start with ""Carved in Stone"" or ""Tyranny""."
4,Eh,Impressive debut from Shadow Gallery. If you like Dream Theater or any prog this album is well worth buying..
4,"Maybe not as good as the Pratt books, but very good","The author is a truly rounded man, a poet, an historian, a classical scholarand a scientist. He is also a humorist. This book is three novels in oneand has also the stories of Jorian that are short pseudo-historialtales about kings of the past in his home with morals.The action is rich in almost killing the hero and the love affairsare more true to life than romantic.You get the feeling that nothing in Jorian's life ever goes as planed.I really enjoyed this:I think the trilogy here is a classic of humor fantasy."
5,Celebration of life,"Passion, power, and awe-inspiring possibilities are but a few of the themes delivered effectively in this artist's latest work. The album flows from track to track as the listener journeys alongside the artist through the cautious first signs of life to the celebration of life in full bloom. The listener becomes self-aware, encouraged and empowered to achieve. For those who have never experienced New Age music, this may be just the tonic to spice up your musical awareness."
4,Just OK,This book is very similar to every other meteorology book. I was most disappointed in the lack of current photographs and weather information. Most of the information was older and stuff that I've seen in other books. I also wasn't expecting so much of the book to be dedicated to environmental concerns/climate change. It's just ok.
2,"Beautiful Pictures, Bad Geography...","This book is full of absolutely stunning photography.The author fails Geography 101. In the caption of a photo of a Southern California wildfire, he describes the location as Simi Valley, California, near Yosemite National Park. Well, yes, they're in the same, very large state, but near? Not by my definition - they're a 6-7 hour drive apart. An error that egregious makes me question the text credibility throughout."
5,Thank god it works,"I was thinking that my Sony Ericsson W300i wouldnt work with a 4GB M2 since Sony themselves said the maximum capacity for the W300i is 512MB. I got it today, opened it up, plugged it in my memory card slot on the phone, BAM, 3904MB of free space lol. Shows how much a phone's OWN company knows. So yeah, i recommends if you want allot of music and stuff."
4,SanDisk Review,"works well with my phone. i'm happy with the 4GB size as it makes it more convenient (and cheap) for me to just have my music and videos on one device instead of 2 (i.e. ipod + phone). the downfall, however, is the M2 adapter. it's not USB compatible and not sure what it's meant for, so i felt misled"
1,M2 Disk Review,I am unhappy with the seller of this product. I purchased two of the same disk and recieved one of them an SD Micro rather than the M2. The company has chose to ignore me and i can't seem to get what i want...
5,So far so Good,"It's a thankless job... you hardly ever get to hear from the happy people.Probably because it's suposed to work well, as it does."
3,Thanks for mentioning it already comes with a Pro Duo Adapter!!,Jerks! I bought an Adapter in addition to this card. Now I have two adapters! What do I need 2 adapters and one M2 stick for?
5,Memory card 4G,This device works great!! It has massive storage and it even came with a slide in adapter to put into your PC!! Worth every pennie!
4,Great Product!,"I just want to take the time to say that, I have been using this SanDisk SDMSM2-004G-A11M 4GB M2 Memory Stick Micro (Black) for about a month now. It works great and holds alot of memory. For those that, don't know it comes with it's own Adapter that, connects to your computer. Thank you, Amazon for this sites where you can find products at a reasonable price. Be Bless"
1,Not what I expected.,"This memory card fit my Sony Erickson Equinox phone fine, and it recognized it right away, but unless I'm a complete idiot, I can't for the life of me transfer music (MP3 files), to the card and have them be recognized by the phone. I've tried every way I can think of, copy and paste directly into the cards music folder, create a subfolder and paste into there, use the Media Go Software included with the phone, following their instructions to the letter, and still no transfers.The songs can be recognized on the card thru my computer, but the phone won't see them. I don't know it it's a limitation of the phone or the card, or there is another process that I don't know about that works, but the advertising for the card says easy transfer of all types of media files, Photos ,music, etc..), and it's just not promising that.If you know a better way, let me know here.Maybe they work better on MP3 players, but I wouldn't recommend getting one for this type of use."
4,Great Space,4GB was the sweet spot for me. Works great with my Sony Ericsson W580i cell phone. I waited until the 8GB came out to drive the 4GB price down.
4,Sony 4k Memory,This product had a good price and was received in good condition and worked fine. Delivery was a little slow and no information on shipping was received. Negative comments made me a little nervous and I probably won't order again.
2,"Good price, bad shipping","The price was great, but it took two weeks to get it, also shipped by USPS, orders online cannot be tracked, just showed ship date, but no tracking. I would NOT order from this company again!"
3,Walkman,I bought for my new phone Sony Ericsson Walkman. It works great! Lots of pictures and music in it!
3,4gigs isn't as big as it seems,"I've never had an mp3 player, so 4gb to store my music on sounded huge. I figured I could put my cd collection on there. But after the 10th cd, the space was half used up. I think getting the 4gb, or holding out for a bigger size- if there is one, would be a better bet. I just wish the 8gig wasn't so expensive. For that price, I can get an ipod."
5,works fine,"It works fine with my Z750a. After using this, I realized that I won't use 4 GB, maybe for pictures or music someday."
5,"Wow! Great Price, Lightning-Fast, no-error file transfers!","I bought this to use in mySony Ericsson W580i Jungle Green Phone (AT&T;), and I couldn't be happier. Wow. 4GB of storage, and I've used it for photos, video, and audio with great results.My main reason for purchasing the extra memory was to be able to carry around the review/refresher/practice CDs (rendered into .mp4s) I obtained withRosetta Stone V3: German, Level 1, 2 & 3, and this fits the bill perfectly.VERY happy with this product, and I saved more than half price -- compareSony 4 GB Memory Stick Micro! Go SANDISK!!!!!!!!!!!!!Five Stars PLUS!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE,"The battery life on this phone is criminal. If the cordless handset is left off of the base for more than 24 hours it loses its charge. I returned it to the store where it was purchased and exchanged it for the same model. Once again, this handset would not stay charged either, and this was after carefully following the directions on initially charging it for an extended period of time. The final straw was when I charged the handset for a full 48 hours, and yet the battery was low after less than 15 minutes of talk time."
1,Not worth it,"When this phone first came out, I was really excited- I wanted a corded, but needed a cordless along with the features it had.Within six months, the speaker blew. Now- I can only hear my messages if I retrieve them through the cordless and obviously I can't use the speakerphone; highly inconvenient. In addition,the cordless has really poor battery life.I'm now in the market for another phone and will not buy any GE or Southwestern bell."
4,I really like this phone,"I've owned this phone for almost two years now, and didn't have to replace the battery for well over a year of ownership. A couple of months ago I noticed the 'sticky' button isssue in the cordless handset that others have mentioned. In fact, none of my number buttons worked at all on the cordless unit. However, I liked features of the phone so much that I decided it was worth trying to fix. There were a couple of screws holding the handset together, and a couple more holding the PC board on inside--it was easy to get to the keypad and I discovered an oily substance between the back of the button pad and the pc board that relays the electrical signals. I cleaned the back of the button pad and the board off with Windex and let them dry thoroughly before reassembling. My handset works like new again, and it was really easy. Since the phone was nearly two years old when I had the first problem, I can't really complain. I've owned other phones I disliked right out of the box!"
2,Poor quality handset,"I agree with some of the other reviewers. The base unit is nice, but the cordless handset is very poor. We use it perhaps only two or three times a day. In the first year, we started having problems with the keypad, particularly the #2 button. Shortly thereafter it hardly worked at all and now some of the other buttons aren't working. Now it can only be used to answer calls. I also had to replace the battery in the first year."
3,Tentatively Pleased,"6/18/04Bought this phone last night. So far, I am pleased with it. I received a call on the corded base, and sound quality was really good.I used the cordless extension to call my elderly, hard-of-hearing grandmother and she told me that on her end I sounded crystal clear and loud enough for her to make out every word.My only current complaint is the faint clicking sound in the background as the cordless stays in touch with the base.I'll write another review in a few weeks or so if there are any new developments (ie, short battery life as other reviewers mentioned)."
1,Useless phone,I bought it last year and it stopped working after 3 months of use. The cordles does not come on and the base unit is just only good as a regular corded phone. I would strongly recommend against buying this phone. GE definitely have quality issues.
2,Don't buy this phone!,"I agree with a lot of the reviews before this. I bought this phone LESS THAN one year ago, and I've already had to change the battery twice for the cordless phone. About 7 months after I bought this phone, The 2 key went on the cordless phone, and now the 1 key is also gone. If I want to dial numbers with a one or two, I have to search to find that number on caller ID to dial it from my cordless phone! In addition, I searched to find replacement (and additional) cordless phones, and was unable to find any for this specific model. In summary, don't waste your money on this phone!"
3,"Cheap phone, maybe too cheap.","I've owned mine for nearly two years. I thought it was a great deal when I got it. I haven't seen the charge problem that others have mentioned. I don't think I have ever replaced the battery. I don't use the internal answering machine feature, so can't speak to that. What brought me to look up the phone is that starting a month ago the portable handset buttons started not working or ""sticking"" so when I press keys the number enters twice. I thought perhaps I had spilled something on it without realizing, but now I have seen two other reviewers have had the same problem. I use the handset a lot more than the corded base so if this keeps up, and there is no repair/replacement then I'll have to replace the phone. So, $80+ for a phone that lasted two years... Not so good in hind sight."
3,Good phone...,This phone and answer machine have been hanging on the wall in my house over 3 years. I have had no problem with either the portable phone or the answer machine. I did replace the battery because I wanted a longer stanby time. The portable phone can now be off the charger for over a week before the battery needs charging.The problem having the regular phone on the wall is the handset tends to drop if you are not overly careful hanging up. It has hit the floor a number of times and is a poor design. It does still work after being dropped.The portable phone has an annoying click sound when using it and the answer machine only records 14 minutes. I have a separate answer machine that has 40 minutes record time and is much better.It is my suggestion that buyers consider other phone systems only because so many people have had problems with this one. I have not had most of those problems. In my case the unit has been good.There are better choices. Why take a chance with this one.
3,All the features I needed,"I use the corded phone memories to store my business contacts & the walk-around, personal ones. As I read in other reviews, the speaker has a lot to be desired. The cordless also makes a buzzing noise when it is fully charged---but, all things considered (mainly the price of suitable alternatives), I would purchase another."
2,Not a great set of remixes.,"Goldfrapp is a spectacular accomplishment as a band and a personality, but this CD of remixes falls flat like so many remix CDs do. If you do get this, do so because there's a bunny on the cover, that's about it. There isn't even one track I would recommend. While the Spanish ""Calexico"" cover of Utopia, is unexpected, it's not terribly outstanding. And the Let's Get Physical cover of the UK Girls I can do without, though to Goldfrapp's credit they do a reasonable job of turning this into a ""Goldfrapp"" sounding track. Possibly the only track of genuine interest on this CD is the live version of Human, which sounds alarmingly close to the album version but with out the intense low end. And there's a Utopia dance remix and a blippity electronica remix--the usual fair. It's just that the proper album is already so fantastic these tracks don't explore that. But if you have a burning love of remixes, or you like to dance, you might like this CD."
4,Donburi - Full body Japanese Tattoo,"After reading 'Bangkok 8' by John Burdett, I was looking forward to read the next book in the series, 'Bangkok Tattoo'. Detective Sonchai Jitplecheep of The Royal Thai Police Force in District 8 is back with another case in his career. A farang(foreigner) is found dead in his mother's brothel Old Man's Club with his penis mutilated. Chanya, one of the girls of the club is a suspect. Colonel Vikorn, Sonchai's superior and co-owner of the club, orders him to carry out the investigation. The farang is a CIA operative in Bangkok recruited to report terrorst activities post-9/11 in Thailand. Sonchai starts his investigation and enters the world of terrorism and the japanese body art of Tattoo, which will help him to solve the case. Great read. Must read for the readers of 'Bangkok 8'. Sonchai gets better with time."
4,Visit the Street Life in Bangkok,"Having lived in Bangkok one year as an expat, I was very curious about John Burdett and his three books set in Bangkok. I got ahold of the second one first, Bangkok Tattoo. I have since ordered the other two. The humor makes you laugh outloud! It is right on. I loved his calling the reader farang, or foreigner. It is a word I heard often in Bangkok as the Thais commented to themselves about the many foreigners in their midst.Burdett has written an intriguing mystery. It contains, among other things, a humanized Thai whore; a mainly corrupt group of Thai cops and detectives; a CIA agent lost in his own mind; a philosophical Thai narrator and countless facts about the street life in Bangkok. The murders are horrendous and unique. The asides about Buddhism are wonderful. I can't wait to sink myself in to Bangkok 8, and I highly recommend this talented writer to mystery lovers everywhere.Cheryl Smith"
2,which swing of culture shock?,"a lot of others have commented that Bangkok 8 was a superior book. they're right.this book suffers badly from the author's imposition of his own voice over his character's. i find it hard to credit that a buddhist would take up such a vituperative stance toward westerners. lord knows western culture needs a good, solid critique right now, but somehow i don't believe it would come tripping out of a buddhist's mouth. buddhists after all are known for their tolerance of human--including western--foibles.so all i can assume is that the author is having one of those horrible culture shock swings, wherein his own culture looks really, really bad to him. maybe a vacation would help."
3,A Little Too Much Sex and Drug Use,"While I enjoy books about Southest Asia police work this one went a little over the top in its vivid descriptions of the sex life in Bangkok, and drug use. I often visit Thailand on business and have never seen the corruption the author tals about. Relative to drug use NONE of the Thai officers I know are users. The book gives a bleak desciption of Thai life and if believed could lead some not to travel there. The culmination with the mutilation style killing really ruined the mystery portions of the novel. I will buy no more John Burdett novels."
2,Repetitious Tripe,"""Tell me Farang"", how does it feel to know you threw ten bucks down the toilet. Burdett's first effort was a heroic surprise and garners a charitable 2 stars for this throwaway -- a cynical, cloyish, BORING effort to rake in the cash. A singular dearth of ideas, uncommonly purple prose, and a patronizing view of Thais and Farang alike. Look, if you need a vicarious make-believe Thai thrill whose extreme literary pretentiousness raises it just above a virtual Patpong hand-job, then, well, plunk down your chips and -- the real price tag -- your precious time. I'd awaited this follow-up eagerly. Now I think it would be a tender mercy if Burdett returned to lawyering and laid down his pen."
1,Insulting,"Every page insults with racism, romanticized prostitution and corruption. Burdett's first book, 'Bangkok 8', gave insight into the Thai culture through the character of devout Buddhist Sonchai. In this book, Papasan Sonchai has clearly left the Path."
4,worth reading,"If you have enjoyed reading the other books featuring Detective Jitleecheep in Bangkok; you will also take pleasure in this fun, interesting and complicated story. John Burdett is a great writer who has plenty of interesting insights into Thailand. I didn't expect the (different) ending. Treat yourself!"
3,A worthy follow-up to Bangkok 8,"As a sequal to Burdett's first novel set in Thailand , Bangkok Tattoo provides a good plot , more bizarre twists and turns then the first book did, and more characters who live in and around the seedy red light industries of Bangkok. As in the first book Americans, specifically CIA agents are used as foils to draw cultural distinctions and to provide some of the mystery and suspense that drives the action.Burdett writes well, with a healthy dose of humor added in to make his novels entertaining and relatively quick reads."
5,Awesome!,"Burdett knows Bangkok and Thai culture and expertly weaves it into this wonderful, sexy, underground, intellectural whodunnit. Pick it up and you won't put it down. and then when you are finished, you'll crave more!"
3,Too In Love With Its Premise,"I loved Bangkok 8, a clever, funny, but at the same time chilling procedural in the fascinating setting of modern Bangkok. Burdett's return to his characters in this sequel is still clever, intermittently funny, but the jokey, thumb-your-nose-at-the-West tone overwhelms the plot, which veers to the Baroque.Let's hope the second sequel will be a return to form."
3,Good entertainment.,"I enjoyed this book. I thought Bangkok 8 was better, but this was OK. I wouldn't pick up this book expecting it to be anything more than what it is."
1,Just skip it,"Ok like everyone else I loved Bangkok 8... but the characters we know and loved from the first book return here only to insult the reader. Which might have been forgivable had the rest of the book actually been well written which it was not. There was no action no intrigue or even a mystery. The narative is disjointed and in the middle of the book is a very long section of a Thai hooker's exploits in America, completely ignoring Sanchai for nearly 100 pages. So in the end this book was pretty pointless if only to call the reader a dumb Farang on every page."
2,Where's Sonchai?,"Like a lot of other reviewers, I read and loved Bangkok 8. What a great read. I was surprised to find- after I finished it, that it wasn't written by a Thai. Sonchai was a real person to me.Now I read Bangkok Tattoo and I wonder what happened to Sonchai? What comes through is a Brit slamming the U.S. and the west in general through the voice of Sonchai.What's the purpose of having the CIA being the fools in the story? The female boss of the CIA officers is a lesbian? Why's that? Why isn't MI6 the object of ridicule? Why is the word ""farang"" in every other sentence? I get it- I get it...it's a derogatory word for westerners, right?I hope Burdett keeps writing in the series. I also hopes he lets Sonchai act like a Thai Buddhist and not like some political commentator on the Chris Matthews show."
3,"A bit too strident, farang","A Western author, Burdett, adopts the persona of a Thai policeman, and peppers this whodunit with smug put downs of America and Western attitudes. One sniffs the self-loathing of the academic elite who somehow finds it enlightened to find fault with his own culture. The self-agrandizing subtext being that HE is immune from these trappings.As with the first novel, we find people killed by snakes (or eels), and a celebration of the freedom of the kah toey transexual life. It seems that Burdett had only one set of ideas, but took two novels to tell them in. If you've read the first, you've read the second. However, if you like the characters, you will enjoy them again here."
2,Bite Me Farong !!,"Don't waste your time, the author uses the word Farong about every other sentence. I think it is supposed to be funny. There is little here to capture the readers interest. Unless you like being called or referred to as a Farong, save your money. There is a somewhat interesting description of Bangkok and it's seamier side, in fact I think that is the only side of Bangkok you will read about in this book.There is supposed to be a mystery here somewhere, but I didn't think it was worth my time to keep looking for it. Finally after about half way through I gave up. I was luckily able to sell my copy on Amazon at a small loss."
3,Not Bangkok 8,"Me thinks John Burdett went off the deep end with karma, reincarnation, Buddhism, and the like to weave an unbelievable tale of detective fantasy. The only reality was the ending."
1,Disappointing,"Quite superficial. It seems that the perspective this book takes is based more on fears and suspicions than on real knowledge of the subject. There isn't enough responsible, reasonable thought in this book."
3,The Same Version at Two Prices?,"Beware that there are two prices for what appears to be the same CD, and both advertise the same track listings on Amazon. I paid $28.99, thinking I would get an expanded version, yet there is a $15.49 price for what appears to be the same CD. The $28.99 product is NOT a two CD set.I think the merchant needs to clarify what is exactly on both versions and not advertise the same version at two different prices. It's very confusing because the labels are identical. Hence the three stars. Other than that, my version has all my favorites except for ""Friggin in the Rigger,"" but not the extras some customers mentioned. Sound quality could be better; it's a little muffled, but much better than my old cassettes and the nostalgia is well worth it. A great tension releaser/tonic. Don't know if the the $15.49 version is any better, but I don't want to futz with an exchange."
4,Different Tracklisting! Not Complete!,"The tracklisting on amazon is incorrect. The cd does NOT include ""I Wanna Be Me"". Also, it doesn't have ""Bodies"" from Never Mind The Bollocks.If they had actually included ""I Wanna Be Me"" and ""Bodies"", this would get 5 stars easily..."
5,What more do you need?,"If you love music, and you already own everything by Iggy Pop and the Stooges, then buy this album, lock the door, and turn your amp up to eleven."
5,All You Need to Know,"The original version of the album featured a limited edition bonus disc - a July 1977 concert from Trondheim, Norway - and a poster, hence there may be confusion surrounding this standard release; it is the single disc issue, which features the songs from Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, along with other material that was mostly issued as B-sides.The interesting selections are B-sides Did You No Wrong, I Wanna Be Me, Satellite and No Fun; four very important songs, since they hint at the group's potential without the drama drummed up by Malcolm McLaren, which ultimately led to style over substance and the departure of John Lydon.Besides delving into demos, alternate takes and concert releases (bootlegs and official bootlegs), this CD gives a full picture of Lydon as lead vocalist, which is all one really needs to know about the band."
4,Good Shtuff,Very solid breaks. The tracks are really good and the mixing is ok. A really good CD to drop tracks from but not smooth straight through.
5,Gems from a Master,"This quasi-journal of Maugham's thoughts, travels, philosophies and bits of literature is facinating on several levels. For an avid Maugham fan, you can see the germination of the ideas and the travels that became his novels. The charming, brilliant and matter-of-fact way in which Maugham says startling things about life will have you underlining passages throughout the work."
2,not very pleased,"The clasp to fasten this item was flimsy to begin with, difficult to operate and finally broke after a week of wear."
2,Cute but....,This bow tie fell apart within 48 hrs after I received it. I was able to sew it back together but I don't think that I should've had to do that.
4,Costume Piece,"I bought this item for a show I was designing, but we did not wind up using it. Still, the item was shipped quickly and I am sure one day it will be used for something!"
2,poor quality bow tie,I got what I paid for with this bow tie: It broke and fell apart on the first night I wore it.
5,terrific ties,"excellent product! Needed spare bow ties for a mass choir for the boys who ""forgot"" these were terrific at a quarter of the cost of any others we found."
4,Solid Black Bowtie,"A solid black men's bowtie. It's not a real bowtie, in the sense that it is pre-tied so you just have to clip it in the back. Good condition and shipped promptly."
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for a real bow tie not a clip on. Aside from that, it looked ok until I tried putting it on and the stitching ripped. What a waste of money. I'm glad I didn't fork over much for it."
2,Broke after ONE DAY!,The clasp broke after just one night. The fabric is good quality but the latch in the back is made of super cheap plastice that will snap with any force.
1,It Broke!,This bowtie broke the first time my son wore it. Now I need to find another one before his next orchestra concert. :(
4,Great for costumes and for reals.,"Nice quality, great for the costume it was purchased for...could probably use for reals in a pinch. Kinda satiny. :)"
3,You get what you pay for,"Purchased this tie as a small gift for my brother; upon opening the packaging, the tie had a strong, smelly odor that transfers to your hands. Washing hands with soap doesn't even make it go away! Not sure where that came from, but I hope not all the ties have the stench. I also noticed that the band wasn't sewn correctly, so the tie is a little lopsided all the time. However, it's something that can be easily fixed if you know how to sew. But aside from that, for the price, it can't be beat. The bow is what's important and looks and feels just fine. You won't regret purchasing; just beware of the potential minor flaws."
4,Lookin' good,"Good accessory with some nice material. Solid buy.I won't give it a 5/5 though, because the threading that holds the left part of the clip on came out and I had to sew it back on (it's like 5 minutes, though, no big deal)Also keep in mind I got it for about $2 plus $1 shipping, so I'm reviewing it for THAT $3 price and no higher. At the current $6 would look elsewhere or expect more."
4,black tie,I ordered this tie for my son in law for Christmas. The price was incredible seeing what they are asking for the same tie in the malls. Quality looks great - I think he will like it. Delivery was prompt as promised....I would order from them again.
5,Great purchase,item was exactly what I wanted and the right price too! Very timely delivery. Thanks.
2,this tie only lasted six outings i will only give it a two star raring,"This tie only lasted six outings! It failed on the last outing, repair the tie standing in a line :( ! I will only give it a ;two Star rating :(unhappy John"
1,"Cheap plastic clip broke on first use, hard to use when resizing.","If you're used to the bowties with metal clasps, then you won't like this tie. When I readjusted the neck band, the plastic clips moved with it-- metal clasp ties ALWAYS have the hook at the bow and the loop side always moves forward to meet the hook.This tie was hard to put on, and I remember the clasp moving based on how I adjusted the neck band. One time it was by the bow, the next it was at the right side or back of my neck.The plastic clasp was the worst part-- I ordered this in with 2 day shipping, just in time to put it on for a concert-- and the clasp broke the very night I received the tie. The clasp is very flimsy."
3,Prozac Nation,"So much for the grass being greener on the other side. It turns out our neighbors, co-workers, and ex-sweethearts are just as depressed as we are, apparently. And they all like to sleep around, too. I'll meet you at the pharmacy...."
3,"Intruiging, but a bit disappointing","This finely crafted novel reveals a gifted writer at his craft. The characters are believable and complex. My feelings for them changed continuously. The many conversations about psychology, literature and jazz are engaging, and they flow in the story. Unfortunately I was dissatisfied with the ending. The final chapter is told through a new character, who lacks the insight to give a clear picture of the denouement. Still, I enjoyed this enough to try his other novels."
2,Interesting concept that failed to meet my expectations...could barely force myself to finish it.,"I agree with the review that stated that Perlman seemed to want to impress us with his vast knowledge rather than write a gripping or interesting story that moved along. I did think the ending made it worth the excruciating, plodding prose with the nice little wrap-up twist, which seemed almost mundane given how ""out there"" he tried to be with the rest of the structure of the novel. I read constantly, so I'd say it was worth the read to add to my knowledge of what I do and don't like; the concept seemed so promising, and maybe in another's hands, could have been so much more interesting. Hey, maybe that could be a good idea for a reality show---watch writers write the same story from seven different points of view! Er, maybe not. Maybe you just have to be from France to enjoy the book (see previous review)."
2,I just gave up,I read about 200 pages of this book before I just gave up. I read the review of this book in the New York Times' Sunday edition and thought I was in for a treat. I couldn't make it past the drab subject matter (corporate malfeasance in Australia) despite ocassional flashes of brilliance. I couldn't keep my interest during long stretches.
5,not a self-indulgence,"This book made me want to be kinder and more sensitive; not because I want to impress people, but because it will ease the suffering of those already in pain. I'm pleased that I was able to finish it; there is such a powerful reward at the end. Its a reward that has life-changing effects."
4,Intriguing Ideas,"The ideas presented in this novel are rather intriguing. The fact that the same basic story is told by seven different narrators who each reveal another aspect to the story is thought provoking and representative of real life. This book made me realize just how we each perceive things differently as determined by our own life experiences.The only problem I had with the book was Perlman's choice for the seventh and final narrator. The choice seemed a little odd to me and left the novel unfinished with too many details hanging in the air. It is possible that that was his intention though just so as to keep in line with the ""ambiguous"" theme."
3,the blind men and the elephant,"The difference in individuals' perception of the 'same' set of facts is a fascinating topic in literature. Most authors use only a couple of characters to show the skews in perception around the same 'elephant.' Lawrence Durrell is one of the most successful of these. Elliot Perlman is another. Perlman's novel suffers, not because he can't draw seven distinct characters, but because the flat, after the fact, featureless landscape in which they are set lacks drama. Most likely he did this with the idea of bringing their internal lives and the ideas they are discussing into sharper relief, but I would have preferred more local color and less literary and psychiatric theory."
2,"Dull, dull, dull","I've had two attempts at reading this, some 5 years apart. Couldn't get into it the first time and really pushed through the pain barrier on the second attempt. The author is somewhat impressed by his own erudition but does not give his readers anything satisfying - the language lacks colour and poetry, the characters are narcissistic and unlikeable and the dialogue is woefully wooden and unbelievable. Perhaps Perlman had a shopping list of pet obsessions that he just had to weave into one long turgid thesis and somehow managed to pass it off as fiction. I pushed on to the end, determined to find some redeeming qualities, but overall a thoroughly unenjoyable process."
5,Lost love,"This novel speaks to all of us who have loved and lost and wondered whether it is was better to have never loved at all. the story at times uncomfortable, heartbreaking and tragic reaffirms in the end the basic goodness of the human spirit. this is a book that makes us question our personal relationships and strive to love lest it be lost."
3,Seven Types of Ambiguity,this is a good read but found it at times repetitive Mr Perlman has a way with words so perhaps others will find it more profound
4,Powerful and Insightful,"This was a strong and insightful novel on numerous levels. The ending is not entirely satisfying but this is more than made up for by the character development and the author's commentary on the nature of success, ambition, love, attraction and fatherhood."
3,Not bad... just not that special...,"Personally, I don't like romances written in the first person perspective... It takes away from the novel because I'm not able to see the relationship from the point of view of both the hero and heroine. I can't track the connection between the lovers and I can't tell when the other person falls in love, or if it's just lust, you know what I mean?Umm... the relationship between Nick and Ariel is not as passionate as I would have liked. Mostly, it's just Nick being crazy, and Ariel trying to keep him sane.Um...Man, I wish I could say more...it's just... the book didn't leave much of an impression on me, y' know?I give this a 3 for being not too bad...but could have been better"
4,A Fun Read,"In his first book the author starts by taking you on a calm and scenic view of a home life that many of us can only dream about. As the book goes on, you find yourself not being able to stop reading. You have to get to the end to see what really happened in the mystery and how the puzzle comes together. The characters are well developed and the story flows very well building to a great finish. I enjoyed reading the book and look forward to reading more in the future"
4,Still relevent,"I had to read the whole thing for a reading course I did. Although it was manditory I enjoyed it. If you read all the books, although it is a lot you'll remember a lot because Schaeffer repeats his themes...a lot.But even around 30 years later you'll encounter much that is still relevent today.He's been called a 'popularizer' and I think that can fit. Not sure how well researched and founded all of his historical findings are. Take a look inside, it's worth it."
2,LOW budget but Kenya is gorgeous,"This film looks like it was shot for only 50 dollars and a hub cap. The film looks grainy and it looks like it was shot on 16MM film. The only good thing about this movie is to see the gorgeous Kenya Moore, damn she looks good. If you just wanna see her I would get this movie. But be warned there is no nudity in this movie. Ted Lange is in the movie as a bartender,I guess he thinks he's still on the Love Boat."
5,Yeah!,"Yeah I totally agree! It's just a stupid name for a type of music. I doesn't matter about what it's called, it's the music that counts. And Good Charlotte rules when it comes down to that. Their new CD is just really Benji and Joel's life experieces. I don't get why everyones arguing about what type of music they are...GC's no. 1 fan"
1,good charlotte is just pop trying to be punk,this is the 2nd worst band in the world behind simple plan. this song is awful and it makes me wanna throw up. this is just a pop band that all the teen girls say is punk. if you want real punk music you should get Offspring's Ignition. that albums spits on this pop trash.
4,An Excellent Perspective,"I had this book recommended to me because I was in the course of examining various issues concerning the interpretation of OT texts and, so far, this book has turned out to be the one that was, at the very least, best focused on the actual issue I was studying.Books on hermeneutics tend to be rather vague and formless, offering principles that are often so vague that they are of little help in actually making decisions of interpretation. I find 'He Gave us Stories' to be much more useful than the bulk of these books, besides, as I said, focusing on the actual issue I was studying."
3,Not the best product to order online,"Online ordering lesson #1267: don't order chips to be shipped unless you like small pieces! I ordered a box of 12 bags of these pita chips, and they are fairly tasty. Unfortunately, most were broken into small pieces during shipment. I don't think this was Amazon's fault -- it's probably unavoidable. If you like pita chips, get them at your local store. I also recommend Stacy's Pita Chips over the New York Style brand. They're more flavorful and slightly more salty."
2,Wolfe out of his depth,"This is the second Wolfe, and Stout is supposed to have considered it his best. I can't agree. Although Chapin is certainly a deeper character study than these books normally attempt, the psychology is unconvincing. The pure mystery part of the plot is very weak. An interesting curiousity for fans, but out-of-step with the core appeal of the series."
4,Rubinek is a good choice,"Rubinek is an very good choice for Archie, and he does the other characters well too. One of the best of the books in a good performance."
1,Take instant out of the name!,"Polder usually makes some decent products; this thermometer is not one of them! The only thing this thermometer does well, is flash a small LED once the temperature reaches a pre-determined setting. The unit takes up to 20 seconds or more to register the temperature of your food. In addition, the temperature it gives varies wildly depending the food. I ended up throwing mine away and going with a Taylor product. Much betterDon't waste your time with this thermometer."
1,Don't bother,Everything reviewer #1 said. This is a real piece of trash. We just bought it and are now getting a replacement.
3,BAD ALPHA!!!!!,"This is a great little film, but Alpha's print is just miserable to watch. More splices than you can count."
3,A Sensitive Time,"The kids all want to enlist; they're bitten by the war bug. However, they're all too young, so they do their part by harassing a local Asian who owns a store. It turns out, he isn't even Japanese; he's Chinese, and he is murdered in his store. The kids feel so bad, they take it upon themselves to find his killer, and run into an underground ring of Japanese spies.The picture quality on this film isn't great, and neither is the sound quality. After all, these films were made by a very low level company.Normally Leo Gorcey stands out, but Huntz Hall really steals the show. His kleptomania and great zingers really liven up the film. He certainly doesn't get the credit he deserves as a comedian."
3,Too many mistakes!,"I can not believe that One can make so many mistakes for such a 400 pages book. On page 12, there are 2 major mistakes which will lead anyone who is not an expert in this area to hell."
4,"Leon Morin, Priest","Ever wish that the DIARY OF A COUNTRY PRIEST priest were smarter, sexier, and healthier? LÉON MORIN, PRIEST (1961) is for you! The usually misogynist Melville convincingly shows the woman's point-of-view in this tale of sexual obsession & redemption though (gasp!) faith. Lovely score & shooting. Vignette structure using quick fades is disorienting but works. Atheists make the best Xtian movies."
4,A Surprise First Volume...,"Death's Messenger is a nice opening volume of a unnamed series, at least on the cover of the book. A quick read, Mitchell provides a stirring plot and decent characters in the world of the Warhammer Fantasy setting.The story is a well plotted travel tale of two wayward spirits accused of wrongdoings and heresy. Throughout the story, we're drawn closer to the focal characters, and can't help but feel for their plight. However brief, the story leaves us with the question of what happens next as the story hits a cliffhanger ending. Hopefully, the next volume answers the questions of character raised during the course of the tale."
3,Poor writing...Ok story...,"I have never read a Warhammer novel but have been playing the games for about 15 years, if not more, so I am familiar with the world.When I first started reading this book, I did not like it. I thought the writing was poor and the author was a little too casual and wrote in terms that are too often used. Everything about this book is very basic, from the descriptions to the dialogue to the plot. Reading this book made me feel like the author wrote it on a Sunday afternoon sometime after finishing a crossword puzzle. There were moments when I felt as if the story was coming out of its lull, hence the 3rd star for it was not a complete failure. But in the end, when you read the last page, you realize that this is just an obvious set up for the second part, which does not make much sense since the book is only about 400 pages long anyway. Over all, its an OK read if you're not looking for anything too deep."
2,The item is not good except the price,"The soup spoon is way to big, I use them as serving spoon, but who needs so many serving spoons?"
4,Very pleased,This flatware was a gift for my son and dgtr-in-law. They were delighted with the simplicity of the pattern and the nice weight of the stainless. I was very pleased that they were satisfied with my selection.
3,These must be for giants,I have owned my Oneida Bancroft/Fortune service for 8 for 13 years and love it. The pattern was discontinued and I needed more flatware for the holidays. The Prescott pattern was a deal of the day for $40 it was a great buy. Unfortunately Oneida changed the sizes of their flatware. The teaspoons and salad forks from Prescott are the size of the place spoons and dinner forks in my old set. The place spoons are the size of serving spoons. I'm considering returning this item if I find something better suited in a local store.
5,Great Buy and Value for the money,"I have been looking for flatware for over a year and this set/price can not be beat anywhere. It is well made and heavy duty plus you get lots of extras. I have compared this set to many in local stores wanting two or three times the amount for less product. I saw the other reviewers comments about not being thick and the sizes, but they didn't pay a large sum of money either. My personally opinion is you get a lot more than you are paying for with this set and I highly recommend."
5,SHP,"Not as Noise Canceling as it should be but has nice sound quality, quick deivery by vendor. Thanks."
2,wanted more dance,This was a collection of clips from older bollywood movies. I was looking for dance numbers. There was not much dance here just singing.
2,Not at low volume,"The reviewers satisfied with sound quality (esp bass) must be listening at very high volumes. I found that at higher volumes the higher frequencies were harsh and hurt my ears. At low volumes, the lower frequency response was inadequate. Of course they are different from earbuds, in which the speaker is much smaller and closer to your ear drum, but I found that the earbuds that came with my phone produced more satisfying sound at the lower volumes I prefer than these full size headphones did. The synthetic material over my ears was also to warm for me. I bought these for the 8 foot cord, but that and the great price weren't enough and I returned them."
2,"Fragile,",Too tight for my head (not that big)Sound average for a $30 dollar headphone.A lot smaller and less comfortable then the predecessor UR30Hinge Broke after 3 months of use. Dont bother.
3,alright for the price,"when these were working like they were supposed to they were great headphones. I had them for about 5 months before a cat chewed through the cord. in that time they were convenient and folded up, and sounded great while blocking a great deal of outside noise. a couple reviews have stated that they aren't adjustable. that is NOT TRUE! they adjust at the hinge. the only thing I was unhappy with was a connection starting to come loose in the volume knob. I solved this by tying it up in a knot (the cord is really long anyway) and I didn't have any more problems with it. overall worth the price, but next time I'm going with something a little higher quality like the JVC HANC100 headphones, which have a retractable cord (stupid cats...)"
1,OMG what do I like!,I was so disappointed with this headphone. I was cautious when purchasing it but then I saw a lifetime warranty..that should have been the tipoff. The headphone broke due to the design of the collapsible component. I send it back and paid for shipping I got a new one I thought okay they fixed it then the right speaker went and I was using it for a while cause I didn't want to be without one then the left one went I had to once again return it. I just kept returning them didn't even have it for a few months. It was comfortable on my ear the sound quality was good when it worked. Just think it is the company cause I bought another replacement from the same company different model and since it was cheaper it was worse. Tried Sony instead and it is a much better fit for me since I use my headphone like 24/7.
2,well...,"Bought them in March 06, they just died today and have been experiencing poor connectivity for about a year (had to consistently adjust the plug to get sound on both sides). Not a fan of the straight plug either, l-shaped is more durable, as the part that broke was due to stress on the straight plug. buying something else. also a little tight on my head, which is not large. I would pass on these. I did love them when they worked properly, but that was only for the first 6 months."
4,pretty nifty,"sound quality pretty decent. not adjustable, so i hope you have a large skull. be careful with the little plastic clasps that allow the headphones to collapse. they don't have any markings that indicate which way to push to collapse, and they give a little both ways, so you want to be extra careful to not snap them right off... seriously. i'm that strong.OK - SO I'M THAT STRONG. BROKEN AFTER A FEW SHORT MONTHS. DON'T BOTHER. THEY LOOKED COOL, BUT THEY LET ME DOWN. KOSS AND I ARE OFFICIALLY BROKEN UP. I WANT MY CLASS RING BACK, KOSS. IT'S OVER ;-)"
2,Why?...Koss They Suck!,"Check it, So I got my new headphones I had been waiting 2 weeks (free shipping deal) for and when I opened the box, I was like, sweet, these look pretty tight. Then I went to put them on, ya know, test them out, and the darned things would't fit over my big dome. I went to adjust them and i was like, they can't be adjusted! I went to lift them up and Oh snap... them things snapped!! I got mad and threw them against the wall, packaged them up, and sent them back. I still havent received my refund..."
4,Amazing for the price,"I have been using these headphones for about 5 years and have had NO problems, whatsoever. I won't bother with a long paragraph about them, so I'll cut to the chase...Pros:-Great build quality. Still fitting snug, adjuster isn't loose, and no broken parts after 5 years of use.-Very decent sound quality. I would expect this sound quality for $100 headphones, not $30.-Lows (bass) are AMAZING for such headphones. Deep and even make my jaw vibrate.-Soundscape (surround sound) pretty decent as well.-Volume adjuster is pretty handy.-They fold up very nicely and are compact.-Cable is very durable and thick.Neutral:-Cable is very long. Good for lots of movement, not good for portability.Cons:-Slightly uncomfortable for long periods of time.-Padding feels a bit cheap, but it has absolutely held up for the past years I've had them."
1,One of Koss' weakest products,"I got a pair of these as a replacement for discontinued Koss GT5s I sent in for lifetime warranty service. As nearly everyone has pointed out, they're very cheaply built, and the fragile plastic hinges on mine broke within a few months, rendering them useless. And the sound was pretty poor to begin with -- muffled highs, harsh mids, thin bass -- to the point that they don't even justify the $9 shipping and handling it would cost me to get them replaced by Koss's warranty.If you're looking for cheap collapsible headphones and are loyal to the Koss line, the Koss UR40s are a couple dollars more, are incredibly lightweight and comfortable, and sound drastically better than these UR29s. They're also slightly more durable, and backed by the same impressive warranty. Check out my review of them if you like, and stop considering these UR29s. They're terrible."
5,great headphones,"These headphones are very comfortable and the sound quality is very high. The volume control on the cord is handy. Durable material, and a really good buy all around."
3,Excellent sounding phones but not quite durable.,"I'm a DJ and I had these headphones for a year, they sound great and are easy to use but they can't handle the rigors of disc jockey, while performing at a party one of the ear cups broke off causing me to have to improvise for the remainder of my event. They are great headphones just not durable"
1,Can I have my money back?,"I read this book cover to cover before arriving in Sicily and then wondered what country he was writing about. His directions were appalling, his reviews of towns were from an adolescent perspective, his sense of Sicily was that of one of those beet red sunburned folks heading home from a week's holiday. Rough Guides, send this fellow packing! He has really hurt your reputation with us. Most sincerely, Kathleen."
5,Can anything beat Slayers? Slayers NEXT sure did!,"I've seen all three seasons of Slayers (Slayers, Slayers NEXT, and Slayers TRY). And in my opinion, NEXT is easily the best. TRY was a lot more serious (with the exception of a few REALY bizarre episodes). And Slayers was a lot sillier. NEXT blends the sillyness and seriousness excellently.Everyone's favorite characters return with better powers, cool outfits, and hilarious situations. The introduction of Xellos and Martina (along with many others) makes this season, by far, one of the best seasons of any anime ever released.Also recommended: Ah! My Goddess, Cowboy Bebop, DNA2, Full Metal Panic, Fushigi Yuugi, His And Her Circumstances, I My Me! Strawberry Eggs, Inu Yasha, Love Hina, Outlaw Star, Please Teacher, Ranma 1/2, Rurouni Kenshin, Trigun, Yu Yu Hakusho"
4,This is great but the sound is kinda bad.,"I love Slayers!!! The story is great, the fighting is great, but i have one problem and that's the sound. For example their's a guy walking down a hall right while the foot steps sounds get their before the guy's feet touch the ground!!!! That's a bad thing people!!! And another thing is when Lina is talking her mouth this moving and she isn't talking!!!! But other than a few sound problems this's a fun box set."
5,The Greatest of Slayers,"Let me start off by saying that Slayers is truely a work of pure gold. When I began watching the second season I was instantely absorbed in it. With the constant comments being directed to our leading lady Lina Inverse and her brainless body gaurd Goury Gabriev, Slayers is a anime that truely captivates a brilliant mixture of action, comedey and romance and molds these genras into a amazeing work of art. If you have seen the first season or you want to see just a bit of what the slayers anime series is, then I highly suggest Slayers Next. The series is much more fluid and crisp then the first season, but don't get me wrong, the first season was awesome to its just that the second season was better.All and all the slayer series is just a fun anime that any person can enoy if there into magic, sorcery, and a whole lot of slapstick comdedy that will have you sprawling on the floor gasping for breathe."
1,not for an iBook.,"Although this is listed as iBook memory, mine (a dual-USB) doesn't recognize it. I've checked everything I know to check, and can narrow it down to one of two problems: just a bad chip, or (more likely) that it's not compatible. According to the Apple support website, ""... some third-party RAM (memory) may no longer be recognized by the computer after installing the 4.1.7, 4.1.8, or 4.1.9 firmware updates for iBook.""They describe the problem:""When purchasing RAM modules for use in Macintosh computers, make sure that they conform to the JEDEC specification. Check with your memory vendor to ensure that the RAM module supports the correct timing modes and that their Serial Presence Detect (SPD) feature has been programmed properly, as called out in the JEDEC specification.""Since I couldn't easily locate the manufacturer (try doing a web search for ""Memory Upgrades""!) or technical information on the chip... For whatever reason, it simply isn't working."
1,CAUTION,"If you have a stereo with a 6 cd changer built into it, this device WILL NOT WORK. even though my car is the correct model year and has the right outlet in the back, it doesnt work. The paper insert actually confirms this although it said nothing about it on the profile."
5,Just what I needed,"This was exactly what i needed, it got to my house in 3 days and it was exactly as pictured, hooked up and worked great in my 04 Jeep WJ"
1,Piece of Junk,I bought one of these in December of 09 for my 04 Durango and my battery started going dead e-mailed PIE and got no response from them remounted it so I could disconnect when not in use. In November of 2011 it stopped working completely. However it did work well when it worked it is cheaply made and the durability bears that out also the PIE company is totaly non responsive
5,As advertised,Installed in a 2002 Dodge Neon and now the stereo has an input for anything with a 3.5 mm output jack.
2,could not use this,this item does not work with 6 disc CD changer (RAQ) models. this was not specified in the ad. returned it without a problem though.
4,Tech solutions,This product is a simple solution to technically disadvantaged vehicle. Installation might take a little savy but not to difficult. Highly recommended.
3,Problems,"I hooked this product up to my 2004 Jeep Liberty and on the first use, it did not work properly. Sound only came out of the passenger side speakers. Volume was very low, and when adjusted on my iPod a crackling and popping noise came from the driver side speakers. I will be returning it.Edit: I spoke with Paul, and was very impressed with the customer service. I left a message in the morning and he called back the same day. I am still miffed that the piece doesn't work, but I upgraded the review to 3 stars simply because of the quick and understanding customer service."
3,Guitar World - A Steve Howe Greatest Hits CD,"Although this CD is billed as a greatest hits CD, it is really just a combination of Natural Timbre and Portraits. On a low point they cut off the guitar solo at the end of ""Sad Eyed Lady.."""" - isnt this CD titled Guitar World. On a high point, this CD is recorded better then the above mentioned two. I bought this CD to key my Steve Howe collection complete. I cant find any other reason to buy this."
1,wrong part,"although Amazon confirmed that this product fits m y car, after I disassembled the complete front wheel and wanted to mount the new brake pad and rotors, I realized that these don't fit. So I assembled it again and sent the all rotors and pads back to Amazon. I trusted amazon but it seems their database is not accurate."
4,Enchanting,"Having spent a lot of time in the Caribbean, I was still enchanted by the descriptions of the people, the islands, and the food. I could almost smell the food and hear the people talking while enjoying this quick-read. I am ready to retreat to those blue waters again!"
5,Escape for an hour or two,"Fun read that has enough adventure to keep you coming back during the cold evenings in winter. I read this and passed it along to my mom who in turn sent it around the world. Each reader found the time to write a comment either about the rum, recipes or pitfalls of sailing down island way. If you ever thought about taking a year or two off you'll definantly want to give it a read. If you just need an escape you won't be sorry. I still pick it up from time to time just to read a chapter before going to sleep (with the hopes a caribbean dream soon to follow). If you only use the recipes it's worth it."
5,It really can happen if you want it badly enough.,"I highly recommend this book for anyone who(1) has a sense of adventure not pinned to someone elses fiction(2) wants to escape from the regular life for a year or two(3) likes to cook and or likes to eat exotic foods or(4) likes sailing and island exploration.It is not for snobby cruisers who only want to brag about how tough they are in the open ocean, how big their on-board freezer is or how much macaroni and cheese they can carry from America to foreign ports so they don't have to eat the local foods. But who cares about those kinds of closed-minded people anyway? Everyone else will love the adventure, learning and change of pace such an experience brings.This book shows you that, regardless of your limited time on a sailboat, you can go out and make this cruising dream come true if you make a plan and stick with it."
2,"An embarrassment of sailing, but great food!","Well written, nice recipes, but the sailing part is pretty boring. The writer definitely doesn't like sailing. The usual story; the husband would like to go cruising; the wife follows him and hates the sailing part. If sailing is not in your blood... don't go, catch a plane! She wants us to believe that it is all very brave what they do, but with the house paid off, a whole package of insurances and without hardly any night passage, it sounds more like a Club Med adventure. If a cruiser is fussy in finding a hair salon in port and bug-busting bleaches everything that is on board (mooring lines, fruit,..!), I can only suggest to stick to cooking!"
4,A fantastic summer read,If you love to travel you will love this book. If you have never left your home I still suggest you read this book. This came up on my kindle recommend reading list after I had downloaded The Sex Lives of Cannibals and Getting Stoned with Savages (also good travel books but for another review). I'm really glad I decided to add this one to my summer reading list. As someone who loves to cook I also really appreciated that she added some recipes after telling you about some amazing meals. I'm looking forward to trying some of them. The book never really gets dull and carries you the whole way through. It's not a difficult read. It's lighthearted but still has plenty of depth. I hope she writes another one.
5,An Embarrassment of Mangoes.,"Ann Vanderhoof has found the way to truly enjoy the Caribbean world. Going to those islands has been a life-long dream of mine. Through her books, I have been given a much richer look at this part of the world. Thank you, Ann."
4,Adequate writing on beautiful subject matter,"This is a great leisurely read, but don't expect literary fireworks. The story is simple but enjoyable, the introspection and self-awareness of the author are mildly enlightening, and the people of the islands are painted with warmth and care, but the book lacks a certain something that left me feeling less than satisfied. The writing, I believe, is the culprit. Given that the subject matter is tropical islands and a very challenging sailing adventure, there is very little actual description in this book. I wanted more visuals, more of a sensory connection to the journey and in that realm the writing simply did not deliver.The author's personal transformation from workaholic to grateful traveler is notable, the cultural notes are great, and the characters are likable.I was tempted to give it three stars, but I went with four to err on the generous side. Worth reading, but far from perfect."
1,Garbage,"I bought one of these and used it for the first time today to top off my car tires. Within minutes, this compressor began to smoke and gave out. It is marketed for vehicle tires but does not hold up. Do not buy."
4,A provocative comic exploit,"The professor who discovered the secret of invisibility, in theform of butterscotch-flavoured body paint, is at it again in thisbeautifully drawn graphic novel sequel. This time he has a nuisance to deal with, a sexy Manara girl with designs on becoming an invisible super-criminal.The story is slightly more sophisticated than in the original Butterscotch, but not so much so that it hinders one's enjoyment of the artwork.This work relies heavily on visual elements, especially the female form. Manara uses invisibility as a device to enable us to look at the female form in new and different (and highly erotic) ways.If you buy this book, expect beautiful, sensual, high quality illustrations, not deep wordy dialogue or overly complicated plots and characters. END"
3,Ahhhh...No Masterpiece,"Many of Manaras books are outstanding, not only because of his great art, but because the story is smart and funny! Ahhh...but i am afraid this one is no masterpiece. Is the art good? Yes, but even here it's not top notch. The story in this one is just not very smart...if this is the first book you purchased by Manara (and of this nature), you might like it...but comparing it to the first Butterscotch, it falls very short. Sometimes youre just going to say, 'this is stupid' and these situations hurt the book. If your looking for something nice and funny by Milo Manara, I would recomend: ""Butterscotch"", ""Gullivera"", another hot title is ""Click 1-3"", and ""To see the stars""."
5,never forgotten!,"This is a beautiful book, grasping your atention and holding your hand thru a fantastic journey into Africa, and into the chimpanzes of the Gombe. You will get to meet all of them, and even see how they are like, observing the individual diferences of their behaviour. Parents: please purchase it for your kids! Kids: get your parents to buy it for you! Inspiring! I am now 22, but I must have been 10 when I first read this book (not this edition of course!). I still purchase Jane Goodall's books...and I'm following the dream she helped inspire: to go to a place no one can pronounce to study an animal few people care about..."
5,Wonderful read for a 9 yr old,"My daughter needed a biography for a 4th grade project. She did some research and decided to read about Jane Goodall. She was sooo impressed with this book. and got an A on the project tooArrived promptly & in excellent, brand new condition...great price too"
3,"OK, Not the Greatest Though","I have much respect for Jane Goodall, but her writing is not my type. Her personal stories are interesting; yet, the numerous names of the chimps begins to get confussing. I would not read the book again."
2,crackpot egoiste,"I met Goddall when she visited our facility. Though I admire her championing of chimpanzees, I found her to be a rather self-absorbed egoiste who *liked* to emphasize how out of touch she was with mundane stuff (being so much more esoteric with her own chosen lifestyle). SHe was also a poor listener (other than to chimps) who never quite answered questions she was asked since she was on her own little self-absorbed bandwagon. Some of her comments were actually rather crackpot worthy as well. Just consider the title of this book--all about me and how austere and individual I am blah blah blah. Bless the chimps--their champs, however, are chumps"
2,Boring!,This book was so broing I couldn't even get through the whole thing. She was putting me to sleep!
2,Incomplete!,"This is one of my favorite Margret Wise Brown books, and I bought this to replace a well-worn copy from my own childhood, but I was very disappointed to discover that the new edition NOT the same as the original! It is missing the ""I like seeds/I like bugs"" page, which is one of the best parts of the book. I gave away the new copy and will be hanging on to my old one until I can find a vintage edition in good condition to replace it."
2,Digital rights management carried to self parody...,"The scores seem good, assuming you can use them. Unfortunately the screen image quality is quite poor, and the software will not let you scroll or enlarge.The user has to register online in order to print, and the software will allow you to print only ONE copy of each song. If your printer jams, or you lose your print-out...tough.There are ways around this limitation, but it is insulting that one must resort to hacking simply to exercise one's rights to fair use. Like most copy-protection schemes, this system only punishes the average user who is honest enough to buy a copy of the music.Guitarists getting into Nirvana ought to check out the *Best of Nirvana* book with CD. It's terrific."
4,"2 cool games, 1 low price","if you are a fan of surfing or skating, you will love this 2-1 pack. The pro surfer game took me a little bit to pick up, but anyone familiar with tony hawk gameplay will do fine on both games."
3,soild dash kit but some notable caveats,"This dash kit is a solid kit for the Hyundai Santa Fe. Two things to note however, this kit requires the DIN bracket that I believe comes with most head units when you by them in the retail box. You need to have it, as there's no way to attach the dash kit to the stereo. My head unit came with one when I bought it (off amazon). I did not need it for my previous car, but I did need it for this dash kit and luckily I kept everything.Also the pocket is actually designed to hold CDs (up to 3 regular jewel cases). There's fins on the side of the pocket to hold cd's as you slide them in. Great if you want to have a couple of CD's available, although they would be in the ever convenient ""steal me"" position. It does somewhat hinder the use of the pocket for other things, but I'm sure most people would be ok with it."
2,"Yes, it's very brittle","I should have read more reviews before I bought this, because after a few weeks on my keychain, the end broke off cleanly. The unit still works, so I'm going to attempt to superglue it on, but I'm disappointed.For something that claims to be washer and dryer ""safe"", it's very fragile. The hole for the keychain ring should extend through the PCB, not the soft white plastic cover. I'm glad I didn't lose my data, but I'm not sure I'll trust this with anything important from here on."
3,"Good amount of space, but.........",it's a little slow and not fast enough for Vista's ReadyBoost. If you just need something that holds a lot of data and cheap then go right ahead and buy it. The size is also ridiculously small
3,really neat little guy,"This was the first flash drive I ever bought. It sold me on the fact that it's waterproof and TINY. This eliminates all the plastic outer shell as are on most flash drives, and literally has everything glued onto a tiny piece of plastic. I've had it now for over 3 years and it still works fine, but the outside edge has started coming unglued. Expect it will continue to function just fine for at least another year or so, as the unglued edge is not the side that is inserted into the computer. Also, I have been REALLY hard on this product, carrying it around on my keychain. It's put up with the wear and tear extremely well."
2,"""World's Tiniest"" is a lie..","I use my 8GB MicroSD card in a USB adapter that is roughly half the size of this device. There is a small loop for a keychain on it which is useful when pulling it out of a usb port... not to mention that pulling out the chip allows use in a cellphone or digital camera (via adapter), digital camcorder, etc...There are smaller out there, if you are looking for small you can do a bit better!"
5,This Is AWESOME!!,I love this it is So small and easy to use and i have had no problems with it i have had it a good half a year
2,Not very indestructible.,"I got one of these in December, and two weeks later, the end broke off after a short (less than three feet) fall from my pocket while attached with the included key ring. After contacting the manufacturer, I was told that my product was defective and should be returned for a free replacement. Two months after shipping it out to them, I was told that they would not replace it because the warranty was voided. I would recommend something more durable unless you absolutely need something this small."
3,It's tiny but it's slow and it's brittle,"This really is a tiny USB key. Everyone I've shown it to has been impressed. However, after using it for several months (a) I've realized it's a really slow USB key and (b) the supposedly indestructable plastic that it is coated in is super brittle. After several weeks wearing it on my keyring the whole back part of the key broke off. I stuck it on successfully with superglue. Then chunks of the front edge of the key kept breaking off inside the USB ports that I plugged it into. If this thing was made of a more robust plastic, or even better metal, it would be much better."
4,Don't use the strap!,"Its very small, a little too small. I used the strap and attached it to my keys so I would always have it. The latch on the strap broke and I lost it within a week!"
4,Great flash drive,"This little wonder functioned beautifully, not to mentioned all the comments I got on its tiny size. Too bad I managed to loose it while carrying it in my wallet. In the course of carrying it for two months the casing became ever so slightly bent as a result of the pressure experienced in the wallet. However, I did not experience delamination issues that others have mentioned. If you can keep track of this little puppy I highly recommend it!"
4,Great Little Product,"We purchased two of these little drives. I use mine all the time and keep tons of information on it. So far so good, no complaints really. Great product for the price!"
1,Antiquated Garbage,This is the most difficult book to follow that I have ever read. it appears to be written and translated from some other language other than english. A complete waste of money.
1,Horrible faceplate,Cowgirls are horrible and so is this faceplater. A little green would bump it up a few stars.
1,CHICAGO FAN faceplates,Why arnt there Bears or Whitesox or Bulls or even Blackhawk faceplates. They should make faceplates for every team and sport
4,"Good Story, Unique, Nice looks","This is an enjoyable game that looks real nice. Its got a good story, and is easy to get into. However, I agree, the save system is useless. They put in the quick save at the last minute, but it doesn't work, so what was the point?"
2,Great graphics and fun game - autosave feature kills it,"XIII is a fun game, but the lack of an autosave feature just kills the it for me. XIII's graphics are excellent, and there are nicely done cut scenes that involve you in the story. In addition, the game plays very smoothly on my Geforce ti4200. XIII is somewhat original in that you've got to play it methodically. Running in with guns blazing will only get you killed. The game is definitely fun to play.But - and this is a big BUT - you can only save at the beginning of a level. It is extremely frustrating to play through an entire level only to be killed at the end and have to play through again. This bug makes the game unplayable. The developer currently does not plan to patch this problem. For this reason, I cannot recommend XIII. I'll hold on to my copy for a little while in hopes that UBISoft releases a patch. If no patch is released, I'll sell the game."
1,wow,"LOVE THIS GAME, BOUGHT THE D/L, doesnt work. cant get it to work for the life of me. i install it, but it still wont work. waste of 10 bucks, thanks alot."
3,"Cool Game, Lame end","XIII is one of those games that makes you think that there is hope for the computer games industry right up until the end. Not going to spoil it for you but you'll end up wondering what the producers were thinking. XIII has a comic book look to it with a first person shooter setup. The game does have it's moments and you'll have a heck of a time with the boss battles, but overall I was feeling gyped by the time I finished. I wished I had waited to pay $19.99 for this title and wouldn't have felt so disappointed at the end."
3,Good game marred by the save system,"XIII is overall a pretty good game. Great graphics and sound, a good story, pretty good gameplay. Unfortunately, it fails on one account: saving.Unlike many other people, I don't mind save points. However, XIII completely screws it up. Many save points come right before lengthy cutscenes, after which there are tough areas. If you die, you go back to before the cutscene. Now, this wouldn't be so bad, except YOU CAN'T SKIP THE CUTSCENES. This gets frustrating very quickly. I have to recommend playing on the easiest difficulty level, because otherwise you won't want to finish the game.Sorry, Ubi. It could've been great."
2,"Avoid, No Save Game","1) Although the plotting and action play in this game is not bad, the lack of a save game severely hurts this game. If you mess up, you get sent back to the beginning of the chapter, LONG cutscenes and all.2) There are lots of sneak missions (too many in my opinion).3) The cartoon/comic book portrayal can't carry the game and detracts from atmosphere and plot.It has it's moments, but I got it on sale for $9. I don't recommend you pay more."
1,THIS IS A WARNING!!!!!!,"DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this game for your PC. It is marked down for a reason. This game is causing all kinds of problems on many systems; go to UBISOFT.COM and read the PC forums. You will find many people are in the same boat. If you have a CDRW drive the game will not even install properly. Even when I did get it to work (it was beautiful by the way) it froze my entire system and my computer is not even a year old. I have a GEFORCE 4 card with updated drivers and it still crashed. Save yourself the headache and get it for a gaming platform like XBOX; you spend a few extra bucks but it is worth it. I couldn't return my copy so I sold it to some kid. You have been warned!"
1,Keeps crashing,"This game was crashing about once every 30 minutes. Sometimes the sound and video would freeze up and I would have to completely reboot, sometimes the game just stops responding to input, and I could restart it. Previously, I could get past wherever the game froze, but I've now reached a point I can't get past--it freezes in the exact same place every time. Looks like that's the end of the game for me. I'm running a pretty standard Windows XP box. I don't have problems running games like Unreal 2.Maybe it's just all the crashes, the game wasn't very exciting. The story was dull, the game play poorly implemented, the levels are __completely__ one-dimensional. If it worked well, it might be worth $30 to me. If it worked poorly, it might be worth $15. It doesn't work at all. How much would you pay for that?"
3,"Fun, but not great...","Now I think 13 looks like a pretty fun game. But from what I have played, its just that, simply Fun. What it all boils down to is a fun First Person Spy/Shooter, with...umm.... unique graphics and a decent story. Other than that it is just like any mediocere First Person Shooter, just run around and kill things. There is no real depth to the game. We will see how it truley comes to and I will deffinitly revisit this review if it is something truley special."
3,Amnesia and tatoos,"XIII sets itself apart by delivering something truly special: a comic book-styled FPS.The game's 37 missions are a mix of run-and-gun mayhem and stealth. If you slow down to a tiptoe, you can hear others' movements, which appears onscreen as illustrated visuals like tje words ""tap tap"" that reveal enemy positions around corners and through walls. Cut-scenes unfold in mind-boggling swell of animated panels.If XIII has a major flaw, it is the savegame system. Inexplicably, you can permanently save only between levels. The boss fights are also ridiculous. Why I have to fire repeatedly on old men without armor to kill them when I can kill soldiers with one or two shots is beyond my comprehension.However, this game has a lot of atmosphere and if you are a fan of the Belgian comic book, you owe yourself to try that game."
3,A unique first person shooter.,"OK, the cell shading may be the bait but the solid game play is the hook.Voice acting is well done featuring Adam West and David Duchovney. However, some of the Duchovney sequences seem stilted and robotic compared to ""master thespian,"" Adam West (seriously).One exceptional sequence has you escaping from an asylum, using nurses as hostages and scavenging for improvised weapons.Some stability issues mare the overall game experience had significant difficulty reloading the game after install and there were some installation issues with the copy guards on the 4 CDS."
3,Great Looks but poor Game Play,"I'll have to say I was excited about this game coming out. With it's awsome graphics and the fact it's a FPS I thought it was a must have. Well I was wrong. I'm not saying the game is horrible or even bad, it just has some crappy gameplay points. The thing I absolutly hated about this game was the save option. When you save during a level, then load, it'll start you over. Plus when you shoot a person it may take two shots or twenty. Even if it's the same kind of guy! I once wasted an entire clip on one enemy! I'll tell you the thing's I do like about it.1.Innovative cel-shaded graphics2.Creative weapons, you can kill someone with a chair or a flower pot3. Lots of weaponsSo, I would say don't waste forty or fifty bucks on this game, buy used for fifteen or twenty, then it's somewhat worth it."
5,A breath of fresh air,"The person who gave this game one star evidently is the only person out there with that opinion. I bought this game for my husband and he loves it. I feel that the storyline is a great breath of fresh air from the usual First Person Shooter games where you fight aliens, opposing forces, or robots. The graphics are ground breaking in the terms of this is the first FPS to use Cell-Shading. The story is taken from a comic book that was very popular in France. Xplay's review of this game is on the mark. But I wouldn't recommend this game to the novice beginner."
3,The goofy save system nearly ruins a great game.,"I just finished playing XIII and I think its great. The graphics are really interesting, the controls are easy to master and the storyline keeps one engaged (and yes, Adam West and David Duchovney are doing some of the voices in the game).I love the ""zoom-in"" cartoon panelling feature of the game; where you take out a bad guy or an enemy targets you. I liked the weapons selection - especially the crossbow. What I detested, however, was the incredibly stupid save game feature. I guess the programmers at Ubisoft created this almost useless system so that this short game would seem to last longer. Why else would it limit you to saving only at game chapter points?Despite this annoying problem, I am still giving this game a mostly positive review since I did enjoy playing it; and I really liked the ""fireworks"" scene at the end - truly awesome graphics.."
5,very cool,"I thought this game was pretty damn cool. It has nice smooth gameplay, the wicked cell shading (you can cell shade pretty much anything and it will look awsome).I didnt understand why the game took up 4 CD's either, after switching CD's continuously for a while I found out you can download an exe file for XIII which makes the game never ask for a CD again, I guess it is hacker reasons or pirating reasons that Ubisoft just doesnt do this.Also the ending was really dumb, but I didnt seem to have the problem of some people where when you save it puts you back at the start of the level. Maybe that is a console thing, I always started up at the last checkpoint.But all in all this was a really good game until the end, I was hoping I could keep playing, and expected a longer game on 4 cd's. But hey..."
1,XIII: The Game That's Lame,"Like many people who have commented, because my PC has a CD Burner, XIII would not install properly and kept crashing or sometimes the mouse wouldn't respond properly. I've tried installing it four times, and it is continually riddled with bugs.The gameplay doesn't even look that exciting anyway. I'm not impressed.Fortunately, I only paid $5.00 for the game, but judging from my experience thus far, it is not worth even that.I also think failure to have an auto-save feature is annoying.My advice if you have a PC: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
3,Not his best but still a fine project.,"Although the New York-style Salsa sound of the 1970s was over by the time ""Aqui Se Puede"" was issued in 1987 this was still a fine album. Ray Saba was a good but underrated sonero and Ray and company give it their all. ""No Me Paren La Salsa"" and ""No Te Quedes Sin Bailar"" are this one's high points."
3,Love Clarence,"I only bought it for the song ""Strokin"". I liked listening to it but I think his older stuff is much better."
1,Maybe be good for beginners.,"Well, Mrs Terra may be a good herbalist as is her husband, but this book has lots of flaws. First of all, she only writes about few herbs, means you may NOT find a specific herb in there. She give the indication BUT NOT the contra-indication of the herbs. I would recommend it for beginners ONLY!"
1,A waste of time and money,I was disheartened when I read this expensive book. All That Glitters is not a good book. No nice pictures either.
1,Horrible book; much better movie,"God, I don't know why I bothered to buy this book. It's horrible! I'm amazed one can write for so many pages and have absolutely nothing to say! God, it was torture getting through this mess. Good for Ms. Weisberger that she was able to get it published, but good grief - did anyone notice the bad writing?The movie? One of those rare instances when the movie was an improvement on the novel (and I'm talking a MAJOR improvement). I wasn't crazy about Anne Hathaway, but Meryl Streep makes the movie. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's light, entertaining and a whole lot better than that dreadful book. (And yes, I read the book first before I saw the movie.)"
4,fun! and funny,"we all knew Anna Wintour is a b*itch, but what a funny way to tell us about it! my book club thoroughly enjoyed this ride, and know we never want to work for her! insightful, first-hand experience of being a servant to a devil."
1,"To the reviewer of January 14, 2005","Ms. Weisberger's use of the term ""Jappie"" does not refer to Japanese women. It's a form of ""JAP,"" which stands for ""Jewish-American Princess."" Still derogatory, but in a different direction.Oh, yeah, and I hated this book too."
1,Blah!,"Unless you are interested in working for the fashion industry, or are already working in one, you will be bored by this book. The writer is not clever, witty, and there are tons of typos in the book. Do yourself a favor and borrow this from a friend or the library. I'm going to give my copy away when I'm done. I don't want to be reminded of the hours I spent reading this book when I could have been exploring other chick lit books."
4,Boss from H-E-Double-Hockey-Sticks,"I read ""The Devil Wears Prada"" this weekend. It says something when I can finish an entire book in a weekend, because while I read a lot, I'm not a fast reader.This was a modern tail of ""the boss from hell."" I'm not sure how the main character Andrea could have handled such a working situation for so long, but it was an entertaining ride.This book follows the vein of modern NYC comedies such as ""Sex and the City"" and ""The Nanny Diaries."" While this book didn't clinch the horridness one self-involved person can be like ""The Nanny Diaries,"" it was the look of Andrea's (non-existent) life outside of work that made this book keep going.Seriously, it's a fun read if you're looking for something lighter."
1,I FEEL MORE STUPID FOR HAVING READ THIS BOOK,"This book is so bad that it was a complete waste of time. The author discuses such juvenille issues. It seems like she used this book to showcase her knowledge of designer names. It talks about the woeful life of Andrea and her horrible materialistic boss. She devotes all her time to her work while she neglects her boyfriend and friend who is turning into a partying alcoholic. Her friend ends up getting in a car accident while driving drunk and it changes her view on her job and life. I can't put a book down once I start it, but this is the one book I wish I would never have picked up. It was so incredibly horrible. I truely feel shallow and insignificant after reading this book. I abhorred it and it is a genuinly heinous book. This author is TERRIBLE. Don't read this book!!!!"
4,Literary pair of leather pants,"I bought this book after seeing Lauren on the ""Today Show."" I happen to like this genre that so many are maligning (Nanny Diaries, Bridget Jones) You know what you are getting, if you don't like it for God's sake, spend your money on Tolstoy, non-fiction. I read the Wall Street Journal so I deserve a light, escapist read and this is precisely that. I read it during an airplane flight and sitting by the pool. It is not the best book I ever read but it was enjoyable, funny, sad and pathetic. Andrea is just a kid, she does childlike things as she aches to grow up. Sounds like me at 23. Read it and enjoy it for what it is... campy fun. I hate people who turn a pair of leather pants into something important. This is a literary pair of leather pants. Looks good, feels good, not a necessity."
2,She's a writer? This book is terrible!,"I was interested in this book with all of the hype surrounding it's publication. Then I read it. I finished it, but it was only because I was stuck on a cross-country plane ride with nothing better to do. It is very poorly written with tons of grammatical errors and oodles of redundancy. I didn't care about the main character and the secondary characters were also poorly written. Blech. What an awful book. I wish I had my money back."
3,Not Great but Entertaining!,"There was something about this book that just kept me coming back for more. It is by far not a ""good"" book, but it made me want to read it. Maybe it was the unbelievable antics that took place. I couldn't help but think about a friend of mine who has a daughter fresh out of college heading to New York as an intern with Marc Jacobs. I hope her world is better than Ahn - dre - ah's."
1,It REALLY is waste of time.,"As the previous review states ""It's a waste of time and money"". That is so true. It is entertaining in the beginning when you read of the over-the-top behavior of Miranda, but it does become repetitive. Andrea whines and complains constantly of exhaustion and humiliation, but does little to help herself. Surely, it became clear to her early on that this job would not help her land a job at the New Yorker.Andrea does not exactly come off well either as she abandons friends and family for the sake of the job. Especially, during the trip to Paris when she really needs to return to New York, she rationalizes staying. I guess Miranda rubbed off on her didn't she?Unless you have the time to waste, don't bother. The reviews say it all. Get the book at the library, sit down and thumb through a few pages and get an idea of Miranda's ridiculous requests, get up and put the book back on the shelf."
1,I think this is the only time I'll say this.......,"The movie is better! I really struggled through this one. I hate to buy a book that is not only terrible, but painful to read..... The author descriptions of characters, clothing, ..and basically throwing names of designers, and the descriptions of the attire was not chic, it was tacky. Totally not believable. ugh! How upsetting."
2,Great first 50 and last 50,"The title was the best part of this novel. Though very eager to read, i was not impressed with this book. The first 50 pages and last 50 were the only worth while pages of the entire book, and were only second rate compared with the title. If you want to read a book about a terrible boss read the Nanny Diaries, similar plot but a much better book."
3,I wanted to love it...I really did!,"When I heard about this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, it just wasn't that good. I, like some of the other reviewers, read the whole thing but just to see how she finally quit. I wanted to like it but it was so boring. It was missing wit and humor. The Nanny Diaries was similar but so much better. This book was missing the laugh out loud humor like Girls Poker Night. It was an insight into the fashion world but nothing I already didn't know from watching the movie Intern."
2,Dear Lauren....,"If you hated your boss and your job and wrote a bestselling tell all novel about the nightmare you lived for almost a year, making your job seem almost as bad as Oliver Stone's time in Vietnam, would you do as Lauren Weisberger did, and come out and admit that you, as well as your nightmare boss, were completely self involved and whiny?Lauren did.She whines, and she whines, and she whines for like five hundred pages. I wanted to enjoy this book, but it is badly written, moves at a snail's pace and spends time describing the fashion and name dropping, acts that ""Andy Sachs"" is supposededly above.The main character is unlikable, but not because she could have quit the job at any time. She's unlikeable because of her arrogance, and not just about her pretentions about being above fashion. For God's sake, there's a war going on, and she writes about Prada shoes.No sweety, you aren't Tolstoy. You aren't even Sophia Kinsella."
2,More Than You Ever Wanted to Know About the Fashion Industry,"The Devil Wears Prada is a tedious account of an aspiring young writer's effort jumpstart her writing career by taking a job with Runway (read Vogue) magazine. Her tolerance of her boss's tyranny leads one to wonder about her own concept of self worth. After reading this book, I will never lust after designer clothing."
1,A real disapointment,"Not nearly as clever as The Nanny Diaries or as smart as A Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing. Weisberger's ""literary"" style is better suited to the ""How To's"" of Cosmopolitan than an essay in the New Yorker (the main character's dream placement). Even the guilty book pleasures of summer should be better than this."
3,Good until the ending.,"I enjoyed the book for the most part. I was disappointed in the ending though, kind of felt thrown together to tie up loose ends."
3,It was all right...,"I went into this book with pretty low expectations. My friend told me it wasn't great, but it was an easy summer read. And if that's all that you expect from it, then you won't be disappointed.The author is kind of whiny, I didn't really feel much sympathy for her and her ""terrible"" job. I think that the intended effect is a ""you go girl!"" by the end of the book, but I didn't feel that way at all. The author was actually quite annoying, which obviously hurts the book.Frankly, the movie looks ten times better, if only because Meryl Streep is involved. Like I said, if you don't expect anything from the book, you won't be disappointed. It's just a fluff read."
2,Only for the NYC Fashion Crowd,I love Fashion and love the City so hearing about the designer clothes and the descriptions of living in NYC were great but other than that the book seemed a little weak for all of the hype surrounding it.
3,yes and no.,"I give this book a lot of points because it is a great depiction of the world that i live in. This IS the way the world of design works, and as someone doing my first couple of hell years in the industry I can say that those of you who found it unbelievable are clearly not on the inside of our world.OK. Having said that. The main character is so snotty. I mean I know the fashion world can suck, but she holds herself in such high regards with no respect or thought towards the creative aspect of fashion. Additionally she is incredibly one dimensional in her attempts to be a good person in a big bad world. blech.And the ending was horrendous."
4,The Devil Wears Prada,"I read this because I heard that it was not the same as the movie. And it is not. The movie was wonderful. I enjoyed the book for very different reasons. It was a little hard at first to change the visualized characters from those of the movie into those of the book. Some of them are very different, and the sub plots are also different. I love Meryl Streep.. but Miranda is a much better bitch in the book. So if you want to hear more about the bitch and you aren't too attached to the characters in the movie then enjoy this book. I know I enjoyed them both for very different reasons."
2,What do editors do?,"It's always a problem when it takes 150 pages into a book before it gets entertaining. The writing got a bit better, too. The book seemed like a rough draft with subplots like Andreas best friend Lily, boyfriend Alex, and writer Christian thrown in for good measure. The book could have easily been 200 pages. There is an obscene amount of redundency, and it is beyond wordy. I don't understand what editors get paid to do anymore. Publishers have a responsibility to correct grammar and punctuation. Ms. Weisberger should get a new editor for future ventures. I did relate to working for an insane boss. Miranda Priestley was believable and the best drawn character. I am sure Ms.Weisberger has some talent and could be a great writer."
2,"All promise, no delivery","I couldn't wait to pick it up and then couldn't wait to put it down. There were so many opportunities for humor and clever insight and they were almost all missed. The writing is flat and the characters never really come off the page. I used to think the Nanny Diaries was just okay but if this is this year's version of that book then I'm starting to think Nanny Diaries was fantastic. And finally, the dish just isn't that great."
5,Nice trip down Hypeville Lane,"This book is not a book that you can relate to if you don't live in New York and aren't in the fashion industry. It is fiction. The book is well written and the story keeps flowing.Definitely a page turner. A good fantasy book about glitz, glamour, greed and egos."
2,Skip the book watch the movie,I was really dissapointed in this book. I really enjoyed the film and thouhgt it was funny and somewhat real to our society. Then I read the book and who it was diffrent from the movie and not as good. Maybe I did not like the book as much becouse I seen the movie before I finished the book. The book was boring and I found it really abnoying. I did not like the main charactor she was selfish and anoying where in the movie she was inocent and loving. Someparts where good but not enough to make it a good movie.
3,Loved the movie,I saw the movie first and then I tried to read the book. I didn't get past the first chapter but I am sure it is good.
2,One-Hit Wonder,"Unless Lauren Weisberger, gets an amazing job really soon, I don't think she'll have too much to write about. The plot of this book turns out to be a diary of Andrea Sach's daily rituals...the problem is, they are pretty much the same, every day: fetching coffee, answering the phone, delivering the book. The only variances were that some days it was rainy, and some days it was snowing. Same ol' same ol' page after page, for almost 400 pages!Anyone who moved to New York right out of college will appreciate the humor in the absurdity of a boss' requests or expectations. Anyone in the real world will relate to having to launch their careers at the bottom of the ladder and having to pull 14 hour days.Nothing that will blow your hair back."
2,Disappointing,"This book was just a plain disappointment. The first few chapters were very funny, but then it was the same thing over, and over, and OVER again. I can't even understand how Andrea got hired as Miranda's junior assistant in the first place. By the description of what she wore on her interview, she should have been screened out as soon as she walked through the door. And what was the deal with the creepy guy in the lobby who made her sing to get into the building? Scary! And, OK, we get that your boss is a witch. Move on and tell us something we don't know. This book had a lot of repetition, no plot, and a truly horrible ending!"
2,Diary Redux,"This book is essentially the same as ""The Nanny Diaries"" but not as well written. Without giving away the plot, I can say I found it implausible that she woulda.) stay in a job where she is abused daily.b.) think spending one year as the assistant to the assistant to the editor of a fashion magazine would get her to her goal of writing for the New Yorker.At least in ""The Nanny Diaries,"" Nanny has a good reason for staying with her obnoxious boss."
1,"Makes ""Nanny Diaries"" look like Jane Eyre","I'm flabbergasted that this book is on the bestseller list. It is poorly written and edited. I had no empathy with the protagonist, and it was depressing to read about someone who cuts herself off from her family and friends because she thinks it will lead to a job at The New Yorker! Please! Don't waste your time reading this book."
2,Get if from the library,"While an entertaining idea, this book needed some serious editing. Too many dull passages, too much repetition. Not very believable in many respects."
3,Easy read,"This book, I would consider pretty entertaining but the plot was easily predictable and also the conclusion. It's a good quick summer read."
2,So boring I skipped almost 3/4 of it,"In a weird coincidence, both this book (on CD) and The Nanny Diaries (in print) arrived for me on hold at our local library the same day. It was like having two copies of the same book, both of which were boring and annoying. After reading (or listening to) about the first quarter of each book, I skipped to the last chapter or two, just to make sure that I wouldn't miss any strange and sudden surprises. I didn't. While listening to this book, I was put off by several elements: the reference to ""Jappy"" college colleagues, the narrator's inability to tell her two Indian roommates apart after living with them for a year, her repeated use of the ear-grating phrase ""as best as."" What is supposed to be so compelling about characters who have the boss from hell and are too stupid to quit? I'm glad that I didn't waste time reading both of these books in full, and that writing this review constitutes the last chunk of my time they will take up."
2,Nothing likable about Andrea...,"I picked The Devil Wears Prada in the airport for a light read while travelling on business. It could have been a really fun bit of chic-lit, but the main character is sooooooo whiny and unlikable that any of the books merit are overwhelmed. The story has some bones, and Meryl Streep will be a dynamite Miranda.Skip the book. Go see the movie instaed. Two hours of your time is all this book is worth."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"The movie is much better than the book, not that i was expecting much from Weisberger with a stinker like Everyone Worth Knowing. Thinly veiled roman à clé. Easy, shallow read, and this is coming from someone who read it when they were thirteen."
2,Not what I expected.,"This book wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either. I thought I would love this book, but didn't. It was very boring at times and hard to finish. This being said the movie is really cute and much better than the book in my opinion."
3,The Devil Wears Prada,"I guess by now everyone knows the story and has seen the movie. Fresh out of college, Andrea gets a job as a junior assistant to the devil herself, Miranda Priestly, editor of Runway Magazine. Read as Andrea jumps through hoops and over hurdles to satisfy the outlandish requirements of Miranda, while her relationships with friends and family suffer. The writing was realistic and funny in spots. I could see the frazzled Andrea clicking down the street, juggling coffee, magazines, and cell phone, giving half-hearted renditions of 80s pop songs to Eduardo in order to enter the building, and shaking in her boots when dealing with Miranda. A solid 3 star and yes, the movie is better than the book."
2,Somebody find Ms. Weisberger a better editor!,"Very poorly written first novel. A self-righteous brat finds the kind of employment she deserves, but whines, cries and snivels about it--all the way to the bank, evidently! I don't know how assisting the editor of 'Vogue' (er, 'Runway') will segue into work at 'The New Yorker', but our protagonist believes that it will. Therefore, instead of just quitting this thankless, stupid job, she keeps at it. I wanted to kick her ass all the way through the novel. I'm not sure why I finished this book. I regret the time I spent on it. I'll have forgotten it by tomorrow!"
1,A Cure For Insomnia,This book was not only slow but BORING as well by the time it picked up it was the last chapter. I'm not sure how this book stayed on the best seller list for so long but I am truly disapointed.
3,Okay book,This was an okay book. The story didn't really go anywhere. I'll let you read above for what the story is about. It was a good let your mind rest on the beach sort of book. I personally got a little tired of the million ways a boss can order a worker around. Never really beleived in the plot.
4,Fun - good summer read,"excellent book when you just need something to pass the time ... i highly recommend for flights, vacations, or lazy sundays."
2,Boring...,"The lack of any discernable plot makes this ""trying to be witty"" read...not.Read THE BIG LOVE for great chick lit."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I was looking forward to a fun read, a la The Nanny Diaries, but this book is so vile and angry, I finally gave up on page 109. The ""author's"" agenda against her former boss is very clear, yet it is delivered without any wit or intelligence. It just seems like a mean-spirited catharsis for a whiny, narcissistic wannabe. Yuck!This one will be donated to my son's online store- I don't want it on my bookshelf."
1,Repetitious and amateurish,"Miranda, fashion ogre, tortures! Andy/Ahhndrea suffers! Minor characters you barely remember have alcoholic breakdowns! I'm sorry I wasted my money on this tripe. I like dishy scoops as much as the next person, but not enough to put up with repetition, tedium, poor writing and no real story. The devil can probably afford Prada with all the money she makes from innocent readers looking for a good fun read and getting this instead. Save yours."
3,More depth and insight than expected,"Some truly funny moments but, overall, a very sad account of a woman who gives up everything that's important to her for the sake of a thankless job and an evil boss. Though she does choose her life rather than her career at the end, she's already lost a great deal. This book is really quite thought-provoking when one considers today's work centered society. What are we giving up when our career becomes our be all and end all? Really well-written with a truly hateful character in Miranda, the boss from the fiery pits of hell."
3,I wish Andrea was smarter,"The novel was nothing spectacular, but I enjoyed the insider glimpse of fashion paranoia presented therein. I thought if Andrea (the main character) could stop smoking and think for a minute instead of constantly being surprised by her boss's requests, then she might make something of herself. Instead of anticipating, she worries and moans about the dream job 'a million girls would die for,' a phrase I hated by the end of the novel. I was able to think of easy solutions for a great deal of her dilemmas, such as scheduling agenda leeway for late flights, expensing an old-style non microwave food warmer, and hiring a taxi cab driver for the day. If you have a practically unlimited expense account, use your imagination, girl, and stop the whines."
2,Gets monotonous,"The book starts off as being fun. If it were half the size, I would probably rate it higher. Its basically about a neurotic boss, but after a few chapters, you get the picture. But it goes on and on, with nothing new to offer. A very lame plot towards the end. But its highly predictable, and you feel as if you're just reading complaint after complaint and frankly, starts getting irritating."
2,One trick pony ...,"This book was easy to read and fairly well written. It gives an interesting, voyeuristic view of the fashion industry. Parts of it were laugh-out-loud funny, but this single theme book grows a tad tedious. I kept hoping for the protagonist, Andrea, to give her boss the comeuppance, but it never materialized. Instead it takes a very long time and a contrived tragedy to make Andrea have her obligatory light bulb moment. This book was overwrought and too long yet somehow fairly entertaining. 2 1/2 stars."
1,Go See the Movie,"This is one of those rare circumstances where the MOVIE is so much better than the book. The book is poorly written and whiny. The screenplay for the movie took the basic premise of the book and turned it into what the book should have been -- a story with two sides and a lesson instead of an epic ""feel sorry for me because I had to work hard"" memoir."
2,Left It,"""THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA"" seems to be a love it or leave it book. Turned out to be not my cup of tea. I only got through about 1/3 before I cut my losses and donated it to the library book sale. A better choice would be ""TRADING UP."""
4,A Trendy Devil.,"<u>The Devil Wears Prada</u> is a fabulous book if you enjoy looking in on the life of one of the many slaves of the fashion industry.""Ahn-dre-ah"" is a typical woman fresh out of college with aspirations of writing for The New Yorker. You see her drastically transform from grounded to fashion-conscious after she is assured a job as Miranda Priestly's assistant at Runway magazine will ultimately get her what she wants.It's no literary masterpiece but it's a fun romp worth reading in your spare time."
2,Two and a Half Stars,"In reading over the reviews posted here, it seems that people are very bothered by the shallow, materialistic protagonist. I didn't necessarily get that impression and besides, if every character was likeable and exuding righteousness, we'd never have had some of the great literary heroes and heroines. That being said, Andrea Sachs doesn't fall into that category and the book itself was largely a disappointment. I had no expectation of lofty intellectual reading, but some semblance of plot would have been nice. Every aspect of the story was completely predictable and the characters were rather poorly developed. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this was a waste of money, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone either."
3,hilarious and entertaining,"I enjoyed reading this book more than I thought I would. Initially, I thought it would be a vapid, self-indulgent tale of the 'Boss from Hell' but the book's genuine warmth, wit, and humor quickly won me over. Reading it, I shudder to think that the author based this book on her actual real-life experience as a fashion assistant. Parts of the novel really resonated with me, such as Andrea's aspirations to become a writer and her post-collegiate lifestyle. However, there were times when I found Andrea to be too spineless for her own good. Why does she tolerate so much psychological abuse from Miranda? Why did it take her so long to finally stand up for herself? The conflicts also seemed to be resolved a little too quickly. Miranda, as was to be expected, was typically detestable and inhuman as a boss."
2,"Light beach read, nothing more","This book is an easy read, but that's the best thing I can say about it. If you liked The Nanny Diaries, you'll like this book. If you've never read The Nanny Diaries, ask yourself this question: would I enjoy reading a book about a super-powerful, self-centered New Yorker who treats her young assistant horribly? If the answer is yes, go ahead and order this book. If not, good for you! Now order something worth your while, like The Secret Life of Bees."
5,AWESOME STORY,"I have watched this movie about 25 times. IF you are only reading, or watching the action, you have missed the whole theory of this book/movie. And yes my dear, I am 57, and this stuff in the 21st century STILL goes on. The term ""personal assistant"" means just that, running errands, getting coffee, and yes even picking up dry cleaning.Everytime I see this movie I pick up another subtle unlining point in this movie. It is about changes, it is about seeing someone underneath their weight/clothing and seeing their potential.You almost need a Masters degree in Psychology to see all the things going on in this movie/book.Rarely do I watch a movie, then read the book, I can tell you after seeing this movie, I am looking forward to reading the book, this story is AWESOME, IF you can see what it is REALLY about!"
3,I would have given this 3 1/2 stars,"I enjoyed the book, some parts were really funny, like when Eduardo made Andrea sing and dance to enter the bldg!All in all a very enjoyable read, bordering on fluff, but still with a very good ending!"
4,"An entertaining, easy read","If you're looking for an entertaining mildly stimulating read for the bathtub or the beach, this is the book for you! It is definitely a ""smart"" chick lit book; no ditziness, and there are real problems presented in the book. Anyone can relate to the insanely infuriating boss in this book! Enjoy! :-)"
4,"amazing, but cut off","The author is clearly talented, once you read this book you have a new out look upon the fasion world. Andrea Saches starts by working for the famous Miranda Priestly, but things don't always turn out to be so peachy. This book demonstraights the high world of fashion. Although the author did a stunning job, she short cuts the book, by not ending its sub-plots. I think it left me wondering too much what was in store for the talented, whitfull Andrea, or as Miranda would say it An-dre-a.P.S. I hope for a sequal"
5,Just too funny!,"This book was probably about the funniest one I have ever read. For someone like me who is into the latest fashion and trends and work amongst these same kind of people, had a completely crazy boss in the fashion industry,I could totally relate. There were times I was laughing out loud!I guess if you don't know what ""M.J.'s"" are, or how much a pair of Manolos shoes cost, then you probably won't ""get it""."
4,Another Great Beach Read...,"Or a great camping read as was the case here. Ms. Weisberger captures the essence of sheer horror clothed in the guise of Miranda Priestly. One wonders, as Ms. Weisberger did work for the top fashion magazine, are the editors and employees of such publications that brazen, cut-throat and cruel? How much of this is based on her personal interactions at Vogue?At one time or another, most of us have encountered a boss that reveals some aspect of the devil incarnate in his/her management style. As one reads, one cannot help but think of ways to retaliate on the character of Ms. Priestly and that makes reading this book fun. It is great entertainment, not rocket science. Enjoy."
4,I liked it!,"The Devil Wears Prada was a fun book. I eagerly read to find out what Miranda Priestly would do next. However, I often wondered why the assistants didn't just ask for help when they didn't understand a request. It seemed as though alot of the tension and stress could be resolved if the girls just talked to Miranda and worked it out. HOwever, if they had done that then there would have been no story. Overall, it was a fun book that made me appreciate my boss."
2,Ho Hum,"I guess you have to be a New Yorker. It's not that funny to me. There's a lot of hype about this book, and I thought it was going to be funny like David Sedaris' books.There are more entertaining books out there, like Hasket's DUNCAN DELANEY'S CADILLAC OF DOOM, OR Sedaris' NAKED, OR Orozco's DELANO."
4,Great Read,"I loved reading this book. It was funny and unbeleivable. It reminded me of The Nanny Diaries, only a lot more enjoyable. If this book is only partly true about the woman that Ms. Weisberger used to be an assistant for, she should be embarrased and ashamed. For anyone who is remotely interested in fashion, it will entertain."
4,Loved it,"Funny, witty, and everything that an easy summer read should be!Thanks to this book I even found myself slightly interested in fashion which is a huge accomplishment! Bravo.This is, obviously, not a book to sit and analyse- just read it and enjoy the mishaps and suffering of another human being which is, this time- not you. Phew"
2,"Could not finish, having seen movie.","Saw the movie version of this about a year ago and found it to be sappy and disappointing. I thought I'd give the book a go, as usually the books have much more depth and interest than the movies they spawn. Sadly, this was not the case for the Devil Wears Prada. As I read the book, I felt like I knew it all already (even though I have heard the book has a different ending to the movie...?) and since I didn't find the movie particularly interesting, I was not finding the book to be either. Couldn't justify continuing on with it when I have so many other great looking books waiting for me!"
2,:(,"Even if there was no movie to set my standards, I would've found this book to be a let-down. My love for the movie is probably the only reason I finished the book, considering it took awhile for things to get moving. Anyway, I know most people who saw the movie first and then read the book didn't like it, but I wanted to give it a try! Booo - so sorely disappointed! The characters in the book are by far less developed and likable. I thought Andrea in the film was whiny and annoying but yikes, book Andrea makes her look great in comparison. I also found Miranda's evilness so two-dimensional - we didn't get to see more of her to understand why she's this unbearable, which would've made for a much more interesting villain instead of a flat, predictable one. And the (kind of) worst part is that the writing style is baffling - it felt amateurish and got wordy and repetitive a lot of times. :( I didn't have very high expectations but geez, they still weren't met!"
3,funny but not literature,"The Devil Wears Prada is Lauren Weisberger's first book, and details the experiences of Brown graduate, Andrea Sachs in her first job as personal assistant to the high-profile, fabulously successful Miranda Priestly, editor of Runway magazine. The book is said to be based on Weisberger's time at Vogue, working for Anna Wintour. This book is pretty funny and is probably quite an accurate picture of the fashion industry, especially the ostentation and the obscene waste of money. Literature, it isn't; it is, basically, a litany of the progressively more outrageous demands made on her staff by the editor of a top fashion magazine and a tedious catalogue of brand names. The editor is painted as a cold-hearted, demanding, unreasonable monster; her staff are portrayed as anorexic image-obsessed minions without personality. This book confirms for me why I care nothing for the superficial world of fashion."
3,Entertaining but not great.,The book is entertaining but not great. I watched the movie before hearing this audio book and for the most part I like the movie better. It definitely plays well on the big screen particularly with the high fashion.I did not like the narrator's way of reading the book aloud. Many times she got the inflections wrong thereby changing the way the story was heard. It was just plain inaccurate.
3,Movie's better.,"I read the book after seeing the film and enjoyed it, especially the details about Miranda's life choices and the fashion industry. I kept thinking, 'Are there really people out there this arrogant?'The film is a nicer ending - the book is, shudder to think - an embarrassment in that Andi does exactly what Miranda figures she'll do - and with absolutely no class. All I could do was feel disappointed.I'm sure Miranda ( Anna Wintour ) didn't blink an eye when Lauren W. quit her job - she couldn't care less about anyone who doesn't worship her.I suggest if you enjoyed the film to read 3/4 of the book. Then fill in the ending with the movie ending."
2,waste of time,"I was excited to see that this book had finally been released on paperback so I picked it up immediately. However, it was very disappointing. The book is a 400-page rant from a selfish, boring character that we've seen millions of times before (think blonde, blue eyed, naive, small-town girl..) The author writes as though she is an expert in her field dishing the dirt - meanwhile the info in this book is common knowledge and there are even some things I find incorrect. Also, it is not particularly well-written or articulate. The author tends to go into such detail about daily trips to Starbucks but briefly mulls over entire months of the protagonist's life.It may be a cute read for younger women or those who are really curious about the fashion industry."
3,pretty good,"I must say that this book was a VERY easy and QUICK read...it is easy to get entrapped in Andrea's world and be eager to find out what exactly Miranda will make her do next without even noticing you have read 50 or more pages. However, I was VERY disappointed by the ending-all the things that made the book interesting and kept me turning the pages were suddenly just dropped and never mentioned again...in an exceptionally substandard ending."
4,A Fun Read!,"I thought this book was great! The author, Lauren Weisberger has great character descriptions...and really portrays the ""Boss from Hell"" that most of us can find a little something we can relate to. Andrea, a fresh out of college 20 something- is trendy, witty and subjected to a cruel stint working as an Assistant to a big Fashion Editor, Miranda Priestley- who is demanding, picky and snotty.The book had me from the first page...and continued to entertain me with Andrea's adventures and Miranda's outrageous requests.:) Definitely a great summer read!"
4,Very cute,I really enjoyed this book. Very light and humorous read...even though at times you can actually feel Andrea's pain and exhaustion. I would recommend this book for a fun vacation or beach read.
5,Far superior to the movie!,"This book was an excellent and enjoyable read. It flowed smoothly and was an unchallenging, pleasant and humourous read. I read it and then watched the movie. My advice would be to read the book and not bother with the novie; it has been seriously dumbed down for the sake of giving Meryl Streep more lines. The movie also loses much of the integrity displayed in the book which is quite thought-provoking on the subject of human behaviour in many areas, despite being light and airy in its approach. It does make you marvel at how materialistic and detached from reality some high-flying business persons really are. I felt happy to be ordinary when I had read it. Enjoy!"
2,This Prada was a knock-off,"I have been in constant anticipation since I heard about this novel a year ago. So needless-to-say I was psyched when summer rolled around and I was able to pick it up and devour it.The book began well but that's it. 100 pages in I was still waiting for character development and a tangible plot. The entire book was one huge rant about how bitchy Andrea's boss was. I felt like saying, ""OK, we know this - now please move on.""Unfortunately, the scenes (and demands from the boss) were unbelievable (even by chick-lit standards).However, it was funny (maybe because the bitchy demands from the boss were sooo over the top). It is something to read if you have nothing else to read, but this book does not live up to it's NYTimes Best Seller List push.This book should not be compared to Nanny Diaries. I've read Nanny and I loved it ten times more than Prada."
4,Hysterical!,"If nothing else, this book will make your own awful job look a whole lot better. What made the book funny was the fact that these characters were based on real people. It's hard to imagine someone so crazy could really rise to the post of editor in chief of an internationally known magazine. This is not great literature by any stretch but it is entertaining and full of crazy, funny people and situations. I thought I had the job from hell in a prior life but this poor girl truly had the worst job on earth. I think this job will appeal to all fashionistas and wannabee's as well as anyone who is now or ever has been an administrative assistant. Your own psycho boss will seem a lot more sane after you read this book. Oh and just for the record, I cracked up when I opened the June issue of Vogue magazine and saw that the editor in chief's favorite place to vacation was Oscar de la Renta's home in the Dominican Republic and included a picture of a skirt she wore for dinner. Hmmmmmmmm."
1,"I'm bothered by many things in this book, but what bothers me most...","...is the fact that Lauren Weisberger perpetuates some openly racist stereotypes in the book. Was anyone else offended by her portrayal of the two Indian girl roommates, who sleep in twin bunk beds, have no personalities or lives to speak of, and (I can't believe she actually says this!) smell like curry? Weisberger, who considers herself to be too intellectual to care about fashion, even makes fun of their business suits. WTF?"
2,surprisingly not well written...,"how fast must this book have been pushed through editing? sweet fancy moses. there's an interesting story to be told here, but it's all told so woodenly that i can't imagine anyone getting very excited over it. i'm in publishing, so of course i was curious about the book; but it only takes about 3 hours to read. for this kind of ""inside scoop,"" the nanny diaries was really much better.it didn't make sense that the heroine was supposed to be so ""fashion clueless"" and yet was able to name-drop (Bungalow 8, Nobu) right from the get-go. how did she get this job again? for pete's sake, even i know how to pronouce Givenchy, and i'm from Cleveland.the non-""Runway"" stuff was so incidental to the story that i mostly skimmed over it. i think this book would be fine on the plane or the beach, but otherwise...not memorable."
1,Bottom line: Weisberger would make a better gossip columnist,"Though this book arguably has some meaty content, Andrea's character does not get developed enough for readers to care very much about what happens to her. From the very outset, she seems flat and uninteresting, much like the loafers she cluelessly wears her first day on the job. The only real jewel in this novel is the ""Devil"" herself. Miranda's outrageous character and her equally outlandish antics are the glue that holds this messily written book together, and once Andrea storms out of her bitchy boss's life, the novel no longer interests or stirs or even seems worth continuing. A nice effort, and a certainly phenomenal level of success for a first-time writer of questionable talent... however, Weisberger would do herself a favor by honing her writing skills a little bit and coming up with original material next time, rather than a nasty tell-all gossip-fest about the very visible fashionista we all know this book is REALLY about."
1,"Darn it, I liked it!","I'm almost ashamed of myself, given the bad reviews posted here, but I enjoyed this book. Perhaps I can identify because I've worked for a real nut--no matter what I did, I simply COULD NOT please this woman, although I must admit she was no Miranda Priestly. Could Anna Win--umm, the person upon this was supposedly based, really be that bad? If so, how is she still in the business? Anyway, while the book certainly isn't great literature, it is a decent beach read."
1,Very shallow reading,"I could have cared less about the wants, needs, and desires of a fashion magazine editor who is so vain, shallow, and self centered that I could vomit. I felt nothing but pity for poor Andrea - the main character and my stomach would clinch up in anxiety with every absurd and ridiculous task that was put before her. This is not a relaxing, funny, good read. The whole time I was reading it all I could think was ""Is this really worth it?"" Surely Andrea could have found a different way of achieving her goal to work for ""The New Yorker""! This was far too much like ""The Nanny Diaries: A Novel""."
1,WORST PIECE OF WRITING EVER,"This was the worst piece of writing (if you can call it that) that I ever read. Of course, Ms. Weisberger is laughing all the way to the bank....Do NOT BUY THIS BOOK. See the movie this summer instead and save yourself money and time that can never be regained."
1,Rubish,"If you prefer a story with depth, or clever turns of phrase, or any substance whatsoever, please don't waste your time or money on this one. Even my teenage daughter found it boring and too unbelievable to enjoy."
1,Boring,"I am almost done with this book and I really wish it would hurry and end. I do not like it at all..it is boring and I do not like any of the characters. Usually when I am enjoying a book I cant wait to pick it up at nite..this one I dread picking up...but since I started it, I must finish.Do not recommend it."
2,I Prefer Miranda,"The only character that was worth anything to me in this book was Miranda. I wanted to know more about her only. I can't say I ""liked"" her but the other characters were just boring. Even their catty comments. Something was missing, not being a writer I can't say what exactly. But as a reader I know something was missing. it was ok."
1,Excruciating,"Satire has a long and distinguished history, and everybody, deep in their heart of hearts, probably enjoys seeing nasty, arrogant megalomaniacs get their comeuppance. But it only works if the person doing the satirizing has 1) SOME kind of moral authority, 2) A razor-sharp wit, and 3) the ability to see him- or herself somewhat objectively. Weisberger displays none of the above in this lame bit of opportunism. I found myself rooting for Miranda. Not a good sign.Prose that would be dripping red in a decent Freshman comp. course, cardboard characterization, a storyline that goes nowhere. Luckily I got my copy free from a friend who warned me not to waste my time reading it--if only I had listened. I would recommend you not make the same mistake I did, or compound the mistake by actually paying money for it."
2,Fashionably Lame!,"I bought this book, simply, because the title caught my eye. A lover of fashion, but not a slave to it, it was quite interesting to get a glimpse into the world of high fashion and what really goes on behind the scenes. Overall, the book started out okay, but it went totally flat in the end.In otherwords, I was looking for something really juicy and got nothing in return. No need to re-hash what all the majority reviewers, thought. If I had to say one thing, I'm in total agreement with the folks that caught all of the grammatical errors in the book. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me.Highly suspicious from a Cornell Grad!"
2,Not as good as I thought it would be...,"OK - this book starts out with the girl not knowing how to drive a stick shift makes her sound whiny and spoiled. Throughout the book this attitude prevails. Women are portrayed as weak, all having eating disorders, and they can't dress."
2,A Let Down,"I was looking for something kinda fluffy and funny. Well, I found myself finding the protaganist whiny, unrealistic, whiny, self-righteous, whiny, self-centered, and did I mention whiny?A college grad with a high profile job has to do some scut-work - boo hoo. She's lived a life of privilege, and seems to suffer the typical compensating for feeling inadequete by sneering at the haute couture world.Yes, Miranda is unreasonable. So are lots of other talented prima-donnas in every profession. Yet again - Boo hoo.The resolution was drivel. The implication that our protaganist has found what truly matters, and that standing up for her principals has served her is trite and difficult to swallow. The ending reads rather pompous and self-congratulatory. Oh wait, I believe that would describe the tone of the entire novel.This one is going to my local used book store, because it sure isn't a keeper."
3,Whiny protagonist,"This book had a lot of promise. Like many others, I eagerly anticipated it's arrival, the first couple chapters certainly drew me in as I have friends who work for Conde Naste (aka Condescending and Nasty) and I know what they go through. But the problem is by the end of the book I found myself skipping paragraphs of Andrea's constant whining, it became very stale very quickly...other than that it's amusing reading. I'm surprised Anna Wintour isn't suing the author!"
2,Amateur writing style killed it for me,"This book never would have gotten published if not for the dishy promise: Former assistant to a high-profile fashion editor writes ""fiction"" about....an assistant to a high-profile fashion editor. I only bought the book because I used to work for a big women's magazine and I was curious to hear her take on that world. As far as the dish goes, that part's pretty entertaining--and I don't doubt that the author culls from her actual experience, because all the parts that don't concern Andrea's dealings with Miranda are laughably lame and two-dimensional. I enjoy light beach-reading as much as anyone, but I believe a book can be fluffy and fun yet still smart and clever (like Bridget Jones' Diary)--and this isn't."
2,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is just dreadful!","In this ""novel"" Lauren Weinberger trashes her boss, ""Vogue"" editor (and fashion diva extraordinare) Anna Wintour while trying to convince us the readers that she is poor innocent in this mess of a novel known as ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Although entertaining at times it often gets boring and VERY choppy in content and direction. Rathar than trash her boss Lauren Weinberger should have taken some writing lessons. Like the fashion industry this book is shallow. To Quote Anna Wintour ""That's all"""
3,a decent book for the beach,"this book was fine at first, i loved the ny references, being a native. it was mostly alot of fluff though, nothing substantial. the beginning was better than the end. it got progressively more stupid. yet, i enjoyed it for what it is, a fun empty headed read when you're not in the mood for anything more solid."
4,"Clever, Engrossing Read","""The Devil Wears Prada"" was a complete hoot. If you liked ""The Nanny Diaries,"" you'll love this book. It's got the same insightful commentary on a rarified social group in NYC (fashionistas replacing the park avenue mothers) with an even wittier edge. Lauren Weisberger's eye for detail and the absurd creates a story that's hard to put down. In fact, I couldn't - just spent the entire day engrossed in this novel, rooting for Andrea to triumph over the wretched Miranda. Hope you enjoy it!"
2,Disappointing ...,"Maybe I expected too much due to all the hype, but I found this book disappointing. I didn't hate it or throw it down in disgust, but, really, what's the big deal? I recommend skipping this one."
2,This was a boring book....,"This book was a great dissapointment. What I wanted was a light, funny read. What I got was a semi-depressing bore. I had never heard of this book, or of the hype others had mentioned. I was bored and needed a book, ran to my nearest warehouse club and bought this. I think back and I bought it because it seemed similar to The Nanny Diaries which I found interesting and very funny.Andrea is NOT a believable character. She is saccharin sweet and a bore. We are lead to believe that she is a saint and doesnt deserve such abuse. Well QUIT!!! That is what I kept thinking through the whole book! QUIT, QUIT, QUIT!! And she should have followed the old addage ""If it is too good to be true, it probably is"" referring to her interview and job.Also, the whole looking at the woman and the fashion world down her nose with disdain,but, managing to ""score"" high priced items was so annoying to me. I just felt the ""saint"" Andrea was a hypocrite and was begging to be a doormat."
1,Not good!,This book has gotten a ton of press and I thought I would really like it. But it's terrible! The book is not well written and the content is fluffy at best. It goes on much too long with almost nothing new to say. Don't waste your time or money on this book! Go see the movie; I heard it was much better.
2,I was rooting for Miranda,"Miranda Priestly, as shallow a character as she was, was infinitely preferable to the ridiculous Andrea, who was also about as deep as a raindrop in her own snotty way. The whole novel was based on Andrea's whining (both interiorly and exteriorly) about how she wanted to quit, but couldn't. How she wanted to quit, but couldn't. How she wanted to quit, but couldn't.If I typed that sentence five million times instead of three, that woud give you the idea upon which this novel was based.I thought it would be a good book to read while sitting by the pool, but I was wrong. It just wasn't all that interesting. I suppose if I really cared about the real-life world of Anna Wintour and Prada and Hermes and blah and blah and blahblahblah, it would have made more of an impression on me."
4,Actually motivating,"This book had a strange effect on me. I was quite bored for the first 7 chapters or so but then all of a sudden, I was taken into the life of Andrea and felt like I was living her nightmare. I felt that the writing hit home with the type of story I like to read. It was light, yet brought you away from reality (at least my own). On the other hand, it made me realize, it could be kind of cool to experience something like that. To work so hard to get what you really want. I also think that if this story was changed a bit it could make a rather fun and interesting romantic comedy feature film. The one thing I had wished for throughout the book was that Andrea would have ended up with Christian. Bottom line, there was not much of a plot but the story about this girl's experience was really good and fund to read. You need to like that kind of book to like it."
5,Greatest Book!,"The Devil Wears Prada was a great, hilarious book! I highly reccomend it, it is very well written and lets you share in Andrea's stress, anxiety, excitement, and fear. The insight to the incredibly high class world is interesting as well."
2,A little boring,"This book was a little too long and very repetitive. Even though the story is interesting, it felt like the book would never end."
2,it's no Shopaholic,"While I enjoy fashion and try hard not to love all the books based on women's obessesions with clothing and that strange, fascinating world, this book left me yearning to read a book about someone I actually could relate with and feel for...like Bridgette Jones or Shopaholic. The book was a slow read, especially since the author skipped around so much and many times dragged on when describing for instance her friend's makeup suitcase. I didn't pity the main character Andrea once, and couldnt understand why she stuck out the job as long as she did. She had no solid proof she would be working at the New Yorker after one year. When I forced myself to finish the book, I thought the same thing as a previous reviewer said...I was looking for more of an ending, for some gaps to be filled, and was left with a blank page."
2,Easy Summer Read,"I read this book several years ago. I thought the book was just OK. The characters were developed well and the story line was believable. However, I did enjoy the movie more."
1,"Great Title, Terrible Writing","I expected this book to be witty and entertaining. Instead it was a tedious slog through awful writing and a banal story. Who cares if Anna Wintour is a nasty boss? There are lots of nasty bosses. The heroine is so oblivious that she doesn't bother to learn to tell her two roommates apart. She claims to want to write for the New Yorker, but she should count herself lucky to get hired by the local Pennysaver.Could I finish this book? No."
2,I ended up rooting for Miranda,"This book started off well enough but after awhile I began to empathize with poor Miranda Priestly. I mean, here's a hard driving, high-powered, highly successful woman who obviously got where she was not by making friends with her many assistants, all of whom see her as a stepping stone to greater things anyway. And she knows it. And who wouldn't get impatient with a prying personal assistant who knows nothing about fashion, could care less, and who lets the boss' lunches get cold and keeps her waiting for coffee because she needs to have a smoke or call her boyfriend and best friend, both of whom are losers? Although I tried desperately to be sympathetic to Andrea, her great drive to be ""liked"" made her, in my view, extremely unprofessional and excrutiatingly annoying. She was complaining and f-ing up on the job all the time and should have been fired immediately."
2,Where is an editor when you need one???,"I expected this book to be light entertainment. However, I still expect storyline consistency. First of all, the boyfriend cannot have a 6 year old child in his 4th grade class. There are more ""minor"" errors, but hasn't anyone noticed the most glaring? At the end, the roomate is in two places due to storyline problems. First, the roomate was there, next shes still drunk, passed out in bed. This drives me nuts!"
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"This was not a very good book. After hearing that it was a best seller I knew I had to read it. First of I knew not to really take this book seriously as it was written in a humorous manner. Now, even though we all feel for the Andreah because no one wants an evil boss. But, in the real world she would have been canned the first time Miranda realized that she was not ""Cut"" out for the job. Also, there is no way that they would have let her keep those clothes. This book was just all about clothes, make up and ""Clackers"". Save your money it's not worth it. I give this book a serious thumbs down. All three of the ""Shop-o-holic"" books were better than this one book combined."
4,Good though stuck with a mediocre ending,Andrea's tale is one we all can relate to: bright eyed and just graduated from college in search of the career launching first job. in a bright beautiful city. Sounds great until you add the boss. Weisberger paints a brutal but honest tale of what everyone on the outside sees as a great job but in reality is not all that it is cracked up to be.Excellent writing and attention grabbing though I really think that the ending is rather abrupt. It was a fun read and I could relate to the characters and their turmoil as my job takes the me out of me very often. Good beach book or rainy day book. Relatively quick read and laughs along the way.
2,Just Ok...,"This book was just ok... nothing special but good if you're looking for an easy-to-read novel to take up your free time. It was rather funny in parts, but too much ""telling"" really makes you feel as if you are trudging through most of the narrative. Nothing special, very repetitive and I'm surprised that it was a bestseller for so long."
2,What a letdown,"Gratuitous use of the ""F word""Really disappointing ending...but what might be worse is by the time I got to it (they could've trimmed up the middle for sure), I could only care so much."
4,Live a little!,"I loved this book! It kept my attention and was def. interesting. Yes, she could've expanded on her main character's love for writing and the ending could've been thought out a little more, but all-in-all this is a great read and hopefully an inspiration to everyone that has a less-than-desirable boss."
3,"Saw the movie, now have read the book","After having seen the movie about 100 times, (don't know why I liked it so much!!)I decided to read the book. I think the movie left me wanting MORE. I have to agree with one of the reviewers previously, when they stated that the ficticious book was mostly about the author. The nastiness regarding her boss, Miranda, was too far and few between for me, esp. since in a world such as hers I'm sure there was plenty to write about. I really would have enjoyed reading more about how Miranda was such a witch of a boss, and all the dirt and gossip, of which there probably was plenty. All in all, it took me 2 days to read, and left me wanting more nastiness from her boss.The Devil Wears Prada"
4,Don't spoil the book and see the movie first.,"There were definite changes in the movie that weren't in the book. Great ""memoir of a devil-boss"". Just make sure you read the book all the way through before seeing it on the big screen. You'll appreciate Meryl Streep's stellar portrayal and better understand this cold-hearted boss."
2,The movie was much better than the book,"I saw the movie (Meryl Streep, Anna Hathaway) before I read the book. The movie was fantastic. The book: not so much. As I walked out of the theater I felt repulsed by high-fashion fabulousness -- at the same time that I wanted to head to Nordstom for a new outfit. But I found the book annoying. Meryl Streep brought the Miranda Priestly character to life more than I could do in my own imagination, and the Andy Sachs character in the book was more of a weeny than I could tolerate. My recommendation: rent the move from Netflix."
4,Not just for women...,"The dilemma of ""Do I alter things about myself in order to please my superiors?"" is not only a question for females. In fact, I tend to think that males are more likely to take the ""I'm going to wear what I want and I don't care what anyone else thinks"" approach to attire, and thus are more in need of pondering the initial question. I am not necessarily advocating that they should make changes, only that they think about it, and that they think about the potential benefits and consequences. This is not just a fun, funny read. It can impact your persona at work, and thus your relationships at work. Even if you're a male.I know this because I am, in fact, a male. Except on Tuesday evenings. Just kidding."
2,repetitive,"entertaining most of the time, but the same scenario every time...got a little old..The author writes well, but this story should have ended after 200 pages."
3,Interesting for gossip-seeking readers,"While the writing style of Ms. Weisberger is energetic and engaging, the book remains a superficial read. If one is to believe Ms. Weisberger's claim (made on her appearance on the Today's show on NBC) that she wrote the book to provide an insight into fresh college graduate's experience on her first job, then this book is interesting (even though 99.9% of all graduates will have different experiences). What this book lacks is an in-depth description of the actual fashion business -- and Ms. Wiesberger apparently had unprecedented access to important sources. Regrettably she dwells on the idiosyncrasies of her boss' lunch orders, schedule, office politics and the like, leaving one to think what an intresting book this could have been had Ms. Weisberger taken the opportunity more seriously."
2,All Buzz and No Book,"The only possible reason for reading this book is to see if Anna Wintour stand-in Miranda Priestly is the worst boss ever. She is. However, unlike The Nanny Diaries, this book is so poorly written that by page 300 or so, you couldn't care less is Miranda had her young assistant Andrea drawn and quartered. There are a collection of characters so poorly drawn, serving only to satisfy the author's whim at the moment, that any arc is rendered flat and you find yourself waiting for the next Miranda outrage, which, after the twentieth one, is no longer shocking. Is Emily a back stabbing co-worker or a comrade in arms? Will sweet boyfriend Alex dump job-obsessed Andrea? Does funky best friend Lily have a drinking problem? Will Andrea survive this job to make it to The New Yorker? Who cares? After reading this book, I promise you, you will not care. Watch the final season of Sex and the City and you'll get the same fashionista flush as you had hoped you'd get from this pitiful book."
2,"rant,rant,rant","This book started off fun and then you realize that all this girl does is rant and complain...all the time. By the time you reach the middle of the book I didnt think her ""monster"" of a boss was mean enough to her. MY GOODNESS...keep this character and the author quiet."
1,[weak],"ms. weisburger can't write. it is a tragedy that so many talented writers are unknown and poor and a [person] like her has so much recognition. it's hard to care for her protagonist when she complains about the fashion world yet simultaneously eats it up, and her caricature of her boss is more schlocky than convincing. but of course, she gets a job at another publication, where her editor worked for the very same monster the book is about. how convenient. ..."
1,"Cute cover, catchy title, but not worth your time","I'm about 1/3 through this book and came to check out a couple reviews to see if anyone else felt the way I feel right now about this book. I'm relieved that I'm not alone. I bought a used copy at the bookstore by my house, thinking I'd enjoy a nice, ""flip"" summer read, but all in all, I'm pretty disappointed. I feel like I could have written this book in a weekend, and I don't know squat about fashion. There's not much plot here, and really, not much point from what I can tell, and I'm on page 152.It's got some cute parts, and then some really ridiculous parts (when the lame-o security guard at her building requires her to sing Spice Girls and Madonna before he'll let her pass, I literally rolled my eyes).I'm quitting now based on what I've read here. I think I've actually gotten just a little dumber reading this novel."
2,A nothing book - boring and trite,"I am going to save you some time here:1) Young college grad (Andrea) aspires to work at The New Yorker Magazine and settles for a job at a fashion magazine called ""Runway"", working as an assistant for the fashion editor for one year (you are now on about page 20)2) For the next 200 pages we learn that the boss is a bitch.3) Then the last 30 pages have Andrea realizing she has made a mistake....4) Trite ending.Miranda was a devil, but this book is so totally devoid of creativity that I found myself wondering why Andrea didn't quit her job sooner, and why I hadn't stopped reading this book sooner as well!Miranda's antics go on and on for over 200 pages and it gets totally boring and repetitive.Skip this one. Not even a good airline trip read.How do books like this stay so long on a best-seller list?It frightens me to think about that question."
4,Hysterically funny!,"Hysterically funny and a wonderfully entertaining as you look inside the world of Broadway and New York LOL! Light hearted fun and an extremely easy and quick read I am off to see the movie shortly! I had not heard the hype before the book came out, so I am not disappointed as others seem to be.Very descriptive and believable with great comic lines and rifts. Take this on the plane or train to keep your mind from going crazy over the commute and you won't be disappointed. If you were looking for more of a gossip, behinds the scene look, you will be disappointed so don't bother. If you are just looking to get away from reality, this is the book for you."
1,save your $20,"this is a truly awful book. boo frickety hoo this undeserving college grad's boss will not allow her spend all day on the phone to her friends. why the hype? it seems entirely unclear having actually picked up the book to read this second rate attempt at ""fictional"" writing. by the saccharine sweet end i wanted to get andrea sachs her much desired job at the new yorker just to watch her squirm in misery as she was dismissed due to her total lack of literary talent."
2,See the Movie - Skip the Book,The Devil Wears Prada has compelling plot about a recent college grad's first job working for an evil fashion editior maven. That ends what I thought worked well in the book.What didn't work well was the immature writing style which smacks of 6th grade girls' notes to each other; the thinly developed characters (especially Miranda who practically shows zero favorable traits) and the humdrum subplot involving the boyfriend and best friend. I honestly nearly fell asleep during these parts and fast-forwarded to the interactions with Miranda.Skip the book and watch the movie instead.
2,A BOOK THAT REALLY PORTRAYS IGNORANCE,"This book was very good in the fact that the writer was able to bring out my emotions towards the characters in the story. Mostly disgust for Miranda, and anger towards Andrea for allowing anyone to treat her with such utter disrespect. It definately captured the feel of NYC and the fashion industry, and gave the reader the feeling of stress that accompanies that lifestyle. (I actually had to put the book away for a day because just reading it stressed me out). Those things are all good, however I was very disappointed that as witty and intelligent as the main character, Andrea is, she showed complete ignorance by stereotyping ""anyone who lives below the Mason Dixon Line"" as a dumb Southern Redneck or hick. I pretty much lost all respect for both the book and the main character when this began to surface. It pretty much ruined the whole book for me and negated any redeeming qualities."
2,Similiar to the Nanny Diaries,"This book is very similiar to the Nanny Diaries. It was fun to read, but the ending was very predictable. The writing was fair. It is a book to read if you have the time and are looking for an easy, not too complex read."
4,"Fun, Easy Read","OK, so we know this book isn't going to win any awards,however if your looking for a light,fun,easy read this is the title for you. And I did receive more then a few looks while giggling on the train at some of the antics that Miranda pulled on Alex. We have all had a boss someplace in our lives that have done similar things, so we can all relate to poor Alex. However, you have to read it to the end to end to see what becomes of the characters. Throughly enjoyed reading this book, and kudos to the author."
3,"A fun, light read","I admit this is not one of the best books I have read, but I definitely enjoyed getting engrossed in the life of Miranda and Andrea. I read the long book in a couple of days and never felt bored with the plot or characters. The sub-plot of Andrea's relationship with her boyfriend, Alex, and her writer/crush, Christian, didn't seem to flow with the rest of the book (and got on my nerves a little), but overall it was funny to read of the horrible fashion editor and her smartmouthed assistant. This book is fun - not intellectual - and I really liked how it ended."
3,"""A delightfully dishy novel""","That's what the blurb on the jacket says, and that's what this is. Funny at times, certainly exaggerated, and always very glamourous, it was an enjoyable little novel. Yes, it places a terrific emphasis on fashion. That's because the action takes place at a fashion magazine! (The jacket mentions Prada, Armani and Versace, in italics, no less.) Yes, it's superficial and gossipy. Novels that proudly describe themselves as ""delightfully dishy"" generally aren't known for nuance or subtext. Weisberger is a much better, more talented writer than Candace Bushnell, to whom she's been compared on this board. This book is nowhere near as good as NANNY DIARIES. But it is what it is -- a little tome that's easy to polish off and makes you feel better about your plain little off-the-shelf life."
1,Lousy Ending,"I listened to this book. It started off fairly good, but totally fell apart at the end. I'm glad that I didn't purchase this, because it really isn't worth the money. It's like the author couldn't think of a good ending for the book, so she just tacked on anything... it leaves one feeling very unsatisfied."
2,Didn't live up to the hype,"So much hype surrounded this book. It was on the NY Times best seller list forever! I for one do not think this book deserved all of the recognition it recieved.For one the novel is FILLED with annoying typos, misspellings, and grammar errors ( as I am sure many of my own reviews are, but this is allowed because I am not a published author ;) ). That really annoyed me to say the least.Overall the story wasn't to bad. I mean it started out funny then got old quick. The characters were underdeveloped so it was difficut to get involved in the story being told. The secondary characters were mere snipbits and were practically useless.Bottom Line: The Devil Wears Prada is utterly dissappointing. While I didn't hate it enough to not finish I have to say having seen in on the bestseller list for so long I was hoping for more."
2,More Boring Than Funny,"I just didn't get this book. Didn't see what was supposed to be so funny about it. Andrea came across as a whiny complainer who, although she kept stating her fight against fitting in with the New York fashion world, seemed to secretly crave and yearn for it. She's also a masochist who consistently let someone mentally abuse her and came back for more. All under the guise of trying to move up into the journalistic world. Sheesh.There were parts that were humorous, but more were just boring. I didn't like the way the author rambled on and on and on, searching for that one-liner that would bring a laugh from the reader and never quite getting there."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"After hearing about this book for ages, I decided to give it a try. Really, what is everyone all gung ho about? The character is unlikeable, although she obviously thinks that she's got the brains of a rocket scientist the way she looks down on everything and everyone around her at her job. Her relationship with her boyfriend is just plain old boring. The boss is a walking stereotype. I would have given this one star, but because I couldn't even make it through the entire book before I got bored and sick of the nauseating characters, I figured that wouldn't be honest because I don't know if the entire thing is bad - but most certainly the first half that I read wasn't worth all the press."
1,"Pure, whining drivel (& not good drivel)","Unless you have lived the author's life, this is a truly tiresome book. It may hit the spot for 23-year-old women who are intimate with the fashion scene. For the rest of the population, it's a waste of time. The characters are badly drawn. The main character, for instance, is supposed to be smart and feisty. She dreams of writing for The New Yorker. Yet she chooses a year of exhausted humiliation over relying on her assumed intelligence and determination to secure her future. As a reader, I get that she is exhausted and that her job is rotten. That comes across loud and clear, but the author never moves on. There's no relief, no sense of the character actually growing or changing. Instead one long whine ends with the character acting as poorly and selfishly as those the book presumes to castigate. I'm not far from 23, I remember what it was like to begin working, but please...show us you can grow up or don't waste our time."
3,Entertaining coming-of-age tale,"I picked up this book expecting a woeful sob story similar to The Nanny Diaries that would do little more than reassure me about my own unglamorous career choices. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed following Andrea's day to day experiences and meeting the characters she discovers in the fashion world. I thought the depiction of an arrogant Ivy League graduate discovering her own ignorance, incompetence, and ultimately, empowerment, was true-to-life and even inspiring. As beach reads go, this was a pleasant diversion, even though there were a few threads left hanging (what became of the stuttering travel writer? And where are things left with Christian?) I would recommend this book to those who will identify with Andrea- give it a read if you are recently graduating from Stanford and choosing between Morgan Stanley and writing the police blotter in Evansville, Indiana."
1,Don't believe the hype.,"OK, so it's got a nice cover and got some good reviews, but come on! It's boring, and who cares about the main character? It's hard to get behind a character who hates and complains about everything yet is a toal hypocrite since she acts just as poorly as the people she bashes.Fashionistas - in the same category - is a MORE ENJOYABLE book. The story is fun and the writing is witty and humorous. I actually laughed out loud through most of the book."
2,We were all young once. . .,"I agree with the general consensus that the book had some fun parts, but was generally way too whiny and predictable. By the time I was 2/3 through I was mentally done with it.My point is that from the point of view of someone in her 40s, I can really, really see that it was written by someone in her 20s. The continuously preachy and annoying message that it is just SO wrong to expect anyone to do any personal tasks for you (even if you were told that was the deal when you were hired) and SO disgusting - so incredibly disgusting - to touch someone else's laundry. . .ya know - I just do think that titans of industry should be able to use their time for something else. And that we all have to pay our dues.So I guess I'm not in my 20s anymore. And I could tell that this book was written by someone in her twenties. As they say - beautiful to look at, but we're really not interested in what they have to say. More talented writers excepted, of course."
2,Complaining does not make a book,"This book was one of the worst I've read in the last few years. Filled with designer jargon and the incessant whining of the main character, it was boring and a nuisance. Unless you enjoy people incessantly complaining about their boss and how much their job sucks, I really wouldn't recommend this book. The other thing that bothered me was the pure hypocrisy of the main character, Andy Sachs. She complains about the girls she works with and then becomes one of them. Maybe the book didn't describe things enough, but I also didn't think that her boss was that horrible and so her complains and whining just fueled my annoyance.If you want to know the storyline, rent the movie. It's a lot better and more worthy of the money. I saw the movie after reading the book and I thought it was much better than the book and was actually worth my time."
1,She only wishes she were Kinsella.,"Lamest of all chick-lits. Good thing I didn't actually READ the book - I got the abridged CD - ugh. (long commute home) I got so fed up with the main character being a weak little spoiled ivy-league brat. This story proves WAY too many stereotypes about ball-breaking NYC women, and all the while the author thinks dropping random designer names is going to make the reader swoon. gag.This was so boring, I returned it for cash. Don't waste your time. Read anything by Kinsella instead for a better light chick-lit read. In fact, if someone ever gives you this book and says, ""I was totally reminded of (fill in the blank)"" or ""You'll love it!"" - you should be offended!"
4,The devil is great,"I wonder if all the bad reviews on this book are from people in the fashion industry...hmmm..in any case, this book is never marketed as 'War and Peace' as the author puts it. It's a light read-perfect for the summer or a cold winter day. I think most people can relate to the boss from hell and kudos to the author for having the guts to write this book. I tihnk we can all relate to being a lowly assistant treated like garbage. The best revenge is success--and this book is certianly successful. so if you're looking for a light summer read, and can relate to having a boss from hell--you'll like this book."
1,Did not live up to the hype,"i had heard of this book through magazine reviews and while i have read similar books (shopaholic series- quite funny), i was very disappointed. I certainly didn't think it warranted the 300+ pages that it was (<200pgs more appropriate i think) and i felt the author was was too descript on fashion items and not enough on the story. I kept reading the book in anticipation something exciting/unpredictable would happen (it never) and finished it thinking that as i don't work in fashion, maybe there were a few fashion in-jokes that I didn't get (giving it the benefit of the doubt). In all i agree with other reviewers that it's a beach read, but the length of it makes it too long to recommend it(who reads 300+ pgs at the beach, if you do i hope you wear sunscreen!). Read this book only if you have a LOT of time (which i have at the moment), not to satify curiousity (as i did) because you will end up disappinted."
1,Stunt Move,This book just cashed in on its back stage access. Poorly written and the character was not likable. The Pop Star synchronization of book writing.
4,fun fun fun!,"This is not a book that uses all your brain cells to understand what's going on. That said, this is pure reading cotton candy, fluffy and sweet to the brain tastebuds. It is a book that you can pick up and just tear through in a couple of days. Poor Alex, you want to just scream at her ""QUIT ALREADY!"" You may not learn from it, but you certainly will be entertained by it. So, if you're in the mood, this book is for you."
2,Too familiar,"Having worked for a woman very similar to that described in the book, albeit in Interior Design, I felt great sympathy for the main character, Andrea. There are some truly revolting people out there, and frankly you are better off getting out early on -I only spent 6 weeks there, as opposed to the year the main character put in - and this book was giving me horrible flashbacks.Apart from the similarities to my experience (which meant that in a lot of ways I didn't really enjoy the book as it brought back a lot of bad memories), I found the book shallow and fairly glib - there was no soul searching at any point except the end, and then that was fairly over dramatic. In addition, the novel was quite poorly written - ungrammatical and mostly consisting of ""conversations"" rather than descriptions. Reads like a screenplay."
1,A book for someone who likes picture magazines.,"The greatness stops with the title. This is part of a new genre of literature built around the success of Sex and the City and aimed at young women who dream of living in New York and wearing $1000 shoes while making $30,000 per year. It is mildly entertaining (emphasis on mildly) for escapist reasons, but I wouldn't put it in the category of a guilty pleasure. It is fun to think you could get a job where you have access to unlimited priceless designer clothes for free by pure luck, but that is about the only fun fantasy this book perpetuates. Unhumorous & boring. If you want to dream about wearing Prada and Versace buy a copy of Women's Wear Daily."
2,Amateur Hour -- Pageturner but nothing else.....,"OK....everyone who has an evil job out of college fantasizes about seeking revenge against their vile boss by writing a tell all novel. Did Michael Lewis start this trend I wonder?So I guess Weisberger is a bit more motivated than most since she actually finished her tome of revenge.Other than a window on wintour's obsessive ways, this book is pretty useless. And Weisberger's portrait on the back just makes the narrator smack of hypocrisy. With that absurdly perfect blowout we are supposed to believe that she's a happy go lucky bohemian intellectual right?????? Oh I forgot! It's not autobiographical. Yup!"
2,One Complaint After the Next...,"Initially, I thought this book was going to be a fun light-hearted read. I was disappointed to discover that rather than being adventurous, this book was nothing more than a long list of whiny complaints made by the narrator, Andrea. There is never a moment when Andrea is actually happy and content, which eventually drains the reader and contributes to the fact that this book is just one big headache. I only finished due to curiosity, but the ending is so predictably anti-climatic that I found myself feeling no emotions at the end. Save your time and read something fun with a rewarding ending such as I Dont Know How She Does It by Allison Pearson."
1,BORING,"I found ""the Devil wears Prada"" to be a bit boring. I admit that I am a sucker for the recent glut of twenty/thirty-something tales of making it on the world but the plot was nonexistant. I kept waiting for something REALLY aweful to happen and Andrea would save the day and finally get her job at the New Yorker but no...nothing. This book feels more like the author complaining about her days as an assistant to the Vogue editor than a novel. Weisberger tries to add some other characters such as Andrea's pregnant sister but it fails miserbly to take the reader anywhere. Weisberger should have just stuck to writing a memior about her days as a fashion editor's assistant. Also, I think that this book was poorly edited. I found a few grammer mistakes and many sentences that felt out of place--as if they were supposed to be edited out but got forgotten. Leave this book on the shelf where you found it."
1,Author doesn't know how to write,"I love the movie that was made based on this book so I had very high hopes for the book. Unfortunately, I was devastated to find that the author doesn't know how to write a book. She jumps all over the place, with a lot of ""remembering back"" moments. Now I know why the movie was made to be so different from the book. They are hardly the same in any way other than the very basic story line involving the Editor in Chief of a major magazine that is bossy and demanding. Seriously, I would save your two cents on buying this book if I were you."
4,Nice to get your mind of things...,"The book is entertaining. it's not as hilarious as some critics said it would be but if you are looking for a fun and light story to get your mind of things then this is the book...it did not keep me awake until the early hours of the morning but I enjoyed reading it. It is well written, interesting characters, good pace of the story. Get under the duvet and enjoy this book ! (and don't forget the box of chocolates!...)"
2,What a letdown!,"I was thrilled at the thought of reading a book about high fashion and a mean boss. When the movie previews started airing, I decided to read the book before seeing the movie. Don't bother! The writing is mediocre, and the story - wait, there isn't one. It is a quick read, but I think that's because you're desperately waiting for something to happen. And when you finally get to the end, it's as if the editor said, ok, wrap it up in the next 10 pages. The ending is totally dissatisfying and well...dumb. I have heard the movie is very fun though, and that Meryl Streep is amazing. If you're considering reading this book, I suggest you skip it and make a bee-line for the nearest movie theater instead."
2,The book that never ends,"This book starts out great. It's cheeky and funny.. but this books big problem is that the plot is to thin. So, your boss is crazy.. then what? The answer to this is nothing! That's it.. the book is about an evil boss and that is all the book is about. There are no twist, no mystery, no nothing... After about 200 pages, the jokes gets old and you just want it be over.."
3,Invigorating yet dull....,"I picked up this book after all the hype of the movie (I wanted to read it before but it was hard to find, now it was a movie it was a myrid of places) and although I sat through the tribulations with my butt at the end of the seat (well, in a matter of speaking because I was lying down the whole time i was reading)..but as it began to end the excitement went flat..yes her SPOILER tell off of Miranda was great..but after that..dull, dull, dull. The ending was canned and left me with more questions then answers. The book needs to be resolved.That is all."
3,Not everything has to be Hemingway,"As a trashy novel, this isn't half-bad. No, it's not social satire on the level of Tom Wolfe, but as long as you understand that and accept it for the mind candy that it is, you might enjoy it. No, it has no discernible plot. No, it's not particularly well-written. Yes, the dialogue is rather pedestrian. Let's face it, it probably wouldn't have been published if it weren't based on a real-life person, but that's half the fun of reading it and it's an entertaining read, a guilty pleasure like a fast-food meal that you allow yourself to indulge in once in awhile but that would get nauseating if you ate all the time. It's totally disposable.And I thought the ending was perfectly fine, I have certainly read far worse endings than that (um, the Da Vinci Code?)."
2,Boring...,"This is a complete copy of the Nanny Diaries with less subadtance. if you want a quick funny read, read the Nanny Diaries instead of this imitation."
2,"Painfully similar to ""The Nanny Diaries""","I was almost embarrassed for the author as I read ""The Devil Wears Prada"" due to the fact that the exact same story was written last year by the co-authors of ""The Nanny Diaries"". I felt like I was reading the same book, only I had a much harder time identifying with Andrea, the protagonist in this book than I did Nanny (Diaries). I found myself wondering if it was just bad luck that ""The Nanny Diaries"" got published first, or if the author of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" actually knew of the prior and shamelessly copied those writters style."
1,"no plot, no point, no style....","Although she was given an enormous opportunity to work alongside some of the most eccentric, talented, influential, and fashionable people in the world, Lauren W. failed to capture her experience on even the most obvious level. The biggest problem with the book is that it doesn't say anything - lists of tasks and errands do not make for fascinating reading. The characters at the magazine are oversimplified when seen through the eyes of our narrator, whose snotty attitude prevents her from seeing deeper than the designer clothes. This book is just a bitter tome written by an angry girl who cashed in on the name of the woman who employed her - employed her when no one else was offering. Unfortunately the narrator's insecurities about her lack of ""perfect hair, perfect shoes,perfect body..."" prevented her from seeing anything at the magazine other than that."
5,"""A book a million PEOPLE would die for...""","This book kept me up ALL night. I couldn't put it down! Laura Weisberger's glimpse into the fashion industry left me wanting for more...Miranda Priestly, Editor of the hottest fashion magazine ""in the world"" is the epitome of the ""Evil Boss Syndrome"" and Andrea Sachs gets the job ""A million girls would die for"" as her personal assistant.The Devil Wears Prada is Laura's ""slightly"" fictional account of her own days at Voque working for the very real, Anna Wintour.If you're looking for a page-turner, then look no more. This book is funny without being over the top, heartfelt, clever and always refreshing. If I could read it again for the first time all over again, I would!"
2,The Devil Made Me Do It,"I'll admit it - I read this book for the hype. They're making a movie, the title's catchy, it's a best-seller, blah, blah, blah. By the third page, any reader can see where the story is headed. The main character whines and complains her way around New York; all but abandoning those who love, support and need her the most for the sake of her first job out of school. A job, as we're reminded incessantly, ""any girl would die for."" The ending is no surprise - but so long overdue, to say it was anticlimactic is an understatement. Please don't get me started on the author's writing style and tone... My friends and I wrote better notes in high school.Here's a newsflash: most jobs suck. In fact, most jobs suck, aren't in NYC and don't lend expensive designer clothes to their employees. This is one case where I'll bet the movie is better than the book. It really is the only hope for redeeming this drivel, I mean novel."
2,I'm way too old for this book,"In fact, I was way too old for it when I was 21. Sorry, I can not recommend this book. The characters are not developed very well. I feel absolutely no sympathy for the heroine who, if old enough to live on her own and take on the world by storm sure as heck doesn't have any self-respect or common sense. It seemed like a good idea for about 50 pages and then fell flat. I basically just skimmed the remainder to find out if anything ever really changed. For the most part, it didn't , the only character that seemed to have any growth in this book was one that had been on the peripheral during the entire novel. This book flew against the face of realism, ridiculously so...even for a piece of summer fiction. If you have a limited amount of time for your summer reading list, as I do...and you are over the age of 19 with your self-esteem and common sense fully intact, take a pass on this one."
3,"Quick, Funny read","I really enjoyed ""The Devil Wears Prada"". As a college student I like reading about a recent college grad and her efforts to survive her first real job. The only thing I didn't like about the book is it made me want to buy an entirely new wardrobe of designer clothes!! Other than that I would suggest this book as a quick read that provides some laugh out loud moments."
4,Entertaining,"An awesome book, stereotypical but it takes you into the world of glitz and for a second you get the live what you thought was teh dream. I consider it the best out of all PR, hollywood, fashion, secretary books. Its a fun read."
3,entertaining but lacking substance,"The book kept me reading, which is a good thing. I'm not a person who reads alot. It was a nice book for the time being, but I don't think I'd read it again. Once I finished the book I was left thinking, ""Is that it?"". I guess it's all in what you're looking for. If you want a book that is entertaining and fun to read then this is a good book. If you're looking for a book that you'll want to read over and over again, one that builds suspense and provokes feelings, then this is not a good book for you."
2,Didn't Live Up to the Hype,"So much hype surrounded this book. It was on the NY Times best seller list forever! I for one do not think this book deserved all of the recognition it recieved.For one the novel is FILLED with annoying typos, misspellings, and grammar errors ( as I am sure many of my own reviews are, but this is allowed because I am not a published author ;) ). That really annoyed me to say the least.Overall the story wasn't to bad. I mean it started out funny then got old quick. The characters were underdeveloped so it was difficut to get involved in the story being told. The secondary characters were mere snipbits and were practically useless.Bottom Line: The Devil Wears Prada is utterly dissappointing. While I didn't hate it enough to not finish I have to say having seen in on the bestseller list for so long I was hoping for more."
2,Baby Fishmouth is Sweeping the Nation,"Weisberger's follow-up to her 2001 debut ""God Wears Pajamas"" is full of faded ideas and tattered characters. In ""GWP"" she invented a St. Peter who hands out p.j.s at the Gates of Heaven. Portraying God as an advocate of the happy nap was an inspired idea, and it elevated this reader's conciousness to levels not achieved since I first read Camus. In ""Prada"", however, the gag of Satan forcing new arrivals to don uncomfortable garments seems contrived. So you didn't get into Heaven and now you have to sleep in golf shoes. So what? It's impossible for the reader to connect the dots when Weisberger offers fewer than you find in a typical elipses. While dissapointed, I still look forward to next year's final installment of this trilogy, ""Buddha Wears Von Dutch""."
1,Don't waste your time or your money.,"If you must read this then get it at the library like I did. This author is presumptuous to believe she could ever work for a quality, albeit fairly generic publication such as the ""New Yorker"". She writes the way I talk, which is an endless nervous babble to get all my thoughts out in a short timespan. Really, this was a big waste of time, and whenever anyone asked me what it was I was reading, I replied ""a junky book""."
1,Absolutely Awful,"What a piece of garbage! I couldn't even finish reading this sad attempt at fashion fiction. The 'heroine's' sadistic attitude towards the poor puppy in the first few pages put me right off.The prose was forced, overly dramatic and unimaginative. The author seemed to be trying too hard to make her protagonist interesting, amusing, funky and cool but only proved to make her boring, repetitive, uncool, immature and throughly unlikable. Don't waste your time on this book. I'm amazed it was even published! Poorly written, ungrammatical, loaded with excessive adjectives,pretentious and very disappointing.A very silly book."
2,Disappointment,"Twenty-three year old Andrea Sachs dreams of writing for The New Yorker. Fresh out of college, she lands a job in Manhattan as assistant to the powerful Miranda Priestly, editor of the successful fashion magazine Runway. Although her writing abilities won't be utilized, all Andrea hears from everyone she meets is that she's landed the job ""a million girls would die for."" Supposedly, ""people who worked for Miranda got places."" The position is more of a college-educated messenger. But if Andrea can hang in there for 1 year, she's sure to get a great promotion. However, 1 year as Miranda's personal gopher won't be that easy. Miranda's like Cruella DeVil from Disney's Dalmatian movies. She's insensitive, demanding and just ""cruel.""This had the makings of a hilarious book, but just failed to pull it off. Better luck next time."
2,Disapointed!,"I am a very avid reader of chic-lit. I really look for novels that particularly deal with clothes or the fashion industry. Sadly, The Devil Wears Prada does not go on my recommendation list. The plot was dull and I was just reading it to get the book done with about halfway through!! You just keep thinking ""Ok she hates her boss, so quit already!"". There are some funny parts blended in with the overall dullness but you won't catch your self shedding comical tears any time soon. The story was a good idea but not good enough for over 300 pages!! I want back my [money amount]I paid for it!"
2,BLAH,i read the book because it was highly recommended by a friend. It started off good but i honestly feel that she ran out of things to say and just started repeating everything over and over again. I honestly believe that the book can be summed up in 20 pages. There is no plot at all. I wouldn't recommend it. just read the first few pages and it'll be the same things as if you read the entire book.
1,A Must Not Read,"Lauren Weisberger's, the devil wears prada leaves a lot to be desired. If you really must read this novel do yourself a favour and read the back cover and place it back on the shelf. What was the purpose of this book anyway? This novel was on the best seller list for six months? What did I miss?This novel is 360 pages of babble about a character that we know absolutely nothing about from a character we know little about. Someone should have told the author that void of a great plot, she needed to have, at a minimum, compelling characters. In the case of writing the devil is in the detail."
2,Another 'chick lit' novel with no substance,"Am I the only one to be getting sick of $15 novels that have nothing going for them but a silly, paper-thin storyline, references to Manolo Blahinks and 'hilarious' encounters with boyfriends/boss/best friend/dog? How dare people compare this and others *coughshopaholic,bergdorf blondes cough* with Bridget Jones Diary, which is more romantic comedy-style literaure then 'chick lit' (Men find it just as amusing as women.) and a good read to boot. The devil wears Prada is wooden, naive, stalls/starts and is so see-through it might as well be gossamer. ""Beach read""? yes, if you borrowed it from a friend or you *really* want to drone out, but this book doesn't let you drone out, its actually hard to read because of the way its written!"
2,Clever title...a repeat through,"This book has a glamourous title and a fable of a girl who takes a job without realizing what it really entails. Nanny Diaries was actually more realistic and believable (i.e. there are probably more nannies in the world than assistants to a top fashion magazine editor).Good: Escapism and then suffering of the heroine who finally realizes what she wantsBad: Frantic subplots and suffering of the heroine for no discernable reason other than she is too dumb to leave. The nanny diaries, at least, you understood why she stayed in her job (loved the kid).Final: If you are into suffering, this is it. Otherwise, I enjoyed this month's issue of Vogue better.p.s. figured out that with her salary and the profits from the sale of her wardrobe and other perks, she came out pretty good for less than one year of work!!"
1,Vulgar & Crude,"I may be a little prude in this day of ""sophistication"" but I found the book vulgar and crude. I am in two literature groups and am used to reading and discussing many books but this book is the crudest book I have read in all the years. I loved the movie and so thought the book would be good. I am not into filthy language and animalistic behavior. The movie made me like the main character but the book portrayed her as a crude and base low class type character. Skip this book but see the movie."
3,A Guilty Pleasure with a truly wicked villain,"I think Lauren Weisberger is probably not too upset with all the snarky reviews, since The Devil Wears Prada has been a solid hit seller. There are no great revelations here, but it is a quick, fun book to read. It could have done with a little more narrative drive and some judicious cutting, but hey what do you want from a beach or subway book?p.s. Every time I see a picture of Anna Wintour since reading this, I think of the devilish boss in this book"
2,Will do??,"Maybe it's a little thing, but I found it irritating and implausible that Andrea and her friends use the phrase ""will do"" in response to the snooty orders they issue each other. These are supposed to be struggling 20somethings and they come off as arrogant and unlikable. The Nanny Diaries is basically the same story but is much, much better written."
3,Perfect summer reading,"It look less than a day in a beach chair in Hawaii to finish this fun, trashy read. It's the perfect mindless read for summer."
1,UGH!,"What a total waste of time. The author has NO aidea how to develop her characters--they were cardboard cut-outs. She did not give ANY detail about what Andrea's life was like before she interviewed at "" Runway""( except for drifting through Europe and Asia with her boyfriend) I rather liked Miranda, at least her antics kept me guessing about what outlandish stunt she would pull on Andy next."
2,"Mmm, promising material but...","Overall I found this novel disappointing. All the ingredients were there for a really satisfying satire/morality tale but they just never came together with the oompf they might have had in the hands of a more sophisticated writer. The heroine was not all that sympathetic, the villain not evil enough, plot lines either obvious or reiterative, climax really flaccid and unsatisfying. A few more drafts might have made a difference. A good book for a rainy weekend or day at the beach."
3,This book could of been...,"This book could have been so much more, but it was just too much superficial for me. It is so material oriented and has big designer names dropped left and right like its the only thing in the world that the person cares about. The book was too much about the world Andrea lives in that what she feels and human emotions. I give it three stars because the style of writing was quick and slightly witty. It flowed nicely but towards the end the story was too much of the same thing over and over. I got bored by the end since the same thing was happening over and over. The ending wasn't what I expected because it was too simple and didn't satisfy what Andrea went through. There wasn't a bang, just something simple. Maybe it's how life is...or maybe the story isn't that great.It was a fun light read...but not completely satisfying as other chik-lit books. Too much work, not enough life."
3,Amusing. That's all.,"While not a great read, this was especially appealing to me because I used to work in the industry. I can relate to everything she depicted. I've seen it first hand. A fun summer beach read."
1,devil wears ungrateful,"i hated it, and not because it's chick-lit, or because it's stupid, but because the main character is SO unlikeable. Andi Sachs is a chain smoking, ungrateful, selfish girl who wants to be a serious journalist. Instead, she takes a job at Runway, the fictional Vogue. Ignoring the fact that it is a multibillion dollar company, and Miranda is the head of a HUGELY successful company, she spends most of the time saying how much better she is than a fashion magazine. It seems like Lauren Weisberger is bitter about her seperation from Vogue, and has decided Miranda is the villian, despite the fact that Miranda is a much more interesting character. Watch the movie instead: it paints both Andi, and Miranda in a much better light. Instead of Miranda seeming so black and white, Meryl Streep makes her complicated. I like chick-lit, and I like fashion, but Lauren Weisberger has written a book that incorporates both, but she seems to hate them as well."
3,review taken from One Book At A Time [...],"I have to admit that if I had read this before I had seen the movie I probably would have liked it a lot more. The book doesn't seem as outrageous once you've seen it. Miranda doesn't come to life as much in the book and Andrea doesn't have the same qualities on paper. That being said, I did enjoy reading the differences. There is some added substance to the book that they had to cut out of the movie for whatever reason. Although after awhile the book started to feel repetitive. I almost felt like Andrea in thinking what ungodly thing would Miranda ask for next because even I knew it was coming. I knew the inevitable conclusion, but I founds myself hoping the book would get there sooner. I would recommend it to those who haven't already seen the movie."
4,Way better than the movie,One aspect of this book that is undermentioned is the impact of having a hellish boss. I read this book when I was in that situation and it helped me have some laughs along the way. Other than that it is a little fantasy land to drift off to on a vacation. The relationship between Andrea and her best friend is truly examined in the book - a major piece that was likely left out of the movie due to timing.
2,So-so,"I found this book very disjointed and trivial.Obviously, I am not someone mesmerised by the fashion world and cannot understand the fascination.It passed the time on a cold, wet afternoon, but I wouldn't recommend it for a stimulating read."
2,Fine until the end,"I worked at a Barnes and Noble and this book was on the bestsellers list for some time, so I purchased it and boy, was I disappointed. The ""coming of working age"" and ""empowerment"" story was well written, and the story was intriguing and amusing until the climax. I felt less empowered and more disgusted. What I disliked about this book was not the writing, for it was not of poor quality, but the climax was, in my opinion, horribly stupid."
4,"Wonderfully, fun book","If you like the Shopaholic series, then you'll just love this book! After reading a few reviews, I wasn't sure that I still wanted to read it but I'm very happy that I did.Andrea Sachs gets a job (a job that a million girls would kill for) working as Miranda Priestly's junior assistant. Miranda is the head honcho at Runway magazine and when she says jump, you don't even ask ""how high"", you just do it. Andrea soon realizes that her so called job isn't all what it's cracked up to be. She has to take care of Miranda's laundry, her meals, which by the way must be hot and placed in a specific way and so many more meaningless tasks. If you've ever had a boss that you absolutely hated, reading this book will probably make your boss seem like an angel. Strange thing though, I just don't ever recall Miranda wearing Prada as the title refers."
4,For the Fashionista in all of us,"If you love Fashion and NYC you will really enjoy this book! The title gets you...The characters are kinda flat, and a little underdeveloped but the book on a whole is very funny and interesting if you are into fashion etc... Pick it up you will enjoy it espically if you have read the Shopaholic Series it is similar. I didn't like the ending however it was underdeveloped I thought it should have had a better twist it just kinda hung there!"
3,"From One Who has Worked at ""Runway""","Although the book was not very well written (and she did seem to complain an awfully lot) it was interesting to me as a reader, having worked there in the late 60's, early 70's (the days of Diana Vreeland) for gasp!......the advertising/merchandising department as an assistant. It was a hoot to find that I was an outcast according to An-dre-a. It was more of a life defining moment for me. Oh, there were horror stories, such as, higher-up editors demanding that their assistants come clean their closets on the weekends! But many of the editors were very good, creative, well adjusted people as I recall!"
3,Former Vogue employee speaks out,"As a former Vogue employee for a short time (until I could take it no longer) who remained at Condé Nast, I can say first-hand that The Devil Wears Prada is an accurate description of what goes on inside that building in Times Square. However, I found the writing poor and the book just a repetitive checklist of couture designers and name-dropping of NYC hotspots. If you live in NYC and work in publishing, take this book with you for a quick beach or plane read and enjoy saying to yourself, ""Oh that must be (insert name of Vogue employee)."" If you live or work outside of the NYC area, don't waste your time.I expected a much more in-depth look at the fashion publishing world, but turns out that my own personal experiences in the industry are significantly more interesting. Perhaps I have a future publishing and movie contract in my career, too."
4,Slightly shallow but entertaining.,Developed and interesting characters. I love that the character though young have experience alot.
2,Poorly written.,I am only several chapters into the book but so far it's poorly written. I didn't find it witty at all. Too bad since a story like this could have been written in a much more entertaining way. I don't like the main character at all. She just seems so whinny and not very smart either.Not sure if I will finish the book.
2,A fun book to read while sitting on the beach.,"Well, this isn't going to make literary history. It's a very, very fast ""beach"" read. Nothing heavy, nothing deep, just the story of an insipid personal assistant to a high powered fashion magazine editor. Once the pattern of verbal abuse, rudeness, and outrageous requests are established by Miranda Priestly (i.e. the ""Devil"") it goes on, and on, and on for chapter after chapter. I started to get fed up with the assistants constantly 'taking it' from the boss Miranda and couldn't wait for her to take action."
3,"Kept me interested, but...","The book kept me interested through out the whole thing, which has to mean something because if I dont like a book, I wont read it. I liked reading about the high end designer items, but my only problem with the book is that it really doesnt go anywhere. It just talks about her horrible boss and the stupid things she makes her do. There really isnt a big plot or climax. I was hoping for more in the end, and the book description, on the book flap anyway, doesnt even describe the book the way it happens. It makes it sound as if Andreah is going to nearly die - which she doesnt. Sorry to spoil it for everyone. I was hoping for more out of the characters; Andreas boyfriend, etc. but it just wasnt there. If you like designer items like I do, it will keep you interested, but dont read it if you can find something better. Please dont buy this book - check it out at your local library."
3,"Better than the Nanny Diaries, but still not fabulous","I often heard this book and The Nanny Diaries talked about together. After reading them both, this one is much better than the Nanny Diaries. It combines snappier dialogue and a better main character. As many women would love to be able to get an eye into the fashion world, this book takes you there as if you were on the bottom of the ladder. Whether it's accurate or not is not really even an issue, it's just a fun light read."
2,The Devil Wears Prada Review,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" was better than I expected it to be. To me, it's not supposed to be a book that makes you think. It's not an intellectual novel. It's an easy, fun, quick beach read. Put simply: A book you can read in a day. Weisberger is not an excellent, sophisticated writer, but she's good enough to create a story that's both funny and interesting. I will say this, I wasn't bored. I agree that it is similar to ""The Nanny Diaries,"" however; they were two very different books (different subjects), but yes, they border on being alike in that they both have insane, over-the-top bosses. My two cents: If you've got time, (or if you're going to the beach), buy it and read it, but if you don't, I wouldn't recommend it. Weisberger is no Carol Goodman (""The Lake of Dead Languages"" -a MUST read) or Donna Tart (""The Secret History"" - another excellent book). She could have published a better novel, after all, she DID graduate from Cornell. Tsk, tsk."
3,Pleasant Read but with Little Insight,"I wanted to see what the hype was about and although this was a light and easy read, I also didn't find anything particularly interesting or original in the work.A much better read, highly recommended if you liked Devil Wears Prada and love Paris:Paris in a Semester"
4,Entertaining Read,"This was a great book. I really liked this book, even though I have seen the movie already. The book has a lot more detail, and shows Miranda in an even more dramatic and demanding light. So, what I'm saying is, don't think that seeing the movie will ruin you for this book. It's well written...and you can literally see Andy transform by 180 degrees during her stint at Runway."
4,"Great ""relaxing"" read!","This was a fun book! I saw some reviews where they were saying ""how could this happen"", but who cares! I read it on the train to and from work every day after long days. It was fun and funny. I could relate some of the things going on to people around me and it just made me laugh. It is a great summer read or a read when you just want to turn off your day and relax with something ""mindless"". Mindless isn't ""silly or dumb"", just where you can turn your head off from everyday life and think a story is funny. Good read!"
3,Didn't like the ending,I was dissapointed of how the book ends. I would have expected Andrea's telling off Miranda to be more descriptive and intense. After all the stress and how much one gets to hate her boss....Andrea should have at least kill her. It is an entertaining but very stressful story to read. I would never put up with 10 minutes of this ridiculous Miranda character.
4,"Good, but a best seller??","I thought this was a good first effort by Lauren Weisberger although it really is no different from any other chick book, so I don't really understand why this one made it to the NYT bestseller list and any other one didn't. She does say in the acknowledgements that the people she named promised to buy multiple copies of the book if she named them, so maybe that explains the phenomenon.If you like chick literature, then I would recommend reading this book. I see it has some negative reviews, but it really isn't all that bad, it just has alot of hype, whether deserved or not deserved, you be the judge."
1,An Amusing Fable,"The Devil Wears Prada is an amusing fable of the consequences of trading integrity for access to power. The author would have us believe that she was willing to trade one year of her life picking up kids, dogs, drycleaning, and coffee in exchange for a good recommendation for employment as a writer elsewhere."
4,Why all the bad reviews,"This book is hilarious. It had moments I could live without, but all in all I loved it. One of the reviewers ripped this book and praised Bridget Jones. I thought Bridget Jones was awful or maybe I just couldn't relate. The target market for this book seems to be (possibly) the post-college, present-""life after college kinda blows, what do you mean I don't get to run things"", pre-career that I love reader. (Ding, ding, ding). BJ was more later twenties, early to mid-thirties and still looking for prince good-hygiene (having given up on prince charming) market."
1,Totally Unreadable,This is the worst waste of ink in a long time. The boss is so maniacal that I couldn't believe the main character would stay working for her. It was too over the top. I got bored half way through and had to stop reading when I took a peek at the last chapter and knew there would be no great revengeful reward.Two thumbs down.
1,HEAVEN help me...,"I am going to try my best not to throw up all over this POOR excuse for a read! If this were the last book on earth that I had to read just to maintain my last bit of sanity and intelligence, I think I'd opt for eating rocks and scribbling jibberish in the dirt! Who the HELL cares about this tale of who's who, her bitch boss, and her NAGGING! Spoiled, shallow, dead end book! My god man, it's so boring I think I just forgot what it was all about!"
1,Enough Already!,"This book is only a hit because people want to see just how much of a rhymes-with-witch American Vogue editor Anna Wintour really is. Fine. We get the picture in the first chapter - she's kennel bait. The rest of the book is a whine and cheese party for the main character who is given a series of jobs to do, each more humiliating than the last. By the fifth chapter you just want to slap this girl until your hand is numb. I only made it halfway through the book before I gave up."
1,At only 30 I am too old for this kind of whining!,This book was a real disapointment. I'd put this book in the same category of The Nanny Diaries. A long boring whine about young women who expect to have it all and resent their older female bosses who expect them to actually (gasp) work for their salaries. Yes some of the work demands are outrageous but get over it. That's life. I didn't feel a bit sorry for Andrea throughout the book. Boo hoo her boss made her work late and she was late to a party. The boss went home late to her kids! If she hates it so much then quit and do the real work to get a job at the magazine of her dreams. Save yourself the aggravation and read a different book!
1,Pure poop.,What is the point of this book? Is it how can you cram the name of every overpriced designer label into a paragraph? Where is the plot? Who cares if this girl had a bad job? Big deal she told her boss off... Skip this book.
3,Entertaining read,"As one of the editorial reviews said, it's somewhat like its predecessor, The Nanny Diaries, but not nearly as well written, nor as engrossing. I thought it was a decent book and entertaining. I have no interest at all in fashion (despite being a woman) but found the insider's look at the fashion world interesting. The author is drawing on her experience as an assistant to Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, and the book does give a real feel for what it would be like to have that job. I found the ending somewhat contrived and unbelievable and am not sure I would agree with the author that the heroine should stick with her alcoholic, downward-spiraling best friend rather than stick with her job."
1,"Tale told by an idiot, signifying nothing.","Without a doubt, the worst book I've ever read -- and one of the few I couldn't make myself finish. She's a poor writer with a weak story -- and didn't find a decent editor to get her out of the mess. It rambles, contradicts itself, the characters don't stay in character . . . . The main character, Andrea, is vapid, which makes her story a bore. Some people say that it makes good ""beach reading,"" but this book doesn't come close to that kind of achievement. A cute title and a hint of scandal gave this book a buzz it didn't deserve on its own merits. Don't waste your time."
1,Very Disenchanted,"I bought this book after seeing the previews for the upcoming movie as it looked rather interesting. However, in reading the book, I became very disenchanted. I found the book disheartening as I read on about such a difficult person and superficial work environment the character lives in. So be ready for this. Laura's writing is wonderful however. Through her writing she develops the young women through her difficutl experiences in dealing with an eccentric and self centered superior as well as back stapping work colleagues. I realize this is fiction, I look to books to escape this atmosphere."
5,Meet Miranda Priestly. The Worst Boss on the Planet.,I recently bought a copy of this book at Costco's after I watched the trailer for the film and got highly interested.I truely loved this book. I simply could not put it down!Weisberger is an amazing author and I loved how she wrote the book. The story is very original and creative.Totally worth the read.
3,Interesting Title But Mediocre Content,"I picked up this book at a local library thinking that it would be a quick read. But I was sadly mistaken. Granted, the book did start out funny and entertaining, but I found that the main character's constant complaining was a bit redundant. There are some cute moments (Andy's encounters with Christian) but for the most part I found it difficult to actually get through a book that was only 300 or so pages. I have to give the author some credit though for writing a book so young and straight out of college. Maybe in the future her books will live up to their titles."
3,"Blah, but mildly entertaining...","This book was okay at best. I was waiting for a rise and fall of events or a definitive plot to come along, but when it all came down to it the book just told the story of a girl's life over the course of 1 year. I was looking for more humor and maybe a little more excitment. In fact the only part that caught my attention was the end. If you're looking for a book like this with a similar plot that'll make you laugh and sympathize and keep you on your toes, try 'The Nanny Diaries.'"
3,"It's no classic, but still fun","Entertaining to jump on this roller coaster with main character Andrea, but her non-stop bitching and lack of a backbone makes it hard to empathize too much with her character. Predicted the ending from a mile away, which was a major letdown. Thought the characters of Lily as drunken hippie, Christian as smug writer, and Alex and do-gooder were too shallowly portrayed.Fun while it lasted, but feeling empty after the experience. Kind of like reading Cosmo these days."
3,The Devil Made Me Do It,"I fell under the spell of the magnificent marketing campaign and the catchy title and I bought the book. I eagerly anticipated lying poolside on a loungechair, diving in to the sunny summer reading fare. Unfortunately I took a bit of a bellyflop. Like the best laid summer plans, the book started out with such promise and then went nowhere at all. Young assistant has mean old boss. Got it. Now what? Characters are introduced and then left undeveloped. Situations are created and then left unresolved. Are we perhaps being groomed for a sequel? If so, lets hope that author Weisberger further develops her raw talent and we are given a new Devil's tale with more fire- that would be heavenly."
3,Light 'N Frothy Fun,"I checked DWP out from our public library the day before I went into the hospital for surgery because it appeared to be the perfect bit of light reading. Knowing that I couldn't handle a difficult read while under the influence of pain medication, I dug in and found it to be just what I was looking for. Look forward to reading about fashion, a more than demanding boss, and her naive new employee who just can't understand why her employer is such a [witch.] The close of this book is predictable and I flowed through this novel in a couple of days while dozing off between chapters. Enjoyable, but not serious, so take it for what it is."
1,Fashion Insider?,"Supposedly written by an author with an insider's view of the fashion world, but when a book contains such gems as the description of a model's look as ""heroine-chic"", even us non-fashionistas gotta cringe."
1,tedious and whiny,"I am about halfway through the book now and doubt I'll even be able to finish it. It details Andy, the narrator, working as an assistant to Miranda, editor of Runway Magazing (read: Vogue). I think she missed what her job title was in the interview - Assistant. You makes coffee runs, pick up the dry cleaning...The book is all about how awful Miranda is, but she is allowed to be - she paid her dues, unlike our herione who thinks she's entitled to the same amount of respect by virture of existing."
2,decent read but the author should examine her stereotypes,"I read through the book very quickly as it was interesting. I was mostly offended by the author's portrayal of the Indian characters in the book. Contrary to the author's belief, not all Indians are meek and nor do their homes smell like curry. As an Indian, I thought her comments were offensive and based on racial stereotypes. The writer should have gathered more accurate information before using stereotypes to thicken her book."
1,Grow Up Already,"I read this book, and while I myself have had demanding bosses,demeaning bosses crazy enough to tell you to write something and then claim they NEVER told you to write that, and you then had to show boss where they WROTE it down I would of never done what her character Andrea did.I would of been fired for insubordination just for the sighing and the delibrate back talk with her little ""Thank you"". To show her boss she was supposed to be better.Not all of us get Mommy and Daddy to pay for us to go to Ivy Leauge colleges and wake up and know just cause you work for some woman for a year will you get a job at the New Yorker, tell me do you write for them now?I think not."
2,Go away negative self-talk,"My biggest problem with this book is that the main character, Andrea, is constantly berating herself. It reminds me of the negative self-talk that drives young women to eating disorders and other self-esteem problems. I can't stand how critical women are of themselves, and I can't stand that this novel's heroine (!) is constantly engaging in this type of behavior."
4,enjoyable fashion read,"I first saw this book advertised in a magazine, and decided right then that I had to read it. I am a huge fan of chick-lit, and this sounded absolutely right up my alley. I picked it up as soon as it was available and could not put it down till I finished it. I really enjoyed this book a lot and cannot wait for the author to come out with another, hopefully similar. I got pretty into the characters and actually felt for them. Especially the main character, Andrea. I felt the same dislike towards her boss that she did. I kept wanting to scream at her to get out of that gosh awful position. Anyone who's had a boss from hell can relate, even if it was not in the fashion/magazine world. This book is a great summer read."
2,Entertaining,"I have to admit that I enjoyed the book to a certain extent. It was difficult to get too involved in it because the author maintains a surface level depth throughout the entire book. In other words, this is definitely not the most thought-provoking, earth-shattering book I have read in my life. Many of the characters were one dimensional and failed to evolve during the novel. I have to agree with another reader that the author failed to bring forth Andrea's true dedication. I was also sorely disappointed with the ending as I felt it was entirely cliche. If you want a novel that has twists and turns, this is not the novel for you."
2,Not For Me,"""THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA"" seems to be a love it or leave it book. Turned out to be not my cup of tea. I only got through about 1/3 before I cut my losses and donated it to the library book sale. A better choice would be ""TRADING UP."""
1,Who cares?,"When I read this book I couldn't even finish the book. The main character, Andy was an uninspired lead and a boring one at that. I found it very difficult to relate to someone who just seems to be handed everything on a silver platter...it truly felt that she didn't have to work for achieving her goals. Thus, it made the book boring and complete out of touch with reality. Of course, sometimes you have suspend belief in novels, but I really can't do that for a whole book. Honestly, if this were me, there would be no book, because I would have quit that job instead of just complaining about it all the time."
3,Some funny parts - Definitely no substance at all,This is light book but it can get quite boring at times. There are some funny parts but they're not many. It's just a very long list of the devilish antiques of Miranda Priestly. Other than that there is no storyline to speak of. Lacking in substance and plot.
1,So bad!!! Movie was better; I couldn't even finish this book!,"I'm just SO over this kind of stuff. Yes, I read Candace Bushnell's last book and yes, I have the entire series of Sex and the City and I have even read (and enjoyed) The Nanny Diaries. However...this was SO TIRED. I didn't care about Andrea, her boyfriend, her life journey...I did like the Miranda character and couldn't WAIT for the movie to come out to Meryl do it right.But that's just it...I was WAITING FOR THE MOVIE. And I loved the movie...but I don't need to spend time reading 100-150 pages about how hellish living in NYC with a devil-boss and getting sweet clothes on the side is....The movie was WAY better; and I don't say that very often."
2,What a waste of paper,"I have a word for the publishers out there. Just because a person likes fashion and ""Sex in the City"" doesn't mean they are illiterate. This book could have been a funny, entertaining look at the inside politics of a fashion magazine. Instead the book is a mishmash of fashion gossip without any story to kept it interesting. Did anyone...bother to edit this book?The idea behind the book seemed interesting enough-young woman gets job working for famous fashion editor-in-chief but where is the plot. There's some insider dish on the fashion industry but not enough to keep the reader interested. Miranda, the editor-in-chief, may be crazy but the assistant, Andrea, is a spoiled, whiny brat. Who am I suppose to like in this book? Andrea, I don't think so. Why should I care enough about anyone in this book to finish it? [...]"
1,Horrible - read the real thing,"It's hard to believe [she] could somehow publish a book on the subject. My advice, as someone who endured the seasonal presentations, is to read the professional publications and NOT this opportunistic...version of events. Give it up, baby."
1,Fun movie/Awful book,"I made it to page 99. When I read that a 6-year-old who brought a box-cutter to school was in the 4th grade, that was it. That fact was soooo wrong, I couldn't stomach any more. I didn't like the ""heroine."" The descriptions of the clothes and decor were more like name-dropping than narrative. Maybe that's what readers who liked this book wanted, but there's so much better fluff-reading in the world. (Like Janet Evanovich). And any person in the world who is as obnoxious as the Miranda Priestly character needs to be shunned. I liked the movie, but it was very good casting that made it work, especially the impeccable Meryl Streep who managed to create a Miranda that wasn't a cartoon character. I found the book in a bargain bin and paid 40 cents for it; that was probably too much."
5,For people who have had an abusive boss,"Lauren Weisberger has done a great service for people who have had the misfortune to work for an abusive boss; the author describes all manner of humiliations that will resonate with many readers. It's done in a light-hearted tone, which makes for easy reading.As an alumnus of New York City investment banks and law firms, Miranda Priestly reminded me of many a boss who acted as if they were curing cancer when they were merely putting together lucrative deals.Miranda Priestly exists in many forms. Lauren Weisberger was able to write about an experience that leaves many people ashamed and scared silent."
1,The devil writes crap,"For someone who wanted to write for New York, ending up with such a novel it is not a good sign. I mean, I bet the devil is a happier person for wearing prada than if he read this awful novel. Sorry, but ...that's the ugly truth."
1,Waste of time,"This book is not even worth the time it took to read the cover with. There is no point to it and nothing of interest to it either. It is not light, funny, emotional or even ""dishy""(whatever that is). The book is boring! BORING!"
2,I want my nanny back!,"I was very excited to read this book. I even broke my own rule of book purchasing and bought it new and in hardcover. Whoa, was I disappointed! I expected a lot more Sex and the City and a lot less Nanny Diaries. It was virtually the same book--just different girls in different jobs. The main difference is that The Nanny Diaries is better written.Like many of the other reviewers, the main character didn't move me at all. I wasn't sympathetic to her plight, and her reason for staying in this job just wasn't all that realistic. Many of the other characters had potential, but they just weren't all that developed. I would have liked to have seen more of the ""twins"" and of Emily. I would have liked to know more about Alex; however, we are only given one tyrannical phone call after another.Check this out from the library or borrow your friend's copy. But save your money for something different!"
1,should be zero stars,I bought it because of the hype. I read it because I bought it. I returned it becuase I'm not a fool.
3,The Devil Swears ...by Caricatures,"Imagine you are sitting having a bitchfest with four of your best girlfriends, surrounded by coffee and beer and yesterday's magazines in a slobby apartment. Now open this book, dump the coffee and the friends and the magazines...cos the novel is your personal frontside view to a complete bitchfest - of course ...peppered with outrageous caricatures, a goody two shoes heroine, and a lame ending, well...ok...clobbered ending.Andrea is the personal assistant to Miranda Priestly who is the high priestess of a leading fashion mag. She rules her terrain with a maniacal tyrannical hand and Andrea rues the day she took on ther job. Ho Hmmm..."
3,Boring,"I had heard so much about this book, I was prepared to like it before I read it. I was disappointed. It is a ""The Nanny Diaries"" clone. I cared more for the main character in the ""Nanny Diaries"" than I did in this book. All she does is gripe about her boss and complain about how overworked she is. What little humor you see is forced and not funny. I am amazed that I finished it.One complaint I have about both books is their format. They are physically difficult to read.Jorge's review hit the nail on the head. Read it."
2,Unrelatable,"I might have enjoyed this when I was a teenager or in my very early 20's but even just a little bit older and wiser and I found I couldn't relate to the main character at all. She spends the whole time working for this devil, meeting her every whim, complaining about how awful it is, and never does anything to change her situation! After about 1/3 of the book, I mostly just read it to see if the story would change, which it didn't. I can't really recommend it."
2,Semi entertaining fluff.....but,"The book is the equivalent of some of those silly women's magazines that you read at your salon. Fluffy and harmless and fine to pass the time with. I just had to vent however about some of the sloppy writing and a few inaccuracies. Anyone who has ever picked up a fashion magazine knows that Bobbi Brown is spelled with an i not a y (the writer shouldn't use names that she can't spell properly), and six year olds aren't in fourth grade (anyone who has ever been 6 years old knows this one) oh and ""Giselle"" isn't really short, she's 5'11. I'm all for people being able to make a buck off of anything that isn't immoral or illegal but it irks me that this writer made quite a bit of money for such a lazy effort."
2,The shoes don't fit,Reading this book is like wearing a pair of Manolo's that don't fit. They cost a lot of money and look good but at the end of the day they hurt. A cute book but not worth the time to read the entire thing. Wait for the Cliff Notes.
2,ZZZzzzzzzzzzz!,"Repetitive. Boring. Gets slightly interesting near the end, but then doesn't tie up the loose ends of Andy's love-life. What happens with Alex...or Christian? Hellooooo? The one interesting storyline just buggers off and dies!!! I've worked for a boss like Miranda, and I still found it painstaking to read the same scenarios OVER AND OVER again...."
2,"Somewhat entertaining, but predictable","I read about this book after I finished ""The Nanny Diaries"" and thought it sounded interesting and funny. However, I got a little bored with the whiny narrator and the predictable plot line. Basically, the whole book is about a spoiled Brown graduate who ends up working for a nasty boss. We've all been there and survived to tell about it, so what's so special about Andrea Sachs and her struggle to succeed in the real world?"
3,IT WAS GOOD BUT NOT WORTH THE HYPE,This book was okay but not what it was hyped up to be. Don't get me wrong it was good but not great. I liked it and enjoyed reading it but some parts were a little boring that's why I think that it was worth 3 to 3.5 stars. I loved the movie a lot.
3,Nice and easy reading,"I actually liked this book very much. It may be over the top every now and then, and the writing is definitely unimpressive, but it did provide a few hours of enjoyable leisure time. Read it to rest your brain and have a good time."
2,Good book if you're not expecting much,"I found it to be an easy, mindless read. There were some funny parts. It was easy to find compassion for Andy, the main character, but after awhile, I found myself getting frustrated with her. I suppose being young,impressionable and thrown into this world was overwhelming. I can see how young women would relate to her, as I found her character to be realistic.Overall, I felt the book was a bit slow and repetitive, and parts read like an ad for high-end merchandise. It lacked depth. I kept reading, waiting to see what happens next, but in the end, was left still waiting. The ""big climax"" I was waiting for was disappointing.That being said, I didn't find it terrible. If you're looking for a quick, light-hearted read, and you don't expect any more than that, this is it."
3,well-detailed but cartoonish,"I bought this book to have something to talk about with my 12-yr-old fashionista, and made it to the end of the 400+ pages.It was an enjoyable read, perhaps because it reinforced my prejudices of New Yorkers as pushy, the fashion world as shallow, and jet-setters as glamorous, providing a blow-by-blow and brand by brand detailing.The plot, however, was unrealistic, particularly the ending. The characterizations were flat, and I was at a loss when asked which was my favorite character - none of them. Yet they had ample and honest flaws laid out - lying, alcoholism, cruising bars, overworking.So my opinion was decidedly mixed, and it benefited from being a very light read."
3,Nanny Diaries in the fashion world,"It was humorous and the characters interesting, but the theme is similar to the Nanny Diaries: young woman just out of college takes entry level position, not really in her field, in order to break into her field. Young woman is employed by outrageously insensitive woman who makes her life miserable, until she is fired. She learns a life lesson but ends up happy."
3,Like the ending that never ended.,"As a person interested in the in's and out's of the fashion world I was terribly disappointed in the good start,and terrible ending of this book. The beginning was awesome since this girl lands the job that a million girls would die for, what an awesome opportunity. But, throughout the book there is not one inspiring thing that teaches her, (An-dre-ah!!) how good of an opportunity this really was for her to take! Then like I said the ending just makes it more confusing since the author really does not extend on what happens next. Is there going to be a second part to this book? I sure would like to read one that way I don't keep thinking of what happened next."
4,I loved it...,"I honestly loved this book! I thought that it was cute, witty, stylish & probably described in accurate details of how some of the rich and famous ""may"" treat their personal assistants."
4,Great easy summer read,"I'd recommend this book to someone who enjoys the show on HBO ""sex and the city"". This is a book that'll take you only a few days to read, it won't challenge your mind, but it'll make you laugh and make you want to be this girl. This book is basically a chick flick - but I'd really recommend reading it."
2,Delicious Trash,"While it's an entertaining and utterly mindless ""beach read"", Ms. Weisberger obviously has written an exhaustive autobiography of her fist post-college year. Having myself worked for a horribly demanding and selfish female CEO for many years, it was easy to identify with her frustration, degradation and lack of self-dignity and re-live the first years of my career. The only real humor regarding this book has been watching the fashion industry's reactions to the ""INSIDE STORY OF THE REAL ANNA WINTOUR"" which unfortunately is all this book amounts to be."
1,Zzzzzzz,"This is one book of probably three in my life that I simply could not finish. It could not hold my interest, and I was not drawn to any of the characters enough to get past the 3/4 point. You know how you and your girlfriends go through your early 20's focused narrowly on yourselves? For outsiders, it's torture to listen to the endless prattle. This reminded me of that phase. We get waaaaay too much detail about the lead characters banal, everyday movements and thoughts, which are compelling only to her. The more interesting book would provide, of course, the fly-on-the-wall perspective on the editor-in-chief's life. As it stands in this book, we only get tiny histrionic bits and glimpses of the most potentially interesting character. It's all just too dull."
2,dialogue is like cardboard,"only buy this book if you want an inside peak at the fashion business, the dialogue is unrealistic and wooden at best. the editor is shallow and vain. hello? this is the fashion world we're talking about - it shouldn't be a shock!"
4,inside a mad mad world,"Having worked IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY , it was easy to relate to this work and be awkardly reminded of some of my own actions while I was a 'player' in the business. Reading this and seeing the lifestyle fromt he outside confirmed the absurditiy of it all. Would be interesting to know of Anna ever read this book --I bet she did and hated every moment of it--Would she ever change--No way!!--Thats what kleeps her on top."
5,A laugh a minute!,"After hearing so many people talk about this book, I had to see what all the fuss was about. I loved this debut novel! If you need a fun read for fun's sake every now and then, you will love this book. Don't get caught up in the criticisms of Weisberger's grammatical errors...just enjoy this book for what it is...entertainment! If you are not into reading fashion magazines, cannot name a fashion couture designer, or do not follow fashion trends, I would not recommend this book. Andrea's bored attitude and loathing of the fashion industry as well as her snide remarks about Miranda and her co-workers are a riot. Being privy to her thoughts was hilarious! I laughed out loud when Andrea told Miranda off at the end! I am looking forward to Weisberger's next novel."
1,Don't bother...,"This book is not only unoriginal (similar books include the Nanny Diaries, which was somewhat better) but very whiny. Despite her attempts, the author fails to convey any humour or gain pity for the protagonist... The Devil Wears Prada made me cringe; the ""protagonist""(if she may be called that, as it is well-known that the author lived similar experiences) seems spoiled and unprepared to hold down a job. Basically, it reads like a spiteful dish-all about the author's boss (Vogue editor Anna Wintour). My advice: don't waste your time and money on this book."
1,Boring....,"I expected more from this book because of the publicity - Lauren Weisberger even got on the Today show with Matt Laurer. My advice, spend your money on a subscription to Vogue instead."
2,"""Nuclear"" Wintour Revealed","This poorly written book exists only to reveal a glimpse of the miserable excuse for a human being -- and a highly regarded one at that -- who edits a leading women's fashion magazine. Is Anna Wintour of Vogue as beastly as the protagonist's boss Miranda Priestley depicted in this book? That's for the reader to judge. Whatever degradation author Lauren Weisberger suffered at the hands of the real Miranda, however, she got a two-book deal from her publisher, which is about one book more than her talents as a writer merit."
2,I really wanted to like it!,"I saw previews for the movie of the same name recently in the theaters, and since I like to read the books first, I picked this book up. I do plan on seeing the movie and sincerely hope that it's better than the book. The main character, Andrea Sachs, lacks depth and isvery one dimensional - certainly not someone that you could care about. Miranda is almost too much bitchiness rolled into one individual. I guess my biggest disappointment in the book was that I kept waiting for the 'big confrontation' that seemed inevitable - where Andrea could finally tell Miranda what she thinks of her and her job and it just doesn't happen. The ending was a huge disappointment for me. I just felt that the ending was lacking the sparks that it needed."
1,Quit WHINING already!,"Against all odds, a woman lands a prestigious job with a top fashion magazine.Then whines about it for the whole book.The job assignments are ridiculous for any job: A glamourized, over-worked go-fer who is expected to read the mind of her boss. An assistant for an editor who apparently does no writing. And somehow a year in this job is supposed to land her a writer's dream job at the New Yorker (you guessed it... it does.)This book offers no insight, no entertainment, nothing. It did not make me laugh. I did not like the heroine... or any of the characters. The 'plot' was inane. I cannot think of one redeeming quality of this book.Skip it."
3,"For the genre and first attempt, it's pretty fascinating","Not having a background in fashion, I still adored this book because it reminded me of my first experiences working in Washington. While my boss was no Miranda Priestly, he could be just as irrational and extremely demanding. The strange world of the rich and powerful was just as foreign to me as it was to Andrea Sachs. There are some faults and lack of character development, as is mentioned in other review, i.e. Lily and the make-up and I don't really get the reason for the Christian character, but I still read it in less than a week, because I wanted to know how it turned out... It didn't make me laugh-out-loud on the train like the Shop-a-holic series, but it was pretty good."
3,Maybe another half star,"I wasn't overly impressed by the beginning of ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" but a third of the way through the novel, the writing and momentum picked up and there were flashes of brilliance in some extremely well described scenes. (I found the song-dance routines Andrea had to go through with Eduardo hilarious.) The ending was anti-climatic. Surely a bright girl (Andrea) who knew the inner workings of Miranda Priestly's life could have come up with a more clever and classy way of terminating her relationship with her boss. The ending, like the beginning, was written in that annoying pseudo-sophisticated style found in many women's magazines."
3,A little uneven...,"... and the sub-plots are somewhat cookie-cutter - but if you've ever had the World's Worst Job, working for the World's Most Obnoxious Boss - and strived valiantly to keep it because you're sure that at some point, some time, some way, it will all pay off... you'll be able to relate and get a few good giggles. I know I once worked for that boss, that company... just without the glamourous industry, without the fabulous perks, and for $10,000 a year less.I agree that the main character, Andrea, doesn't do a lot to generate sympathy for herself - but come on... she's fresh out of college, and anyone who's ever managed entry-level staff knows that dozens of personal phone calls and too-long coffee breaks are often par for the course.All in all, it was a fun read - not literary, not deep, not profound - but fun... and makes me wonder if I could have stayed a little longer at my truly wretched previous job if I'd at least gotten free Jimmy Choo's out of the deal..."
1,How did this book make the best seller list?,"This book is about a spoiled young woman with poor communication and decision-making skills who constantly complains about her insensitive employer's poor communication skills. There are some episodes where the writer builds some interesting conflict, but then the chapter ends and in the next chapter the essence of the conflict is long forgotten without any satisfying explanation of how it got resolved.Being a fashion-follower for decades, I was hungry for an inside look at the fashionistas. What a disappointment! I eagerly read the first few chapters. Half-way through I became dismayed, and then only skimmed the last half, uselessly hoping to find something worthy of my attention.If you have only enough money to buy one book, do not waste it on this vacuous story."
1,Blech.,"I enjoy a fun, mindless novel as much as the next chick (Good In Bed, Nanny Diaries, etc.) but this book was just plain awful. I found myself skipping ahead to see if anything interesting was going to happen but it just moved from one preposterous plot point to another with zero style or wit. The main character is such an annoying little brat that you start rooting for the ""devil"" (her boss). And one more thing: the spelling and grammar errors are just unforgivable. Wouldn't someone who is such an insider know how to spell supermodel Gisele's name? Or at least spell it one way consistently? I'll say it again: blech. If you still want to read it, I'm listing mine immediately on half.com."
3,Entertaining,This is a very light book. One cannot help but feel sympathy for Andrea. Many of us cannot help seeing glimpses of our own bosses in Miranda! This is like watching something on Cinematherapy; not very superior literature but at the same time pretty entertaining.
3,"Fun read, but...","I enjoyed this novel like I enjoy reading an US magazine while standing in line at the supermarket. I know it's not really good for me, and not making me a better person, but I have to look at it.The book, while redundant and choppy, was still entertaining. I really felt myself picking up speed towards the end - you just know from the very beginning that something HUGE will happen between Andrea and her boss. So the book is almost impossible to put down. I doubt it will be on any academic reading lists, but it was sure fun for a summer read. Good luck to her with her next book."
1,A Disappointment,"I can't understand the hype around this book, nor can I really understand how it ever got published. The writing is simple and uninteresting, the plot is almost nil, and it's completely self-indulgent. I had much more sympathy for the mean boss Miranda Priestly. At least she was competent. There is no depth, no major style - the author uses big names to impress the reader rather than detailed, well-written descriptions of the clothes, parties, etc... A waste of money. I skimmed the last 50 pages to the predictable ending just so that I wouldn't feel like I threw $20 in the garbage."
1,The Nanny Diaries Called... Devil Wears Prada STOLE my Plot,"I looked forward to reading this book. All of the hype made it sound like a fun summer read. THE BOOK WAS TERRIBLE!! The main character was contrived and all too stereotypical do-gooder.IT BORED ME TO DEATH!! If you liked the Nanny Diaries, you will hate this book!! It is the same plot only in the world of fashion instead of the world of an Upper East Side Mom.Worst money I EVER SPENT!!HORRIBLE BOOK!!!"
1,one of the worst books i've ever read!!,"This book was one of the worst books I've ever read. I thought it would be a fun read, full of insider gossip about Vogue, but Andrea, the narrator, was one of the most unsympathetic characters in recent fiction. Andrea is pretentious and spoiled and I thought if she mentioned the New Yorker one more time I would slip into a coma. She complains about all the thin women at the magazine, but tells us over and over again how she is 5'10"" and weighs 115 pound. I didn't feel sorry for Andrea, who is at the beck and call of an evil Anna Wintour-esque character. and horror of horrors, forced to get fattening food for her -- in fact, by the end I was skimming the book and was rooting for the boss. The Devil wears Prada is boring, self-indulgent and badly written. Save your $$$ and read something else."
1,Pure unadulterated garbage,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this...! My third-grade cousin is far more skilled at plot development than Weisberger will ever be....if you're really in the mood for an expose, just reread Nanny Diaries - trust me, it will be far more satisfying."
1,Was I supposed to HATE the narrator?,"I think we were supposed to hate the boss but frankly, the whinny, self-pitying narrator got most of my wrath. So she works for a hard boss, a lot of us do and with a lot less perks than this chick got...plus, she knew it was only for a year - big deal! Did she think that she didn't have to pay dues like the rest of the world? I work in the entertainment world and have worked for people like this and know that it's a means to an end - I didn't take it out on coworkers, friends and my work...and I didn't really enjoy reading about someone who does. My advice - don't waste your time."
4,FUN AND ENTERTAINING,"Found the book interesting, fun and entertaining and that was good enough for me. Good view of the fashion/mag industry. Could relate to the lack of confidence displayed by the heroine as she was very young. You could read worse."
1,Too cute,"I do not recommend this novel, although it is interesting to skim the name-dropping about real people; the details about those real people are probably accurate, as they would not be protected by violation of privacy. Nonetheless, the novel seems mean-spirited. While the ""Devil,"" allegedly based in part on the author's former real-life boss Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, is a fascinating creature of arrogance and greed--and meaner than hell, maybe similarly to how some have described other ""famous women"" in real life--there isn't any depth to the novel. According to an interview with the author that I read on-line, Ms. Weisberger knows ""this isn't War and Peace,"" and has been surprised at all the ""buzz"" and about being called the new ""it"" writer. I don't think so. Cleverness and cuteness don't make for strong writing, no matter how many names one is able to drop."
2,b-o-r-i-n-g,"This book presents itself as a quick, stylish read. It's not. It contains many structural errors. The reader is expected to embrace one-dimensional characters. It plods along- same-old, same-old, to its weak, predictable ending. This story could have been written by a high school junior."
3,FUN BUT EXTREMELY EXAGERRATED,"I just got out of college and worked one year for a company which I thought treated its employees in the most servile way possible. Fortunately, I moved on for better things in life but the experience is unforgettable. 'The Devil Wears Prada' is a fun read but things were a bit too farfetched and the writing extremely redundant. For such a lengthy book, some chapters could have been dedicated to make the book a little insightful than repeating the atrocities of the boss over and over again."
3,"light, airy read for when you're not looking deep","A few points that this author should take note:- no need to go into excruciating detail about every single thing just to up your word count.- not everyone from the south is an inbred hick, and not all southerners talk like idiots.this book was OK. I'm reading it because the movie looked good, and I'm betting it's going to be one of the rare times the movie is better than the book... Of course, Weisberger gets her money either way. I probably would have stopped reading long ago if it weren't for the movie, though."
2,Spicy but poorly written,"So I'm not ashamed that I wanted to find out about life at Vogue: the good, but especially the bad (!). However, this book made me feel like weak and depressed. Either you think Lauren is great and side with her against the monstrous AW, or you think Lauren can't write very well and probably deserved to be sent on meaningless errands. I fall into the latter category. There are some funny bits in the book but overall it was a little tiresome."
1,I can sum this book up in one sentence...,"""OMG MY BOSS SUCKS WAAAAAH!""There, now you dont need to waste your $ on it. Try Front Row instead."
5,Great inside view of unfettered power,"I thought this was a fascinating look at how someone who generates lots of revenue is permitted unfettered power over underlings. It sheds light on not only the inner workings of VOGUE, but I suspect Enron, etc. Miranda/Anna can do whatever she wants to anyone because of her ability to generate income for Conde-Nast and all those who depend on Vogue for sales. The ""rules"" of common decency don't apply to her, either by her own or anyone else's standards because everyone depends on her for money. (I am asuming the book pretty much accurately portrays the authors's experience working for Anna Wintaur at Vogue). More of these kinds of books should be written. Maybe it would serve the salutory effect of curbing the excesses of executives when neither they nor their employer does so."
3,"Fun, but poorly written","I was so excited to read this book, as I love this type of writing. However, the writing was amateurish. It felt like a silly editorial in creative writing class. And the side story of Lily - I practically skimmed this to get back to what was really interesting - Andrea's job and her interactions with Miranda and Emily. Her boyfriend was just as boring and pointless as Lily - the clothes were great, but the book sucked."
4,Entertaining!,"THE DEVI WEARS PRADA, by Lauren Weisberger, is an entertaining story. The characters are fun, the dialogue moves along nicely, and the plot interesting enough. I think most readers will appreciate this one as much as I did.John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures INC.Beverly Hills, California"
2,Lame book for lame females to read,"I ought to have known, when you read a book advert that has to tell you what brilliant university the brilliant new author graduated from, DON'T BUY THE BOOK! But do I listen to my inner voice? No. I bought the book, I read it, I am shocked that this ranks as a NY Times Bestseller - I have to believe that it's how far down our society has gone, that this book is hot reading. Do they only poll the shallow and self-absorbed? The book has a plot, which earns it two stars. It is fraught with loose ends, no resolution for some of the main characters, and a one dimensional heroine who'd like to believe she's two dimensional. This is the sort of book girlfriends ought to write to each other on emails and chit chat about, not something they actually killed trees to manufacture, and certainly nothing that ought to go so far as to call itself literature, despite whatever rich kid college the author's parents were able to afford. Go somewhere else, read something else."
2,Jane Austen...why did you have to die and leave us with this nonsense?,Besides...everyone knows that the Devil wears Vera Wang. A pedestrian effort by a great-looking author.
2,No Time For Tea,"""THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA"" seems to be a love it or leave it book. Turned out to be not my cup of tea. I only got through about 1/3 before I cut my losses and donated it to the library book sale. A better choice would be ""TRADING UP."""
5,More Than Meets The Eye: Bigger Than The Movie,"I think most reviewers missed the bigger picture of this book, which, unlike the movie, goes well beyond the specific topic of the fashion industry. Anyone who has ever had a nightmare supervisor, or has ever stayed with something for way too long without knowing why, will identify. One reviewer felt there was a lack of transition from disaster to disaster; maybe so, but that actually adds to the reality of a situation in which there is no logic: the boss from hell is always unpredictable and the reasons one stays in hell never make sense. I liked Andrea Sachs and empathized with the complete nonsense with which she chose to deal, over and over with no apparent way out. Besides that, the book was a good laugh. One a million authors for sure wish they had written! And because of the breadth of the book, I'm sorry, I know I am in the minority on this, but: its MUCH better than the movie!"
3,Perfect vacation read,"Don't look for haute art when you buy this book where haute couture takes center stage. This book is entertaining and funny, and a perfect read while lounging at the pool or on the beach or on a chaise in your back yard. It's funny and purely entertaining. When you need to give your brain a break and satisfy your need for glorified society gossip, this is a perfect choice. Oh yes, and one more warning: this is for girls only! Guys will be bored to death."
1,A disaster,"I saw a television show that raved about this book alongside the Dirty Girls Social Club. Shame on them and shame on me for paying more than a dollar for this over-hyped book. ""Andrea"" has so much contempt for her horrible mean boss, but the majority of the book she herself is criticizing and belittling everyone around her. I pray for the world's sake that the screenplay for the movie is more interesting than the book. It was 4 days of my life I'll never get back. By the 150th page you don't want to read anymore, but its like a train wreck and you just have to see it through. I am willing to send my copy free of charge to anyone who wants it. Just seeing it on my dresser gives me a headache."
4,"Great read, highly recommend it to pass some time","This book was entertaining with a great storyline. Most of us have had horrific bosses and the author portrays a humorous side of what it's like to work for them.I also saw the movie and enjoyed the book more, as I usually do when I watch movies about books I've read. The character development is much more in depth and entertaining."
1,I Can't Even Finish It,"I'm the type of person when i start a book i finish, well this is one book i can't finish. It is just so boring, nothing exciting happens, its not as funny as i thought it would be. I think we get it by the first page Andy has a horrible boss, did you need to write a book saying pretty much the say thing through out the whole freaking book. It was horrible, it was a waste of a good 5 bucks. I'm not to happy."
1,Where's the plot?,"I read this book (yes, the WHOLE THING), just hoping to get to the plot. Even in the end, none of the shallow characters became triumphant or victorious in any of the struggles they experienced during the whole story. Sorry if I ""spoiled"" it for you...The book had a great beginning, but telling the whole story proved to be the author's weak point.Skip this one..."
1,whats all the hype??,"I read this book a few years ago. It was horrible. The characters uninteresting, the plot boring and the writing unbelievably terrible at best. When I heard that it was a movie with Meryl Streep, I thought that maybe they changed something and made the movie great. But it was just as terrible as the book. Don't waste your time or money, find something else!"
3,Schadenfreude,"The pleasure in reading The Devil Wears Prada derives largely from the sure knowledge that we ourselves have never behaved so despicably as Miranda Priestly. This book gives the average shlub unparalleled opportunities to look down on the svelte queens of fashion from moral high ground. From that standpoint, and for an inside look at the fashion magazine workplace, it's loads of fun. It's a lightweight read with a quick pace."
5,The #1 Chick Lit Book of All Time,"It absolutely is! It has quite a dramatic, almost painful humor. Quite simply, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is an extremely well-written parody of bosses-from-hell with perfect comedic timing. I'd say even the ending was pretty good on this one.I rarely read books twice, but I did read this one twice and enjoyed it just as much the second time around if not more.Even if you're not a big chick lit fan, you may enjoy this book (and it may turn you into a fan of this genre)."
3,Mildly Entertaining Beach Book,"Although I swore I would never pick up another ""average girl trying to find/marry Mr Right while balancing her career and dealing with quirky friends"" book, I read this one. At first I found it entertaining - an inside look at the ultra chic, fashionista world - the self-absorbed, demanding boss, etc. More than halfway through, however, I was sick of the heroine's ""poor me"" simpering and only kept reading to see if she would devlop a backbone (but by the end, I really didn't care anymore). Overall its a mildly entertaining beach-type book."
3,"Devil Wears Prada, even the title seems dated","Ms. Weisberger has written a fantastic read assailing her former boss, Anna Wintour of Vogue, sometimes known as Nuclear Wintour. Or did she? The HarperCollins lawyers obviously take this as a work of fiction but no one else would. Why else call Wintour by name for no reason near the end of the book except to prove the point badly that she isn't Miranda? but is Nigel Andre Leon Talley? Again, who else could it be? Thanks for letting us in Vogue and conde Nast, even if you do call them Runway and Elias-Clark. No one else throws away money like that for nothing."
4,"Great Title, Great Book","I adore this book. Part of me didn't want to - but the more I read, the more I found myself thoroughly enjoying it. We've all had a Miranda Priestly in our life at some point, and I often found myself relating to Andrea in the novel. It was highly enjoyable and I would definitely recommend it. Be forewarned - if you are not a fashionista or are not up on fashion, you will not enjoy this book. There are many ""insider"" type fashion references that one without a thorough knowledge of fashion and the industry would not appreciate or understand."
4,Couldn't Put It Down,"I thought this book was fascinating. I could not put it down. To be privvy to a life that most of us can't even imagine was fun and voyeristic. I highly recommend it as a quick, fun read. The only unanswered question I had was what happened to Christian and was that story based on someone real?"
1,Terrible book,"What a waste of time this was to read, a story of greed, waste and an abusive boss, greed and waste. I would have quit at page 20 except that it was a book group pick so I stuck with it. It was a really horrible story of female on female emotional abuse and emotional violence.My entire book group hated it."
4,The Boss-From-Hell,"Andrea gets a dream job at a fashion magazine, but gets the boss-from-hell. Actually her dream involved writing for the New Yorker but fetching coffee and dry cleaning for the boss seems unlikely to train her for that. She plugs away as the job becomes all consuming and the demands from her boss grate more and more on her nerves.As her relationships dwindle under the stress of the job, the conflict with the boss becomes more personalized. Andrea becomes more and more paranoid as sleep deprivation and lack of social support turn her into a whining, unpleasant person herself.Fascinating insider view of the fashion industry and working in the high-pressure NYC jobs. Often funny, a bit romantic and eventually somewhat depressing as Andrea is dragged further and further down by the job and the horror that is her boss."
4,Great Beach Read! Will Make You Desire More Like It!,"I couldn't get enough of the NY & high fashion featured in this book. The story wraps up well, but leaves a little to be desired. Although it is great for a fun, quick, laugh out loud read. I hope for a sequel or anticipate another insider look at a women's working world from Weisberger."
5,Love it!,"One of my favorite chick books! It was entertaining, fast-paced, addictive- and I love Weisberger's take on her character's- she gets to the innocence and vulnerability of Andrea, as well as the nastiness and equally vulnerable Miranda. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book!"
2,Devil Wears Prada - see the movie,"This is one of those rare cases where I have to say I think the movie was better than the book. Maybe my views were tainted because I saw the movie first, but I thought the consolidation of the story necessary to cram it into a two-hour movie actually made it stronger. Not to mention that fashion guru Miranda Priestly's character was so convincingly crafted in the book that reading about her horrid demands actually gave me a headache - a testament to the characterization but still not all that much fun.However, I'll be the first to say I have no real basis for reviewing this one because I am not a connoisseur of chick lit - my experience with the genre is limited to The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing and Bridget Jones's Diary (both of which, incidentally, I loved). So by all means, don't take my word for it."
4,Entertaining Book with a Flipside.,"I just finished reading ""The Devil Wears Prada"" this morning. The book was light, fun and entertaining. On a different note, the book also lets the reader realize how superficiality plays a large role in today's world even beyond the catwalk. And with that obsession, shows how some folks would even compromise their own beliefs/values, neglect their personal lives and allow outsiders to belittle them to eventually have that ever-so-deserved job that ""any girl or boy would die for"". Is it even worth it in the end? Check it out and see for yourself! My rating: 3.5/5 stars."
3,Not as good as the movie:),You know how the book is out and you have to see which is better the book or the film. Well the toss up is the movie is so much better the book is ok but not as good as the film.:)
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with The Devil Wears Prada. It was pretty boring. I think the selling point is that you get insider information about Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, and her many infamous piccadillos. That part was, in fact, interesting. But the storyline was practically non-existant (unqualified assistant hates her demanding boss), the ending unsatisfying and contrived and the writing, well, the author's craft definitely needs maturing."
3,Great Beach Read,"This book is not a literay piece, but a great beach read sort of book that will make you lol in some places or gasp in others.Worth buying or checking out at the library. Miranda is absolutely heartless!"
2,"Worthy of its reviews . . . good, bad, and indifferent","This book is an adolescent romp by an author that has penned an anecdote that doesn't convey the sympathy for the lead character I think she was going for . . . and frankly, there really isn't a single character that's very likable . . . if we're suppose to condone the lead character expensing numerous items to her employer as retaliation, the author has a twisted set of values. Taking into consideration the author's youth, it's an adequate first novel.The story does share some insider perspective on the fashion publishing industry . . . although, her lack of discretion in sharing a former employer's idiosyncrasies and eccentricities may not be a good move for one so young."
1,Sad attempt to clone the pizazz of the Shopaholic series,"This book was an desperate attempt to clone the Shopaholic books by Kinsella. Sadly, it was way off the mark. The characters were not interesting, the plot was weak, and it was just plain boring. Unless you are a person who is excited just to read the names of fashion labels, you will not be enthralled with this pick."
1,boring and bland,"Boring, the author has no writing skills, she is not funny, not interesting. Really, there is not much to say about it other than it is a WASTE OF YOUR MONEY."
5,I LOVED this book.,"It was entertaining, it grabbed me right away and I read it straight through. Surprisingly, I have read a lot of nasty, negative comments about the author (ungrammatical, inept writer, no plot, etc...)and all I can say is the people who are saying those nasssssty things are probably really jealous that they didn't write something so fresh and hoppin' when they were right out of college. I loved the fist Shopaholic book but this was better."
4,It's gotta be the shoes,"An easy predictable pleasurable read, I loved the portrayal of the many fashion editors balanced with the main characters parents. I would love to have seen both at the launch party for ""Devil wears Prada."" Not a book I am proud to have read, but certainly one I enjoyed.Michael Duranko, Bootism: a shoe religion"
2,Devil in what?,This book not only failed to satisfy my carnivorous hunger for guilty pleasure reading but it strected on longer than needed. How many chapters can one read about describing the silly hoops a boss will take you thur? I never felt a strong connection to the main character and never felt any empathy whatsoever. I waited a long time to read this book and wish I would have waited longer.
1,The best thing about this book is the title.,"And it is the only good thing. I came to the conclusion at the end of this whiney diatribe by a spoiled, phony, ridiculous, mediocre excuse for an employee, that the devil was not Miranda, but Andrea.Skip it."
2,Cliche and contrived,"I could not get past page 38 of this unfunny, cliche and contrived material. The protagonist is most mundane without a single interesting character trait. The ""boss from hell"" character lacks any substance or believability. I skimmed the rest of the book and read the ending, which was - how else can I put it? - cliche. Totally not worth your time, unless you're stuck at the airport with nothing better to do."
3,Just give me some more stress...,"I have to agree with the other reviewer that mentioned it was hard to sympathize with Andrea. Her passive-agressive behavior was a complete turn-off. Besides, after my own stressful day, I found it hard to read the rantings of someone else's stress. Had to finish it on a day off!"
3,Bridget Jones 10 years on,"This is a great book--I found it hard to put down, and it's the perfect companion for all those recent college grads slogging through their morning commutes (or perhaps their jobs). But ultimately Weisberger offers little original here; she just plays a series of riffs that she knows will sell plenty of copies. If you like Madonna better than Britney Spears, you'll like Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones' Diary better than The Devil Wears Prada. Fielding employs many of the same rhetorical techniques as Weisberger--using lots of brand names and silly hyperbole to conjure vivid images--but her writing also doubles as social criticism, something that Weisberger's agent presumably advised against."
3,Nothing more or less than...O.K,"This book is nothing more than what it promises to be... a light read and laugh at the over pretencious fashion world, the need to please and the true bitchiness that a woman can poses. Nothing particularly sparked wihtin the 360 page account but the much anticipated (as well as predictable)ending was to necessary to shut the book on."
4,Great escape,"This isn't great literature but is is entertaining. A nice change of pace from heavy and meaningful. I true ""chic-lit"" novel from the opening line to the end of the book. Every once in a while it is nice to lose yourself in a book that is pure fantasy and entertainment."
4,"Enertaining, but some editing mistakes!","I don't see how anyone could find this book boring! It is definitely only for enertainment, but I enjoyed every page! I really got upset whenever Miranda would tell Andrea to do something outrageous and could almost feel Andrea's stress. The stories about her boss were hilarious! I did have a little problem with the editing, however. Lauren Weisberger mentioned Target's line, Mossimo, but spelled it Massimo. Also, she mentioned that Miranda received a makeup set from Bobbi Brown, but it was spelled Bobby Brown. I believe others have mentioned the issue with the Harry Potter books. (in the book they came out in January, but in actual life they came out in June.) Besides that, I thought this book was terrific and especially good for an author's very first novel!"
1,Just painful,"Boring and painful. Andy never quits whining or smoking long enough to partially resemble someone you would want to do well. I would have prefered for her to have been fired, disgraced, and thrown out on the curb."
2,F U is the best you can do?,"When I saw that Meryl Streep was to be in this movie I figured it had to be a good.I was wrong.Tedious,repetitive,bigoted and whiny do not make for funny.I kept thinking perhaps a stint as a student nurse at an inner city hospital would do Andrea some good.This book could have used some major editing.I had to wonder who the author knew."
2,Disappointed,"Each disaster is no different than the next, and the plot doesn't go anywhere. I was disappointed. The concept is great and I can see how it fueled a good movie, but the book itself was not very entertaining."
2,Not nasty enough,"Miranda is not diabolical enough. She's just chilly. Annoying, of course, but the self-pitying heroine is soooo obsessed with every teeny slight that she loses our sympathy; enough already. Meanwhile supposedly venomous Miranda is really no more than moderatley inconsiderate. I kept waiting for something mean. Never happened. Bring back Les Liaisons Dangereuses, or Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, for real devils. This book was a pallid whinge."
4,The Devil Wears Sweatpants,"The devil doesn't wear Prada, the devil wears sweatpants. The main character of this book infuriated me as much as she was infuriated by her boss. She was unappreciative, unprofessional, lazy, and immature. Her boss demanded the best for the right reasons. The portrayal of the fashion-loving fools was great, and this book had many laughs. At the same time, it was great to see how anybody can demonize others while they themselves aren't the Archangel Gabriel, either. 4 out of 5 stars - a must read."
4,HILARIOUS.,"I usually dont buy novels but this one caught my attention at the book store because of its unusual cover. I was convinced on buying the book when I saw that it was about a person (Andrea Sachs) struggling to keep her job because of all the crazy things her boss (Miranda Priestly) makes her do.I truly recommend this book to everyone who, in some time of their professional life, has had an ""impossible boss"". Believe me, you will really enjoy this book."
3,Kerr canning lids,"I wanted a kerr canning lid so i googled it what a joke I'm upset at the company that makes the lid all they did was plop a lid in the box that says kerr on the front it is exactly the same lid as the they have in ball boxes. That is false advertising. Won't order online again unless I know what I'm getting. Even in your review you picture a box of kerr canning lids with a picture of a lid with kerr written on it that not at all how it came, but that is diffidently how I remember that they used to look and that is what I wanted. So I took a chance in ordering never again felt like a fool. But what would you and all other by mail companies really care you at least got me to buy and you have you money."
5,Great for camping trips or just lounging on the deck!,"This one of a kind Coleman Portable Bug Zapper will make your evenings more enjoyable. No more cords to mess with. Great by the fire or by the front porch. This portable, rechargeable bug zapper goes just about anywhere to keep the bugs at a distance all night long. The best part is that it comes with a remote control (not pictured) so you never have to go near the bugs again."
1,this is a fake,"This seller advertised Kerr canning jar lids as 'new' - but the box was old, opened and re-closed with scotch tape, with the 99 cents canning jar lids inserted instead of the Kerr brand. Those who can know that Kerr is the Rolls-Royce of jars and lids, and is the only manufacturer worth more than 99c for a dozen lids. To have a seller substitute a used Kia claiming to be a new Rolls is simply fraud."
2,these are for the little jars...,"the labeling and description for the Kerr Lids is very confusing, and picture doesn't help. I bought these because i thought they would fit our large mason jars, only to receive them and learn they are too small. Returning them was not worth the time and money. So now i have a bunch of lids and no jars."
3,Great Seller,"The product arrived quickly, well packaged, and as advertised. I would definitely recommend this seller. However, I am not pleased with the manufacturer, Jarden. These lids are the same as the Ball lids. They just come in a box that say Kerr. I was looking for the old type Kerr lids with the raised letters stamped, ""Kerr."" They always sealed better for me. They are apparently no longer available - Sad."
2,Hard Rock Just Misses the Mark,"Having lived in Tulsa and attended some of the Tar Creek Superfund conferences, I had high expectations of this book, was eager to read it and was prepared to like it. Obviously Mr. Sims has experiences and life history worth sharing. However, in this attempt to tell share some of this history (as historical fiction) his writing appears padded and strained. The characters were caricatures and, while I wanted to care about them, I had difficulty extending that empathy. It seemed that Mr. Sims was aspiring to be Erskine Caldwell-ish; however, he fell short of the mark and Hard Rock is no Tobacco Road."
1,These cables do not work,"The listing for this is very vague and wholesalecables JUST added to it, of course after I bought the product and tried to return it. But it had said it was a ""great accessory for a computer""(which it still says), and I intended to use it computer to older tv, since the computer had a VGA port, but the tv did not. Now it says not intended for input or output with computer. So how does that make it still the ""perfect accessory""?It didn't work as an accessory with my computer, so I returned it as not what was listed. I would never buy from wholesalecables again because their listings is not descriptive or clear what the product was for and a waste of my time trying to make it work and then returning it."
1,I couldn't see anything in this film to reconmend it.,"The story is crap. The acting is lame. Could of been quite entertaining, but it looks like they made it up as they went along. The story seems to do a right angle half way through and then goes nowhere. Not much naughty bits to write home to mother about either. Save your money and use your imagination. You will be better rewarded."
1,Ugh,"This movie didn't come close to the standards set by Porky's or numerous other 70s and 80s -vintage skin flicks that became popular. The women were okay looking, but there was not a hint of the situational circumstances that cause nudity to be arousing, as occured in Revenge of the Nerds, Porky's, or Harold and Kumar go to White Castle; any teenager could come up with a better story. If you are in it only for the nudity, you could do as well or better just about anywhere."
3,"Funny, interesting but not good enough","This is a soft-core movie. There are some amazing beautiful women in this movie. The story looks okay for me, but the actors look not professional and act not naturally. The director could make it more professional and entertaining."
2,"Excellent Writing, But Where's the Ending?","This book picks up about a year after ""The Pride of Chanur"" leaves off. From the very first moment, you're caught up in the plot and furiously trying to turn the pages faster and faster in order to see what's going to happen. But, then, after about 170 pages of extremely well written, tightly packed, emotionally wrenching, pages, right at the very pinnacle of tension, it ENDS! Aaaargh! There's no excuse for this except pure greed on the part of the publisher. This book should never have been published without its sequel, ""The Kif Strike Back."" I feel really bad giving such an excellent piece of work such a bad rating. But, unless you have the sequel handy (perhaps as part of the ""omnibus edition"" ""The Chanur Saga"" (which apparently ends without ITS finish)), I can't recommend you read it. If you've got the sequel(s), definitely read all of them. But, don't get just this book."
2,Average at best,"I can't understand why so many people have said that this author's works are ""well written"". Cherryh's style of disjoint, clipped sentances along with her lack of detail on so many subjects which are crucial to the understanding of the interplay in the political game she is striving to describe, make reading her books aggravating in the extreme.That is not to say that she doesn't have some good ideas and that her plot is not interesting. She does, and it is. But it is so hard to read! Her character interaction in a galatcic pidgin english doesn't help things either.These books are readable, if nothing better is around, but they could have been oh so much better."
2,Old West Coast Beats + Not Enough Frost= Average Album,""" THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM WAS BECAUSE I SAW FROST ON THE COVER, WHEN I HEARD THE ALBUM I WAS LIKE,""IS THAT IT?"" THE FIRST 3 SONGS ARE STRAIGHT WACK AND E 4O PUTS LITTLE LYRICAL EFFORT INTO HIS CONTRIBUTION ON ""FO SHO"". THE BEATS ARE REAL OLD FASHIONED BAY AREA STYLE. IT IS DEFINITELY UNAPPEALING TO THOSE WHO ARE FROM OTHER PARTS OF CALI. OR THE REST OF THE NATION. ITS BASICALLY AN N2DEEP ALBUM,TRYING TO ACT LIKE A BUNCH OF ITALIAN MAFIOSOS, 2 STARS WAS GENEROUS......I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!! OH BYE THE WAY,YOU WILL BEG TO HEAR FROST ON THIS ALBUM BECAUSE THESE GUYS ARE SO WACK."""
3,Good book.,Not as exciting as her first book but still entertaining. I enjoyed the ending as well as the zany humor throughout the book.
1,Simply awful,"I put the first tape on and thought the narrater had something wrong with her, the inflections went up and down like a yo-yo. I got to tape five and there was only half a tape. It all sounded like it was made of a second-hand tape-recorder. There was no way I could contact the seller to complain..Money totally wasted..."
4,Great story,The details are very vivid and riveting. A story you could wish you were a part of. Anticipation on where he will go from here.
3,Adapted Version,This edition is adapted by Harold and Geraldine Woods. It is not the story as written by Edgar Rice Burroughs but a simple retelling for young children.
5,I loved it!!!!!,This book is easily one of the best I have ever read. I couldn't put it down!! Edgar Rice Burroughs made Tarzan seem so real. I'm going to read all of the other books in the Tarzan series.
3,"great story, I wish it were all there.","I was a little bummed. I got this after reading an unedited version and was disappointed to find this one was censored. Not even the Modern Library Classics edition presents the entire, original text.Apparently, sometime in the 60's, the Burroughs estate excised certain things to make it seem less racist. Reading it now makes me wonder what's the point."
4,A classic which only dims under later 20th century notions.,"The writing is largely crisp and no-nonsense, more interested in telling its tale than bogging down with ""what it all means"". It paints vivid pictures of the African jungle and what life would be like for a man who could survive it.The fact that it's ""unrealistic"" is irrelevant, and more a reflection on our current obsession with ""accurately reflecting the world as we believe it to be at this exact moment in time"" than with good literature, (Shakespeare is rife with inaccuracies also, so what?).This book was good enough that I spent the next month reading the 25-odd sequels in the series. How many ca. 1915 era books can one say THAT about?"
5,Edgar Rice Burroughs.... the King..,"I have been reading all of his books since I was old enough to first pickup a book. I have read everything he ever wrote, and can say without a doubt his works are still thrilling and engrossing despite the years. Sure, there is nothing politcally correct about his books, but you have to remember WHEN these books were first written..and any attempt to water them down is a travesty. I still have first edition copies given to me by my father who purchased them when they were first published.Lose yourself in one of his wonderful books....step back in time..and enjoy. Recommended for all ages... I still pick them up when I want to be transported to other worlds."
4,A very good story. Might deserve 5stars.,"A very good story. None of the film adaptations come even close. All the films deviate from the story and none of them come with anything more moving or interesting than the original story. If you've been duped into believing that the Disney version or Greystoke the Legend of Tarzan are true to the book then you need to read this book and see what Tarzan is really all about. The characters are interesting and the action scenes are well written. The story is not deep, but it is compelling and the ending is perfectly bitter sweet. And if you must have a happy ending read The Return of Tarzan; it picks up exactly where Tarzan ends and concludes with a more Hollywood ending."
4,A simple concept that makes a great story,"The only Tarzan I ever knew of was the Disney cartoon. I used to love watching it, and to be honest, I stil like it. However, when I saw this book for free, I decided to try it, just to have something to read.From the very start, this book draws you in with great descriptions and vivid imagery. The story begins with a young english couple who get stranded on the coast of Africa. All goes well until the woman gets attacked by a gorilla. She gives birth shortly after, but she is never the same as she was before.The woman dies sometime after, and her husband gets kiled by a Bull ape. Kala, a kind female ape, sees the baby who had just lost his parents nd decides"
4,Tarzan of the Apes : Tarzan No. 1,Fantastic start for older children. Collectors will appreciate this book too.
4,Great Classic Read,"Nearly everyone knows the story of Tarzan, whether their education came from movies, television, or cartoons. None have done justice to Burroughs' book though. I read this book as a teenager, and it still ranks up there with my favorite adventure novels. 'Tarzan' should be on everyone's must read list - it's an essential classic."
5,Timeless perfection,"Just one of the most timeless and fun reads of all time. If you haven't read this book, stop what you are doing and start reading it."
5,tarzan of the Apes,saw most of the movies but never read the book till now completely different but very realistic I really liked it
4,Tarzan review,Nice to finally read one of the classics and not have to create a new wing in my library for a thick book
5,Tarzan,"If you like writing in times of old language, then this book is for you. I found it very refreshing as far as the real story, not like the one Disney has. If you like a different read, this book is a good one!"
2,It took too long to get to the point of the story.,"Tarzan is about a little boy that gets stuck on the island when he is first born and after a few days or months the Apes attacked his family and killed them. After the Apes killed his mother and father the Apes took him out of his crib and they dropped their own dead fetus. They took Tarzan. A few years later Tarzan became a heathy young man.Tarzan was removed from the jungle and was moved with one of his family members. Well this family member died so Tarzan returned to the jungle again.Thats my review of this book and I didnt like it, so I would not tell others to read this book."
5,Tarzan of the Apes,Oustanding action and a different look at wild beasts and their comparison to civilized man. Great action.
4,A swingin' good time!,"This was one of my favorite books as a child and it is still a thrilling read! If you think you know the story of Tarzan but have never read the book, do yourself a favor and read it. There has not been a Tarzan movie made that does the book justice. It is really amazing how much action and adventure is packed into this story. And, If you really like it, there are many more E.R. Burroughs' Tarzan books to read."
5,A HERO FOR ALL TIME!,"this is where it all began folks. You seen Tarzan in the movies and now in cartoons - but believe me, as good as they all were, it ain't Tarzan! Only the original novels bring this larger than life character his full due! If you haven't read it - you simply must!"
5,Meet the real Tarzan; where it all began!,TARZAN OF THE APES tells the original story of the nearly invincible ape man. Burroughs tells a gripping story of how Tarzan became what he is. Read this novel and discover for yourself just why the Tarzan legend continues to intrigue people of all ages! You'll read this one and want to complete the series!
1,print too small,"The print did not take up the whole page and was far too small for easy reading. The story is good, but not in this format."
4,fun read,"Downloaded this and ""Return of"". Read these when I was a ""tween"". 50 years later and I am impressed with how well they've withstood the test of time. Burroughs' writing is vivid and still comfortable to read. His characters are fun, diverse and believable. His vocabulary and language don't seem dated. I definitely want to check out some of his other series and will probably read a few more ""Tarzan""s. They would be great reading for 5th or 6th graders also."
4,AN ADVENTURE STORY FOR THE YOUNG AT HEART,"A MEMORY FROM MY YOUTH AGOOD STRAIGHT FORWARD STORY CLEARLY TOLD, WITH GOOD GOODIES AND EVIL BADDIES. i WILL BE BUYING (HAVE BOUGHT )THE COMPLETE SET OF THE TARZAN BOOKS AND AM ENJOYING THEM ."
2,A Staggeringly Mediocre Book,"Judging by some of the reviews here, I may get lynched for this...Despite his longevity and universal appeal, Tarzan got off to a crachingly poor start. His story is interesting-I'll give Burroughs that much-but the writing is unimpressive. Burroughs was not first and foremost a writer, and perhaps he was uncomfortable with the attempt, but this book is verbose and quite honestly inept. It seems to me as if while Burroughs was clunkily setting down his prose, he would leaf through a thesaurus every time an idea was in the least bit sophisticated.Is Tarzan worth reading? Yes, as a sort of early compendium of the serial hero's requred traits, an insight into adventure and science fiction. You may get an insight into later works, like Star Wars and especially Indiana Jones. But don't expect to be captivated."
3,Its free LOL,Haven't read this story since I was a kid. Took a while to get used to the diction used and you can tell the times that it was written with the attitudes of the characters towards each other. Wonder how he would write the story in modern times.
2,Questionable,The plot was excellent. At first i thought it was wonderful. Then i thought of some concer ns. Tarzan Killing the the black men. I dont think the author needed to include that or kerchaks rages. There are probably a few more concerns I forgot to mention.
4,CANT BEAT THE PRICE!!!,"I received my product 1 week after i ordered. So far so good. My only complaint is that I didn't quite like the end connectors because they're shorter than usual...making it harder to unplug. The quality is not the best but what do you expect...for the price of 9.70 + 4.99 delivery, you just can't beat it!!! This is my first time ordering from Amazon and I can't complaint."
5,"Very strong on getting help, relationships and communication","This book is not so much about self-care -- exercise, diet, medications, relaxation and such -- but it is very strong on getting the support you need to live successfully with a chronic condition. I used her material extensively in writing The Art of Getting Well: Maximizing Health When You Have a Chronic Illness.Most of us don't like to ask for help. It makes us feel weak, guilty, needy or even ""un-American."" But mutual assistance is the way the world works. Register gives powerful reasons to ask for and accept help, likely places to find it, and ways of paying people back. She points out that most people like to help, and that we can help others in our turn.Her book is also very strong on dealing with the medical profession and financial issues, how to keep your illness from impoversihing you. She continues to thrive with her condition, teaches at a university and has written several more books. She is an inspiring and practical teacher."
5,Perfect Lawn Mower for small yard,"We recently ""downsized"" the lawn area of our backyard to a 16' x 22' area and wanted something light weight and compact to mow the yard with. After reading the reviews on Amazon, we decided to take a chance on the Worx 16-Inch Electric Lawn Mower. My husband LOVES THIS MACHINE! It was our first mowing after having new sod put in and the lawn was pretty long but it mowed like a dream! He has no complaints whatsoever with it in anyway. He said it went together without any problems (read your manual prior to assembling and you won't have the problems others have mentioned!!!). We were equally surprised that it came with a two year warranty! Its a great buy and a great lawn mower. We highly recommend it!"
1,Dead On Arrival!!,"My unit was dead ""out of the box"". Called Worx Customer Service where they offered no assistance. Said they'd help if I'd purchased directly from them. Referred me to Amazon. Packing it up and sending it back for a replacement. I'll update my review once the return process completes.Addendum (4/18/2008): Unit was replaced within 3 days. Thus far, replacement unit is working as expected."
5,GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY!,"This is a great product for individuals looking for a basic mower. It runs just as well as a Black and Decker corded mower, yet its cheaper. I like the styling and performance.A great buy!"
1,CHEAPLY MADE!!!!,"Had this mower for less than 3 years and the start button malfunctioned. The start button won't even depress. Took it apart to evaluate it and realized how poorly and cheaply its made. My child's playskool toys are made sturdier and technical than the parts of the mower. Called the company and they referred me to an authorized repair shop that wanted $120 to repair, and they stated that the start button has been a reoccuring issue with some of the models. For $120 to fix a start button, I rather buy a new mower. DO NOT RECOMMEND WORX MOWERS!"
4,Worx fine so far,"I've only used it once so far. It's about what I expected. Did a decent job cutting the grass at the highest setting (2-3/4""). Putting it together wasn't so bad; as others have said snapping the grass collection bag together was the hardest part, but after about 15 minutes I got it all together. It's possible to fold the handle forward so it stores in a fairly compact form.The main drawback is exactly what you'd expect for a corded electric mower - you have to keep moving the cord so you don't run over it. It's a pain when you first start out, or are trying to go around trees and stuff. Once you settle into a pattern however it's not that bad. And I have a small lawn, so it's not a big deal. I would rather deal with the inconvenience of a cord, versus have to store gasoline with little kids around, and put out multiple cars' worth of emissions from a small gasoline engine."
2,Did the job for 2 years then died,"The lawn mower mowed our mid sized lawn, went through grass that was a bit too long. Bought it in 2008, took it out this spring, switch was touchy took a wiggle to get it to work, then wouldn't start at all."
2,Not Dependable,"Worx 16"" Electric Lawn Mower died within a year. Power was intermittent, depending on how the cord was positioned. Always held the extension cord (#12) to avoid any stress on the mowers pig-tail plug. I suppose I will open it up and check continuity, but it is probably the flimsy power cord connection under the handle that needs replacing. I wonder if or how this was ever UL approved . . . ."
1,no manual or instructions,"did not come with any manual, there is a small piece which I do not know its purpose. Do not know hw to make it mulch. Having problem putting grass catcher together so I can fifure out how to attach.Have used it just by mowing and shaking since grass can't be ejected or mulched. What a mess. I need a manual with some good instructions. Until I receive, I can say nothing positive other than it cuts the grass."
4,Perfect Size,"This mower works great with the 13 Amp motor while most brands feature 12 Amps. The size (16"") allows it to fit beside the car in a standard two car garage. There were only two things that I disliked about this mower. Putting the catcher together is very difficult. The other is that the height adjuster doesn't quite go high enough for tall grass. The mulcher attachment works great. I would buy this mower again."
1,"Worx 13-Amp 16"" Electric Lawn Mower","Nice looking, but difficult to assemble the grass collector bag. It's not so powerful as lawn mower powered by gas engine, and not as good as lawn mower powered by gas engine. I will not buy any kind of electric lawn mower in future unless it will have a big improvement on the power."
1,DON'T BUY THIS LAWN MOWER!,"I bought this after reading some of the positive reviews. Assembling it was not too difficult, in spite of the poor instructions. However, I simply could not ""snap"" together the grass catcher. After trying for over 15 minutes, I gave up since I intended to use the cut grass for mulching anyway. I found the performance to be just so-so; nothing to rave about. Well, I have now used it exactly three times, and it has decided to quit working! I have cleaned everything including the blade area, and there is nothing else I can do to see what's wrong because all moving parts are encased in this plastic ""box"".I called Amazon customer service, and I was told to call the manufacturer. I'll do that, but I anticipate big hassles to box and send it back even if they are willing to fix it.My advise is DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Terrible customer service - DON'T BUY!,I bought this product 6 weeks ago and after three uses the starter button broke. I called Worx customer service only to be told there IS NO REPAIR CENTER!! No repair options! No replacement after thirty days! I was told by Worx customer service to contact Amazon for replacement/repair options. Amazon says sorry nothing they can do. WHAT A RIP-OFF! DO NOT buy this mower. If you have any problems with it after 30 days you are OUT OF LUCK. The warranty is useless.
1,Unreliable,"After four uses, the power cord shorted out where it enters the unit handle. It's now a large, expensive brick."
2,"Piece O Junk, Avoid....Dangerous Item","hard to push, that roller on back is unnessary, had to mow backwards, why they make electrics mowers out of cheap plastic, I don't know. brackets that go around front tires are cracked and wheels are wobbley and ready to fall off, impossible to assemble grass catcher box, (who tested that?), not real powerful, kept switching off...best thing is the Italian design, couldn't resist because it was so cute. Guess I'll get a grass hog something not as cute but more reliable"
2,2 Season Mower,"This machine is nice at the beginning because it is quiet and no fumes to deal with.However, the body is not well constructed. The back part of the mower is made of plasticand after two season of mowing with this machine it broke. If you pay this much for a mower I expected to last longer.I am very disappointed in this product."
2,Not there yet,"We bought this to do some areas that a rider rower can't access, and loved the idea of reducing our carbon footprint. But our staff handyman hates it, says it takes him 3 times as long to mow, and it's not strong enough to do a good job."
5,Lawnmower,This is an excellent machine and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a lawnmower. The price I paid was just right as well.
4,An Important and Thought-Provoking Book,"I want to recommend this book to anyone who is troubled by the fact that the US is the country with the world's second highest incarceration rate, right after Russia: currently, 1.7 million Americans are in prison or jail. Half of all prison inmates are African American. It is impossible to summarize the author's subtle and well documented analyses in a few sentences. He convincingly shows that these numbers are not, or are not merely, due to high rates of criminal activity, but rather to factors such as social inequality, inordinate media attention given to crime, political demagoguery (""get tough on crime""), and a long legacy of racial discrimination. Mauer makes many suggestions for a more humane and effective response to crime than the current ""race to incarcerate."" He concludes his book with the moving appeal to stop ""caging the least fortunate among us to solve our problems."" Read it!!"
3,Too Large to be Read,"I purchased volume one because I knew a piece I wanted was in it. It is a 4 inch thick 8-1/2x11 leather bound volume. A collectors item for a coffee table - much too heavy to be held.It is also available in electronic format, and is a delight to read on my Kindle. The stories of the pioneers in electricity are fascinating."
5,Great!,The killers cd is so awesome! I saw them in concert and it was just awesome. Somebody told me is somewhat like a 80s Techno punk sound... Its really great you should check them out!
2,Sorry,"I'm sorry, but I can't stand this song. And what the hell is techno/disco/punk? I think we're getting a little too out of hand with classifying music. I just don't see what's so special about this song, the vocals are annoying, I'm not digging the disco-feel to it. Personally, I think it's trash."
