3,Relaxing but redundant,"This is quite a beautiful collection of calming, relaxing songs in a classical, somewhat celtic style. There is, however, very little variation between the songs, and most of them are too similar to be distinct by themselves. Still, Jayne Elleson has wonderful vocals and Philip Riley excellent piano melodies. Briton Drums gets a little more into the celtic feeling, but I wanted to hear more percussion. My favorite song is probably Spin the Circle Down, which brings images of European medieval times to my mind, and has beautiful lyrics. It would be a very nice collection if there was more variation, but it's still a lovely, softening album as it is."
2,Mastering problems,Mastering problems with this one - I have had two copies and they glitch during the Alanis section of the disk.
1,Might have been good if all the parts came.....,"The Thule sidekick came without one of the hinges and with one of the strike plates for the latch half assembled and incorrectly. Calling Thule customer serivce, well, I gave up after 4 20 min period on hold over the course of a week. I sent them an e-mail, no reply, I wrote a paper letter, no reply. I needed to use the item so it was a trip to the hardware store and I had to rig and manage the repairs myself. Quality control at Thule and customer service seem non-existent. I would try other brands, after all it's only a plastic box and some hardware."
4,"It Works well for what it is, but has big limitations","I have had this product for about 8 years. It works. It works pretty well. The hinges feel very flimsy but they have not broken. The locks feel cheap but they work ok. The thing doesn't make much noise on the top of the car and never comes loose. It's not waterproof and mine leaks a little in a downpour.The biggest problem is it is small. But you know that when you buy. The attachment system (ubolts with knobs) and the hinges cut into that small capacity and make it even smaller and more limited. If I had it to do over, I might get a bigger box. But now that I have a cargo tray and bag, I don't need it to be bigger so it worked out ok.But you aren't going to get a lot in this box, I try to pack soft things in it, but they have to be things that can get wet."
4,Thule 682 Sidekick Rooftop Cargo Box review,"This is a good buy for the money. However, it took both my husband and I to put it together. Not a one person job! We went through several storms and the carrier did not leak! Saw a minor difference in the way the van drove with the carrier on."
4,adequate storage,"For the money, this product is a great buy. It was easy to put together and the instructions were clear. Thule has a reputation for quality products. I am very pleased. Works well for weekends away. It does only have 8 cu feet so if you need more this wouldn't work."
5,"Great Value, met all my needs",Perfect amount of extra space when we take four people on vacation with our Highlander. Does in fact hold two sets of golf clubs. Well made and easy to put together and on vehicle with two people.
5,Great system,"Ditto other customers who had positive feedback. We just got back from taking this box and the four bags (sold seperate) to the Grand Canyon from Central Texas. It worked great. Four full bags were a little tight, but the weight is only supposed to around 100 pounds. Assembly was quick when you follow the instructions (hint, hint :>). Get the bags to go along with it they are very sturdy. Many people write the box is flimsy..it's supposed to be lightweight so they can put they heavy junk inside."
1,"Horrible to assemble, poorly designed","This product is very poorly designed and extremely frustrating to put together. (And we have assembled many other things before without trouble...) We hope it works out, now that we have endured a huge hassle putting it together."
4,Thule sidekick,"I received my cargo box a few weeks ago. It was just what I expected after reading other reviews. However, the front main hinge was damaged when I received it and I can not find any Thule contact phone #. I registered the product online with Thule and explained the situation, but they have yet to contact me about it to replace the broken part. I'm a little frustrated now because they don't have a phone # to call them and they don't respond to emails on their own website. If you're lucky enough to get the product unharmed then it would be great, but good luck getting any issues resolved from the company."
2,"FAR, FAR TOO COSTLY FOR THE QUALITY","This cargo box is attractive and very lightweight, but quality, and probably durability, is cut dramatically in order to achieve that end. My biggest concern with this is the way the arms that hold the top up are attached. The ball joint is inserted into a simple plastic joint, which is far too flimsy. If this item cost only $50, that weak construction would be expected, but it is not acceptable for an item this expensive."
4,As advertised,"Actually we were really pleased with the Cargo Box. We have a larger Thule so we have one to compare it to. We needed something distinctly smaller that would fit on top of a fully loaded CRV for a 2400 mile trip. No complaints at all.Some observations: Yes, it seems a little flimsy compared to the ""real"" Thule boxes but that comes with the price. It's been very durable but a little disconcerting when the suitcases bend the sides over as you take them out. There's never been any damage to the box or hardware however.We experienced some rain and not a hint of leaking. However after one hot buggy day the inside had dozens of small insects inside; the front of the Thule was plastered. Bugs got inside but no rain. Go figure.Yes, I'd buy it again. A good serviceable cargo box that does exactly what it says. Just don't think the ""real"" Thule when you buy this."
3,a bit small,"worked great, no leaks, but it did not fit that much. I would purchase a bigger one next time around."
1,A Piece of Junk.,This cargo carrier is so flimsy that I thought it would fall apart before I got to my destination. The hinges are a joke and barely work. It is also a nightmare to assemble.
1,Junk,"It was impossible to assemble.(1) One of the nuts, needed to secure one of the locks, had no threads so we couldn't attach one of the two side-locks.(2) The side arm-hinges allow you to open the top and hold it open. Both side arm-hinges were for the same side of the cargo box so we couldn't use them.(3) The edge-hinges were very difficult to attach, and it took two of us to do it.Even if we had the right hardware to assemble the cargo box, I would not trust it to stay closed while driving over 50 MPH down the highway. My suggestion to anyone interested in buying a cargo box is to buy a more substantial box (heavier) and ideally one that is already assembled! Don't buy this one.Post Script: When we took our son to college, we squeezed everything into the car and did not use the cargo box. When I got back, I dis-assembled the cargo box and returned it for a full refund. It was a pain to re-pack it but the Amazon process for returning items was excellent! I was VERY impressed with Amazon."
5,Perfect Size for a Subaru Outback,"Yes, this box is not as thick and heavy as the larger pro-line boxes....and that's precisely why I like it! It provides about 50% more storage space for my Outback wagon and looks nicely proportioned to the car (not like those bigger monster-sized boxes would look on top of a small wagon).While some folks have said it took 2 people to assemble, I was able to do it myself just fine. It's also lightweight enough to put on and take off of the car by myself as well (I'm a middle-aged female). Once you start loading it up, it doesn't wobble around anymore and provides a good secure, dry enclosure. I was able to haul a tent, chairs, sleeping bags and other camping gear in it with no problems.Well worth the money. Very nice product!"
4,Thule 682 Sidekick Rooftop Cargo Box,"Well I am using this 682 as a one wheel trailer to tow behind a motorcycle. It is set on a light frame and is still under construction at this time. The unit is just the right length. Installed stop lights, trun signals lights and clearance lights in the unit. I like the lock set up and the side loading. It only weights 35 lbs. If all goes well it will be going on a long tip this summer."
4,rooftop cargo carrier,The sidekick fits perfectly on our Subaru outback. Don't be deceived by its looks-holds more than you expect. Sturdy and closes nicely. Con- wish it had a thumb holder by lock.
1,Arrived missing parts,"This arrived missing some critical parts - the hinge assembly on one side. How it made it through the Thule assembly process is amazing, obviously nobody looked at it before shipping it. The hinge looks like it is installed at the factory and is not something that I could install if they sent me one.I have seen a few other reviewers of this product complain of the same problem.Amazon took the unit back, paid for shipping, and refunded my money. The return was very easy, all I had to do was go to the ""orders"" section and click on the ""return"" option. Amazon handled it all, I didnt have to contact UPS or anything. The next day UPS showed up at my house and took the box. 5 stars for the Amazon return policy and process.I ended up buying the SportRack A90275 Aero XL Roof Box. That comes preassembled."
3,"Specs are WAY off. Actual usable dimensions: 52""x21""x15""","Title says it. I have to carry rectangular yard signs measuring 40""x24"". I know the box is tapered at the bottom, but at worst I figured I would have to put some stuff in the bottom to bring the signs up to the part that is 25"" wide.No dice. The cardboard box this came in measures 53.5""x24.5""x12.5"", so I don't know how Thule came up with 54x25. (The 15"" height seems to be fairly accurate for the exterior) I can understand being off an inch due to interior vs exterior dimensions, but the exterior width is an inch less than what it says on the box.I'm taking dimensional photos to add to this listing, and I'll be returning this to Amazon."
5,Water tight easy way to carry extra items,"Bought this for a trip back east from California. It survived the torrential rain preceding the tornados and flooding of Iowa, Kansas and Illinois with maybe 3 drops of water inside. Travelled so well could not even feel it on the roof. Very economical way to carry those extra items. Relatively easy to assemble and installed on the roof of my Escape very easily. I would recommend this product."
2,Does not fit Outback 2012 factory cross bars,Thule Sidekick does not fit Subaru Outback 2012 factory crossbars. See REI reviewer explaining that you need to drill extra holes to get it to work.[...] Thule need to revisit their Fit Guide and remove the Outback 2012 from being a compatible vehicle with this product.
4,Thule 682 Sidekick Rooftop Cargo Box,Nice product that is doing the job. I'm only little bit nervous about the locking mechanism and I'm using additional ratcheting band to secure it. But this is only me and I saw a lot of people that are OK without anything additional to secure the box.
4,sidekick performed well,"The sidekick assembled easily. It is very light and easy to install on th roof of my VW Tiguan. A little bit flimsy but very usable. I have taken it on a 1000 mile trip with no issues. Gas mileage is about 1 mpg less than normal, not much of a sacrifice for the added storage. I would recommend this to a friend."
3,Its ok,"I dont have a problem with this product, but did go back to money 98, its the one I like the best."
4,Beyond the Zone System,"The title of this book really summarized the book. It gives the theory behind the procedures that many advanced photographers already know and use. I don't know of many people who are going to apply his techniques directly, i.e. sensometers, etc. Rather this book gives a theoretical basis for some of the techniques that Adams and others used. It essentially gives university or grad level experiments to allow the reader to test and prove the concepts for themselves. So if you were looking for a ""How to Book"", you will be disappointed. Read Peterson's book, first. Learn how to apply the zone system. Then read this book to understand what you are doing."
1,"I have been waiting for over four months for my book, but still haven't recived it yet.","I ordered a book in August and have been waiting for the book for several months. I received an e-mail that said the book I ordered would be delivered on Sept.1, however, I have never received the book and I was charged for book in later August. I wrote down e-mail and sent to seller through Amazon.com twice, however, no one responded me. In later Sept., I sent an e-mail to seller directly, but still, no one responded me. It is my first bad experience from online shopping. I'm very upset now. I need get my money back!"
3,its ok,"I really only bought this cd for ""get a job."" they kinda sound like green day. Only one or two good songs"
5,I remember...,"Where I was when I first heard it. 1996, Naval Hospital Guam, in the basement working in Plant Property, loading pallets full of junk. That's how much of an effect this album had on me. Perfect catchy poppy punk that was right for the time... It's a shame it didn't do more...ThanxDavid"
2,Flat,"What's so great in this book? The characters lack profoundity, and I soon tired of them, because they were so nondescript in personality (other than glitz and glamour) that I lost all interest, given also the oblomovian lack of emotion they display whatever happens to them. As for the humour, this novel has as much fizz as a can of cola drink left open for a week. It just didn't catch."
2,wacky story of 2 L.A. friends,"This book is one crazy mishap after another! Dandy and her best friend Craig are constantly running into celebrities. Not to mention making dumb mistakes like getting stuck in Disneyland over night. It doesn't have a very deep story to it, but very funny at times. I wouldn't say it was the best storyline. If you are looking for a deeper novel pass this one over."
4,Reading a real-life soap opera,"As I live in Los Angeles and am around characters that are EXACTLY like this, I found the book to be remarkably accurate. This book is definitely ""entertaining,"" and I couldn't put it down. However, this is NOT a book to increase your brain cells, but if you want to laugh and read as though you are watching a soap opera, pick it up."
5,Where are my misadventures?,"I used to read the column in DETOUR magazine, by the fictional Craig Clybourn, upon which the novel is based. Every month found me at the newstand, waiting for read more of the misadventures faces by Craig and Dandy, and their slew of friends. I was more than surprised to find the hardback, with all the columns finally pulled together to show a great effort in fun story telling. When I lived in Los Angeles, also in the 213, everything seemed possible; it was refreshing to read a novel in which everything (and everyone) became possible. My favorite parts of the novel involved Miles and the watermelon, Claudia and the Lost Hope chest, and Godfrey and the playground. It took me one day to read the book cover to cover; I still find myself opening the book to any random chapter throughout the year, just to laugh once again. Great book, and I do wish that Dennis Hensley would take time to write another novel!"
4,Entertaining romp through Hollywood!,"This is Hollywood as seen through the eyes of young upwardly mobile gay man Craig Clybourn; an aspiring screen-writer, Craig lives vicariously through his vivacious and promiscuous college friend Dandy Rio, who has her own sitcom, and his other overly ambitious colleagues. Portrays Hollywood as the cut-throat, blood-lusting place that it is rumored to be in such a funny manner that you will want to take this one to read again and again as light entertainment on long trips or long afternoons."
3,Dennis Hensley is No Armistead Maupin,"This book definitely passes as the type of mindless reading that's nice for the beach, but does not have the charm of Armistead Maupin--to whom Hensley has been compared by some. Hensley's characters can certainly deliver the campy one-liners, but these characters are rather flat and grow tiresome quite quickly. Not far into the book, Hensley runs out of ideas of what to do with his characters and as a result he resorts to tedious plot developments that go nowhere. Maupin's gift was being able to create a fluffy serial that somehow transended its fluffiness. The magic of his writing gave his characters depth and warmth. Hensley's serial is just a serial. It will make you laugh occasionally, but don't expect more."
3,very funny,"I really liked this book. It's about a gay aspiring screenwriter in L.A. His best friend is on some teen sitcom and of course she is in her mid-twenties. They get caught up in all kinds of crazy schemes with celebrities like Ginger from Gilligan's Island and Heather Locklear. It is very funny, but twords the end it gets to be too much and you just want to finish already."
2,Did I miss the joke and Character development?,"I really like entertainment books and LA lifestyle. This one missed the mark. In fact, I kept struggling to finish it and was very happy to move on to my next book.I didn't find the jokes overtly funny although there is some that are humorous. ON the bright side, the character development of Dandy is over the top and funny. The lead character's love life is casually developed with no real conclusion. Most of the other characters are just not funny.Maybe I'm too old to get it. However, ""Word"" by Felske is a much better read of the Hollywood lifestyle. I also found ""California Screamin"" a better read than this one and it really qualifies as a gay romance novel."
5,90210 it isn't!,"This book was hilarious! If only there were a choice for more than just 5 stars! Dennis Hensley is phenomenal; I truly forgot how much I loved irreverant, flow-of-consciousness writing! Reading this book not only provided me with unending entertainment but it sent me back to a genre of books I had inexplicably stopped reading. I wish he had more books like this for me to read but I can wait, the wait is definitely worth it. If you enjoy tounge in cheek and sarcasm in your books you will not be let down. I promise!"
1,Tries but fails,"This novel reads like something a fourth grader wouldproduce. The characterisations are for the most part OK but theirdevelopment is hampered by immature dialogue and laughable situations. Some of the comedic scenes do provoke a laugh especially Dandi's escapades on Politically Incorrect with Bill Marr but generally the humour falls dreadfully flat. Maybe Hensley is really only trying to impress us with his knowledge of the local LA scene... who knows! There is also no story and the episodic structure it pretty mundane as it has all been done before. This is supposed to be a funny book which is really unfunny. Maybe it would make a better cheap, prime time sitcom. I couldn't even finish it!"
4,"""Misadventures"" would be an understatement!","This book was an incredibly entertaining read. It made me laugh out loud on several occasions. The story is about Craig, a screenwriter wannabe and his band of misfit sidekicks, TV Star Dandy, PR guy Miles and enough supporting cast members to keep you busy for at least a few hours of good reading. Did I forget to mention that Craig has just come out of the closet after a failed relationship with a woman? And he tries unsuccessfully to find the ""perfect"" relationship...over and over and over again. Hilarious story. Pick it up, you won't regret it."
4,"Great drive, bad software.","This is a USB Flash Drive with pre-loaded compression software. The compression is very slow on any computer because it uses the flash memory, which has slow access compared to the computer's own RAM, for the compression operation. The space savings for anything except plain text is not worth the time to compress it to the drive. Just delete the software and this is a good flash drive. It's thin enough to plug in next to other usb cables, and there's no cap to lose."
5,I LOVE SONY,"I love sony products because they are so durable, they can take a beating and still work perfectly. The same goes with the flash drive. The speed is great and when i accidently kicked it (dont ask) and it bent really bad but i plug it back in and it still worked. I say buy it!"
1,Sony Microvault,"i got this flash drive for my birthday in decemer and after only using it like 5 times total the thing burned out. doesnt work anymore, and the return policy from the store with the ""easy"" button may prevent me from getting a new one. unless it was just a fluke, i recommend something else."
4,Does what it says,"Trope Trainer Standard - World's Best Bar Mitzvah / Bat Mitzvah Trainer!I'm just starting to learn Torah trope. I tried the free trial version and liked it. Allows learning of multiple tropes, different Hebrew pronounciations and various voices. The trope training parallels my class. Like being able to print a specific alyiah both as written in Torah and with vowels. So I ordered the program and know I'll use it a lot.One shortcoming is not being able to export to a mp3/wav file. Will allow downloading of up to three reading in iTunes."
4,Service Good - product iffy,The voices chanting the text are a bit hard to decipher and the tone isn't good at all. But it gets the job done.The service was great. It came very quickly.
3,Haunting voice,"My favorite BoyZone singer and wanted more. Sadly, there will be no more. He had a voice like no other."
5,GREAT SINGLE !,"Stephen's first solo single is great ! His singular voice is really a delight for the ears. I already loved him in Boyzone, but now having the chance to catch all of his talents is even greater. Nice cover version of Simon and Garfunkel's hit. A ""new biginning"" will follow and I just can't wait to hear the others songs from the album. Long live Stephen !"
4,A guide that guarantees success,"I've always loved the Soul Reaver series, so when I heard a 2nd installment was going to be issued a couple of years back I was elated. But much like the original, your going to need some help if you want to minimize your frustration with Soul Reaver 2's complicated puzzles and obstacles. That is where this book comes in. Prima's guide was to the point and provided clear instructions on how to master Soul Reaver. Beautiful color illustrations, some background information of the games characters, and combat tips made Soul Reaver 2 a much more enjoyable game to play. Thegame by itself is a masterpiece with stunning graphics, great story line, and very realitic environments, Prima's Soul Reaver 2 guide enhances the magnificance of this epic game."
2,Shiny and messy,"The chrome tape is indeed shiny and chrome-y. The biggest problems are that it doesn't stick to many surfaces, and once you open the package, there's a really good chance you're going to have a giant ball of knotted chrome tape as soon as you drop it or don't tape it back together tightly. I've yet to find a surface other than glass that the stuff sticks to in my car, a Saturn Sky. On the plus side, it does look exactly as advertised, and if you can get it to stick somewhere, it'd probably look really cool."
1,"1/4"" Chrome Stripe","About 4 months ago I purchased 1/4 inch chrome that was 1/4 inch wide and about 3/32 inch thick. That chrome was very satisfactory and the reason why I purchased more of it. This product shown here is not. It is simply a roll of 1/4"" shiny aluminum color tape. If it was designated as tape I would not have purchased it."
4,A nice budget collection,"This is yet another nice collection of love songs by Elvis, for a good price. While this is a good set, there are better ones available with more songs. I would recommend you pass on this release and get the ""Love, Elvis"" CD or the two CD Elvis set ""The 50 Greatest Love Songs""."
1,Bible Trivia GARBAGE,"This book is AWFUL! Ok, I know it's a bible trivia book and I should be all ""christian"" about reviewing it...but, there is absolutely NOTHING good about this book. The author thinks they are all witty and funny and smart, and I realize it's trying to be ""fun"", but, man! It's just BAD. Don't download this book to your iPhone - it's 100% worthless! Maybe OK on a kindle. And at least if you buy it in print you can get the satisfaction of burning it."
2,Mad Doctor seeks leg to heal injured love.,"When his dancer love looses a leg in a car accident a doctor attempts limb transplants from unwilling donors. Slow moving and unoriginal suspense thriller is more soap opera than thriller, it takes forever to get moving and when it does, goes nowhere new. Only of marginal interest to NotLD fans, others should skip it."
2,This book is using very antiquated racial theories.,"I am sad to see the ""hamitic"" hypothesis is alive and well after reading the first sections of human history here, and to see the author claim that the Sumerians were ""probably caucasian in root"" (43) According to Matthew Frye Jacobson's very good book, Whiteness of a Different Color, the ""caucasian"" racial category was cooked up some time in the 1920s and has no scientific basis. The naturalizing of racial categories in this book is disappointing, and I am sad to see that a book using them received such uncritical reviews from such respected publications as The Economist and the Christian Science Monitor. As an antidote to this version of world history, I'd suggest a little Basil Davidson and Martin Bernal."
2,Tiresome,"A Short History of the World definitely has a slant to it. The author calls the French and Indian War the Seven Year War. I think it would've been easier to use the French and Indian War, afterall there's been only one French and Indian War in the history of the human race-- there's been countless wars that have lasted seven years and can be called a Seven Year War.Furthermore, he even uses outdated names for mountain ranges and countries. He mentioned a range in America that I couldn't find on a map-- I think he was referring to the Appalachians or Rockies, but I'm not sure. Plus he uses the term ""Anatolia"" instead of Asia Minor/Turkey. I've never heard ""Anatolia"" used before, but then I don't have a PhD in history.Lastly, this book is boring. Basically he says a lot about nothing. It rambles. I finally finished it after three months."
2,"Good Content, Poor Form","There is no doubt that Roberts knows his history, and he has performed admirably in reducing the epic content to some 500 pages or so, but nonetheless I found his writing style tedious and cumbersome. Robert's sentences are disjointed and liberally populated with unnecessary commas. I often had to reread a paragraph because of some parenthetical remark that seemed placed specifically to disrupt the reader's flow of logic. I also felt that his history was slightly biased in favor of Britain, inasmuch as they often appeared to be the heroes of world history, but any history is bound to be biased on some level. In the end, I think you could find a better read."
4,"Perfect Scope, Okay Narrative","I was a history buff in high school and studied culture in college. I was drawn by the author's reputation for articulate criticism. So this book taught me a great deal more than I expected about the underlying causes of historical shifts and trends. I also discovered some figures I never knew of before. Look at it as introduction to nearly everything important to important societies, that has been recorded. However on more than a few occasions the narrative became difficult to follow. I got the sense of what happened, or what was vital thematically to the era, but I sometimes could not craft a picture of what happened to the people of the time on a granular sense. Perhaps there was no way to get that from a book of such broad strokes, so that might be my fault rather than the text. Or because the author is British and I'm a New Yorker (some of the writing is very British from my view)."
3,"I bought the wrong book, but this one is decent.","I meant to buy A Little History Of The World, but accidentally bought this one instead. It's ok, very detailed and in depth for being a condensed history book. It can get a bit boring though, not as easy to read as I had hoped. Then again, I am comparing it to the book I wanted in the first place, which is intended more for children. A good read for history buffs, but not as easy to get into for casual readers."
4,Good summary of the history of people; sentence structure hard to read in places.,"When many people think of reading a book about the entire history of mankind, many would think the book would be heavy, hard-to-read, and boring. This book is none of those things. The writing is almost conversational and moves along quickly. The range of information and effort to touch on events around the world is commendable.My one ""negative"" is that I struggled now and then with the sentence structure of the writing in some places. I am not sure if it was a problem with the editing or if it was written in a style which did not ""flow"" for me, but I found that I had to re-read sentences occassionally to ""make sense"" of them."
2,Unreadable...,"I was looking for a good overview of world history and many raved about this Oxford professor's one-volume ""History of the World."" Problem is, even for a reasonably educated person like myself (I have an advanced degree), Professor Roberts' writing style was so cumbersome, tortured, and convoluted that I had to re-read passages several times. Occasionally, passages still made no sense, or were so vague as to be equivical, after re-readings. I'm sure Professor Roberts was a good teacher and knew a lot. But none of this amounts to a hill of beans because his writing is so terrible. A much better one-volume history, in my view, is William McNeill's handbook on the History of Western Civilization (although its emphasis is on the West)."
2,don't like it,"I'm really confused as to why amazon keeps recommending me books for a middle school age reading level!With the plot this story could have been really good. Sunny gets a letter from her dead sister Jaz saying she was coming home sunday. When ""Jaz"" gets there Dad and Sunny realize it's not Jaz, in fact she could be a dangerous criminal.I'm not quite sure why this book was written at such a low reading level. But I will say it definatly shouldn't be in the teen section of the library."
2,WTF?,"kk my FAVORITE book ever was ""Shattering Glass"" by Gail Giles. The same author wrote this book, so I thought it would be pretty good.Although, I soon found differently. The story jumps right in, and is at a really low reading level. The main character's sister died in a tragic fire. Or so it seems. When she recieves a letter from her sister (in the first 2 pages), she is upsetted, and does not want her sister to be alive.But when Jazz shows up at the door, Sunny believes that this is not really her sister at all, but that maybe Jazz had hired somebody else to impersonate her.Well, my thought is this: wtf, wat kind of person wouldn't know if someone were her sister or not? wow, this book is so unbelievable, definently for people from ages 10-12 maybe."
3,Unbelievable!,"From the title you could tell someone has died. Jasmine the older child in a family of two has been assumed dead. The apartment she was living in burnt to a crisp and know one has heard from her. Sunny her sister is the narrator of this book and right away you the reader knows that Jasmine was the apple of her family eye. A father who is an alcoholic and a mother who is manic leaves Sunny to take care of herself. One day while returning home from school she goes into the mailbox and low and behold there is a letter from her dead sister, but is it really from her? This book had me wanting more from page to page. I did not want to put it down. The conclusion of this book left a lot to be desired. I felt the author robbed her audience of a proper conclusion good read though."
2,a confusing disappointment,"I was very impressed with Shattering Glass and had looked forward to DGDWL, but after having read the ending three times, I just don't understand what happened. The end was more confusing than subtly suggestive/mysterious. The mystery's ""solution"" seemed tacked on and implausible - even within the realm of the fantastic. And...unless I missed something...who *is* Karen?Maybe Giles will do better next time...."
2,Disappointment from a Good Author,"Okay, there are twists (and I won't give them away), but this story is very familiar and the story never rises above mediocre. It might be good to a reader 12 or under, but any high school student will read it with cynicism and disbelief. Giles' other works are high quality - Shattering Glass is a favorite - but this one just seemed flat. You might feel sorry for the narrator, Sunny, but you won't buy into her story."
1,Buy Standard Deviants,"This is Same as the following DVD and the price is so cheaperStandard Deviants School - Basic Math, Program 8 - Adding & Subtracting Fractions (Classroom Edition) (2004)"
4,I Love the Old School,If you love the back in the day you'll love this Cd I really think its Great and you should enjoy it too
3,Standard TV Documentary,"This is a well done, yet generic television documentary and good if you're interested in Malcolm X's public life. It seems their idea of an 'intimate portrait' was based more upon his life in the press and how others viewed him. At times it seems to border on the sensationalistic, but only goes so far (probably because of the Dan Rather element). There are some interesting interviews, but they never linger too long on the personal. More time is given to the conflict Malcolm X experienced with the Nation of Islam, how people reacted to or regarded him, the controversy surrounding him, and some questions are raised regarding the conspiracy of his assassination. It is interesting for historical and political purposes and the interviews with current Afro-American figures such as James Farmer, Maya Angelou, Public Enemy, Malcolm Jamal-Warner, and Wesley Snipes are insightful, but don't count on a truly 'intimate portrait'."
3,This is the CBS documentary,"Dan Rather hosts a riveting and revealing odyssey that traces the life and times of the most charismatic and controversial leader of the Civil Rights Movement. Also includes interviews with many who knew him including his widow Betty Shabazz, Quincy Jones, Dick Gregory, Andrew Young, and contemporary artists like Public Enemy, who discuss his legacy."
5,Very good music!,"i love these 2 tapes; unfortunately, my first one tore up. guess i gotta get a new one. these tapes are also good for dirty dancing! loved the tapes!"
1,terrible bug spray smell!,"I love lemon verbena soap/lotion that I have purchased from places such as Evelyn & Crabtree. This however, is absolutely awful smelling - and actually gave me a sick feeling. The lemon note is pure citronella: what you get in natural bug repellant. I wanted to return the item, but the seller makes it difficult and charges a 15% restocking fee. It took an exceptionally long time to receive this item, to the point I wondered if there was a problem. How excited I was to finally get it, only discover the rank oder on the first spritz. I had to use alcohol and Lava soap to remove it, due to its gut-wrenching strength. Before my attempts to scrub it off, I waited for the verbena or lavender dry down it described, and it never went, after half an hour, to anything soft or pleasing. What a waste of money, time, and hopes. Avoid this one at all cost. I don't even want to use it as a bug spray, Cutter and Natural Off smells better than this."
2,Was just OK,I read so many great reviews about this product so I was extremely disappointed that it smelled so much like baby powder. I won't be buying this again.
3,defective West Wing Disc,I have been a fan of West Wing since it's first show. I have ordered the first four seasons and several of the discs will 'stick' or are in some way defective. I'm not sure of my next move.Alice Rosenberg
2,Not enough support,"In haste, I bought the first keyboard wrist pad under $10 I could find here on amazon.com figuring ""they are all the same"" but to my disappoint, they are not. This Kensington wrist pillow looks like its built for good construction, but the foam used inside does not support (push back)against my wrist as much as I need it to. At first it feels like it does, but over hour, my wrists sink down into it and the support feels just as if I've used this pad for YEARS when in actually I've only used it 20 mins! My work around is it repeatedly flip the pad around, sort of like rotating your car tires, to rest my wrists on a another section of the the pad, but I feel you shouldn't have to do that with a product. For the same price, keep shopping and you will find one that does the job."
2,not as pictured,"this wrist guard is OK, but it's NOT as pictured and it's a bit too small and not that great. annoying."
2,Not worth [the price],"I was VERY disappointed with this gem-care book. It has nice pictures, but contains very little information about gem-care that isn't obvious already. The book does not address any of the more unusual gems and stones either. Do not buy this book! It's a waste of [money]."
5,a masterpiece of electronica,everything he touches is gold. ego-trip is probably his best work (inevitable alien nation is very close). his eclectic sound crosses many genre categories but it is pure electronica. a must have for any fan of eletronica!
3,Not Keoki's Greatest,"This might be an Ego Trip, but it's also a bad trip. It makes it hard to kick back and relax. I know people like to dance to this type of music too, but it may not be worth the energy. There are however a few decent parts on the album, like some of Majick, and parts of Space. Even so, I would steer clear of this and get something better."
2,Totally Disenchanted and Disappointed,"I only read true crime stories; I am still in the process of reading this book and have to force myself NOT to put it somewhere and go on to another one. I feel that the author did not tell the story as in the fashion of other good authors. There are incomplete sentences that make one have to reread the sentence to get the jist of that emotion. I, for one, feel that this book is not anywhere near or close to the other crime stories that I read. I would have to read another book by Miss Chew before giving a true explanation of her work. I have read the other reviews which tend to say the opposite of what I say but people are different. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone that I know."
1,onesided,the facts in this book are very one sided.....coming basically from one of the criminals. To get the full effect of the whole scenario.....more detailed and true searching would have made this a better book. The story telling isnt done as acurately as it could've been. Some events were told out of sequence as well.
1,If you want to read A Fatal Lie then read this book!,"How can Sally Chew write a supposedly true story when she has admitted at her book review that she has never spoken to Stacey's mother, friends or boyfriend? This whole book came from the killer's point of view and not the victim. There is one killer still on the lose who contributed to this book!"
4,It was interesting..,"It was a really interesting story... kind of haunting. It's amazing to know the truth behind stories like that.. it's almost unreal how evil people can really be. But the author covered it well, and it was a good book."
3,Too many people,This book has so many characters that it is difficult to keep up with who is doing what with who and where. You really don't get to know each one very well. There were so many more people than just the four girls and victim involved.
4,Great for an SPD fan!,My son rec'd this as a gift and he loves it because he can immitate the power rangers.
1,No judgement!!!,"When my son got this toy (he is 10), he thought it would have 2 lights in judgement mode: one being guilty and one being innocent. Well ,it didn't! All it does is it has a voice that says judgement time. I do not recommend this toy!"
5,Great Song!!,"Not only is this a great song in relation to the events on Sept. 11th, it is a great holiday song with great lyrics, for all times. We have so much to be grateful for at holiday times AND so much to be grateful as Americans. What a wonderful melody and lyrics to reflect on.This song will be a part of my holiday collection, this year and every year."
5,Easy enough for 3 year old,"I purchased this for my son's 3rd Birthday, he loves all things Diego. I wondered if I didn't jump the gun a bit though since everything seems to be geared for 4 years old and up. He loves it, there are arrows to guide him and the ""quests"" are simple for him. It's a bit hit and he loves it."
5,Great game when compared to others Leapster games we have,"My daughter loves Diego, so that helps a lot. She is a bit young for the game, but she has been playing it more lately. We've had it for about two months. There are very basic games that have the player just search around for shapes or numbers before the player can move on (through a doorway) to the next puzzle. I believe there are three main missins that each have three levels and I think there are a few minigames as well. I played it for a bit, so I could understand what was going on and help my daughter figure it out. I did become bored rather quickly picking up food boxes. Still, I think it is a great overall game and is much better than the Little Mermaid or the default games that come with the unit."
4,Go Diego Go Leapster Game,My child loves this show and took to this game right away. I am surprised how he manipulates the buttons on his leapster so rapidly when he has just turned four!
1,"I never got it, Fedex can't find it.","I never got it. Fedex can't find it. They have put a tracer on it, but no luck so far."
2,Will Not Work in a Leapster Explorer Despite..............,"I did a search for ""Leapster Explorer Diego"" and this popped up so I purchased it. When I gave it to my daughter and she opened it up, it would not fit. I guess I should have not trusted the ""search"" and read the fine print. Now I have to pay for shipping to return it since it was my error according to Amazon."
3,So-so,"I love Mike Venezia's books. Maybe due to complexity of the subject and personality of the artist the author had troubles finding the right presentation. Unfortunately, not the best book from the series."
2,"More Like ""Techno Mix **'94**""","This CD Is Great for those who haven't heard of or don't really listen to Techno very often. The ""Mix"" of songs take you through the early days of 90's Techno but ironically this CD has almost nothing to do with ""Techno"" dating past 1995. Even the title itself is redundant: Raves-(a now trendy term) characteristically go on ""All Nite"" anyway...or else they'd just be House Parties. Buy this CD if you you're looking for out-of-print singles like ""Speed"" and ""Bombscare"" otherwise take your money and go to a real ""Rave""..."
3,techno is da bomb!,"Ahh, this is an okay cd if you like anything techno, I think its kinda different from most of what I listen to like Brooklyn Bounce, but it's still good!"
2,94 back again?,"This CD, while having the redeeming quality of the Speed track, is old school and quite lame. If buying this CD expect to be stuck in 1995."
4,Electronic vibes,I heard this group on Groove Salad/Soma FM and had to get theirmusic. This album goes from deep electronic to soft soothing vibes. Lots of good dance music.
5,Perfect,This pillow arrived looking just like the picture - it complemented my other Rose Tree Symphony pillows and bedspread very well.
3,new,this was the first time I have used it but it did not work to good for me it did not have a taste and it did not hold like I was hoping but nothing else has held my teeth in either but it may work good for you it is worth a try
2,DenTek,"I would prefer that the manufacturer was honest about the product.I purchased this product from Amazon.com because I associated there name with honesty and quality. Guess I was wrong.They advertised there product would last better than the leading brands.Well, it doesn't.As a matter of fact, it lasted as long as any name brand I have used.In addition. The product has tiny hard particles in it.This feels like sand particles in your mouth.If I drink coffee, the product dissolves in a short time."
3,Didn't last a full 24 hours.,Secure was a good product.. But didn't last a full 24 hours. Really pretty much the same as polident. Just a little harder to clean off the dentures at the end of the day.. I was willing to give Secure a try. Will save money and just go to my nearest drug store and stick with the polident.
4,best yet,"being new to bottom dentures , i did't find any thing on the market that worked very well . i found secure on the internet . out of everything i tried , secure works the best ! it's not quite as good as advertised . it will not last 12 hr. but then neither did anything else . i just wish i could buy it locally ."
2,Not so good?,There was only one review available on this product when I ordered it. The person that uses the product reported that compared to the more mainstream products this one was not as good. The place were I purchased it is very good and the merchant did everything in his power to deliver it in good condition. So the rating goes to the product itself not the seller. I will not purchase again and I should have known better after reading only one review. The law of average really counts when it comes to reviews. 2 Stars.
1,A waste of money,Doesn't work any better than any other denture adhesive and I've used them all. I used it on a partial lower denture and it held for about an hour.
1,Tastes like epoxy,Did not like this product at all. Did not hold as well as other denture adhesives and left a horrible epoxy taste in my mouth.
1,Lasts only a few hours and oozes,Was hoping this would work as described. I followed instructions and the product oozed out from beneath upper and lower plates. I only lasted approx 4 hours before I had to reapply. I do not relish having to eat this product. I am disappointed.
3,"sometimes good, sometimes poor","Well, I got this on line from the secure web site. When I first used it, it worked so well that I got rid of the Fixodent that I was using. However, I must caution anyone with soft denture relines or that use drug store type temporary soft relines, the cream doesn't last very long. I read this caution only after I had bought it. The cream may last for one meal tops when I have the soft temporary reline type wedges(that's the best way I can describe them) I really do wish this adhesive worked better than Fixodent or Polident, but it really doesn't most of the time for me. I'm still looking for a good adhesive that will actually work all day long. Another problem (for me anyway)When I put the dentures in with the adhesive, there is a bad burning sensation with my gums. the company says that's normal. I don't' like it and I doubt I'll buy any more of this product since it's more expensive and not any better than what I was using."
3,Not as good as I had hoped it would be.,"I was hoping for a product for my lower denture that would last all through a business day, breakfast, lunch and dinner and maybe then some. Although Secure is slightly better than Fixodent which I had been using, by dinner time I find I must re-apply more denture cream if I want to get through a third meal. I'm often out on business all day and needless to say this is very inconvienient. Why can't they make a denture cream that really holds tight like glue and requires a lot of effort to break it loose? I think I'll stick to Fixodent; Secure is not worth the extra cost.."
1,Did not ilke the product at all.,"I tried the product 8 times, did everything it said to do. My dentures would not stay in place for even 5 mins. Very disappointing."
3,Dentek Secure Dental Adhesived,"Secure works about as well as the brands I can buy, over the counter without paying shipping charges. None of them work to ""hold all day"" as advertised and Secure is no different."
2,Wasn't quite as good as represented in ad.,Didn't work any better than Freedent which I continue to use. One of the main facators was it had a horrid burning sensation and I can do with out that. The hold was the other factor. It didn't work for me.
4,Better than the ones at the stores.,"I love this adhesive. It doesnt goop up as long as you spread it. Even with a thin layer of it will stick the dentures to your gums all day long.I have used poligrip, polident, fixodent, and thank god for Amazon, if it wasnt for this website I wouldn't have known any better product was out there.Dont understand why they dont sell it in stores.Very good product."
1,Not What I really expected,"This stuff doesn't work any better than fixodent, I would have sent it back but didn't want to spend any extra money on shipping it back."
2,don't waste your money,"After reading the reviews, I was anxious to try this product. The claim is that it lasts up to 12 hours. In reality, it lasted from one meal to the next, had to be reapplied often. Don't waste your money."
4,Secure works!,I was a little hesitant at first as I'm really struggling with securing my lower denture and have tried every product on the market. The only thing that works somewhat for me is Polygrip...but only holds for a few hours and I am VERY limited on what I can eat. With Secure it holds for at least 5-6 hours for me (which is WAY better than what I've had) and I can eat a few more foods with confidence. It's still not perfect but MUCH better than any other product. I just wish it was sold in stores :-(
4,Pretty good!,"It is much better than fixodent or the other kinds you can buy at the drugstore. Still not perfect! My dentures still came lose, but it took a little longer."
4,Works,"Secure works very well, best I have found so far, just a small amount is enough to last all day"
2,I had high hopes,"I really wanted to love this stuff. When first applied it felt great, but the hold didn't last any longer then Fixodent. The worst part is it leaves a film on my dentures that I have to literally scrape off, because of that I keep it as an emergency stash. I still love the initial hold and could deal with the film if that hold lasted longer then an hour."
2,DENTEK DENTURE BONDING CREAM,"In my search to find a better denture adhesive, I decided to try this one. It did not provide the stability and/or security of my other adhesive which was EFFERGRIP."
3,Not as good as Fixodent,"I have to agree with another comment I read concerning how long the secure denture adhesive lasts, it does NOT last anywhere near as long as Fixodent. I'm trying to find a good adhesive without zinc, I do not care for zinc free poligrip. I will stick with the secure for a while, as I've purchased 2 tubes anyway, it seems to be a pretty good product and for me it lasts around 8 hours, compared to 12+ hours with the Fixodent. I'll guess I'll just have to use adhesive more often than I've been used to."
5,One of the best CD I've heard!,"Great CD. One of the best audio recording I have listened. Music is pleasant and soothing, even without my understanding of the language. Definitely recommended for anyone who wants a CD which can be used as a reference for good well recorded music."
5,great necklace!!!,"I got my necklace fast, it had a great price, and is very good quality. I reccomend this to everyone that is looking for a good necklace."
2,small and tarnished,"I've had this product for less than a year, it is not the best quality and has tarnished. The chain is microscopic and not worth $35. I would not recommend it."
3,Ehh,"Seems like the quality's fine, but I didn't realize it was only going to be like a millimeter thick. The picture makes it look thicker."
4,"Nice, but a little thinner then I expected","The necklace didn't look as thin in the picture, but my bf liked it so that's all that mattered! The cut was nice, and it made his old pendent look dull Because it was so shiny"
3,"Nice,ButToShinyToSmall","i knew it was going to be small,but this is kinda crazy how small it is,And its crazy shiny too,You really can see it across the room,that doesnt mean its a bad thing,i wish it was twice the thikness and a size 26inch,im still going to keep my chain and wear it,Because it is still a nice chain,it was worth the money i paid,but if i paid a cent more then i did,I Would be one Mad Dude!"
1,Cheap!,It broke after wearing it for one day.It Was thinner than I thought it would be .I will be seeking a refund
1,"Nice Chain, Poor Quality","I recieved this chain on Wednesday, by Monday it was broken. It is a nice looking chain, but I was worried about the quality as soon as I took it out of the pouch it came in. Sending it back and looking for something different."
3,"Can't say why this is a chain for ""men""","I just wanted something strong to keep my 16GB ""Corsair Survivor"" USB around my neck.I decided to get this and I will use it because of the two chains I got here on Amazon this one seems to be less obvious and also seems to be very strong for its size. (I uploaded an image so that you could get an idea of its actual size)I dropped 1 star because it does pretty expensive. Looks more like a $20 - $25 chain.PS: Here is a link to the other more ""manly"" chain I decided to get (also uploaded images of it)... but it looks more like a ""teenager"" chain:Men's Stainless Steel Chain Necklace, 22"""
2,Not what I thought it would be,"This chain is much smaller than I thought it would be. It was too small and feminine for a man. Also, the clasp is very hard to open. I was dissappointed in this chain."
1,Poor Quality,Purchased this chain for my 16 year old son. It broke with-in the month. It cost me almost $20 to repair. Pay the extra for a box chain.
1,Warning!!,I received a empty package with just a blue pouch! What kind of business is this!! They still haven't returned my emails to resolve the problem!!
2,"Pretty chain, but delicate looking and the clasp is awful","This chain is pretty, but the clasp makes it not worth the money or effort. My fingers do not have the nimbleness needed to use this rather tiny clasp. Forget about purchasing the product, it's not worth the problems associated with the clasp."
4,Awesome game,"The game is excellet - the kind of great game that sadly does not sell as well as it should just because it's not mainstream. Lacking to get 5 stars is some better layout (some text is unreadable because it overlaps images), but I still very much recommend the game - if you like anything steampunk, victorian or just want a different roleplaying game - make sure this one is in your collection."
5,"Wonderful for children, parents and grandparents.","We have all enjoyed this CD, it's music and coloring pages.We are glad to offer it to our grandchildren instead of the noisy music and nonsense lyrics that are so much in vogue these days.Thank you!"
3,"ok product, good price",This cd is okay for a toddler. There are some really great and upbeat songs that my daughter loves and some we just skip through. For the price it's recommendable and the songs are all very positive for children.
3,Not that impressed,The music was not as cheerful as wee would have like it. My child is use to more upbeat music
2,"monotone, no variations","These songs are all sung by a group of children. so it's kind of monotone. some of the songs' lyrics are not original. My 3yrs old son usually loves music (that's why i bought this CD) but with this CD he didn't pay attention to any of the songs.To me kid's music need to be more fun, and the artist & music got to be varied to capture kids' attention. don't see it in this CD."
4,Can't beat the price,"The least expensive one out there, but definitely a better choice than some of the more expensive options. A good starter cd to see if your toddler likes it!"
4,18 month old Granddaughter likes it,"Travelling with my 18 month old Granddaughter hasn't always been fun in the past. Then I found this toddle CD on Amazon. I find that she likes the music. She doesn't know all of the songs or words but,it does keep her occupied while I keep my eyes on the road!"
2,Didn't realize this was a religious CD,My husband and I are Christian and plan to raise our daughter as Christian but I really don't want her listing to songs about Jesus dying on the cross for us. We wanted something fun and upbeat for her to dance to and this is just a bummer.
3,1 problem,Works OK. Easy to assemble and works well. One BIG problem is setting control which does not firmly hold setting. Very easy to inadvertently change the application rate in the process of turning on.
1,Shipping box inappropriate,"Unit was shipped in a cardboard box, much larger then the unit. Banging during shipment, the body arrived cracked, and the bag with the small parts and screws lost most of its content."
1,It sucks,"Seed only came out reliably when the regulator is fully open. At lower settings the seed will stop coming out for a few seconds, then start again (sometimes), then stop.Other problem is after using for about 30 minutes the wheel got so tight it stopped spinning and was just skidding along the ground, so the seed spinner would not turn.Completely useless waste of money."
5,My daily guidebook,"I use this amazing little book daily as a guidebook for my life. It helps me through every type of situation I face or may face. It's a step by step practical process that is easy to read and understand. The application is up to me! Of all the spiritual power tools, Meditation and the Seven Steps for Successful Life Transitions are the two I have used most. Both are key to helping me change my consciousness. Meditation is the foundation and the Seven Steps help me release any person, place, emotion or idea that limits me from my greater good. I am moving out of state and the Seven Step process is helping me make this important change in my life. I definitely recommend this handbook to help you navigate and live your best life. You deserve it!"
2,Dont buy used cds online.,"Nothing against the seller, but used old and rare cds are best bought new. If you cant then used is the way to go, but these both scratched mid way through the set. Wasnt a lot of cash so no harm no foul."
4,"Great, classic CD","Ahh, yes, the good old days of raving in Los Angeles is the mid 90's. John Kelley was one of my favorite djs back then because he was the only guy around who was playing breaks. And damn, he played some sick breaks for back then. I still think this CD is awesome, even though the mixing and beat matching are a bit sloppy (although this is an indication that this was actully mixed with turntables and not created in pro tools like so many of today's mixes, which is cool). John Kelley may not be the best DJ ever but I love this CD; especially the first track by Uberzone, and ""Everybody Thinks I'm High"". Classic!"
4,Desert Soul,"While some of these tracks may sound a little old for a few of us, Kelly's mixing is impecabble and there are some genuinely jump-up-and-party tracks on here. Perhaps the pioneering effort of the Funky Breaks sound, this mix is one of the best."
4,2nd Birthday fun,We bought our daughter a KidKraft kitchen for her Birthday so of course we wanted all the cute KidKraft things to go with it!!! We love this set it is very sturdy and the colors are perfect for a little girl!!! She has sooo much fun playing with it. It does not make any noises which is good and bad. But none the less we love it and are looking forward to playing with it for years to come! It will last forever!!! That is the quality you can only get with KidKfraft!!
3,Take what you can get,"If you are a Jellyfish fan then you need this CD in your collection. Roger's voice is great, but I think he's trying to sound like a child when he sings, really. There are some good songs, and some ""eh"" songs, and a few I've tried to like but just never won me over. With the exception of 2-3 songs, this CD is mostly novelty music. But to Roger's credit, his song writing and vocal arrangements are genius, even when he's being cheesy.If you want more power with your pop get a Jason Falkner CD."
4,Solid,"A lab experiment gone right where the dna of Andrew Gold is centrifuged with Karen Carpenter.""Imagination"" is well-crafted bubblegum pop at its finest. Mind you, I'm not going to spin this up when I have the guys over for college football on tv, but...well done, Roger.So, Roger and Jason put out very serviceable solo material - Andy's still in self-imposed exile. I think Chris is in Cirque du Soleil somehwere.Oh for fark's sake, Roger - 14 years later, the market is finally ready for a Jellyfish album. Let Jason co-write a few songs and he'll shut up. Hell, I'll even sit in the studio and administer occasional beatings in case tensions flare between you and Andy. I'm not a big guy, but I'm sure I could take all of you. You're small."
1,Please take the time to read it.,"Song writing - 5 stars all the way Roger never a doubt.Here is the thing and it's just one mans opinion. You don't have a strong enough voice to sing lead vocals. Your strength in harmony is undeniable, your strength in song writing is undeniable, your skill as a musician is second to none. You just don't have what is needed to fill the role of lead vocalist. That is the only thing that will keep this release from the ears of all who unfortunately will never get to appreciate it."
5,Great Value,"This compilation is a great value containing two discs of original hits. The songs aren't necessarily what teams would want to warm up to; instead, the songs are good ""upbeat"" numbers to play during a game to get fans excited."
1,Mary disappointing,"When I read the desription of this item, I ordered it right away, only to be disappointed when I received it. The Bookmark is nothing as it is desribed in the details. The description is very misleading. Maybe this is an idea gift for a child, and not the adult book lover."
5,great non-bib bib,"This is easy to put on my often squirmy toddler son for breakfast so that we can now go to school with clean clothes! the pictures of cats and dogs make it even more appealing and it gets the job done, is easy to clean, etc."
1,"Doesn't pick up food, easy to pull off, hard to clean","I bought this bib after a lot of recommendations. I was very disappointed. First, the pocket is pretty much useless. It clings to the bib itself and doesn't catch half the food... even when it does, it's hard to get it out. It makes it very hard to clean these bibs sort of putting them in the laundry. Plus I used dish soap and let them dry out for a long time but one of the bib started to have black mold stains, and even cleaned that way they end up stinking after a day. Then, even with the little sleeves, my 16 month old managed to pull it off right away, so unless you can watch your kid like a hawk when he's eating, I'd look elsewhere."
3,serves it's purpose,"coverage is excellent, the pocket is sewn in two halves- catches things great. i bought it because it doesn't have any of the gross effects of regular plastic- it's not cloth, but it's not plastic. i'm not overly thrilled with it, but i haven't been disappointed yet, so it serves the purpose and helps me take better care of my childs clothes and health"
5,Thankful for this Song!,"I consider myself romantic for a man, but this book opened my eyes to aspects of romantic love I had never seen or had forgotten. I know I sometimes focus on my work too much, but Solomon's Song of Love makes me want to slow down - not just to smell the roses, but to buy them for my wife more often! Thanks, Craig, for this Song!!"
5,An Inspirational Book Guaranteed to Touch Your Life!,"No matter what your religious denomination, this book is a must read for anyone who has been, currently is, or is trying to find that elusive thing we call love. Dr. Glickman weaves stories from his own life, spanning back to childhood, together with a passage-by-passage interpretation of the Song of Solomon, in clear and concise language that unravels the mystery that is the Song of Solomon. In a wonderful blend of historical facts, personal interpretation, and soul-touching stories from his own life, the author brings to life a portion of the bible that is both beautiful and inspirational. I can not recommend this book enough for anyone who wishes to enrich their world with this life (and love) affirming book. A perfect gift for a lover, friend, family member or someone you know who needs a bit of warmeth and love brought into their hearts!"
3,Romantic stuff,It is a fine interpretation of the Songs. I was looking for a little bit more of spirituality in it which I didn't find.
1,DON'T BUY THIS CD!!!,This is 2CD's with 50 SHORTENED-TO-90-SECONDS SONGS of Raymond Lefevre per CD. To my opinion it's unethical to sell this CD's at such an high price AND without informing possible buyers of the facts. DON'T BUY IT!!
3,"Beautiful, fun, classic Jewish music for the generations.","To Life! is a wonderful way to share Jewish cultural music with your children, family and friends. It has everything from rousing Chanukah songs to deeply spiritual songs like Avenu Malkeinu (my favorite) to Hava Nagila. Our five-year-old daughter already knows all the words, and we're sure to be listening throughout the year and for many years to come."
5,Despite Everything is the best,"I've been reading Cometbus for years because my brother, Bobby Madness (of ""Tom Teenager"" fame), had his artwork featured in a couple of the zines. I was hooked from the first read! I'd grown up reading R. Crumb comics, so this was a natural progression for me. The writing flowed, the comics were excellent and everything was spot-on for the time and place (Berkeley, CA).I'd go visit my brother, Bobby, in Berkeley in those days when the punk scene was full tilt and he was doing stuff for Aaron and Cometbus. It was a strange scene up there in those days but fun at the same time; I have the photos to prove it.Buy this book to relive it or get a feel for what it was like. The artwork is top-notch stuff from some overlooked underground artists and Aaron's writing is outstanding. It's an enjoyable read down memory lane!!"
4,Like a vacation from your easy chair,"I originally bought this because I had heard about Aaron Cometbus and wanted to learn more about his life and 'zine. I really enjoyed the stories about his travels by Greyhound Bus. I wish I had figured out his method when I was younger and single! (That is the sound of envy.)This will give you a good picture of punk life in California of a few years ago, so it makes a good sociological snapshot as well as travel book. Good stories, good comics, well worth the money.I liked this book."
1,THIS IS A SUPPLEMENT NOT THE REAL BOOK!!!,"At least three of the Amazon listings for this book, including this one, fail to mention that it is only a supplement or appendix. The ""look-inside"" feature shows the real book. Don't waste your time. You will find yourself filing for a refund."
1,Damaged,They were damaged when I got them. But I threw away the box they were SHIPPED in so the company refused to take back. These could have been shipped back in 9X12 envelope. First time ever I have given negative feedback. I won't do business with this company again. I feel like I got screwed.
5,best set,This set is so cool. i got it for my birthday. this set lets you build a door that is hard for the enamy to get past. and all the walls and things let you build really cool fortresses. buy this set.
5,Another Winner!,"If you read my other review of the Heroscape components, you know this is the answer for those 13 year olds spending too much time playing computer/electronic games. Truly a worthy game and extremely well made."
4,Great Wall of ...Heroscape,"We've gotten one of these for all of my boys. We thought they would be fine with only one having a wall, but they all were so jealous they all had to have one. Sometimes thats all they play with and skip most of the other game tiles/terrain pieces. They love creating different ways to construct it. It is also larger than we thought. Awesome expansion!"
4,Castle creation and you will need more than one set!!!,"When I got this set, it's nice for me and my son to build the small castle to combine with our heroscape collection; however, we found out, one set isn't enough. You will need more than 3 sets to create a huge castle for 1000 points army game (Well, we have 5 sets). It's just like lego, you can combine all pieces to bulid up the castle and increase. It looks awesome for us to set up scenarios such as orc vs human with castle attacking and defense. We had fun with it. The worse thing for this set is ""QUALITY"". Some pieces aren't easy and smooth for you to combine together and split them out. In addition, it will start to loose after using certain times."
5,Just simply the best expansion for the money,"It doesn't come with any armies, but for as many pieces as you get for 20 dollars, this is just simply too good to pass up. I plan on buying another one so that i can play capture the flag with each side having its own fortress. The customizing of the fortress is amazing, and you have infinite choices of how to build it. If you can't build the castle you want then you just lack imagination or heroscape building skill. Very cool."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the negative portrayal of the children and the teacher in all the pictures. Each page contained a picture of the same boy with his finger stuck up his nose along with various other bad behavior from students. The teacher's expressions clearly showed her lack of control. This book was not a positive portrayal of kindergarten.
2,Mostly a good book,"Someone had torn a page out of the book. It was a page with picture on bot sides, not a good idea being that was a big part of this book."
1,Will not tighten--don't buy,"I've tried using a slightly different model (635-011) of this on two different occasions. The blade simply will not seat securely and tighten enough into the handle to work. Trying to tighten an Andersen door handle was an exercise of frustration. I could not get this screwdriver to hold--the handle would turn, while the blade would not. Waste of money."
3,RE-review,"Wow, I really got slammed by people who gave this book five stars. Just for the record, I also have devoted 100% of my life, time and attention to my son because I too have the financial means and desire to do so. My point in my original review was that this book was too confusing and there is contradictory information. I have studied very much on the subject and there's no doubt that some of the theories are correct. For example, I agree with the vaccine problem issue. But in our case, the antibiotic issue doesn't hold water because he's never used antibiotics except for a couple of times. Also, some of the treatments are good, but there are better books out there which explain this in a less confusing and frightening manner. Also, the author DOES try to get you to send all blood tests to his lab. :)"
1,Horribly organized and pointless,"I had to buy this book for an obligatory masters course. I have kept most of my textbooks, but this one was awful! It is so horribly organized. It rambles in such a way that it is impossible to understand what the author's point is and where the topic is heading. Useful kindling, at best."
1,Performed nicely...at first,"This was exactly what I was looking for. Pattern was nice from :mist, jet, and flood, then it broke. The plastic threads inside broke, and it was completely unusable for me. I returned it. Too bad, because I really liked it."
1,Poor Design,"It's awfully hard to find anything to dislike about this nozzle. That is, until you leave it attached to the threaded brass coupling seemingly found on every garden hose. I found that three weeks was all that was needed for the nozzle's aluminum coupling to forever fuse to the garden hose's brass coupling. Result? The nozzle is now junk and the new garden hose needs a coupling repair kit. I don't understand Nelson's (Goodyear's, et al) logic unless it was the few pennies they saved by using the cheaper aluminum instead of brass. Accountant-driven engineering apparently in play here."
1,Another inferior product,"If you need a nozzle that lasts only one season, this is a good choice. It looks heavy duty, but it is not. It now leaks, dripping water all over me and it has only a few spray patters, all of which I can't use on my plants."
1,Unbelievable!!,"If you replaced the word ""Islam"" with Christianity or Judaism, well, let's just say I doubt this item would be on your website. I was looking up information and items on Islam, of which you have some good ones, only to come across this hateful, bigoted bumper sticker. Truly shameful. Please take this off your website. I have to seriously consider taking my money, earned by my Moslem husband, elsewhere."
5,"Laughed Til I Cried, Then Laughed Some More!","What a wonderful book! This one had something for everyone. The lovers of romance, those in search of a good laugh (and believe me, when you read this one, get ready to roll on the floor).What more can I say,it was a wonderful book, just wonderful! I'm going right now to order her new book: Distant Memories! I can't wait!"
5,Very Entertaining and extremely hard to put down!!!,This was one of the best romance novels I have read. The story of Gavin and Summer was one that we all could hope to have. They are truly made for each other. Can't wait for the sequal.
3,Loose-Ends,"I found this book to be very interesting and enjoyable, however the conclusion ended too abruptly. I felt that 1) there should have been more to the story on Nicholas as a single father with an infant to care for, 2) more details should have been expressed about the cottage and its hidden treasures, and 3)I feel that the readers were left hanging as to Summer and Gavin relationship. I would like to see a continuation of this story as there were so many loose ends."
3,Meh.,"The first time I listened to this album, it pretty much bored my pants off. All the songs sounded the same, I couldn't really tell when one song ended and another began.After a few days I decided to try it again, since a lot of CDs sound much better the second time around. Well, this wasn't one of them. After you've heard one song, you've heard them all, really. Like another reviewer said-- Sabine's voice is nice, but she doesn't have a very large range. Even the lyrics to the songs are similar..It might sound like I'm bashing Edenbridge here, but I'm not. This isn't a bad album. It's got some nice melodies, and a really angelic/dream-like atmosphere, and of course it's better than anything playing on the radio these days. But it's just not something you can expect to listen to over and over without getting bored."
2,really like disc 2,"I really like the mad, trance feel of this techno mix on disc 2. While disc 1 is a sadistic torture akin to some crazy German techno song that repeats the word ""dildo"" every beat in every measure, disc 2 induces one to just spaz out to a true mix of an odd collection of techno. I can see how its kinda awkward but not so much. Prolly the chap uses not-ready-to-be-mixed songs, and techno songs on vinyl at that - not some drawn out, trance computer file. And have you thought of odd-time signatures? he probably uses them here. Anyways, the set has a nice tribal evolution like some fantastic hula luau of hallucinogenic fire and tiki gods demanding your reverence.I gave it a 2 cuz disc 1 is just aweful and disc 2 is great so it averages out."
1,Out of focus garbage.,"I bought this book as a gift for my boss's wife as she is an avid gardener and photographer. I should have saved my money and taken the photos myself. The pictures are amateur at BEST. The talent is non existent and you will see that numerous pictures are OUT OF FOCUS. It looks like most of the photographs were taken with a Kodak disposable camera. The photographer must need glasses if she thinks the pictures are in focus. Conclusion: Save your money. You'd be better off buying your own camera and taking pictures yourself. There are plenty of other GREAT gardening books out there with much better, well thought out, professional, in focus, photographs."
3,The Moves that Make the Form Flow,"The video moved and an active viewer must move with it. Student must practice the fundamentals video first. Also, some knowledge of Tai Chi is necessary as a prerequisite to this series. It is a great tai chi exercise sequence to be practiced over and over-- both with and without the tape. Actually video is a 3.5 Star and for those who have a foundation in the art."
3,Natural cork a + but too small,"Bought for my two box turtles' enclosure but it came as a whole hollowed log, not half a log like in the picture. Ended up separating in half along the natural lines of the bark but is too small for either one of my box turtles to fit under. Will probably have to add extentions under the sides to lift it up a bit and fill in the spaces with moss or more bark."
3,Does the job..,This product was not shaped the way it was described. It came as a log and I ordered it as a flat piece. But I was able to use it as a log alright. It turns the water yellow even after being used for two months with frequent water changes.. It isn't what I was expecting but it does the job..
3,You don't know what it'll look like,"Like the person before me said, you don't know what you'll get or what it'll look like, but it seems ok at first glance. The outer edges seem to flake off at first, I hope that after a wash and some wear, it'll stop that..."
5,BUY IT NOW!,"This is without a doubt the all time best thing that I have ever heard in my whole life. Every good thing that has happened in my life can be put to music that is on this cd. It will keep you rollin all night long and feel free to use your continue button on your player, you won't want this one to ever end. I personally guarantee it's absolute perfection. Please Kelly if your out there make another like this one so I can die happy."
3,Actually....too large,"Of the 3 wind chimes I bought, I thought I would like this one the most, but I like it the least. First, the butterflies are COVERED in glitter. You get glitter all over everything trying to untangle them. Secondly, the butterflies are metal, which I'm not using it outside until spring, but I would think it's going to rust eventually, although at least the butterflies won't break if it falls. The large glass beads might break, however, and I do mean LARGE, which brings me to problem #3--this whole item is just too big in scale. The butterflies are too big, the glass beads (the big ones, the little ones are plastic) are too big, and the bottom butterfly hangs down way to far which looks like it's a mistake when I don't think it is. It does sound pretty, but I bought 2 other, cheaper, acrylic wind chimes at the same time, and I like them much more than this one."
5,totally works,"I try to give my kids the most natural things as often as possible, including vitamins. I give this to both of my children everyday, & I really think it has warded off the flu among other bugs constantly going around this winter. I am a true believer of Elderberry syrup now! The times when I have gotten lazy & stopped giving it for a few days, is when they have gotten sick."
1,bummer ummagummer,"though I loved the original album, ""Ummagumma"", and was anxiously awaiting the delivery of this cd imagine my surprise and dismay when the only thing that reads on the disc player is ""no disc present"".Upon examining the disc itself it is truelly blank. I am very unhappy and disatisfied as I paid good money for good music and got nothing instead. It was a gift for my husband. Boy was he unhappy too. Cover looked good."
3,so far so good!,Have not had a chance to really take this as directed due to illness...but I'm on it!! No problems so far though!
5,It works,"I have struggled with dry skin all my life, finally something that helps my skin with no side effects or oily products to coat my self with."
5,Could Not Put It Down!,"This book is HOT!!!! I read the pages so quickly, I think the pages smoked. Worth every penny. I enjoyed it so much that I will be checking into more books by Mandy M. Roth."
4,A new take on a classic jazz gem,"The song is from Robert Frank and Arthur Leslie's quasi-vérité film, Pull My Daisy (1959), featuring major Beat writers Jack Kerouac (narrator), Allen Ginsberg, Larry Rivers and Gregory Corso. This new rendition is true to the original. The band Curse skillfully updates the jazz classic capturing the essence of the 1959 soundtrack. Helping capture the essence is the fact that Composer Amram plays on it. Amram grooves on the riff like never before, with spontaneity all the way. Marc Ribot shines as special guest, adding his trademark guitar stylings to the mix. The most interesting part of this single is the ""B side"" Graveyard Shuffle. The track is reminiscent of 1940s swing, only in the context of a rock n' roll track. Here, Amram and Ribot strut their stuff along with the NYC band."
1,Only 20g protein!,"There are two levels of protein in Biochem's Ultimate Protein System - one has 20g protein per serving and the other has 40g. I should have known the price was too good to be true, but the picture here clearly says 40g. So when I couldn't find a reference anywhere else in the product description, I thought I was ordering the one with 40g. Well, it arrived and of course is only 20g. So annoying. For $5 more you can get the 40g version at vitacost.com"
1,Disgusting taste,"This protein powder is one of the worst tasting powders I have used. Doesn't seem to matter what you mix it with, water or milk, it's not good.BIOCHEM makes a Chocolate Fudge whey protein powder that is significantly better tasting. I accidentally wound up with this item when I did not carefully read the item description."
3,"Outdated, but Interesting","This book is very outdated, but it contains interesting descriptions and photographs of an elder couple hiking the AT, which I believe gives it great inspirational attributes. Two grandparents hike the AT while staying in many bed and breakfasts along the way."
4,Just what I needed,This is exactly what I needed to leave my laptop connected to my Television. Some times I wish I'd bought the longer one.
5,Good Version for Children - and Adults too,"When I originally purchased this ""Junior Classic"" - as a gift for my little brother, an Arthur aficianado - I didn't expect to enjoy it much myself. However, the adaptation is well-done, and is not so inane as to make it unbearable to anyone over ten, which is what I expected. I was so pleasantly surprised that I went out and bought myself a copy!British actor Sean Bean has an incredible range of voices and accents, which he uses impeccably to enrich the characters he reads (though all the narrative is done in his lovely native Yorkshire). Morgana le Fay, Lancelot, Elaine, and, yes, Arthur all come to life as one listens. A very enjoyable audiobook, for bedtime or listening to in the car, or just as a mini-holiday!"
3,A Superficial Retelling of the Arthurian Legend,"Having read the other reviews, I feel as though I must offer a dissenting view. Most of the other reviewers enjoyed the way Benedict Flynn set out the whole King Arthur legend in an easy to follow narrative aimed at children. To do this, Flynn had to boil down the story to its most simple elements.In my opinion, this reductionist approach is the wrong way to introduce young children to one of the great stories of Western Literature. It is better to cull out individual stories from the legend and present them with all their rich details. Good examples of this alternative approach are David Borgenicht's ""The Legend of King Arthur"" and Margaret Hodge's ""The Kitchen Knight"". I believe the best way to get children to love King Arthur is to hook them on great individual stories. When they are older, they will string these stories together themselves with more sophiticated retellings of the legend."
4,King Arthur CD Audio Book,"Sean Bean's narration is absolutely fantastic! Worth the purchase price, alone. The scant music leaves a lot to be desired, and it's the only reason that I didn't give a 5-star review. If you're a Sean Bean fan, buy it NOW."
5,Best childhood memory ever!,"I must have sang these songs hundreds of times. The lyrics are written so thoughtfully and sincerely and you can hear the true emotion of the people singing. For me, that's what just made it great. I'm 44 now but I still remember every word of every song. Just a pure joy!!"
3,Great starter for those into device modeling,"I have often referenced this book for due to the nature of my graduate research. It is a good introduction to the finer points of semiconductor device modeling. (The stuff not really emphasized at the undergraduate level) However, this book is lacking with respect to many modern device structures and issues. (e. g. power transistors, HEMT's, III-V compound information) I still recommend it as reference material."
3,Amazon Purchased Pedal Exerciser,"Got exactly what I expected. When knob tightened, does a very good job. You feel it in your hips and thighs."
3,NOT ASSEMBLED,"Does the job, but the product description clearly states that it comes assembled, hence why I bought this specific one, as it is for my 63 year old mother. No bueno, guys...."
3,Nice little stationary bike,"Nice sturdy little stationary bike. I have lost over 100 pounds and am always looking for ways to move more. So I bought it thinking I could put it under my desk at work and pedal while I was working, however my knees hit the desk so that didn't work. Otherwise I am very pleased with it. I was only going to use it as a supplement to my normal workouts....I would never use it as a main workout as its not ""enough"" exercise for me. But if this was all you could do its better then nothing. Check out Burn Your Fat Pants dot com"
1,May cause painful burns,"After 30 minutes of use I went to move the product, and was severely burned on my ring, enough to cause a blister over 1 inch long and 1/3 inch wide. I had no idea it would get hot enough to burn my skin. The product stayed warm long after use. It is definitely dangerous for children, and obviously adults."
2,Good item - in theory,"This seemed like such a good way to get exercise while sitting at my desk. Unfortunatey, what happens is, when I pedal, my chair which is on rollers, moves backward. The only way to make this work is to have a chair without wheels or to brace the back of the chair against something."
1,foot excerciser,"When used for longer than three minutes it got hot to the touch, I had to throw it out. This happened even after I would loosened it many times"
2,pedal exerciser,"frame was bent, and the exerciser never sat evenly on a floor surface. seven mores words, really, what would you like me to say besides it was faulty ??"
4,Pedlar,shipped quickly perfect for my aged mother who needs to exercise but dose not want to walk...stable and compact ..thank you
2,Reviewed by a metalhead.,"Agree with previous comment. This is not their best work. Everything after this is fantastic! If you like Pantera, you need to hear these guys."
2,not their best work,"from a band that has definite skills and brutal power this cd falls short,their newer work is much better!"
1,They Died with their boots on,Very disappointed in volume 1. I specifically ordered it to watch They died with their boots on and the DVD doesn't work! Trying to contact Customer service about it now!
5,Errol Flynn Signature Collection,"I love this collection but would have liked it much better if ""Robin Hood"" was included or instead of ""Dodge City"". Such a nice way to start a collection of an actors work whom I've always admired.Regina Maxim"
3,Good collection but something missing...,"Nice Errol Flynn boxset but missing one Great movie that is one of all time favorites ""The Adventures of Don Juan""! I did find it as a Korean Import right here at Amazon.com and happily added it to my Flynn Dvd Library. ""The Adventures of Don Juan"" is a must for any Flynn Fan or swordsman aficionado . Otherwise this is a nice set that you will appreciate and cherish to have and to watch over and over."
2,Don't Bother,Everyone who knows these movies know they're great the problem is the quality of the dvd's got one set and two movies didn't work. They sent a replacement and again two movie would not play. Not sure who Amazon has burning their movies but they are completely incompetent. Its just frustrating.
3,Good Movies,Big WWII fan and this makes the grade. I haven't seen this in a while. Doesn't come on TV that often.no I don't have to wait.
5,A Classic is back!,"A terrific film by the legendary Sam Fuller (BIG RED ONE) and starring Jeff Chandler -- in his last screen performance -- and a slew of Warner Bros tv stars: Ty Hardin, Will Hutchins, Peter Brown and Andrew Duggan. Glad to see that WB is finally bringing this one to DVD. This story was actually done once before with Errol Flynn in OBJECTIVE BURMA. Both are extremely entertaining but the Fuller version rings closer to the truth. Also a nice performance by John Hoyt as Gen. ""Vinegar"" Joe Stillwell. A great war epic about men being asked to push themselves beyond the limits of human endurance. Jeff Chandler is in top-form in this, his last, performance. Ty Hardin (Bronco Lane of tv fame) as his Lt. Stock -- whom Merrill regards almost as a son. I had the good fortune to actually see this in the theatre when I was a kid."
4,War in Burma,"A well done film about the adversity American troops encountered fighting the Japanese in Burma during World War II. Jeff Chandler does an excellent job in this film about Merrill's Marauders. Scenery and color are vivid, and the battles fought are depicted very well in comparison to the actual ones. The fighting in the rail yard is memorable and dramatizes the dangers of close combat in such an environment. Some of the Filipino actors playing Japanese soldiers get a bit carried away, but not enough to spoil this must see film about World War II."
4,It's the Maurauders!,"I think this is the only movie done about Merrill and his outfit in Burma during WWII. I watched this movie as a kid and really liked it. Hell, I still like it! It is full of MGM TV's contract players of the day. It is worth the buy."
3,Good Flick,"This is a fine film with your typical ""characters"" mixed in with very beliveable members of an elite military unit. Based on fact with colorful tweaks it is a rainy day popcorn movie. Too bad you can pick out who will ""get it"" from the first 15 minutes of the film! But this was typical of the time. I would still say add it to your collection and keep it handy for opening talks with the kids about what happens and what is shown to happen by Hollywood...then have them look it up on Google and learn the true story...could make for fun."
4,Finally,"I have always wanted a widescreen version of the movie and now it is finally out and is a very good presentation. For those of you who don't know, Jeff Chandler was injured while making this movie and died of complications in the operation to fix the problem."
3,GOOD MOVIE,"THE CONTENT OF THE MOVIE IS GOOD, BUT THE QUALITY OF THE VHS TAPE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LISTED POOR RATHER THAN GOOD. SOME PORTIONS OF THE MOVIE WERE BARELY RECOGNIZABLE BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY OF THE TAPE. IT WAS NOT WORTH SPENDING THE MONEY TO SEND IT BACK. I HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE ON TV AND IT IS ONE I WANTED TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION."
2,Average Over-rated War Movie,"I thought this was a very average over rated war movie. I purchased this movie, partially based on the review's on the Amazon website and I thought it was a dud. If this movie is based on real life, the General in charge didn't seem to care or value the soldiers lives in his command and he expected them to fight, when it was obvious that they were worn out and exhausted."
2,disgusted,"the movie would be a good movie, if I could see it! trying to watch a 9 inch high picture on a 27 inch tv is like threading a needle with your eyes closed. I purchased this movie BECAUSE it was listed by AMAZON.COM as a full screen (1.33:1 ratio) movie. I truly hate watching BIG UGLY BLACK LINES on my tv screen and I do not normally purchase movies that include them. I have to squint to see the action. like watching a football game from the 'nose bleed' section. whoever thinks 'the black lines at the top and bottom of your screen are normal' really needs their head checked. if they were 'normal' no one would have to tell me! I also have a 42"" LCD widescreen tv and the black lines are on it too!"
3,"Slim, Beautiful player, but skips too much","I bought this from Circuit City yesterday for 90 dollars. since it was the smallest, and cheapest CD/mp3 player with FM tuner, i decided to buy it and see how it works.It sounds great! it's remote controller has backlit light so it's easy to use at night. its surface is made out of thin, very strong aluminum(or metal, don't know exactly), not like other cheap cdplayers that are made out of cheap plastics.However, the anti-shock is a total joke. it says 960 seconds shock resistant. No, it's more like 9.6 seconds shock resistant. i wasn't even running. I was walking with this in my pocket, and it was skipping like crazy!So here is my summary.Pro:1. Solid construction.2. Perfect sound quality.3. Everything is built-in.4. Nice remote controller.Cons:1. It skipps too much."
2,Laggy,"The cd player has a beautiful design but it lacks many things, which I expected from a Samsung product. First of all, it skips a lot. I had it lying on a desk without moving it and it still manages to skip every once in a while. Second, there is a great lag in between songs and the song stops in the middle and seems to never resume. And when the songs are changing, it makes a loud whirring noise which gets annoying. The anti-skip system is a scam. It says 960 seconds, but it's more like 9.6 seconds. I wouldn't recommend this product to others. For cell phones, get a Samsung. For a CD walkman, get a Sony or something else."
2,Not nearly as good as others books by this publisher,"Although I have only a limited interest in Thai food, I bought this book because Wei Chuan publications are generally excellent (lots of pictures and good recipes) and because I was interested to see how a Chinese publication would treat this cuisine. The recipes were mostly interesting, and there are pictures for each recipe, but the final result is disappointing. Unlike most Wei Chuan books, this one seemed rather quickly and sloppily put together: Several recipes listed ingredients that did not seem to be used in the directions and photographs accompanying some recipes seemed to have been intended for other dishes. I have always given good reviews to Wei Chuan publications but this is not nearly as good as others."
5,Excellent Instructions,I have tried most of the recipes! They are simple and make you look like you know what your doing. Most items are made in less than 15 minutes. The sauces taste great and are very basic. Our guests love them. I recommend this to anyone who likes to cook!
3,LGKG800,"The phone is quite a nice basic phone but has two main problems, when it gets humid the screen flips to different screens and could be quit irritating and the 2nd problem is the battery, it wears off within 4-5 months and make sure that your fingers a very dry before you use the touch pad otherwise you could end up tossing it out of the window."
4,Only last 4 months before it broke.,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She loved the sleek look of it. Its pretty easy to use. It was great for all of about 4 months till it broke. Please note my girl friend is on her fourth phone since the 2 years i've known her.
4,Cheap and Comfortable,"This guy does the trick. I like that it's soft, but not too soft that it doesn't actually support your wrist well enough. I'm not sure what's with the design of it on the right hand side where it separates just a bit, but I'm assuming it's for use with the 10 key portion of a keyboard?Anyhow, this is a pretty functional wrist wrest that is cheap and seems to hold up decently well. I recommend it for under $10."
4,Decent Wrist Pad,"After using it for a while, the cushion seems to start getting a groove, nothing too serious, but may become an issue in the long run."
2,Good wrist support but doesn't last,"I'm on my second one of these, and it does provide good wrist support and help diminish the pain I would experience after long hours at the keyboard. But both of the Kensington keyboard wrist pads I have owned have lasted only a couple of months before the black outer material starts seperating from the base and peeling back to expose the gel material underneath. I wouldn't buy another one and am going to try another brand."
4,Very comfortable pad,"Supremely comfortable soft and squidgy wrist rest. We had a batch of these bought for us at work and it's made a big difference for me.I've had mine for well over two years now, and the black neoprene-like (not sure if it is actually neoprene, check if you're allergic) covering is still well attached to the base of the pad. While all office ones have lasted well, some have had this peel-off problem another reviewer mentioned.The only obvious wear and tear with mine is a sort of air-pocket/bubble which has formed on one end from where I accidentally spilled coffee on it.So only 4 stars, as I have seen some problems, but would have given 5 based on my personal item."
3,"It's nice, but a little awkward with iMac keyboards","I purchased this wrist pillow for use with my iMac (aluminum model). The keyboard for these computers sits lower than the height of this wrist pillow, which makes it awkward to use if you place it right at the base of the keyboard (which is how most of us use keyboard wrist pillows). If you separate the keyboard and wrist pillow about 4-5 inches it helps, but it still doesn't feel quite as natural as if you were using it with a PC keyboard. Works very nicely with PC keyboards, however."
2,wrong picture,"the amazon picture above is not what they are selling, above picture shows a pad with uniform width the full length, but what they send is a kensington pad with one side for letter keys and one side for numbers with a curbed break in the pad between the two. not uniform."
2,"Good for the color, not for the quality","I essentially purchased these tires because they were relatively cheap, they had decent reviews about their ""silkworm technology"", rolling resistance, and the orange matched my frame. I doubt I have ridden more than 300 miles on them and have had at around 4 or 5 flats. I do live near a college campus, so I can't deny there isn't hidden glass in parking lots and the roads. Despite this, I have had flats when riding back home where the streets are good quality and there is no street litter. I have been fairly disappointed with these tires. At least they didn't cost me too much."
1,Tryptych,"Not Karin Slaughter's best, I was disappointed and the more I read her other books (aside from her 1st 3) she does not follow Trent's relationships in a constant manner. Not thrilled with that."
5,Suspenseful from the first page until the last!,"This is an amazing book, wow! The best thriller that I have read in a long time. I love Karin Slaughter's writing style especially in this book, so captivating! I read this book anywhere I could get a few minutes to myself - I liked it so much that I had it on me at all times. A+"
3,Not one of her best.,"I have read all of Karin Slaughter's books and I find it hard to believe that she wrote this book. The others were excellent and were hard to put down. But this book was hard to believe and the storyline did not make much sense. But, I look forward to reading any new books that come out soon. Just did not think it was one of her best."
3,Great characters bad format,I like this book but I hated the way it was presented in 3 layers. As soon as I got attached to a character they'd switch and go to another one.
5,Excellent Novel,This is an excellent novel. Couldn't put it down. I think Karen Slaughter is one of the best mystery writers I have ever read. She is just a great writer.
2,Not A Good Idea...,"I've read all of Slaughter's books since her first, BLINDSIGHTED, and each one only became better than the last. I raced through FAITHLESS (which is great, by the way) to begin TRIPTYCH.....and am totally disappointed in this book. It simply isn't worth the read. Karin Slaughter has followed Patricia Cornwell in departing from her tried and true main character and format to do a stand-alone book.A horse of a very different color. There isn't even a trace of her feminine flair for forensics (how's that for alliteration?) anywhere...just a lot of severed tongues and gorey murder scenes and a cast of ugly and unlikeable cretins who made me want to toss the book without finishing it.I did finish it but I hated it.I understand Slaughter is at work on another such book and my only comment, regarding a successful writing genre is: if it isn't broken, don't fix it."
1,A waste of time,"This is my first and last Karin Slaughter novel. I love a good murder mystery as well as the next person, but I also appreciate some redeeming qualities in the characters portrayed. I couldn't like any of these people! I felt betrayed after part one, because I started to like and feel sorry for Michael, I really disliked Angie, and felt nothing but pity for Will. I'm all about having ""real"" characters with flaws and all that but come on, could we at least try to have some good with the bad here?There were some unexpected twists, but overall I was extremely disappointed that I took the time to read this book. It is too vulgar with no warmth to balance it."
4,Good plot and very good characters,"This is the first Slaughter book I have read and thought it was good. I haven't read a book in quite a while which I didnt want to put down.What I liked most about the book was the characters. The fact they are not perfect. Its the difference between watching Mannix and The Rockford Files. I loved Rockford for the flaws, and thats what this book has in its characters. These days it seems I can't finish a book because the characters are so boring and perfect. Not wanting to give the book away, I thought there was at least one character ( as opposed to other reviews ) that was an anchor. But you have to take off one set of glasses which are used in the beginning of the book, and put on another set later. If you don't make that switch, I can see how you would think all the characters are unlikable.Anyhow. The plot was typical serial killer senario, but with characters with some Character!I'll be getting another book of hers shortly!"
5,RIVITING from start to finish!!!,If you want a book to just casually read this is not the book for you! Once you start you can not put it down! Great read
4,Triptych (Will Trent) by Karin Slaughter,I enjoyed the book and I am reading the second book in the series now. A good mystery book and the characters are very interesting and charming. Some characters you like and some you do not care for which keeps the book interesting.
4,Triptych,"This was the second book I've read with the character of Will Trent. The first one I read was the most recent book from Karen Slaughter called ""Broken"" which I actually liked more. However I still found this to be a very good book. I thought it to be a little slow at first but after the first major twist happened I couldn't put the book down. It was a good read and will definitely continue the series. I would say this book is great for any one like likes crime/ mystery novels"
4,Who killer the girl next door?,"This was the first time reading karin slaughter book,and let me tell you it was so many turns that I couldn't stop turning.To read this book and the murders taking place in Atlanta, where I live you ask yourself is this a true story? Its strange young women are getting kill with someone cutting out there tongues, out there mouths it make you feel that this story is real.Its alot of players that have entered this game,and guess who the killer is? and you will be surprised."
2,It could be a blockbuster but...,This book could be an excellent one. A paramount story. You'll never have an inkling of who's the bad guy. The problem with this plot is to find it! You'll read and read and get nothing important of the main plot and that's disappointing while reading any book. Definitely KS has much better books than this one.
3,Worth reading,"Definetly a different kind of detective novel. You'll have it figured out fairly soon, but still worth investing the time."
5,More excellent writing from Karin Slaughter,I started reading Karin Slaughter's Grant County books a few months ago and came to love the characters. I was afraid I wouldn't be as fond of Will Trent - but it only took a few pages to know that I was going to enjoy this book and the new characters. Excellent story and believable characters. I know I will continue to read this series as well.
4,A Great Read,"This is my first book by this author and I found it well written and its story interesting, exciting and occasionally humorous. Unnecessarily vulgar, it's true, but once you've accepted that, most entertaining. I will now look at some of her other books. If you don't mind a lot of X-rated language, I would certainly recommend it."
3,Good read from an interesting author,I had started to read this while on vacation about 3 years ago and just now got back to it. It has an intriguing premise and is well written for this genre.
4,Loved it,"After reading a short story by Karen slaughter, gave this a go and really liked it. I am keen to read more."
5,One of the best I've read in a long time!!,This book grabbed my attention early on. Throughout the book there are many twists and turns. Enjoyed it very much!!
4,I like anything Karin Slaughter writes!,"This is a good, well-written book--I did not enjoy it as much as her other books, but she is such a competent writer that anyone would have to enjoy the writing and the story."
5,Amazing!!!!!,1 of Karin Slaughters best books:) I have read all her books and I do love all of them but this was a the best
4,Capturing,This is a book that draws you in and makes you question all motives from of each of the characters.
5,Captivating,This book drew me in from the beginning. The Trent character is very complex and interesting. Kept my attention and very fast read.
4,I enjoyed the book,"I really enjoyed this book although I wish it had a bit more twists and turns , it was a bit predictable."
4,A very good murder mystery.,"I make a point to read the reviews written by others as I'm often surprised at the reason given to pan a book. It's reasonable to have a variety of opinions on any given subject but a murder mystery is just that, and this story by Karin Slaughter is a very good murder mystery. The characters are believable, and well developed. The story is interesting and although the author admits to having done little research all the information fits the circumstances. There are twists and surprises, and if you don't read every page you'll surely do yourself an injustice. This was the first of Ms. Slaughter I've read as the book was loaned to me, however, for the moment, I'm hooked. Be warned though there is very colorful language throughout."
5,"A sexy, dark ,entertaining thriller","I thought this was as great read! The author is easy to read and is very descriptive without boring you out of your mind. I really love the characters dialog, the gritty feel of all of the action, and of course that this is chock full of adult content in precisely measured doses. I burned through this book on my commute. . .rather read this than sleep on the train so it must be good! I love how she reveals a twist by shifting the perspective too! Ending was a little weak, who cares, you'll be entertained!"
3,Fun- but not as much fun as the other sets,"We got this set for our 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas along with the Carwash, Haunted House, and buried treasure set. He enjoys playing with it, but it is not as much fun as the others. It is smaller so the cars don't have as much to do. The animal noises are a neat addition to the ""matchbox town"" though. Assembly was easy which is always a plus!"
2,Think twice,"Was disappointed in content. I'd been anticipating more ""meat"". In hindsight, would not spend my money here again."
4,John Lyons: Bring up baby,"It's a good book and I like all of John Lyons' material. I bought it before my colt was born and while I like the excercises, they seem for more like a one or two year old or a foal that's never been handled or imprint trained. Alot of his stuff uses the round pen to work and that's fine, but you can't really lunge them till they're two and while you can do what he does in here younger, because it's very light, you don't want to over do it and mess up their limbs or back. Like I said, it's a good book, but more for older foals who have never been handled or imprint trained and are possibly weaned already. I would go with Robert Millars Imprint Training if you are wanting to get a good foundation from the start and this book if you are getting your foal as a weanling. It's excellent for what it is, but I see it being used in limited circumstances."
4,Good Book,Good book to use when teaching a baby. Not all the ideas work for me as some of them are difficult unless you have the strength to muscle a baby.
2,Hold It!,This is not a McKenna solo album. You will hear very little of McKenna here-on. This album was originally recorded in 1977 and is a remaster done in 2001. ... No aknowlegement is given to the other performers period. I don't recommend this recording.
2,Good for the pictures not the food,This cookbook was done in the 1980's. The recipes aren't impressive but the pictures are good to look at. A good coffee table book.
3,Out of Print and Out of Date,"I got this book at the library because most of the linguistic writing on gender based language studies quote it. Lakoff's theories seem largely out of date-for example, a discussion on whether ""Ms."" will ever come into use. The material is based on her observations rather than any experiment and there is no data. Still, the book is thought provoking. It is also interesting to see how language perceptions, and the role of women in society has changed (or failed to change) in the past 25 years."
1,Too bad it didn't work.,"I purchased theWildlife Research 100 Ultimate Bear Lure Bear Attractor (4-Fluid Ounce)and used it on the Early Bear Hunt in NYS Adirondacks. I hunted 3 days Sept 15, 16, and 17, 2012 and used the product as directed hanging a strip of rag soaked with the lure) six feet above the ground. While I could smell it (very sweet). I did not lure in any bears.I ame going to Colorado this Oct )2012)to hunt Elk and Black Bear, I will try it then, however I am not sure if it is legal to use in Colorado. If it is not legal I will NOT use it. I only gave it one star because I did smell it, however it did not produce the expected results as advertized."
1,hate this movie,i hated this movie one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life i could barley make it though the hole thing this is the only john hughes film i dont like i usually like all his films this is why i bought the movie but it was a big disapointment and im also a fan of kevin bacon another reason i got it but it still was horrible some people might like it but i dont my favorite part of this movie was the end
5,Disappointed,"This video was old and appeared to be a Celebrity Cruise Line advertisement. It dealt a great deal with the city of New York. Since our cruise was leaving out of Baltimore and we were not on Celebrity Cruise Line, I was disappointed."
1,Inferior tool,"Mirometer came in a nice box and looked good when opened - even if it looks drastically different than the product pictured. Wanted to use the micrometer right away for a job and used the included standard to calibrate it. With the standard in the mic. and the ""zero"" lines matched up, the instrument reads a full .025"" below 4"". (It's a 4""-to-5"" micrometer). So the tool is a full .025"" off. While I might be able to take it apart and try to get it set correctly, I should not have to work on a brand new precision measuring instrument to get it to measure correctly. I am attempting to return it, but have not heard back from the vender as of yet."
4,Interesting studies,"If you're a Klimt fan, I do recommend this book. It's filled with interesting (and rather simple) studies of many of his paintings, as well as personal works. It's an interesting way to get acquainted to Klimt's process and vision."
2,2.0 out of 5 stars Gustaf Klimpt 100 drawings,"Very poor quality reproductions. While I was happy to get 100 drawings, some were hard to even see. The paper quality plus the gray background made it very unsatisfying."
5,"X-ACTO Mighty Mite, The perfect electric pencil sharpener to have next t to the computer","The Mighty Mite electric pencil sharpener, is the perfect electric pencil sharpener to have at your computer desk, ready to sharpen pencils. Why is it best for use at the computer? It even shows a woman using it at her computer on the box, so you know that it's great for this. Not only is it great to have as a computer desk partener, but we I also sharpen pencils only when they need touched up, unless we are in need of a fresh pencil, which is only when we sell new items on Ebay. Overall, the Mighty Mite is the bst electric pencil sharpener to have if you're planning on being a seller on eaby, only sharpen pencil that need touched up, and don't require an extremely powerful sharpener. Remember to buy the X-ACTO model, becuase they are the same sharpener, but the X-ACTO has better blades and sharpens faster"
4,This is the music to buy if you want to have a good time,This reminds you of stuff you were doing a couple years ago. Its a really good mix
3,an introdcution in the German tradition,"Historical anthropology is an interesting field dealing with the human experiences in history (broadly speaking). Dressel's book offers a thorough introduction to the topic but, like many German authors his language is highly academic which makes the book difficult to read."
3,uptown saturday night,"Great screen chemistry between Cosby & Portier! The characters are funny and likable. This movie was directed byPortier, showing the world his lighter side!"
4,Best black dynamic duo!!,"This movie always make me laugh! The time period, in the '70s, is very special to me having been a preteen during that time. Seeing this reminds me of the brown and gold shag carpet, the beaded curtain, and bushy ferns that were throughout my house growing up in that era; not to mention the pumping funk music! Great times! The comedy was a little slow at times, but the vernacular of the time was hilarious. My favorite saying came from Bill Cosby when he said, ""I'm from off the corners!"". If you like these type of films, I think you'll also enjoy this one."
5,Uptown Saturday Night,This movie is great. Action and funny all at the same time. Even though its a little lengthy it keeps your attention to the end.
2,Not as pleased as most reviewers,"I put this DVD on my wish list because of the many enthusuiastic reviews left by others. I was disappointed in the slow pace and the minimal humor. However, this is a good period piece of 1970s film-making."
2,Save your money.,"Perhaps I was spoiled by seeing ""Let's Do It Again"" first. This movie was a disappointment; it is too long, not that funny, and the ending abrupt and clumsy. However, it is worth watching - once if it's free. Otherwise, save your money."
4,Great Gift,"My nephew loves ""Bug Bingo"" and since he's also into Dinosaurs, this was an obvious choice when I needed to get him a present. These games are great, and educational.My only comment about ""Dinosaur Bingo"" as it relates to this particular game franchise is that dinosaurs have challenging names. That being said, it's not the game makers fault... they even include phonetic spelling - but ""Bug Bingo"" is much easier for him to play because there are less syllables in the words."
1,Its Not All True.......,"I was in the school... My story is in this book. I bought the book to read. I thought at first wow, Look at what my principle done. He wrote a book about where I grew up. I start at the first page. I get into the book and next thing I know, There is it. My brother death!! Which would not have been a big deal if the lies where not in there. He made alot of stuff up. The stuff with my family in this book are NOT true. Plus to use my brothers death to make money is just down right sick.I have been deeply hurt by what was wrote in this book and the way he made things out to be. Very unhappy That someone who make stuff up and use a death of a child/ student to make money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Shades of Jeff Buckley,"Patrick Watson's voice is so eerily like that of the dearly departed Jeff Buckley....they both share a range and sweetness that overwhelm me at times. Listen to the passage from around 1:00 to 2:00 minutes on ""Daydreamer"" (track 2) and you'll hear what I'm talking about. My one quibble with Watson is that he sometimes overproduces his songs. ""Daydreamer"" is also a good illustration of that point -- the melody is lovely but Watson chooses to clutter it up with all manner of rather low-end special effects that would have been better kept in his synthesizer's memory. ""Luscious Life"" (track 8) also reminds me slightly of Sufjan Stevens. I'm hard pressed to detect any influence by Debussy or Satie, no matter what Watson's bio says.This is a promising effort, and highly recommended."
5,No.......You're Not Alone,"As you read the various reviews of this disc you might notice something - a mysterious connection that people seem to find with this band. Of the reviews I read, no one could put a finger on it, but everyone felt it.That's why I love this band.I primarily listen to much heavier music, but there is something so refreshing about Del Amitri, it's completely captivating.You're probably familiar with the popular songs on this disc, but I bet when you listen to it all the way through there will be a couple that pop up and you'll think ""I didn't know they did this song.""As for haunting, you must hear: Nothing Ever Happens, Driving With The Brakes On, and Tell Her This.Words can't describe."
5,Simply the best hits album of the 90s,"If you like ""Roll to Me"", you will love this album. Actually, that song is the weakest one on the entire album, despite being their biggest hit. If you can listen to ""Be My Downfall Tonight"" or ""Here and Now"" and not be moved, you are a better person than I. Add in some great rockers like ""Kiss This Thing Goodbye"" (one of the should-have-been-big songs of the decade) and ""Stone Cold Sober"" and you have the perfect album for driving in your car or sitting on a beach somewhere. Plus, there's the Scottish World Cup song from last 1998, ""Don't Come Home Too Soon"". Unfortunately, the team didn't take it to heart, but you will after a couple of listens."
5,A must read for any Exchange administrator!,"Its quite obvious that the author has many years in the field working with Exchange, and the fact that his experiences are interwoven into this book (along with his easy to read writing style) makes this book one of my favorites. Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 Distilled covers a tremendous amount of highly relevant and useful information. Its a great resource for anyone that wants or needs to better understand how Exchange 2003 works, and in what circumstances to configure particular features. I am so glad that he wrote it, and that I now have it in my own Exchange resource library! It is also worth noting that since writing this book, the author has joined the Exchange User Education team at Microsoft. His expertise is widely acknowledged, and his book an invaluable resource."
2,Too little for too much,"Disappointing book. A sort of technical gossip about Exchange. Here and there can find some useful hints, but it lacks the basic information about how Exchange 2003 works, how messages are flowing.Many topics are no more than a laundry list of features, no personal experience in there, no how to use them, when and why.I had the felling of reading Microsoft marketing materials rather than a professional's personal experience with Exchange.The books offer some advices but is more like a check list, doesn't make you more knowledgeable about Exchange."
4,Good party disc!,"This is good stuff - and of course it has the great ""Justified and Ancient"" with Tammy and the KLF. Good beat, good music, good stuff."
3,Short life,Burns out quick in a stream light Polly-tac but hey its a bright light.Looking for a rechargeable stream light to replace these battery's
1,Partially Charged Bateries,These batteries should be 3.4 and they are closer to 3. The first two I tried lasted only a few weeks. They are a reasonable price but probably not worth the savings b/c they have to be replaced so often. A disappointing purchase.
4,I got batts!,"Unfortunately my favorite flashlight takes these batteries. They're expensive. They're not common. They fit. They work. They last a good while. If they were less expensive, I would give them five stars."
3,A Drop of Water,"The pictures in this book are excellent, but the reading level is not 4-8 as listed. The level is about 6th grade and above."
2,A Drop of water,This was slightly more advanced reading than I expected. I was hoping it would be for younger childrenm 2-3 grade. But some parts can be used.
4,The Four Provinces,The expression you get what you pay for is true here. The flag is very functional and is great hung up on my dorm wall (white) but if the wall wasn't white then the other color would have bled through. And ALSO where each province is on the picture is completely different than what it is on the actual flag.
1,Cheap Cheap Chinese Quality,"You get what you pay for. Graphics look unprofessional, Chinese characters show through white 1 inch border between grommets."
1,"DESIGN IS WRONG, PROVINCES ARE OUT OF ORDER",The flag has 2 of the provincial symbols in the wrong places. Leinster (SE) should be on the bottom right and Connaught (NW) should be on the upper left. Just another wrong version of this flag.
5,Better than just a poem a day.,"This book is a good buy even if you don't really plan to read a poem a day. This book is an excellent anthology that shouldn't be missed. As a student, I know that some poetry books can have some bad choices, but this book is not like that. Every poem is good and makes you think. You won't be sorry if you pick this book up."
5,A MUST HAVE!!,"i love this cd! i just cant hear it enough. all of these songs sound like a little childs melody with a 140 bpm speed! ""dawn of a new era"" is one of the best songs on this whole cd. ......there are alot of others too. but the best songs on this cd are: reach out, go insane, its not over, forever, i believe, muzic, **dawn of a new era, now is the time, and wanting to get high. "" i believe' sounds really cool. it has a lot of down tones in it, meaning that sound slows down, like a record that was on 75 drug down to 45. and forever sounds really warped and happy. not all of these songs get up to 140 bpm, but its all 100% happy hardcore"
2,Hmmmmm,"Hehe.... One time someone told this CD was made to be hated.. LOL.... The CD isnt all that bad (I've heard worse). I mean I can stand some songs. Its really because I'm a trancefreak BIG TIME! Never did acquire a taste happy hardcore....sounds like house on speed. I really dont recommend this CD at all...dont waste your money (I didnt... friend gave it to me.... now i know why he gave it away...lol), but if you're into all that jazz, dive right in."
1,UUUUUHHHH,"Happy Hardcore hast to be the worst music ever made. Someone gave me this cd and I took it out after 2 minutes. All of the drum and bass people who are into the old skool always talking about bringing it back to hardcore, or the energy of hardcore, well they obviously wernt talking of this. This is pure garbage. Its not that I cant handle the BPMs (its just a bit faster than Drum and Bass) but this is bad, speed up vocals. UHHH. I stepped on the cd so that no one would have to hear it ever again. I feel I did the world a favor. I did not expect candy raver stuff, I thought it would be good Champion Sound, Terrorist (by Q project and ray keith) but no, I got a cd full of rubbish, which incidently made it into the garbage can. DONT BUY THIS, IT IS BAD"
1,45rpm at 78rpm,"I was looking for music to work out to. I've got some darude and some Oakenfold that gets into the 130-140 bpm range for me when I'm on the elliptical, so I was looking for something similar..Wow. This is just... wow. Most of you are probably kids who don't remember record players, this ""music"" sounds like somebody took a 45 or a 33' and put it on 78rpm. The vocals are high pitched and screechy, there is little bass, and the beat while quick is not exactly driving.Maybe this is great for dancing around while hopped on goofballs, but it doesn't cut it for workout music. I'm glad I found it at a 2nd hand store for $5, it's going right back to the 2nd hand store."
1,Music better than performer.,"As always, Jim (Roger) does a great job on record but continues to be one of the worst guys in the business when it comes to one on one interaction with concert attendees. Surely, he doesn't still think he's the only one still playing and singing old songs to old folks."
5,Love Roger!,I love this album. I bought this one for a friend as I enjoyed mine so much. Roger and Camilla are wonderful!
4,Good but not great,"It kind of cracks me up the title to this CD; ""Limited Edition""? As if you won't be able to get a copy and hurry up before they are all sold?? What a joke. Kind of a commercial ruse if you ask me. I am sure McGuinn likes making money(and lots of it)like anyone else and he'll keep on pumping out CD's until he catches his Chestnut Mare. He plays fairly well live but still lacks stage presence and fails miserably to connect to his audiences. I found him boring and trite in his live performance. He's better in the studio."
3,Not very good,"If you love to read on histories, then this book is perfect for you, but it's not good for anyone who needs a quick reference guide or who needs pictures. This book will give you one or two examples of an entire company, and the pictures are in black and white for the most part.However it will give you histories of companies and a mark or two. if your new to this, i don't recommend this book at all. Instead go with Warman's Field Guide instead."
3,Warman's American Pottery & Porcelain,"I returned this book because I was looking for more photos to refer to. I thought, for a beginner, this book was too difficult to follow."
5,relaxing with great cleaning power,"I have only used this peppermint bar soap in the shower, but here are some pros and cons:Pros: all natural, fair trade, no harsh chemicals, great suds!, takes off SO much dirt, refreshing scent (true peppermint), doesn't strip skin of natural oils, cleans wonderfully, only need to lather my washcloth twice to clean entire bodyCons: peppermint is uncomfortable in private areas, the bar is soft (so keep it out of water so it doesn't melt away)"
5,"Expensive, but good","I have used the Dr. Bronner's soaps previously and liked them all a lot. The Eucalyptus soap is no exception. The only problem was that I bought the soap through Amazon's reseller ""The Vitamin Shoppe"" and since they have stores near my house, I had to pay shipping for the soap and sales tax. Other than that, I like the soap very much."
3,me gusto mucho,"queria probar el producto por eso lo compre, ademas quiero probar las demas fraganciasme gusto mucho. es muy buenolo recomendaria ampliamente es realmente un producto organico"
3,The soap outlasts the scent in Bronner's Castile Peppermint Bar Soap,"It takes lots of hot water and rubbing to release the 1st blast of peppermint scent from Bronner's Castile Bar Soap. It was great for the first 3 or 4 showers and even made the entire bathroom smell great for a few minutes after the shower.The smaller the bar of soap gets the less amount of scent per square inch you get. Now, 2 months later, there is still a bit of soap left to use but NO SCENT.This is as opposed toPeppermint 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)which I bought at the same time for around the same price, but it maintains its potency because little chunks of actual peppermint leaves permeate the entire bar of soap.Bronner's Castile Bar Soap Peppermint is fun at first, but ultimately not worth the money."
2,Smells Bad and Doesn't Lather,"I was looking for an alternative Rose scented soap so thought I'd try Dr. Bronner - Organic Castile Soap. I won't buy it again. It smells more like bad soap than rose and doesn't lather very well, not even in soft-water."
5,An absolute wonderful journey into a once forbidden country.,"I have read all of Peter's books and have fallen in love with his exciting journeys. But none have touched me as much as ""Across China"". No anthropologist could touch the 'ways' of the Chinese people as Peter has. The 'fixes' he gets himself into (and out) are so hilarious that you find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat right along with him. The book is so well written that you find yourself on the last page before you are ready to close the back cover. You are guaranteed to read Peter Jenkins books more than once as watching a best selling movie over and over."
4,"Fascinating, quick-paced personal trip through some new cultures","I found this book fascinating, not knowing much about the people, places, and culture described in it. It was relaxing and quick to read, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I recommend this for anyone interested in a personal account of different cultures and places."
1,Peter Jenkins can't write to save his life,"Being fascinated with the geography and cultures of Asia, I picked up this book, excited to read another travelogue about China. After plodding through about 80 pages, waiting for it to get interesting, I quit reading and decided that this was the only book that I would ever actually throw away. Peter is a horrible author, his writing style is about on the low grade school level and I have no idea how he ever got signed to a book contract.To anyone considering this book, save your money and go read ""Riding the Iron Rooster,"" by Paul Theroux or any other adventure book that's been written about this part of the world."
5,Focus on the Family Radio Theatre - Awesome as usual!,"Not only entertaining, but also thought-provoking. Focus on the Family Radio Theatre does an excellent job portraying the life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. All ages will be on the edge of their seats as they listen. The audio and acting are high-quality, the drama is easy to follow, and the story of Bonhoeffer will lead you to evaluate what is important in life. I have owned this product for several years and have listened to it over and over again. My family enjoys it too. This drama has been a great way to learn about the life of Bonhoeffer (a great man) and the effects of Nazism on the religious freedoms of Germans during WWII."
2,Good resource if you already know what you are doing.,"Jeff Allen's book will be of particular value to the intermediate tanguero. However, he lacks the ability to be concise in his explanation of basic steps. Each description is ladden with information that would be clear and helpful to one who has tango experience. Yet the novice is left floundering trying to make sense of it all. The editing is attrocious and only confuses the reader more with bad gramar and incorect syntax. Again, I can recomend this book to those who want to polish their steps and get a refined look to their dancing, but novices beware."
1,Quickstart to Tango,"Others who raved about this book must have had previous Tango experience to understand its instructions. As a complete newcomer to this dance, I found the book to be of little or no help. I'm sure Mr. Allen is a terrific teacher -- in person -- but his written instructions are nearly impossible for a novice to comprehend. I guess I shouldn't have expected to learn a complicated dance from a book. If you want to learn Tango basics, better to get a video!"
1,Elements of Style...in Dance but not in Writing,"This book is of use only to an intermediate to advanced dancer who already has a solid foundation in the steps, and some prior general knowledge of dance vocabulary and concepts. Overall very disappointing as book that will teach you to dance, but enjoyable to read about the subjective though processes involved in the dance.Instead of focusing on teaching the basic steps clearly, the author fills the book with dance theory, history, and conversations. A vexing aspect of this book is his writing style: the book is filled with meaningless repetition and vague 'artsy' expressions that would leave anyone but advanced dancers in the dark. This book is woefully inadequate for the beginner as it has no diagrams of foot placement, and far too few photographs to see the connection between each photograph that makes up any sequence."
5,The most intellegent explanation of creation I have read!,"I truly believe that the subjects used (astrology, Biology,embryology,physics.and so forth are expertly used and the excerpts from each area are used exactly where they should be.I have never read a more straight forward book! The author is very convinceing and his explanations are very believable.Our research class has backed up all of the writers statements.It is not an easy book to read but we certainly did not expect it to be.We are looking forward to reading his other books."
5,Beautiful journal,This is a fantastic journal for children. It offers great ideas for journaling and has nice pictures and is arranged in a delightful way. I am pleased with this purchase for our homeschooling family. It is a perfect addition for the Charolette Mason nature walks.
4,snowman named just bob,"It is a beautiful story with beautiful illustrations, but a little old for my preschoolers"
1,My Husband Bob,"My 46 year old husband, Bob, died suddenly the day after Thanksgiving, 2006. I had purchased this ""Bob"" book several years ago for him and he got misty-eyed when he read it. At the funeral home, I displayed the book with the last page showing that ""Bob is always near."" Both family and friends loved it so much, many of them have purchased the same book. I am buying 3 more books for our grandkids and will write a little note in it so they know how much Grandpa loved them and will always be around for them."

5,Right on the money,"Mr. Laermer and Mr. Prichinello's approach to explaining the ins and outs of the media is a terrific resource for learning about the ""PR World"" that exists out there that the average person is totally oblivious to. In a really accessible writing style you can become extremely savy yourself whether you use the information as general knowledge or if you employ some of their techniques in marketing yourself or your own business. I not only use this book in a University class that I teach on Media, but have also used their suggestions which have helped me to expand my law practice. It's a must buy book...JCH"
5,Nobody PR's it better,"If you, like me, believe strong PR is like warfare, you'll love Richard Laermer's book. Because this guy knows how to fight the battle and he lays out all the tools in accessible detail in this book. You'll have it full of underlines and highlighting and dog ears in no time."
5,Great Book,I am in the publicity biz and highly recommend this book. Richard Laermer is a PR pro who knows what the hell he's talking about.
3,Amyl Nitrate Overdrive,"Pros: About a quarter of this book is appropriate advice, such as the information on dealing with reporters.Cons: The examples in this book are lay-ups from the dot-com age where everyone in the PR business seemed to be on amyl nitrate overdrive and nothing made sense, particularly business sense.Examples from Chapter 4 in the book that appear ridiculous:a) Titles like: ""If It's Newsy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands""b) How Rosie O'Donnell recounted her lover's pregnancy on the Today show.c) How Arthur Shiff, an early proponent of the food stamp program in New York, started a publication ""City Family"" that would address immigrant problems and questions.My Advice: Concentrate 95 percent on making a great product. Those with great products generally win. Those with mediocre products and great PR generally lose."
5,"Funny, Informative...... and it adds to your bottom line....","This has to be one of the best books on Public Relations available. I have bought and read tens of PR books and this one was as much informative and full of juicy help as it was fun to read. Plus I bought it using a coupon from UnderTag.com, so it was a real bargain for me."
4,Burned to a crisp!,"Yet another example of Ms. Powell's scathing wit at play. The Angels in question are real Devils and whomever gets caught in their circle gets burned to a crisp. This is a witty tale of New York businessmen on the make, trying EVERY trick they know not to ""rock the boat"" with thier wives. Very entertaining read as you go along with these two rascals through their adventures. You will end up despising and envying them for all they get away with!"
4,A truly amazing video on 9/11,I'm from New York. Even seven years later this is still very hard to watch from an emotional point of view. What is unique about this video is that it is shot from street level by people experiencing the disaster as it happens. As such it has a truly terrifying level of reality. It really makes you feel that you are there. I've seen a lot of videos and news specials on this. Nothing compares with this video for realism.(How can people review a video that has not been released? It has already been shown on cable TV.)
5,Best look at history,This dvd was designed with no annoucers telling you what took place. It is just real Americans reacting to the disaster. Gives a very good picture of the events of the day.
1,Severely disappointed.....,"There was some amazing footage, but when I ordered this DVD, I was expecting to have some of the footage that was shown on TV that day and the following morning. Footage like the first airplane crashing into tower one, or one of several scenes of the second plane hitting tower two.The tail end of the first tower collapse was barely caught from an obscure point of view.I wanted to listen to the President's response shortly after the attack. I wanted to hear who was responsible, how the plan was executed, and who was involved.Overall I'm very disappointed with this dvd. It's almost like this footage is what was left over after all the major events were taken and copyrighted."
5,If youl ike June Christy & Chris Connor try Fran Warren...,"Just as June Christy came out of Stan Kenton's modern sounding band, Fran Warren came out of Claude Thornehill's very ahaed of it's time orchestra, she had two major hits during the forties with Thornehill ""A Sunday Kind Of Love"" and ""For Heaven's Sake."" This is an album with wonderful and very cool arrangements by Mel Torme's longtime arranger Marty Paich. Fran sounds cool and misty thoughout... and the song selection is mostly jazz standards. This CD comes highly recommeded to any swing era fan or jazz vocal collector. Highly Recommeded. Note: This also has the original LP cover artwork, always a plus."
4,Warren's warm misty vocals with Marty Paich's arrangements!,"A very nicely arranged LP, Fran Warren's warm misty vocals on jazz standards such as ""Bewitched"" match perfectly with Marty Paich's cool and slightly jazzy arrangements. Recommended"
4,An essential book for Julian May fans,"It has to be asked - is it necessary to add this book to your shelf? Do you really need another 'Readers Guide' type book?Well, if you're a fan of Julian May's sprawing 'Galactic Milieu' series, (a page-turning & adventurous retelling of 'Paradise Lost' long before Phillip Pullman thought to do it) and a member of the Julian May discussion group like I am, then the answer is a resounding ""you bet!""Alright, so it only covers the 'Exiles' part of the series (this book really needs an update) but the glossary is quite useful even if some of the entries are short, and the three interviews with the author are worth the price of the book by istself."
4,Super Reader,"For a fan of this series by Julian May, and I have read them many times, this is excellent. Lots of tidbits you may have missed when reading, too.This includes the information on the various different types of operant powers, the society of the Pliocene, as well as of the milieu and the technology that Marc Remillard manages to bring back."
3,Saddle Up!,For what?This album is not very good.The dark horse at the coffee shop is much better.but too dark.ok?
4,A double-sided single with great potential,"I have listened to this cd for hours now, and I can honestly say that both songs qualify as hit singles on their own. What a talented group they are! Wild Orchid is on their way to the big time!"
3,Huh?,"Half of the songs on this CD are good. Not great, just good. But the other half is really terrible, near amateurish. Feels like someone fiddling with a computer creating whatever sounds & music, nothing more. I really wonder why Taylor Savvy was proclaimed the #1 most influential personality in SHIFT magazine a couple of years ago."
3,"OK., for what it does, but....","Would seem to work for maintaining callouses...but to doubtful it would BUILD them. For that, get the ""Shred Neck""Shredneck Practice Guitar Neck Black. But the ""Ruff Rider"" IS light and small (A bit TOO small..) for carrying around.Somebody could probably make a fortune by making a ""Shred Neck"" where you could hear the strings (would have to be electronically, as there's no body to resonate), then you'd know if chord fingering were off. Obviously, it would be more costly (than mid-$40's), but what a boon it would be for someone who wanted to practice and carry a device (for same) that would fit in a small case!But for wht is does, the ""Ruff Rider"" has value."
2,"Not actually ""Compatable with all iPods except 1G and 2G""","This product is described as a ""Data/Charge"" cable that is ""Compatable with all iPods except 1G and 2G"". It did not take long for me to discover that this was incorrect... all I had to do was look at the package, it clearly says ""Data sync only with 3G iPod"". I purchased this item for a customer that wanted to charge his 3G iPod on his new laptop that did not have a mini-firewire port. The product description for this item seems to indicate that it would charge a 3G iPod since they are ""compatable"" but it definitely does not. Buyer beware."
5,Breathe Breathe,"After reading this book, I immediately bought three copies, one for each of my adult children. Having read it and practicing these techniques, I find I will never again be so unaware of my own breath."
5,All Dance Band Music Was Regional,"While the late 20's and early 30's yielded some national orchestal artists like Paul Whiteman, Coon-Sanders Nighthawks, Isham Jones and Casa Loma, much of the dance band scene was a regional affair on radio and on records. This album is a nice document of some of these territory bands. Most notable by virtue of later success is Kay Kyser (listen to a very young Sully Mason on vocals). This was produced by TOM on CD-R instead of a commercially pressed CD."
3,Assigned Reading,My son read this book as an assignment for his ASL class. He found it to be dry and not as comprehensive regarding deaf culture as he would have liked.
2,great potential...lost,"I bought this CD as a gamble -- ""You're too late, Satan"" by Worm Is Green is a personal favorite but it's not available on CD (right now download only) so I bought Automagic and hoped for the best. Well, like the last reviewer, I felt most tracks were mediocre. The cover of Joy Division's ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" takes some getting used to, but works. I also liked ""Drive Thru"" despite the fact that it is extremely repetitious and I totally understand why the last reviewer disliked it. Overall this group has great potential, needs to use the female vocalist more in the same way they did on ""You're too late, Satan."""
2,"Novice effort, but shows potential","Please, before you buy this album, listen to the samples. KCRW recommended this on their Broadband progam, so I bit...and twelve bucks later was very disappointed.There are some bright spots, such as tracks 3 and 10, but there are many very, very cheezey cuts. Most of the vocals are, well, just awful. The male vocals are painful...no, agonizing. Witness Tracks 8 and 9. I just don't understand what the other reviewer was thinking.The kid has potential. Let him grow up a bit before you buy this album and don't spoil him."
5,Exactly what it says it is,"Its a pretty basic peice of hardware, but was hard to find. It does exactly what it says, so overall I'm pretty satisfied. I'm using mine to plug my xbox 360 to my monitor, works fine. If you have a use for it, I recommend it."
3,Romance,"Mason just drowns the story in sex. I didn't finish it. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
3,Could have been better...,"I'm a big fan of Connie Mason, however, I found this book to be so so. There is a good plot but I think it gets drawn out unnecessarily. In my opinion, there are too many ""just in the nick of time"" moments and too many ""coincidences"". I like romance to have some minute element of believability. My biggest complaint about the book was that there was a lot of unnecessary sex. These people went far beyond the expectations of most rabbits I know. If that had been toned down and the love element more played up, I would have enjoyed the book a great deal more. Still it does have appeal if you're into the oregon trail time period."
2,Not a great book!,"Beyond the Horizon is a boring and disappointing book. I didn't like the heroine. She was just too perfect. The hero is a little better, but just when it seems that I could like him, he does or says something stupid. This is Indian romance at its least exciting. I'm given it a 3, because it does have its moments."
5,Beyond the horizon,"As usual, I love ALL of Connie Mason' s books and this one is no exception...I have a hard time putting one down...So plan your day, so you can spend the day reading."
4,I Would Really give this book an 8.5,"This is a great book. If you want the other two Star Wars novels as well, get ""The Star Wars Trilogy.""I love this book's prologue about the fall of the Republic and Senator Palpatine's rise-to-power."
3,Good but...,"This book was great and all, but it doesn't have much of a plot, and the words robots were frequently used, more than needed. Overall, this was okay."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"This is definitely a fun book, and I used to be able to do quite a bit of quoting from the material in my younger days.The one thing that we used to wonder 'why' about, was why was Luke Red 5 in one, and Blue 5 in the other. One of the mysteries of the universe.Definitely a good read though."
3,You need to know,"Before you read this book you need to know two things. One, although the cover says ""By George Lucas"" this book was NOT written by Lucas but by a hired author. Two, the book was released six months before the movie, so it is based on the unfinished cut and includes deleated scenes and some minor changes such as red-five to blue-five. It even suggests R2D2 having arms. This book novelizes the movie very well and is enjoyable, but I stoped reading it at the halfway point myself. Although well done, it isnt much more than a script of the movie when it comes to dialogue and plot."
2,"Need not read the book, the movie is exactly the same (and in color!)","O.K. here's the deal. Star Wars is a good story. I had to read this book for Young Adult. No problem right? So, I read it and it was alright (I remember seeing the movie a few years back); it was as I remembered the movie. In fact, after reading the book, I went back and watched the movie. Exactly the same. That's when I got mad! Oh well, we live and learn."
1,Needed book for a class,I just needed this book for a class it is not something I would purchase otherwise. The book came in a timely manner to my doorstep. It was in good condition and very cheap.
4,worth getting from the rafi track alone!,"because its a good recording and not so easy to find on cd where you can keep it on repeat for a couple hours. It's well put together and cohesive, despite the all-encomapssing from qvaali to 'new age' interludes or whatever style that's called, to dance tracks and the old stuff, but some tracks I usually skip over, and some get on me for a day or so (chunari chunari) and then kind of leave me sick like eating too many cookies or something. Overall, it's great, and you can enjoy it for a while. Often I'm finding one song on a certain time that I just want to hear for a while."
5,Marigoldtic!,the music is incredibly beautiful and rich in culture.a wonderful cd.one cannot help but dance around their home playing the dancing scores.love it!!
5,Overwhelming Flavor,"This is one of very few movies I sat till the last of the end credits rolled up. Sukhwinder Singh's end-theme - 'Today my heart desires', simply refused to let go.Rest of the album is equally captivating, also being terrifically vivacious and vibrant. ""Love and Marigolds"" is one of my favorites on the disk.The only problem I have with the album is the so-sparse description of the artists on various songs. The disk in-lay could have maybe used some of the space dedicated to the director's commentary to better describe the musicians."
5,"Spicy, lively, and sweet golden music","When I watched the film, I found myself drawn to return to it again and again. I realized it was the music that worked like a magnet; I was entranced. The soundtrack is so rich; think of eating a whole box of See's candy (nuts and chews), only without the guilt and calories. There is the traditional Indian fare, saturated in ethnic rhythms and the sitar. Contrast these traditional tunes with the contemporary techno treatments and they reflect the heat and sun of a day in Delhi. Then, there are the lilting and haunting melodies that evoke heavy and humid nights when it is too hot to sleep. Think about sitting on the porch at midnight while it is pouring ten feet beyond. Cheers..."
4,An invitation to an Indian wedding.....,"This is a must for all those who saw the movie and enjoyed the music. For me, the movie brought back memories of Delhi where I grew up and the ""baraats"" that used to go down my street every night, with the requisite campy music played by a brass band.Watching Mira Nair's film was like being invited to a Punjabi wedding, and better still, getting to know all the juicy details of everyone's secret lives. The music was very appropriate to the mood of the film. ""Aaj Mera Jee..."" was my favorite, closely followed by ""Fabric/Aaja Savariya.."" where the soulful voice of a wonderful Hindustani classical singer floats over the synthesizer melody....very well done."
3,Incomplete,"One of the nice songs that I really I enjoyed listening to was a old ghazal ""Aaj Jaane Ji Zid Na Karo"". I was very dissapointed not to see that one on the CD. Since most of the music is remixed from old Hindi songs the music is not much of a surprise. But the compliation and the remix are decent, so you can enjoy it even if you have heard the original."
4,Great buy.. could have been better.,I am not sure why my earlier review did not show up on Amazon. Here I go again..This is a great CD which gives you a high level musical menagerie of the music from North Indian states.Excellent recording which makes a BIG difference. Plays very well utilizing distinct six channels (Am I imagining things..).The best track is Sukhwinder's Aaj mera jee karda. Very danceable. Mychael Danna did ruin it a bit by giving it a classical ending.Go get it.
4,Really Good Soundtrack,Saw the Film&thought it was Pretty Good but the Music left a more lasting impression on me.really was a strong mixture of the Past&Modern Sound.really Good Combination of Sound&Feel.
3,Doesn't resonate,"Looking at the little buying nudges provided by amazon, I see that many purchasers of the 'Monsoon Wedding' soundtrack followed the same path as me:- Saw 'Bend It Like Beckham.' Loved the movie. Bought the CD.- Loved the CD.- Saw 'Monsoon Wedding.' Loved the movie. Bought the CD.That's where my tales ends. Unlike the Beckham collection - with its hypnotic tracks from Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Gunjan and B21 - there's nothing that resonates on the 'Monsoon Wedding' soundtrack. I've force-fed myself this CD a dozen times and just haven't latched on to it. I can appreciate that others find it a wonderful listening experience. It's just not going to have the widespread appeal of 'Beckham' Director Gurinder Chadha's exquisitely constructed compilation."
4,Better and truer version of the story,"This version is much more engaging and factual than the more recent version. Excellent acting and screenplay. The only criticism I have is that the quality of the video is not too high, not altogether surprising since it was made more than 20 years ago."
3,C.S. Lewis's Love Story,I expected C.S. Lewis's full life history showing his Christan Philosophy. This was just short part of his life related to his love and merrigage.
5,A True and Moving Portrait,I found this film far superior to the one featuring Anthony Hopkins which pretty much ignored the influence Christianity had on Lewis and his impact on the Christian world..Very Inspirational and Insightful..I have watched it five times...
3,not met expectation,It's a good movie but it just didn't met my expectation.I was looking more for an in depth biography that's probably why.
4,Atomic Rooster - 'Heavy Soul: The Anthology' (Castle) 2-CD,"I've seen this item in retail stores before. As I took a look at the thirty tracks featured on this 2-CD title, I noticed that 'Heavy Soul' didn't include the usual songs that most Atomic Rooster compilations do have. No wonder I didn't immediately recognize many of these songs. This 2-CD pressing features four (4) tunes from Rooster's first five (5) lp's, 1970-1973. It was good to hear the heavy hitters, like ""Winter"", the almost sinister ""Friday The 13th"", the rocking ""Tomorrow Night"", ""Death Walks Behind You"", ""Head In The Sky"", ""Time Take My Life"" and ""Can't Find A Reason"" once again. Heard that some label put out a DVD or two of this under-appreciated UK heavy rock entity."
1,Couldnt Play the Game,"Needing a patch to install the game infuriated me. Finally installed , I found that the CD key was invalid. Great- Garbage!What ever happened to quality control?Try again Dreamcatcher."
1,A Waste of Time / A Waste of Money,"Oh My God did I waste $40 on this so called game. Go around blow up ships and shoot down planes and if your lucky you will blow up a submarine. Every map is the same, every mission is the same. Shoot ships, shoot plane, depth charge submarines you can't see. Only semi-cool thing is the voice activated commands, but that gets boring quickly becasue you say the same things over and over and over and they don't even have sound bytes to say ""Aye, Aye Sir""; they use text. I bought it becasue I thought there would be more FPS and I would also get to be in the planes. Boats and subs thats all you command. ZZZZzzzz! Save your money. For $40 I expected sound bytes explaining the missions too. But why should they when they are all the same. No story line, what a sleeper. Obviously with 7 companies envolved making this 1 of them would have done something right. I never should have left CS and BHD."
4,Great game but some glitchs,"Very good game play, but you have to make sure you have the exact system requirements and having more would be better. The CD key is a little piece of paper in the box not the case! we have an OK computer but my brother had to download alot of stuff to get it to work and even after that we still have to reinstall it sometimes. The controls are hard to get used to and don't get frustrated if you die alot on your first 5 missions. It has really good graphics and alot of missions, really fun. You can be Germany, US, and Britain/Japanese (I still don't know whats with that). Really fun, a must buy!"
1,"Buggy, CTD problems",If you want to buy this make double-sure you have the exact hardware needed to play this as I have a 'decent' machine to play this on and I continuously had problems. I did manage to finally start a patrol after several attempts and game crashes and all the graphics were just grey rectangles. The squared and seemingly huge pixel rain that seems to be constantly filling the screen was a bit annoying. There were other windows related problems after I installed the game. Cut scenes did look nice. The concept looks great but fails in execution.
2,"Great idea, however. . . .","The chain continues to come off the track and the last time this happened (like the third time I tried to use it), the chain got tangled up. I now have a useless tool. Concept is great, actual item is not."
5,Very happy with this pole saw,For the price you cannot get better than this pole saw. When I have to reach a branch that is very high I just use a ladder and this gets me where I need to be. Great little saw.
4,ok,"1st, dismantle the poorly engineered safety trigger, then ignore instructions on how to tighten chain, you will see a better way, then it does well on soft woods where reach is needed, light weight and motor has enough power"
3,Remington RMO612P 6-inch pole saw,"I was under the impression that this extended to a reach of 12 feet, it does if you are 6 feet tall, but if you're avarage height as myself,""5'8, this is not possible.I think this should have been stated, had it been, I wouldn't have ordered it. I emailed my dis-satisfaction to Amazon. They allowed me to return it for a full refund, to their credit, they back their commitments.I extend my apology to Amazon for the email I sent."
5,Just what I needed...,Most of the trees in Arizona have thorns so this is perfect for trimming them without getting stuck. Easy to use!
2,Disappointed,"I had hoped the saw could be disconnected from the pole to work on its own similar to the Remington 8"" polesaw model. The pole is not telescopic. I found it difficult to see where I was cutting when fully stretched."
3,Not For Florida Palms,"Would have given it four stars, but item is not long enough to trim dead leaves from Florida palm trees and it's ""tip/head"" is heavy. Must have good balance on ladders and strength to hold up saw to properly get at palm leaves. Tends to need constant adjustments due to the palm fibers."
1,"Arrived damaged, non-functioning","The item arrived damaged. The plastic casing was broken but there were no pieces in the box or in the plastic bag that the motor piece was in, didn't look like a UPS problem to me. My opinion is it was poor quality control by Amazon. Refund was handled promptly. The only hitch was I did not get a $5 promotional credit put back in my account for future use, it was just gone. Disappointing... Oh, I have since purchased another one of these, differnent model, and it works great!"
5,Finally-A tool that works as advertised!,Used the saw today for the first time. Excellent cut and handling. Ease of use is very nice and really has powerful cut for such a small saw. Worth twice the price. Early yet to see how it holds up. Very safe if the instructions are followed.Saw chain and bar is readily available from Home Centers such as Lowes and H Depot.
4,A book for dog lovers,"This is a book about a boy named Curtis and his brother Mitch.Their mom and dad get a divorce. Curtis really wants a dog and his mom finally gives in. Curtis got a black dog named Sammy andhe loved it and it loved him.They went to his dads apartment and no pets where allowed. So his mom brings them home and Sammy bites everyone,so they wanted to take him back. What will happento Curtis and Sammy?I really enjoyed this book because I love dogs very much. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves dogs. What really made me enjoy this book was when Sammy chewed on Curtis' shoe. Another reason I enjoyed this because dogs are so cute when they are puppies."
2,Not a great choice for my family....,"I have to agree that this topic and the sad ending of the story might be of value to specific kids, but in general this book didn't go over well in our house.As a very sensitive animal lover, my daughter didn't handle the ending well at all. We've read other books by this author that were great, and I'm sorry I trusted that her book would be appropriate for my daughter without reading it first.This story has a sad ending, with not much to ""hope"" for, and a couple of pages at the end from a dog handler about how the family made some poor choices. Maybe this moral stuff works for older kids, but not for my 1st grader. Pass on this one if your child has any trouble at all with sad endings."
4,Informative and Entertaining,"I bought this book with the idea of finding out more of the types of relationships women shared at the beginning of the twentieth century. I was astonished to find more than I bargained for. The Red Rose Girls provided more than insight into these relationships, it also provided a look inside the rise and fall of the progressive and arts and crafts movements. Pre Freud, the relationship of these woman was accepted and cherished as they lived together, and created their art. Post Freud, their relationships deteriorated as did their careers. All in all I found this book extremely entertaining, as well as heartening (a forty year relationship between two of the women) and the pictures are absolutely beautiful. If nothing else, as an art book it is extraordinary."
5,Great book about artists and friendship...,"Some great reproductions here too, of some Pre-Raphaelite-style art from the Philadelphia area about 100 years ago. Violet spent over 25 years painting huge celebrations of the founding of Pennsylvania in the Harrirburg State Capitol. She may not ne Michaelangelo, but is not far behind his Sistine Chapel! This small coffee table book will never go out of style, and does a great job bringing back 3 great lady artists!"
2,Latter Day Lillian,"I have to disagree with the other reviewers. As a lover of 1920's and 30's torch singers, I was very disappointed in this CD. I am familiar with Lillian Roth's singing from the movies she made in the early 30's, and hoped to find 1930's recordings on this CD. Unfortunately, this recording was originally done in 1957, with 1950's arrangements. Lillian sounds fine, but doesn't have the tear in her voice that she had in the 30's. If you're looking for a young Lillian singing original arrangements of standards, this is not the CD for you."
5,It hurts so good,"This little gem will hurt a bit, I won't lie. But if you have those nasty little tension knots up your spine, nothing but extreme pressure will work them out. No pain, no gain is absolutely true in this instance. A few minutes a day and you will be pretty knot free."
4,Good tool for back pain!,"I have chronic back pain and am always looking for tools to help me at home. I heard about this one from my sister and was eager to try it. As many of the other reviews state, it takes some getting used to. It is hard and wooden and requires that you position it correctly so your spine is centered on it and when you find a sore spot stay there and rest for a minute if possible before finding the next spot. It is sort of a trigger point muscle relaxer without the masseuse. The relaxation comes After you use the roller :)"
4,Dolphin Diaries - Review 2,This makes a great gift for pre-teens. The level of readability is easy and the subject interesting.The shipping was very quick (faster than indicated) and made it on time for a birthday surprise.
1,Would not load,The box says compatible for windows98/me/200/xp. I have windows xp and could not get any of the games to load. One of the games in the box Message in a Haunted Mansion was for windows 98/95.
3,Okay - but I could use one thing....,"I just got this book today and I'm on my second spin thru it. What I've come to realize is that I'd find it so much more helpful if the book included pics of rooms w/the actual colors in each palette.Otherwise, it's okay. I probably wouldn't have paid $20 for it if I'd been able to flip thru it first at a bookstore."
5,Just What I Was Looking For,"After seeing the price at the bookstore, I knew I could get a bargin through Amazon.com and I was right."
2,Dissappointed,Was really looking forward to this book as all the reviews were so positive. My wife and I wanted to get some color scheme ideas for our new house. Unfortunately i just was not that impressed with the schemes laid out in the 'bible'.
2,"not bad, but not that useful to me","I didn't find this book to be very useful. It's got a lot of color schemes, but for some reason I didn't really like any of them. Why, I don't know, but there you have it."
2,Ready made solutions for you,"This book gives you a large number of (trendy) ready made palettes all with kitchy names (some might find the names inspiring). Pick one palette, apply and you're done. Not bad if that is what you are looking for, but I found it quite limiting.If you are looking for something in more depth I can recommendChoosing Colors: An Expert Choice of the Best Colors to Use in Your Home. Its palettes have a larger number of colours so you get more flexibility in choosing. That whole books has a more serious tone and content. Its palettes come from nature or historical time so they are not necessarily trendy. Just bear in mind that using this book is going to be much more time consuming since there are so many choices. The benefit is hopefully going to be a more unique design.It all depends on what kind of person you are and how much time you can devote to colour choices! Good luck!"
3,Colour combination chart in spiral book form with hard cover,A book that is more for carrying around when colour schemes are being planned. It is small in size. Each page has an imaginative and inspiring title that distinguishes one combination of colour from another. It does not have many interior design photographic examples of the combinations suggested. It is like a palette with suggestions.
2,Scheme to sell books,This book was very disappointing because it did not show how to use the colors. The pages were full of words and a few blocks of color. I am a visual person and was hoping there would be photographic examples of how to use the color schemes in actual rooms. For the most part. I did not like the color schemes that were described. I would return the book but it would cost more than the book is worth - I will donate it (or burn it)!
1,BORING!,"Quite simply, this toy is boring. Just something else for you to step on. Doesn't hold my child's interest for even a minute. Waste of money."
1,Stackers don't stack up!,"I bought these for my 12 month old and they DO NOT stack at all. I found this toy to be pointless and a waste of money. He is now 17 months and still does not enjoy this toy. Sometimes he will pick up one of the little pieces, but looses interest very fast. If you're buying this product for stacking, I recommend you look elsewhere. If you are buying this toy just to have random little pointless pieces.....LOOK NO FURTHER!"
3,Just okay...,Our son (9 months) received the Brightlings Builders for Christmas this year and he plays with them every once in a while. They are bigger than I pictured them when looking on the internet. Our son really only likes the pieces that make some sort of noise...the others he could care less for. Maybe he will like them more when he is older. Our three year old did not care for these at all.
2,Not for compact fluorescent bulbs,"If you are using compact fluorescent bulbs, this is not the switch you want. The lights flicker and it burns out the bulbs prematurely. If you are (and always will be) using incandescent it may suit your needs."
2,"Not Easy, Fun, or Quick","I thought this would be a great way to make a gift... but, the kit did not have the tool needed... so I had to go find one (not that easy). I got very frustrated with this until I got into a rhythm, but still took longer and was tougher than expected. Ran out of the blue color, so had to improvise some. I don't recommend this for a first time user, maybe a more skilled user would find this Easy, Fun, and Quick."
3,Broad but not deep,"This compilation is quite good but doesn't quite reach deep enough to stay in my CD player for more than one listen every now and then. If you like to use trance music as background for other activities Trance Psyberdelic is fine, inobtrusive and consistently driven. Unfortunately, it's a bit flat on its own--cranking the volume only accentuates its weaknesses. Good work from all the artists, but the album as a whole never quite achieves liftoff. The last track, ""Space Puppy,"" is the strongest and I look forward to more from that artist."
2,exasperating rather than inventive,"Unlike Dean Young, who blurbs this book with enthusiasm, Catherine Wing's brand of manic wordplay and surreal humor doesn't, by and large, succeed. Although capable of satisfying cleverness and deep imginative leaping, Wing's poetry is ultimately frustrating. Regardless of where one falls on the spectrum of experimental versus traditional poetry, Wing's incoherence is amplified by the large dose of her that a book-length project offers. Read Wing in small doses; seek out her work in magazines. Skip the book."
5,Very informative... I learned a lot!,"I remember when I bought my first organic product... a gallon of organic skim milk; I was 6 months pregnant and my childbirth educator suggested I eat organically to improve my health and the health of my baby. I was so afraid of the way it was going to taste... it took me a few days before I even had the courage to taste it, but when I finally did pour myself a cold class, I was stunned to find out it tasted exactly the same! Was it the same... no... it offered the same nutrients and calories, but it was missing all the hormones and antibiotics that are ingredients in regular milk. Now I try to buy organically when I can, which has lead to trying to find more ways to live a healthier, greener life; `One Day on the Organic Farm' has been an excellent way to learn these ways... everything from farming and composting, to foraging and using green energy... it really is packed full of great green ideas!"
5,Content is king,"Content is king, this has some good info, you can learn a lot watching this DVD. It's made on a day on the farm, not Hollywood set. You will hear the wind, and kids in the back ground. Made by a non profit.. so no high paid staff, all donated their time to get content and got it. learn many tips from real people that did not get paid to talk or are selling something. again great content.To be fair, I must add to this review, that I help out the non profit that has this product. I enjoy what they do, The Gifted Learning Project."
3,The songs listed are not the songs on the CD,"I was looking for a specific Everybodyduck CD one with Susie's Diet, Shags Has Hung Himself, Family Man and those songs are not on this CD. That is the song list in the product description- not what I received. My husband, who passed away in 05 had some connection to one of the band members at Southwestern College in Phoenix, AZ and I wanted to share said songs with my current boyfriend. With that being said, I like Everybodyduck, listened to the CD and it's good music - just not what I thought I was getting."
1,Edens - Not,I was very disappointed with the content of this DVD. I wanted to give this to friends as an introduction to Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is a geologic wonder but the DVD never touches on the those incredible and varied aspects of the park. It never gets past the animal food chains reflected in the park so most of the DVD is devoted to one species devouring another. This is a DVD that parents will want to review before letting young children see it.
3,Not for children or sensitive viewers,"This program is not an overview of Yellowstone; rather, it is a brutally honest examination of the predator-prey relationships among the park's wildlife. The numerous hunt scenes are neither sensationalized nor censored. Sensitive viewers should be prepared to see cute baby animals killed. The theme is the dichotomy of nature's beauty vs. the animals' constant struggle to survive.If the subject matter does not put you off, then I recommend the program. The cinematography is beautiful, and the narration is interesting. Proponents of wolf conservation will be particularly interested in this documentary because wolves are featured throughout.No special features, language selection, or subtitles are included. I have given the DVD 3 stars (neutral) to reflect my suspicion that most viewers will either love it or hate it."
4,Better than Uggs!!!,I just got these a couple of weeks ago & love them!!! I had pink Uggs last year & they got all faded & worn. These are very warm & comfy!! They do run a little small. I usually take a 7-7.5 & had to order a size 8. And for the price you can own 2 pairs for the price of 1 pair of Uggs!! I love these so much I just got a short pair too!!
5,Style queen,These boots are just perfect for the tween queen they shod. She is quick to point out that the fashion trend is well filled with these boots. Soft fabric interiors and a comfortable fit...are two factors that convince me to buy more...
2,"Bearpaw 10"" boot","Although this boot appeared to be well made and I loved the look, it was difficult to put on. Once it was on, the boot fit very tight around the ankle which is unusual for me. The foot section fit fine, therefore a bigger size would not have been a good fit. I was disappointed but it was necessary to send this boot back."
3,Don't compare to Uggs!,"Don't buy these as an alternative to Uggs if you are expecting the same quality. These are worth their price, as long as you don't compare them to Uggs. They were stiffer than I expected from boots of this material, with the inside material being a bit scratchy. My chocolate ones also faded and showed wear in certain spots more quickly than I expected them to. They were tight at first when I got them in my usual size 6, but they quickly stretched out to fit. The boot heel was stiff and rubbed against my heel, even when I wore socks. I liked the height of the boots, coming to my lower/mid-calf. I was able to tuck in my skinny jeans, with some effort required. For the price, they were passable. With waterproof suede protector, they were able to keep my feet warm and dry. The next time I buy this kind of boot, I will pass on these and put in the extra money for boots of a higher quality."
4,Bearpaw Women's Boots,"I really like the shoes but after I wore them about two or three times the seams at the toe came apart and at the top as well. It didn't effect the boots though it was just kind of annoying to cut off the little strings. Other than that, the boots are great and really really comfy and warm. (:"
5,Great value,"A pair of winter boots were long due. I couldn't decide which one to buy without proper reviews. I bought this product after my cousin told me about it. Apparently she had been using it since 2 winters and was very happy with it so I decided to go for it.Please make sure that you go for the next higher size(I am a 8 1/2 so went for 9). These are very very cozy, comfortable and great value for the money. Only qualm is that the fur from its inside kept peeling off the first few days of using it make my white sock dirty:("
2,Dissapointing,"For all of you thinking about buying these boots; do your feet a favor and skip it. Looks really pretty and it's made out of really good quality materials. But has a major flaw; the sole is terrible. You can feel the sole because the wool bed covering it is very thin and feels like you're walking on little rubber pads. Very uncomforable. But worst of all, the heel does not have any support at all. You're heels will be screaming in pain after a few hours of using it. I bought pads, lots of pads but it didn't make a difference. Now they are just stuck on the very back of my shoe closet."
1,Horrible Winter Boots,I bought these boots in North Dakota. At first they were great but 6 weeks later after being outside for 5 min my feet are freezing and wet. Horrible winter boots for places that actually experience winter. I expected them to last longer than 6 weeks. Of course Bearpaw won't do anything about it because they aren't in new condition. Don't waste your money.
4,Nice Winter Boots,"These boots are super comfy and squishy! They are like wearing slippers...in fact, I've been known to use them around the house as slippers! There were some unexpected issues with them. I wear a 8 1/2 and ordered a 9. Still, it felt like my toes were pushing against the front of the boot and there was room in the heel. I don't know if that means that these boots were a size too big or too small or what. Wearing thick socks helps them fit better. Also, wool socks keep your feet warmer with the wool shearling inside, rather than cotton socks. And the leg is so snug that you really can only tuck in tight skinny jeans or leggings, not regular pants. All in all, though, they are cozy and pretty cute and have great tread on the bottom."
1,Sizing is way off,"These boots are sized wrong. My size 10 foot--sometimes a 9 1/2--couldn't make the turn into the foot of the boot. Since this was considered a buyer's error, I would have been charged a fee to return them. I gave them to a size 8 wearing pal."
3,Bearpaw Boots,"The boots are beautiful, but I would have liked to know that the sizes are a little small. The size 6 feels more like a 5 1/2. I bought the boots to wear to Germany, but couldn't wear wool socks with the boots without discomfort. They'll be ok without socks here in no-snow California.Linda"
5,Great alternative to Uggs,"I just bought a pair of these 10"" Dream 405 style from shoe pavilion today for $39.99. I think they are so great and comfortable! I tried on the 160 Uggs ultra short earlier in the day, which looks almost the same, and guess what? BearPaw Dream is even more comfortable than Uggs' ultra short since ultra short feels a little too tight. Uggs' classic short ($120) is still the most comfortable tho, but its style, which is more rounded and doesn't have a 2nd line around the edges, is a little outta date.These BearPaw Dreams serve as a great alternative to the new Uggs ultra short. Its shaft is a little taller than Uggs as well, which I think is smart because then it looks better with pants tugged in.Caution: if you wear 1/2 sizes, go one size up. Don't expect these comfortable shoes to have bigger rooms inside. I used to wear 6 or 6.5.. but I have to return a pair and get a 7."
5,Amazing boots!,"I ordered these boots on Amazon because I was looking for an affordable, comfortable and attractive shearling boot. This more than exceeded my expectations and they are super durable. They are great in the snow with just a little waterproofing spray and are comfortable enough to wear all day long. They feel comparable to a pair of slippers. An excellent buy!"
4,Not very comfortable,"The look and quality are fine, especially at this price.But the calf is kinda tight. I can only tuck in leggings and some skinny jeans, was never able to tuck regular jeans in."
3,Nice but........,"They sent the wrong style. Should have received ""405 Dream"". Got ""410"". They are similar but different. Exchanging is a real pain, and at my expense so I kept them. I wear a 7. Got a 7. They fit just fine. They are warm and cozy. Could be a bit better cushioned on the soles. Good buy for the price."
4,Only a four because they run big!,"These boots are as comfortable as slippers and so cute! I can't take them off! My only advice is this: if you wear a 1/2 size, order down. I wear a solid 9.5, so I ordered a 10 but they are way too big (not to mention that they will stretch out over time). I got the black boots and they look identical to Uggs. Definitely worth the money!"
4,Well made boots,Boots are a little stiff but I assume they will soften as they are worn more. Also a little snug even though I sized up 1/2 size. For the price I would recommend them. Nice and warm inside.
5,BearPaw,These boots are wonderful! Most comfortable and cozy. Will definitely buy another pair. Arrival time was great too.
4,tight around calf,I bought a pair for my daughter and loved them so decieded to purchase a pair for myself. I loved the boot but it was to tight around my calf. If you have muscular calves or are a little heavy these boots will not fit.Other wise they are a cheaper alternative to Uggs and look great
2,had to return them,one of the boots was defective.the structure of this boot is not good.it folds near the ankle area
1,size is wrong,"As of November 16, 2010 , I ordered 1 of Bearpaw Women's M405-W Dream 10"" Boot,Nutmeg,8 M US. Though contained in the original packaging, the content was a completely different size.So I'd like to return this one since it is not the one that I wanted. I want 8 size. Why packaging is 7 size!!Delivery from Korea. And A delivery cost are your charged please."
4,Good Purchase,"I was really happy when I received these boots. I'd been wanting them for awhile. The price wasn't that bad either. However, I ended up ordering the wrong size so I had to return them. :( But if not for that I would've have def. kept them."
4,Bear Paws,These bear paws are awesome and very reasonable in price. They last a good while and I can tromp through the snow in them! These are great shoes.
5,Great value,"I am an UGG lover but on a Payless budget. I bought the Bearpaws not expecting much since they were under $40 and boy was I pleasantly surprised! I have several pairs of UGGS and honestly I can't tell the difference. I now own 3 pairs of Bearpaws and could live in them. They do run a tad large, but then again, so do the Uggs. So warm, so cozy and very, very comfortable.Amazon was amazing, got the boots exactly when they said they'd arrive and in a very timely manner."
4,"Great Boots, great price!","These were a great buy, I purchased 2 pairs on sale. One in the black and a pair in the Nutmeg. They look like the real deal. Would have gotten 5 stars but fit just a tad too snug."
4,Good value for price,"I bought these boots for my 13 year old daughter. She loves them and says they are very warm and comfortable. It's true that when purchasing, you need to go down one size. She normally wears a size nine and I bought 8's. They were snug for the first couple of wears but have molded to her foot and now fit comfortably. She's only had them for a month though so I can not comment on durability. Delivery was prompt and overall I am very pleased."
5,love them,These boots are so warm and soft! I usually wear a 7.5 and I ordered them in size 7 (even though they recommend sizing up for half sizes) and they fit perfectly. An awesome (and cheaper) alternative to Uggs.
5,Bearpaw Boots,"This product was great, the fur inside stays puffy and warm! The tread makes them seem like real ugs & I think it was a great buy."
4,great boots,"Was searching different sites for good warm weather boots, and found these to be the best price, all real materials and exatly what i wanted. Definately worth it."
5,Very Comfy!,"I got these for three reasons: They were part of Amazon's one day sale for $30, I had heard that they were very comfy, and I'll admit that I wanted them because pretty much everyone else has them (or uggs or some other version of them). Well, I don't know what uggs feel like, but these feel amazing and are worth every penny! I would buy them for the comfort and warmth alone regardless of their looks, but I actually do like how they look too. I normally wear a size 9 1/2 and I went up to a size 10 and they fit perfectly. This is a great buy and I would definitely recommend them!"
5,Love IT :),This is exactly what i want for the winter.....it is soooooo warm that you can wear um without socks.Money totally worth it.i am size 7.5 but 8 fits me perfect.
3,Not Satisfied SELLER NEVER responded!!!,"I wrote to this seller as soon as I received the boots, requesting a different size and how I return them and NO response at all!!!! Will never buy from them again."
4,"Comfy, comfy, comfy!","These boots are soooo comfortable. My only complaint is that I bought them in ""sand"" and they are closer to light pink. It depends on what light I'm in. I wanted a shade darker but they were sold out. All in all, I'd pry buy them again."
1,THEY SENT ME THE WRONG ONE,"I ordered a dark brown 12 in boot and they sent me an ankle length sand colored boot. This is ridiculous, do not order from them."
5,Helen is original work with a new spin on the technogeek com,"Helen is a great comic, and the book is a reflection of that. Helen combines the techno geek aspect that's common in a lot of online comics with a more realistic twist. It gives a view of a reality we'd all like to live in. Helen is best in her role as omniscient computer god. Someone makes her mad in an airport?, she cancels their flight with her laptop. Helen is truly a wonder of the information age. Buy the book it's a great start on the Helen experience."
1,Nightmare,"If you want to store contact information, using the old pen and paper is better than ACT! We have an ACT database storing roughly 3,000 contacts. It is EXTREMELY slow. Integration with Outlook 2000 or 2003 (havent tried xp) is just about inoperable. I recommend that if you have to the tools and knowledge to create your own contact database, do it. It can then be tailored exactly to how the user needs it."
1,Complete Junk - SAVE YOUR MONEY,"One word for the latest ACT - TRASH.Email stinks, mailmerge is week. Can't even sort contacts by creation date. Slow. Poor integration to Palm OS.What a JOKE. I have been using ACT for 10 years which is about the last time they really did anything with this product.Oh and forget technical support. There is NONE."
1,i am switching from this junk,I have used ACT for three years and have a huge investment in the data it holds but I am moving to Lotus after trying to use this newest version. IT IS JUNK. I stayed with ACT waiting for a decent email interface hoping that it would make the product usable again. Alas it was not to be.
1,Bugs Bugs Bugs,"I purchased ACT 6.0.3 because I used 5.0 and loved it. Wow, what a mistake. I installed it on my brand new laptop and the problems began. Freeze after freeze left me feeling cold and frustrated. If you can make it through to tech support without paying $29.00 you're lucky. Here's a hint...make sure you tell them it's a new install!Tech support tried everything to resolve the problem, but to no avail. I was left with these empty words when there was nothing else to try, ""You must have a virus"".Ok, a virus on a brand new Dell laptop with only factory installed software that has never connected to the Internet.Here is my suggestion to the makers of this product...""Get your ACT together!"""
2,I'm out!,I was using ACT for several years. No considerable complaints with ACT6. But when I upgraded to ACT!7 I was very suprised by its performance. I spent a lot of time waiting it. I'm out! I'll better wait for Goldmine 7 or go to Terrasoft CRM
1,Too Many Compatibility Issues,"I've been using ACT! for several years and have been happy until I started using it on multiple machines. I am having all kinds of compatibility issues, especially with customization of layouts. Changes made on one machine don't integrate with the others, data fields get rearranged, renamed, or disappear altogether, and often data is completely lost. I can't get synchronization to work at all. I am looking for a new database program with fewer bugs and issues. Any recommendations?-Jason Lipsjasonlips00@yahoo.com"
2,ACT! 6.0 a real failure...,"I've been using ACT! since it was 1stACT! for DOS. I guess you could say I'm addicted. ACT! 6.0 started going bad when I tried to use my DYMO Labelmaker with it. The two companies gave me some patches that were a total waste of time. Then, I returned ACT!6.0 for it's ""Full Money Back Guarantee"" and the company had the audacity to charge me for shipping and not refund the tax I paid. After some arguing they sent a check for the ""full"" amount. Really I had great hopes for the new, old company yet they were just horrible to deal with and ACT! 6.0 is a dog.What I did was find an old versiong of ACT! 2.8 for MacMini (one of its best versions) and am now trying to transfer files from ACT! 5.0 into it. If anybody has suggestions [...]Good luck yet I'd stick to ACT! 5.0 or prior if I were you."
4,Very good CRM software,I like this software because of the features that are very important for my business. I recommend this software if you are not using Outlook or any other contact management software. Unfortunately it is price is a bit high.
1,ACT 5.0,"I can't rate 6.0 but I can tell you that the 5.0 version stinks! I use it at work and it absolutely drives me nuts! I am actually going to switch jobs because I refuse to get stressed out by a database. It moves sooooo slow. Contact card changes but notes and history doesn't. I liked it at first when it was quicker but no one seems to know why this is happening. Notes disappear, it has it's own mind!"
3,insufficient email capability,"There are many useful features in ACT, but the current email client is not one of them.Version 6.0 of the software does not support an ISP with outbound authentication - and I learned this the hard way. When I switched my internet provider from dialup to a new DSL account, I lost the ability to send emails from within the ACT email client.The workaround using Microsoft Outlook is incredibly cumbersome. This email glitch seriously undercuts an otherwise good software."
1,Slow beyond belief,"I have been using ACT for 10 years and each version has been worse than the last. Act 2005 is the worst ever. It is so slow, it is unusable. I would rather keep my contact on post-it notes!DO NOT waste your money."
1,Works but is a pain,"I purchased 6 of these and on every one the screw holding the key becomes loose. Over the 1st year I have spent hours (ten minutes at a time) getting a screwdriver, tightening the screw. Then after a while the screw breaks. I go to the store and have to find another screw which because of the small hole won't fit. Don't waist you time with this lock. This is a perfect example of the saying ""A chain is only as good as its weakest link""."
4,Very convenient and secure,"This key box is fantastic. Changing codes is a snap and the electronic time stamp is reassuring to know its used appropriately by nannies, housesitters and housekeepers. The color blends in well with our back door frame. My only complaint is the screw that holds the key in place easily bends, but that doesn't compromise the lock box security."
1,Worst club mixes ever,"I mainly purchased this CD for the song by Chab ""Closer to Me"" and the DJ only plays it for a little over 3 minutes, what a dissapointment. Well, the rest of the CD is purely unlistenable, the songs have the same boring electro beat going through them and they are mainly instrumentals. The worst is the second CD is just electronic sounds and beats. Believe me, save your money and get something else, I wish I had!!"
2,Bad quality,The material of the shower filter is bad quality. It got cracked once I've screwed it on the pipe. I wasn't able to use it as it was leaking all over the place. The seller was very prompt and I was refunded right away. As I live in Canada they didn't ask me to ship the defective filter back to US.
1,Carbon Particles Broke Through! AVOID THIS PRODUCT!,"This filter is touted as being reversible, so that you can extend its use.I reversed mine after just 3 months, to have it get used gradually on BOTH ends, and not wait till it was actually over filled on just one side.When I reversed it, the next day, the filter broke through releasing all the carbon pellets and particles.It was a mess, and the carbon is small and hard AND SHARP jagged edged. You do not want this on your bathroom shower floor, I can promise you that.It ruined my expensive Speakerman shower head that was attached to the filter!Buy another brand. You'll thank me later."
3,Rubber Bands,What can you say.Their good rubber band for holding a model airplane wing on.I recieved them on time.I'm happy.
1,"worse than bad, this book is a waste of money","While I admit I only got about 15 stories into this book, that was more than enough for me. This is a terrbile book. The stories are poorly written and boring. More important, they are not miracles by any stretch of the imagination. A little girl snooping in her mother's closet finds that she is getting a barbie for Christmas? That's her ""miracle""? Give me a break!! I have had many real miracles occur in my life, and none of the stories in this book qualify as such. only a small proportion can even be called ""heartwarming."" And what is this ridiculous business of ""I prayed to my angels and a miracle occured""? Who prays to angels? I pray to God! He creates real miracles."
5,Christmas Miracles,This book arrived in a timely manner and there no issues. Book was in great condition. thank you
5,they have sold out of this book.........sell me a copy!,"i have searched and attempted to buy this book. this co. haven't been able to locate this book. since it is so controverial i would like to purchase a copy ASAP. notify the company of the cost, etc."
5,Celine,Always loved her music - Have every other CD of hers - Nothing I didnt like about it - The CD was in good condition - Could recommend to anyone who asks
5,Great!,"This book was purchased new and was delivered quickly, and without any damage even though it is a fairly heavy book."
5,Great read!,"In the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains lies Hocking County, sometimes exciting, occasionally mysterious, but always colorful and entertaining. Ron Brimner's ""There are Masons in the Hills"" sheds light not only on rural Ohio life in the mid 20th century, but hints at the centuries old secrets of masonic brotherhood. These are stories of ""good vs. evil"" and the struggles his characters embrace are elequently told and thoughtfully developed. Well worth the time and worthy of many second readings."
4,intelligent acid house,"My brother sold mine for a pack of cigarettes a few years back so I figured I'd pick it up again. This is a fine piece of acid house and has stood the test of time from the well known scottish duo Slam. It is mainly chill with some nice peaks. I'm so out of it I don't even know if this genre still exists, so it may be like a mayan artifact in a few years. The world needs more acid and house and this mix brings back fond memories of aliens and flashing lights. The psychotrance series is often confused with the ""anthem"" type of trance collections in that they tend to have a more genuine psychedelic club/rave sound to them, at least as it sounded back then. In other words, this isn't music to do your jazzercise with.If the word psychedelic is merely theoretical to you, I suggest you avoid this for all of our sakes.4/5 spliffs"
4,Still in my collection...,"I've had this cd for over 6 years, it still lives in my collection due to its caliber of tracks and how they're presented by Slam. The title ""Psychotrance"" doesn't suit this particular release (which is more deep to tech-house), as main-stream Trance recently is experiencing the backlash from the business, whereas this can still be jammed to. I wouldn't recommend this as a peak hour listen, but getting the party started (open bar hour) it's not too shabby."
3,Partially Broken Already,"As the other reviews have stated, this game is enjoyable. I mean a bunny hopping right off the game board. What child isn't going to love that? It has a good educational component as the children try and remember which bunnies do not hop. Since it is the bunnies themselves that hop or not this changes every game which keeps it challenging even once they figure out this trick. The problem - this game was played three days, with an adult every playing along at all times, and already one of the farmers doesn't work. The farmer was not pounded on. The game was not dropped. What a disappointment to have yet another toy just not built well. Luckily you can press any farmer so the game is still usable, but this was an expensive game that should have lasted longer than that!"
1,Piece of JUNK,The toy is cheap plastic and has no educational value whatsoever! I have purchased much nicer games that were much cheaper! DO NOT BUY! Can't believe there are any good reviews.
2,Complicated Instructions,"Not as much fun as we expected, given the other reviews were so good. It says you don't have to read, but not entirely true, unless the kids have a great memory to remember what each picture on the die means."
5,Our 3yo loves it!,"We bought this game based on the good reviews here. It does not disappoint. Our 3yo loves it. She has learned who is missing what colors, who needs what color, and is starting to learn which bunnies have already been tried, so I think it is educational. And it's fun. We like it and her older cousins like to play it with her.I would have given durability 5 stars, but one of the holes has become ""sticky"" and the bunnies that are supposed to hop don't when they're placed in it."
2,Nothing To Hop Home About,A Christmas gift. The only educational part of the game is matching the colors on the die with the colors on the bunny. Lost interest right away. We will try it again next week.
1,Might have been a fun game if it worked,"The game never worked. Some of the holes for the bunnies were very tight so the bunnies wouldn't ""hop"". They also caused the springs in the bunnies to bend so any bunny placed in those holes wouldn't ""hop"" in the other holes until the spring was fixed. We tried to play anyway, but it wasn't very fun without the hopping. Very disappointing."
1,Where are the bunnies?,"This is the first time That I have ever written a review, but, I am still so mad about this. I was so excited to play this game with my three year old son, but when we opened it on Christmas morning, we were both suprised to find that there were no bunny or farmer game pieces! You can't play the game without the bunny's and farmer's!! I would have loved to give this game more stars, but, we never got to play it."
5,"DenTek Floss Brush Interdental Picks, With Fluoride, 30 Each","I agree with the preceeding writer. I used to find this product through the Gaiam website but alas, it disappeared. I have had a bug of a time finding them, but I too found them thru Amazon. I too bought a whole bunch. I usually have the bad fortune of falling in love with a product only to have it disappear from the marketplace."
2,disappointing,"After all the best-book-of-the-year lists this one was on, I was expecting something really special, perhaps a cross between A Year in Provance and Julia Child. Instead, we are given a few not unpleasant ruminations about gardens and some recipes. The recipies could only have been written by a woman too young to care about calories. So much butter, so much cream, so little imagination. All of those fresh vegetables and herbs, surely she might have come up with something more original, or at least the occasional vegetable dish without butterfat. If the recipeis were nothing special, neither was the writing and neither was the story line."
3,Morally Flawed,Read John Thorne's review inMouth Wide Open: A Cook and His Appetiteabout the moral flaw that lies at the heart of Ms. Hesser's book.
4,Wonderful; captures the rustic French garden and cooking style,This book is for anyone who enjoys the backstory of recipes or food in general. It is an easy read and the recipes I have tried are wonderful!
3,moderately dull,"I love narrative cookbooks, and I looked forward to reading this one. However, it is rather dull, and the writing is sometimes strained. There is a lot of description, but not always very interesting. ."
5,A great deck and a great value,"Considering how expensive professional equipment can be over the same thing for consumers, this deck is VERY well priced. I have had mine for over a year. It is quiet. Reliable. Very fast rewind and fastforward.I sometimes get DVCAM tape in PAL format and it is an easy flick of the switch to capture PAL onto my computer from it. Then switch back to ntsc for the next. The ability to use MiniDV and full size DVCAM tape in the same deck is a big plus too.With the foot for using it on it's side, it takes up very little desk space too. I highly recommend this deck to pro-am and professional video editors."
1,Burnt out the motor the first day,"Like all of the other reviews here, I bought this at home depot and proceeded to break it on the first day. I'm typically hard on my tools (i.e. - I use them regularly), but blowing the motor in a hedge clipper when it jams on a large branch is *NOT* what I expect.Despite all the warnings to stay away from this... if you *DO* buy one, make sure that you use a good dual action hedge clipper on everything you can reach before you use this for parts you can't reach, and you might manage to have this not break for a while."
2,Poorly constructed,"The idea for this product is very good, but the construction was very poor. The telescoping handle would not lock in place. This makes the product very difficult to work with."
1,Oh Please....no more junk!,"I am on my third Remington Hedge Wizard. All of them have either fell apart after one use or the internal cam mechanism skips when anything bigger than a pencil is cut. The idea is a good one but the design is horrendous. Whoever designed this thing should be fired today! I called the manufacturer and they were very sympathetic and promised me a ""good one"". The guy on the phone was extremely nice and helpfull even though I was upset. Good service from that standpoint but I do not think that good service can fix the design screw ups. The plastic housing is weak, the pivot stop is weak, the handle is not ergonomically friendly. It is also clunky. One of my units got hot and started smoking after a few minutes. I opened up the blade cover and saw that the plastic had melted."
1,Broke on first use,"I should have listened to the other reviews. This is a good idea but it's not tough enough for a large shrub. This trimmer is intended to be used on large shrubs but the first time it caught on a large branch the blade jumped off the cam. I opened the case and took off the cam cover as the manual describes for changing the blades. Unfortunately the self-securing bolts don't self secure and I could not get the nuts back on tightly. After that, the unit wouldn't cut well at all. It seems that these parts are designed to be replaced once they are removed. It's not a good design if you have to replace the blades every time it catches on a large branch."
1,do not buy this,"I used it in the fall of last year and noticed something wrong just as I finished the trimming project. I stored it determined to figure out the problem next time I used it. Well the inside of the case was shattered (plastic everywhere) which supports the swivel, so it was not usable. I called the company and the company said take it back to Home Depot. Great customer service following the near twenty minute wait on hold. Get another brand besides this one or risk facing similar problems. The internals of this thing was plastic where better design IS necessary."
1,Junk,Very poor quality.I used this trimmer only twice. The swivel hinge became loose and was not holding the angle position and the motor blew after getting jammed on a not-very-thick branch.I returned it immediately.
1,Plastic Piece of Garbage,"The concept is great; it does allow you to reach difficult spots. However, the housing is constructed of cheap plastic. After two uses, the lock on the swivel head broke. I'm having a rough time finding replacement parts. Save your money. This piece of equipment, and the service provided by the manufacturer, are abysmal."
1,Cheap plastic junk,"My girlfriend got one of these for Christmas. After using it for about an hour, the swivel function would not lock in place, rendering it useless. There were obviously parts rattling around inside the unit. I opened the housing to see if I could fix it, and a bunch of plastic parts fell out. The thing is held together with metal screws that go into plastic pieces with metal threaded inserts. Half of the screws holding the thing together had snapped their cheap plastic posts.I've never seen such a badly engineered ""power tool"" in my life.Thankfully Home Depot took the unit back with NO hassles.Thanks to this one product, I'll never buy a ""power tool"" with the Remington name on it again.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
2,Experienced hedge trimmer,"Trimmer works fine on smal branchs but on a branch that is larger but will fit into 3/4"" jaw it will bind and the cam on drive willdisengage from and freeze up cutter. Unit has to disassembled to align cam. Very time consuming. Seems like this unit is now a lost child becauseno one wants to claim it at Tech Support. I couldn,t even find out from Tech Support how to order a new cam. Seems Remington has folded and thisunit is now manufactored by China or Mexico and there is no way to find a repair shop that is sanctioned by Tech Support.I feel like I wasted $100 bucks on this item.4"
1,"Bad design-bought 2, both broken","I bought the extended hedge trimmer last year and soon after broke. I bought a second one and it broke today. Unfortunately there is nothing out there at the Home Depots, lowes or Sears long enough for trimming my hedges. I bought a line trimmer adapter, but it is too heavy and the motor seems to be in the way..Too bad, this product could be an excellent tool, but unfotunately the design and manufacture is Junk..Do not buy it..you will regret it. Unless you do not mind paying $99 for a disposable Hedge trimmer."
1,Extremely Poor Quality,"I bought this unit in the summer of 2005 for occasional use to reach the tops of the taller shrubs in my yard. It cut poorly from the start (just as other reviewers have stated), but I thought that it would suffice for very limited use. How wrong I was. I mananged to baby it through one season; however, it literally blew into pieces when using it this spring! I had noticed a number of cracks that had appeared in the housing, but hoped that they weren't a major problem. Wrong again. I keep my tools clean, lubricated, and sharpened and many of them are 20 years or older. In 40 years of buying tools, this is the worst piece of junk I've ever owned. Please do not waste your money like I did."
3,"""T"" Handle broke after 1 use","I purchased this from Home Depot and used it once. I tried to adjust the tilt head and the ""T"" handle broke in 3 pieces. Returned it for a refund."
1,"Remington Access AT3017 died, 2nd one, light use","My Remington Hedge Wizard 110946 stopped working after 18 months; used 3 times on two bushes with thin branches. The warranty replacement, model AT3017B, lasted 5 years; used 5 times total on same two bushes. The motor fails to run on both units. I was satisfied with the performance while they worked. Buy something else."
1,1 star is too many for this product,It lost power after a few months. The motor got burned after a year.Don't buy it!!!!
2,Hedge Trimmer not up to the job,"I had several negative issues with this hedge trimmer(I returned it) The motor at the end of the shaft made it heavy, unwieldy and tiring to work with. The stated capability to cut 3/4 inch branches was a serious overstatement and it cut only when you could approach the material from a 90' angle. Any other approach would shred the twigs and bind up the blades.A redesign and better materials would be necessary before I would try this tool again."
1,Broke on second use,"As with most of the units reviewed, the cam failed on the second use. The unit was purchased at Home Depot."
1,Remington Access Electric Pole Trimmer Model AT3017B,"I bought this trimmer at Home Depot in 2007, used it 3 times and it did a good job. However when I plugged it in today the motor started smoking and the trimmer is dead! I called the 800# in the manual and was informed that Remington was no longer associated with them and they gave me another number to call. So I called that number and got a recording that the number was disconnected! I'm pretty much screwed. STAY AWAY FROM REMINGTON PRODUCTS!"
4,Remington Hedge Wizard,The hedge trimmer did just the job I was looking for. The price was right and the product was delivered in perfect condition.
1,Horrible quality,"I have bought two of these and both have broken within one or two seasons. Last purchase was May 2011. This second one broke and was replaced under warranty less than 10 months ago. Guess what? The replacement just broke as well!The unit works very well but, if you try to cut anything other than small diameter branches - say a little smaller than a pencil - the unit seizes up and that's that. All the gears inside are plastic, so that may explain it.Nice idea, horribly poor execution.Truly a seasonal disposable product."
1,Has Design Flaw,"Initially I liked the overall design with the extended handle and swivel head etc.., however , after a few minutes of use the hedger would jam when cutting anything larger than a small pencil. I freed it up several times and then when using again had the same results. The cam would jam with the hedger blade assembly. To me it seems to be a poor design in that the cam needed to be larger in diameter to keep from coming misaligned and jamming with the blade assembly when coming in contact with larger hedge stems. A normal hedger would jam when something is caught in the blades , however, the cam assembly on this hedger would just jam without anything caught or stuck in the cutting blades. I would recommend that Remington look at figuring out this problem as this seems to be the only flaw in the design. Anyway, returning the hedger for a refund. (Nell is my wife and she bought this for me for Fathers Day 2012 --- This is my review from Arthur Davis - Folsom Louisiana)"
1,remmington garbage --,Remmington should be ashamed of themselves and i hope this garbarge that they unleashed on the consumers hits them were they deserve it in the pocket..bought this unit a year ago..did not cut the thickness of limbs as advertised without binding..eventually the motor gave out..i was very careful on size of limb that i cut..save your money.
2,NEW IMPROVED MODEL COMING,"I purchased the Remington Model AT3017B pole trimmer over 1 year ago and didn't have any problems until recently, when I experienced the ""cam disengaging from the cutter blade assembly"" problem.I called a NEW DESA Customer Service number (1-800-626-2237) and mentioned my problem. Expecting some long line of ""Red Tape"" to get the trimmer repaired, I was told I would get a new, vastly improved model in a few days. The Rep didn't even want my sales receipt,or return of my trimmer! For those with all the problems cited in the reviews - call and get your replacement."
2,Difficult cutting even small brances,Difficult cutting even small brances any brances over 1/4 inch the trimmer would not cut. The trimmer is heavy when working overhead.
3,A survey of test methods,"I bought this book seeking practical information relating to testing of manufactured PCB assemblies. I found relatively little information on that subject, and the information I did find was of a general nature.I got the impression that if you are interested in a survey of issues dealing with mechnaical failures, you might find more to like in this book."
5,Outstanding,"Great, only get this book if you want to make significant improvements to the quality of your products...My only negative is how he treats Reliability/Testing and DOE as 2 seperate topics rather than in combination. But other than this, outstanding."
1,This WILL break. Don't chance it. Awful.,This is a piece of junk. Trust me; don't buy it. It WILL break. Don't waste the time it will take to put it together and then put it back in the box to return it.
1,Very Pretty - Just Don't Plan To Use It!,"The choice of wood type is very poor for this design. It is very light and far too weak for actual use. Ours was very nice looking as long as it just sat there as a decoration; however, a handful of coats tipped it over, resulting in a broken leg and two broken pegs. It was obvious that attempting to glue it would be a waste of time. If you don't have children or pets that might accidentally tip it over, and only intend to use it as a decorative piece, it might be the right choice for you. Otherwise, stay clear and spend your money elsewhere!"
5,Very nice for the price,"It is a great product for the price.. Very satisfied and still using it since the last winter. Hoping to use it for at least 5-10 years. If something breaks, I think it's easy to repair/fix."
2,Bad quality,Bad quality. Cracked at the bottom in a week. Upper side broke after one month. Will not recommend. Very cheap quality.
4,Quick and simple!,"This product looks great. It made for light loads, but will sever find in my house. It was a breeze to put together! All screws together and BAM! Can I have your coat please?"
4,Love it!,"Everything I wanted...easy to assemble, in great condition and sturdy!! Well pleased! And as a bonus, it actually matches a hall table that I bought several years ago that I forgot I had! :)"
3,Would have rated it 5 stars but.....,"Great looking tree and sturdy for the price. There was a part missing in the tree so I could not screw in one of the pieces. If it weren't for that, I would be very pleased."
3,Twist Style Cherry Finish Wood Coat Rack Stand,"It works fine; we hang four-five light-weights jackets. No tipping and all hooks are still attached. Hey, you got what you paid for ($13.00). However, $12.00 for shipping is too much!"
4,Great coat rack,"I was looking for a coat rack that looks good but also is sturdy enough to hold on to a couple of coats. The design and price was perfect for this rack but I was just a little worried about the quality but so far using it for a month, I can say the quality is very good. Fit finish is also good. Assembly was easy. Overall very satisfied with the product."
2,You get what you pay for,"Looks nice and easy to put together but if you put the coats on unevenly it tips over and the 2nd time it tipped, one of the legs snapped off."
3,beautiful and stable but need more careful.,"The item was good, stable in the bedroom with beautiful polishing surface and easy to be asembled.However I did not find the topest part of it which I guess may be missed by someone who shipped it."
4,Coat Rack Critique,"Nice to have I bought because I have another one and needed one for different floor of house. Easy to put together, looks nice, even with shipping it was below anything I could buy around here!I recommend this product."
2,Lasted almost a year....,Then the wood split right up the base. Coats were evenly distributed on the rack. A little disappointing but you get what you pay for.
3,Nice Rack!,"Easy assmbly and looks great. I love the style of the wood, and it fits so easlier wherever I want it too. It can be a little unstable when my roommate piles on WAY to many coats on one side, and doesn't even them out throughout the rack, but for the most part, it's great. Good looking style, Good price, and I just love it.Great Product.-- It's been about 3 years since this review. I still have this coat rack, it has broken in a number of ways but was able to be repaired and still used. The problem is the feet. They appear to be made of a compressed mulch of wood that was then finished. The result is something that looks nice but doesn't hold up to much abuse. The feet themselves haven't broken in half or anything, it's the small lip of wood used to hold the feet to the pole. Those lips break off and leave the foot loose. --"
2,You get what you pay for!,"I bought this for my office, in preparation for winter (I hate hanging wet coats in the back of my chair!). I finally started using it, by hanging light to medium weight coats. I have probably used it 3 or 4 times, and the tree is broken. The wood cracked by the lower end of the ""trunk"", and I had to tape it all around in order to make it usable...It didn't even last one season, and that is without hanging heavy coats! I am very disappointed...This product is of very poor quality. On the upside, it looked really nice, before I put duct tape all along the base! Don't waste your money...."
1,Very Cheap Quality,"I purchased the coat rack about 4 months ago. The rack sticks are very small and close together, thus you cannot really keep many coats on the rack. However, EVEN WORSE -- one of the three legs that the rack stands upon broke. The wood of the rack is EXTREMELY CHEAP QUALITY. I would NOT recommend this rack by all means. AVOID THIS PRODUCT--NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE!!"
3,looks nice,"Assembly wasn't that easy, some pieces did not fit exactly, had to sand down some things to make the feet fit. Seems a little crooked, and won't really hold more than 3 light items. Definitely not meant to hold on to coats. It falls over (specially when standing on carpet) when you place 2 coats."
1,Poor design. It breaks.,"I bought this item 43 days back and it broke yesterday, with just 2 coats hanging on it. The breaking point being the base where three legs join together. One of the three base pieces/legs fell off. Poor design. I am not sure if I can return it."
1,It broke after a year.,"I like it a lot while it lasted. The top of it spins so you can rotate it to get the coat/jacket you want if it is in the corner. I hung my belts and hats on it too. But I hung a couple wool coats, a leather jacket, and a couple hoodies on it and the darn thing broke at the bottom. The feet part cracked through the wood and no matter what I did to repair it, it just kept breaking, so it ended up in the trash."
2,"Looks Good, but Very Unsteady!","The coat rack looks good, but you have to be very careful once it has a few jackets on it. They need to be distributed evenly around the rack or it's very prone to falling over. Mine fell twice before an ""arm"" broke off. Wider legs would make it more stable, as is it's more decorative than utilitarian."
3,Coaster Coat Rack,"It looks good for the price, but the base broke in a couple of weeks. While this is made decent for the most part, a few durability improvements could make this product an excellent one."
2,Looks are decieving,"This item looked great and was very easy to assemble but the quality of the materials and construction are cheap. 3 of the 6 that I purchased for a restaurant were broken within 2 weeks. On the plus side, they were inexpensive. I suppose the adage ""you get what you paid for"" is true."
2,Fell Apart,"We loved this coat rack when we first got it. It worked wonderfully for about 2 months. Then, one day when I was taking the coats off it, one of the legs cracked, making it irreparable :( It is totally going to be missed! I guess next time I will spend a little extra money for something of higher quality."
2,Be prepared to be disappointed!!!!,"I received this coat stand just the other day for use in my office. I was putting it together (which is extremely easy) and sliding the bases into the slots on the pole. When I set it down to stand by itself I head a crack. The wood at the base of the pole where the bases slide into split. Rather than complain and send this one back and wait for another one, (by then the winter season would be almost over) I taped it up and continue to use it. I am not concerned because I just wanted a place to hang my winter coat and having clear tape on the bottom doesn't phase me, but if you are wanting a nice piece that is inexpensive you may want to look elsewhere. Normally I would be ticked and demanding a refund or replacement but I guess I am softening in my older age. It is a decent looking coat stand but just not very well built. You get what you pay for."
3,It's great.,"The coat rack looks lovely... It holds all my winter coats (3). It is very light weight, which means that it's not so sturdy all the time. It may tilt or tip off 1 leg a little when u add a coat or bag to a rack. Also because it's so light weight u have to even out the amount of weight u put on the racks sometimes. However, it's very beautiful and does the job for me. It goes for a great price and arrives within the same week. It's also extremely easy to assemble. If ur thinking about it then get it."
5,"Solid, stable, simple","Presents better in real life than in the picture - was easy to put together (took about 60 seconds) - is very stable and strong (holds my coat, scarf, handbag as well as briefcase complete with laptop, all without falling over). All in all, great value for money."
3,"not perfect, but very functional for the price","I bought this item for the sun porch, where it holds all my garden clothes; several t-shirts, rain jacket, shorts, long pants. sweat shirts. It currently holds 10 garments It was easy to assemble. My one complaint is that the legs don't slide into the post as far as they allow, and when the bottom cover is screwed on, there is a gap. However, despite this, the coat rack stand is solid and stable.They should mention that the top section rotates! (maybe all coat rack stands do this). At first I thought the screw threads were stripped, because I couldn't screw the top section until it was tight - then I realized it is SUPPOSED to work like this."
3,Not the most stable,"This product was very easy to put together and arrived when promised, but when you have more then 4 coats on it its not the most stable! It looks great as well!"
1,Don't buy it,"Seriously, this item is a waste. I put it together and put it in the trash the same day. Soon as I put up 3 coats on it, the legs on the base broke off. Glue doesn't help. Sure a full roll of duct tape will hold it together but who wants that eyesore? Don't buy this product. Go for a metal coat rack."
3,"Fair quality for the price, but not a perfect product","In general, it is ok; however, we found that the top part of the Rack was not perfectly fitted with the rack body when we assembled it. We bought two, and both of them had the same condition."
2,OK for the price.,"I was happy with the look of this coat rack but I will warn buyers, if you are planning to hang many coats on the rack, don't buy this one. I've had this for about 1 year and 2 of the wooden hooks have fallen off. Once they fall off, they really can't be reattached. For the price, I think the product is OK. I decided to buy a new metal rack to avoid this problem again."
3,Coat tree,"This is a beautiful coat tree; however, it came missing a part to put it together. We had to put a dowel in the last piece to finish it."
3,"Looks great, but required better parts for assembly","The wood came in excellent condition and the design and quality are excellent. However, I had a very challenging time screwing the legs into the base. It requires a long and narrow phillips head screwdriver and after a point, it becomes exceedingly difficult to screw into the wood. Nearly requiring a drill. After doing the best I could with my various screws and drivers, I resorted to just using wood glue to faster the legs. This was considerably more effective, but because of the shape of the rack I could not use a clamp to hold the leg as the glue dried.At any rate, the legs remain only slightly wobbly, and this remains a decent deal if you are willing to put a little work into the assembly."
4,I have brought this item twice already.,It's a good coat rack but can easily break also so don't break any legs of this coat rack lol.
1,POOR DESIGN-NOT WORTH WASTING YOUR TIME,I recieved this product and the workmanship on the product was not satifactory and would not give stability to the stand. I returned the product and would not recommend it .
5,Love it,Just what i was looking for thanks! Just what i was looking for thanks! Just what i was looking for thanks!
2,Broken base in less than a month (light use),"This little coat rack is attractive and inexpensive. It is super easy to put together and I recieved it in two days with Amazon Prime. It is a bit unsteady, but serves it's purpose well enough...you just can't pile too many coats on it or it will likely tip over. Seems like there should be another leg on it that might would prevent this from happening. The pegs that hold the coats are also kind of short. I was happy enough with my purchase until today when a piece of wood on the base broke off leaving one of the legs unable to fit onto it, therefore, rendering it useless after less than a month of very light use. I am going to try to glue the piece back on, but I am skeptical that it will hold up too long if at all. I threw the box away so I doubt I could get a replacement, but if the glue doesn't work, I may try. If it were not for the poor quality of craftmanship, I would have given this product a 5 for what it is."
5,Great rack,"This thing is great. The pieces fit together very well, the finish on the wood is fine, and it DOESN'T WOBBLE.All this and it holds my coats. What else could I ask for in a coat rack?"
2,Falls Apart,"To be honest, at $20, I am buying my second one. The first one fell apart. First one of the coat hooks broke. Then, after a few more months, one of the legs broke. I'm too lazy to find another, and at $20, it'll last me another year and a half."
5,Good value,The product is so easy to assemble. I did it without any tools within 5 minutes. My bedroom has become more organized since then.
3,"Bought twice, broke both times","This is nice looking, very affordable, and super easy to assemble, but the legs snapped on BOTH of the racks I bought. I bought one last year and it lasted about a semester. I bought a new one for this fall semester, hoping the old one was a fluke, and it broke in less than 2 months. Shame. Will not be buying a third"
4,What a Great rack!,"Perfect rack for the money. Some of the staining on the wood is a little uneven, but screws together tightly. I'm using it in my office. Hasn't fallen over yet!2012-05-25: Fast-forward to present. Still standing under the Monday-Friday use of 1-3 coats and a backpack being hung on it... not to mention an occasional garment bag. Just keep weight evenly distributed and you'll be fine!!!"
3,Twist style wooden coat rack,"Good product, very simple to put together. Base doesn't really secure well but if you have wood glue it secures just fine."
2,Ok ... Maybe,This book has a couple of useful pages for a beginner but the main problem with this book is that it uses D tuning (A/D/F#/B) tuning rather than the much more common C tuning (G/C/E/A) - so if you're using C tuning (G/C/E/A) then don't buy this book as it'll be no use at all. Wish I'd known this before buying it.
2,a poor help at any level,"I'm a beginner and I bought this book looking for some sound advice on strumming, picking, some chord progressions, and maybe a few songs. This book was a huge letdown. it doesn't cover picking at all, strumming is covered on one page that is devoid of any useful information, and all the songs are hopelessly outdated. Who knows how 'little brown jug' is supposed to sound? For a while I thought that I just didn't understand the hidden genius of the book, but then I got the Hal Leonard Ukulele Method and realized that this first book was just terrible. The Hal Leonard book has actual practice exercises that get progressively harder and I learned a lot from. This Mel Bay book is just terrible."
5,Jesus Lover,"One of the very best, practical and Christ Centered writings I have ever read. Very helpful for daily living and sharing with others."
5,A Perfect Gift,"Need a little gift for someone who has everything? This book makes the perfect fun party gift for birthdays, thank yous, or even for holidays. It is a hilarious book to keep on your coffee table and watch your guests reactions! It has become my standard gift to others. Love it!"
5,"wonderful, fun and whimsical",Love this book! Fun for all ages. Just has that extra touch of whimsy which sets it apart from other opposite books. Special. Giftable. Adorable. Imaginative.
1,Inappropriate,"I found this book really disturbing. For instance the ""boy"" girl"" page they are peeing from different areas. Ever heard of putting a bow on the head of the girl or something? And the ""smart"" ""stupid"" I dont want my kid referring to anything as stupid. Then the one ""opened"" ""closed"" was disgusting. But the one that disturbed me the most was the elephant ""lit"" ""extinguished"" the elephant had fire on his back and then his back was charred. There are a few more that disturbed me as well but those are the worst. I would not eve CONSIDER buying this book for any kid."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"FOR SMALL CHILDREN!!!! It is NOT appropriate!! It was bought for my four year old and has since gone to the dump... it shows boy/girl with illustrations of a elephant peeing out of his male parts, and a female peeing out of hers... then plugged/ unplugged with a cork in the elephants bottom, and then the plug removed and the color pouring out... and then smart/ stupid??? I was DONE at that point... NOT appropriate.."
4,"casual, yet nice","It;s funny, I have turned these into my everyday earrings. I didn't mean to. They go with everything, and I have twin 15 month old twins that don't try to yank at them.They are sturdy, and plainly nice."
2,Bleh,"Dont know why the other reviewer has listed the wrong songs for this cd, the tracklist provided by amazon matches the cd display cover (you can even see from the sticker on the image).As for the songs, not much here, radio edit of supersonic? Why bother when it is on the supersonic single, same deal with the video.... pointless.The Shanks and Bigfoot Remix of Canned Heat is what youd expect from Shanks and Bigfoot, with a thumping house feel to it. It is not a bad remix but is it worth getting the single for just this song, probably not unless your a completist.Overall not worth the trouble unless buying cheap."
1,Not good,"without box, and the bottle was not full-filled. If the quality is still like this, then won't buy it next time."
5,A great peice of literary interptation,"I love this book! The way Neal ties the Harry Potter books to the Bible is really cool. The book itself is well-writen, and overall it's a great example of literary interptation. I enthusiastically recommend this book to any Harry Potter fan."
1,Somebody stop her!!,"Neal couldn't get anyone to listen to her so she decided to ride the coattails of Rowling. Please, don't ruin someone else's brilliant work with your WWJD interpretation."
3,"Interesting read, not strong for group study","Our Sunday School class tried to use this book as a basis for a weekly class. While the book itself is engaging and interesting, you really have to be a die-hard Harry Potter fan to come back to it week after week. The book does not work well for group study -- it is mainly a series of snippets from the novel combined with a Biblical application of that snippet. Each is short -- 2 to 3 pages -- and we found that the application information was highly repetitive. That said, I enjoyed reading the book myself, and would recommend it especially for anyone who's trying to relate the cultural context of Harry Potter to their religious convictions. The author does an outstanding job of pointing out the good in the books."
3,leader hose had to be replaced,The Faucet Extender is working great now. But initially when we turned it on (and we had all the oulets open) the leader hose split and we had water sprayer everywhere. We went out and bought a better quality leader hose and now it works fine.
2,VERY LITTLE Choline? mcg of Choline when it should be mg !?,The label states 40mcg of Choline. mcg is NOT mg but 1mcg = 0.001 mg. So they are only 0.040 mg in 1 dose (2 bears) of Choline? Should Children not get about 200mg/day of Choline ? mg not mcg! Well if so then this level of Choline is not worth mentioning BUT it is advertised in huge letters on the side! Yes Choline is indeed very good for children especially their brain but at this level they are not getting any so whats the point of such a dose? Is this a labeling mistake can somebody clarify me? If this is not a mistake this is highly deceptive!!
1,Lead Found in this Children's Vitamin,"I'm outraged that this vitamin is STILL ON THE MARKET!! I use to give my 2 year old son this vitamin (the recommended dosage on the container is 2 gummy vites per serving) until I read an article called ""A Does of Reality"" in Oprah's June 2004 magazine concerning the lead level in Li'l Critters Gummy Vites. This vitamin contains 2.5 mcg of lead per two gummy bear serving. The article states that even low levels of this heavy metal can possibly disrupt neurobehavioral and cognitive development in children especially under the age of six! Children's bodies cannot eliminate lead as an adult body can; rather, the lead is stored in the child's bones and soft tissues (including the brain!). Lead poisoning can have a huge impact on a child's growth and development. There is a website called leadpoisoningnews.com to get more info on the damaging affects of lead absorption. The article in ""O"" magazine was based on a test done by a company called consumerlab.com."
1,Huh?,"Beyond the lead issue..this is bizarre. Gummy bear vitamins? Unless the child is old enough to understand the difference, what is to stop them from mowing down regular gummy bears because they are under the impression they are good for them? The same with cough syrup suckers, it is medicine, not candy. I would never give these to my kids"
3,Just an OK collection,"Seeing and hearing Montero perform and improvise live is veeeery impressive, which encouraged me to buy this CD. Listening to these compositions and improv's individually is fine, but in taking them all together the sound becomes monotonous. For anyone interested in her improvisations, I suggest getting a CD that has a more varied collection of compositions/songs from which she works."
5,That's The Way She Is,"This song surprised a lot of people who do not follow Celine's music but to the fans this was just another one of her great dance songs. Other great songs like ""Your Light"" and ""Declaration Of Love"" are just as powerful as this song but the words in ""That's The Way It Is"" is very meaningful and can help a lot of people and that's what I like most about Celine's music. ""When life is empty, there's no tomorrow. And loneliness starts to call. Baby don't worry. Forget your sorrow cause love's gonna conquer it all."" -Celine Dion"
1,"Come on, STARGYMNAST","Ok, just by looking at the cover of this book, you get the idea that it isn't for anyone over the age of 10. Once you flip through the pages, that becomes more and more apparent. So, what is STARGYMNAST thinking? She sounds like a walking advertisement for Lynette Jennings.Actual teenagers will have absolutely no interest in this book unless they're on Trading Spaces and want to horrify their neighbor. Go find something sophisticated."
2,Not really for teens,"If I had purchased this book for a teen, I would have been really disappointed. The projects are too ""young"" for teens! The title really should have read ""for Pre-teens"".My pre-teen was relatively happy with the ideas in the book. She got a few cool ideas from it and still had a great time redecorating her room."
1,Boring!,"What teenager would want a teddy bear room? This book only has 4 basic ideas for a room and they all kind of suck. If you want this book , check and see if its at your library because its a waste of money."
2,Just over my head,"On the basis of the publisher's review and those of other readers, I had hoped that I'd be able to follow the path of conceptual developments. True, as advertised, the mathematical rigor was not excessive. Nonetheless, maybe because the author divided the topic into a series of detailed ""cuts"" at multiple levels, I found myself unable to keep track. If someone replied that the problem was me, not the book, I wouldn't argue."
4,Nice Item,This item was easy to assemble. Arrived in excellent shape. WOuld have given it 5 stars but when the box arrives it says it is a 2 tier unit but it is the same product in the box as listed on the site.
2,Over-rated twaddle,"This is Hesse at his most sentimental and naive. He explores both sides of his personality and both are inadequate. Coming back to the book after a break of thirty years, I wondered how I could I have been sdeuced by so much tosh. ""Ah but I was so much younger then, I'm younger than that now."""
4,everglades paddle,We used this book to plan a trip to the glades. The info inside and maps helped a lot. WE still needed a good chart but the maps made it easier to nav. The info on camp sites and routes were pretty accurate.
5,A Paddler's Guide just in time for next years trip!,"I have done numerous loop trips in Everglades National Park by kayak. However, I have never done the entire Wilderness Waterway Trail end to end. I needed a guide to plan my next trip and after some searching, I came across A Paddler's Guide. Having read and used Molloy's ""The Best in Tent Camping Florida"" with much success, I ordered his new Paddler's Guide. I was really impressed with the amount of information, detailed maps, important campsite descriptions and very good general advice for anyone paddling this area. He gives you many trip options with the best possible route to get there. Even if you only have a couple of days to enjoy this wonderful area, you can easily pick from an overnight to a week long adventure. I highly recommend this book to anyone planning a paddling trip to the Everglades. I certainly will use it to plan my next journey through the wilderness waterway!"
4,gets the job done,Easy to apply to the fireplace and blends in really well with our reddish brick. It has been on the hearth for a month now and my 8 month old has been crawling and rolling over it and it is still holding up. Only gave it 4 stars at this point because I can see how easy it will be to tear away from the hearth once little one starts pulling away at it. It does provide a nice cushion around the edge of the brick and I feel at ease when little one crawls on the fireplace.
4,PERFECT!,"This is EXACTLY what we want. Only problem is that it doesn't stick all that well if you have kids that like to play with it. If you can overcome that, you'll have no problems at all!"
5,Saved us numerous ER visits,Our fireplace hearthis pretty largeThis is life saver.Easy to install. U get more there is enough to go around. Just watch out for lil hands that want to yank it off.
4,Just what we were looking for!,For over a year I have looked for the right thing for our fireplace..I FINALLY found it. Installed easy.. looks nice and less worry about the babies getting hurt when next to it.
3,Its okay....,This stuff was a life saver. My son falls and hits his head on the floor a lot when hes growing but the only downer was that the velcro comes off the foam parts and its very easy for him to rip off. I recommend it
1,I would not purchase this again,I bought this product to cover my fireplace. The sticky pad did not work. It arrived looking worn. I would not recommend.
3,kidkusion hearth kushion review,"I liked the hearth kushion because it prevents your baby/child from getting hurt. However, my 1 year-old grandson wants to pull on it and it comes off too easily. If they would make it to stick better that would be great!"
3,"Sticks well, but not the best coverage","I bought this product after reading all the reviews on similar ones on Amazon, and this one seemed like the best bet. Reviews mentioned that this stuck well so long as you used additional adhesive- I actually have found it sticks just fine without the additional adhesive (and ours is stuck to a very rough brick fireplace hearth). The major downside of this product is the small amount of surface area it covers. I've seen other versions of this kind of product that cover much more. While it does protect baby from the sharp corners, I still don't feel very comfortable when she gets near the fireplace as there is not much additional protection there. I haven't tried any of the other brands, so its difficult to say if this one is much better or worse than the other ones."
2,not great.....,"Although a good idea....it still needs some work. We have a brick hearth and a very curious 10 month old....and this is, well, there. First, the double sided tape needs some work - I dont know if anything sticks to brick, but there has to be something stronger that can be offered. Secondly, my 10mo has decided that she wants to continually pull this off - and she can with ease -- we just keep re-sticking it back on! This doesn't look great...doesn't work great....but for the time being it is there."
4,Serves its purpose!,"This is quickly installed and has stayed in place for five months now with no problems. The only complaint I have is that it is not as soft and cushiony as I would have liked, but it is certainly an improvement from the stone hearth of the fireplace I have. I would recommend you put it on before your little one has a chance to notice that it does not belong, that way they are less likely to begin playing with it. My older two kids 7 and 8 cannot remove it with the enclosed adhesive, so I would say my 1 yr old will not be able to pull it off either."
3,Good padding but how to we secure it to the surface?,This padding would be great if it stayed on. We tried the caulk another reviewer suggested and it did not work. Our kids ended up peeling it off. Luckily it came off in big strips. The problem we've always had with all of these padded edge products is keeping it on the surface it's intended in protect our kids against. We're still looking for a good adhesive that won't ruin our brick when we're ready to remove the padding.
3,Functional but too easy for baby to take off,"We purchased this for our fire place to protect my baby, but she now just loves to take it on and off. I wish there was a better way to put it on tightly rather than just with double sided tape. I have to keep re-taping it..now it's just annoying."
1,Don't bother,"My 9 month old had this thing off within minutes, the adhesive simply didn't stick to the brick. I had a different product with my older child before that worked so much better. I'll be searching for that other one again now, because this product was pretty much useless."
1,good concept -bad results,"Great concept for this product . got it , applied it and whoosh , it fell off."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this to keep our 7 month old from hurting herself on our fireplace. She can pull it off!!! Does not stay stuck, and the baby chews on it if we are not watching her."
4,Making brick corners safe for crawling babes...,"Until I had my daughter I had never thought about the essential terribleness of hearth/fireplace design in regards to child safety. I have absolutely NO idea what they did back in olden times when they had to cook in those things, I can barely comprehend ever using our fireplace again now that the baby is in the house.So basically you have this sharp-cornered layer of bricks at perfect stumbling level in front of either a wall of not that thick glass or heavy metal or actual FIRE (or at least dangerous levels of HEAT). Sounds perfectly safe for babes and toddlers right? So while I did have to do a bit of trimming hear and there to make the corners fit for my hearth in the end the product has done it's job. And like previous reviewers have said, you really do need to follow the directions and clean both the guard and the hearth thoroughly and then wipe them down with rubbing alcohol. It really will stick then."
2,Daughter pulls it off,I bought this as soon as my daughter started walking. With it on the fire place it made her want to play with it so she was always by the fireplace playing. She could easily pull it off even after I put stronger tape on it. After taking it off and throwing it in the trash she is uninterested in the fireplace now.
1,Do Not Buy!!! Waste Of Money!! MY SON WENT TO THE ER!!,I bought this product and the first day my 8 month old was able to get it off the fire place. A couple days later he took it off again with only one hand. He then went to grab it with his other hand and went face first into the brick. He had a cut right above his eye. We took him to he ER and they had to put 3 stitches in. OMG! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I actually do not give it any stars but was required to select at least one.
3,Okay product but the adhesive is terrible,This product is good. My baby no longer scratches her belly on the corner of our hearth. The adhesive is TERRIBLE. I was finding the strips of foam all over my house and it became super annoying. My husband bought some PL 300 foam adhesive and now it is immoveable. I was told that the brick will remain unharmed with the foam adhesive but it's on there pretty good! The product is fine- just gotta find a way to keep it on there!
5,Works Great!,"I was concerned that the product would not stick to my brick fireplace as others have noted, but there has not been an issue. We followed the directions and cleaned the tape locations, and after several months, there hasn't been a problem. I was also concerned that our fireplace blower would cause a problem with the glue or foam, but that hasn't been an issue either. We feel much safer with this around the fireplace and and I would purchase this product again."
1,Terrible Product,Followed directions exactly as stated. Bought this to avoid injury with my grandson when he visits. edges started pulling away from adhesive pads couple days after application. Did not stick at all. This stuff was a complete waste of money.
4,Excellent Value,"I've owned these knives for 2 and half years now. The rubber part that keeps the blades in place on the Steak knives only is starting to rot away on a couple of them, but that's probably from using them ALOT and using the dishwasher. I'm actually back on here because I'm considering purchasing a replacement set. Shoot, at $35, I can buy an entire new set and replace any of the existing knives if they break. The two big slicers cut very well as do the two smaller paring knives. They look like you spent more than $35, and I'm not sure you can beat the value at this price point. I highly recommend them."
1,It's gonna rust...trust me on this!,We purchased the cutlery set and 3 pieces rusted very badly after a few months. Spend your money on a more reputable brand.
2,"""Dimensions"" are ridiculous! Nice brass though.","My bad... I didn't read the REVIEWS before I ordered this... I just read the Amazon description which shows 7.5x7.8x3 inches. Actual size of the item is 2 13/16"" tall, 1 3/16 inch wide and the depth of the plate and button is 3/8 inch (the button portion continues another 1/2 inch behind the plate).The brass plate is attractive especially for the price, but this is actually a very small unit.Amazon needs to update the measurements. Hello? Anyone listening??"
4,"Looks great, nice quality","Can't complain, it looks nice and has a good quality build. Compared to what you'll find in home depot, it's pretty unique at an excellent price."
5,Best on the subject,"For anyone interested in the decorative arts of 18th century France, this book is perfect. It has loads of very good pictures for the casually interested person and very clear and in-depth text for those of a more scholarly bent."
3,An overview not an in-depth view of wealthy french interiors,"This book is somewhat misleading in it's title. In many ways ""nick knaks of the french interior"" might be more accurate. This book has some discussion of French aestetics, and some overall views of interiors, but concentrates on individual items such as furniture, porcelain, clientele and furnishing textiles.The book has some lovely photographs, but if you are looking for a book full of wonderful photographs of 18th century French aristocratic interiors, then this book is probably not for you. Most of the photos are of the smaller items like nick knaks that make the ""feeling"" of French interior design.For an overview of the great interior artists of the bits and pieces that make up french interior design this is good, but it's certinally not a comprehensive guide and in many ways is a dissapointing book."
5,"Great recording, highly recommend.","I've heard Bryan live, and this CD is excellent. It's great Sunday afternoon music, or music to relax to with friends on a Saturday night. I highly recommend, and hope he comes out with a new recording soon."
3,Mis-titled,"The ""Routledge Contemporary Introductions to Philosophy"" series has generally been quite good. I recommend their ""Continental Philosophy"" introduction by Cutrofello which is excellent.However, this particular entry by Christman is not as strong, in my opinion, as some of the others. My real disappointment is that it is generally confined to Political Philosophy. There is very little here about Social Philosophy. I urge the reader to inspect the Table of Contents which is available.If you are primarily interested in an introduction to the liberal paradigm in political philosophy and contemporary (though mostly analytical philosophers) discourse on that paradigm, I can recommend the book, perhaps 4 stars. But be aware that its focus is much more narrow than the title might indicate."
2,Not Classic Don Ho,"This is not a good example of classic Don Ho Hawaiian music. The addition of audiance participation takes away from the songs. Also the addition of accordian and harmonica is not traditional for Hawaiian music. Don Ho had a smooth, deep, romantic voice and it is covered up by the amateur background singers and musicians. The style of the songs is not like the originals. Some of these songs sounds more like country/western, pop, and maybe a little Lawrence Welk added. I was very disappointed. I have several old LP's of Don Ho singing all his classics, including Tiny Bubbles, I'll Remember you, and Beautiful Kauai. Which by the way are the only good songs on this CD. I hate to pull out the old LP's when I want good Hawaiian music, but looks like that is what I'll have to do. I lived in Hawaii, so I know what the real things sounds like, and this IS NOT it. Don't waste your money."
3,Intoxicating,"Twelve tiki-torch classics from the incomparable Mr. Don Ho, The Godfather of the Cocktail Nation. On this collection, Ho wraps his patented slurry baritone around such tropical 100 proof hits as ""Pearly Shells""and ""Night Life"". The amazing Ho works his trademark magic on the suggestive audience-participation classic ""E Lei Ka Lei Lei"" And who could forget ""Tiny Bubbles"" ? Not Me! Mix the mai tais, put on your grass skirt, and ROCK!"
3,Don Ho - Greatest Hits,I have not listened to this CD yet but it arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.
1,Don Ho-No,His music does not represent traditional Hawaiian music and can be categorized as lounge lizard commercial.There are many excellent island singers and musicians check them out.
2,Frighteningly Barbaric Sounds,"While Mr. Ho probably represents the ultimate in authentic Hawaiian traditional singing, I can't say I really go for that kind of rough, old-fashioned folk music, with its macho depictions of intertribal warfare and patriarchal oppressiveness. Call me a wimp, but I much prefer the softer smoother sounds of early 1960s ""lounge"" music, with all those cool daddy-o lyrics and mellow instrumental accompaniment. You just can't beat something like Les Elgart or Dick Hyman for soothing background to your next full-tux cocktail party."
5,Wonderful for the techno neophite.,"I bought this set as my first techno purchase. I had a friend who introduced me to this music, and had grown to love it. When I saw this CD with so many great songs and artists on it, I had to have it. It is well worth it. If you are looking for something to open the door to techno music, this is what you need to buy."
5,Electronica at its finest!,"Every aspect of electronica is covered in this beautiful 2 cd set, and covered well. Each song is a new dream. Both CD's take you deep into the mystic land of music especially hipgnosis on the second cd, flaming june by BT, and of course the Rabbit in the Moon track. I have used these CD's at raves, basketball games, and to relax entering a trance that allows me to sleep in the realm of the unkown. Heh."
2,"Should be retitled ""Digital Empire: Electronica's WORST.""","OK. There are some good songs [Flaming June, Block Rockin' Beats, Smiles, Take California, etc.] - yet most of the songs are repetitive, bland and unbelievably annoying. I got this after browsing through the god review and I was stunned at the low quality of this album. Digital Empire II is one of the best compilations I have ever heard. ""Godspeed"" by BT on it is possibly the greatest techno song thus far. ""One 4 Da Head"" [on this one] suonds nearly IDENTICAL to ""Leave Home"" by the Chem. Bros. [which should have been put on this to redeem it a little]. Seriously, just buy the albums that the good songs are from b/c they are good. You don't have to constantly hit the skip button. You were warned. I'm serious. This isn't very good - at all.[get the 2nd one!]"
4,Solid starter set,"These CDs are a great way to sample electronic dance music. There's a great variety starting with big names like Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, and The Crystal Method. But the disks also offer some lesser names like BT (""Flaming June""). The styles also vary from the big beat of The Chemical Brothers to the dreamy trance of BT to the noise of Doormouse. If you're intrigued by electronic dance music, but don't know where to start, try these disks. But be warned, you might get hooked."
5,"For a DJ like me, I just fits.","If you don't know a lot about this style of music and are just wading around looking for something good to start with, this is about the best cd possible. I'd even say it's better than AMP. I find myself still listening to it after 2 years of owning it - something that never happens for me."
2,the best of electronica? Hardly,"I borrowed this from a friend and all I can say is that this compilation was disappointing. Are there good tracks? Sure, there a few cool ones like BT's Flaming June, Underworld's Born Slippy, as well tracks by Fluke, Prodigy, the Crystal Method and maybe a couple more which I can't remember at the moment. The rest seemed annoying. I couldn't believe no tracks by Juno Reactor were included here. Anyway, the track selection, in my view, was rather poor and they coud've done much better."
2,"Should be retitled ""Digital Empire: Electronica's WORST.""","OK. There are some good songs [Faliming June, Block Rockin' Beats, Smiles, Take California, etc.] - yet most of the songs are repetitive, bland and unbelievably annoying. I got this after browsing through the god review and I was stunned at the low quality of this album. Digital Empire II is one of the best compilations I have ever heard. ""Godspeed"" by BT on it is possibly the greatest techno song thus far. ""One 4 Da Head"" [on this one] suonds nearly IDENTICAL to ""Leave Home"" by the Chem. Bros.

You were warned.Avoid. I'm serious. This isn't very good - at all.[get the 2nd one!]"
2,Blah - Buy something else,"There are a couple of ""classics"" in this 2-disc set but unfortunately, it spends a lot more time on the shelf collecting dust than it does in my cd player. I say, keep looking...save your money. There's better dance/electronica out there."
1,Don't buy this CD,"Even though this CD introduced me to many of my now favorite artists (Fatboy Slim, The Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy). It also ruined the rest of electronic music for me. All I can say is don't buy it. Very bad compilation. Boring. Bad mix. Only 3 good songs."
1,You people are insane,"Wow,I've never seen so many good reviews for such a horrible compilation. My friend made me listen to it, and I made him turn it off! All of these reviewers have obviously never been to a rave or even have a clue as to what good techno music is. To call these the best electronica songs ever is a disgrace to techno and embarasses me as a long-time fan of techno/trance/house. There is nothing ""cool"" about mainstream electronic music--when something hits MTV or gets slapped on myriads of trashy compilations, there is something wrong. This is just the result of some label trying to make money off of impressionable kids. Just because something says Prodigy or (even worse) The Chemical Brothers does NOT mean it is good. The people who embrace garbage like this are poseurs; there just is no other word for it. This is one of those mixes you see in the store and can tell that it is worthless just by looking at the cover. I feel sorry for anyone who has wasted their money on it."
3,"Good choices of cuts, but too mainstream.","This compilation is indeed good, but tracks like Prodigy's No Good, and Underworld's Born Slippy were uncalled for. Smaller bands should have had airtime instead, since the big names have mostly been heard."
4,"Good, but...","For those new to electronica, this is a good album for starters. A friend of mine recommended it to me and thought it was good, but there was a part of the first disc where melody was lacking (namely tracks 5-7). Other than that, it's got some very nice rhythms, melodies, and samples."
5,Very Insightful and Helpful Book on Prayer,"This book really helped change my thinking on prayer and drew me to pray more, which is Bing's intent. I just taught a seminar on prayer and used several quotes from the book. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in deepening their relationship with God. It answers a number of practical and important theological questions about prayer in a readable style. Well done!"
5,BEAUTIFUL AND PERVERSE,"A magical, breathtaking, wonderful book that captures the complexity and perversity of life in the so-called Holy Land. Through a series of powerful poems that always maintain a fascinating, delicate balance between the personal and the political, Yosefa Raz chronicles the bittersweet adventures of a young girl growing up in a world of historical majesty, dark sexuality, broken promises, familiar strangers, contagious violence, painful memories, mutual humiliation, and intoxicating yet terrifying sights, smells, and tastes. Brave poetry written with admirable precision, sensitivity, and honesty. A must."
5,Great Wholesome Comedy,"I love this classic movie, about 2 men being forced to changed their evil ways, by working in a community center with under privilege youths, all the while trying to find the mystery man who is behind this blackmailing scheme. The movie features Bill Cosby, Sidney Poitier, Denise Nicholas, James Earl Jones, Tracy Reed, and many more up and coming actors and actressess."
4,A Piece of the Action........,"Once again, Sidney Potier and Bill Cosby come together but this time with more of a serious tone (as much as can be achieved with Cosby and Potier onscreen together.) James Earl Jones, awesome as usual, and an extraordinary supporting cast make the movie a piece you should not miss."
4,Get ready for a good laugh.,"I was happy to receive my dvd. I had planned to watch the movie, alone with others. The movie brought back good memories and good times of when. I was pleased and had a great weekend. The product was nicely wrapped and packaged."
5,Moments for the heart: The very best of Ray Boltz,"What an awesome CD! The beauty and ministry in his songs are priceless. Definitely a great and beautiful gift for anyone. I have given out 13 of these, and each and every person I have given it to loves it."
2,poor quality,"I found this CD to be of poor quality. The selection of songs was great, but the recording of them was not smooth."
4,music,i was raised on this type of music so bought it for reasons of nostalgia. the quality of the recording is good but not great. i have a lousy CD player so i am not sure if the issue is the old recording or my equipment. likely the latter. have to admit that i picked this CD over the other Jackie Gleason recordings because of the cover which depicts a time gone by.
3,Disappointed.,The quality of the cd is average. Have to really turn up the volume to appreciate the music unlike the lp album of long ago that soothed my ears. I do recommend it if you are wanting to hear some of the best music ever played by the Jackie Gleason Orchestra even if the quality is not what you would remember coming from your turntable.
4,Oh Man...,"This CD is great, deffinatley a must for broken beat people. Do you guys even know what ""techno"" is? I don't think so. This CD is not techno, it's break beat/big beat. Know what kind of music you are listening to and quit generalizing electronic music with ""techno"""
3,Not the sound I expected.,"I enjoyed the 2 instrumentals *Broken Spoke Shuffle and * Glory Be from the extra tracks,they fit well.The live extras were 3 man band CCR and not that great.It is a shame they could not have found a few rare live 4 man band CCR tracks to include.As far as the sound of this remasterd CD It does not compare to the 24K gold Green River remasterd disc."
4,Probably CCR's best,"What more do you want? When you buy a CCR album, you know what you're getting... they never really strayed too far from their ""signature sound."" Solid rhythym, with nice guitar work as usual from J. Fogerty (that distinctive swampy blues guitar - I believe a Rickenbacker)... If I knew the songs on the album off the top of my head, I would rank them, or do something cute like that... but, I don't so I'll just say again that this album is worth the measely $9.00 or whatever Amazon charges for it. Vintage CCR."
5,Of Course It's A 5,"Length:: 2:13 MinsI can't add anything to the 5 star reviews except to demo how good ""Bad Moon Rising"" is for JumpRock. I wish I could give it an 8 to offset the three 4 star reviews, none of which give a reason for the downgrade. It's not that I'm obsessive, it's just that I care about justice so very, very, very much - especially for millionare (I assume) rock and rollers like CCR - and good on 'em."
2,What a whiner!,"I have read some of this author's other works and found them quite enjoyable. I had to force myself to finish this book, and that's a rarity for me. The main character, Annemarie, is so selfish as to be unbearable. At close to 40 years of age, she was way too irresponsible and refused to acknowledge her role in a series of life-altering events. She was conveniently able to blame everyone but herself. I really wish I could recoup the time I wasted on this book."
4,Riding lessons kept me interested.,I liked this book because the person who wrote this know of what they speak. They know horses and medicine. I liked the characters very much!
3,A fun read with a few wrinkles,"Sara Gruen presents a solid debut novel. The first chapter absolutely thrilled me, and I fell in love with the language. Unfortunately, that language and tone is not consistent with the rest of the book.I found Annemarie to be unlikeable, but that did make for some good storytelling and events. The book is a bit predictable in terms of love and Annemarie's final life decision. My biggest concern is that the book is peppered with cliches. Gruen's writing proves she is capable of creating original phrases and language; I wish she hadn't slipped into the easy answer of cliches through the novel.Overall, the novel is well crafted and I'll definitely be tempted to read her next."
5,Great story. Great writing.,"The descriptions of Riding Lessons fail to convey in any meaningful way the impact of this story and its author. It is first and foremost a great story, so well written that you become a witness more than a reader.While horses are a major part of the story, it is wrong to think of Riding Lessons as a book ""about horses"". It is about people and their complex relations to each other and about a bond between them and certain animals. Each person in the book seems real and believeable....you ""know"" them, with their loves, absurd mistakes, sometimes ridiculous behavior, and responses to the often painful surprises of life. The depth of the characters unfolds effortlessly, without pretense or affection.Great story. Great writing. Don't miss Riding Lessons."
2,I bought this book with great hope,"Though the author seems to know horses, the character of Annemarie left much to be desired. She was written as to be so absorbed in self pity, that she couldn't see any of the characters around her.When I read that her father was suffering from the last stages of ALS I would have thought that she would come out of herself to some extent and read on in that hope. But these characters were shuffled aside while she whined and cried over what she couldn't have for most of the book.I read on in hope, but found that whether it was her daughter going through the throes of growing up, her mother trying to give her father dignity in his last days or even the man she professes to fall in love with.... the character is so mired in her self interests as to be almost disgusting.I was sadly disappointed in the story."
4,Ridng Lessons,"Sara Gruen writes good stories. (liked Water for Elephants and The Ape House)This is not a heavy book, but rather a quick read which holds one's attention. Anyone with a background in riding or handlinghorses would enjoy it.Kirsten Dawson"
2,Disappointed!!,"I loved Water for Elephants so I looked forward to reading this book by the same author. But, I'm not sure she is the same person as the level was so much lower that Water. The story was predictable, the main character was selfish and unreal. The husband leaving a sterile marriage for the pregnant girlfriend was boring. There was not even feeling in the slow death of her father from ALS, a life-draining disease. I hope Ms Gruen is not a one-book wonder and that there are better novels coming along in the future. This review is written by Elaine Miller. My husband Israel would never have finished this book."
2,Boring,A story of an immature girl who has an older boyfriend and is partners with him in a high end stable. She starts to think that if she moves to New York she can be become a famous writer. No mention of ever writing before or having ever written anything ... just wants to become a famous writer and if she moves to New York then she believes that will happen. After a couple of days in New York she discovers that she doesn't want to live there and she returns to her home in Ocala happy again. Boring
3,easy read...,"I enjoyed the book, but it wasn't what i would call a ""gripping read."" I enjoyed the Horse Whisperer a whole lot more."
2,It's no Water for Elephants,"Easy to read, but not nearly as well done as Water for Elephants. I wouldn't waste your time with this one, unless you're out of books and it's handy."
1,First time I wanted the main character to die....,"This book was ridiculous. I'm sure people like Anne Marie exist, but I wouldn't give her the time of day. She is a self-centered jerk, a terrible mother and daughter and she deserved all of the chaos in her life. Worse, the writing was trite and the story line wasn't believable in any way (what kind of mother would behave that way?).I've never quit reading in the final chapter, but I did with this book. I wanted Anne Marie to die in a firey crash - and I had a feeling that Gruen didn't end the book that way, so I put it down and wrote my own ending. It's really difficult for me to believe that the Gruen who wrote this book, also wrote Water for Elephants. Either she had a major writing metamorphosis, or something fishy is going on."
3,Sara Gruen,"I loved reading Sara Gruen's books ""Water for Elephants"" and the one about the apes in capitivity. I read ""Water for Elephants"" a couple of times and discussed it with friends and my book club. So when I saw this book written by Ms. Gruen I was excited to read it. She did a good job of writting but I did not like the character Annemarie Zimmer. She seemed to be so immature and selfish."
3,was I supposed to feel sorry for her?,"The ""heroine"" of this story did everything but create sympathy reagrdless of her tragic accident as a teen -- which made it difficult to love this book. Her self-centeredness and self-pitying attitude made me grind my teeth."
3,enjoyable,I chose this book because a friend recommended it to me.As a horse lover I enjoyed it and thought maybe that it was a little too emotional for me at times.I would recommend it though to any lovers of horses.
4,Entertaining read.,It helps if you have some background in horses. Enjoyed the story hard to put it down. A modern day romance.
4,Not as good as Water for Elephants...,"I read Water for Elephants by this author and loved it. In both books, the author totally immerses you in the unique world of the characters, in this case horses and professional riding. The book's setting and ""voice"" are very authentic. That said, the tone and subject matter of this book had less general appeal than Water for Elephants -- this is much more for a female audience. It is reminiscent of The Horse Whisperer by Nicholas Evans. I think the book was a little too chock full of hard moments for Annemarie, the main character. I'm not sure that most humans could possibly deal with all of the things that she had to address at the same time. With everything thrown at her, I felt like the ending was a little abrupt and there wasn't sufficient room to address all of them. If she had focused the plot a little more sharply, I think the book would have flowed better. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book but I didn't love it the way I did Water for Elephants."
5,Tissues and chocolate,"Tissues and chocolate because they're what kept me company while I read RIDING LESSONS by Sara Gruen. I needed the tissues for all the poignant touching scenes that pulled me in, and the chocolate because I had to have something to consume while I chewed my nails over Gruen's characters and all they go through in this amazing debut. That is to say I was engrossed. That is to say I was touched, moved, shaken, over-joyed, angry, on fire, torn to pieces and put back together again. That is to say this is a fine, fine book by an author who's now an automatic buy for me. Please put RIDING LESSONS at the top of your to-be-read pile. You'll love it. I can't wait to read the next book by Ms. Gruen. She's fantastic!"
2,Not my type of characters,"Not sure why the title ""Riding Lessons"" actually. But that's not what bothered me about this book. The story could have been really interesting because there's so much going on in Annemarie's life all at once but I just couldn't put up with her personality and the way she dealt with everything.I'm very organized and she's a total mess so her way of thinking and the actions that followed drove me absolutely bonkers."
2,Riding Lessions,"The book was received very timely and in perfect condition.I believe this is a fairly interesting book with a decent story - but I'm having difficulty assessing it - as it is still not finished. And here is the reason: the reader is making it almost impossible to continue listening. Oh! The Drama! I can't imagine who would have made the decision to have this story drawn out and acted out unrelentingly from start to (I assume), the finish, but it must have been someone without a personal history of listening to books. My plan is to finish it, but can only listen when I'm somewhat distracted from that voice speaking at me. I listen to books constantly and have had experience with good and bad readings, but this one is a challenge. Others may like their books dramatically acted out, and if you do, this one if for you."
3,Frustrating read!,"I read this book during superstorm Sandy while I was stuck in the house. I must admit it was a good book to read under such circumstances because it was an easy read that held my interest. I had to take breaks, however, because Annemarie, the main character, was so incredibly dumb that I just wanted to get my hands on her and shake her. She made one bad choice after another and wondered why her life was falling apart around her. Since the author, Sara Gruen, had also written one of my favorite books, Water for Elephants, I was disappointed in how unrealistic I found this book to be. Having said that, if you are simply looking for a fast read that will hold your interest, this may suit the bill."
4,Riding Lessons,I enjoy any book about horses and a little romance. It's about a woman who is going thru a divorce from a cheating husband and the added problem of a rebellious teen daughter. She drags her daughter back east to live on her parent's riding stable. She encounters a few problems going back to live in her parents house.
1,Painful,"I noticed the used price on this book at Amazon and there were 96 available at less than a dollar. In my estimate this would be overpriced. Try as I might and believe me I tried, I could not finish this book. The title character is painful. You keep waiting for her to improve. She doesn't and neither does the story line. OUCH OUCH ...She is shallow, horrible person, lousy mother, terrible daughter, thoughtless, not compassionate.Perhaps her other book is good? I got my copy of this book at a yard sale for 50 cent. Thank the lord I did not pay more.I don't usually bother to pan a book but this one deserves it!"
1,Made myself finish,"I bought this because I enjoyed Water for Elephants so much. I was very dissapointed! I have problems with selfish, self-centered, whiny, adults in my real life, I don't want to read about them too! The main character is so hard to like! And since the story is written in her voice it is even harder to get through! I am so upset that I spent money on this book! If I had read it first it would have been the last Sara Gruen book I would have read."
2,What a disapointment after reading Water For Elpehants,My expectatins were high for another great book. I read the reviews from other readers and most were good to great. What a disapointment. The book was shallow. The characters were predictable. This book was chosen for our book club with great expectations. We all loved Water for Elephants. Next time I will read all of the reviews before selecting.
3,I Love Horses...I Hate This Protagonist,"I finished Water for Elephants which was very good. I love horses, I thought this book, written by the same author, would be great. However, for most of the book, all I wanted to do was throttle the protagonist. Not being someone who ignores my responsibilities, it's grating to read about someone who can't be bothered with actually doing her job and leaps before she looks. Some things in the book were never explained and somehow got wrapped up without the protagonist learning anything. Having to deal with a teenager (and honestly, who really wants to deal with a teenager in real life, why would I want to read about one?) makes it even worse. Just stop with Water for Elephants. You won't have missed anything."
2,Horse porn?,"I admit I bought this book because I liked Water for Elephants by the same author.Also, in the interests of full disclosure I am a horse nut, so for me there was the added incentive of the horse theme in this book.However, this is basically a standard issue woman's romance story, predictable from the beginning, and certianly nothing I'd ever read in the normal course of events. But I was tricked into perservering by the hope that there would at least be some nice horse riding action. But no.Very little of horse interest, a heroine who is mostly a selfish temper tantrum witing to happen, an amazing lack of self-awareness, and loads of tempestuous emotional blow-outs: this book is like the fever dream of a fourteen year old.Gruen has definitely grown as an author since this was published. May she continue to do so."
3,Unlikeable protagonist,"I read this book several years ago, not realizing until now that it was by the same author of ""Water for Elephants,"" which I thoroughly enjoyed. This book was difficult for me to get through, because although I love horses, I did not like Annemarie at all. She was self-centered and hard-headed throughout, and I suffered through tragedy after tragedy with her family, waiting for her to finally ""see the light."" One novel was enough, I did not bother to read the sequel, ""Flying Changes."""
2,Not nearly as good as her later works.,"If you're planning to read Riding Lessons because you loved 'Water for Elephants', you'll likely be disappointed. Thank goodness the author kept writing after this novel! I've become accustomed to horse novels being wildly inaccurate in their portrayal of the horse world, and this one is no exception. However, what is more frustrating with this novel is that I just couldn't bring myself to care about the main character, Anne Marie. Yes, she suffered a terrible tragedy, but she comes across as a selfish person who drinks excessively and lacks self-awareness to the point of pathology. One feels sorry for her child, certainly, but it's difficult to care about a story when the heroine leaves you cold."
1,One of the worst books EVER,"Hard to believe this was written by the author of the masterful 'Water for Elephants' in fact I don't believe it! How could it be???This was such an awful book I kept thinking there was some type of trick up the author's sleeve. But alas, it really was just a bad book.Read the other 1-star reviews, they are all true, accurate and honest. The book is unbelievably maddening and the main character, Annemarie, sickening.I loved 'Water for Elephants' but will NEVER waste my time reading another Sara Gruen book. I feel as if someone cheated me out of a portion of my life. If it wasn't for the fact that I had a Book on CD version, I could never have gotten through it.Yuck!!!"
3,not bad,"First, the three stars because I grade on a tougher curve than most Amazon reviewers, and there are just so many better horse novels out there. BUT, they are also quite sentimental and cliched, so this book in some ways outclasses them.Perhaps the fact that I have read so many books where the abused horse and rider heal together and then win the blue or the Olympic gold made me less receptive to this book - as others have said, I had trouble figuring out where the story was going, as it did not fit your typical ""National Velvet"" plot. I also wished sometimes the main character would start to get her life in gear sooner, but then maybe that was due to all the terminally plucky and tough horse heroines I have been exposed to since childhood.But the horse is intriguing, and the fact that he and the owner DON'T beat all the snobs at the county show is worth the price of the book alone."
1,Not a very good book,"This book was awful. I love horses, used to show jump and had a lots of ups and downs in my life also. I don't like the way the book was written, it was to predictable and the typographical errors in the book I purchased were just awful. Many times, I had to go back and re-read a page just to figure out who was saying what. If they had a zero rating, I would have given it a zero."
5,FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED A HORSE--AND LOST,"Sara Gruen's book will go straight to the heart. The lady knowshorses, riding (and, God knows, writing)--and love."
1,Stay away!,"I was excited to read this book and ended up being very disappointed. I hesitantly bought her other book, Water for Elephants because Riding Lessons was so bad. I hope it is better than this one."
2,Predictable,"Was disappointed in this read since I really enjoy other novels by this author. I found this book to be predictable, lack any depth and boring. I got 3/4 of the way through before I just skimmed to the ""conclusion"""
3,riding lessons,"This is a good story and got me engaged right away. The characters are well drawn. The book is well written, and I would recommend it ."
3,Whiny,"The main character of this book, Annemarie, is incredibly whiny and annoying. It really was a struggle to continue on with the book because of her, but I was listening to it on a ""play-away"" from my library and really wanted to know how it ended so I'm carrying on. But sheesh, will I be glad to be done with this book."
1,Stupidest book I ever read,"I will give this book one star only because of the effort it takes to write a novel. It was stupid from start to finish, and I did not like one thing about this book. Her characters are one dimensional, immature and vapid. I honestly cannot believe it was published. Save your money."
2,Not as great,"I had read this author's first book, Water For Elephants, and just loved it, but was disappointed in this book that I purchased, Riding Lessons. I would not buy the next one. Sandra Manning"
5,Riding Lessons,"If you love horses, then you will not be able to put this book down. This is one of the best ""horse"" books I've read. Sara Gruen is able to combind life, tragedy and a bit of humor seemlessly. Her description of how it feels when you touch a horse is perfect. Even though this book revolves around show horses it really isn't about the horses at all. It's about a woman who needs to find a way to deal with past and present problems."
1,The most unsympathetic character I've ever read.,"Annemarie has created her own hell on earth and is so self centered that she is unable to function as a human being. Everyone tries to help her, but she accepts no help. I think I could have more empathy for Scrooge! Not well written in that I like to empathize with my characters. 387 pages of self pity."
4,"Top Notch, Contemporary Pop Melanie","Very cool renditions of ""Ruby Tuesday."" Three of them, in fact. The ""pop"" version is best, as the rap in the reggae(? ) version is not really rap at all and rather pointless (""here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go!"") and the rock version is something of an outdated cliche'. Still, they're interesting to listen to and one can only imagine the incredible album possibilities utilizing these up to date production values. An updated version of ""Lay Down"" is interesting as well, and yes, much better than any other recent artist's cover. Melanie's unique voice, of course, still shines. The last cut, ""Shine On,"" is the new one here which is an excellent song still in search of an excellent rendering."
4,A hidden treasure,"If by any chance you have found yourself looking at this CD buy it!! This CD starts off with Wagon Christ doing a down beat and leads into some of the most beautiful sounds I've ever heard from earth leakage trip (track 2) and Bedouin ascent (track 3). Track 4 was badly placed with Syzgy doing loud tribal drums that wake you from the last 3 but its still good. Track five is IRRESISTIBLE FORCE--If you love them as I do stop reading and just buy this CD--Track 6 is Air Liquid. Its all worth songs 1-3, I would pay just for those 3 songs."
1,Disapointed,"I expected more music videos on this dvd. Lady GaGa is almost not present. Disapointment is the keyword, and the same goes for the other dvd - Glamourpuss: The Lady Gaga Story :-((I've just wasted my money on 2 dvd's. Should have read presentation more thoroughly, before bying the dvd's.I thought that I purcased concert/music vids and not so much talking about Lady GaGa as there is."
5,The answer: why no movie?,"The reason, in 2005 is clear.1. Terrorism of any kind is not approved2. Destruction of private property is not condoned3. This would make a great movie4. People might get the wrong idea"
1,Just Bad....,"This movie makes no effing sense. It keeps trying to be good, but then just never comes together. Its not scary or thrilling, its just stupid. Good acting, good camera-ing, and suspenseful at times until you realize...nothing happens."
1,Not worth the time.,Tiresome plot and disappointing ending. Nothing new here you haven't seen before in this genre. Cast seemed competent and would be worthy of a better script.
2,occupant-less,this was a bad movie that I'm sorry to say I sat all the way through. It made no sense and was not at all scary; just horror-ible.
2,Thrill to Rearranged Shoes,"Danny (Van Hansis) has to ID his dead Granny. She had a rent controlled apartment in New York City. Danny illegally takes over tenancy of the apartment, and is told he can't leave until the court order comes through where he can take over the lease. Joe (Thorsten Kaye) is the touchy-feely Russian doorman Danny has to contend with. He likes to refer to himself in the third person. ""Joe got paint for you."" ""Joe go ATM for you."" ""Now you need Joe."" Irritating. Also irritating, Sharleen (Cody Horn), who is filming Danny for her video blog. By the 40-minute mark, I was wondering if anything was going to happen at all. Bodies eventually start turning up, and we all know the fate of pets in a horror movie. But no amount of camera shaking, jump cutting, or tense music can up the anxiety when nothing's really happening. Ultimately, nothing in the way of an explanation is given for the semi-strange goings on. A colossal waste of time."
1,OCCUPANT,I did not like this paticular movie. It did not have much of a plot and was not quite understood who the hec was in the apartment other than the grandson of the lady who died. I mean was it the grandmother haunting the place because she diden't want the granson living there or was something there when she lived there and scared her and that's how she died? anyway the grandson was paronoid and crazy as hell.
2,as the world turns,"For reasons that are unknown to me, this movie is coming up as horror. As someone that has seen more than 500 movies in all genres of horror I can empathetically say that ""Occupant"" is in a league of its own. Instead it's about a guy that will cut himself off from the outside world to get his granny's old apartment (what some people won't do to get a rent controlled apartment in New York is beyond me). Filmed on a shoestring budget the movie has a very underground quality to it that is dark and somewhat surreal, although this adds little to the overall insipid plot. The fact that it's only available through VOD and not on blu-ray should have been a tip-off that it's a poorly produced movie. Van Hansis wasn't bad but he didn't project the type of emotion that one goes through as they suffer through utter dementia. Watching him was like watching a racecar get from zero to one-hundred without getting to fifty or seventy-five."
2,Terrible,I can't believe there were viewers that rated this film highly. I thought it looked like somebody's senior project. If you want a decent movie about tennant paranoia rent Polanski's The Tenant.
2,WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR A REALLY NICE APARTMENT?,"The movie reminded me a little of ""Paranormal Activity"" in that it has some hand held camera shots as well as using things like ""DAY NINE."" It reminded me of the classic ""House"" as there was a huge hole in the closet that apparently ""things"" were coming through.Danny Hill's grandmother dies in the opening scene. Danny (Van Hansis) becomes a squatter in her apartment on the advice of Joe, the Doorman (Thorsten Kaye) and Joe's lawyer friend. He wants the apartment for the same rent control price his grandmother had it. The landlord wants Danny out so he can rent the 3500 square foot, downtown NYC apartment for big bucks. Joe gets Danny everything he needs to stay there, unfortunately there are weird things going on in the apartment and Danny quickly develops cabin fever.The movie doesn't have a lot of characters and is practically a one man play. The movie plays you along to the end.F-bomb, brief night time sex, no nudity. 2 1/2 stars at best."
2,What was this all about?,"What is it with so many incoherent screenplays these days? This guy tries to survive slowly going insane in a creepy apartment because if he lasts long enough, he can have it to live in. Okay...and it ends ironically and rather predictably. What is the point?"
2,Misleading Description,It would have been helpful to know this set was for a cake as opposed to decorations for my 'yard' as I desired.
1,Biggest Rip-Off Ever,"This product is described as ""Yard Decorations"" but they are only one inch tall. They are overpriced cake decorations. You will never even see them if you put them in your yard."
5,Nice Intro to Gabber,"This is a nice disc. Fast and hard. Get ""Nightmares from Rotterdam"" in addition to this, if you like it.""Mind Ripper"", ""Natas Is Counting"", and ""Strength Of Unity"" are probably my favorite tracks off this. ""Slaves to the Rave"" is a good one too, but I prefer the previously mentioned remix on ""Nightmares from Rotterdam"".A note to those who read the previous reviewer:Gabber sounding like rock?Not quite. Last time I checked, rock had nothing to do with pounding beats and heavy bass. Gabber is about the hardest and fastest techno you're going to find anywhere. Pounding bass, relentlessly fast beats. If that's not what you're looking for, stick with happycore or trance or something."
5,Great CD,My friend first introduced me to this album about six months ago and I was amazed at how different gabber was from the other types of electronic music I heard. I was immidiatley hooked and bought this CD. I can honestly almost every song on it is great. After buying Hardcorps I went on to buy other compilations by Omar Santana and other North American gabber artists so I would say this a great intro to the whole genre.
4,Product works as expected,I have had this unit now for several years and the only maintenance I have to do yearly is replace the belt which takes about 10 minutes. It's a single stage so for given that handicap it removes the snow and does its job well. Single stages are more prone to clogging especially with wet snow. My only real gripe with the unit is the exhaust which you can't help breathing in and your clothes reek of it when you go back inside. It's a gas/oil mixture and they never burn cleanly.
3,OK Christmas cassette,"A Rock'N'Roll Christmas, Volume 2 was released on October 6, 1998. I'll be honest about this cassette; some songs on it I liked and others I just thought were lame. The Beach Boys-Little Saint Nick and Stevie Wonder-Someday At Christmas were nice to listen to. However, I don't care how drunk or sober I am, Bob & Doug McKenzie's version of the Twelve Days of Christmas is just awful. The other remaining songs were so-so. I like volume one a whole lot better.Side OneBryan Adams-Christmas TimeDave Edmunds-Run Rudolph RunBeach Boys-Little Saint Nick#3 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Singles#14 U.S. Billboard Hot Holiday Songs#69 U.S. Cash Box Magazine Top SinglesSqueeze-Christmas DayAngel-Christmas DaySide TwoStevie Wonder-Someday At Christmas#24 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesPaul and Paula-Holiday TeensChris Deburgh-A Spaceman Came TravelingBob & Doug McKenzie-Twelve Days of ChristmasLocal H-Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"
2,OK but not the greatest,"Purchased to get the Run Run Rudolph song, the rest aren't really that good."
2,for one cut only,"I got this for the Angel track, something I had heard on the radio only once, but fortunately the tape machine was running, and the imperfect copy became one of my favorite Christmas songs. The rest of the tracks are ones I've had for years, or don't want at all, (Brian Addams?), but appreciated finding this in the cut out bin."

Because the enjoyment of discovering our favorite goodies and trinkets is instant joy, no wrapping paper to take off, no waiting for your turn, and no dissapointment because it is filled by those who know you best.

4,Pretty Good,"It's big enough for two adults to sit or one adult to lay down. I got two of them to put together. I like that it folds up and is pretty compact. But the material feels like it could be flimsy. There hasn't been any wear and tear on mine yet, and I bought these a year ago, but I haven't used them that much. I've used them maybe 4 times. But it is great to place on damp grass so that you stay dry. And perfect for the beach. It's easy and small enough to just leave in the car to use anytime!"
2,so so mat,the mat was not as big as i expected. only big enough for one person. i like the fact the it can fold up. but the quality was not great. will not buy again.
3,Very Entertaining and Some Lessons To Be Heard!,I got this book on a whim because I had heard about the author and the booked looked more like a good read than an instructional book. You kinda get both for the price of the one. It reads kinda like a book full of short stories and every one has a life lesson that any martial artist or even anyone for that matter can use. I will definantly check out books from this same artist. I gave this book 3 stars and not the most because it could have been longer. I was kinda sad to finish it.
2,anecdotal,"I've been impressed with quite a few titles by Loren Christensen: the fighters fact book, solo training, fighting power. But this is old Loren sitting by the fire boring everybody with his stories about the olden days."
3,Treadles Butterfly,This is a really cute toy! Very well made as is the case with all Manhattan Toys I have purchased. Just as I expected.
3,You get what you pay for,"We got this for our newborn, and within the first two weeks of use, the liner (that I assume is supposed to keep odor in) fell out because it got caught on one of the stickies on the diaper. This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie."
4,good buy,"We have been using a d. champ for nearly four years now - it has been very convenient, easy to use, and as close to odorless as one could reasonably hope. We bought it for our son, and when his little sister was born, we bought a different one because the store we were in didn't have a champ. When my son learned to use the toilet, we got rid of the new one and moved the champ into my daughter's room."
5,THE BEST DIAPER PAIL ON THE MARKET!!!,"As a first time mother, I wanted to get the best for my daughter. I shopped around a lot, and asked a lot of questions. While at someone's house, I saw the Diaper Champ. It was one that I hadn't seen very much in the various stores I shopped in. I was immediately impressed by the ease of it, and the convenience of being able to use ANY bag!!!When I bought it, I didn't have a chance to show my husband how to use it -- but no worries!!! It is so simple to figure out how to use! My nephew -- a toddler, knows how to use it (without him being able to open it up!)I've even recommended it to strangers in the baby stores!You'll love it!"
4,A good choice,"This is simple to use, easy to clean, and holds quite a bit of diapers. It is definitely a plus that it uses regular garbage bags and makes it the best choice, in my opinion. When the pail starts getting full, you may detect slight odors - nothing too bad. Simply changing the bag and spraying with Lysol does the trick. I think the use of regular garbage bags outweighs the slight odor."
4,Very Pleased With This Product,"I registered for this product, because I did not want to spend money on buying refills for it. I have only been using it the past two months since my daughter is only 9 weeks old, but so far so good. The only drawback would be that sometimes the diapers get stuck when you try to turn it, because of the tape and also the wipes if you throw those away by themselves."
4,Good Diaper Pail,"Diaper Champ works well for me. It holds lots of diapers and I do not have to spend money on refill bags. I use tall kitchen trash bags. I am starting to notice an oder escape from the diaper pail but it's nothing that I cannot handle. I just use that as a sign to empty it, spray with Lysol and replace the bag."
2,"Good for an infant, Nasty for a toddler","While my son was an infant, the Champ was fine. Real food produces real smells and breast milk and formula did not. Now that he's a toddler, I have stopped using it because.... I am LAZY! I have NO TIME or PLACE to clean up the thing to make it stop smelling. This is one of the suggestions/rules of ANY diaper refuse product. To make it work well, buy THICK trash bags not generic brands. The thicker the bag, the less smell seeps out. I just put the Champ in the trash can.To me however, the Genie seems to offend less. For the past year I have had a used Diaper Genie and for my son's most offensive diapers, they go in there! It just finally broke and I'm online today to buy another Genie. Hope this recent mention helps."
4,A great Diaper Pail,"I love this diaper pail. I have used the Diaper Genie and even though that is a good product, I much prefer this. No refils to buy, and it is totally nose freindly (no smells). It only smells when you open it to change the bag.I only gave it 4 stars though as another consumer mentioned it is very hard to open, broke many a nail trying to open.Otherwise a wonderful product, it can hold way more diapers than the genie can, so you don't need to change it as often."
1,"Bad odor, poor function","I purchased this diaper pail before my child was born thinking all diaper pails were the same. I was wrong! This diaper pail has smelled bad from the beginning. It must be changed daily (or more) to keep out bad odors, and be washed. Also, it hurts your hand to open it and empty it. What a pain. I'm glad I received diaper genie as a shower gift. Much better at keeping out odors. Really a trash can would work just as well as this diaper pail."
1,It Never Worked Properly,"We bought this, tried it and never got it to work properly. The air-lock gasket kept getting caught when you would try to drop the diaper into the hopper. Being an engineer, I quickly concluded it was pointless to expend any energy on getting it to work, and just threw it out. We bought a small SimpleHuman step can, and have been very happy, since. If you get a SimpleHuman can, I recommend getting the bags designed to be used with the can."
1,Terrible,This thing is terrible. Constant problems with turning the handle to deposit the diapers. Handle always gets stuck.
1,Have to unjam it with every single use,"We had the older diaper champ for years and loved it. The handle broke off so we bought a new one. Perhaps our problem is that we are using it will pull-ups and not diapers but everytime we turn it over, it gets stuck and I have to open it up and push the diaper down. The thing is useless. It frustrates everyone. I'm going to try to find an older model on Ebay. I don't normally review products but I felt so strongly about this one that I had to. I would never recommend this product to anyone."
2,It's Okay,"I purchased the white with blue trim from BabiesRUs and thought it looked and sounded great for the money. I would have rather spent more money for a better one. This ""champ"" will only flip diapers, no trash, q-tips or wipes. If you have anything you want to throw away either open up the entire pail and smell the dirty diapers or have another can just for trash. There is one good mention and that it that it takes normal kitchen size bags. I will be buying a different pail in the next few days."
1,Not recommended,"This product worked well until my child reached about 12 months. I assume it was the larger size of the diapers. At that point, the bin would be half full, but the diapers and wipes would keep popping out of the bin - which is just disgusting. I had to carefully wrap all of the wipes into the dirty diaper and fold each shut. Then waste (the bm variety) smeared all inside of the canister mechanism. I made a valiant attempt to clean it - which is utterly impossible with all of the crevices. I went and bought another ""improved"" Champ. I meticulously folded, rolled and fastened each diaper. But it happened again shortly thereafter. I bought the least expensive ""simple"" diaper pail for $10 and I have not had a problem since."
2,Clunky and stinky,"Here's my list of things I didn't like about this pail:1. I found that the chamber didn't always push the diaper into the pail (had to push by hand...yuk)2. It made a lot of noise when it actually worked3. After a few months of use, the ""stink"" liner tore and fell out which then allowed all the stink to escape.4. The diapers always stacked on top of one another. I would have to shake the pail to get them to spread out, but even then it didn't hold much (or it didn't seem that way with twins).Here's my list of things I liked:1. It used regular garbage bags"
1,"Should be called the stinky, dirty champ","Poop gets all over this disposal, the smell is atrocious. Spend the extra $ for the genie & refills...less poop smeared everywhere!"
1,I HATE THIS THING!,"I absolutely hate this thing. First all the little hole on top is too small for all but the tiniest newborn diapers. So, you have to fold the darn things into these little compact bundles, getting baby poo and pee all over your hands. Then you cram it in the tiny little hole and poop inevitably gets all over the hole. And if the pail is the least bit full, the lid won't flip. So, yes, you need to take out the diaper and wriggle the handle. All this defeats the purpose of having a ""hands-free"" diaper pail! Get a regular old trash can with a pedal on the front, stick in a air-freshener, and save yourself some time and money."
5,LOVE IT - So easy to use,"I like this much more than the Diaper Genie. I have both, one upstairs and one downstairs. When my husband changes the baby's diaper upstairs, he won't use the diaper Genie, he runs the diaper down to the diaper champ. So very easy to install the garbage bag and unload the dirty diapers. We change it about 2 times a week. Keeps the smell away and again - SUPER easy to use. Just put in a large size kitchen garbage bag."
5,All I can say is wow!,"I also went with the diaper champ because the price was lower and we could use our own bags. For the first 6 weeks that our daughter was home, seeing as her room was not finished, we set up our pack and play with the changing station in the living room. As one might imagine with a newborn, we had people in and out several times per day. No one even noticed that there was a diaper pail in the living room! No odors, and it holds quite a few dirty diapers, we LOVE this product!"
5,I love this pail!!!,"This product is great! I have not had any problems with it at all. No odor, one handed operation, and I have not had to buy any bags since I purchased a large roll of generic garbage bags five months ago when my daughter was born. I still have half a roll of bags to go. All of my friends with diaper genies wish they had my Diaper Champ. They are spending so much money on bag refills."
2,Saves Money But Smells Funny !,"The Diaper Champ worked ok for a while. After we washed it down for sanitary reasons, and let it dry thoroughly, the seal seemed to weaken and let incredible odors out! We switched to the Diaper Genie and are completely satisfied with it. No more odors!"
2,Save your money....,"I have a 3yr old & 4mo old. I purchased this one because my other diaper pail broke. I thought this one would keep the odors out because of its design...well I was wrong. My complaints with this diaper pail are: hard to open, Size(to large), Odors(not good for #2 diapers..Ok for #1 diapers), & easy for toys to get thrown away in there(my 3yr loves to put toys in it). I am now using the kitchen trash again because it gets dumped everyday(no odor has time to build up and I put the #2 diapers outside right away). I hope this review has helped someone...save money an use your trash can."
3,"Good container, watch using diaper bags","I put this on my baby registry after reading all of the favorable reviews. I agree with the pros - nice to be able to use standard trash bags, seems to contain the smell well and is easy to assemble/use. The cons: if you are using something like the Sassy bags for #2 diapers, they get caught up in the turning mechanism. This is quite frustrating, particularly in the middle of the night while holding the baby and trying to do one-hand disposal! Also, it is a bit smaller than I envisioned, so we have to empty it pretty much each day. I have not used any other diaper disposal system, so I do not have a point of comparison, but I would recommend researching other options to see if they address the cons of this one."
2,Not great for cloth diapering,"We bought this because we heard it can be used for cloth diapering as well as disposables. It works well for disposables, keeps smells in, uses any bag etc - all the good things people say. But for cloth, we found the bin to be too small and would fill up fast. And the cloth diapers have a way of jamming in the flip top part - so we'd end up just opening the whole thing up every time we had to change a diaper which completely defeated the purpose. If you're using disposables, this this is great. But if you're cloth diapering, a regular garbage can with a loose fitting lid works much better."
2,Only good for disposable diapers.,"Dh and I loved this pail until we went up to the first size of 4X8X4 cloth diapers. They were too big for the drum to turn effectively, and the diapers often got stuck. We tossed it and bought a plain old pail. I suppose it could also be a problem with the last two sizes of disposables."
4,Better than the Genie!,"This is my second baby, and I loathe the diaper genie. It stinks, it's difficult to empty, and the refills are expensive. This was an interesting alternative, and the reviews were good, so I bought it. I'm really glad I did! It's easy to use and easy to empty. I found that Glad Tall Kitchen QuickTie 13 Gallon bags work the best with the Diaper Champ. They are the right size, and you can buy them in boxes of 96. The taller kitchen bags are just too big. My only complaint is that when the Champ starts to get full, the weight that pushes the diaper down into the can loses some of it's pushing power. Then sometimes I have to manually push the weight down, and I really don't care to have my hand in the diaper pail, if you know what I mean. This problem is really not a big deal, and it just signals that it is time to change the bag. My daughter is breastfed, and her stools don't smell yet. So I can't tell what the smell factor will be on stinky diapers."
1,Whats Wrong With The Good Ol' Trash Can???,"I have decided that I need a racket like these to make me rich, something that new parents think they have to have for their little one. I know in my house we empty our trash atleast 1x a day, sometimes we get a day and 1/2 out of it. I assure you, this is MORE than you will ever change your Diaper Champ, Diaper Genie or any other diaper pail specifically used for diapers. It can take quite a few days to fill it up.....and then people complain that it smells?? Hmm... Get a new Kitchen trash can with a lid.Avoid these things they are more headache than they are worth."
5,Relief from the stink!,"I would definitely recommend choosing the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie, since you can use regular kitchen trash bags instead of expensive Genie refills. Definitely reduces the odor (just be prepared for the awful smell when you open the top to change the bag!!!) and is easy to clean. Love it!!!"
1,Not Worth IT,"This pail for some reason smells no matter how well you wash it, no matter what you use to wash it!! A friend of mine has the same problem with her Diaper Champ. It doesnt hold the liner well, the tube gets stuck and it SMELLS! I found that using my kitchen garbage can works fine and cost $3.00, the kitchen garbage goes out every night so there is no smell, no hassle and costs less."
4,"Works fairly good,saves money","The main reason I got the diaper champ is to 'SAVE MONEY', and save on trips to the store to buy liners,bags,etc. I found out later as I started using it that it is FAIRLY ODOR FREE TOO, a plus point. I have been using it since a year for my first born. When poop started getting smellier, my husband's complaint was that the baby's room smelled, but the problem was solved after we started keeping the champ outside the baby room's door and also started emptying it daily. If you want a 90-100% smell free room this is not the diaper pail for you. Also, it holds only a day or two's diapers at the most, so frequent emptying is necessary."
2,You could just use a cute garbage pail,"We saw this diaper pail and thought it was neat looking, easy to use,and did not take extra bags. So we registered for it and recieved it as a shower gift. I bought vanilla scented bags and have used it regularly.I keep it very clean but it does not matter you can still smell a poopy diaper that you rolled up and put in it hours later. It just does not keep the smell in the can.My daughters room just smells like used diapers. i would be better off putting a cute garbage can in there and throwing the dirties outside every night like you do with kitty litter."
1,Gag on the odor!,"I have been using this product now for 12 months. It was great for the first 8 or so, but now, I could gag every time I walk into my daughters room. It is easy to use, but ease is not the issue when you feel like throwing up every time you change a diaper. I have tried everything. Bleach, baking soda, ""odor obsorbing"" trash bags, Lysol and even a ""Stick-up"". Nothing works now, the odor is a constant. I change the bag 4 times a week (that is the other draw back, does not hold much) so it is not like there is tons of filth just piling up in there. I am currently looking for something else, but after reading the reviews on the other products, nothing sounds very good!"
2,just ok,"It works ok. I've had it for a few months - I bought it based on its positive reviews in baby bargains, but I'm going to find something else. The biggest drawback is that a couple days after emptying it, stuff starts getting stuck in the device so that you have to open it up and wrench poopy wet wipes unstuck...defeats the purpose of an airtight bin.I haven't compared it with other bins, so I couldn't say whether it's the lesser of evils, but hopefully there's something better out there for the job."
1,Stinky Option,"The diaper champ worked great for the first few months. However, when the diapers started getting messier the poop from the diapers smears against the plastic chute if you don't wrap the diaper perfectly before disposing of it. Sure, you can not smell the diapers from inside the container, but the poop stuck in the chute is enough to smell up any room and I did not want to wash the diaper champ every day... I got the diaper genie a few months ago and like it much better."
3,Broke my nails,"I found this pail to be heavy without anything in it. I found that it took up too much space. I find myself using a regular small garbage pail and I don't smell any odors (and all of my windows are closed). dislike the mechanism for opening this pail, when I opened this pail for the first time, I broke two of my nails, I tried opening again and it was still hard on the fingers and nails. My son is only two months and perhaps I need a diaper pail later on, but for right now, I am going to use a regular garbage pail."
2,ODOR AND FILLS QUICK,"My baby is two weeks old and I CAN SMELL the accrual of diapers, after the third day you can definitely start to smell a faint odor from all the diapers. However, since I have more than one diaper disposal system in my home it wasn't even full however, it began to smell and didn't push the diapers all the way down. The lever that supposed to push them down just sits on top of them and when you empty the bag there is still tons of room. If you are going to change the diaper champ every single day then you might want to buy it."
2,Diaper Champ STINKS!!!!!! Literally!,"This is just a fancy trashcan, because it smells bad once you put a dirty diaper in there!! Everytime you flip the handle you get a whiff of what is underneath! Which would be dirty diapers! If you dont empty it everyday the scent lingers! It is not just my sensitive nose, but this thing can really stink up a room. I clean it every 2 days with Clorox Clean up, Oust odor spray, and put a citrus stick up inside , and it STILL knocks me out with letting the stench escape! I have used this product for 7 weeks, and Im ready to put it out in the garage and use it as the downstairs ""diaper pail"" NOT IN THE HOUSE it stinks too bad! The diaper Champ is not such a knockout! IM heading for the genie!!!!!!!!"
1,This STINKS!!!,"Everytime I use this system I have to use my hand to force the diaper in the pail. Also the seal broke and the smell is aweful!!!!! The seal was broke wihtin the first month and now I am looking to find a new diaper dispisal....this product is no champ, it gets a KO (knock out) not an OK from me!"
3,Good if you need it,"I bought this for my third baby since we had moved into a two story, I felt that I had to have a diaper pail in the baby's room. I had the genie with my second, but hated buying the refils, so I had gotten rid of that long before..I used it some in the first months, but his diapers really weren't that stinky ( breastfed)so odor wasn't really a factor. Then as he got older we were always changing him down on the main floor then walking out the garage and putting it in the garbage if stinky..Buying the champ was pretty much a wast of money for me. I took it to OUAC today and they had never seen it before and seemed impressed with it, only to give me [a few dollars] for it!!!!!!Other than that, if you really need to keep a diaper pail in the baby's room, then it does seem to keep the smell in pretty good."
4,The best on the market!!,"This is a really good product. No odor, no mess. The lid is a little hard to open, and it doesn't hold a lot, but there is no smell in my babies room, and no special bags. Overall a winner!"
5,Hey This Was The One,"I loved this compared to the genie. It is easier to use and less costly in the long run!!Two thumbs up!!!Now, only if it would spray a freshner on its own. LOL!!!"
2,smelly,I have a 2 year old; I stopped using the diaper champ when he turned about 1. The smell was awful. I tried leaving an air fresher in the pail but it still did not help. I even called the Baby Trend (they where extremely helpful) about a gasket replacement since mine tore and smelled. And that did not help. We finally just gave up on it.
2,"It's ok, but watch your fingers and hold your nose!","when changing the bags it's easy to pinch your fingers when opening the cover. it's also stinky. there's no barrier from the rotating portion and the diapers so when the diapers get close to the top it can get pretty stinky...yes, change it often and wash it often. once baby is eating solid food it's tough keeping it from smelling. i wipe daily and wash out once a week, and also change the bag at least 2x's a week. there's got to be something better!"
5,LOVE IT!!!,"As we were getting ready to have our first child, the cost to get everything we would need was huge! After reseaching and reading reviews and factoring the cost of replacement bags for other diaper pails, we opted for the Diaper Champ! It works like a champ! We buy the bags in boxes of 20 scented bags at the Dollar Tree and have never had an odor problem. We empty it twice a week, wipe it down and continue on. We would recommend to everyone! A huge cost saver!"
5,Works for cloth diapers too,"I used this for disposables with my newborn and it worked great!When my baby was 2 months old we switched to cloth diapers and I continued to use it. I line it with a regular trash bag and wash the diapers every other day.When we switched to cloth diapers we were concerned that it would be really smelly. But because we use the ""dry pail"" system (we don't soak them in a pail), using the Diaper Champ there is no ""diaper pail"" odor at all! (I was amazed!)This was recommended to me by my sister and I agree. This should be on everyone's baby registry whether you're using disposables or cloth. Don't bother with the competition...just get the Diaper Champ. You won't be disappointed."
5,better than diaper genie,"i love this diaper champ..not only does it save money on bags cause you use whatever brand you want it is bigger so it holds more and i havent had a smell come out of it! My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!! Another nice thing about it is you can put other items in it besides just diapers, and unlike the diaper genie you dont have to push down and smoush the diaper to get it in. Wonderful item!! (as you can tell i have use the diaper genie with my first child) totally recommend the diaper champ!!!"
5,a must have,"I love this product. You can use any regular trash bag. So far we have noticed NO odors. It is easy to use. It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ. The price is very affordable as well."
4,Diaper Champ,I really like the fact that you can use any bag with handles so no more [costly] refills. But I have noticed that it is not odor free. You do have to remember to thoroughly clean it every other time you change the bag. But I have owned a Diaper Genie and I would happily buy another one of these over that because of the money saved on refills.
3,Great for the first year!,"We have used the Diaper Champ for a year now. It was fantastic at the beginning of our daughter's life. It held smells well, it was easy to use, empty, and clean. Now that her diet has changed to the same foods we eat, her diapers are pretty stinky. The Diaper Champ has held up to now, but we are considering a change. The odor coming from her room after even 1 diaper is awful. We are constantly buring candles in her room to help and we have even started bagging the diapers in plastic baggies before we deposit them in the Diaper Champ. Nothing seems to help. We change this at least 1x a week, if not 2x and it still stinks."
3,Doesn't lock the odors in!,"I love the diaper champ for how many diapers it holds and the fact you don't have to buy special bags for it, but it doesn not keep in the odors. I feel like I have to change the bag more often so I don't know how much I'm really saving by not buying the special bags that a diaper genie requires. I spray the pail after every use and have cleaned it out with bleach and it still smells. Great idea but it just doesn't work. I haven't gone back to the diaper genie yet...is there anything else out there that works?"
5,WONDERFUL DIAPER PAIL,"We were originally not planning to buy or register for a diaper pail until we saw this one on a friend's registry. I was interested in it since it uses regular garbage bags. Let me tell you...it is WONDERFUL!!! You don't realize how great the odor control is until you change the bag and wow does it work well!! Easy to use, eliminates odor, uses regular bags, affordable.......I highly recommend it!!"
1,Who let the STINK OUT!!!,"We bought the Diaper Champ to start with because of the every day trash bags you can use, the holding capicity, ease of use, etc, etc. Boy were we suckered. We have been using this product for 7 and a half months, and that has been about 3 to 4 months to LONG!!! As soon as my daughter started solids, the smell has been slowly creeping up a little bit more every day. Now that thing is stinking the whole house up. It has no odor control at all. I will say it worked great for a breastfeed baby. Unless you plan to feed him or her forever off you. Plan on buying a 2nd system down the road to replace this one. I'd say look for something else! if you want a one and only investment!"
1,SUPER SMELLY!!!,I would not recommend this to anyone! Its really easy but it smells all the time. You could smell it down the hallway it was so bad. We even bought the air fresheners that you plug into the wall and it didn't improve the smell at all. I still use it for wet diapers but if there is a dirty one I take it outside to the trash can so it doesn't smell up my house.Try anything but the diaper champ.
2,Easy but Smelly,"This is easy, but horribly smelly. I suggest saving your money and buying a regular trash can. You will get the same effect, because this doesn't do anything special."
5,Great for diapers,"This model is great! You don't have to purchase extra materials for the Diaper Champ, you can use your own trash bags. I do recommend that you buy an air freshner because the Diaper Champ doesn't completely hide the smell."
4,No smells!!!,"This is a great pail except for the heavy lid. Be careful when changing the bag so it doesn't come down on your hand. The seal did come out, but it does not affect the odor. This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days. I wish it was a little bigger.I do recommend this pail!!!"
3,Worked well in the beginning,I have not used a Diaper Genie or any of the other systems. The diaper champ worked well before my daughter started on solids and the diaper started to really stink. Now the poopy diapers go in a plastic bag tied and in the outside trash. The champ really does not keep the smell out. We only use the champ for wet diapers. Another annoying thing is that the diapers often get stuck when you try to turn the handle. We found that you need to shake the pail every once in a while so it makes more room and then it works.It is great that you can use regular bags. You can change the bags more often and this helps.
5,THE BEST AVAILABLE!,I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS DOESN'T HAVE MORE REVIEWS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO MESS AROUND WITH DIAPER GENIE REFILL BAGS THIS IS FOR YOU. IT HOLDS A LOT OF DIRTY DIAPERS (I WOULD SAY AROUND 40 TEN MONTH OLD BABY DIAPERS). IT DOES NOT LET ODOR OUT AND IS SOOOO EASY TO USE. ALL YOU NEED IS 30 GALLON TRASH BAGS - NO REFILLS. WHY DOES EVERY DIAPER NEED TO BE INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED ANYWAY???
2,Stinky,I do admit I like the idea of using regular trash bags but the oder that it leaves is horrible. I couldn't stand the smell any longer and got rid of the Diaper Champ! It is much easier to take out the trash once a day than live with a smelly room. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT NEWBORNS DO NOT HAVE SMELLY DIAPERS! So of course you will not smell anything until your little one starts to eat more solid foods. It is just disgusting! I highly recommend saving yourself $30 and taking the trash out once a day.
5,Diaper Champ does what its supposed to do!,"After reading multiple reviews, we decided to buy the Diaper Champ right before the adoption of our two babies became final. That was over a year ago, and the Diaper Champ would still be my product of choice. It's expensive enough to BUY diapers never mind having to buy those ""special"" (and expensive) diaper bags used in other products. The maintenance price is ridiculous! We don't put poopy diapers in the Diaper Champ, change it regularly and spray it with Lysol. My house NEVER smells like dirty diapers. It's totally unrealistic to expect anything more from a container that contains human waste!!"
2,The dumpster will always be best,"My son is 17 months old now and the thing with diaper pails is that the dumptser outside will always be the best place for those solid-food-eating stinky diapers. We've had this one from the beginning, and it's good enough for wet diapers, but we don't dare put stinky diapers in there. Even with only putting wet diapers in, when we change out the bag, we let the pail sit outside, opened up and sprayed with lysol overnight before putting a new bag in and putting it back in the house. I just don't know that you can really expect ""odor-free"" from any diaper pail.That said, we've been satisfied enough with this pail, but then just yesterday the foam lining on the top came out. I'm sure the smell factor will worsen now, so, trying to decide with another baby on the way if we'll buy yet another one of these or go with a different pail that requires expensive bags--???"
2,Really bad smells,"I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell. I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in. We have to change the bag every couple of days, when it is not even full because it is pretty disgusting.So just because of that I would not recommend it."
4,Diaper champ user for a year,"My son is now a year old and we still use our champ. It did start to stink when he was about 7 months old despite our efforts to wipe and spray it with every bag change. We took it apart and thoroughly scrubbed it and soaked the stinkiest parts. We realized that the foam piece holds the majority of the stink. After putting it back together, the foam piece eventually came loose and came out. I thought that it may not have a good seal without the foam but it actually works better without it. I'm happy to read that the foam came out for other people too - I thought I caused it to come loose when I washed it."
5,Its the champ!,We registered for the diaper champ mostly based on the reviews and the fact that no special bags were needed. I am very impressed with how easy it is to change the bag and I have not had any problems with smells. We use the odor guard trash bags but I doubt it has much effect (it doesn't in the kitchen anyway). The diaper champ is super easy to use and very cost effective. Would definitely recommend
1,The Worst Ye t,"We had the ""Champ"" (aka Chump) for less than 3 weeks before the odor became unbearable. Even tried using deodorized bags and had a Stick-Up in the diaper pail. And within the same time the tumbler started to stick - it wouldn't slide from one side to the other without an extra push. Save your money and your time - skip this dud!"
5,Great Product,"I like the one-hand functionality and it passes the odor test. Best of all, you don't need special expensive refill bags.Just make sure your diaper is wrapped closed or you'll have to clean the diaper shoot that goes into bag area."
3,Not Bad for 13 months..........,"Just wanted to put in my two cents. We loved our Diaper Champ for 12 months, then it just really started to smell. Our daughters room was rather stinky long after having changed a poopy diaper. So it has ended up in the trash and we are now using our Diaper Genie. It does not smell YET. Not sure that there is a perfect diaper disposal unit out there. The reason I am giving the Diaper Champ three stars is because it is really very easy to use, using our own trash bags was nice and it did the job for a year. I guess if I were in the market for a new system I would go ahead and give the new Neat System a try."
3,Diaper Champ is Okay,"This product is easy to put together and easy to use. Unfortunately, it is NOT odor free. I find it better to throw the diaper out in a plastic bag than to have the odor linger in the room."
4,Great product!,"We've used the Diaper Champ for 16 months with our son, and it's been great. The only time we've experienced odors was during the bag-changing process. I keep Lysol on hand to spray on the unit to keep germs to a minimum, but the only time the unit needs freshening is when you have to change out the bag. It's great that you can use regular kitchen trash bags too, and the pail holds a lot of dirty diapers. The only downside is that the bigger the diapers get, the harder they are to fit in the diaper space. My sister has 2 children, and is expecting her third. After using other diaper pails, she vows to buy the Diaper Champ for this baby. She remarks on how great it is every time she comes over to visit. Definitely worth the money."
3,Everything gets stuck when you flip it!,"At first I liked this compared to the Diaper genie. You put the diaper in the top, then flip the handle over and it is supposed to compress it and dump it in the bottom. However, after a while the diper and wipes get stuck when you flip the handle over. I have to pull them out by hand which is really gross! The problem gets worse as the pail gets full. Now I lift the lid everytime I use it. A regular trash can with a flip-top lip and a good seal would be better and probably a lot cheaper."
3,Good design... but it stinks!,I liked that you could use regular garbage bags with this product. The design is nice also. But boy does it stink! I have tried cleaning it with everything and it still smells. I have even placed deoderizers inside the pail. Still smells. I think I am going to have to buy something else.
2,Gets stuck all the time!,"Our Diaper Champ kept getting stuck, either on the diaper tape or something on the gasket. This is not a good thing, especially at 4am after very significant output from our daughter. The Diaper Champ does a great job of containing the smell, but only if you can get the diaper in there. :-( Also, Diaper Champ's customer support was very disappointing. We returned our Diaper Champ for a Diaper Dekor."
1,Diaper Chump,"This pail might be fine for disposables, but it's a pain if you're using cloth diapers and a service. It's really hard to keep clean (it gets pretty disgusting), it doesn't hold a whole week of diapers, the diapers fall in the middle and don't distribute evenly so it seems full before it is, and now that we're at the second size up (my baby's 5 months old) the diapers barely fit in the hole. I often end up just opening it completely and putting the diapers in underneath, bypassing the so-called handy one-hand flip method completely. I hate the thing. I'd throw it out but it's a lot of plastic to add to a landfill. I'd never recommend it to anyone using cloth!"
1,Stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,If you are a new mom or just in the market for a place to dispose of dirty diapers do not get this product. It does not contain the smell even after changing the bag daily. I hear the older models are much better. There is no tight seal and the smell just leaks out. Not worth the money. I stopped using this product after about 2 months. I now just tie up the diaper and put it in the trash!Waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Not Impressed,"I researched prior to purchasing the genie...loved it!! No smell. But the refills where an additional cost I didn't want to pay for. After the cutting mechanism broke on the genie I bought the champ. Yes it holds dirty diapers, yes you have to clean it, and yes it sits in our garage because the smell of dirty diapers is way too noticable. If you are worried about oder...don't get the champ. I will give it a thumbs up for convenience. My 18mo old puts her own diapers in the champ (in the garage) and turns the lever. Just don't let it get too full or you can't turn the lever...that makes since though doesn't it???"
2,"Great for newborns, too stinky for toddlers","Our son is 10 months old now and we finally had to toss the Champ. We originally bought it because we could use our own trash bags. We figured by changing it frequently, it would keep the odor away. But once our son started with the solids, we couldn't take it anymore. This unit is difficult to keep clean. If you don't stick the diaper tabs to the diaper properly, they get stuck on the unit."
2,Would be GREAT except.....,"We initially were very happy with the Diaper Champ- smell control was adequate, easy to use & cost effective to replace bags. BUT the foam(?) gasket that goes around the opening came apart after just a couple months. Then it became very difficult to turn the opening, kept sticking and getting caught. So we just finally took the gasket completely off which decreased the smell control. So we bought another one thinking that it must be a fluke but the same thing happened within a month! Our baby is only 7 months old and we have been through two Diaper Champs so we decided enough is enough and bought a Diper Dekor. We were disapointed because we didn't want to have to buy special refill bags plus we liked the easy design of the Diaper Champ, you could toss a diaper in one handed while your other hand was busy with baby, but the faulty gasket deal was too irritating."
3,For Better or Worse,I agree with most everybody. It is much cheaper to use this product than ones that take cartridges BUT I don't think that it helps with the odor as much as ones like Diaper Genie. The main reason we bought The Champ was that with the diaper Genie you had to shuve the diaper into the pocket area then twist and with a digestive system like my sons there ends up being more on you than in the diaper.
2,stinks and diapers get stuck,I've had tthis through two children now and I just hate the thing. It is great that you can use regular bags but it stinks and diapers constantly get stuck. neat idea but it fails in execution. to whoever said ignore bad reviews - it makes me wonder what planet you live on. If I paid $100 for this thing i would be upset
1,Stinky,"We've been using this diaper pail for two and a half years. It stinks. We decided to put it in the garage and just toss the diapers in the kitchen garbage, as it was getting taken out more frequently. I got tired of taking diapers into the kitchen though, and brought it back inside. After two days of using it again (with an air freshener in the bottom, my daughter's room stunk again. Also, when you toss wipes in without sticking them in a diaper they get stuck and cause the flipping action not to work. Then you find yourself pulling gross wipes out just to get the thing to flip over and sometimes you have to open it to pull them out. Opening it releases a nasty odor into the room which lingers for hours. I do not recommend this diaper pail if your goal is to keep the room from stinking."
2,good for only few months,"Well, I thought it was an OK product at first. It does seal out the orders reasonably well. However I do not recommend it, because after 6 month of use, the rubber part on top is coming off, making it impossible to use .Since I have read about this problem in other reviews, I do not believe its a fluke. Notice that most positive reviews are from people who have not had it very long. I will replace it with a stainless steel trash can. Save your money, do not buy this product, because it will break after few months ."
2,Regular cleaning and febreeze only kept the odor contained for 10 months......,"I had to rush out recently because the ""odor seal"" on the product had thinned out and has caused the dirty smell to linger throughout the house (I change the diaper bag regularly so it's not for lack of care). I bought the Safety 1st pail at Target yesterday that's battery operated.... I hope that this one will last us longer. Hope this review helps!"
2,stick comes through,We've had this for over a year...stick still fills the room...seal is not good enough to prevent a room full of odor.
2,gets stuck too often,We are using a diaper service and use the champ to collect and contain the diapers in the nursery. The champ tends to stick about half of the time. The diaper hangs from the cylinder mechanism and needs to be pulled through. I suggest using a trash can with a tight lid.
1,I hate it! It Smells!,"I bought this because my sister bought the original Diaper champ and loved it. Shortly after that I went to buy one and I had no choice but to buy the new and improved model ( At Babies R US, at amazon you can get the older model) . This is horrible! Imageine the worst smell and that's what you get in your bathroom or childs room ( wherever you store it ) . It is so embaressing to have company over bc you have to warn them about the smell in the bathroom. I agree, diapers do get stuck when turning and forget about throwing a pull up in there. It gets all trapped and is almost impossible to turn the lever. I deep clean this thing with lysol, clorox wipes and spray, and also I put it into the bath tub and scrub it. I don't think I should have to do that. When I contacted Baby Trend I got blown off. The guy could've cared less. If you're going to get one, get the older model off of here. My sister seems to be pretty pleased with hers."
3,No smell at first,"Though it doesn't smell as you are filling it, watch out when you go to change the bag. The smell is so strong I can't stomach it and my husband has to step in.I do think it is much easier to use then the diaper genie, but someone needs to come up with a deadorizer."
3,Small apartment.?.....too big and not needed.,This product is best suited for a large home or apartment. We live in a small apartment and registered for this diaper champ.I could not believe how big it was-huge! I decided to give it away to a friend who lived in a large size home. If you can easily get to your garbage can then save your money-this is not neccessary.
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!,"One star is one too many for this piece of crap. The Diaper Champ SUCKS!! I have zero praise to offer. It reeks of retained vile diaper odor AND the stupid design makes it very difficult to replace the bag with 2 hands. SAVE YOUR MONEY! You can have mine, it's on the curb waiting for the garbage collectors to come get it."
4,"Works great, but CLEAN IT.","Like anything that comes in contact with ""baby toxic waste"", you've got to clean it to use it properly. I keep a roll of garbage bags in the bottom of it and a can of Lysol next to it. I empty it daily and give the inside and the plunger (both sides) a quick spray of the Lysol. If I see a stain or smear of something, I just use a baby wipe to clean it off.Chances are if you smell something, it's because it's full or dirty and there is no product out there that works well when it exceeds it's capacity or isn't taken care of."
1,Not necessary,"I got this pail because I felt it was good that it doesn't require you to buy ""their"" garbage bags. But at the end I still didn't use it and just use a regular pail. Now it's sitting in my basement. The reason I didn't use it is because it is hard to open up the can to replace the bag and when you are actually cleaning a baby especially when it's #2 it is messy at times where you would probably get it in the pail before you flip the handle to dispose of it. Well then you now need to clean the pail as well as the baby. You don't need more work with a child."
2,Worked at first but not anymore,I bought the Champ because I didn't want to have to buy the special bags for the Genie and at first it worked great. Very easy just to flip the top with one hand. Sometimes a wipe would get stuck between the plunger and the outer lid and would need to be pulled out. One day when the Champ was only about 3 or 4 months old I pulled out what I thought was a wipe and it was the liner that had come disconnected. Ever since that liner came out it has not kept the odor in. I have been changing the bags every couple of days and dumping baby powder in the new bags to absorb the smell but I'm through playing around with this thing and I'm getting a different diaper pail.
2,"good at the beginning, awful later on","the diaper champ was really great at the beginning. no smell when closed, use own bags..., but oh my, we've had this pail now for a year and it STINKS! if you keep it in a well ventilated area like the bathroom (fan on and windows open) i guess i would recommend it, but if you keep the pail in the baby's room don't get it. not only does her soiled diapers' smell fill the room, but the pail itself starts to smell. i think it may be because they have foam lined inside the opening parts. in the end it's up to you, but i'm chucking mine out and getting something new...*PU*"
2,Very Disappointed,When I did research on diaper pails before my baby arrived I liked that you didn't have to buy refills and the smell didn't seem to be a big issue with the Diaper Champ. I didn't keep my receipt to return it but I'm going to spend another $30 to buy the Diaper Genie. The Diaper Champ is extrememly smelly and I feel that I can tolerate a lot. The most frustrating disappointment was that it was constantly jamming. I was constantly having to open the top and manually stuff the diaper down into the base. My friend bought the Diaper Champ as well and has also returned hers for the exact same reasons. The less expensive route with the Diaper Champ will now cost me double when I purchase the Diaper Genie.
1,All I can say is - P U,The Diaper Champ is a champ for smelling up the room. Don't waste your money.
3,More Champ than Chump,"After the first 6 months I would have been rating this diaper pail top of the heap. Certainly not having to buy special bags is a HUGE advantage... and the hole is larger that the genie so you don't have to worry about the ""squish"" factor as much.The problem, and the reason others had a smell problem is that this pail has large foam washers and a foam pad in the top section that get rank after time. Luckily we just called the company and they sent new ones and the smell went when they did, but it was a bit of a pain. I still think it was worth it to buy this one!"
4,Overall satisfied,"I loved this product while it still worked! There is a foam pad inside that keeps the smell from escaping. Mine kept my son's room odor free until the foam broke down, which took about a year. Currently, I am getting ready to use the same one over again for my second child. I still highly recomend this product and in fact, I have purchased it again for a friend's baby shower!"
2,I wont buy this again,"I used diaper champ for past 3 yrs for my first kid. Poo Poo diapers when not put in the lid properly, gets the DC's lid soiled. Its so unhygenic to touch all that and clean it. And its difficult to clean the crevices of the lid.So, most of the times, we open the DC and put the Poo soiled diapers. It also does not contain odor. Always had it in the bathroom.I gave it 2 stars, because this one is ok for the non-stool diapers and is economical. Now that Im expecting another one, Im reasearching to buy something else."
4,Very happy.,"I love this product. It is so easy to use and there are no refills. I can use any kind of kitchen bag. There is a smell of course when you change the bag, but it is no big deal, it is just until you tie up the bag."
4,So easy and convenient to use!!!!,"The diaper genie is so easy to use; one handed operation. No additional cost since it uses regular bags. It's easy, easy, easy! Have had no problem (yet) with odor."
2,Not as good as everyone thinks it is!!!,We received this last year as a baby shower gift for out twin boys. It worked for about 4 or 5 months. When it got close to being full you could smell it. Now it doesn't matter if you have 1 or 20 diapers in it! It stinks to high heaven!!! Now I am looking for a better one than this one. Tried the diaper genie...hated it...got any suggestions???
1,No Good!,I bought the Champ diaper pail because you can use any bags. What a mistake! I should have done my research. The smell that lingers in the room is unbearable. I finally bought the Neat Diaper Disposal it might require cassettes but at lease there is nor more stinky smell in my son's room.
3,Great until Toddlerhood...,"I was very happy with the Diaper Champ for a long time. I loved being able to use regular garbage bags, changing the bags was easy, and easy to empty. Very simple to put the diapers in. We did have to replace the sponge ""gaskets"" twice before putting the Diaper Champ to the curb. Once our child was on table foods this diaper pail does not work anymore! Even with cleaning it and letting it air out for a day. It literally made the whole house stink!So out to the curb it went and got something else. There is absolutely no smell w/ the different diaper pail."
1,if you like a stinky house this one is for you!,After stuggling with poopy smell for 9 months I finally gave in and bought a Diaper Genie. What a difference!I like that Champ is easy to use and cheap (no special expensive refill bags) but it didn't do one thing that it was created to do: keep the house smell free!It's in my basement now! A completely useless product!
3,Not impressed,"I don't think this pail really did everything I was expecting, which was based on the content they provided on their site. I had a hard time opening and closing it, and honestly the smells containment was not any greater than a normal trash bin. Cute design, but not worthy of higher expectations."
3,Not so Good for Cloth Diapers,"We use this to house our son's cloth diapers before the wash. This does a good job, the only problem is the diaper strap gets stuck when you turn the handle over and the weight pushes it down between the lid and the opening. As far as smell goes it only gets bad if you don't clean as much as you can off the diaper and periodically clean out the bin. Other than that it's a rather good container for diapers."
1,It stinks so bad~,This pail was given to me as a gift. when I had my first child. Well he is 2 now and I have a baby girl who will be turning one next month and I have to say it is the most worse diaper pail in the world. Not only do I have to change the pail every other day. But it likes to hold in the smell. I have done everything from bleaching it. Scrubbing it. Soap. White Vinegar. i even let it sit outside in sun. Cause I live in sunny FL. And that didn't help Instead it ends up bringing in these nasty flies. Now I am shopping around for another one. Cause my son is going to potty training and I can't stand the smell no more. it stinks up my whole bathroom and bedroom. Its disgusting. From all the cleaning and everything. It cause it to crack on the top. I am very dissappointed in the product and will not buy another one of these.
5,"Wishes Granted: no refills, no fuss, no smell","The flip action is so easy to use that even your toddler (or your foot) can do it to make diapers and smell disapper. (Now that my baby is older and stinkier, I notice a faint smell if I stand right over it, but I just sprinkle some baking soda in the bag, or you could but a couple charcoal brickettes in the bottom, or any other of the 101 odor absorbing remedies out there.)And practically speaking, stratch another item off that long baby shopping list--with this you can forget the diaper pail refills and just use the good old kitchen garbage bags that are sitting under your sink."
1,Please read before purchasing . . .,"If you are like me you research and research before you purchase a product. Many of the online reviews raved about how well this product eliminating the diaper odor. However, I do not agree with the raving reviews. For the first couple of month this product worked at eliminating the diaper odor, but after a few months you would have found this item out on my porch to air out. Even after cleaing it once a week - It did not trap the smelly diaper odor. I just don't feel for the amount of money this was it was worth cleaning more than once a week. I should of just purchased a rubbermaid trash bin. I personally would not recommend this product."
2,Diaper Champ? The smell WILL knock you out!,"When shopping around for a diaper pail I was drawn to the Diaper Champ for several reasons. 1) I loved the idea of using regular plastic bags from the grocery store. 2) The one-hand chute is quick and easy to use while dealing with a squirming baby. 3) I'd heard negative reviews about the Diaper Genie. Now that I've had the Diaper Champ for 8 months, I'm looking for a diaper pail that lives up to its name.About 2 months ago the chute began to stick and the pail began to release unpleasant fumes each time I'd drop a diaper in. The inner lining had come loose and was preventing diapers from dropping down into the bag. Eventually, the lining just fell out and that's when the smell became unbearable. Not only is my daughter's nursery filled with odors strong enough to give you a headache, the smell is seeping into the hall and down the stairs.Our Diaper Champ is on its way to the recycle bin. It won't be returning for a come-back fight."
2,Smelly in the long run!,I received this diaper champ as a gift and at first it was great. Now that my baby is 9 months old her room is starting to smell. Since the diaper champ doesn't individually wrap each diaper the smell starts getting bad. I would suggest you spend the extra 10 to 20 bucks and get a diaper product that individually wraps each diaper!
3,OK,"I purchased this pail because I wanted to have the option to use regular trash bags to refill it instead of the expensive custom diaper pail refills. The pail is ok but does not have a lot of space and fills up quickly. Also, the handle does get stuck quite often. Baby wipes tend to get stuck in the flip top and shoot back up at you. To open the main compartment takes a bit of wrangling as it is a button that has to be pressed while lifting up the lid. After 6 months of use I'm not really happy with the overall design, ease of use and will be purchasing a different system."
3,Contains smell but....,My daughter is now 20 months old. This unit does control the smell but wipes get stuck and sometimes diapers so that you have to move it back and forth to get the thing to move and get rid of the diaper. If I have to open it up and pull out the dirty wipes just to get the thing to move how sanitary is that? It is worse when it gets full but still. Also after using for this long the smell when I open it is overwhelming. The plastic just seems to hold the ammonia smell. And I only use it for Pee diapers. You can Lysol or bleach or whatever but its BAD when you are changing the bags. I'm pregnant with #2 and looking for something else. With 2 sets of diapers its just going to be too much.
5,Dream Come True!,"100% perfect. I am a Dad and this should REALLY be taken into consideration for fellow Dads. The most IMPORTANT thing for me is that you don't have to buy those refill bags like the diaper genie. This thing uses REGULAR TRASH BAGS! This thing is SO easy to use it's unbelievable. Take a Dad's word for it... GET THIS. And another thing, it only smells when you open the sealed lid to change the bag."
4,better than diaper genie,"I used the diaper genie with my first son and was not impressed. This is total different. There are no weird bags and twisting - and it was smelly. With the diaper champ you use a normal kitchen trash bag - I buy the vanilla scented ones. We have been using it for a little over 8 months now and it has started to smell a little (that's why not 5 stars), I did clean it up with bleach and let it sit outside to air out and now it is much improved. I don't think you can totally avoid all smells, especially after they start eatting real foods and having more solid poops. It is the best one I have found."
4,Better than the competition,"I have owned a Diaper Dekor and now a Diaper Champ. I prefer the Diaper Champ because it does not utilize expensive refills and it keeps the odor in better than the Diaper Dekor. The Diaper Dekor broke, the arm that lifts the lid up broke off. So I had to go searching for a new product again since they discontinued the model that I was using. I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check. Let's face it, even the best can't keep in that smell, especially as your child gets older. I have two children now, so the Diaper Champ is getting utilized quite a bit and it beats the competition hands down."
5,Easy to Use & Empty - No Smell !!!,"There is minimal smell, you can use tall kitchen bags, and it's so easy to use and empty - this is a GREAT product. I was in line at BRU, and two other mothers just nodded their heads and praised the Diaper Champ. I got it, and I'll be doing the same to other newbee mommys out there!"
3,Ok at first - we are on our 2nd,I did love this product for the first year. but my oldest is 3years old and we've been through two of these and now off to buy something else for my 15 month old. The seal on the cover doesn't last long which is why it smells. When we first get the new one it works great for a few months and then it starts smelling. We change it every other day and my 3 year old is potty trained so I'm only using it with one toddler. The fact that you don't need to buy special bags is great but I wish they would figure out a better way to contain the smells.
2,Stinks!,"I also had heard the rave reviews about the Diaper Champ versus the Genie. So I got two Champs with the birth of my daughter. When we had to begin shutting the nursery door after our cat was jumping in the crib, the diaper smell upon opening the door was almost unbearable. Yes, I do change it 2x per week and wipe it completely down but I still notice the smell. I was sold on the usage of regular garbage bags with it but I realize that may be part of the problem. There is nothing sealing the smells in. The flip top system, while fun and novel at the beginning, can be a pain. If the tabs of the diaper are not securely wrapped around the diaper they will get stuck in the tube and you have to open it up, thus releasing the stench. Friends have said they don't go through the Genie refills as quickly as I had feared, which was one of my reservations about it. If I had to do it again, I would probably go with the Genie."
3,"The best option out there, but still not perfect","I truly believe this is the best diaper pail on the market... It's simple to use, can take any garbage bag, and does a fantastic job of containing odors. BUT, my complaint is -- why couldn't they make it bigger?I've heard it's the biggest one you can buy, but I find it frustrating that my regular kitchen-sized garbage bags are only 2/3 full when the Diaper Champ requires us to remove the bag. It's wasteful! (I know the simple solution is to buy smaller bags, but I feel the product should accomodate the most common household garbage bag -- the ""tall kitchen bags"" -- and do it efficiently. The whole point of getting the Diaper Champ was so that we wouldn't have to buy separate bags for it!)"
2,Doesn't work with cloth diapers,We use cloth diapers and the compartment that flips around to drop it into the pail was not big enough. The diapers got caught in it and ripped the gasket off causing the pail to malfunction. We had to return it which just puts plastic in the landfill. It is very difficult to work the latch/blue clip to open the pail. My guess it that it would work much better for disposables.
2,Nice try...but can't beat the Diaper Genie,"We bought this in desperation because we couldn't figure out how the diaper genie works. During a visit with family, my brother-in-law showed us how to use the Genie. We then put the Diaper Champ in our baby's room and the Genie in the bathroom.There really is an odor problem with the Diaper Champ. We ended up using the Genie for Dirty Diapers and the Champ for Wet diapers only.I went online to see the reviews and I am amazed to find similar experiences. Truly Honest reviews.1. Gives off too much odor2. Tough to open3. Takes too much spaceI'm a clean freak and I use Clorox on everything. The smell disappears for a day but will soon start again once a single dirty diaper stays overnight in the Champ."
1,Diaper Champ? More like Diaper Loser!,"I bought the Diaper Champ because it was recommended to us over the Diaper Genie. 2 weeks after using it we decided it wasn't for us. It didn't hold the smells in AT ALL! Tried using scented garbage bags and that didn't help! Our room still stunk! I bought the Diaper Genie and while it does't keep the smells in 100% (you can still smell it when you open it to put another diaper in) and you have to buy the refill bags, it works a lot better than the Diaper Champ and the room smells a lot better than it did before."
3,Good for 18 months,"I absolutely loved our diaper champ up until now. I loved just using trash bags. It is very easy to deposit the diapers with one hand. And, it never had an odor. Until now. My son is 20 months old and over the past 2 months we have started to notice a slight odor. The seal around the piston isn't in the correct place anymore and I think that is why it smells. However, I am going to buy another one after reading all the reviews on the Diaper Genie and the Neat system. I have issues with paying for refills when trash bags are much cheaper! Not to mention, I really liked it up until now. With our second child on the way, I'm still a supporter of the Champ!"
2,the smell all depends on your child's age,"This pail was great when my baby only ate formula. As this is a hectic time, I found it very convenient to use the same garbage bags that I used for my kitchen. But once my baby started eating solid food - WHEW!!!!! The whole house smelled!!!! We have since purchased a diaper genie ... and it is still the master!"
3,not too impressed,"Overall i was not impressed. It isnt easy getting the dirty diapers into the pail using the lid. The diapers usually get hung up or caught and it takes several tries to get it to fall down into the pail. No matter how often I emptied it it always smelled. I liked being able to use garbage bags however, it was easy to change out. I ended up not using it and just putting the diapers into the regular garbage."
3,Good idea but needs some adjustments to design,"The premise is good - grocery shopping bags are used so there is no expense. There really is no odor while the diapers are in the pail and it is closed. But..it is REALLY hard to open the unit to change the bag, and if you forget...!! Advisable to spray the unit when changing the bag because the interior DOES hold the smell! Baby Trend, make this easier to open and less flimsy in the back attachment. Mine cracked early on and I am awaiting a replacement."
5,Great at hiding the Smell,"I love this item, I had considered the Genie but thought about the expense of all those bags you have to buy and didn't think I needed the extra expense. My baby was a preemie and the champ held all her tiny little diapers, she is 6 1/2 months old now and her diapers are much larger but we still manage to go a few days before changing the bag. I would recommend this to anyone and am very glad at the choice I made."
3,Odorous - gets jammed,"Good product, but does not contain odor and frequently jams if you don't push it down all the way or if a diaper tab or wipe gets stuck in between which happens all the time. We put a deodorizer in the bottom of the pail and this has helped eliminate the odor."
3,Stinky and sometimes messy,"Our experiences with the Champ have been mixed. Not only have diapers gotten stuck in the cylinder and been torn in the ""dropping"" process, but they also get stuck when the champ is moderately full. The odor does leak quite often when in a small space (the closet) or even when in the bedroom. Not to mention the pure stench when changing bags. It's enough to knock out a postpartum mom with strong ""smell indicators"" still working.The convenience of using regular garbage bags is definitley the biggest plus in this contraption."
2,Easy to use but it STINKS!,"I really liked it in the beginning, especially how easy it was to use. But as time has gone by, it has really begun to allow odors to escape, or it is absorbing them I don't know which, but it really SMELLS! I finally took it out of my baby's room because it was almost toxic and would blow you away when you walked in the room, no matter how often I changed the bags. I'll be buying something else this weekend."
2,It started out nice,"We have had the champ almost a year now and at first it was great we used regular kitchen trash bags, but recently it just hit stink mode. I think it has to do with the seal on the chute I can see that it has torn off, it looks like yellow foam material. I checked the warranty and it is conveniently for only six months. I have a feeling the manufacturers know about this little problem. That said it was a good product at first and I can see how early on it gets great reviews."
3,Some things are great but it does hold the smell!,"Bought this after my friend got one for her shower and loved it for a while. It is taller, holds more diapers, no special bags all those are great things but the smell does not disappear no matter how much you clean it and spray it with Lysol. BUT I used the Diaper Genie for 3 years as well and it has the same problem with the smell and still does not have the other benefits. There is not a perfect solution that I have found other than just hauling the diapers out daily to the outside trash can!"
1,Tried it--and ended up buying a diaper genie,"I believed the reviews of this product, and bought it when my baby was an infant. It worked very well while I was still breastfeeding, but once we started solid food, the smell was pretty bad. Each morning when we went into his room, the whole place smelled like diapers. Still, I resisted the diaper genie, because I didn't want to spend the money on the refills. However, by 10 months, we had enough, and finally bought a diaper genie. What a difference!! The only time smell escapes is when we empty it. To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell. If it is not worth it to you, just buy a regular garbage can--it will work just as well as the ""champ""."
3,Does not work well with washable diaper pail liners,"I bought the Diaper Champ with the understanding that it worked well with both cloth or disposable diapers - I'm planning to use cloth. I'm also using washable diaper pail liners (WAHMIES), and to my disappointment, I could not get the liners to work with the Diaper Champ. The liners were too bulky for it to close tightly. So I returned the Diaper Champ and ended up getting a Smart Can corner trash bin, which works fine (though the quality seems rather cheap, and it will undoubtedly not contain smells as well as the Diaper Champ). Just a head's up to those planning on using washable liners."
1,A disappointment,"This broke before my son was even 4 months old. The blue ring/seal around the top stopped working, which made it impossible to put more diapers into it. I called baby trend, and they emailed me instructions to fix it, but they didn't work. I have a friend with the exact same issue. Save your money and buy something else."
3,get the newer model,"I have not used this item yet for diapers, but as for my first inspection upon receiving this as a gift...I found that every time I moved the handle at the top, the unit wobbled due to the poor design- large at the top with a small base. I noticed that some online stores sell a new and improved design that has a larger base at the bottom- I purchased the newer model and no longer have the wobble problem."
2,Hidden mess/odor,"The Diaper Champ seemed like the perfect answer to the alternative with no special bags to buy & easy disposal (no twisting), and it was - for awhile. When the diapers get bigger, or if you have a messy one that leaks a bit as it's being pushed down into the system, BEWARE. We noticed that the odor coming from the Champ was stronger than normal even when we cleaned it & it was empty. Upon closer inspection we noticed that between the weight that pushes the diapers down, and the side of the 'chute' on the Champ, that there was quite a hidden mess. This mess was nearly impossible to clean and we were disgusted by it. Bottom line, this wasn't bad for a little while, but after seeing (and smelling) that disgusting mess, I'm going back for the Genie, expensive bags & all."
1,Doesn't sem like a champ to me,"I got the Diaper Genie as a shower gift and was disappointed, because of some bad reviews I did not think it would work. I took the Diaper Genie to my Mom's house, since she babysits during the day, and I purchased the Diaper Champ for my house. The Diaper Genie is still working at my Mom's house but the Champ was stinky and has since broken. I have purchased a Diper Genie for my house and it is working wonderfully all you have to do is follow the directions."
2,Did they really test this with cloth diapers?,"I received this as a gift, since I am planning to cloth diaper, and I played with it to figure it out. The hole for the diapers is too small! A *clean and carefully folded* non-infant cloth diaper fits into the receptacle with difficulty, and then stays stuck rather than dropping. A used diaper MIGHT fall more easily because of its extra weight, but it sure won't fit through the hole more easily. Who wants to fuss with a dirty diaper? I like the idea behind the Diaper Champ, and it's probably fine for disposables, but I'm returning mine for something more practical for cloth diapering."
2,"Good only for Newborn, doesn't work for toddlers","I purchased this diaper champs after Diaper Genie disappoints me. At first, it seems very good to me(when my daughter is a baby),very easy to use plus without spending money to buy special bags. Yet, as my daughter enters toddler's age, the diaper pail starts to smell really bad. I clean it once a week, plus using all kinds of spray, baking soda, etc. but nothing works. Even with a whole box of baking soday inside the diaper pail, it still smells really bad. I have to move it to a room that we don't use. I am serious looking for another diaper pail now. All the people who has good review on this product are not using it long enough. They must have a baby that is younger than 12 months. This product is only good for baby's first year."
1,P.U.,"Although the idea of not spending money on a pricey canister with refills may seem tempting, for my next child I am tossing this Diaper Champ and buying another brand. I have to keep it out in the garage, that's how bad it smells. Not worth the time, effort, and/or $$$. Keep Looking."
4,Great diaper pail no need for expensive refills,"It is easy to use and great because you can use regular garbage bags. It definitely does a good job of containing the odors for us. We have some friends who tried it and found that it didn't contain the odors for them. I think that it really depends on how smelly your baby's poops are. Looser stools tend to be smellier and messier. If it is leaking out of the diaper, it could touch the sides and cause odors that way as well. I have a 3 year old who just got potty trained and a 6 month old and was using the diaper champ for both of them and had no problem with odors. I also use Lysol after every bag change."
5,LOVE IT!!,I wasn't sure which to get between this and the Diaper Genie. I am so glad that I chose this one. I love that I can buy the scented bags of my choice. It really holds in the horrible diaper smell. I love it and wouldn't trade it in for anything.
2,Mine broke!!,"I loved the Diaper Champ until it would no longer work! We've only had it 2 and 1/2 months and it's broken. It could just be ours, but I thought I would write a review anyway. I don't think we'll buy another one. We'll just be grocery bagging it from now on!"
1,STINK,"I bought this product since we are expecting our second son and i thought we should try something new. The product allowed the smell of the diapers to leak through since the seal at the top wasn't secure. it's a neat design but not air tight enough and after only putting a few diapers in, we had to empty it, everytime!!!!! we're still looking for a solution and plan to try my sister's old diaper genie to see if that will work. regardless, this didn't do the trick."
4,Best buy in diaper pails !,"We debated on which pail to register for, but like most people, my husband didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags. That settled it for us and we got the diaper champ. It does do a pretty good job by itself containing odors, but we do take some extra steps to make sure it doesn't smell up my baby's room.1) For poopy diapers we use the inexpensive ""diaper disposal bags"" which are usually lightly scented and can make the diaper drop a little less messy.2) When we change the bag once a week or so, I wipe it out with an antibacterial wipe and then spray it with lysol or other type disinfectant spray.Then just let it air out a little and put in a new bag.This has worked like a charm so far!"
4,Good Product Overall,GOOD POINTS:Easy to operate and change.Less expensive to use than comperable products.Kept smell in for several months as other products did.We were unable to break it after 10 mos unlike competitors.BAD POINTS:Toddler kept flipping it back and forth and touching where we put the diapers.Did not keep room odor free after several mos of use.
3,OK,"I like it just enough, I guess. Sometimes diapers or wipes get stuck in the push-down mechanism, which I don't like. But overall it works as fine as any wastebasket with a cover should."
4,Clean Freak,"I first purchased a Diaper Genie and later read the reviews and immediately returned it. The Diaper Champ has been very easy to use and keeps the smell to a minimum. I honestly thought it would keep more of the dirty diaper smell away, but after 5 1/2 months of use it is indeed starting to smell. Not too bad if changed out every 4-6 days. I would still recommend it over the Diaper Genie."
2,Who cares about refills if it doesn't work properly?,"The concept is good. So far, at three and a half months, his s_ _ _ _ doesn't stink. The problem is, even though his diaper size is only ""1"", it clogs the chute. Even with the bag freshly changed, I have to open it up, and, from the inside, pull it through. No fun in the middle of the night. If the chute were widern diameter, it may be a hit."
5,GREAT diaper pail for the nursery!!,"The Diaper Champ lives up to it's name! It's great. No odor, and it accepts any kitchen garbage bag. When I received it at my baby shower and brought it home, my husband and I joked that it looked ""too simple"" to really work. Well, it does, and how!! Many of my friends have the more expensive competitor, and are very dissatified with it--you know the one!! This is MUST HAVE on any baby registry!!!"
1,Don't buy the Diaper Champ!!!,"I bought this product after reading a lot about it and reading the reviews. My daughter is turning 1 this month, I tried to make it work all this time, and finally had to give in and buy the Diaper Genie. I could no longer stand the smell in my baby's room, it was terrible!!! I like the fact that one could use 1 hand and also that it's larger than the other pails, but the smell was unbearable!!!! And, YES I did clean it at least once a week and always used Lysol when changing/emptying the bag. I have had the Diaper Genie only for a couple of weeks and the bad smell is gone from my baby's room!!!! =0)"
2,New design = smells escape into room and into your nose!,"We are long-time users of the Diaper Champ. We first got one in 2003, and when we did, we LOVED it. One-handed operation, plus NO SMELL. None. We bought a second one a few years later when the first one pooped out (pun intended!)Recently we needed a new one, and went to buy one here. We noticed the design had changed -- maybe it was somehow easier to use? Because there was no way they could improve on the smell. Like I said, NO SMELL.But the new one lets those acrid aromatics seep through, particularly when you operate it. The smell is DEFINITELY coming through. I'm very disappointed. For so many years, this operated beautifully, and now they are like every other diaper pail on the market. Only twice the price.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
4,It's GREAT!,"When our daughter was born she had a terrible digestive problem and had anywhere from 10-19 (YES, 19) poopy diapers a DAY! I was so thankful we had purchased the Diaper Champ. If we had gone with another product, the disposable bags alone would have broke us! We use every day garbage bags and to eliminate any odor when she has a really stinky diaper, we buy small scented diaper ""trash bags"". Believe me, we have had our share of poopy diapers (my daughter is 7 months old & now on solids) and her room has never smelled! I highly recommend this product. the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the lever to open the pail (when you're going to empty it) is sometimes hard to unlatch."
1,"Very Smelly, Hard to Open, Diapers Get Caught in Mechanism","I am really disappointed with this product. It really starts to smell after one day (and my baby is only 8 weeks old and is on breastmilk), which of course causes the baby's room to smell. By the end of the second day the room is pretty stinky. The way you open it is very poorly designed, making it difficult to open -- half the time I hurt a finger or break a nail. My third gripe is that small parts of the diaper will often get caught in the sealing mechanism, causing it to stick. so you then have to go in there and tear the diaper off and try to pull out the little stuck piece, which is very difficult to do and incredibly aggravating. This product STINKS! I am now trying to decide between a diaper genie and a diaper dekor or just using a regular diaper pail."
3,ok product,"I've had this item since day one. Over all it's a pretty good product, but yes it does smell, but my biggest gripe is that when I'm emptying the pail, I have to yank the stuck diapers out of the cylinder. This really is awful, especially since you have your face over a pile stinky diapers. It would be nice if I could just open the pail and grab the bag and close it up before I have to smell the contents.What I've started doing now is buying individual bags that i can enclose the dirty diaper in. This has really helped cut down on the odor and wrapped like this, I can put it anywhere and it doesn't stink. I think with my next baby I'll just use a regular trashcan and these individual diaper bags."
2,It Stinks!,"We had this product for a while. At first it was great, we thought it was better than the Diaper Genie, no need to buy extra bags. But after 3 months, it starts to smell. It stinks so bad! no matter how much we clean it, the smell stays around & it only gets worst. I wish we had kept our Diaper Genie. Now we are searching for another brand, if anyone of you know another product that don't need special bags & does not smell over time please share it!"
2,SMELLY,"This is a great item for the first few months-very easy to use, doesn't stink. But give it a few months and look out! The smell is terrible! I've tried baking soda, air fresheners (including the disinfecting ones), scented bags and have even gone so far as letting it soak in bleach for a day, but that didn't do squat. Hold your nose and get ready to run out of the room when you flip the handle, but with larger diapers you don't stand a chance of making it as they often get stuck. My son's room reeks since the smell seeps out 24/7. Off to buy a different one-too bad since my son enjoys depositing his diapers-until they get stuck and he gets frustrated! AVOID THIS ONE OR BE PREPARED TO SHELL OUT MORE $$ DOWN THE ROAD!!!"
3,Does the job,"Like another reviewer said, as baby gets older and starts eating solids, the Champ gets defeated. However, in the early days we had no real problem with the smell. It's still tolerable, but we just getting into solids.It's nice to be able to use regular trash bags in it, but my son went through a lot of diapers right from the start. So if you don't change the bags regularly it gets hard to turn the handle. The foam seal also came off of ours (as another reviewer said) and since then diapers sometimes get stuck.It is difficult to open. It took a few tries for both me and my husband to get. ""Child proof"", we joke.I do like having one place for all the dirties, so I the champ would still be welcome when baby number two arrives."
2,Stick with the Diaper Genie,"I am disappointed with the Diaper Champ. It worked great in the beginning, when my daughter's dirty diapers didn't smell that bad!!! But now she's 8 months old, eating solid food and her diapers smell pretty bad. The diaper Champ has let me down. It definitely does not control the odor. I read a couple of the reviews that say it does, but from what I read, most of those reviewers still had young babies. Once your baby gets older, it does NOT control the odor anymore. I have two other friends with older babies that have the Champ and both agree, the Diaper Champ STINKS, both literally and figuratively! I would stick with the Diaper Genie. I know it's a pain to buy the refills, but it's worth it to control the smell."
4,Seems Dog Proof,"Our diaper service provides a large diaper bucket with a flip open lid. We were concerned it wouldn't keep out our dogs who have less than appetizing ""food"" choices, so we bought a diaper champ. It's a great design and kind of fun to use. The only down side, and for us it meant temporary retirment of the diaper champ, is it only holds a couple days worth of cloth diapers for a newborn. (We were going through about 15 to 20 a day.) We had to go back to the larger bucket and lock the dogs out when we leave the house. Can't comment on the smells since our baby is only breastfed and there aren't any smells. We are in the process of doing ""infant potty training"" which is how baby wastes are dealt with in other countries. As we get good at that, our need for diapers will greatly diminish and we will be able to go back to the diaper champ. By the way, amazon sells two great books on Infant Potty Training."
2,Ours is smelly!,The Diamper Champ has not gone over well in our houselhold. Just after a few diaper changes my son's entire nursery reaks of dirty diaper. We've even resorted to tying the poopy diapers up in a grocery bag first and the room STILL smells. Guess we are moving on to something else.....
4,it does the job,"it sometimes smells if it has not been emptied in 2 or so days. it is tough to clean because if you fill it with bleach water and pour water into the top, the water doesn't come out easily."
3,Great for 4 months then it broke,"It is definatley the best diaper pail, especially since you can use regular trash bags. I didn't smell a thing untill the seal came off in the interior. Now it stinks to high haties. I am trying to see what the warranty is on it, I would buy it again since it saves money on refills but buy it at the store and save the box you can exchange it should you have the same problem."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"I had read all the reviews for this item, and was very excited to receive it as a shower gift. However, when I started to assemble the base, I realized that this doesn't seem to be all that it is cracked up to be. Firstly, to attach the base (which I didn't understand, why it isn't assembled for you), you must turn the unit upside down and screw it in. Not so difficult, but since the top isn't level, it is a bit difficult. Moving on, to actually opening the unit. I know this is very vain, but I found it very difficult to actually open the unit (I kept breaking a nail every time I opened it). Albeit, very vain, but why is it so difficult to open? Then, I was disappointed to find out that there is no scent or anything, so how does it really hide odors? My husband wondered what the difference there is between this and a regular trash can. I think we will return it for the Diaper Genie. All I have to say is that I'm glad I opened it before the baby comes."
2,I regret buying this diaper pail,"When I was pregnant with my son, I thought that I would be saving money by buying this. When my son was a infant, it worked okay. Around five months, when he started eating solid foods, it started to smell. I tried to bleach it, I tryed Lysol and I tryed all the scented trash bags. Nothing helped. The smell only got worse. It got to the point that the whole room would smell like a diaper pail. I could never get the smell out. I finally bought the diaper genie and I love it. I have two kids and I use it alot. I change the refill only once a month and it doesn't smell at all."
5,The Champ of Diaper Pails,"I agree with the other reviews. This pail is the one to get. We were given the Fisher Price Odor Free Diaper Pail and it was horrible. It still stinks even empty. We've been using the Diaper Champ for over a week now and I don't have any complaints. It holds more diapers, is easy to use and doesn't smell. What more can you ask for? It's bigger and kind of odd looking, but who cares?"
1,IT SMELLS!,"I believed everyone's great reviews for this item and put it on my registry. To my dismay, this product is NOT a champ. Yes, it may be economical because you use your own bags, but there's a flaw in the design. Everytime you want to empty out the pail, you open up the lid to an open bag filled with all your dirty and SMELLY diapers. Yes, the champ keeps the odor inside the pail but the bag mouth is open until you take it out of the pail (at which time the odors are all released) to tie it. I retured it and purchased the much contended Diaper Genie (...) to have a truly oderless room."
5,Absolutely Fantastic!,"We have had the original Diaper Champ for several years, on our back porch for our dogs' ""poop bags,"" and have been so pleased with it. We were so excited when they came out with the pink one for our baby girl's nursery. The pink one appears to have more capacity than the original, the handle has a pink textured grip, and the opening is definitely bigger, making it easier to fit full diapers into. We also use the Ruffies vanilla scented trash bags to cut down on odor (they also make lavender scented). Let's face it, diapers stink and nothing will ever completely eliminate the smell, but the Diaper Champ with scented trash bags does a pretty good job!"
1,Not a winner,"I bought diaper champ with our first and only child who is now 9 months old. At first I thought it was great--especially knowing I could use regular kitchen bags (vs. the diaper genie's special bags). I can't compare since this is my first child and I've not tried any other disposable system. However-- it really does not contain the smell, and the diapers ALWAYS get stuck when it becomes even somewhat full. My BIGGEST concern (and my primary reason for writing this review) is the platic from the kitchen garbage bag must fasten around the ""outside"" of the diaper champ. Now that my baby is crawling, he is drawn to the plastic. VERY SCARY when I first saw him crawl over and try pulling it to his mouth. In fact, I was surprised to find out this product is still on the market."
1,DIAPER CHAMP STINKS,"THIS THING WAS TERRIBLE. WE HAD THE HARDEST TIME WITH IT. I WOULD NOT BUY IT. THE DIAPERS GET STUCK IN THE TRUNER AND THEN YOU HAVE TO STICK YOUR HANDS IN THE MESS TO CLEAR IT SO IT WILL GO ON THROUGH. ALSO, THE DIAPERS SEEMED TO GET BLOCKED SO IT IS HARD TO TURN LIDS COVER. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK"
1,Stinky,Can't get the smell of rank diapers out of the top(cover) of the Diaper Champ. Any better models out there?
2,"works, then doesnt?","we had this thing for 6 months - during the winter it was fine. however, once we started using the ac, the house started to stink. it is not near the cold air return, but it somehow sucks the stink and blows it around the house. even with changing the bag every day, sprays, washing it, still there. dont understand it, but it stinks. i even changed the furnace filter and sprayed febreeze on it, still stinks."
1,Diaper Champ Sucks!,"Got it on the advice of my sister in law, who is a ditz. This thing gets stuck when you put a wet wipe in it, gets poop down the inside of it and the piston just drags the poop through it if the diaper is not perfectly sealed up. It stinks, literally. After only a month of use as the babies diapers got more smelly, so did her room. It poorly contains the odor. Shoulda just got a diaper genie, like my own sister had. I hate to buy the refill's but its better than having a stinky room when people come to visit. I have to clean the inside of it all the time. THis thing sucks."
2,You really don't need it,"We had this with our first baby and it worked fine, but was very smelly after a while. I think we used it about 18 months and then it became unbearable.You really don't need a diaper pail unless you are going to use cloth diapers. Just use the kitchen trash. You think that might smell, but since most people empty their kitchen trash frequently, there are not as many dirty diapers in there. Put solid poop in the toilet, otherwise you can just toss the diapers. Our daughter is 11 months old, eating solid food, and we've never had a problem. We do have a cheap pail for the cloth diapers, but we clean it thoroughly when we launder the diapers."
3,"Convenient, but smelly!","I also opted for the Diaper Champ because there isn't any refills. It is very easy to use, but is difficult to open. I'm afraid of ripping a fingernail completely off everytime I change the bag. My problem is with odor control. There isn't any. My newborn daughter's room smells constantly. It only takes ONE poopy diaper to smell. Yes we do change the bag regularly per other posts. We had to keep a fan on in her room during the summer just to keep the odor from a choking level. No exaggeration! If the smell wasn't a problem, I'd completely recommend this product."
2,Not as great as described,"I was definately excited to have a diaper pail capable of keeping smells down and holding more diapers. I have two little ones under the age of two. I was immediately disapointed to find that everytime I tried to filp the diaper into the pail, in the entire thing opened up. I guess mine could be broken but I think its just poor design. It also seems to be no better than the competitors at keeping diaper smells in the pail. The plus is that it uses regular trash bags."
4,Very convenient,"I have been very happy with this pail. The greatest thing... regular trash bags!! The Next greatest thing... 1 handed operation & it takes only a SECOND! Awesome!I have not had any issues with odor. I change the bag every 5-6 days or so. If the plunger is not going down, it's because you need to change the bag!!The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because changing the bag takes a few minutes. It can be difficult to open, ALthough, when my daughter gets older and starts getting into things, this will probably be a blessing! :)"
3,Stinky!,"The Diaper Champ is very easy to use. Changing the bags is as easy as can be, and you operate it easily with one hand (keeping the other on the baby). I appreciate that I don't have to buy special bags for it. However, it does not control the oder. I wonder how many of the reviewers that say it does have children over 1 year old. If you think your 3 month old's diaper stink, you ain't smelled nothing yet."
4,Love It,"I got this for my daughter and I just think it's great. We have this in her room and I haven't smelled any ordors coming from it except for when you open it up to take out the bag. I also love the fact that you can use just regular bags. I know of someone that had a diaper genie and she still had a diaper in it from when her baby was born and she was about 2 months at that time. I've found that when it starts getting alittle full just shake it to level the diapers out and you will be able to get more in there. I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
5,Can't smell a thing!,"I was nervous, being a first time mom, about the dirty diaper smell. I was afraid I would drive everyone out of the house. When company would come over I was terrified that when they went upstairs to see my daughter...all they would smell was dirty diapers! Well after I got the Diaper Champ my worries are gone. The only time I smell anything is when I open the cover to empty the bag. Thanks Baby Trend for this awesome product!!"
5,Works great!,"It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work. At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all! It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty. I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal. The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room."
5,hassle-free and odorless,One of the better items we received as a registry gift! One-handed operation and we can use the same garbage bags we use for the kitchen. Appreciated as there is no place in our town that sells the competition's refills.
3,Don't order this from BabyHaven,"We order this, the original diaper champ, because we were told by almost everyone that the original is great but the new, ""deluxe"" is awful. So, we put this, the original, on our registry. The company that fulfilled the order is called Babyhaven. They sent us the deluxe, which is not what we ordered. We sent them a screenshot proving to them that what we ordered on our registry was the original, so they agreed to refund the person who purchased it for us the money, but said that we have to pay shipping. That seemed ridiculous, since it is their fault for advertising that they're selling the original but sending out the crappy deluxe. We eventually worked it out with Amazon, getting some Amazon credits in exchange for having to pay shipping to BabyHaven, but only after some phone calls and big hassle. So: BEWARE OF ORDERING THIS ITEM FROM THIRD PARTIES, THEY MAY TRY TO SEND YOU THE FAR INFERIOR DELUXE VERSION."
5,"Easy, cost-effective, no odor!","I received my first diaper champ as a hand-me-down and I absolutely love it! There's no odor from the pail and it is far easier to use than the genie. I don't know if there's very little odor because my son is breastfed, but even with the addition of solids, there's no stinky smell in the house. We only have to change the pail when it's full. I've placed an AirWick stick-up in the pail for good measure. Also, there are no special refills to buy, you can use regular trash bags. You can spend as much on 2 months (or less!) of genie refills as you would to purchase the Champ. All in all, an excellent buy!"
1,More like The Diaper CHUMP,"Don't waste your time and money. This thing is large, clunky, and worst of all doesn't do anything to contain the smell. My daughter is 9 days old, primarily feeding on breast milk, and our entire second floor smells like dirty diapers. We're going to try the Diaper Genie next, refill costs notwithstanding."
5,Great!,"I bought this for the pre-school I teach at and it works wonders! No more poo smell! And when you have 14 kids who are all about 2 years old and are there 8 hours a day, its a life saver. The only bad things about it are easily correctable (If I can do it with 14 kids, most poeple can do it with 1). First of all, it only takes diapers and wipes. Nothing else or it gets stuck. If it does get stuck, it is easy to fix. Just open the lid and pull the stuck part out. Second, toddlers like to play with it and you have to be careful of little fingers getting caught. Simply tell them that it is NOT A TOY and is for teachers (or parents) only."
2,too smelly,"Thought this was the best diaper pail for the first 6 months... holds lots of diapers, no smell, etc... but once the baby started eating solids... poops were smellier...and the diaper champ didn't work... the whole room would smell despite emptying the bag 2-3xs per week... Also, my one year old thinks it's a toy to play with because of the flip handle it has... The Champ is now sitting in the garage because I got tired of the smell. There's got to be something better. I may have to give in and buy the Diaper Genie."
1,Diaper CHUMP!,"We got the Diaper Champ because we thought it was smart to use regular garbage bags and not pay for the diaper Genie refills. BIG MISTAKE! This product does not keep odor in, and when you open it up to put in a new bag in, its all over. My daughter's room stinks because of this product and we are in the process of trying to find a REAL odorless diaper pail."
2,Prefer the Genie,"I am due to have my 2nd baby in a couple of weeks. With my first child, I went with the Diaper Genie and decided that I would give the Champ a try this time. I had read all the kudo's all the new mommies gave the champ on odor etc. Well, I have been using it for a couple of weeks now with my toddler's diapers and you better believe that the pail stinks when you move the handle to dump a diaper. I am sure it works well for infants who do not have the STINKY toddler diapers. Another complaint....the thing is SO easy to use that my toddler loves to put things (other than diapers - pacies, toys etc) into it and flip the handle. Overall, it's ok...but I still think the Genie is the better of the two for the long haul."
2,Room smells like dirty diapers,"I can't imagine that I am using this product incorrectly, but just last night I walked down the hall and really noticed the nursery smells like a dirty diaper. I had noticed it before, but never really thought that the Diaper Champ was claimed to be ""odor-free."" Sorry, but I don't buy it. Maybe little baby diapers and areas associated with them will just inherently smell like pooh, but if it claims to contain odors, it falls short. I don't know if we will bother to try another model/brand, but for the time being, I am buying a scent-masking spray/device to help tone the scent down. I love the little guy, but wow he can put out a scent."
5,The Champ is a real Winner,"I don't know how we survived the first year without the Diaper Champ. My daughter is now 13 1/2 months old and we still have an odor free nursery. It's very economical, too. Using regular kitchen bags and holding more diapers than the competing diaper disposal system makes this quite efficient.A trick that was passed down to me from an experienced mom to control odor (again, yes, it's going to smell a little...you put stinky diapers in it!): Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use. I don't know why the dryer sheet works...but it does! And if I don't change it out regularly (about once every few weeks) then I start to notice the smell.Recommended above all other diaper pails! Price-wise the Diaper Champ just can't be beat."
4,Truely a Champ,"When looking for a diaper pail my husband and I wanted something easy to use, no expensive refill packs, and of course something that would hold in odor. We found all that in the Diaper Champ! We've been using ours for almost 8 mths now and love it. Yes if you leave the pail open for long periods of time there might be an odor but this is easily fixable by placing an odor disc, like you put in vacum bags, in the current trashbag. You can get the discs most places you buy vaccum bags. This is a great prduct and I recommend it to all my mommy friends."
5,This one doesn't take *special* bags,"We registered for the Diaper Champ when a friend of mine suggested it over the one she owned - the Diaper Genie. She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well. Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ. It is mindless to operate. It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode. It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon). And it is very easy to clean. I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple. I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning. I'd abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in. I am very pleased with our choice."
3,Aidan's Mom,"We got this diaper pail as a shower gift before my son was born. He's now 13 months old so we have really given it a run for it's money.Pros:- I love that you can use regular kitchen sized trash bags.- It's easy to use - just drop the diaper in and flip the handle.- It can hold a lot of diapers(although the more diapers you pack in there, the worse the smell).Cons:- The smell!! It didn't smell at all the first six months but once we started my son on baby food the smell was horrific! I understand that you have to change the bag often but this thing doesn't even contain the smell after one day of dirty diapers!But I guess I still like it more than the Diaper Genie.Bottom line - all diaper pails smell - so do you want one that's easy to use and can use regular bags or do you want one that require expensive refills and isn't as user friendly?"
5,No smells here!,"This is a great diaper pail. It seals really well so the smell is contained. Unlike other diaper pails, this one doesn't require special bags so there is no additional expense. It is also easy to use one-handed, which is important when you have a squirming baby on the changing table."
1,"It stinks, literally","A very good friend of mine gave me one of these for a shower gift. We both thought it was a neat idea...no pricey refills to purchase. Unfortunately, after a couple of days, the diaper champ reeked to high heaven! I sprayed it with lysol, put an air freshener in it, cleaned it with bleach, emptied it daily and it still stunk!! I followed all instructions for operating it to no avail. We finally ended up throwing it out! My friends that had the diaper genie didn't experience the air pollution that we did with this. So if you need a system, I suggest the diaper genie. Right now, we are using the little bags our newspapers come in to dispose of diapers and we don't have any smell."
2,Disappointed with Diaper Champ,"I used the genie for two years and pregnant with my second child, I read the reviews of the champ and was excited. After two years, the plastic of the genie soaked in the smells. With the champ, I was very disappointed because after two days, I need to change the champ or it will smell up the house. I could leave diapers in the genie for up to 7 days before changing it out. I only use the genie/champ for poopy diapers. Maybe mine is defective...I'll never know. I am going to sell my champ on e-bay and buy another genie. The fillers with the genie are a pain, but worth it."
2,Good for up to a year only.,"We bought this since my sister was using it for her new daughter and having no problems with it. Well up to a year it was fine, but now the whole room stinks so horribly we can't leave it in the room. A couple times now I've cleaned it, sprayed it with clorox disinf. spray, and after putting a few diapers in it again the stink in his room is intolerable. We don't feed him anything out of the ordinary either. If you don't mind the possibility of having to go buy another pail after some time then this is all no biggie, but if you can't easily afford that- then don't do it."
2,Stinky!,"I am very disappointed with this diaper pail, I don't find that it contains the smell at all. It is especially bad when you flip the top to put a new diaper in. I actually took it out of my daughters room because I didn't want her to sleep in a poopy smelling room. I would not buy this product again and I would definitly not recommend it to anyone else."
1,Are you kidding me??,"All I have to say is OH NO, keep away!! I had originally bought the diaper champ since it seemed to be it the more economical choice since I could use any bags I wanted with it. I have had the thing for two years now, I use good quality kitchen bags, I air it out, spray it with Lysol and am very careful to correctly install the bags...HOWEVER... this thing STINKS!!!!!! When it is closed, the odor is bearable (but still detectable), but when you go to remove the bag...OH GOD HELP YOU!!! I cannot tell you how awful the smell is, especially once they start eating solid foods! The worst part is I had recommended the thing to all my friends because I really believed it was the better option and now we all hate it and won't use it anymore! It's bad."
2,Nothing oderless about this!,"While the design of this diaper champ is, indeed, streamlined (it is easy to use and doesn't need expensive special bags) it fails completely in the main purpose: to contain odor! The champ is not airtight, has no fan, no filters - so of course the smell of dirty diapers quickly permeates the room! I was changing the bag everyday and still could not contain the smells. I would NOT recommend this to anyone - better off to just use a plain bag and save your money!"
1,Very poor design - after about 4 weeks of use,"Not only is this poorly designed, so far... no response from the company. I really took the advice of friends when I bought this, but I didn't consider asking more than two - one I didn't know (word of mouth) and the other only had hers a month when she recommeded it. She doesn't like it now either. The problem is in the blue ring around the top. It comes loose after a bit, especially if someone uses it and say ""forces"" it to turn when it won't or just sheer misdesign (not sure which), and then doesn't work very smoothly. In fact it's annoying to be wrapping a diaper (which is annoying in itself) with a newborn crying and then turn to use some perceived wonderful item to find it getting stuck and not working at all. I'm going to try the diaper genie NOW."
4,"Great, sturdy pail","I originally had another pail and it broke after about 9 months of use, so I got this one. I love it! It is very easy to use and keeps the diapers away from little hands. It has a large capacity and cuts back on frequent trips to the trash can. I keep a stick on air freshner in the bottom and it helps with lingering smells. Also no expensive refills to buy! Great pail."
2,"Okay, but a garbage pail with tight lid would be just as easy","I bought this primarily because it takes regular trash bags, we used it the way it's supposed to be used for the first couple of days but quickly discovered that as the pail gets full the dropping mechanism gets stuck forcing you to clean out the mechanism whenever it's time to change the pail, and it's one more thing to wipe down if a diaper gets too messy. Also, my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper. Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in, this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed... and still trap the smell! Of course this negates the cool mechanism and makes it a plastic trash can with a tight lid, something I could have bought for cheaper."
4,does a good job,"Great investment. Easy to use! It doesn't hold as many diapers as our last diaper pail, but it doesn't smell anywhere as bad. I am planning on using it as a bathroom garbage after my son is out of diapers. Both of my sister-in-laws own this and they both recommended it to me. It uses regular 13 gallon garbage bags which is very convenient. It's well worth the money!"
4,Pretty good product,"I bought this one over the Diaper Genie because of the bag thing...probably like everyone else did. My only complaint so far is that if you don't fold the diapers properly so the sticky tabs are folded in, it gets stuck for the next time you try to turn it. Then you have to open it up and unclog the thing. EEewwww...It's not the best design in the world, but I do LOVE that you can use any kind of bag in there. Would probably keep this for other kids or even buy it again."
3,Seems like I'm the only one who's not pleased.,"At first I really liked this product. My son is now three months old and the thing is falling apart. In the center tube where the diapers go through, there is some foam lining in the cracks - mine is all coming out.Also, when you change the bag - it is nasty. Sometimes the diapers will get stuck in the tube and you have to manually pull them out. Since there is no twisting of the bag (like the diaper genie) when you open this thing it smells realllly bad.Also...opening it is difficult. I always bend all of my nails back when pulling out on the lever.It's true that it holds the smell though. That's why I gave it three stars.I guess I'm just disappointed because mine is already in need of a replacement and my baby is only 3 months old. I'm going to see if the manufacturer will give me a refund and then I'm getting the diaper genie."
4,Great Diaper Pail,"We love this diaper pail. It is so easy to use and looks nice in my sons room. We bought this diaper pail because we didn't want to hassel with special bags. However, as my son began to ate solid foods his diapers began to change. The odor initally was a problem, but we have since solved it. I now use the odor free trash bags and haven't had a problem since. I too wipe it and spray with Lysol because it is a storage unit for dirty diapers. We would recommend this, but with the use of odor free trash bags. They don't cost more than regular bags and since you still need to use a bag, there really is no hassel."
4,Does't get much better than this!,"I often wonder about people who expect an ""odor-free"" disposal system for diapers. I can't just ""toss them in the trash"" as one reviewer suggests...my dog and/or my crawling baby will get into it! If you ARE looking for some kind of closed container, with odor CONTAINING features, it doesn't get much better than the diaper champ!"
2,the room still stinks like poopies,"yeah yeah, you don't have to buy refills, but the reason i bought a diaper pail (instead of just using a garbage can) was to reduce the poopie smell in the room. no dice with this thing even when i washed it out and sprayed it with lysol once a week. the stink gets into the plastic and won't come out. it's now in my basement. i bought a dekor and will hopefully have better luck."
2,50/50 Satisfaction,"This is great for ease of use -- it uses any bag, is good-size (little on the large side), and holds quite a bit before it has to be emptied. However, it doesn't hold as many odors. For the first two weeks I had this it was great. I considered a second. Now you can smell the odors, faintly but enough to know what they are and where they are coming from. (yuck!) I'm going with the Diaper Dekkor for my second diaper pail."
5,Wonderful!!!!,"I have been using this diaper pail now for 6 months. My daughter is now eating foods, and we still have no problems. I use scented kitchen trash bags in the pail and haven't smelled anything. I guess the test will be the summer heat, but I am sure I will have no problems...... I would highly suggest this product to any mom."
1,Ignore bad reviews if you want a STINKY room:,"At first we were pleased with the Diaper Champ because of its easy-to-use function and the fact that we did not have to buy special refills or bags. However, we quickly learned that the biggest drawback to the Champ is its inability to seal in odor. We frequently empty the bags and clean the pail (including Lysol, chlorine bleach, and anti-bacterial wipes) but have found the odor to be overwhelming and ever present regardless of disinfectant or frequent bag changes. Recently in a popular parenting magazine, they reviewed various diaper disposal systems and used Limburger cheese (a very potent and stinky cheese) to measure odor levels among the various systems. Diaper Champ received the worst rating for odor (4 cheese wedges indicating the worst odor rating possible.) I would avoid the hassle, spend a few extra bucks and get one of the other, higher-rated and popular systems."
2,I prefer my Diaper Genie!,"We bought this for baby #2 thinking that it would be easier and have a larger capacity. I had some trouble getting the garbage bags to be really secure in there, and furthermore ended up having to push the weight down in order to get the diaper to fall all the way through before it was really full, maybe when it was about 2/3 full. Lastly, for the really dirty, messed up diapers, I would have to clean the chute, whereas that is not a consideration for the Diaper Genie."
4,Plunger cylinder gets stuck sometimes,"My son is now 5 mo. and overall, I'm happy with the diaper champ. I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags. Do not kid yourself that you will have an odor-free diaper pail--I do not think that is possible! I would rate this as low-odor--I change the bag about once a week. My complaint, though, is that the plunger-cylinder thing gets stuck because the diapers begin to stack on top of one-another even when the bag is newly-changed. Also, I do not use the plunger for messy diapers because if the tabs are nor fastened, the tabs get stuck in the plunger thing. I do not wrap up the messy ones because of the leak factor, so I wind up having to open the lid frequently. The lid is a bit difficult to open, but I like that because when my little guy is more mobile he won't be able to open it!"
3,Just OK,"The Diaper Champ did not come with instructions on how to install the garbage bag. I believe I initially installed it incorrectly, which is why we had such a stinky poopy-smelling room for a while (as did my best friend who had made the same mistake with hers too). Then we figured out that garbage bag needs to be threaded through the blue center hole and pulled through. That corrected the stinkiness for the most part. However, occasionally, stinky poopy smells its way through. I have put baking soda and sprayed Lysol in the can to help with smell. Bottom line - the ad that it is ""odorless"" is not 100% true. But for the most part, the Diaper Champ is adequate."
3,The real deal on the Diaper Champ!,"The first 6 months I had the diaper champ I thought it was fabulous! A breeze to use, the older kids can flip the lid, only uses regular trash bags. I had no issues with it at all. Well, as you more experienced parents know, the REAL test is the more ""big kid"" diapers that are a result of a child eating all kinds of table foods!Without being too gross, I have to say that the odor is absolutely unbearable. Its just as bad as all the rest including the Diaper Genie, the Fisher Price diaper pail and for the awful stench in the baby's room, I might as well be throwing the dirty diapers in a regular old trash can.This works fine for most diapers. Take your toxic ones to an outside trash bin."
4,The Diaper Champ Certainly Is,"I have been using the Diaper Champ for the past three months. It holds lots of diapers and you can stuff it full. I have not smelled any bad odor coming from the pail in my son's room. It is easy to change a new bag, but I would suggest doing it outside. Once you open it up the smell does escape quickly. But, just give a quick wipe with a disenfectant cloth and put in your own garbage bag and you are ready to put it back in the room. I am very happy to have this diaper pail. I recommend it."
4,EASY TO USE!,"This diaper pail is easy to use, with the greatest benefit being NO SPECIAL BAGS. This saves money!!! I have not noticed any odor problems as others mentioned, but would say that the latch to open it is a bit tough. Since this is only necessary when changing bags, I do not mind this minor flaw. It is also easy to clean and it slender shape hides nicely behind a door or in the corner."
1,Difficult to clean,I can see why this product gets great reviews. Everybody writes their review before they have had to clean it. My evaluation of the product changed 180 degrees after trying to clean this thing. When some poop inevitably squeezes out of a diaper that you are trying to dispose of you have a mess to clean up. I just spent a poopy hour trying to clean this thing. It is difficult to disassemble -- you need a screwdriver! -- and there are a lot of crevices in the cylinder that get poop in them and are impossible to clean. There is a foam cushion glued to the plastic under the flip assembly and if that gets poopy it smears the poop all over the lid every time you flip it! How are you supposed to clean the poop out of the foam? The screws go directly into soft plastic so after a few disassemblies they aren't going to hold anymore. Next time I'd look into something else.
5,This is a MUST HAVE for baby's room!,"This diaper pail is one of he best gifts we received! It's so easy to use and there are no additonal costs for refill bags because you can use just about any size bag you have! It's also really easy to use, all you need is one hand to drop and dispose of the diaper. It keeps baby's room odor free too! It's the best diaper disposal out there! As a first time parent I highly recommend this!"
2,Did NOT live up to my expectations!,"I purchased this diaper disposal system with gift cards I received at my baby shower and was so excited at the idea of an alternative to the ""special bags"" disposal systems. Not long after I started using the champ the blue name disks on the sides started just falling out for no reason. I have more than one child and seeing a toddler running through the house with a piece to the diaper pail in their mouth is enough to turn your stomach. Besides the unsanitary aspect of that, it is a safety issue. My husband and I both have tried to get it to stay in permanently to no avail. I also am not too thrilled with the fact that anything besides diapers will get caught in the flip mechanism and be stuck there. I really wish I had just stuck with the Diaper Genie and will probably go out and purchase it anyway. I am NOT a happy customer!"
2,"Great for disposables, useless for cloth diapers","Doesn't require special bags, which is a plus. This worked pretty well for the first year of our daughter's life, while we were using disposables, although it doesn't contain the smell as much as we'd like.But once we switched to cloth, FORGET IT! This diaper pail was out of the nursery in a flash. It was constantly jamming, requiring us to open the whole thing up and pull dirty wipes and diapers out of the drum mechanism. Yuck.We're better served by a flip-top trash can, frankly. Considering that we bought this pail specifically because it said it would work for cloth diapers, too, I'm pretty disappointed."
1,Baby Enthusiast,"I have the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie from Playtex. The Diaper Champ has horrible odor control. I would rate the Diaper Genie much higher. The Diaper Champ doesn't hold the odor, it smells up the whole room. I can actually smell the diapers down the hallway. It's much more convenient than the other models, but I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone. I'm really disappointed in the Diaper Champ."
1,It Stinks!,I originally received the Diaper Genie as a gift but exchanged it for the Diaper Champ because I didn't want to spend the money on refills every month. BAD IDEA! While it was convenient to use my own trash bags in the Diaper Champ they NEVER contained the terrible smell. I used the Diaper Champ for almost 6 weeks before I finally threw it out and went back to re-buy the Diaper Genie. DO NOT spend your money on the Diaper Champ - it stinks!
2,not all that great,"We have used this for 8 months. Even with lysol, etc, there is still an odor. PLus, the one handed operation is not really possible...9 times out of 10 the handle jams as you try to flip it. We have also had diapers get trapped during the flip, even when folded compactly...this results in poop smears inside the flipping drum, where it is very hard to clean. I loved being able to use my own garbage bags as refills, but the sheer bulk and ugliness of this unit, coupled with odor and the jamming flip device, led me to buy a diaper dekor instead to replace it. Diaper dekor is MUCH better...even considerng the high cost of refills."
3,Not as good as I had Hoped,"After reading all the reviews on-line for this product I chose to register for it, now that I am using it I am disappointed. I'm not sure if my sense of smell is just that of super hero's or my daughter has super smelly diapers. Either way her room does have the smell of dirty diapers when you enter and the ""Champ"" is in the back corner of the room. I guess I'm just grateful that the whole house doesn't smell as bad as her room."
1,put out in garage,"We had diaper genie with our first it lasted alot longer than this one did before it starts smelling. Our child is four months old and it smells up the whole room, after a couple of days after being emptied. We moved it to the garage."
1,This product Stinks - literally!,Do not listen to the other reviews on this webpage - this product makes the entire nursery smell! I originally bought this rather than the Diaper Genie because I did not want to have to buy special bags but what a mistake! If you do not use deoderized bags you will need to change the bag every single day because if there is one poopy diaper in there it smells really bad. I actually threw out the Diaper Champ that I had bought and got the Diaper Genie instead which is 100X better!
4,Easy to Use Pail Without Proprietary Bags!,I own 2 diaper pails (one for upstairs and one for downstairs). My other pail is the Diaper Dekor which is my favorite of the two. This pail is a close second to the Dekor. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because my diapers sometimes get stuck and it seems to smell a bit more than the Dekor. To operate this pail you put the dirty diaper in the hole at the top. You then pull the handle which turns the top over and dumps the diaper in the pail. There is a weight in the top that helps push the diaper into the pail. Occasionally the diaper will get stuck in the pail. When this happens I have to open the pail and push the diaper through with my hand. This doesn't happen too frequently so I'd still buy this pail again.The pros are that it is less expensive than the Dekor and it does not use proprietary bags so it saves you money in the long-run.
2,NOT FOR CLOTH,"We are using fitted cloth diapers and now that my daughter is 6 months old and we are using a larger size diaper, the snaps are always getting caught on the way into the pail. Very frustrating and messy. The pail also doesn't hold very many diapers and I find my self washing diapers more often that I would normally have to. Contrary to other postings, I have not had any problems with odor. I will eventually have to get a new pail, but I hate the thought of dumping a huge hunk of hardly used plastic in a landfill."
3,Not for Twins!,"This is much better than the Genie, it doesn't smell as bad if you take your trash out on a regular basis. The only way I can keep it from smelling is to put a cloth wet with pine-sol in the bottom. This generally works for 3 or 4 days. However, the capacity is not that great especially if you have twins! (But what is except for a 33 gallon trash can with a hole in the top!) The capacity is really the only thing I can complain about, even with one baby it seemed to fill up pretty fast. It is convient, no twisting, turning, or shoving the diapers like you have to with the Genie. And the use of any bag is great, too! Although, it seems to tear everytime I change it. Overall, for the price and for one baby, it's not too bad."
5,A True Champ!,"We've been using the Diaper Champ for the past 8 months and love it! It's easy to use and keeps the smell it. We change the bag 1-2 times a week even though our son has at least 1 stinky, dirty diaper per day. Ocassionally I take it outside and spray it with Clorox disinfecting spray and let it air out. Try it...you'll like it!"
3,Great for newborns,"I highly recommend this for newborns because you can use your own garbage bags and it works very well. However, starting around 11 months the smell has gotten increasingly worse. We change the bag at least 3 times a week and spray it with Lysol but even one stinky diaper smells up the whole room. We are going to buy something else now."
3,"Nice concept, but doesn't hold the odor!","I had received both the Diaper champ and a Diaper Genie for my baby shower, unsure how the diaper champ would work, I hung on to both of them. Thank god I did. The concept of the Diaper Champ works great, very easy to use, although in the first two day that I brought my newborn home, the odor was so bad that little fruit flies were flying around in the room. Also when you open it up to empty it the bag isn't sealed so the odor escapes then. I have put my Diaper Champ aside and have opened my Diaper Genie, which has worked extremely well. I would rather by the refills that deal with the odor."
3,Not good for formula fed babies....,"I have had this product for 3 1/2 months now and I was happy to get it so that I wouldn't have to buy refills like the Diaper Genie requires. Well, my daughter ended up starting on formula and the Diaper Champ did not contain her poopie diaper smells very well. We even sprayed it with the antibacterial Lysol spray and it didn't change anything. My friends with breast fed babies (whose poopie diapers don't stink as much) said that it works fine for them. My husband said that he noticed that the seal was starting to tear on it a little. So I have recently purchased a Diaper Genie ...to use for her poopie diapers alone since the Diaper Champ works fine with the other diapers."
2,Only good UNTIL.....,"I registered for this item because I heard good things, well it is good UNTIL your baby starts eating baby food and has more bowel movements. This pail lasted me until my baby was 5 months old, then the pail does not hold in odor. I have spoken to several of other mothers who have the same problem. So use your judgement but be prepared to have odors once the baby starts eating baby food."
2,Great product for the first couple of months,"This product at first worked out great, but after a few months of use. It does not trap the smelly diaper odor. I personally would not recommend this product."
1,Very disappointed!,"It smells, smells, SMELLS!!! Don't waste your money. I was attracted to this pail because you can use any platic garbage bags. It spends most of its time on my back deck airing out! I tried washing it once this winter in the bathtub and got water in the top....it was all messed up after that. I am currently looking for a new pail."
3,Works for a while,"First of all, I don't think any diaper pail is going to be fool proof. We have used ours for 17 months now and it does emit an odor if we haven't changed it in one or two days. It started this when my son was about 13 months and eating mostly solids. I tried cleaning it out with all types of products, but it still smells. I will probaby replace it, but honestly, I think this is still the best diaper pail that uses household trash sacks, so I will buy another diaper champ. But don't expect one to last through potty training."
4,GREAT Diaper Pail,This is a wonderful pail -- we had the Odorless Pail for 2 years and it is NOT odorless and it's gross that you have to push diaper in with your hands to get it to go all the way in. This is a marvelous invention and I love that you can use regular trash bags. I highly recommend this pail!
5,Cloth Diapering Necessity!,"We cloth diaper our son, and the diaper champ is great for those, too! Unlike <other diaper pail... :) > with the sausage chain, the Champ holds cloth diapers (and their smell!) in nicely, and with easy retrieval. I recommend it to anyone who CDs!"
4,So easy to use and uses regular bags!,"We love the Diaper Champ. It's really easy to use with one hand and we can't smell a thing, which is even more impressive when you consider we have 6 week old twins. We highly recommend the Diaper Champ. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars is that after a while, the plunger gets sticky and will not drop all the way to the bottom. We washed it according to the directions, and it took a few days (had to really dry out) for it to work fine again."
4,55 weeks and still happy...,"I waited to review this until I saw how it performed in the really-stinky-diaper stage. Now, with my daughter at 1 year and eating lots of solids (and making really stinky diapers), I can happily recommend the diaper champ. A couple suggestions: 1) as baby's poop gets stinkier, empty more often (at least once a week) and 2) every time you empty, spray with Lysol or similar product and wipe out with antibacterial cleaner. This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it's not ""perfect"" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it's very full. But all around a good product, and not needing special refill bags is a huge benefit for a busy mom."
5,Expect too much??,"I think some people out there are expecting too much from a product that is designed to hold human waste. It smells. Short of casting a magic spell on it that's how life is. I love this product because it keeps the smell from becoming a serious issue in the baby's room. As long as you change the bags when they're full and clean the pail like it tells you to, I haven't found there to be a big problem. Lysol also really helps. It helps in between cleanings. I just am grateful that they've come out with stuff like this and other diaper pails since I was born. I bought this pail because I didn't want to have to pay for expensive liners. I buy the scented kind from walmart. One less thing to worry about."
2,Stinky Product!,"I thought I had researched all the diaper pails that were out there. I previously owned a Diaper Genie, and hated the thought of having buy the refills. So I invested in the Diaper Champ and that thing stinks so much!!! The Diaper Genie only smelled when I was changing the refill, but the CHAMP stinks my boys room up.. I have tried everything from a stick-um to deodorized bags and nothings helps the smell from getting out.. I have a 2 yr old and a 4 month old and that room gets really Smelly... I don't recommend this Diaper Champ!!"
4,Works great for me!,"I like the Diaper Champ. My little boy's room doesn't stink from dirty diapers. I empty it once a week, when it is time for trash pick-up. I like the fact of using regular trash bags instead of having to buy special bags. I do wipe it down a couple of times a month. I have also put in a box of baking soda to help absorb the odors inside. I highly recommend this product. It is very easy to drop in your dirty diapers."
3,Nice now but....,"I've been over to friends' houses and fought with their diaper genies. I decided to go with the Diaper Champ instead, because you can use regular trash bags with it (much less expensive than the Genie refills).I had no complaints, until it got really warm in my daughter's room and then the smell appeared. I've tried Lysol and the dryer sheet at the bottom of the can and various other tricks to mask the odor emanating from the Champ without luck. Baby is breast-fed too. I can only imagine how bad the smell will be, once we start her on solids. Ick.I'm wondering if fighting with the Genie and buying refills is a better option for us, as we don't have air-conditioning and it will get warm in the room this summer!I will say this though, other reviewers have complained that the bag is not completely full when the Champ seems to need a change, but I find this convenient, as I don't have to drag out an extremely heavy bag."
2,Not user friendly,"We got this and the Diaper Decor Plus as gifts and I have to say that the Champ is not my favorite. I like that you can use your own garbage bags with the Champ, but that's the only positive in my opinion. I find it pretty hard to open it without breaking a nail and it does get fill up much more quickly than the Decor. When you're changing the bags on the champ, it can be messy, depending on how long you waited to change the bag, but with the Decor, you just open the front door and knot the bag even if it's full to the brim--so much easier. I also like the Decor because you can dispose of the diaper with your foot, instead of a hand like with the Champ, because now that my son is super squirmy on the changing table, I need of my hands on him!"
4,Good Product,"We have ours in our living room and you can't smell a thing. It is a little difficult to open and it doesn't hold a lot of diapers, but overall it works well."
1,The Stink is out of Control,This was a very poor purchase I was sucked in with the no refills to buy but the smell is horrible I have to empty it almost everyday and even after that it sits out on my porch half the time to get the smell out and even then it still stinks. If I had to do over again I would buy another Diaper Genie.
1,HORRIBLE,I hate this diaper pail. I bought it because of the reviews I read. It worked for six months when he was breastfed only. But when he started solids it all changed. It smelled so bad in his room. The diaper pail must not have a very good seal. Do not buy this diaper pail.
3,It's okay- but really there are less expensive ways....,Simply save the plastic bags from grocery shopping and be sure to empty your garbage everyday. WAHLAH!I have the diaper champ-but really it fits like three diapers then I have to change the bag. I've just resorted to the grocery bag method.
1,Awful!,"Diaper catches and jams in the well and that is particularly nasty when the diaper is dirty. Also, it is impossible to get it 100% clean after such a jam, which causes the oder to persist. I have given up and am now throwing my Diaper Champ away and getting something new."
1,Piece of junk!,"I would strongly NOT recommend this product! I was on a very tight baby budget and thought this would be great because there were no refills to purchase. It did a HORRIBLE job of keeping the odor in and when I went to change the bag, there were MAGGOTS in it. I was so grossed out and disgusted!! When I wrote to the company to complain, my letter was sent back to me because the seedy little company had closed up shop and moved with no forwarding address!!On top of everything else, the piston kept getting stuck, so you had to push it down by hand.I ended up buying a diaper genie, which I should have done from the start. Don't let the lure of no refills trick you. To me, it is far better to have to purchase refills than to live with stench and BUGS!"
4,No Smell here,"This diaper champ is a great product. I have seen reviews where people say they have an oder problem, well I change mine every few days and have had no oder problems. I really like the fact that I can use any bag I want. I would definatly reccomend this product to afriend."
2,It's ok...if you change it daily,"We got the diaper champ as a shower gift. The one good thing about it is that you can use regular trash bags, so you don't have to buy specialty bags to fill it. The bad thing is that if you don't change it every other day, it stinks up the whole house. I have to bleach it once a week, not to mention keep a box of baking soda in the bottom to help control the smell. My daughter is now 2 years old, and I'm pregnant with our second. We are planning on getting rid of the diaper champ, and upgrading to diaper dekor."
5,Aixela was right!!!!,This is a great product and a good value for those on a budjet. Using lysol after changing the bag works well. I have used my Diaper champ for 3 years and it still works!! I recommed this product to everyone I know.
1,Doesn't Work,"If you are thinking about ordering this item and don't live in California, I'd rethink. We ordered one and it arrived in a box barely taped shut -- the box was not sturdy enough to survive mailing and was pretty flimsy. There was no padding or anything in the box to protect the product during shipping.The diaper champ doesn't work. The flip mechanism appears jammed and I can't figure out how to get it fixed. The instructions are no help, whatsoever. Customer service was closed the day I called. I'm sure it got damaged somehow in shipping.Anyway, I've messed with this stupid diaper pail as much as I am going to. They call it the ""easiest diaper pail to use."" I beg to differ."
2,it stinks - literally,"no matter how i scrub it - it stinks! its just a plastic garbage pail. don't even understand why it would work better than anything else. but to be honest, they haven't perfected any of them yet. so the choice is between smelly and smellier. good luck."
2,Didn't like,"I purchased the Diaper Champ for the same reason that most people do... no need to use special garbage bags. However, I was extremely disappointed in how difficult it is to get the top open to change the bags. I break a fingernail every time I have to do it!! Also, my daughter is only 3 months old and her diapers aren't even bad yet; unfortunately, after just a day of changing diapers (and making sure the diaper tags are secure), the darn thing is already difficult to flip. I'm sure it is great about keeping the odor down, but I have to change the bag every 2 days anyway because it is clogged up. I do not recommend it at all."
1,100% Junk,"We bought this thinking we were getting a great deal, an easy to use odorless pail that uses regular trash bags. WRONG! Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast. It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless. Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage."
1,Unless you don't mind the odor,It seemed to be fine until my baby started on solid food. She's now 7 months and the odor is unbearable. Most of the positive reviews were written by people with babies less than 6 months. I moved it from the nursery to a bathroom and every time I walked into the bathroom I could smell it pretty badly. I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS.
5,Over 3 years of daily use and going strong!,"We received a Diaper Champ as a baby shower gift when our daughter was born in March of 2004. We have been using it ever since, through her entire time in diapers and now we use it for our 1 year old son. It is simply fabulous. Extremely simple to operate, uses any bag, and we have had no stink trouble even with all that use (about 10,000 diapers and counting!). We were even able to keep using it when we switched our son to cloth diapers a few months back. I just use a nylon bag instead of a trash bag and it's a piece of cake. The Diaper Champ is one of my all-time favorite baby products."
4,"It works, but large diapers dont fit down the cylander & the container is small.","This product is great in the beginning when you have a tiny baby and tiny diapers. If you are nursing exclusively then the diapers aren't so bad to begin with and it does a great job of containing the smell. You do have to be sure to fold the diaper into a small ball to get it to fit down the cylander, and tape it shut, otherwise the diaper tabs can get stuck in the cylander as you turn it, and the diaper gets stuck. The can itself is pretty small too, so it needs to be emptied frequently (especially if you have twins like we do!)However, once your baby starts to grow and is in size 3 or 4 diapers, they get stuck even more and it is not a useful. Plus, the diapers get really heavy. We had to use trash compactor bags with it because regular trash bags would tear with the weight of the full pail."
2,Would not recommend,"Well, the only good thing about this product is that you can use regular household plastic garbage bags. Other than that it:1) Does a very poor job at controlling odors2) Difficult to open up to empty bag3) If you put wipes in by themselvet they can get stuckBy daughter is now 15 months and I am going out tomorrow to buy a new diaper pail"
3,3 stars for a potential danger,"This is a great diaper pail. We have used it for nine months now, and it does a great job at containing the odor and you can use any bags you want in it. However, now that my boy is moving about, I have realized a potential hazzard... the trash bag hangs over the edge to secure it in the pail. It is possible that he could grab the bag and tear off a piece of plastic. Of course he is not left in his room alone yet, but it still worries me. Overall this a good pail, but this is something to think about."
5,It's a champ!,"I am so glad I purchased the Diaper Champ. I was skeptical at first because it was so much cheaper and easier than the Genie. A store clerk recommended the Champ and I am so glad she did. I have used the other popular products and liked the way they controlled the odor, but found them more difficult to use. I like the convenience of the Champ. It controls odor, no turning dials, it holds several diapers, and I don't have to buy those annoying refills. I LOVE the fact that I can use my kitchen bags. It saves money and it's convenient."
3,It was good for a year,"I received the Diaper Champ as a gift when my baby girl was born last year. At first it seemed as the perfect way to keep diaper smells away; it worked like a charm. Within four to five months it started to smell, it did not seal properly and the smell got impregnated on the plastic, it was impossible to get rid of it. I tried to wash it, spray it, scrub it, but nothing. Maybe the sealing system fades with use. I used it till I couldn't anymore and two months ago bought the Diaper Genie. Yes, you have to buy refils ... it does a great job a sealing smells."
3,"The best of it's kind, but not the best option","This contains the smell and it uses regular bags which makes it the best product in its category. However, I never use it. It's so much easier just to throw the soiled diaper in a regular garbage bag and take the trash out often. We take ours out daily - this product tends to make you lazy and by the time you fill it - YUCK!Save your money and just throw your diapers in the trash."
2,"Right for Budget, Wrong for Nose!!!!!!!!!!","I was thrilled when I found out about this- a diaper disposal, using regular trash bags! Trust me- that is the ONLY benefit. The smell is putrid and I find myself placing the Diaper Champ outside to air out frequently. However, I would not pay for special Diaper Genie bags, either. It makes the most sense to wrap diapers in plastic bags and throw them out in the daily trash. It stinks- no pun intended!!!!!!!"
2,Too stinky for us,"I am rather disappointed in the Diaper Champ. My friend recommended it but now I question whether I would recommend to other's. While it is the easiest to use I find it doesn't contain the odor. I can actually smell it across the room. My son is six months old and eating solid foods so the diapers themselves are stinkier but we find that the Diaper Champ doesn't mask the odors. We have even tried a ""stick-up"" to no avail. I am now forced to just take the diapers directly outside.I also find opening it a challenge and not friendly to fingernails. It has cause much frustration in our household."
4,Works well,I chose the Diaper Champ because you are able to use standard trash bags. I hate to buy replacement items such as bags ( i usually forget). I works great. The only thing is when it is full it is full. It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it. I have not noticed any lingering oder in the baby's room and would recommend this item.
2,"The #1 only pail, at best.... NO #2 ALLOWED!","I purchased this pail about a year ago and found out right away that it will not control Ordor for #2 diapers. My cat box smells fresher! So, I used it for wet diapers only until I found that my now 1 1/2 year old son makes is own deposits...his toys! Oh and by the time the pail fills up with wet diapers, those smell too. The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back. So, the pail is now in our storage unit and we have a wicker basket with a lid (found free at a garage sale) lined with a garbage bag that sits on our deck right outside the sliding glass door. Diaper deposits are made there where it is easy to get too, the smell is outside and it can be emptied by my husband...outside!"
1,It reeks,"This diaper pail worked well at first - it was nice to just use a regular trash bag instead of spending more money on inserts, and it contained the smells. But then after a while, it started to really stink, even if it had just been emptied. I tried various cleaners and eventually just soaked the whole thing in bleach in the bathtub, but nothing got rid of the smell. It permeated the plastic and is there to stay. I guess if your kid potty trains when they turn one, maybe it is a good buy, but otherwise, skip it. Now, instead of being able to pass a useful baby item on to somebody else, I will have to throw it away, which is so wasteful, but nobody is going to want a stinky diaper pail!"
1,Jams and sticks,"Sorry, this thing is a dog. The blue plastic ring around each opening began to separate right away, and the top wouldn't swivel like it was supposed to. I was able to get it working for a week or two with some lubrication, but it just got stuck again. Wife hated it, I got tired of wrestling with it. Worthless."
2,Had Both Versions - Disappointed Both Times,"Our first was born in 2005 and we bought the original version of this diaper pail. It seemed so sensible. We liked it at first, but the smell just kept building...no matter how much I washed it and sprayed it with disinfectant. Then I realized the rounded part of the lid was lined with foam. Of course, once an odor gets into the foam you are doomed. So, I removed the foam, but we still had issues with odor. By now we had our 2nd baby and the pail seemed a little small for 2 in diapers (we emptied it more than twice a week). We bought the ""new improved"" version, since we still liked the concept of the pail. The smell issue is still attrocious and if a bag is really full it rips when you take it out. I had issues with the old version and I hate the newer version. I'm buying a really good trash can with a lid that seals out odors. We use one for cat litter and the smell NEVER escapes from that!"
3,Works well... early on,"We initially had no problems with this product... we were so happy to not be buying expensive trash bags. However, after our daughter started eating solid foods and the poop started to have a more powerful odor, the champ was easily KO'd. We still use the champ for wet diapers, but ended up buying the diaper genie for smelly ones... so we still get the benefit of cheap plastic bags for most of our diapers, but get the smell protection of the genie."
2,Hard to keep clean,My husband and I were all set to buy the Diaper Genie when someone came running up to us at Toys R Us and said to buy the Diaper Champ. So we did and it was great for a while...but then no matter how hard we tried (we always wrapped up the diaper but sometimes they do get messy) the chute started to get dirty and the weight started to get dirty from the other side so it smelled and was a mess. We tried to hose it off outside and let it sit in the sun but it still smelled. We ended up getting the Diaper Genie and it's clean and it works.
3,Diaper Champ - Not such a champ,"We have had this for 5 weeks now and its intent is well founded but the machanics or this device sometimes defeat its purpose. When rolling it over in dump mode into the bag system it will more times than not catch a diaper and clog the next time you try to insert your next disposal. Leaving you to open the system up, reach in and un-clog the stuck diaper. Needless to say you now have had a nice aroma and had to touch the diaper twice. Which in I and my wifes opinion could of been resolved with just using a standard trash can with a foot peddle to open. You will need to change the bags atleast every 3-5 days."
3,Great for the first couple of months,"Like some of the other reviews, I too sprayed with Lysol and changed bags frequently but still got a very foul odor from the Diaper Champ within a couple of months. I purchased this after I got tired of changing and buying refills for my diaper genie and it was a blessing but the smell of this became unbearable."
3,Great for the first year,"This is a great product until your little one starts to play with the handle. Because the flip-flop handle comes in contact with the dirty diapers when the bag gets full, curious fingers can pick up some nasty germs & even poop if a diaper isn't wrapped up into itself (The Grandmas seem to have trouble with that).I have been very happy with the simplicity of the Champ & using regular garbage bags until now. However, my 14 month old loves to play with it & flip the handle over. I just cringe when I think about what he gets on his hands.Also, the padding in the lid that keeps odor under control seems to have worn out after 1 year. It came loose, we had to pull it out & there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too. YUCK!Overall, I would recommend the Champ for infants because it's VERY easy & you can use 1 hand, but now that I have a toddler I'm looking for a pail with a locking lid."
1,Only because you can't pick 0,I got the diaper champ for my first baby. I thought it would be great since it used regular trash bags. It wasn't even two weeks after my son was born when the seal came out and his room smelled awful. I threw it away. It was the biggest waste of money. I bought the Diaper Genie and it's worth having to buy the special bags. It works wonderfully.
1,Stinks,"This diaper pail stinks, literally. We purchased this one to save a few bucks. It smells within minutes with one diaper in it. We tried using scented trashbags...didn't work. It was a total waste of money.The Diaper Dekor and Diaper Dekor Plus are fabulous. You have to buy special bags but they are worth it. I'll never buy anything else again"
