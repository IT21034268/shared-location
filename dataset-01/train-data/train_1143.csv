4,give it a shot,black jack is not a bad movie at all .sure it has a few flaws with plot and dialogue but hey its a t.v movie for a series and it could ahve been a lot worse if john woo hadnt done it but he is what makes the movie.sure this isnt his greatest work but its a fun movie to watch and faceit hes never gonna top the killer but for those who want to see a good john woo flick try one of his hong kong ones but if your a die hard fan youll love this one just fo rthe action.
5,All time favorite,"Dolph Lundgren is excellent in this high explosive action pack thriller that will have you hanging on the edge of your seat for more!!The bad guys don't stand a chance, even losing his sight he is still too much to handle. The color white is a threat to him while going up against the bad guys you have to find out who will win?"
3,seen better,this is not the best john woo move. i though it started pretty good and the story was kindoff original. but the longer the movie lasted the more boring it got. but it is worth watching if ure just renting it :)
1,John Woo's worst movie,"Doplh Lundgren (Silent Trigger, Peacekeeper) stars in, yet another action thriller. This time Lundy tackles the role of a man who is hired to protect a beautiful model who is being stalked and threatened by a evil mad man. Lundgren and the baddie go head to head but there's one problem with Lundgren...years ago he had an accident and from there he is lacktose in tolerant which he cant stand the color white. The badguy uses this to his advantage which creates a corny showdown where Lundgren is blinding by white. John Woo's worst movie and putting Lundgren in it was a mistake also. The model is hot but this movie is not. I'm sensing a pattern in the movies Lundgren always picks..he's sorta doing the same thing, Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme are doing. Lundgren has only died in one movie that I remember and that was Universal Soldier..Seagal died in Executive Decision and Van Damme in a few. Well,, you get my point I hope"
2,Pretty Mediocre,"An action copycat movie without a very good plot. Not up to action genre standards. Some bad dialogue and an even worse plot. You see this guy bouncing around and shooting two guns, but if you pay attention you can easily see that he wouldn't hit a thing the way he aims the guns. A lot of people get shot. That is the story in a nutshell."
5,Very romantic movie in a time when its needed.,"This is not one of S.Lewis' best stories,however Spencer Tracy, and Lana Turner weave a lovely interlude of romance not really seen in too many movies today. In its simplicity, it moves steadily and sometime predictably but still with innocence and sweetness. I loved it. MD"
4,For People Who Like Cats,"Cats in Space is a fun little collection of science fiction stories involving cats. Fritz Leiber's Spacetime for Springers is about an ordinary home as seen by the family cat. It is the only story told by a cat. The other stories in the first section are about how people in space are affected by their cats by authors like Heinlein and Clarke. The second section of the book is a little strange as it has stories about catlike aliens such as the k'zin. These are very good stories, but they are not really cat stories. Overall, this is an enjoyable anthology of excellent stories for anyone who likes cats."
1,Most disappointing movie I've ever seen in my life,"Most disappointing movie I've ever seen in my life. Story telling, acting, directing- its just the wonder of the worst that movie can be.I'm feeling guilty of not being able to give it 0 star."
5,'Pumped' for S Club(7),"BONUS TRACKS!!!!! ""Everybody Get Pumped"" for this CD. Some of S Club(7)'s BEST music! My favorites, ""S Club Party"", ""Show Me Your Colours"", ""Love Ain't Gunna Wait For You"", ""Everybody Get Pumped"", ""Don't Stop Movin'"", and ""Say Goodbye"". BUY THIS CD!!!!! You'll LOVE IT! Gets ya 'pumped'!"
5,Excellent for the public and pastoral caregivers,"Joretta Marshall writes this book not only for pastoral caregivers, but also for the general public. She clearly defines words such as lesbian, homosexuality, heterosexism, sexism and identity. This book is a wonderful introduction for how the wider public can best relate to and affirm women who are in covenantal partnerships with other women. She also emphasizes the crucial importance of the role that pastoral caregivers play in counseling women in lesbian relationships. It is imperative, she says, that pastoral caregivers affirm lesbians in their relationships as well as challenge institutions, such as the church, to accept and affirm the relationships that women have with women."
3,vintage review,"many crocheters are looking for those patterns from yesteryear. these patterns bring back that ""feeling of home and security"". in the back of our minds, we remenber seeing these patterns on grandma's , auntie Lou's, and our mothers couches, tables, and beds. now, it is our turn to produce the same ""feelings of home"" for our children and grandchildren. we forgot to ask our mothers, grandmothers, and aunts, how these beautiful pieces were made, and how sorry we are for that. but, all is not lost, we can find those beautiful patterns in this book. LG Moyer"
4,Great history and great photos,"As a Flight Engineer on the B314 for three years I shudder at the thought that future aviation buffs will take this as the ""bible"". I think the author was drunk when he wrote about crew duties and procedures!"
1,And further more--from a technical veiwpoint,I ordered the book from you before it was issued. I was one of the first ones to get it. I am a technical person who correct all my books (in ink) for technical errors. I read it the first day and had at least two technical errors corrected on most every page. I went to this site and an a guy had already commented on his poor writing. I wrote (futhermore- there was a least one technical error on each page) I later checked with the publisher and found the they do not have an editor---WHAT HAPPEND TO MY COMMENTS ???
5,Hell Yeah Bitch!!!,"Korn is the BEST. They are better than any other band I've ever heard. Their best C.D. would have to be ""Life is Peachy"" I love these Guys so much. That's all I gotta say. Words can't express how cool they really are."
4,A.D.I.D.A.S. is a great song.,"If you don't have Korn's Life is Peachy c.d., you should at least have this single. This has one of Korn's best songs on it, and any Korn fan should have it."
3,"Just by life is peachy, don't buy this singal","A.D.I.D.A.S. is a sweet song, but it's sorta a waste of your money on this singal, the remixes in my opinion suck. JUst by peachy and you'l have to original and best."
2,Just ok...,"All the remixes sound the same, and aren't really THAT great at that. Get it for as cheap as you can."
4,"Good plot, accurate in locations","As one who currently lives and works on Kwajalein, the locations depicted in the book are right on the money. The plot keeps the action going until the very end. Recommended."
5,Sub Zero,Very good book from start to finish. Very detailed but not overdone. Looking foward to his next novel.Would recomend to all military buffs.
3,interest,"To be truful, it didn't impress me enough so that I now remember the story, also it's been quite awhile since I finished reading it."
2,Good thing it was cheap,"Too much repetition in every chapter. could have been a good book, but with all the BS and needless information, it fails to make the grade."
1,have not read,I am an old submariner and was interested in reading. Then I bought an Kindle and have been reading that since.
4,Good book,Surprisingly good book to read for a free book. A few twists and turns kept it interesting not a bad book
5,SUB ZERO,Great Story could not put it down. Read it in two evenings. Provided good tech details on submarine warfare and missile deployment.
2,not for macs!,i didn't know that the templates aren't made for macs- and the alternative software doesn't work well at all. i've given up!
4,Memorex cd/dvd labels,I enjoy using the Memorex labels. They are excellent quality and easy to use. I always bought them from retail outlets but nobody carries them anymore. I bought a rival brand and got fewer labels for more money. It was truly worth it to order in bulk from Amazon.com. I will continue to get this product online.
2,Not what's advertised,"These particular Memorex CD labels are a much lower quality then what is advertised here. The Memorex product number on the bottom of the sheet is different than the one shown in the picture. I don't think the seller has any control over this. It appears that Memorex decided to use lower quality materials and sell them as the same thing to save a little on the bottom line. However, the difference in quality is very obvious to anyone who uses photos on thier CD covers."
1,"""FREE"" software would not download.","I kept clicking on the free download option, but all I got was ads trying to get me to buy versions of Memorex software. I finally got tired of trying to get Memorex to make good on their offer whereupon I decided to cut my losses, trash their useless (to me) labels, and firmly resolve to avoid all Memorex products in the future."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased these sideburns for a themed 2nd wedding ceremony my husband and I had in Vegas this past July. The price was reasonable and it arrived on time but the quality was trash! The colour was much lighter than advertised, the adhesives were difficult to manipulate (we ended up having to use scotch tape), and the hair was continually falling out. Overall, a poor choice for any costume."
3,missing shims,"part was fine,if you replace this make sure you use the old shims or inserts that are on the old bolts,they go up inside the lower control arm, IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS THE BOLTS WILL SNAP OFF AND CAR WILL BE TOTALED"
4,great read,"Ive read a lot of science fiction and fantasy novels. I found this to be a very comfortable read. It kept me interested thru the entire book.I loved the mix of explanation for vampires, elves, undead with a touch of quantum physics (levels of existence). It added a nice logical touch to a great adventure/romance."
2,It was a little boring,"It wasn't so bad, I kept reading it to the end. I probably won't read anything else in the series."
1,A Marvin Gaye fan,I was very disappointed with this CD. The sound quality was poor and you could actually hear feedback. Marvin had a lot of trouble with his voice range. This recording should have never been made available to the public and I definately do not recommend it.
1,This is heresy!,"You should all be aware of the fact that Hagin is not following the principles according to my bible. Nowhere does my bible tell me that I shall never be sick. As a matter of fact Timothy who was one of Paul's closest associates, he was sick and suffered from several diseases. That's why Paul told him to drink some wine. If you don't believe me just check your bible. I'm praying for all of those who believe Hagin is right, and I do hope that Jesus will show you what is right. I would like to recommend my favorite author: Max Lucado. He is much better to read than Hagin, no offense. God bless you all who visit this page. Jesus is alive!"
4,mowed over,"This is the cutest mower. My son loves playing with it, as well with the other pieces of playskool's yard crew. And it is great that it has an on/off switch!"
4,LOUD LOUD Mower!,My son loves this mower and I think it is awfully cute but man is it LOUD! If you are going to use this as an outside toy it shouldn't be an issue but if you plan on keeping this inside be prepared for some noise! I can handle it but it drives my hubby crazy!
3,Noisiest toy~,"This toy is definitely an outdoor toy, it's terribly loud! I ordered it for my son who always ""borrowed"" the neighbor boy's bubblemaker lawnmower. Because he liked it, I should have gotten the exact one as the neighbors,not because it blows bubbles,(they had problems with theirs not blowing bubbles after the 1st use), but this one was a couple of $$$ less so I chose it, plus it looked cute,(but scared my 14 mo. old son initially). Now he's not scared of it but still doesn't seek it out to play with. Oh well, another garage sale item."
1,Fun and very loud,"I hate this toy, which is a shame because both my 17 month old boy and almost 3 year old girl loves it. The little head on the mower chomps very, very noisily when pushed. To fix the noise issue, simply removing the batteries does nothing. We were gifted this by the grandparents for Christmas, along with the playskool vacuum which we love and isn't terribly loud. While they were playing with the lawn mower, we was unable to hear or communicate easily with the grandparents on our web cam because of the noise level. You cannot keep this toy out if you have a napping small child and a playing older child. You cannot talk on the phone, have a conversation with someone in the same room, or sleep if someone is playing with this toy. Bad for migraine sufferers. Terrible for pets/kids with fear of loud noises.Great if you keep it outdoors and your neighbors don't mind."
4,My grandson loves it!!!!,I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He turned a year old in November. I thought maybe it would help give him something to hang on to while he tries to walk. He was just beginning to try to walk around. His mother told me he just loves this toy!!! she sent me a picture once of him sitting on it and said he must have wanted a riding mower!! LOL she says it's his favorite toy and it says lots of different things that make him laugh!!
3,Okay but a little scary for my 1 year old,"I purchased this for my 1 year old daughter for Christmas because she was always playing with her brother's lawn mower. Well, she doesn't play with it at all. My son (who is 3) plays with it more than my daughter. The mouth on the mower moves up and down when it's being pushed and the faster you push is the faster the mouth moves. It can be slightly obnoxious. I haven't even heard what he says because the mouth makes so much noise. Overall, it entertains my 3 year old but I think it's partly because he can scare his sister with it."
4,Fun toy with obnoxious voice,"My kids love this lawn mower--it really makes them think they are mowing the lawn, and it is great exercise for them! It also keeps them from wanting to play with the real lawn mower. The lawn mower talks, however, and the things it says are quite silly and obnoxious and drive me crazy a bit. Things like ""this grass is tasty!"" and ""let's give this lawn a buzz cut!"" But, it's all about them (I have [...] triplets) and they all love it."
5,FAVORITE 2 Year Old TOY!,"My son is two and just loves this toy. You can use it both indoors or outdoors. It is very cute...talks, moves it's mouth and has lots of really cute phrases. He just loves it. It is a great gift."
2,Cute only if you want your kids to be pigs.,"In its phrase rotation, it belches twice. Once, it follows it with, ""Oops, that was me."" That's not what I want to teach my kids. They'd like it just the same if it made a soft mowing sound as opposed to these loud obnoxious phrases."
1,rude and scary,"our 14 month old son received this as a xmas gift and the face and noises terrified him and repelled us with the rude phrases, so we took out the batteries. He still would get scared of it every once in a while. Once snapped together, it does not break down for easy packing. We decided to leave it at the grandparents house and gave them permission to give it away. We just bought him a john deere and it's working out well. The Little Tikes one also seems like a good choice."
2,Playskool Chompin Mower,"I bought this for my son & daughter to play with.Neither one even touches it.Just sits there never moves.I really dont know how to rate it,But it must be really boring for them not to even play with it.So don't bother buying it.I should have gotten the bubble one.ArmyWife"
5,"A fun, beautifully illustrated book",My two year old daughter adores this book. It was the first real story book she warmed up to and we've read it hundreds of times. The story is funny and sweet. The illustrations are absolutely beautiful while being whimsical and amusing in their own right. A great read that I would recommend to anyone.
4,The amusement is in the details.,"Rob Scotton, Russell the Sheep (HarperCollins, 2005)Harper contacted me about reviewing this about an aeon ago, and I completely forgot until I stumbled across the email in an inbox-cleaning a few weeks ago. Mea maxima culpa.Russell the Sheep is an adorable little tale of an insomniac sheep (named, not surprisingly, Russell). The tale itself is nothing special, but the illustrations are fantastic. Scotton has worked in a number of wonderful little details that will amuse both kids and the parents reading this to them, topping the whole thing off with a wonderfully calming color scheme. This is fun stuff, and highly recommended if you've got little ones around the house. Or, actually, if you don't. ****"
4,Creative and Fun:,"I bought this book for my three year old daughter due to the large scale, full color, creative illustrations found within. I was satisfied at the safe content of the story as well as the over all visuals."
5,Adorable and Entertaining!,"July 16, 2005Have you ever found yourself unable to fall asleep? I have, and on more than one occasion! Like most of us humans, Russell sure does the same. In Frogsbottom Filed, an energetic Russell is restless. Trying desperately to go to sleep, he tosses and turns.Young readers will be amused at the sight of Russell as he prances atop a tree while one sheep brushes its teeth; another is practically falling asleep while clutching a teddy bear, yet another lies under a quilt with its four feet straight up in the air. Russell counts objects, fluffs his pillow, and even after he pulls the shade over his eyes, remains wide-awake!Russell the Sheep is an adorable tale that is wonderfully illustrated, bringing this character to life. Rob Scotton's creation is sure to grab the hearts and imaginations of young and old alike!Reviewed by Betsie"
5,A wonderful book!,"This book for children is wonderful. My doughter is 4 month old only but she is spellbound to look ""Russel""..."
2,Far Cry from Perfection of Earlier Albums,"This new ""best of"" is more like ""made for the masses."" In recent years, Cafe del Mar has lost the mediterranean veranda with a touch of Spanish sophistication and funky break beat feel. It's more like wanna be 40 year old dinner music, or cheesy ""get you in bed"" tunes that would make a classy bird run for dear life. One of the tracks takes you back to braveheart and bagpipes, come on! There are a couple of good tracks, but I'd grab one of their earlier albums instead."
4,Buen Sabor de Boca,"Esta es la primer obra que leo del autor y creo que no sera la ultima, su manera super-descriptiva de narrar las cosas es genial. Puede ser de esos libros que al tiempo los querras volver a leer y con el riesgo de quedar aun con mejor sentimiento.NO esta nada fuera de lo 'normal' de como son los 'sistemas politicos' en latinoamerica con respecto a la manera de hacer campaña. Lo que diferencia a este respetable alcalde es que en realidad el si daba hasta lo suyo por ayudar a la gente, y su 'alcalde civico' lo ayudaba sin esperar nada a cambio."
2,"Missing parts, too!","I received my kit late last Friday and have the same problem as the last reviewer: two of the umbrellas are missing their mounting attachments (which also screw onto the light clamps to hold them on), so two of the three lights cannot be used! Due to the weekend and upcoming holiday I have not yet been able to reach Smith Victor about obtaining the missing parts, so do not know if I shall receive the same runaround as my predecessor did.Since at least two purchasers have had the same problem with missing parts, it would seem to be a chronic one involving this product...."
2,Radio stars on film,"This film reveals a sober truth about the major radio programs of the 1930s and 1940s: they weren't very funny. You can learn that by listening to tapes of the old shows, or you can watch this movie, which revolves around Fred Allen and features Jack Benny. Sadly, there isn't a laugh in the film. There is much absurdity and many attempts to be humorous, but nothing comes off. It's like an Olson and Johnson film. It's In The Bag is an embarrassment for Fred Allen, Don Ameche, Jerry Colonna, and William Bendix fans. Jack Benny admirers have long learned to expect this sort of thing from his movies. The Robert Benchley bit may be the worst he ever filmed--and that's saying something! Binnie Barnes is competent and still beautiful at 40, but her lines don't give her much to work with. In short, this is a dud, best forgotten."
4,One of Radio's better Movies,"There have been numerous attempts at fashioning movie vehicles for radio stars:most of them failed to work,or work consistently well,but It's In The Bag is something of an exception.Starring Fred Allen-who had a great face for radio-and featuring cameos from Jack Benny,Robert Benchley,Don Ameche,Rudy Valee,and William Bendix,this is a simple,plot-driven movie packed full with in-jokes and tried-and-tested routines.Mel Brooks would return to the source material - a Russian short story - for the 1970 movie The Twelve Chairs,but the pretentiousness of that version is missing here.If you like Benny(who is on fine form) and Allen(who is at his most appealing,or least unappealing,depending on your perspective)then It's In The Bag is well worth a look."
5,dragon slayers academy,Thanks for making these available to us. Scholastic doesn't seem to have them in their flyers anymore. Our twins love these books.
2,Does not support RAID 1 mirroring,"Despite the ""Tech Specs"" of Amazon, the WD NetCenter does not support RAID 1 (mirroring) configuration. According to a Western Digital representative in their forums, ""RAID functionality was tested with this device but was not implemented on the final product due to lack of interest from our beta testers. This feature may be implemented on future enterprise based external products, but will not be implemented on the NetCenter hard drive."""
5,I really like it,"This was a great addition to my home network. I needed a little extra storage, and rather than going to buy another internal harddrive, I bought this. It works great, though may not be perfect for novice users, but it's not impossible either. Very straightfoward, but for more advanced features make sure you're familiar with basic networking. Otherwise, this product would be great for anyone. Definitely recommended."
1,Their support sucks big time!,"If the support phone line is busy, you don't even get put on hold. You get a message to call back and it drops the call. The email support can take weeks. You get one little hint at a time. I will NEVER buy their product again. NEVER!"
4,"Solid performer, a bit noisy.","This thing has been serving as my music and backup server for about two months now, and has performed solidly. I can't really comment on speed since I use it wirelessly and am limited at 1-2 Mb/sec due to my connection. Its a bit noisy, but since it sits in the basement, not a problem. Has been continuously powered for the whole while I've had it without problem. Showed up immediately upon plugging it in, not even sure why I installed the software."
5,works great!,I have never had another external harddrive but this was so easy to set up and works great so far. I can access it all the time from either of our laptops.
3,An insight into the personality of Bruce Lee,"This book gave me a further insight into the kind of person Bruce Lee was. This is due to my reading a couple of others about him. The impression that was most re-inforced was that he was a positive minded person. The other thing I picked up here was that he was the kind of person who always evaluated himself on a regular basis to see how he could improve etc.The bad thing about thing about this book is the interviews with the interviewers; these are nothing more than opinions about Bruce by men who, in my book, didn't know Bruce long enough to warrant their opinions to be worth printing in a book. I think these were included to give volume to the book. Because I was only interested in Bruce's own words, I learned nothing from these bits. (It is because of these wasteful bits I only given 3 stars)"
3,Not enough suggestion cards,"This is a fun game but there are 3 times more ""trophy"" cards then there are playing cards. There are 4 suggestions on one playing card so once you have seen the card you have a better chance of guessing what another person is doing since you have seen all the possibilities."
3,great idea but needs updating,"Got this book for my 17 year old granddaughter, but it was so old (not updated) I think she probably never even looked at it. Glad I didn't spend a lot of money on this."
3,Need a 2006 Version,"Someone needs to compile a new ""lowdown on higher education"". I own the 1992 edition and it was ok (ok enough for me to still own it. It's still in my UCMS cubicle in Oak Brook) but version 2.0 15 years hence needs1) More than 200 schools.2) More than one co-author Annette Geldzahler3) More campus slangs and local lingo4) Social websites and party gatherings5) Parents weekends and homecoming/alumni eventsA theme of Fiske Guide meets ""Irreverent Guide to Paris"" for about 800 schools would be ideal."
3,A Possible Joyride Sequel,"I work in a video store and got to rent Black Cadilliac before its released so I can tell people like you about it so here we are, this is an ok movie but the basic style of it I've seen before, If you have watched the movie Joyride your just about getting the same thing..The movie starts off with the boys in a bar and then a fight going on in which the boys later on end up driving around in the darrk winter of Wisconnsin while trying to get back to Minnesota only to be flagged down by an off duty cop(Randy Quaid), Quaid's character is fairly decent in this film and in my opinion he definetely helps carry the film because he really is the only recognizable actor I saw in the movie..The ending is fairly twisted and with sort of a suprise but for what its worth this is a pretty good movie to look at, I would suggest this more of a rental than one you wanna buy..."
1,The Worst....,"Some really bad movies are fun to watch. This isn't. A quarter of the way through the movie I was praying that the Black Cadillac would catch up with our ""heroes"" and swiftly kill them. It didn't. This movie's a real life turd."
3,"A Good Scare, but bad language though!","The movie does a good job with the creepiness and the scares in the movie. The chase scenes are pretty good as well. The only problem I have with the movie is the bad language that flies through out the movie. During the scene where the boys start fighting with each other outside the car, the bad language really flies, the movie would have been better without the bad language. I guess movie writers and producers just assume that everyone talks like that. I know I don't, I also don't like hearing it either. I would have give it a 4 out 5, but the language hurts it. 2 1/5 out of 5."
4,Pretty good small budget movie,"While not the best movie I've ever seen, this movie does what it sets out to do - draw the viewer in for some thriller action.2 friends and a little brother have travelled to Wisconsin for an evening of booze and girls at a backwoods bar in the winter. After a barroom brawl a 1950s Cadillac menaces them and eventually persues them - but our 3 protagonists have no idea why.Unlike some spoilsport reviewer on this page, I won't tell anything more so that you'll be surprised at the end.Randy Quaid is the only actor you're likely to recognize but, in my mind, young, pez-consuming Josh Hammond steals the show."
4,A true B thriller,"Ok, this wasn't the best movie and it wasn't the worst either. I was getting the feeling that the black cadillac was a paranormal vehicle until it was revieled that it wasn't. It did remind me of the movies Christine and Dead End but was a little different. I was also wondering through the whole movie where in WI this took place. I live here and was just curious. The movie was scarey and funny at times. I recommend this movie to someone that likes a thriller that is not gorey."
3,not what I expected,It was an alright movie. Not one I would watch again but interesting. I wouldn't buy it. Why do you need so many words with these reviews?
5,I was...,"pleasantly surprised by this movie, it got my attention from start to finish something I find almost impossible these days specially with all the garbage hitting movie theatres these days."
5,"Good movie to not think about, just enjoy.","I pretty much got what I wanted with this film. A bit predictable, but not something to think about. A nice one for simply relaxing and watching the Black Cadillac chase these guys. No real surprises, just B movie type fun. The language is not kid friendly, so bear that in mind. A bit slow in places as one other review suggested, but still kept my interest until the end. I will keep it on the watch again list."
3,NOT A PINK CADILLAC!,Fairly good movie with a good cast. You're not sure where Randy Quaid stands but you figure it out eventually. The story flows and the action is good.
5,Ed McMahon Was Right!,"After I heard the music from this CD at the Ed McMahon Show in Branson, Missouri, I bought it. This has to be the best recording of patriotic music I've ever heard. The singers are Metropolitan Opera material and the band clearly employs many of the best bandsmen in the U.S. Armed Services."
3,Middle of the road.,The American National Military Band is great. The singing is awful. It would have been much better to have remove the singing and just have an instrumental CD. This is a 5 star CD with 5 star music but the singer drops it to 3 stars. Would have been 1 star if there weren't a few well done instrumental songs in it.
1,Didnt notice a difference,"I didnt notice a difference with milk production at all, even though I took most of the bottle as directed."
3,"Blended Collection of Fairies, but Not All Beautiful","Before I purchased this item, I have already search a lot of fairy pictures from different web sites, many of them are the same or even much more beautiful than that in ""500 Fairy Motifs"". Thus, I am quite disappointed!However, if you like to have a hard copy collection including different style no matter it is beautiful or not, it maybe your good choice.The small size and hard cover of this book is suitable for collection.You can find different fairy style from different artist, and the web sit of different artist listed at the last page is useful."
3,500 Fairy Motifs,"Beautiful little book. Delightful collection from various artists - shame they cannot be copied.... some are 'way out' - CAT fairies?? but inspiring to the fairy devotee. Particularly liked designs from the author, Myrea Pettit also Erin Minks: but that is a personal choice - there are mny other contributions from a variety of artists displaying alternative styles and ideas (inc. a few elves). The author's passion for the subject, and inclusion of contact sites for all contributors is to be commended."
2,"Not so much an art book, or art study book.......","I gave this one to my 3 year old daughter. It looked a little too much like a childrens art book. there wasn't much to except a bunch of pictures from artists. and alot of them are fair artistry and a few that are really good. it reminds me alot of the cheap coloring books you buy, but already colored."
1,Better Fairy Books out there,This book was extremely disappointing. There were a few artists whose work was up to par but many of the drawings were bizarre and/or a high school student could have drawn better. Don't even waste your money!
3,Its Ok.,"If you're looking for the Johnny ""history periods"" then add it to your collection. Otherwise if this is your first DVD of Carson consider this as an ""introduction"" piece."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this video. I thought it was for the Tonight Show but it was very early Johnny Carson. Some of it was funny, but it certainly wasn't what I thought it would be."
2,Disappointing -,"Love Johnny Carson, and have even been to the home where he was raised in Norfolk, Nebraska. However, he just wasn't that funny at the beginning of his career - in fact, I'm surprised he went from this to stardom. I think teaming up with Ed McMahon was a big help to Carson's career."
2,Here Is...The Johnny Carson Show,"Johnny Carson was very young and he stated, that he only been in the business for two years and it showed. I did not enjoy it,because he wasn't funny. I guess time and experience made him hilarious."
3,Excellent but...,"When I was a child, I loves this Cartoon. It is excellent to have a new opportunity to have a part of my remembers as a boy through this. But is a pity that the DVD collection does not have the Spanish version."
1,Supertroopers Flop,"It is hard to review an item that you can not view. I have tried re-downloading this item half a dozen times using Unbox Video. Every time I try playing this video It locks up my computer. The Unbox video will let you delete the files then the next time you run the software it will automatically download it, so you can not get rid of the file once you purchase it."
2,Swisher 60-Inch Lawn Roller #12886,Shipping crate was poor and damaged in shipment allowing (minimal but repairable) damage to roller. Information that the Roller was only 14 inchs in diameter rather than larger was missing from any internet sources and pictures were deceiving thus the the roller was found to be smaller in diameter that expected. The roller tow bar was not made out of as heavy of material as I would have desired (1 inch square stock that had only eight inch walls). Otherwise it was OK.
4,THE PRINCE OF PRAISE,NOW YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY I ONLY GAVE HIM 4 STARS. I GAVE HIM 4 STARS BECUASE I THINK THAT AT THE END OF THE ALBUM ITS GETS A LITTLE WEAK. I WASNT LIKE THE BEGINNING OF THE CD WHERE THE SPIRIT IS. I THINK THAT HE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING BETTER. ANYWAYS. OTHER THAN THAT THIS CD IS AWESOME. I LOVE IT. I COULDNT WAIT TO GET IT AND NOW THAT I HAVE IT. I AM BLESS. THIS CD IS AWESOME. EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THIS THIS IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Praise God for I know B.C. is truly anointed with song.,"I purchase this CD after hearing one song on the radio. I tried not one, but two different gospel music stores. One of the stores told me they will not have any in until Friday. I think GOD and Byron for his beautiful praise and worship music. I look forward to listening to this CD in my car and at home. I also rate this CD not 5 start but 100 start."
1,Couldn't finish it,"Tries to watch it. Language was so nasty and unending vulgarity we turned it off. I have a moderate tolerance for that sort of thing, but this was way too much. Unfortunately, I think this is the trend."
1,"Great cast, that was about it","We picked this movie, strictly for the actors starring in it. I expected it to be a good laugh. After about 20 minutes, we just gave up. The movie wasn't funny. The story wasn't interesting. This was a waste of time and money."
1,Wow,"I was prepared for some mindless entertainment. I got mindless, but they left out the entertainment. Maybe wait until this becomes Prime eligible (i.e., free) before investing a few hours."
1,Waste of money,Horrible moves... So boring and stupid!!! I wish I would have never rented this & it was so bad I feel like I should get my money back
3,Not my cup of tea...,This movie was entertaining as best. Not my favorite actors or genre. My young adult children enjoyed it more than I.
2,Garbage!!!,What a waste of time and money! Such a great cast! What a shame! Do yourself a favor and save yourselfs the agony!
1,The Watch,"You would think that with this all star cast that this movie would be great, but it is very far from that. Vince Vaughn was hilarious as usual but he was the only good thing about that movie. Horribly written and I am so disappointed with how bad it was!"
1,Please stop making these!!!,"This movies is absolute trash, I am tired on penis joke movies, come on, make actual comedies and stop throwing idiots together and see what sticks, lazy hollywood slop once again. If it has vince vaughn run in the other direction is my new motto."
2,I felt brain cells dying as it watched this movie ..,Quite frankly this was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It was supposed to be a comedy but was not funny at all. Vince vaughn plays the same douchy moron he plays in every movie .. which I pretty much expected. Jona Hill had a minor role .. and again wasn't even funny .. he didn't really do much in this movie .. which was a dissappointment. Ben Stiller was the biggest dissappointment though. Even though yet again he played a neurotic weirdo I had higher expectations that he'd atleast hold this movie together. I don't mind some raunchy topics as long as they are intermingled with some comedy. This movie was just crude and rude .. which is apparently all hollywood is capable of anymore. When the guys walked into a room and saw some guys circle jerking I almost turned the tv off .. was that seriously necessary????
2,Stupid Funny,It's a stupid-funny movie with a terrible plot..If you like will ferral movies you will probably like this movie
3,the watch,"kinda funny, wortha watch . hbvkas k;asjbdksd k;sjdbv; ;kasjdbv ;ksdjv ;kasjdv ws 'onv daj svd sv e e s a"
2,This Movie Stinks Beyond Belief,Very stupid. Very boring. Not funny. Total waste of time and money. Makes really really bad movies look good. Finally put me to sleep and ended my misery.
2,It was okay,This movie was not what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be about a group of guys doing the neighborhood watch. I felt like it had a few funny parts. I'm a big fan of Ben Stiller so I was definitely surprised that I did not like the movie. I do not recommend this movie. It was hard for me to stay interested in it.
3,Good movie,Good movie not great. Need to be in the mood for a slap stick type movie. There are some funny parts but the the movie is a litte weird??
3,Funny but to off the wall,Parts where very funny with a off the wall twist about aliens. Worth seeing if you want a good laugh.
2,It's ok,This movie was an average movie. I was not impressed. I did not laugh at this movie. I could tell when the actors had been allowed to run free cause the scene felt choppy during those times. The humor was not that funny either.
1,This movie is a waste of money,I love movie and I've seen a lot of them and this movie is one of the worst ones ever. It is not funny It is not even a good story.
3,"Rent it, dont buy","This movie is totally worth renting. It has some funny parts, keeps you entertained...but is also a little too long. All in all id say skip buying it but rent it if your a fan of any of the cast. Youll enjoy"
3,Better than expected,I must say I enjoyed the movie. It was better than expected and I'll recommend it. Good cast. Producers didn't spare any expense when it came to special effects and make up.
3,generally okay,"This movie if anything is entertaining but mostly a dull movie. If you've watched the previews, then you got some of the best parts. Don't watch the previews and the move turns out a bit better."
3,Expected more,"I'm not sure why I expected more, perhaps it's because of my huge crush on Vince Vaughn. The movie has a couple of funny points, but overall it was just ok."
5,movie for older teens/adults,"funny movie, good humor but some scenes are very racy/sexual/ that would require no kids watch the movieOtherwise, for the 18+ crowd its a good laugh!"
3,movie,it was okay nothing to write home about there was some funny parts but it was just so-so thank you
2,language.... ???,the plot of the movie was funny and interesting.. but the language.. and some of the subjects... oh my.. i cringed...kinda ruined the whole experience for me... love ben stiller and vince vaughn... but...
2,Movie Pro,"This movie had quite a few talented actors in it. It's just a shame that the content was garbage. Tom Hanks was in the movie The Burbs which is similar to this in story line...However, The Burbs was worth watching and The Watch is nothing but trash. These producers need to wake up and quit making movies that are for the mindless dummies who don't care if they're filling their heads with crap: Magic Mike, The Watch, Human Centipede. Please, this is America, have a little bit of class."
2,Okay,Same humor seen in countless movies- crude without punchline and actors playing their expectant roles. couple funny scenes the rest very formulaic.
2,Horrible Plot & Not Very Well Written,Could have been much better for a comedy that takes place at Costco.Aliens + Costco = Boring.Skip this one and wait until it comes on Comedy Central.
2,Very disapointing,The alien nonsense ruined the whole movie. Very disappointing. The combination of actors could have made for a hilarious experience. To Bad
4,"Pretty funny, def worth watching.",Pretty funny movie. Was gonna catch it in theatres but so much cheaper on Amazon. Dont know if it would have been worth it to pay move ticket price though.
4,Fun and Surprising,Surprising movie. Nothing what I expected. Great movie for winding down and a few laughs. Will watch this movie again.
4,Really funny,I heard lots of mixed reviews about this movie. I really enjoyed it and thought it was hillarious. I was laughing majority of the movie.
2,We couldn't finish it!,"To much bad language and sexual situations! There are funny parts, but all the other stuff just turned us off."
2,Worth renting but not that great,had a few laughs in it to make it worth renting but would not consider it a buy-worthy movie at all.
2,Very Bad Language,"The movie itself is funny enough, and yes I knew it would have some bad language in it, but this movie is over the top with the ""F"" word..No recommendation here. Sorry"
2,Boring,The plot line was so ridiculously thrown together. Wonderful actors so I thought it would be a great movie but I was let down.
2,Would not watch it again!,This is probably one of the worst movies I have seen with Ben Stiller. The plot is just akward and the movie is not funny over all. Dont pay for it. See it when out on TV.
2,Review,It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. I was disappointed in the movie. Very disappointed in the movie
1,Terrible!,The actors are as expected. It could have been funny but as usual Hollywood writers think we are all 15 year old boys. This type of humor Is a waste of talent.
2,"Couldn't wait for this movie to be over, with all the funny actors it should have been WAY better then it was.","Couldn't wait for this movie to be over, with all the funny actors it should have been WAY better then it was."
1,The Un - Watch,"Terrible movie with a plot that was uninspired. Consider seeing something else. bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, the end"
3,"good movie, but adult only","It was a good movie. Not what I expected it to be by any means. Definetly an adult only movie. Never thought from the small discription of the movie or the trailer that I would have to worry about kids coming through the room wanting to watch it or seeing it, but this is one that they should not see. It would be nice if they would give a better discription of the movies before you rent them."
1,One of the worst movies,"My husband and I rented this movie because we thought it would be a great comedy, normally we love movies with Vince Vaughn; Ben Stiller too. This movie was bad, really bad. Very cheesy. And we had no idea it was an alien movie."
3,Huge actors and the movie seemed so/so,"I like all the characters but the movies just didn't seem too well planned out to me. Each one of these actors can make a movie and hold it up on there own, but that wasn't enough to save this one. I would not rent this ever again."
1,Don't bother,It is really hard to understand why they ever released this. I didn't laugh so I finally gave up-I seriously doubt it got better at the end!
1,Disgusting,"The subject says it all. It's not even average Ben Stiller, it's way worse than that. Don't waste your hard-earned money on this."
3,Funny!,The comic acting is great...especially Vince Vaughn!! The theme of the night watch chasing aliens is a far-fetched though...but still recommend viewing!!
1,DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE,The trailer for this movie looked great so I rented it. I cannot say enough bad things about this movie. It was downright just horrible. There were a couple funny parts at the beginning then it was all down Hill.
3,Good for a few laughs,"Nothing groundbreaking here. Any fan of Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill or Vince Vaughn will be right at home with this one."
1,garbage comedy,"i'm never critical with my movies and pretty open to stupid and silly stuff, but this movie is pretty awful. there are some funny moments, but the dreadfulness of this whole thing is too much for youtube clips worthy scenes to sit through."
2,Not my cup of Tea,I rented this movie from Redbox to watch before buying. Got through the first 5 minutes but then allowed myself to get distracted by several other things and never made it through the movie. I just let it play in the background but didn't pay any attention to it. Probably a good movie for someone else but not a movie I want to buy.
1,Completely stupid!!!!!,This is the worst movie I think I've ever seen. I so completely disapointed with Vince VaughnI not sure I would see any more movies with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn
3,The Watch,The film started off funny but the more it went to the ridiculous the less funny it got. Too bad another movie with great potential was ruined by going absurd.
1,Stupid as posibly it could be...Ben Stiller hits another level of voulgar indolency,Very bed. Very bed. Worse than bed. The worst movie I ever seen. I do not recommend to loose your time and money
1,Vile and full of bad humor,I was very dissappointed with the performance of these actors. It was nothing but curse words and vile humor. Definitely not a family movie.
1,Boring.,"I was pretty disappointed. Each character plays their own stereotype from movies previous. Vaughn, the hug it out let's just party bro. Stiller, the anal retentive control freak. Hill, the slacker who lives at home with mom. etc. It's not super funny, the plot is pretty banal. just meh all around."
1,Wait for it to come to cable.,"It's just bad, what can I say. My wife lives Vince Vaughn ad his rants, but not even him can save this movie.It's as if a bunch of teenagers got together and decided to write a movie about aliens in a neighborhood that is not even funny."
5,GOOD LAUGH,"this is a guys movie, no kids and sensitive wives. Best watched with the guys and a your choice of favorit beverage."
1,Complete waste of time,"Script plays as if there isn't one. Everyone knows the cast, but they're wasted in this film. Anyone with an IQ over 20 won't sit through it."
1,Didn't even finish watching it,"Has very few moments of comedy. I got so bored watching it I stopped after an hour. Was very tempting to sit it out for the $4 rental, but just couldn't"
1,Stupid Profanity Fest,"I was very interested in seeing this movie because it was filmed in my area and it got a lot of publicity during the time they were here filming, not to mention the big names. The story line was stupid and it was one of the worst cases of profanity and sexual nonsense you will hopefully ever see from a major company."
3,It was funny but could have been better,"This movie is a wait till it's free, not worth a rental. It was okay but not to memorable. The story line had a lot of promise but fell short of it's potential."
2,Boring me to death,"left the movie after 30 minutes of boring, found something else to do, husband watched another half hour then turned it off"
4,worth the watch,"While it certainly is no 'the burbs', the watch was actually a fun watch. The cast was great; Jonah Hill was surprisingly good as a wanna be tough guy, rather than the goofy teenager role Ive seen him play in the past. Richard Ayoade is always amazingly hilarious as the flat, geeky, comedian- loved him in the IT crowd and the only down side of this film is that he didn't have more screen time. Vince Vaughn is the typical manic, cocky, guys guy- but he always pulls it off. Ben Stiller plays the average joe manager of a Costco.The guys set out to solve a recent murder of a security guard. What they uncover is an extraterrestrial plot.While I won't be adding it to my video collection, it is worth the rental. Get a few pals over, grab a few brews, and enjoy!"
3,fun to watch,It had it's moments and kind of fun to watch at home. Wouldn't have spent the cost if I was going to the theater to see it.
2,okay movie,"I thought with my favorite star in this movie, it would be much better than it was, maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind when I watched it, I will give it another try!"
2,vulgar,"too many bad words for a comedy and sexual content, funny in parts but quite a few slow parts looking for humor"
3,The Watch,"I thougt this movie was funny, Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn were the best things about it, they play well off each other."
2,The watch,Some parts were funny but overall not a great movie. I expected better comedy with the great cast of awesome comedian actors that were in this movie! Disappointed :(
3,Filthy language!!!!,TOO much F___ and other curse words. It's a real shame movie producers allow such vulgar language. It would be a 5 otherwise.
3,"Crude, inappropriate and funny",You get exactly what you expect here. The action is dumb but there are enough funny moments to make it worth seeing.
3,Usual Ben Stiller type comedy.,Not the best movie but ok as a light comedy to fill up an evening. Your typical Ben Stiller comedy.
3,Laugh material,"If you rent and don't expect too much you won't regret. Cast are allstars and I laughed a lot as did the wife but the story gets a little too uh...out of this world?! Laugh, go ahead."
3,was decent,Was good comedy worth seeing once but not one i would buy to keep at home save some $ and rent
4,funny comedy,This movie is one of ther better comdies that I have seen in quite a long time. The entire cast was awsome. So if you are looking for a good laugh then The Watch is for you.
1,Very lame,The plot was so poor these great actors couldn't pull it off. Dumb movie. Not worth the rental cost. You wouldn't miss it.
3,ONot so funny,It was not as funny as it sound or what I read. Why do I have to enter eight more words.
2,Great comedians but not a great story or script,"I've seen these four in movies and TV shows that have made me laugh till it hurt. Shockingly I did not laugh once at this film. I can't blame the cast because if you see Tropic Thunder, 21 Jump street, The I.T. Crowd Wedding Crashers and then this film you will know what I'm talking about. ""Spoiler"" It is yet another story where aliens come to earth and they are evil monkeys. I wish they did it like 21 Jump Street and made the threat be distracted by the incompetent heroes and then busted. Also the aliens were ridiculous. I feel like someone or some people did not use the talent that was in this film for some odd reason. I thought there was great chemistry between Bed Stiller and Richard Ayoade and I hope they do another film again."
3,just ok,"this movie was kinda dumb. there were some parts that were funny but as a 59 yr old, I ask myself, why did I watch this. I guess I was bored."
2,Boring,Could not get into it . My son did enjoy it alot. But for some reason i did not share the same opinion of him. I do like the cast alot there other movies are what made me check this out.
1,Bad,Looked like it was written and directed by a 14 year old boy.Not even close to Night at the museum or Tropic thunder.
3,Movie Sucked,"Judging from the actors we expected an amazingly funny movie but i'd have to give this a 3 out of 5. This movie has a few surprises in it and had a good ending, just wasn't as funny as we were expecting"
2,was somewhat funny,somewhat funny not very like i thought it would be i didnt even know it was about aliens till i saw it
3,Funny,Ben stiller is at his best in my opinion. Definatley not to be compared to the hangover though! Good setup for sequel
3,Eh,"I wasn't too impressed with this movie. It was one of those movies that had random funny parts and was kind of disconnected in the story line. It didn't seem very well written. More of a ""I feel like laughing film"" than anything."
1,Horrible,Incredibly stupid. Worst 3.99 I have ever spent. Would not recommend to anyone. Terrible. Stupid. Worst movie Ben stiller has made.
1,Too much vulgarity,"Seriously, do you need to throw in an orgy to get people to watch a movie these days?? While there were some funny parts in this movie, I thought it was more stupid than funny."
1,"Dreadful, which is a shame...","Ben Stiller chose sub par material this time out. A few moments of hilarity in the beginning gave way to debase, dregs of the comic bowl afterward. If your idea of funny is a torrent of penis jokes. filthy dialogue and retread of genre movies gone wrong, this is the film for you. I would love my $3.99 back, but alas -- lesson served. So disappointing, when you know it could have been better."
2,Needlessly Crude,"There were some funny and enjoyable lines and scenes, but the whole film was seemingly scuttled by the needlessly crude and base plot elements. I wish I had read reviews before subjecting the my wife and in-laws to this movie."
3,Another Alien Movie,"Unlike most critics, I had no problems with the crude, sophmorish dialogue in The Watch. Anyone who is familiar with Hill or Vaughn's work should've known what to expect. My problems with the movie are (1) it's a 90 minute ad for Costco. Brand placement in film has reached annoying levels (2) The Watch contains mawkish subplots that have no business being in a sci-fi comedy. For example, Vaughn's character is trying to better connect with his daughter, while Stiller has breeding issues with his wife. It's like the miniseries V intersecting with Thirtysomething. Can we have an alien invasion movie where the hero's ONLY focus is on saving the planet? If a guy is tasked with battling an army of intergalactic mutants, his defective man-goop would be the last thing on his mind. I still recommend The Watch though. It's good for a few big laughs. This could've been a very quotable comedy if the writing was a bit wittier."
1,horrible,"Watched it last night, or actually just half of it. I can't believe Ben Stiller and Vince V. actually did this movie. Jonah Hill is another story, but even as a young comedian he should have turned it down immediately. Movies like 'The Watch' ruin careers. Quite honestly, this is probably one of the most pathetic comedies I've seen in a while. I want my 40 mins back!"
2,Not very good.,Hill and Ayoade were completely wasted talents in this movie. Stiller and Vaughn have long since lost their luster. Bummer.
2,Horrible!,"While there were a few laughs and I mean very few, the movie overall wad horrible. Was very disappointed! Don't waste your money."
1,"Awful, don't waste your time with this movie. I couldn't even finish it because it was so bad. I wish I could get my $4 back!!!!","Awful, don't waste your time with this movie. I couldn't even finish it because it was so bad. I wish I could get my $4 back!!!!"
4,Hilarity Ensues!,You'll never look at your neighborhood watch or your local Costco the same way again. Fun way to spend an evening at home. Lots of language and brief nudity so not appropriate for young viewers.
3,Funny only because of Vaughn,"It was ok, due to lack of good characters. Also the funny parts didn't always come of smooth and didn't feel genuine. But still had a few good laughs."
1,"Wow, this is as bad as it gets",This is a perfect example of a movie clip being the only funny part of an entire movie. This was a jumbled mess of nonsense filled with endless streams of unneeded profanity. I highly do NOT recommend this film.
3,Silly but Fun,This is clearly a comedy but an enjoyable one. Okay but fun! The characters represent a variety of different community members but in the end they pull together to help their neighborhood.
1,frustrated,yes I'm frustrated the video was very poor very blurry kept going in and out 2 out of the last 3 videos I rented did this I hope you can improve it but I think I'm done good luck
1,What a dumb movie,"This movie had nothing of value- a real wast of $4, I wouldn't recommend as a funny comedy to anyone."
3,As expected,"It had some funny parts, but on most occasions I was left to the wild imagination of Stiller. They do a good job of developing most of the characters but nothing REALLY deep or just why they make some of those choices. Over all the movie was a good time killer and I don't regret having watched it, but i certainly wouldn't own this or rent it again."
1,I tried to like it,"I really gave this movie a chance, but saying the most disgusting thing you can think of to say isn't funny to me. This movie's sexual humor is way lower than any common denominator that I'm aware of. Filthily worded and highly descriptive sex jokes are constant and if these jokes don't fit your morality or your sense of humor, then there is nothing in this movie for you to enjoy."
5,great,"Great story and funny script. ben Stiller was great as usual, Vince Vaghn ( I never liked) wasnt as annoying as he couldve been and ususally is. the fat guy who lost weight (cant remember his name yet) was great too. very funny!"
1,Hard to Watch,"Hard to watch movie, called ""The Watch"" describes what you will be doing throughout most of this feature length film-Watching your Watch. One wonders how this script was even accepted. Even with the like of Stiller, Vaughn, and Hill (I love these 3 comic geniuses) there really is no point to the film. There is an ongoing subplot with Ben Stiller and his wife (played by Rosemarie DeWitt) not being able to get pregnant (goes nowhere), Jonah Hill is a cop wanna be that lives at home (predicable). You can guess how the story will play out, but the ride should at least be fun. It isn't."
2,wasted my time and money,"only worth watching if you have nothing else to do. I thought it looked better by the preview, but the film fell way short of the teaser trailers and although I kept looking for it to redeem itself, it never happened."
2,Too crude for adults,"I missed the warning label, ""Ruder, cruder and lewder"". Actually, since it was rate R, I thought they were just trying to get people interested, but it wouldn't be as lewd as it really was. It should have been rated XXX. And sadly, there was no need for it. The premise to the story was very funny, and without the constant filthy language and the nudity, as well as frequent sexual innuendo, it would have been a funny movie. I highly recommend that this movie not be purchased by anyone."
3,Not Ben Stiller's best work.,This actually turned out to be a sci-fi type movie which I didn't expect from Ben Stiller. There were some funny scenes and some corny scenes.
1,I Wouldn't Watch the Watch,"We had a guest that wanted to see The Watch so we watched it. Think of 21 Jump Street, Horrible Bosses, the Hangover Movies and it seems like a million others like it. The cheap, gross, nearly humorless movies that are a dime-a-dozen worthless comedies. Now think of the one you thought was the worst of this bunch. My guess is you would think The Watch is worse. It is a pathetic attempt at a movie of any type, let alone humor. I wouldn't watch The Watch."
1,worst movie ever,If I could give this a minus rating I would.There is nothing funny about the f word or any other obscene language.Was there anything funny in this movie? Not as far as I could tell.I am trying to figure out how to get my money back on this one.
4,"Corny-funny, if you're into that","Typical Ben Stiller silly comedy. Made me chuckle a few times, maybe one full blown laugh. My husband and I were entertained. :)"
1,Don't waste your time or money,So disappointing considering some of the best comedians in acting. Not sure how these A players agreed to this horrible film. Rubbish! Don't bother.
3,Who Ya Gonna Call?,"Alien Busters? I suppose it's amazing that it took this long for somebody to straight up copy Aykroyd and Murray. It's a formula that works. There are a couple of good laughs. No character takes himself too seriously (except the eternally uptight straight man Ben Stiller playing a grown up copy of Max Fisher from ""Rushmore"".) A comedy doesn't have to be original as long as it's funny."
3,"Good not great, more than expected","The Watch has its moments and it was funnier than I had expected based on reviews I'd read elsewhere.This movie was missing a bit of the warmth and charm that made Dodgeball so funny. However, this is still worth watching. The acting is all decent throughout with everyone getting at least one good moment. Although, Richard Ayoade (IT Crowd) is the stand out here I think. The setting for the movie feels like a series of set pieces instead of a real place and it makes everything feel artificial. I really want to love it but it just fell short of being really good."
3,funny,"okay . Nothing to get excited about . A lot of bad language, for a comedy . I would not sggest it to"
1,Awful not even worth one star,"I ordered this movie preparing to laugh for 2 hours considering the cast of actors. I was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, baseline childish humor, terrible acting, don't waste your money."
2,the watch,It was ok but not as funny as you would expect from this cast. I wouldn't watch it again. thanks
3,The Watch,"The movie is very funny and it is good Ben Stiller and Vince Vaugh; however, the humour is over the top with sexual content and a lot of people would be offended and not find it funny. Very male humour and very 'adult' content."
2,Really lame film,"Although there were a few chuckles along the way (mostly from Richard Ayoade as Jamarcus), even this cast of funny guys couldn't make it work. The whole thing seemed like it was created from a Chinese menu of movie making criteria (one from column A, two from column B, ...)"
2,Vince Vaughn and aliens don't mesh,"This movie had the occasional laugh but by and large was just a silly and completely outrageous plot. There wasn't much to like about this one. Only die-hard Ben Stiller or Vince Vaughn fans could consider this to be anything better than a 2 star movie. I wanted to like it, but based on the plot, could not."
4,All in all this movie is a bit of Sci-Fi/Comedy Awesome!,"I watched this thinking it was another spoofy comedy with Vince, Ben, and Jonah.It wasn't.It was a bit silly as they created the neighborhood watch, but then the sci-fi part of the film kicked in and WOW I was loving it. As good a movie as I've seen in a while, but very hard to compare with other works. It is more serious than Mars Attacks, Galaxy Quest, or Paul, but not as serious as Pitch Black, Alien, or Predator. If you liked 4 of the six movies I just named then you'll definitely like ""The Watch.""All in all this movie is a bit of Sci-Fi/Comedy Awesome! 4 stars - M.R."
5,Freaking hilarious,"The movie was so hilarious, it was kind of the dumb funny like you would expect from Ben stiller. It was a movie worrth watching."
2,Did not like it,Didn't like it F word every other word..not really funny for the type of cast it had so much potential...ugh!
5,Loved this movie,Saw movie in theaters and loved it. Wanted to buy it for home but couldn't find it. The quality over the internet was flawless.
1,are you even kidding me,"This movie would have been ten thousand times better if it had been about a neighborhood watch and nothing but, trying to catch someone who kept stealing lawn gnomes or whatever. I mean heck, you have a cast of big-name actors here, and they're stuck in a HORRIBLE film. It starts off with promise, but then spins off into sheer ridiculousness when aliens get involved. I mean, the writing and plot were just SO bad. For shame."
3,If you can stick through the first half...,I Rented this movie mostly because I loved Richard Ayoade in The IT Crowd. The movie had promise but I thought the first half was pretty random. The second half of the movie is better but still not enough to make this a great movie. Except for the Sci-Fi angle this movie was much better when it was Hot Fuzz.
2,Ugh,Bad. Really bad. Not good. At al. Seriously so so bad. I'm not kidding. Got it? Really quite bad. And weird.
3,it was ok watchable lol,although i thought vince and ben might have over done it a bit . richard and johnah did fairly good
1,Don't waste your time!!,"Sad that they tried to put as much vulgar language and crude humor into every minute of the movie. Well, at least that is what I saw until I turned it off. Ben Stiller has made some great movies ""Night at the Museum"" and the sequel being the best. Too bad they don't try to make quality movies instead of trash to get a rated R which should be a worse rating than that."
1,This Wasn't that Humoures,"I think I feel alseep. I usually like ben stiller but this one was kind of iffy for me. Not sure I would recommend it. I do however like the actors, it was just too goofy."
1,Don't bother,"Ben Stiller drew me to this movie, i generally enjoy his work. however, he must of needed some extra cash to have sunk this low. It was a poor movie right from the get go. Not worth the effort of clicking the on button."
1,"The second half is okay, but you have to get through the first half...","I almost couldn't watch the first half of this movie. I kept apologizing to my boyfriend for renting it, it was so bad. The characters were really dumb and did not have individual personalities. By the last half hour of the movie, the action was better and the characters improved... or my expectations had been lowered enough by the first half the Ben Stiller narrating the life cycle of a potato would have been okay."
1,One star is too many,"Juvenile, unfunny, poorly acted. What was Vince Vaugn thinking when he decided to do this movie? I'd perhaps expect this from Ben Stiller but not Vaugn. Not one thing was funny"
1,Just plain bad,This was just a bad movie. No other way to out it. Glad I didn't pay full price in the theater to see it.
2,I fell asleep.,"Granted I just had surgery, but this movie really was slow going. Typical Stiller shtick, so if you're into that, you will probably like this. The plot was horrible and I felt like I wasted my time. Vince Vaughn was his typical irreverent self and that was cool and I liked that it took place in a Costco. The plot was weak and the budget seemed nonexistent."
2,stupidly funny but very profane I was hoping for better,The previews present this movie as funny in a goofy slapstick kind of way.In actuality it is filled with unnecessary bathroom and gross sexual humor and relies on shock to provoke more uncomfortable 'nervous' laughter than anything else.Don't fool yourself into thinking you can watch this with your kids.
1,Totally missed,"I was really disappointed, it had such potential to be a funny movie. They missed a great opportunity. They should have playedup being a neighborhood watch better."
1,"If there was a ""0 stars"" option, I would have selected it!",Horrible movie! I can't believe I paid anything to watch this garbage! Please talk me out of future rentals like this so I don't repeat this mistake! Can I get my money back?
1,Mind numbing.,Movie had no fluidity and a weak plot development. It is a movie that tires to be funny but never really is funny. Should have known any movie with Jonah Hill would be a week movie. The development of Ben Stiller 's character was slow. The movie was sadly not entertaining. It jumps around so much that it seems like the other characters story times were vague and worthless to the rest of the story. Not worth watching unless you are extremely bored and wanting something stupid to watch.
1,Sleep Walking,"Sad to see such an astonishing waste of talent for this dud i.e., straight to video quality. It reaches my lamest-comedy list that actors seem to be sleep walking throughout. In other words, one of the un-funniest ""comedies"" I've lost 90 minutes over. Who ever approved this film must not really understand script writing or else be stuck in his/her stunted adolescence."
1,Poor use of good talent!,Could have been a good movie....Childish antics and extreme foul language throughout the entire movie. The language was not needed. All the foul language did was take up time that could have been used for dialogue...a cheap way of taking up time.Strongly recommend not watching this and I am a big Ben Stiller fan!
3,The Watch,"I thought with the stars in this movie it would be funny. However, the laughter was few and far between. I kept watching it hoping it would get funnier. No luck."
1,Graphic Language!,The concept of the movie was cute.... The use of strong graphic language was not necessary! It ruined the movie and I was disappointed that these fabulous characters were developed in that manner! A real dud.
2,A few chuckles is all,"This is a pretty stupid movie, but if you just want to switch off for a couple hours and have a few (literally, just a few) laughs, I wouldn't talk you out of it. Jonah Hill and Vince Vaughn provide the only real comic relief, and most of it looks like improv and outtakes. Utterly forgettable and sure to be found in the $2 bin at Walmart very soon."
3,Kinda funny,"It was ok, not as funny as I had expected with the actors involved. Had some good funny moments but was flat for most of the film. Not bad if you're bored and have nothing else to watch."
4,LMAO!!,this movie was funny! my wife and i seen this through our Wii u great picture and sound. will watch again.
4,Lots of Laughs,"If you want to spend time not overly thinking, this is a great movie. Stiller, Vaughn and Jonah are a riot."
2,trailer makes it look good,Not very funny at all. I thought with all of the big comic names in the movie it would be...
4,Funny for what it was,"I did not go in expecting a cinematic masterpiece and thus I was not disappointed. Not every movie needs to be a sweeping, epic full of social commentary. It was exactly what I expected from this group of actors, if not a bit more."
2,The (End Of The) Watch,"I knew THE WATCH was going to be bad from the get-go. However, the only reason this reviewer wanted to check the film out was to see British actor Richard Ayoade who was so hilarious on the Brit sit-com, THE IT CROWD. His talents are wasted in the film as his character is as stupid as everyone else in the film. The film is another failed attempt to mix paranormal with comedy that hardly works (GHOSTBUSTERS being the exception), and we've seen Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, etc., play variations of these types of characters so many times in other films that they seem to be morphing into each other. Predictable, not fun to watch, terrible script, and characters we don't care about makes THE WATCH just another tax write-off for 20th Century Fox."
4,Entertaining. A little slow at first.,"The movie starts out a little slow, with a lot of time wasted on Ben and Vince trying too hard to be funny. But it is a unique humor. A Will Farrell type humor. You either like it or you don't. The alien approach was cool and the sight gags were funny. A good movie, slightly crude, but worth the time."
2,Meh...,"I feel after watching this and laughing maybe 20 times at most, that they tried to use the wrong actors for the script. Stiller and Vaughn are funny guys, but not in the roles they were cast. Hill and the tall man, were good, but i left feeling with two other main actors and a more jovial style to the movie, it would have been a lot funnier and a lot more interesting. It was hard to care for most of the characters, because there was little in way of development.Special effects were pretty good, music was well done, and the cinematography were all fine. As a movie it works. As a comedy the plot is weird, but strangely they play it too serious throughout the movie. A different tone for the movie would have gone a long way to salvaging it. As it was, don't waste your time."
4,"An intentionally silly, low-brow sci-fi action-comedy that works well for a lonely or boring night-in","""Mixing OSU Buckeye iconography, Richard Ayoade, Rosemarie DeWitt, and tigers all in the same film makes everything better, and much more surreal, than any comedy I've witnessed lately. In retrospect, it is much more of a success than Men in Black 3 could ever have been but it still suffers from a incoherent script with too many sidetracks toward crude sex jokes than actual storyline focused on an alien disaster but in many ways, it's more interesting that way just like what Paul (2011) with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost done the same thing to the sci-fi genre and Hot Fuzz done to the hard-to-the-knuckles action film genre. Let alone, the quirky positives weigh against the potential negatives in this bizarre mix-and-mash."""
3,Thought it would be better,This is kind of a dumb movie but has some funny parts so i gave it 3 stars. With the cast in this movie i expected it to be funnier.
1,The Watch,Don't waste your money. Big stars must need money. Expect this kind of movie from unknown kids. I should get my money back and get paid for my time watching it.
4,Funny Movie!,"I thought this movie would be terrible, based on the premise of the alien thing- but it was soooo funny!"
5,A super fun movie,"I wasn't expecting much from this one and was super pleasantly surprised! I laughed a ton, cheered at the end, pretty much everything I could ask for in a comedy. Loved it!"
2,Not worth your time.,"Vince Vaughn is the only reason this movie should be watched. Some good one liners, but after it was over I wished I had ordered something else."
3,Not Bad,As good as I thought it would be. Definitely some funny scenes and i don't regret buying it but not one of those movies that you will watch again or talk about to your friends and quote from.
2,"Funny guys, but unnecessarily vulgar","Could have been much better, but had a few laugh out loud moments. I hope they do not do a sequel."
3,Acceptable,"This movie is sort of a sequel to the movie The Burbs. Although it is funny in parts and entertaining in other parts, all in all it's an okay movie that doesn't require a lot of thought to follow."
3,Pass the Time,"I wanted this movie to be a little more, but it was just too ""short"". I believe the story was creative enough to pass, the Humor, of course is what gets this movie to 3 stars. The rest is a blow over.I did enjoy the creative casting and the design of the ""Enemy characters"". Also, whenever you get to see the boys get a laser-that-explodes-anything and drink some beer and have a good time, it's fun to watch."
2,It was ok,Not the funniest movie we've watched but what can ya ask for with this cast and crew... They've gone down hill
2,Disappointed,Just not worth the price of rental fee or your time.I really like the cast and had reasonable expectations but this is simply stupid
2,Kinda what you expect,"It's a Ben Stiller flick, which should be your first clue as to what you are getting. I think they spent a ton of money on effects. It wasn't the worst movie I have seen, I would put it a little below average, Dnot take the flick too seriously and you might enjoy it."
1,Rooting for the Aliens,"The movie trailers almost always make movies look so much better than they really are. This movie is no exception. Bait and switch. The cast was great, too bad that they had such a poorly written script to work from. With all the countless writers selling their wares in Hollyweird, and this is the best script you could come up with? It's almost as if the script was an afterthought. As a consolation prize they even threw in a little porn, so parents take note.Stiller, Ayoade and Vauhgn: What were you thinking?It took me two days to watch this because I fell asleep midway through the movie. And actually had to replay the very end again."
1,Unfortunate from the Beginning...,"Even if the tragic killing by the ""neighborhood watch"" guy haden't happened this movie would have been less than a Ben Stiller movie should have been. When the awful news of the absolutely aweful tragic new was going on, why didn't the producers CAN this movie? Geez, can MONEY be so important to simply change the title of the movie and still releace it! The brain-duds who still chose to truncate it from ""Neighborhood Watch"" to ""The Watch"" AND still choose to still release it... Well I am glad you lost your investment. Sadly, you had the smarts before you made your DUH decisions. You must have been banking on investment insurance. BTW, the movie had potential but was corrupted with stupidity, way too many f-bombs, a possible story line that was wasted with short sightedness and greed... What a waste of good talente..."
2,The watch,Ok movie. Kind of a stupid plot. Good cast and there were some funny parts in the movie. It was ok.
4,Funny,"As long as you go in expecting an off the wall comedy, you won't be disappointed. Loved it and would watch it again!"
2,"Bad, just BAD","Im a huge fan of Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill...so putting them together, I thought great idea ,should be a great film. WRONG! This movie was just bad. No other word than that. The plot was rather cliche, the acting wasn't even that good - and that is something you wouldnt expect from seasoned actors. I wasted my money. I spent 3.99 on the instant watch and i seriously wish I would have my money back!"
1,"The build up: great actors, the result: worst movie ever","I will sum this up short so as to not waste more of anyone's time. Aliens and sex orgies, really. I mean really."
1,"sorry, but this movie sucks.","its true, this movie sucks. i wanted it to be good, but it wasnt. it was pretty bad. not even tongue-in-cheek funny or stupid but good funny. disappointed cuz i really like these actors. i want my money back."
2,Pretty Weak...,"Didn't really enjoy this much, a couple of funny one liners was about it...This was pretty weak around alien interactions, except for the ending"
2,Nope,Didn't care for it. Probably wouldn't care to watch it again. Really didn't care for the orgy scene an dif I had read the parental reviews prior to renting I wouldn't have.
2,Not Great,"Its ok but not a great movie, I have def seen better movies with stiller in them. Some funny parts"
3,Alright,"There's very few ben stiller movies that I'm a big fan of, which might have altered my decision about this movie. It was alright, just not as funny as I expected it to be... Disappointing."
2,It's ok,This is one of those movies that you are glad that you didn't buy it. It had some funny one liners but that is about it. Not really for me.
1,Horrible,I normally love Ben Stiller movies. This one was painful to watch and Vince Vaugh did nothing to help it.
2,the watch,"The cast is a funny group, but the language as vulgar as it was took away from the possibility of continuing to watch it. Stopped movie about 35-45 minutes in. If I was solo I may have continued, but with my wife it was too much."
1,Feel asleep,This was a pretty bad movie and plot. I was expecting it to be better especially with the cast. Save your money on this one.
5,Funny,Funny crazy movie!Ben Stiller is always funny and I think it's a pretty funny moive. I give it a 5 star rating.
4,Funny!!,Lots of laughs and good characters. Was just the ticket for serious times. Nice to see a good comedy with real comedians!
3,O.K.,"Not totally my cup of tea. It's funny, yet cheesy and crude. But I suppose it could be a good one-time watch for some."
2,More swearing than conversation,"If you want to hear the ""f"" bomb 1,000 times, this is the movie for you. If not, I wouldn't waste your time. The audience for this type of movie is not adults only. Had the potential to be funny but wasn't."
2,Uggh,Not particularly funny but pretty stupid. Concept of buddy movie using high powered stars was good but execution and using aliens really poor.
1,horrible movie,do not waste your money renting this movie. It was not funny. It was very boring and no real story line.
1,Stupid Movie.,Stupid Movie. Stupid Movie. Stupid Movie. Stupid Movie. Stupid Movie. Stupid Movie. Stupid Movie. Not enough Beer to make this movie good.
2,"Predictable, not that funny","Stiller and Vaughn can both be really great (I loved Starsky and Hutch and Wedding Crashers) but this film did not do it for me - the plot became very predictable and I never found the humor very funny. If not for all the gratuitous cussing it would be just another PG 13 throw away. Hardcore fans of these actors may enjoy it, or younger viewers with a low bar line."
3,The Watch,"Vince Vaughn was good in this movie as was Ben Stiller. The trailer made me laugh out loud, and although there were a few funny parts in the movie, basically it was just stupid."
2,Eh....,Nothing new here.....You'd think with this cast this would be walk away laughing - but writing sub par - if you really want it waittill it shows up in the 5$ dollar bin at Wal Mart....
3,FUNNY BUT SHOULD BE RATED X FOR LANGUAGE,"I would have really liked this had it not been for the filthy language...younger people won't mind the language which is sad to me, this is uncalled for to use this verbage in any movie, these actors are so funny without it and to me it takes away from the movie...even though I hated the filthy language it still had it's funny moments"
3,Not too bad!,It has some funny moments....tha's all I can say. Sometimes it seems like they try too hard to be funny.
4,Pretty good,Not bad movie. But they just don't make scary movies like they use to. Simple and easy to buy and stream to my tv. Laptop or iPad through amazon instant video.Story line was interesting and kept my attention to see what happens be next. But the ending was not what expected at all. I thought it was just a comedy but tuned in to syfy
2,"Dumb, dumber and dumbest...",Not a typical Ben Stiller movie. Dumb plot and the orgy part was not necessary nor funny. Don't waste $0.99 on this bomb.
3,Not their best work,usually this would be considered a comic powerhouse with the stars involved but weak writing seemed to be the biggest drawback
2,swing and miss,"Great cast, some really superb lines and situations, but the overall plot and execution falls short. Not bad for those lazy days with nothing on and you happen to catch it on cable."
1,"Ridiculous, juvenile, and a waste of time",The title of my review says it all. The only thought to add is my disappointment that Ben Stiller chose to appear in this dreadful movie. I admire Mr. Stiller and think he is a terrific actor. He deserves so much better than this awful mess.
4,Nerdy funny,It's not my kind of movie for the rude crude methods. But it was ok. I did laugh at it. And it was a good ending.
1,"Wow, not funny AT ALL!!! Sooo bad it's stupid!!!",It's like they took aged decade ago semi-funny script and tried to apply it to gray haired wrinkly Stiller and Vaughn -- absolutely horrible and clearly they knew it was crap they'd just make money from. NO VALUE WHATSOEVER!!! YOU WILL LITERALLY BE ANGRY YOU PAID FOR IT!!! A HUGE LIE!!!
3,WATCH THAT LANGUAGE!,"We rented this movie because of the cast. What is not to like about this group? But the language was very rough and my feelings is that it could have been just as funny without most of that language. Also, the story is a little lame. Not what we thought when we rented it. But hey, we did watch it."
2,overrated,"Most of the punch lines were in the trailer, gratuitous language and crass sophmoric humor stemming from a lack of comedic creativity"
1,Not funny,"I like the actors in the film but not the film. It was not funny, we stopped watching it after an agonizing 45 minutes."
1,Not good,"We turned this ovie off. Horrible. Too much cussing and sexual innuendoes. Would not recommend to anyone, except don't watch it."
2,Not a Comedy!,"If you are looking for a comedy, this is not the movie for you. Definitely not the movie we were expecting based on who was in it."
2,Don't Bother,"If you are truly dying to see a Ben Stiller movie than go for it. However, if you would rather save your money on renting this at $3.99 just remember that every penny counts and this is one movie you should by pass."
3,Not what I expected,"This movie is ok funny, but definately not what I expected. The alien storyline is a little childish. VInce Vaugn and Jonah Hill steal the show."
2,"Some good ideas, but made for a teenage boy","Such Bad Language!! Lots of adolescent type male member talk and jokes - plus an orgy scene with nearly full female nudity and very sexual male stuff. In my opinion - too bad. It's remarkable how they limit their audience by doing this sort of stuff.Some good story ideas, but not a lot of laughs. A lot of chasing and shooting and sex talk and beer drinking and shooting and chasing and bad language. It does have an R rating, but like I said, not really date night stuff. But if you are male and still have an adolescent fascination with bodily functions and fluids and like to play violent video games - you just might enjoy this one!I'm sorry I spent $3.99 to rent it."
4,funny,fast flowing funny.... Vince vaugh was excellent.... good story line ... would like to see it againgood directing.... thanks
1,Not funny....,We wanted a comedy....even silly slap-stick would have been okay....this wasn't it. Mostly just foul language - for those that care.
3,poor story line,"Loved the cast of this movie, but the story line was very poor. It was very funny, but ultimately displeased with purchase."
1,Awful. Don't even consider it.,"Awful story, constant yapping for laughs, poor non-existent story and in the end resorts to cheap sexual acts to generate [unsuccessfully] humorous reaction. Very moronic."
4,Good Movie,The reviews I've seen are terrible for this movie. But I liked it. Classic Ben Stiller & Vince Vaughn humor.
1,Down The Toilet Goes Stiller!,"Ben Stiller is falling in Adam Sandler's footsteps, he just keeps on making crappy movies one after another. This movie had potential but stood among the worst. Not funny and not watchable. Great cast led to waste an Stiller just keeps on doing the same persona over and over, becoming repetitive. Stay Away from this movie and from Stiller."
2,Don't Watch The Watch,"This movie was disappointing considering the caliber of stars in it. As with all movies, I imagine it would have been better if they had replaced Ben Stiller with someone who is actually funny. The dry wit of Richard Ayoade, Vince Vaughn, and Stiller culminate in in stagnant, un-clever quips that leave you just begging for an alien to eat them all. I also wished Jonah Hill would magically gain about 60 pounds so he would be a hysterical fat guy again. Trust me - don't watch this flick. Watch it for free when it comes on Comedy Central."
1,Awful,Its a Big name cast. But its also a terrible movie. There is basically no story. Dont waste your time on this one.
1,Stupid,"Stupid, dumb, bathroom humor,only low IQ people lower need to watch, no story line, do not wast you money or time"
1,streaming issues,"the movie was funny--however, the quality was poor. the streaming was awful, it kept freezing and audio was in sync with the visual. I had to restart/reset the movie 3 times.I give it a low rating because of the streaming issues----the movie would be a 4.5 star"
1,very frustrated !!!!!!,Movie was constantly freezing up never saw the ending!!!!!! So this movie was very hard to watch and not worth paying for! streaming was really bad on this!!!!
1,Couldn't watch it,I would like to review this movie but we got 16 minutes in and the movie kept screwing up. I spent 5 dollars on a movie that wouldn't play right and it's happened so many times now that I'm really doubting ill use amazon instant anymore.
2,"Don't Watch ""The Watch""","This movie was a huge disappointment. If you watch the trailers, you've seen the movie. The humor in scenes is minimal and through unnecessary repetition the little humor get ground out of each scene. a lot of ""in your face"" sexual comments throughout the script."
3,So-so,"Expected a funnier movie with this line-up of actors. It was enjoyable though. We downloaded it at the airport with hopes of watching it on the flight, but the download speed was terrible and were not able to watch it until we could find a decent wi-fi connection with faster download speed."
3,Waste,"I turned it off about a quarter the way through the movie was not worth watching, oh well you win some you lose some"
3,Was Okay Movie,"Thought the movie would be funny, but it wasn't. The video quality was good very good though better than Netflix"
3,Not used to see Ben & Vince do this type of commedy,I liked the movie but its different type of comedy I'm used to coming from these two actors. This movie is about space aliens trying to takeover our planet? Science fiction? The movie has plenty of good comedy but I wasn't expecting mixing science fiction with comedy especially having Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn in the movie.
4,Funny Cast & Movie,"This movie made me laugh. The cast of characters made the silly storyline work for me. They were hilarious! Not the best comedy ever, but worth a watch."
1,Its a turd,"What else do you need ? Oh apparently I cant just say that because I need at least 14 more words to publish this. Okay, I have my quota."
2,That'll Be The Day,"I found it to be quite boring. As far as it being related to John Lennon's life as a young man I see no resemblence other than the fact that his father left. After that fact there are no similarities. I had seen the movie years ago when it first came out. I didn't remeber it, so I purchased it to watch it again. Now I know why I didn't remember it, there was nothing memerable about it."
4,You won't feel ripped off with this DVD,"I've purchased A LOT of kettlebell, crossfit, and other workout dvd's. Diluglio's instruction and workouts are by far the best.You purchase ONE dvd and it features complete information (no ploys to make you buy other dvd's for ""missing"" valuable information or to get you to pay him more money).Upon doing one of his DVD's you'll WANT to buy his others. I just wish some weren't so expensive (which is why I give 4 stars).Very well made and PROFESSIONALLY PRODUCED (not filmed in his living room with crappy sound quality...those of you that do this should be ashamed of yourselves for the amount of money you charge...at least make SOME effort).I look forward to more from him!!!"
2,Almost total lack of instruction,"I have quite a few kettlebell DVDs and I was looking for a little something to spice up my workouts. This DVD was not it.There is virtually no instruction provided and let's say the instructor will not win a prize for being personable. A timer is provided and that's probably the best thing I can say for this DVD. If all you are looking for is watch some guy doing a kettlebell routine in an outdoor setting (I not sure, the background does look kind of fake), then this is the workout for you. I could have gotten more from going to my local gym and watching people doing their kettlebell routines. The Iron Core series and the Skogg System are far superior in my opinion. And yes, I am definitely returning this DVD!"
3,I have mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. I work with people that are mentally ill and to me, this is not an accurate portral of schizophrenia or people that are mentally ill. This movie did bother me in that aspect. If you want to see a movie that is more of an accurate portral of schizophrenia, see ""A Beautiful Mind"". Other wise, the movie did come across as a good movie. The movie watchers didn't really know what was reality and what was fantasy. It did keep me guessing until the end of the movie."
3,HUH????,"hey, Lord knows nobody loves Ralph Fiennes more than me, and his acting in this movie was great. But what the heck was w/ all the flashbacks? I was seriously lost. One minute he's in a bar the next he's in a field...??????The only part i really liked was the part where the nasty woman who runs the half house is frisking Spider for her keys and she can't find them, so she gets all mad & leaves and the keys are in the door. (ironic humor)"
2,Predictable,let me just say briefly that this would be a good film for those who haven't yet seen a large number of films . But I have seen lots of films and I read this from the start.This was a predictable film and rather slow but not an entirely bad film.
2,Took a lot of work to make it through this film.,"I had to watch this movie in two sittings, and almost fell asleep again the second time. It was incredibly twisted, and I didn't care about the characters. The performances are all good, and the actors are well known. I've enjoyed Miranda Richardson in everything I've seen her. It was nice to see Lynn Redgrave again, and I've always liked Gabriel Byrne. It took such a long time to figure out what was going on, and then the final ""revelation"" seemed to fall flat. Try explaining this movie to someone."
1,misfire,This is an incredibly tedious film from the usually excellent David Cronenberg. It takes a huge amount of patience to sit through the seemingly interminable 93 minutes. That said though I will give it one more go just to make sure before I consign this disc to the trash.
1,"didn't understand it, and didn't care",This slow movie tried to confuse us the same way that Spider was confused. I didn't care enough about the film to try and figure out what really happened. I'm just glad it's over.
3,Good Book,"This book is next only to ""From Neuron to Brain"" to understand Neuroscience Basics. It covers a bunch of other topics other than Neuroscience. Worth a reading!"
3,The illustrations make this book,"Boy lead character, ok for younger readers, still exciting for middle grades. Axel keeps his head in a crisis.Jean Craighead George does a good job with the science of wildfires and shows the regenerative nature of forest fires. Without the illustrations, there is not much story here."
4,Amazing book-- absolutely terrible title!,"This is an amazing book and I talk about it all the time--- its often very relevant to visiting different places in the US (I live in the west) but this is a terrible title and it drives me bonker as I can never remember the title when talking about it, recommending it, or even looking for it to purchase as a gift.I am in the publishing industry so I'm hoping the author will not make this mistake again-- title has zero relevance to the subject and has no meaning in itself.The book is wonderful however, full of both broad spectrum of the history, as well as very personal stories of regular people that really bring the era to life."
2,The good credit goes to...,"The good credit goes to the manufacturer of the valve, during the month or more it took to get this product I accidently ordered more not knowing if I had ordered any at all. Yes thats my memory for you, but usually plumbing parts is something a person wants now not later. So Warning, Warning, Warning !!! If you can wait fine you'll get them eventually."
2,a lot of rambling...,"This book is definately mostly about the authors trials and tribulations. It reads kind of awkwardly and clumsy. I didn't feel that I got to know more about what ""actually"" went on in the Waco compound on a daily basis. Frankly, it seems to be alot of adolecent ""whining"" about how hard life is and how much easier it gets when you have a ""leader"" who makes decisions for you."
5,a survivors story-----library book,"American Pie----THIS COULD BE THE DAY I DIE -- the song plays over and over inThibodeaus head.DAVID THIBODEAU (Maine)--a drummer and Branch D member. One ofthe core group that sayed inside Mt. Carmel with David Koresh and hisfamily.Thibodeau wonders will the Federal government allow this atrocity tocontinue.

3,Waco Was A Disaster,"Although I beleive Reno was doing what she thought was right and I'm not antigovenment, I do beleive we should not have gotten envolved."
4,Thought-provoking; makes me want to read more,"I am always interested in why people do the things they do, and this book answers the question of why someone like David Thibodeau became part of the Mount Carmel community. I think the author tries very hard to be unbiased. I didn't understand everything Koresh taught, but I think it's important to read about all sides of the Waco story. I think the author accomplishes his stated purpose of trying to make the world understand that this was not about a bunch of wackos, but about real people with real spiritual needs under the leadership of a flawed man."
5,A 'Must read' if you love America but hate what's happening,Mr. Thibodeau has written a historic document in this book. He managed to stop the natural urge to preach. This book would never once have interested me but now I realize we are all guilty if we remain apathetic. Well done Mr.Thibodeau! Let's get proactive before WE lose OUR freedoms too! THANK-YOU David!
5,Concise Overview,This is the clearest book I've read on WW2 ever. Period. Absolutely absent is the author ego and non-historical hype so prevalent in the field today. Absent also is the strange Cold War hangover which takes the credit for defeating Germany away from the Soviets and makes it seem WW2 was won on the shores of northern France. The facts which become clear to an impartial student of WW2 are presented perfectly in this work: the Soviets bore the brunt of the land war in WW2 and the main contribution of the Western Allies was their destruction of the Luftwaffe and their strategic bombing campaign. The overwhelming scale of the war on the Eastern Front and its horrible consequences are sketched out clearly with both words and pictures. This book was a pleasant surprise.
4,Well arranged view over Ostfront.,"This book is a well arranged view over war in the east 1941-45, a recommended reading for those who are interested in the subject, but I could find some mistakes , for example, Gen. Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach was not the commander in the Demyansk pocket,who led the breakout, he was the commander of the relief force."
1,Ehhh....,"As of this writing I've only listened to the CD part of the way through, then I took it out. I'm a huge fan of the gathering and I've loved everything they've done, except this CD. Anneke didn't even sound like she used to, it almost sounds like a different person. I did only listen to part of this CD once, but it was so bad I had to take it out. It kind of pains me to type that, but that's how bad it is. The old stuff is great, if you plan on getting into this band check out the older stuff."
4,Always a Surprise,"..it always takes a few listens to appreciate the newest releases, from The Gathering..I think the reason they receive such mixed reviews, stems from expectations, that The Gathering's formula will never deviate, from their previous releases.I enjoyed Souvenirs, as I am sure I will enjoy all future Gathering releases."
4,Cranberries meets October Project,"If you are told that this Dutch band's original sound was that of a symphonic metal band, you wouldn't believe it. Simply, because this album is a good way away from that type of music. From the opening song you are hypnotized by the beauty of the singer's voice, one that brings to memory that of Dolores O'Riordan from The Cranberries (click on the sample of ""You Learn About It"" so you can listen for yourself). As for their sound, think October Project or the calm songs of Porcupine Tree and you are almost there. These guys have put together an album that is bound to be enjoyed equally by fans of more experimental and ambient works as well as the public coming from the prog rock side. The only thing (which is why they are not getting a five-star review): after a few songs, the sound starts to repeat itself, but it's a great discovery, one of the best in a while."
5,Probably their best yet,"The Gathering is just the type of band that has never disappointed me. Ever since Anneke joined the band, each of their releases have just gotten better and better. And with Souviners the trend contiunues.Souviners continues in the direction the band started with ""How to Measure a Planet"", longer, sprawling, atmospheric, dark ""rock"" songs that grip at your emotions. Anneke has never sounded more beautiful, and the rest of the band has written some of their most inspired music to date. Broken Glass, You Learn About It, and A Life All Mine (feating Ulver and former Arcturus frontman Trickster G) are just simply amazing songs.If you're looking for something that sounds like Mandylion, look toward Lacuna Coil. If you're looking for something that pushes boundaries and is original, You'll love Souviners."
3,Common Knowledge,"I have an earlier version of this book, and while I like it and consult it from time to time, I'm always a bit disappointed in that the recommendations seem like common knowledge. Some don't, but most do."
2,Not so impressed,Most things were common sense. I am not impressed at all. Guess my expectations were too high.Sorry I can't recommend this one.
2,Average And Over-Simplistic,"Advice like don't stand in a drafty room with wet hair, to avoid catching colds, is.... does not offer much insight and is a bit to common-sense. Most of us would be able to think of these treatments, without the help of a large book. I will not allow publishers to get away, throwing such trash at us, and I will try to return the book to Rajenra Publishing House Ltd, where I had purchased it in India. They sent me half a kg of brochures on the book and happily I threw them into a waste paper basket. Again, a bit to simplistic for my tastes and knowlegde. Yusuf"
3,The Doctor's Book of Home Remedies; Thousands of Tips & Techniques ..........,"I bought this ONE as well as another Home remedies book, this one is okay but not what I was looking for. This book is JUST A LOT OF COMMON SENSE WRITTEN DOWN FROM DOCTORS. I really did not see any remedies in it, not like THE READER'S DIGEST Home Remedies."
4,It has been useful,It has been useful at times. It seems pretty good. Some stuff I wouldn't use for example use of petroleum products. We don't need to use it much.
4,"If you want a useful book, this is it!","This isn't one of those books that use esoteric herbs and strange cures that may or may not work. This book is full of advice by real doctors, meaning the advice is based on medical knowledge, not lore passed down from generations before.It's also full of useful information on everyday problems ranging from stiff necks to insomnia. I'm very glad I got it!"
4,Book filled with interesting and useful information,"Purchased as a used book, but just like brand new. Contents better than expected.I would purchase from this seller again. Delivered execellent merchandise as advertised and very prompt in sending the order."
1,"saller said book was new,but its clearly old!","SALLER NOTES ARE BOOK IS NEW,BUT THE BOOK IS CLEALLY OLD!NOT HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY AND CONDITION OF THE BOOK!"
5,Doctors Book of Home Remedies,This product was on a wish list for Christmas. Must be good if they picked it!
2,No so home-remedy,"Most of the remedies that are in this book are for products that you have to buy over the counter. It's has very little to do with herbal remedies. Its pretty much what your mother or doctor would tell you to do. For example, remedies for acne include: wash your face, don't pick at whiteheads, change your makeup and wear less makeup, use over the counter medicine with benzoyl peroxide, moisturize dry skin, don't get sunburned, and don't overuse over the counter acne medicine. It says on the cover ""self-care solutions"" that usually means common sense stuff, over-the-counter, but not herbal medicine."
2,doc book of home remedies,gives no info that the average person doesn't already know ! I learned nothing from it therefore I returned it.
3,The Doctor's Book of Home Remedies,This is a handy book for home remedies. Good reference source to have one in the book shelf. Amazon has a very good price on this. Thanks.
4,Tailor them,"Bamboo as a writing material is millennia-old. You should tailor them to fit your hand. A sharp, flat blade will do. Don't forget to work on the top side of the nib so that you have a nice edge and better flow of ink. I use soot-based ink."
3,Heavy Metal?,"Looking BackFirst off, I have been a fan of Ian Thomas since the days of his first band ""Tranquility Base."" His body of work allows us to hear and visualize the steady progress he has made as a writer, performer and producer. The Boomers music is a natural continuation of that work (as of this writing his latest CD called ""Little Dreams"" ups the notch again). The ""editorial reviewer"" must have been having a ""Metallica Moment"" and should be allowed to ""have a mulligan."" The term ""heavy metal"" has been used to describe music from ""Iron Butterfly"" and ""Steppenwolf,"" all the way through to ""The Headstones"" et al. Nowhere on that list would you find the music of ""Ian Thomas"" or ""The Boomers."" Although I think he did use a distorted guitar in one song........."
1,review,"Unless the author will provide the m files , the book is of very little use. To what avail to see the results if you do not know the solution?I do not recommend the book!!!"
1,Very bad book,"This is not a book. It is a manual for the code the author has writen.The code is in .p format, not in .m format. So it doesn not let to learn anything.A very bad book. It is just a software manual"
2,"Good Idea, but poorly executed","When I received my book, I was surprised by how thin the book was. Upon initially flipping through the book, I was also disappointed with the overall craftsmanship of the book itself. There are sentences without periods, odd spacing and tabs as if the author was a novice to whatever wordprocessing program he used. The author obviously produced this book without any professional publishing companies, and it shows. This book would do well as an independent project, but not sold as a book on Amazon for over $20. If you don't mind such things, then I would suggest buying this book used. It's not worth the brand new price."
3,Good fun but forgettable.,"Color me jaded but I was not blown away with these photos. The idea is a lot of fun (getting women to flash the camera) and we should all be so lucky. Most of his subjest looks like they have done this sort of thing before. Most of the photos look too posed and wooden. Also, they go topless in France at the beach. Heck, look at the French franc note. There's a nice pair and it's legal tender. In short, Franch women don't have the same hang up about boobies that we do. This isn't a huge strech for them."
1,this book sucks,I thought this book degrades the status of women. I hated seeing them revealing all their feminine assests. uh!
1,Watch out for products like these...,"This was my first digital camera and the quality of the pictures were OK. But everything else about it was a surprise... The batteries burn out extremely fast, just after taking 9 or 10 pictures or playing a song for 3 minutes. The video playback was choppy on the LCD screen and wouldn't even play on my PC. The audio was really hard to hear out of headphones, and so on... In my opinion, this camera is OK just for taking occasional pictures of stuff, but it's a really cheap camcorder and MP3 player. This product was completely unsatifactory to me, so I had to return it. I wouldn't buy it if I were you..."
2,it's all about the battery life,"it really sucks them dry quickly. if you're going to buy a cheap camera and have to spend 3 or four bucks every time you want to use it for more than 5 minutes, well, not so cheap! The A/V quality is so-so, but that's not such a big deal, it actually makes for an interesting ""artsy"" effect. But really, I need to find one that has better battery life, or invest in some rechargeables!"
1,worst thing I've bought,I purchased this a christmas present for myself so I could video tape my children opening gifts. I could not get it to load up completely when I pressed the on button. The screen kept sticking. I finally got it to take 3 pictures but could not view them. It's not that complicated to work but I personally believe it had prior damage possibly from water. I have tried to contact the seller to return it and they swear they only used it once and it worked great for them but.. however it does not work properly at all!! I wish I hadn't purchased it.
4,I suggest it...,"I found this an enjoyable read, though some chapters are especially long-winded...this is to be expected though. The information was solid, though I confess I skipped the text boxes dealing with exegesis as they were a distraction when reading exclusively for content. However, the exegesis information is worth a second look when one is less preoccupied."
4,Great reference,"This is a great book for looking in the background of the writer of each book of the New Testament. It gives more that just the other's opinion, it discusses the opinion of other authors and shows what the possible interpretation and intent of the writer."
4,The Story of the WNBA's Inaugural Season,"This video really showed me what it was like to be in the WNBA's first season. When the lost won the games, i felt all the emotions that the players felt. I liked how the video talked about each team and how they did/or could not overcome their struggles in the first year. I liked how it was chronologically sequenced from the start of the season to the championship games. It had conversations inside the locker rooms with the coachs, and court-side time-outs. I thought this was really neat. This is a good video for anyone new to the WNBA."
3,Good Product overall,I have recently purchased this product. It is overall good but still I have to mention some pros and cons.PROS1. Value for the price.2. You can practice the hits in both kind of surfaces at the same time.3. It has the rubber mat at the bottom has decent friction. If you hit hard on the mat it may move.CONS1. I feel it is very small in size. If you are hitting little long before the ball you may be hitting the surface of the ground. Unfortunately I am practicing in my garage has the hard surface. So I have to hit very carefully.2. Higher part of the turf is coming out quickly. If the turf is struck between your ball and the club head then it more chance of coming out. With in 10 of using this product i see the my divot on the turf.
2,Not Durable,"After about a 2 months of sporadic use, my mat simply tore at a seam. This caused it to fall apart and become trash. I imagine if you strike the mat with a proper stroke, it will be fine, but if you are working on fixing your swing, then this is probably not for you. I, like many golfers tend to come over the top with my swing, this caused me to hit the mat where it attaches at the synthetic grass and the base molding. The grass is threaded into another layer which is glued into place on top of the base. Eventually this second layer separated from the base and the ""grass"" separated completely. Cheap glue = not a well made product."
4,Good turf.,"This is a very good product, the only thing I don't like is that it should be a little bigger like 2'x 3'. thats my only beef with this product. It's still ok though."
4,Convenient,"Got this chair for the beach. It is compact and convenient for portability. I'd buy it again, but here are some considerations:If you are obese or just large, greater than 40 waist for a man or size 12 for a woman, this is not for you. The seat is narrow and lacks arm rests, so getting up could be a challenge.The back of the chair is lower than the front. It is great for sitting on inclines, but flat beach not so much. You need to build up the back, and it is likely best to keep the towel on it so you don't get sand in your trunks.Overall the chair is light and convenient. It is nice, but having armrests would be nice."
1,Dude I should have gotten a Dell.,I have had nothing but problems since I bought it in April. It constantly freezes up. Sporadic no hard drive found errors. Have reimaged dozens of times. Replaced hard drive and motherboard. Tech support is a joke. Mostly offshore parrots reading from a script who cannot understand American Dialect of English.Just a big LEMON.
3,Henk's review on Abel's proof,The actual proof of Abel is in the appendix at the end of the book and the book outlines a history on the life of the mathematicians that worked on the problem. So the book is in fact a history book instead of a realmathematics book. Therefore I was a little bit disappointed because there is little explanation on the actual proof.
2,A Bit Disappointing,"George Gissing certainly composes his thoughts in beautiful poetic prose. His style of writing is delightful and descriptive; however, it was difficult for me to get past his obvious prejudice for the Calabrese. He comes across as an arrogant and pampered Englishman with no interest in southern Italy whatsoever except for its ancient Greek ruins. If I had not been in Calabria at the time I was reading this book I would not have finished it. His relentless whining of the people and conditions is tiresome and his description of southern Italian food is questionable considering the delectable ancient recipes of the area. He even comments about his constant complaining at one point, yet makes little effort to be more optimistic. By the Ionian Sea was written over a hundred years ago and is considered a literary piece, but I would not recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about southern Italy or the Calabrian people."
5,A Smoother Pebble,This was a very interesting book. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in math.
4,Wrong item ordered,"Looks like a reliable product, unfortunately I thought I was ordering one with a remote read-out. My mistake in ordering this product"
2,Disappointing,"It's been a while since I read this, and this is just my opinion, but I was disappointed with this one. I'd read the 1990, 1991, and 1992 editions previously, and I thoroughly enjoyed them."
4,Ammonia clear works,"Worked like a charm. I have a saltwater aquarium. I took out a quart of water from the aquarium, dropped one tab per 10 gallons (I have a 30 gallon tank = 3 tabs), let the tabs completely dissolve. Then I added the water back into the tank. The next day I tested zero for ammonia."
5,It Works!,This product is a bit more expensive per dose than its peers but I think that it works better. If you want to get rid of your ammonia fast then this is the product that you want. Just remember that this is a temporary fix to ammonia buildup.
2,Not what I expected :,"This book is not what I expected, and therefore not worth the money I paid for it. Although it had a little useful information in it, it really disappointed me. I have read it completely and find no use for it. Would love to have my money back to use for another purchase.I certainly won't be purchasing any more books by this author."
4,Andre Norton,"This may be the only Western novel Andre Norton ever wrote.Set in Texas after the end of the Civil War, the adventures are typical Norton."
3,"Great book, lousy formatting in one version","I love this story! I loved it decades ago when I read it in junior high. I think it's one of Norton's best YA stories, better than the first Drew Rennie, REBEL SPURS, which is more about the Civil War than anything else. It's great they made RIDE PROUD, REBEL available for Kindle, but in the $2.39 version from Optal eBooks all the Spanish words with tildes or accent marks are virtually illegible. If you want this book for Kindle, be sure to get the more expensive version ($4.79 in the Kindle store, publisher is Oak Grove) that has perfectly OK formatting of Spanish words. I actually deleted the first one (which I had paid for) from my Kindle and bought the more expensive version from Oak Grove because the Optal version was so bad! I would give the Oak Grove version five stars and the Optal version one, for an average of three!Honestly, how can you call yourself a publisher if you don't proof your products?"
1,Avoid Tripp-ian Thinking,"Ted Tripp's book and associated handbook are singly two of the most misguided interpretations of Scripture available on the market. Tripp's advocating of spanking a child for everything from looking at the parent in a wrong manner to using the rod because good Christian parents do that is sheer lunacy.Parents should be aware of what lurks within before buying this text. Tripp's beliefs fully destroy solid child rearing philosophies, advocating a barbaric return to unbridled corporal punishment through strong-arm tactics all in the name of God.This text is replete with unfounded, unsupportable, and ungodly ways to raise children."
1,UnChristian Cruelty,"I don't know which is more digusting, that someone would advise treating children so cruelly in the first place or that they would smear Jesus Christ and Christianity by doing it in Christ's name. Not only is the sadistic advice in this book alien to the teachings of Jesus, it is also alien to everything that modern science tells us produces happy, healthy, obedient children. Read the Bible (all of it, people!), read modern science, but avoid this vicious quackery like the plague! Shame on Amazon for selling a book like this and shame on them for removing reviews that are critical of it."
1,Avoid. Please.,It is very worrying that anyone with a belief in any loving God could think that this book is anything other than seriously misguided and deeply disturbing.
1,"Same fetishtic ideas,","Condensed in a pocket version for parents who can't learn, which is sickeningly ironic, the first time they read the book version."
3,Not what I thought...,"I was looking for the book, not the handbook. So I was disappointed to receive a reader's guide and not the actual book."
2,Shepherding a Child's Heart,This was not the book of the same title so it was not what I was expecting...
3,handbook,"I was looking for the book, not the handbook. Be careful, if you want the book, this is not what you are looking for."
1,NOT appropriate for church groups,"Due to the fact that Tripp is NOT Scripturally accurate in his interpretations of the rod verse, claiming the rod is somehow the parent, and that they must hit their children in order to discipline them, I do NOT recommend this for church groups!"
1,Disappointing & strange advice,"I am a Christian and I also found this book to be disturbing in quite a few areas. It came highly recommended and that surprises me. After talking with a few other Christian friends who have attempted to read it I am realizing it isn't as popular as the person who recommended it said it is. My advice is to find a different source for Christian parental advice. This author seems to be on a soap box of sorts, and essentially pats himself on the back for his own parenting style. There are some good points, but not enough to make it a worthwhile read."
4,Good tips,"Read some and watched the matching video series with our New parents fellowship group. Lots of solid parenting principles and advice, mostly for 6-18 yr olds I'd say. I feel Trip is a better writer than public speaker. Also look into the Ezzo's materials. Excellent from PreBirth-on. Toddler Years, and Growing Kid's God's Way (sounds pretentious, but brilliant principles). Together, you will have enough parenting things to work on for a long time, but blessed children which are a pleasure to be around. Ignore the far Left's anti-discipline evolutionary psychology hogwash, like don't spank. We should respectfully fear God (in a good way) and avoid evil; kids should respectfully fear their parents and being disciplined, and so be obedient for their own good."
3,It's a workbook!!!!,"I can't say I'm unhappy with this product, EXCEPT that I thought I was purchasing the actual book, not the workbook. I haven't even opened it--I'm sure it could help, but I wasn't intersted in the workbook, I just wanted the info."
4,Sunn o))) Sub Woofer,"The songs are simple long lowly sustained notes. Very little happens, many will not appreciate this album. The songs are great if you have a strong sub woofer.Feels like doom metal without the vocals to back it up. Overall not a bad album, highly encourage buyers to listen to some of their material first before purchasing."
3,Needed Depth,Our small group was looking for an in-depth study of Romans. This DVD gives archeological and cultural information about the time Romans was written. We wanted more depth on the actual book of Romans.
4,A reading grandparent,"This is a great book for younger kids, or kids just learning to read for themselves. I like everything Ravi Zacharais writes, and as with all his books, this brings the reader to a point of focus on Jesus."
5,"Great stuff, NOT Simple Green!","This is an excellent pitch remover. CMT 2050 is fast, effective, and easy to use with little to no scrubbing. I have also tried Simple Green to clean blades and bits, and don't know how the two could be confused."
3,Herbal Tonic Mist--Okay,"I got this product thinking it could be used as a moisturizer, but it's not! I've found that the other Earth Science products I use tend to dry my face out during these winter months, so I got this. It would be great for in between face washing, but the claim that it can be a moisturizer doesn't apply to me. I need to get a regular moisturizer. The fragrance is a little strong. As a tonic, it's very light."
4,Fingerpicks,"These picks are pretty good.Some notes about these picks:-I only use 1 or 2 picks at a time(one on my index, and one my middle), so the other 2 are like extras for me.-I gave the fingerpicks a 4 star because I'm not a big fan of the thumbpick. I'm 99% sure I'm using it right, but the thumbpick is hard to use. The way it is shaped makes it hard to pick with. I recommend buying a pack of plastic thumbpicks instead. But for the fingerpicks these are good.-They bend easily to shape your finger. Thats good for me becuase I have small hands and small fingers. They can definately fit any finger size though.-They are the least expensive metal fingerpicks i could find on Amazon.-They shipped pretty fast and without problems. Sam Ash also called me before hand to let me know."
1,O'Grady: modern = lukewarm,"As a long-time Christian but new Catholic, I found Fr. O'Grady's book to be extremely liberal in its outlook. He presents a spectrum of possible beliefs and moral stances, but I felt as if he favors the most liberal end of the spectrum: on abortion, homosexual behavior, birth control, even apostolic succession, his views seem calibrated to the ""lowest common denominator"". Possibly this represents an attempt to enhance ecumenical dialogue, a worthwhile goal, but not at the expense of declaring optional the v ery beliefs and teachings of one's own church.For American Catholics interested in falling right in with current society's norms, this book is for you. For those trying to learn what Catholicism is all about, and for new believers, I would stay away."
3,A Rare Openminded Treat.,"There aren't alot of mangas with Hermaphrodytes, especially the masculine body type. It's reccomended that you get the books if you thought the OAV was confusing & short. There are 2 volumes.This is basically a bisexual manga. It has a few unexplicit hentai scenes with a couple of doctors (you can tell what's going on, but nothing shows) It also has incestial feelings between Kimera & his attractive older brother. Unlike the OAV, Kimera's victims mistake him for a man rather than a woman."
2,"Nice attempt, fails in execution","The book provides an introduction to the accounting for derivatives. Its attempt is good, but it fails because it attempts to cover too much and worse it is riddled with mistakes. Many examples have one or more errors, making the book frustrating to follow."
4,must read,"this is not just a thriller but a must read for anyone who likes cambodia and cambodian history. Like the author of the Gate, Francois Bizot, Loup Durand was THERE (""I was there, Magnum."")He knows the details, right down to the street names and the backgrounds of historical incidents, the very days they happened and even what the crowds looked like on the streets. The characrtersa are not entirely cardboard, the plot is not simple but fairly complex, and the settings are authentic, at least the ones in Kampuchea. If you have lived there you will love this book."
2,Good primary source for historical purposes,"For just a penny, I am not complaining about the price. The book is dated but that's the point. This is a history book. It gives perspective and analysis of South African gold mining companies and their stocks from an era when owing investment gold was illegal in this country. In those days, you couldn't buy gold so you probably bought gold stocks."
5,Very exciting and suspenseful!,This was a wonderful series! I think this is my favorite of the four. Delaney and Chauncy were meant for each other. You fall in love with the characters from the start. She is determined to seek revenge on Delaney for her father's death and falls in love instead. No matter what happened in the past Delaney is there to find out who is trying to kill her and their love and passion is very strong!
2,Pretty stupid story and not very well written,"What a stupid book. I can't believe the glowing reviews by others. There were so many bed scenes, they got to be absolutely boring. The writing was juvenile and so predictable. I gave it 2 stars only because it was an easy read. The first half wasn't too bad; but I thought the 2nd half would never end."
2,not what I expected,Disappointed in the size of the diamonds and the flimsy gold. Would not recommend
5,mind tastes,"Hopeful, visionary, enlightened, stimulating, mind-expanding media upon which the viewer parks his ego/social games at the door and steps into wonderfully bizarre and edifying territory, indeed.Works well with ""Male or Female, Primitive Reflections Twisted From Sound."""
4,Interesting,"If at all interested in Terence McKenna, you should probably check this DVD out. The visuals aren't very complex, but the speech is a classic (on the Archaic Revival). There is one sequence which features crude, psychedelic images of phallics, which makes me feel uncomfortable on viewing. I don't understand why it's there. Anyways, when you get past the phallic scene, it's a classic psychedelic tale set to some decent visuals."
3,Not to Cool,I thought this was going to be better. The visual effects were not very good. Maybe real out of date by now. Mckenna on his first to rants didn't really make me interested in seeing the complete DVD. I watch the rest of it someday when I'm real bored. I'd pass on this one if I were you.
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased the Lexmark C500 in the hopes that it would print a variety of things -- typical word documents, spreadsheets, and invitations to my wedding (cardstock, envelopes, and address labels). The printer has failed in EVERY single application. It eats and melts envelopes, prints curled paper (the fuser unit gets extremely hot), and ink is splotchy and streaky in every font. Even simple PDF files come out with imperfections in the text, and the paper is wrinkly. The printer is loud and gives off a lot of heat. We are going to have to buy another printer, and I will NEVER buy a Lexmark again. I have since learned of others who have had problems with other Lexmark printers as well, which makes me think this is not a fluke. Even though this printer is rated ""very good"" at CNET, it's a piece of junk. Don't waste your money, and go buy a printer that works."
1,I'd give it zero stars if that was an option,"I've only had this printer 6 days and am considering putting it out with the garbage. I tried printing on the recommended photo paper and it puts black lines down the back of the paper. It also does not accept card stock very well. Lexmark support (misnomer) first said that it was a defective black cartridge then later said that the printer does not accept the type of paper I was using. Either way I'm dumping this sucker and going back to the HP. I'd advise anyone who wants to use other than just regular bond paper to not waster their money on this printer. Unfortunately I bought it at CompUSA brand new but can not return it because they're going out of business. An expensive lesson but I did learn. Bottom line, this printer is a hunk of junk!!!"
5,Excellent introductory book . . .,"I own a single employee service based business and recently made the jump from Quicken Home & Business to Quickbooks 2007 to prepare for growth, (and to appease my accountant). Quickbooks will take several hours to set up and get running for most people, and nothing beats good old trial and error experience, but this book helped a ton, especially when initially researching and preparing the initial ""defining"" of my company file. I own several Dummies' books, have always been a fan of the style of writing, and this book is no exception. Presently, it is the only book I have assisting me in running Quickbooks, and so far, it has been sufficient."
3,Decent book but not for someone familiar with Quickbooks,"Overall, the book was written well and it was easy to follow. Before buying it, I spent time learning Quickbooks on my own with the assistance of on-line help. Much of what was contained in this book was readily available from the application help files. If you are good at learning applications on your own or trying to understand more advanced features of Quickbooks, you may want to shop around for a different book. Quickbook novices will appreciate this as a first reference."
2,Quick Books,"Although this book is well written and enjoyable to read, I still could not make my Quick Books program meet my needs...I understand double entry bookkeeping, but somewhere I entered my info incorrectly, and cannot figure out from the book how to fix it, or even what to fix! Frustration!!!"
2,not what i expected,I was hoping that this book would be for an experienced Quickbooks user but it is not. It is designed for the novice user who doesn't know much about accounting.
2,Schoolly's first album must be reissued,"Overall, the selection here favors dumb stuff. ""Fat Gold Chain""? Come on.Schoolly now has at least 3 ""Best Of"" jobs, mostly compiled for tunes or anthems; this one's anthems, and comes off like someone's hoping to be picked up for a TV commercial. His first two albums are out of print, so Schoolly's oeuvre is being judged largely on later, inferior work, which is a real shame.Schoolly's 1986 debut ""Schoolly D"" (a 40 minute, six-song ""mini album"") is his (distinctive, standout) essential recording, and it hasn't dated like his (pretty good, but imitative) subsequent albums. It has never been issued properly on CD, but the Ryko compilation (also out of print) ""The Adventures of Schoolly D"" contains all 6 tracks.""Best Of Schoolly D"" begins with 3 of those 6 tracks, which should give you a feel for it. If you collect a lot of old rap, pay about $3 for the pleasure."
5,Gotta' Love It,All I have to say is that I love me some Schoolly D. And listening to it on a Bose Wave is the best! Don't even get me started!
1,Long live the king.,Terrible unreadable reprinted editionLong Live the King!. Sold/gave it away to Half Price Books. Very disappointed because I really wanted to read it. Rhinehart is a great mystery writer...every bit as good as Agatha Christie.
4,Interesting. Thought Provoking.,"This book is very thought provoking as to ""Could This Happen?""The book is well written, it flows well and keeps the reader intrested. Hard to put down. I would recommend reading Eric L. Haney's book, ""Inside Delta Force"" If you want to know more about how the D-boys have really operate."
4,Delta Force #1 : Operation Michael's Sword Book Review,"I thought the book was good, but me being a high school student I really didn't like the language. Once I was able to get around that it wasn't all too bad. I really liked how it was based on real time and it had the dates that corresponded with the events. It was really awesome when it started out talking about 911 and I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn more into military operations. I personally dont read much this is a book that I could get into and focus on."
2,Disappointing,"Though it's good to see that at last someone has written a book on Burroughs from a queer perspective, the author has such a limited and rigid idea of what counts as queer criticism that the book ultimately ignores most of what is interesting in Burroughs's fiction. The chapter on Naked Lunch, for example, focuses entirely on some rather questionable ideas about how to historicize the queer identity available in the 1950s, and thus ends up ignoring everything that is funny or satirical in a novel that is essentially comic and satirical (as well as being savage and caustic). The result is that every novel is viewed from a partial perspective that makes the book seem entirely thesis-driven, to the point that it simply ignores whatever is not grist for the author's mill."
5,Awesome CD,"Very tight ensemble, great technique, great arrangements. You can appreciate the technical proficiency of the group if you're a musician, or just the great tunes if you're not. Highly recommended."
3,It wears out its welcome but Turner is quite good,"This wartime romance directed by Mervyn LeRoy is a handsome MGM production that wears out its welcome by going on too long. What should have been a 90 minute sudser clocks in at about two hours. A self centered doctor (Clark Gable) seems to have it all. A successful and profitable practice, a beautiful wife (Anne Baxter) and home. When WWII comes and he goes to Italy as an army doctor, he slowly begins to realize the shallowness of his previous life especially when confronted by his feisty nurse (Lana Turner, deglamorized and very good). A tad sentimental in spots, it nevertheless makes some important points. John Hodiak, Gladys Cooper, Cameron Mitchell, and Marshall Thompson co-star. There's a lovely delicate score by Bronislau Kaper.The Warners Archives MOD DVD is a good transfer in the appropriate 1.33 aspect ratio."
1,No subtitles,"I have given a reaction to several DVD-R's already, and would have given this DVD 5 stars also if it had been subtitled. Why do Warner charge a much higher price for a DVD-R with no subtitles or other extras. I am willing to pay a reasonable price if only the DVD's would have subtitles. There are a lot of people having trouble following a movie if it is not subtitled. This way the company is earning a lot of money without giving what people might expect for such a price. Why not go on selling boxes with subtitles and some extras like before.Ad de Koning, Almere, Holland"
4,Homecoming,I saw this movie a long time ago and enjoyed watching it again. I feel that the story line is probably so close to what can happen in all wars. ther is plenty of Action as well as romance
3,"Stunningly clear photos, well-organized descriptive text","Although the focus in on suitable plants for warm climate gardeners, the stunning photos and informative text make this a useful reference for anyone interested in these lovely plants. Organized by type of plant, and well-indexed, the book guides the reader in selecting trees, shrubs, climbers, cacti, orchids, and other types of subtropical plants.Sufficient detail is given in the descriptions to get the gardener well started, and often alternatives are suggested should a particular plant be unavailable. The introduction refers briefly to suitable hardscaping, and some of the photos give examples, although most are close-ups more helpful for identification than for landscape design. For additional information on a number of these plants, seeOrnamental Plants & Flowers of Tropical Mexico."
1,Lousy Quality!,"As soon as the product arrived, the logo attachment fell off! The build quality is lousy and it keeps falling off repeatedly even after reattaching. Buy any other product; don't waste your money on this junk. A keychain should supposedly be extremely simple to make. Apparently not for Au-tomotive Gold."
2,not so hot,"Hmm. This book has some great pix, though none which haven't been published before. But it's a real confusing mish-mash trying to cover shoes say from rock and roll t glitter rock so that you have no idea what the context is.The other thing is that the writing appears a real rush job. There are some really grave errors - Johnny Rotten was never arrested for wearing one of the controversial Sex shop t-shirts and the correct spelling of the man who founded Carnaby street is John Stephen, not John Steven. May seem a bit anal I know but if you're going to cover this subject, at least pay attention.All in all a bit of an embrassment for Josh Sims who I think works at The Face."
3,a different book,dear readers and reviewersjust a quick note to say that this Hilfiger product is nothing to do with me! Mine ('Rock Fashion') is a different book altogether. I like to get the record straight...Happy reading.josh sims
4,New talk about the face on Mars makes this 1957 bk. timely.,The face on Mars is in the news now and few people know about this obscure but very interest- ing book. Dr. Fry was taken up in a remote controlsaucer from White Sands in 1957 and wastold about survivors of Atlantis whomade it to Mars in three spaceships and havebeen living in space ever since the atmosphereon Mars got too thin. I'll bet they made the faceon Mars. Read it and see what you think.
4,INTERESTING,"THIS EVENT HAPPENED JULY 4, 195O NOT IN 1957.THE NEW ISSUE OF THE BOOK LEAVES OUT THE DIAGRAM OF THE SPACECRAFT THAT THE ORIGINAL BOOK, BY BEST BOOKS OF LOUISVILLE,KY, CONTAINS.THE EXPLANATION OF HETRODYNING IS PLAUSABLE TO LOOK THRU A SEEMINGLY SOLID HATCH AS A VIEWING SCREEN.DON'T RECALL ANYTHING ABOUT MARS MENTIONED IN THE BOOK.WHERE IS OLE DAN AND A-LAN THESE DAYS? BILL FEW 11"
5,"If Everyone Read this Book, World Peace would be a Reality!","I've been a seeker on the path to enlightenment all my life. Have read many, many self-help, empowerment, spiritual books and participated in many seminars designed to help one achieve greater levels of awareness and self esteem. The Shining Self, by Selma Sayre, is one of the most brilliant, succinct, inspiring, clear explanations of what ""Life on Earth"" is all about and reminds me each time I read it of who ""I Am."" Originally published, over thirty years ago, I'm delighted that this wonderful little book has been revised and republished and made available at this time to everyone. I highly recommend The Shining Self! It's a crystal clear, amazing and inspiring book for all wishing to awaken to greater levels of awareness, joy and inner peace. You can be sure that I'm ordering copies for all my family and friends. It's truly a Classic Masterpiece!"
1,JUNK.,Gun proved defective and useless VERY quickly. Vendor refers returns to Mfg. only. Mfg. required me to pay shipping to fix their piece of junk. I was notgoing to double my investment in an obviously poorly made item so to the trash can it went. A TRUE RIP-OFF. I could NOT be more dissatisfied.
5,Good gadgets,Very good quality kitchen tools. A nice upgrade for my kitchen with all black appliances.
4,Kichenaid untensils,All pieces in the set work very well & look really nice. The only complaint is the can opener - it leaves parts of the lid attached and it rusts in & around the cutting wheel.
2,harlequin romance anyone???,"This book wasn't a bad read. However, for someone expecting a mystery, I found it 90% romance. Also, medievil life in Norman England was certainly a great deal more gritty than what is portrayed in this book. See Instance at the Fingerpost or Stolen Tongue for the real deal."
2,Yawn........,"This book is supposedly a romance/mystery set in medieval times. Unfortunately, it renders neither a medieval nor a romantic feel and the ""mystery"" is pretty transparent from the beginning.For much better medieval period romantic mysteries or just plain historical romance, try just about anything from Roberta Gellis. Although some of her novels contain explicit sex scenes, these don't take away from the superb plotting and historical authenticity they showcase."
1,Better than an old magazine,"This was the first and last book I will read by Joan Wolf. It was a poor attempt at what promised to be an engaging historical mystery. The characters are flat and the story lacks the details that could have made this a much better book. Someone who does not normally read mystery or history may enjoy this. Let me amend that to say someone who does not read much at all would enjoy this. It may seem interesting compared to an old magazine in a doctor's office.The story is nicely paced and does not drag too much; however, that is really the only favorable comment I can make about this book.I really wonder how this book was even published; it is not a professional effort."
2,"Mark Wiley, what?","If the book had been a more technical treatment, that would have been great. It has that, but not enough. But even still, what it did have would have been ggggreat if, only if, Mark had not put in a bunch of sillyness.What is the sillyness you ask? It is the goofy stories. I couldn't stand his little asides about the Magical Angel. I am so weary of the the ""super-master"" stories that some martial artists find so appealing. Keep in mind that I am not criticising Master Cabeles in anyway at all. I am sure he was great. But I think we diminish the greatness of lives lived when we begin to exagerate the reality of them. Let us be in awe of the real, not the fabrication we can easily make up.At times Mark seems like a 4 year old who sees in his mentor superhuman quality. That can be endearing the hands of a capable writer, but that Mark Willey is not."
5,A Escrimador of G.M. Angel Cabales since 1968.,"If any Martial Artists wants a complete understanding of the Serrada System, this is the book. I have read the book and it doesn't get any better than this. Mr Wiley is very accurate on the system and techniques because he is an Escrimador. He didn't just read some books than write this book. This book is long overdue. No one has given credit before like this book does, to the early students of G.M. Angel Cabales. In the early days G.M.Angel didn't have one paper, no application, class out line, or certificates of any kind. Everything you learned, you kept in your head, that way other students wouldn't know what number or how many blocks you really knew. Mr. Mark Wiley has given our great Master, Angel Cabales the highest honor by rewriting this new book. Tuttle Publishing has a top notch author of Fililino Martial Arts, and should be very lucky and proud of his quality products on Martial Arts."
4,Good Mix,Just what I needed .A mixture of history theory and practice. Good choice. Allows you to practice the basics while running ahead with the fun stuff.
3,Great book to learn a little about escrima,Good book to learn some basic strikes and history about serrada escrima.Descent pictures really like the sections about serrada instructors
1,Unauthorised!!,"So much for revealing the ""secrets"" of Cabales Escrima. Unfortunatly this book is quite the opposite. Wiley misquotes Angel on the back cover. Angel gave permission for a series of books on Cabales Serrada Escrima - Not just one book with all the good techniques left out. I'm sure the Grand Master would have been bitterly dissapointed with this effort by Wiley. The idea was to spread the knowledge of this fantastic system throughout the world in its entirety through a series of books - Not for an insecure person to greedily hoard the techniques for himself to reveal at seminars and private tuition."
3,Causes interference with baby monitor,"The wipe warmer was especially helpful in the first few weeks of our baby's life, when she screamed at cold wipes. A couple of problems though. Because it doesn't feature a pop-up design, it's difficult to get one wipe at a time. It becomes a two-handed trick of holding up the lid, pulling the wipes you want, and holding the rest of them down. The wipes at the bottom of the warmer end up drying out, so that becomes wasteful. My biggest problem with it is that even though it is about 2 feet away from the base of our baby monitor, every time the warming function comes on (about every 2 minutes), it causes such bad interference with the monitor that you can't hear the baby. So if I am out of the room and need the monitor on, I have to turn the wipe warmer off. Not a big deal, but very annoying. I would only recommend it for people who are able to put the warmer across the room from the baby monitor - that might help."
5,A must have!,"Try using a cold wipe on yourself one night and you will never doubt the importance of this little gem again! I leave ours on 24/7 and just flip the bottom wipes to the top once a day and it keeps them moist and reduces the browning (not a big deal anyway). I wish it had the pop up opition because most wipes come that way now but Huggies brand (or Target's generic) fit perfect and are not pop up style so they have worked best for us. I have found if you keep it 3/4 full it works best and keeps the wipes moist and warm. If it is too full the top does not get as warm as I would like and if almost empty the wipes dry out. Spend the money, I promise you won't regret it."
1,Buy only if you like throwing away wipes,That is what happened to us. The warmer dried out the wipes and I had to throw them away. I personally can't waste money like that.
2,Great idea....not so great product,"First, let me share THE SECRET TO STOPPING THE BROWN WIPES!...when you have used about 3/4 of the wipes, go for a refill and take the ones on the bottom and out, put the new ones in and put the others on top. Takes two seconds and because you don't let them go all the way down to the bottom before refilling they don't dry out. Wipes dry out becuase there are not enough in the container to maintain the moisture.Second...BUY A DIFFERENT WARMER! The organizer does not hold diapers past a size 1 without a cramming struggle to get them in and zip. The warmer just stopped working for no reason. The hooks are not that versitile and are awkward.I suggest buying a plastic organizer with the tray for the warmer on top (make sure it's big enough for a warmer and not just a tub of wipes!!)."
3,"Don't have this one, but....","My suggestion with those of you who have wipes is that I have found, personally, that the only wipes that seem to not dry out as much are made by Playtex and they are called ""Baby Magic""...they stay moist for quite sometime. Of course, with my diaper warmer, which is made by Prince Lionheart, the wipes do get a bit brown on the bottom, so I just switch them around on occasion so they do get used eventually. I also add a bit of water to keep them moist. I have tried everything from Huggies, Pampers, generic, etc. and find that Baby Magic are the best around. I can only find them in my area at Vons or Walgreens though..."
2,Not something I would recomend,I purchased this after I had my son thinking it would be useful. I found that when it got low on wipes it would burn onto the bottom. It was disappointing that it didn't work better than it did. The only good thing about this product was that it did heat the wipes nicely.
5,Probably one of the best gifts we received,"This product attaches nicely to the side of our changing table. It does dry out the bottom few wipes, but otherwise they are nice and toasty for the little bum. The diaper stacker is perfect and very convenient. No complaints here."
1,Junk,"It's not worth your time or money to buy this. It dries out the wipes and if you keep it on most of the time, it burns the bottom wipes. Now it just sits in the drawer. Hopefully we can pawn it off at a garage sale."
4,Baby will appreciate the warmth!,"This was a godsend to use especially when we had the baby in a Graco Pack and Play bassinet in our bedroom. It hung off the end of the bassinet/play pen to provide an area for storing all diapering needs. The wipe warmer is not a necessity, but I am sure that my baby will especially appreciate it in the winter. It does dry out the bottom wipes, but it also tends to create moisture due to the heat keeping the other wipes moist."
3,Nice Wipes Warmer,"This is ok. Like others have stated, it ""cooks"" about 20 wipes on the bottom and you have to throw them away. It does have a trendency to dry out the wipes because the top doesn't close all the way. As far as the bonus diaper organizer, I dont use it. I have a diaper stacker that I use instead. I do like the little pockets on the sides. I use it to put the hairbrush, nail clippers, medicine, and other small items. I'm not sure if I would use this one again if I had the chance."
2,Waste of Money,"I received this product as a gift. While it does warm the wipes nicely, the last 20 wipes are bone-dry and need to be thrown out."
1,Not worth it!,"My brother bought a wipe warmer for mt daughter before she was born. We hadn't registered for it because we thought it was silly. We decided not to return it and actually try it out. First of all, not all wipes fit in it. Many are too wide and have to be folded to fit in. The worst part about it is that the bottom ten or so wipes dry out. The last few actually turn brown. We were worried it was a fire hazard, so we put it away. It will go in our next garage sale with a warning to the buyer!"
1,"Don't need it, don't want it","I've always been against wipe warmers. They make baby get used to a certain degree of warmth, and when you're out and about, (say at the store) and your wipes aren't warm, they're all fussy about it. I got this as a gift however, and I thought why not. Bad idea. He expected the wipes to be warm, and didn't like them cold at all. I gave it away. However, it's not like my wipes are all that cold to begin with. I keep them near (not close to, but near) a vent so they're warm in the winter, and in the summer the cold feels good. In the car, they're usually warm. For decades, baby's have been cleaned with cold wipes. So what?"
2,dry wipes,"I found the warmer to dry the wipes out, I would put some water, although it advised not to, but it helped very little. The wipes werent always all that warm. And the bottom of wipes would turn brown..which does happen in other warmers. Overall, I'm not that happy with the product. Which is suprising, the brand is usally pretty reliable."
3,"Great concept, not practical","I got this before my daughter was born. I used the diaper hanger a lot, but honestly hardly ever used the warmer. I guess if you had one for each room it would be a good idea, but we live in a 2 story house and this was in her room. I found, we changed her wherever she was when it was needed, so the warmer wasn't always handy. I loved the idea of warm wipes on her little bottom, but it just didn't turn out to be practical and she didn't fuss about the cold ones."
1,"That's burning, not browning","I got this as a gift and hated it. The ""browning"" on the bottom made me nervous, because it meant that I had a device in the nursery that was constantly COOKING something! If the wipes are drying out AND being heated, I see that as a fire hazard. AND it left a hot spot on the dresser! I've never heard of anyone's house burning b/c of wipe warmers, but I don't want to be the first!"
1,Why waste your money!,"The wipes dry out and it is not a practical thing. I was under the impression that my poor baby would have to deal with super cold wipies and I had to have the wipey warmer. Totaly untrue... all you have to do is rub the wipey in your hands and it will be body tempature and that is just fine for baby. My baby has never cared if his wipes were warm or cold. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Go buy some toys, or something the baby will really enjoy."
2,Mediocre product,"While it did warm the wipes, it has some problems. I noticed that the wiring was flaky; it was plugged in, but not warming. I had to reposition where the power cord sat and it was fine. It seems to easily come off the organizer. Ours dropped once and one of the posts that makes the lid hinge broke. Depending how you have the diapers in the organizer, trying to take one out could send the rest to the floor. Overall, something I could do without."
1,what a waste of money!,"We were very disapointed in this product. The warmer dries out the baby wipes and the pampers brand wipes do not even fit. Who has time to fold all the wipes in half when filling the warmer? The wipes on the bottom turned brown and looked like a fire hazard! When you remove the warmed wipe from the warmer, it is luke warm at best so by the time it reaches the baby it has already cooled off. The pockets are too short to hold the diaper cream and other items. I am going to return this piece of junk to the store."
2,Thought it would be better,"We used this when our baby first came home and we loved that it kept the wipes warm. The problem is that it dries out the wipes. We were losing about 5-10 wipes each time we loaded it up because they were dry by the time we got to them (which wasn't long with a newborn!). We stopped using it and it is now collecting dust. I don't know if we will try it again, but we were not thrilled."
2,Not the best...,"I would like for this to be warmer. The wipes cool in about three seconds. Also, the diaper organizer is good for keeping diapers in but the pockets are way too small. The biggest one holds a small bottle and that is what I used it for as my glider was next to the bed. All of my other suppies were to big."
1,Disappointing & frustrating,"I was so excited to find a warmer & organizer at such a reasonable cost. Unfortunately I ended up spending more time than money with this. I exchanged it twice & the third time just asked for store credit. The first time I returned it was due to the brackets not lining up correctly, the second time was because the warmer had stopped working & the third time was again because the warmer had stopped working. This was very frustrating because the organizer was a big help. I eneded up purchasing a warmer/organizer from another company."
3,Worthwhile gadget,"In general terms I liked this item b/c cleaning a baby's bottom with cold humid wipies can't be pleasant (for baby)... I love the removable storage space (for diapers, brush, combs, creams) underneath the actual warmer. The one thing I disliked is that the wipies have a tendency to become dry (not usable) if the warmer is left on for days; you can avoid this by turning it off and on (it has a switch) but it takes about 2-3 hours for it to warm up again so this isn't very convinient. At first this didn't matter as I went through wipies like water; but after my daughter started to 'go' less it became a little problem. Once she turned 3 months I stopped using it as a wipies warmer and just use it as a wipies holder. My daughter is almost 4 months old."
4,nice surprise,"I received this product as a shower gift, and thought I would never use it. But when my baby was born during one of the coldest winters in our city's history, I decided to give it a try. Well, my baby certainly preferred the warmth on his bottom, to the cold! This product is very easy to use, warms the wipes to the perfect temperature, and made diaper changing a better experience for my newborn. I never used the diaper organizer, because I had already purchased the ""diaper depot"" for my dresser."
2,Anxious to return this product!,"The diaper holder is a great convenience. The warmer unfortunately is more of an inconvenience than anything else. The lid does not close tightly enough, so all the diapers dry out. By the time you get to the bottom ones, they are so dry and burnt, you may as well use cold wipes!"
2,"It's Good, BUT . . .","The warmer does warm the wipes well, but we've wasted a lot of wipes because they would dry out. You can't fit many diapers in the bottom part (as the baby grows, less room for bigger diapers). I would not recommend this product."
1,Not So Great,"When our first son was born this past May, he hated cold wipes so we thought this would be the perfect answer. NOT! The wipes always dried out and the bottom ones were burnt. Needless to say, our son got used to the cold wipes! Not worth the money."
1,not worth the money,We bought this before our sone was born thinking that this was a good idea and also after reading other reviews. But it was not worth the money. The wipes dry out and you waste more wipes this way.
3,"It's not perfect, but it works","It really warm up the wipes, what was perfect for my daughter who was a winter baby. If you don't use a lot of wipes daily they would get dry, but if you do use a lot (like me) they would not get dry. Be sure to buy a very moist wipes.... The only reason why I didn't give the 5 starts, is because it have a really ugly diaper organizer (that didn't match with my daughter's pink room) and we couldn't take it out... and when we try we almost brake it, so is not very durable either.."
5,GREAT!,"December 2002:I love this product! Yes it dries out the last few wipes in the bottom...and turns them brown...but ALL wipe warmers do that! Losing a few wipes is WELL worth it! Most wipes will fit.I do think that Huggies wipes work best! It says not to add water, but if they do start to dry out, I have added a couple of tablespoons to it and that moistened them right up!UPDATE:It has been 2 years now. This warmer has been ON the entire time and still works great!"
2,Not worth the money,I was very excited when I purchased this item I thought it was a great idea until I discovered it would dry out the wipes before I could even use them!
1,warmer good but not other features,"pockets are too shallow and don't hold lotions or powder...don't really hold much of anything bigger/taller than q-tips or alcohol swabs...diaper section is okay but not really ideal...doesn't hold enough diapers, constantly would have to be refilling it. Wipe warmer was best feature and was okay but at the same time wasn't that great...if don't keep full at all times seems to burn and dry bottom 1/3 of wipes in container...if looking for a wamer, go for the seperate pop up type...and for storage just go for baskets to store things and place on changing table or get a changing table with drawers to store things in...also, entire item doesn't really hang well on the side of my changing table, not very secure...definately would NOT recommend."
3,Only functional for a while,The wipe warmer works fine but it does dry wipes out from the bottom. Works better if you keepa damp wash cloth at the bottom. The diaper organizer works up to size 2 diapers. Size 3 diapers & beyond just don't fit right...Sometimes this item works too well & the wipes are too hot for immediate use.
2,Not all its cracked up to be,"This item is really a waste of money. The wipes do get warm, but they dry out so fast that you can only get through half a stack before having to throw them away. Further, it warms from the bottom, which means that the ones that get dried out are the ones that are the warmest...totally defeating the purpose of the product. Huggies wipes are the quickest to dry out. Pampers wipes tend to stay moist longer, BUT...they make so much condensation on the lid of the warmer that I make a mess just reaching in for the wipe. Bottom Line: wate of money and space on the changing table. My son doesn't even seem to notice cold wipes anyway."
1,VERY IMPRACTICAL!,"I RECEIVED THIS AS A SHOWER GIFT FOR MY NOW 3 MONTH OLD LITTLE GIRL. I THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE A GREAT IDEA, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE PRODUCT WAS MADE A WHOLE LOT BETTER. FIRST OF ALL THE MACHINE SHOULD BE BATTERY OPERATED NOT PLUG IN. IT WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE CONVENIENT THAT WAY. SECOND OF ALL IT DRIES THE WIPES. LASTLEY THE UNDER COMPARTMENT IT TOO FLIMSY TO HOLD ANYTHING. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. EVEN IF YOU RECEIVE IT AS A GIFT RETURN IT FOR STORE CREDIT AND GET SOMETHING YOU CAN REALLY USE."
3,Giving this a 3,"Yes, it does dry up if you just leave the warmer on. Its a big hastle to just plug and unplug to keep the baby wipes warm for your baby booty. I pretty much gave up on that and just use it to store my baby wipes and the bottom section to put diapers. Its easy to reach over to the side of my baby changing station (same height). Its very convient to use. The only bad thing about this is that the warmer stays on too long it dries up. I just warm it by holding the wipes in my hand until i think its warm enough for my baby booty. The best way, you could get a small heat where you can hold it up to it and warm it until its ready to be used. It doesnt take that long. Thats a suggestion."
4,Love this!,"I bought this for my newborn and we couldnt live w/o it now. It is so great to have this. The diaperholder is great too, a little bit frustrating( reason for only 4 rating) because the zipper doesnt unzip all the way around and the diapers fall out when i reach in. But you can use it for other things too, burp cloths or cloth diapers... It does tend to dry out and turn the bottom few wipes brown, but as others have stated there are ways to avoid that.. Overall i think this item is great and a great bargain."
2,"Warms, but seems dangerous!","My husband purchased this item for our daughter. It does it's job, though we had to change from pampers wipes to ones that are more narrow to fit in the holder. The problem that I have is that if it is 2/3 full or less, the wipes on the bottom dry out and seem to start to burn! I pull out 4-5 wipes weekly that are dry and orange/charred from the heating element on the bottom. I seem to be refilling it more than once a week to try and combat the drying out. Also, instead of using the storage we put it on the dresser, which also gets too hot to touch if it is moved. It just seems a little dangerous to me. Not worth the money. I wish the stores or online store sold the wrap around warmer. It wraps around any wipes container that you have and plugs in. It doesn't get too warm, but still manages to warm the wipes. AND it's half of the price!"
1,Not all wipes fit!,"The container says that it fits all wipes, so we bought it. Our 2 week old screams when the cold wipe touches his bum. After putting it all together and plugging it in we realized that Pampers wipes do not fit in the warmer. It was a huge disappointment!"
2,Get the wrap-around kind instead,"First of all, this thing dries out wipes, even if you do add the 1/4 cup of water you're supposed to add every couple of days! It also restricts you in the kind of wipes you can buy... forget getting Chubbs in its round container, for instance. The little storage area is a nice idea, but it's rather flimsy and not very supportive. Your best bet would be to get one of the wrap-around warmers, which have cute pastel designs on them and mold to the shape of the wipe tub. These take up far less room and are much easier to clean, too. This one? You'll be continuously wiping it down, when it hasn't fallen over, that is."
3,Great while it lasted,This was really nice to have warm wipes on the very cold days however it only lasted for 4 months
2,Wipes get cool before they get to baby's bottom,I thought this would be a wonderful way to be nice to our baby with the warmer wipes but it seems like they feel good when I initially open the door and get the wipe but it seems like they are already cold again by the time I start using it on the baby. Also the bottom few wipes always seem to get dry and brown so we waste a few wipes with each refill. It's an OK product but if I wouldn't buy it again.
3,Works just okay...,"This wipes warmer is better in my opinion than the lionheart (or whatever it's called)-that thing completely dried out every wipe withing one day. This warmer should only be used with a few wipes at a time as they will completely dry out too. Just make sure to restock it everyday. Otherwise, I would only recommend using it if it's cold-they don't need it in the summer where I live. I use the organizer underneath it for diapers more than anything. For the money, it's worth it I suppose."
2,There are probably better warmers out there,This warmer is OK. It warms the wipes and has storage for diaper creams and diapers. It is not wise to put an entire pack of refills in it as they do dry out and the bottom ones will turn yellow and brown. My biggest problem was that it does not enable you to use the pop-up wipes. You can not pull the wipes out one-handed because it will not disperse the wipes one at a time. If I tried to pull out one wipe - ten would come out due to the way the wipe companies fold and interlock the wipes. Unfortunately all of the wipes we purchased are folded to work with a pop-up dispenser. I eventually just put this away and stopped using it.
1,Worthless,Please don't waste your money. It dries out the wipes so bad. I stopped using it almost immediately. I'll listen to what other reviewers say next time.
4,"Bound Women, Some hard to see due to shading . . .","A collection of black and white drawings of women in bondage (nude, clothed, most in distress, out in public, in private). Interesting collection of pencil? drawings. The cover and back are in color and show how much better this book could have been if all the pictures, or at least more of the pictures had been in color. The pictures are ok as black and white drawings, but some of them have been taken a step further from viewing ease some odd shading choices. Some pictures are very heavily shaded against a very dark/shaded background."
5,Very pleased,"This is a very easy book to read, and the suggestions it offers are real and practical. You don't have to change your entire lifestyle, and that's what I liked about the book. And too, the five steps it recommeds have already been put into use by families, and they've all been proven to work. It definately has helped my family. I've already seen a difference in waist size and attitude."
4,Good basic information,"This book was well organized, easy to read and understand, and gave good basic information. The healthy eating solutions are easy to implement in daily life. I learned some new things and remembered some things I already knew."
3,Not Very Realistic,The only way this will work is if the person hitting has never played before. But when it does work its very funny.
3,Good Expository Perspective on Counseling,"Powlison provides a solid analytical expository perspective on counseling that is helpful and insightful. I personally found the last 200 pages much more motivating than the first 58 pages. His exposition of Ephesians 5:21 through 6:9, several Psalms, and Luke 12:22-34 is excellent. Similarly, his annotated list of X-ray questions (chapter 7) is the best I have seen. His biblical analysis of defense mechanisms is extremely helpful as are his chapters on ""Love Speaks Many Languages Fluently"" and ""Biological Psychiatry"". To write this book Mr. Powlison patched together a series of articles that he had previously authored. Unfortunately, his book ends up coming across as just that, a patchwork of articles that lack a uniform purpose other than the general theme of Biblical Counseling. If you have an interest in two or three of the topics I have highlighted this book is probably well worth the purchase."
2,pigeon peas,"These are NOT the pigeon peas used in England to make the Lancashire dish of parched peas (also called Carlin peas). I had written tothe seller who did not know what country they came from but i thought i would give them a try anyway as i really wanted some ""black peas"".They are not at all similiar and i ended up throwing them out as the taste was awful. If you want the traditional Lancashire dish...don'tbuy these!!"
3,Not White Acre Peas,I was looking for White Acre Peas and the search sent me to Pigeon Peas. Not even close. Pigeon Peas are more like Black Eyed peas with a more woodsy taste. And Pigeon Peas take forever to cook. They were ok but I will not buy them again. It is easier to get a can of black eyed peas and season.
4,Book does what you think it should.,"How do you review a book??? It does what it says it does, it tells you about firefox and it is for people that have litte or no idea on what firefox is. The person I brought it for said it helped them out. They were glad to recieve it."
3,Messy delivery,Tape had been wrapped around the top and glad it was because the lid was loose and shampoo filled the tape. Quite the mess getting off and then cleaning up the bottle. Lost some product. Also the picture shows the pump dispenser as this is a big bottle and it wasn't in the package. Was dissppointed.
5,Thikk Hair,I really like this product. My hair rinses out well and drys so thikk. This is a great product. I don't use anything else.
4,Worth A Listen for Any Who Fan...,"If you are a fan of The Who than this is definately an album you should have. It is a Pete Townshend solo album, but it's also contains the first new Who songs after they broke up following It's Hard. The songs are Dig and Fire, and these along with Pete's solo songs make for a very enjoyable musical experience. It is a concept album, so like some of The Who's other work, it tells a story through the music, which I have always been a big fan of. I think it is one of Pete's finest albums and a rare gem for Who fans."
5,Acts and Sings!,"I didn't know that Jennifer Love Hewitt sang until I was searching on here for one of her movies. After I saw it I looked up her song ""Bare Naked"" and loved it!! The whole CD is really amazing!! She's one of the few who can act AND sing!"
4,Wow,I bought this on a whim and wasn't really sure I would like it. But it is great! the songs are very catchy and well written. Not the bubble gum I was afraid I was going to get.
4,I am very suprised.,"I must say that the girl has a voice. She is not bad at all. She has been trying to brake to the music business for some time now, but for some reason...it is hard for her. I liked the album...I am not sue if she writes her own songs but for any female...can relate."
5,BareNaked Jennifer Love Hewitt,I have always love Jennifer Love Hewitt and her diva self as well as her tv show Ghost Whisper I received my purchase as promised and in the condition promised...
2,Love Hewitt's Return,"After hearing, ""How Do I Deal,"" in 1998, I figured Jennifer had some promise. Yes, Jennifer Love does have promise but not as much as fellow label mates Britney Spears, Nick Carter, Justin Timberlake, and *NSYNC. ""Barenaked,"" wasn't a huge hit, it was embraced by certain radio and MTV didn't play it much. ""Barenaked,"" is probably the album's best song. Overall the album is average."
4,Another very good album,"Another very good album by Jennifer. We like all types of music, We enjoy listening to music all the time. This addition to our vast collection of many types of music is welcomed. We all enjoy it Jennifer's music and I am sure anyone who listens to her music will enjoy it as well."
3,Almost a Hit!,"Unfortunately for Miss Hewitt, this album will fall short of a hit. Although there are some songs, like ""Bare Naked"" with a catchy tune and ""You"" with a simple harmony...songs like ""Me and Bobby McGee"" simply [aren't good]. The sound out of her beautiful mouth sounds forced and out of place. I'm not sure why this is her ""Breakout"" album, but her last album Jennifer Love Hewitt, kept it simpler and had smoother vocals. I thought for sure, that her release on the I Still Know What You Did Last Summer Sndtrk. was so good that a top producer would be able to meet the challenge of finding more like songs and make a hit album.Her voice is beautiful and I truly hope her next album fares better than this one."
4,A great improvement.,"All I have to say is that I LOVE this album. It's really good. This is her most solid effort to date. I've always been a huge fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt, the singer, but up until this point all her albums have been rather hit and miss. A few great songs, but a lot of filler. Whereas this one is excellent all the way through. I really like the new more rock direction she is going. Her voice has never sounded better. Standout tracks include ""First Time"", ""You"", ""Where You Gonna Run To?"", ""Barenaked"", ""Stand In Your Way"" and her rendition of ""Me and Bobby McGee"" is excellent!"
4,Some Good Comfort Music ;-),"Jennifer did a wonderful job on this album. Her voice and her message are both examples of what I'd like to see more of in the music industry. Comfort music, is what I think of it as. I pop it in and it makes me feel good. Some of the songs lyrical content may be a little passé, rather stale... and sometimes hard to listen to when that guy is giving his little rap off on a few of the tracks... yeah, that, in particular, starts to become annoying. Music is also very solid on most tracks, although there are a few that rely to much on musical clichés to get them through to the ending. Overall, I really do enjoy the majority of this album and hope that, every once in a while, JLH keeps giving us some more of the same..."
2,Could be better,"When I listen to this CD I stick to two songs, #3 & #8. I find that out of all of the songs these are the only ones that give a glimpse of Hewitt's talent. I find that the rest of the songs are a product of bad production and poor writing. Ms. Hewitt can definitely sing, but what she really needs is a strong team to help make her tallent shine. I gave the CD 2 stars, one for each song I like."
5,i knew i'd like it,"I'm probably one of the few people who knew Jennifer Love Hewitt has been making cds since the 90s. I loved her self-titled cd and was hooked upon the first vocal. After getting Let's Go Bang, I could see how much the music matured with the self-titled cd.I heard about this cd a few months ago and saw her perform it on some tv show. I was only slightly impressed. I bought the cd anyway and after the first listen, I know that it's going to be played over and over again just like her other cd.I think if people give it a try, they will be really shocked at the quality of the music and her voice. She's not just another actress who wants to sing, too. She really is good at both.I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys addicting pop music or who has a love for the female voice."
2,Horrible,"I think this is a terrible cd. I was very dissapointed. I listened to the first song, Barenaked, and then skipped through everything else. The last song, Bobby Mcgee and Me is horrible! I love Jen as an actress, but she lacks talent as a singer. I could hear the stress in her voice when she would try to hit certain notes. Don't waste your money buying it."
1,politically corrrect,"I was looking forward to reading an account of this fantastic feat, in the context of the Industrial Revolution, 19th century adventurism, enlightened colonialism. Instead I found myself reading about what a flop the whole thing turned out to be and how insensitive and greedy the Europeans were towards the proud, virtuous and vastly superior-from-a-cultural-standpoint Arabs who happened to be in the place where the ditch was dug. The author doesn't conceal his indifference for the engineering aspects of the canal and is far too eager to show off his knowledge of Middle Eastern culture, of which his relentlessly reverential view is just too PC for me! I am now reading a far more stimulating and satisfying account of Suez contained in ""The Path Between the Seas"" by David McCullough, the main subject of which is the Panama Canal."
3,Little Errors,"On page three the author declares that Louis IX, St.. Louis, died at Damietta, in Egypt. He repeats this on page 13. Louis IX died in Tunis, years after leaving Damietta. The place of Louis IX's death has no bearing on the subject of the book but the error suggests that the author deals with facts in a rather offhand way."
3,"Interesting, but not Exceptional","PARTING THE DESERT is a quick read that will fill-in the interested on the Suez Canal. However it reads more like an ode to Ferdinand de Lesseps and could have been his biography.Frankly, I believe the story would have been better told if there had been a larger discussion of the technology and management developed rather than the battle of egos that delayed the project.A better story of accomplishment is A THREAD ACROSS THE OCEAN by John Steele Gordon about the first transatlantic cable. Incidently, both projects were occuring at the same time.A good filler for those interested in the politics of the French 2nd Empire, but, does not add much to those looking for the history of technology and innovation."
4,Jazz for the holidays,A friend of mine recommended this for a jazzy Christmas season and I'm happy to report it turned out to be a great purchase. The intermittent vocals numbers are a nice touch and the instrumentals maintain a healthy balance between melody and improvisation.
3,"Some strong elements, but overall a second-tier NT intro","Perkins leaves no stone unturned, covering the gammut of issues that one would expect to find in a scholarly NT introduction. However, her treatment of the issues is not thorough enough even for an introductory text. While this book certainly lays an adequate foundation, there are other NT introductions that offer more complete scholarship without sacrificing readability. If you are only looking to read one NT intro, I would recommend ""The Writings of the New Testament"" by Luke Timothy Johnson instead. I would recommend this book only if you are interested in comparing several NT intros."
4,worthwhile new testament introduction,"Perkins' work is a solid scholarly introduction to the New Testament. I found it very helpful and enlightening as an undergraduate textbook. Although leaning to the theological left on some issues, Ms. Perkins' volume provides valuable information for students of the New Testament."
4,Haven't read it yet,"but I wanted to comment on a review. This book appears to be a text book for Biblical study. The ""Top 100 Reviewer"" who was upset about the use of abbreviations for the titles of books of the Bible seems never to have read commentaries before, where this is always the case. A commentary does not read like a regular book. Perhaps the reviewer will realize that his review was colored by the fact that he just didn't realize what type of book he was reading."
4,Good book for those who want to look beyond the obvious.,A good book for anyone who wants to look beyond the things heard in churches where looking at the text with an open mind is frowned upon.
2,not very impressive,"I do not think it is wise to use this book (or Gerd Theissens) as there are many NT introductory works that are much more worked out. Not only to the teacher this is patently clear, but especially students who read a chapter by Perkins and then go over the same topic by Brown, Guthrie, Witherington or Kümmel. The student will immediately find (s)he's been reading assumptions, positions and ideas that are not motivated, but simply based on traditional general pictures. There is quite some backreading of modern criteria into the first century and too often the jewish purpose of the books are underlooked. I realise Perkins has been a useful person as a teacher, but this is not a good book. Choose something else."
1,Worst Trek Novel I've Read in a Long Time!,"I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this novel, but it was written so badly, and the plot was not only contrived, it made NO sense. It takes the already existing damage to the Borg's credibility (from First Contact and Voyager) and makes it 1000 times worse. Beyond that, none of the characters are believable, especially Scotty, who comes across as Dennis the Menace:The Next Generation. Ugh. HATE for this book is all I have. I gave it away by leaving it in a public spot (after registering on bookcrossing.com)"
1,This engine needs tuning!!,"I love TOS stories but I was very disappointed with this one. The motivation for Scotty to screw up history was very poor and the characters just felt very wrong to me. Also, considering this was supposed to be a borg story, where were the borg? There were just a few bits with the Queen and not a lot else. Someone told me this book was lost in 2001. It should have stayed lost!!!"
3,"If you've read other ST novels, might as well this one....","I was a bit underwhelmed by this book. One possible reason for this is that I had just finished reading Federation for the 2nd time, which is easily the best Star Trek book written to date. Other possible reasons as the poor characterizations of Kirk, who was made out to be quite a goofball, in my opinion. Overall, it was a fairly well written book, the writing style being much easier to stay with than Shatner's stuff. Read this book BEFORE you read Federation, so you won't be so disappointed."
3,Disappointing ending,"The premise and the buyildup to the end are very good, but the resolution just makes no sense. Why the choice made ""corrects"" the timeline is in no way obvious. Too bad."
3,Major Problem,"I looked over the reviews and was suprised that no one made the observation that in the film Generations it was QUITE clear that you can't go to the Nexus, the Nexus must come to you. That's why the evil genius blows up all these planets to change gravity, hence change the Nexus' course to come to him.Well, in this novel that all changed. Here, it's possible to transport into the Nexus. For that matter, why doesn't Guinan transport in there too since she misses so much. For me, this spoiled the book. What was the author thinking?"
3,Reads like a fanfic,"While reading this novel, the feeling that the writing was too contrived was consistent.(Possible spoiler alert) While I can grant the Kirk Borg link, all the plot devices appeared entirely too convenient and made only for this story not really in keeping with the Trek franchise...for example, why would any being - not protected in a time catastrophe - have any recollection of an alternate timeline?That being said, it was still a decent read, an interesting take on what might have happened if the Borg Queen had indeed succeeded in the First Contact scenario."
5,It can be fine-o!,"Having lived in Liberia for 2 years in the early 70's, this book was very personal to me. I thought Powers did a wonderful job capturing many aspects of life in this nation that has been ruined by corrupt leadership for so long. As the Liberians say, the powers above ""ate"" all the money, leaving the wonderful everyday people impoverished. These people have never given up, and they deserve for their hopes and dreams to be answered in this upcoming election. They continue to ""try-small"", which is amazing considering all that they have been through. Thank you Mr. Powers for your wonderful details and insights on life in Liberia at the turn of the Century!"
2,Average but enjoyable,"As a fan of Philadelphia pop music I gave the a-sides a try. It is well produced....sonically, but lacks any particular distinction or direction. It sounds to me like a bunch of kids who listen to the Beatles way too often. Sometimes young bands will almost bypass the grueling process of finding their own voice and leap right into trying to make records they're clearly not ready for. The A-sides are a band of potential but need to look themselves in the mirror and figure out how they can use their talents in a NEW and unique way. I already own sgt. pepper's and pet sounds....I don't need to hear it again."
5,Blend of musical cultures,"An exquisite and unusual blending of baroque musical style, flawlessly executed, with traditional jewish text. A rare find ."
5,Great Riflescope,"Quality construction all around. This is probably the clearest scope I've ever owned, with optics comparable to scopes costing over a thousand dollars. I love it!!!!!!"
5,Great figure!,I disagree: so much detail has been packed into 7 inches!It's the perfect Bride!This is a prefect item for those of us film dorks that crave film memorablia covering every nook and cranny of our homes. Hoo Hah
4,One of my favorite books,"It was always refreshing to see the Baby-Sitters Club encounter kids that were different in some way (for example, Kristin babysat an autistic girl) In this book, Jessi takes on the baby-sitting duty of a boy who is deaf. The book was well-written and researched. Yes, it's a kids' book, so it doesn't offer a complex perspective in the world of the deaf or anything like that, but for its reading level, the context was presented appropriately, and it was cool to see Jessi learn sign language."
3,Basic info provided,"This book was required reading for a Bilingual Education course I was taking. It has a lot of information, speficially with regards to all the different varieties of Bilingual Ed. and major research on the topic, but was a dry read for sure. Lots of facts crammed into each passage, but if your goal is to become proficient in all things about Bilingual Ed., go for it. This book was recommended by our professor as a tool in preparing for our state's bilingual education certification exam."
2,Too much useless information,"This book would be great if the title of the exam was ""every thing you could possibly know about Windows 2000 Server Architecture"". The book bogs you down with so much useless information about the design of 2000 Server. Instead of focusing on what you need to pass the test this book drones on endlessly about the most trivial apseects of the operating system."
1,Leaves out major material - like the Active Directory,"The book started out very good. But then as I moved into Chapter 2 and started trying the hands-on exercises, I found they were out of date. The URL for the Readiness Analyzer had a date of October 2000 and said the R.A. is no longer available. On page 135, it said the R.A. was also available on the Server CD, but I searched it and could not find it. Then in Chapter 3, I successfully updated NT4 Server to W2KServer, but there was no mention of Active Directoy - which was required for hands on in Chapter 4. I sent an email to the email address listed in the book. I got bakc a reply I would have expected from another publisher. They simply suggested I check their errata website. I did and it had ZERO updates and ZERO corrections. So I feel if you pay $50 for this book, if you pay $15 for this book, you are completely wasting your money!"
3,A good tutorial but not the test prep tool,"Actually I like this book. It has lots of info, a good style with some sense of humor, pretty wide and deep coverage, very logical. You can definitly learn about Win 2000 server from this book. The only problem it doesn't help much in your exam preparation. The test questions are very specific and it helps more to buy some question samples then to read books like this, even if it is a good book."
2,bad proof reading or useless book?,"I bought this book based on the fact that it has a lot of exam-type questions. Unfortunately, the answers are in a section entitled '...questiosn'. A basic diagram in the first chapter or two was clearly incorrect. The authors recommend setting up AD on organizational boundaries - a sure trip to major hassles, as companies reorganize all the time.I'm a beginner in Windows, after a long career deep into the bits and bytes of MVS. I do not know if this is a bad book, but I do know that the errors I've found make me wary of everything in it."
2,IM GLAD THIS WAS ON SALE,"I BROUGHT THIS PRODUCT AT A HEALTH STORE FOR 1/2 ITS NORMAL PRICE. WHEN I MIX THIS WITH SPLENDA AND SOME MILK IT TASTE REALLY GOOD. IF I ONLY USE COLD WATER (8OZ) THEN IT TASTE PRETTY BLAND, BUT NOT SO BAD YOU WANT TO THROW UP."
2,Underwheming,"This is the first book I read in the ""Seal Team Seven"" series. I am a big fan of Douglass' work, though. I read the first installment in the ""Carrier"" series in which an American spy ship is captured off the coast of North Korea. Needless to say, I was hooked. Sadly, ""Battleground"" is nowhere near as good as Carrier. The action scenes are boring and become quickly repetitive. None of the characters are particularly interesting either. I found the action derivative of the standard action movie cliche in which the bad guys can't shoot to save their lives but the good guys score a hit every time. I was sorely dissapointed in the book and am glad I got out of the library for free."
2,"Fun, but poorly edited","Although I enjoy reading the series, it is frustrating to see the total lack of editing. With 14 years in the Navy, 4 in Naval Special Warfare, I spend as much time saying ""What! No way!"" It would be so easy to find someone who would be willing to offer constructive criticism and make the series much better."
4,Excellent,"This book really describes weapons specifications and war politics if you are into those. The book includes real training methods used by real SEALs in Boot Camp. The book so excellently describes the SEAL's missions it's as if you are there with the SEALs. Non-stop action and the introduction of new weapons and scenarios is excellent in this book. Definetely one of my favorites. I have all of the Seal Team Seven series right now. Waiting, hoping, for more. :-)"
5,A truly exciting and action-packed book by Douglass,"This is the first book I had a chance to read in the Seal Team Seven series and also the first book I ever read about Seals. The book is filled with action, realistic missions, high-tech warfare, and the best and most up-to-date tactical weapons and equipment. I guarantee you are NOT wasting your money if you buy this book! After I read this book, I went out and bought every other book in the series. Keith Douglass has gone from being an author I never heard of, to my favourite (that's right I am Canadian, so I did not make a spelling mistake)author! I am just praying he writes many more in the series. I am not going to give any of the book away, so all I will tell you is buy it!!!! It is a very exciting book! I have read the book six times and it has gotten my adrenaline going each time. Once you read it, please e-mail and let me know what you think. And just because I am Canadian who says I can't love the U.S. Navy Seals?"
1,Dime Store Novel,"While this book has a potentially interesting premise, it is illogicaly written (the bad guys are holding 160 US sailors in a prison, we aren't sure where - but lets crash in and shoot it up with the guards until we rescue the prisoners), (we need to rescue the hostages inside the captured embassey, so anyone who runs out we'll assume is a bad guy and shoot automatically), etc. Almost more embarrassing is the poor editing; Sea Knight helicopters become Sea King helicopters in the next paragraph, Major Mudodo becomes a Captain one paragraph later, the hero sends 'Bishop' to do something but 'Brown' reports back a few paragraphs later."
1,Verseo Perfect Profile,It doesn't work for me. I can get the same results by massaging with my own fingers. A total waste of money.
2,Delillo's worst published effort,"I could seriously argue that Delillo is America's greatest living author. This, however, does not prove it."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"For those looking for a bit of light reading, I would advise against this book. True, very little of DeLillo is easygoing, but this, his fourth novel, makes his others read as easily as the likes of Grisham or King. Ratner's Star can perhaps be best described as DeLillo does Pynchon's ""Gravity's Rainbow."" It focuses on a group of quirky scientists and mathemeticians trying to decipher what they believe are messages from extraterrestrials, and the crazy ""adventures"" they have in the process. There are lots of great moments in this book, great humor, and the central message (the more we learn, the less we know) is very cleverly displayed in true DeLillo fashion. However, the writing is so confusing and dense in most places that it hardly seems worth it except for the truly dedicated DeLillo fan."
4,Horizon Fitness EX33 Dual Action Elliptical Trainer,"Overall, I am pleased with this machine. The directions, for the most part, were very clear, and I was able to assemble on my own (female,>60). Several of the plastic covers did not fit particularly well but did not affect the basic function. The machine seems very substantial and I believe is of good quality. One caveat--- I would check and compare prices carefully. Amazon's ad claimed the machine is normally $999.00 and the selling price was $599.00. Now that I have the machine, I have checked many ads and see that the even higher Horizon model numbers can be found for well under $1000. In other words, not so sure that I did particularly well price-wise."
3,Good deal for the price,"I bought this elliptical machine about 2 months ago. I put it together myself and it took me almost 3 hours; the set up was simple until I got to the part where you put the peddles on, I could have used an extra hand at that point. It is not loud; I do not have to put the volume up on my TV but it does make noises and rocks slightly. I am 5'9"" and I do find the handles far out of reach; they should have been made to be closer to your body. I get an excellent work on on resistance level one, but I notice that one pedal seems to have more resistance than the other (anyone come across this problem and have any idea how to fix it?). Overall, for the price it is a great buy. The machine is sturdy, quiet, and gets you sweating. I would have given it 5 stars if the arms could be adjusted and if I could figure out why one side seems to have more resistance than the other."
2,confusion,"the directions are too complicated, my daughter is now three, i have another baby and still can't figue it out."
2,Will be returning,"I registered for this since we live in a two-story house and I thought that it would save me from having to go downstairs in the middle of the night. The 8 oz. Dr. Brown's bottles do not fit in the cooler section. This is a waste as I would need to have 2 items set up, one to keep bottles cool and one to heat. I will be returning this disappointing item."
1,GARBAGE!!!..........AND DANGEROUS!!!!!!!,"How convenient of this product, to have a nice unit like this to keep on your nite-table so when your baby is hungry in the middle of the night you can have a bottle explode on you and formula go all over your room.... and your baby!!!! We used this product exactly as it directs in the manual. How can they make such a dangerous product,""especially for babies""(as it's called). When it DID work before, it was very inconsistant. What is the purpose of this? To one day burn a hole in my baby's mouth?"
5,"Works great, but didn't really need it","I breastfeed and supplement with forumula. The product works great. However, if you just give your baby room temperature bottles, that's what she'll get used to. I guess the baby just gets used to whatever it knows. My daughter is used to formula at room temperature and this has been just fine for us!"
3,Functional,It works fast & great but we didn't use it beyond 2 months. Wouldn't spend money on it unless you're storing breastmilk to use later.
3,Pretty Good,"I loved this bottle warmer if there were a couple of changes. It makes things so much easier at night and early in the morning. However, The cooler did not fit the tall Dr Brown bottles and I wish the cooler could fit at least 3 bottles"
1,Heating element burning off!,"We've found with our unit that the heating element at the bottom of the burner is disintegrating and turns the water brown! The bottles end up smelling like they've burnt and the brown yucky water coats the outside of the bottles. Perhaps we've been using it incorrectly, but we are very dissatisfied with it."
4,The separate cooler is the best part,"I found that this warmer is not a bad investment. It is difficult to determine the right amount of water to add. Especially if you are using different types of bottles with different types of plastic. But I guess that would be the problem with any warmer. I love the fact that the cooler is separate from the base. Each night I put it all in the cooler and take it upstairs, then each morning I put it all back in and carry it all downstairs."
1,Don't waste your money,In my opinion this product is a total waste of money. It is impossible to figure out the right amount of water to use because it is inconsistent from one time to the next. I will finally think I have it figured out and then the bottle will come out either too hot or too cold the next time. I bought this product to try to save time but it usually ends up taking even longer. Either the bottle comes out too cold and I have to warm it up longer (and constantly check it to make sure it doesn't get too hot)or it comes out too hot and I have to cool it down. It is not much fun to deal with this while trying to calm a fussy baby. I have found that it is much easier and quicker just to use hot tap water.
2,I am still waiting for my bottle to warm!!!!!,"I did not have much luck with this warmer. I purchased this warmer because I liked the idea of storing the bottles in my bedrrom opposed to having to go downstairs in the middle of the night to retrieve a bottle from the fridge, but the warmer is ineffective.The warmer is built to carry an ice pack and two bottles in its cooler. The idea is when the baby wakes in the middle of the night you can just go to the warmer, pull out a bottle from its cooler, add water to the warmer, and warm the bottle. The thing is, the bottle does not warm effectively. I was using the bottles with the bags. The bottles took so long to heat. Then the warmer would cut off and my bottle would still be cold. So I would have to run to the bathroom and place the bottle under the hot water faucet to continue heating."
3,Okay but save your money,Bottle warmers are items you can do without. Using a cup of warm water works just as well. For all the new parents out there just save your money for the diapers you will REALLY need!This was adequate nothing to rave about.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This warmer heats the bottles well. However most of the bottles I have heated have leaked into the warmer. We have wasted a lot of valuable breast milk with this machine. I have tried different types of bottles with different amounts of milk and they still leak
3,Too long to warm up,I received this product at my baby shower. I thought it was great but after a while my baby would be crying for a bottle and it would take forever to heat up. it was a lot easier using the microwave to heat up the bottles so now my warmer is put away and it never gets used anymore. I did use it on a long trip accross the U.S. with my 2 month old and it worked great in the car. A lot better than those warmers they sell especially for the car that wraps around the bottle with a plastic band. We attached the bottle warmer to a converter inside the car. It still took long to warm up the bottle but its better than nothing when you're out in the middle of nowhere. The brown water on the bottom of the bottle warmer is a little disgusting. its just a lot easier to just warm up the bottle in the microwave or on the stove top.
2,"Warms bottle, but unpredictable!","This product does a great job of warming your babies' bottle, but it is very, very inconsistent. My wife and I have tried to experiment with it several times under exactly the same circumstances, with the bottle coming out at extrememly different temperatures each time. If the bottle is too hot, you have to cool it down (eliminating the time savings of having a bottle warmer), and if it doesn't heat it suffciently, the instructions state that you must wait 15 minutes to use the warmer again! Good for people who have to go downstairs at night to get\warm a bottle; for others, I question its' usefulness."
2,"Too big, too much guess work, broken....","This does save time and some of the guesswork out of warming bottles, but I have to say that I'm a little disappointed with the quality of the product. Like others that have reviewed this product we have had problem with the water turning brown and burning so we have to clean it out several times a month. Also, the top to the little blue vial has broken off so we can store water in it. Finally, the bottom of the tray that the bottle sits in has completely broken off and I can't find any way to get a replacement for it.I have also let the bottle get too warm sometimes and have had to deal with my baby getting over a burnt mouth (i have tried cooling the bottle down but it takes forever and my son would much rather have a too warm bottle than wait).I do have one good comment. I don't know why others have said that the large Avent bottles don't fit. Mine fit fine. Perhaps they didn't take out the insert for thinner bottles?"
4,Pretty good,"This warmer seems to do the trick. It does take a long time but it consistantly keeps the right temp if you follow the directions carefully. I have not had the problems the other reviews state. My basket has not burned. I love the removable ring to accomadate different size bottles. I like that you can keep it plugged in and that it has a removable carrying case that has a freezer pak in it. Overall, a great product."
4,Great convenience - Not too sturdy,"I have to say that this is probably the best item we purchased for our new baby. It keeps me in bed for those late night feedings so I don't have to go downstairs to warm a bottle, and then I can get right back to sleep. However, the cooler is quite cheaply made. I accidentally dropped the lid from about 3 feet up and it cracked wide open. A little duct tape did the trick, but it could have been made more sturdy. Still very glad I bought this though"
2,A Waste,"I really wasted my money on this product. I can never get the bottle heated just right. The bottle is either tooooooo cold or tooooooooo hot. I tried pouring half of the the little blue tube in for a four ounce bottle it's too cold. I tried the entire tube it's very very hot. I would preferr to warm the bottle in a pot than to put up with this thing. I thought maybe it's just me--my husband has a hard time as well,it's always too hot. In the mean time my daughter is screaming for a warm bottle. Please do not waste your money on this product."
1,Very Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with this bottle warmer. I bought it after reading everything about it. It also has great reviews, BUT you cannot use bottle liners in it. I had to find out the hard way by buying it, getting it home, setting it up, then reading the small print on the directions that say no bottle liners because the may melt or make the milk too hot. Please keep this in mind when deciding what to buy. I wish someone had saved me the trouble and money."
3,confusing warmer,"this item has me all confused. everytime i warm a bottle it is either too hot, cold, or ok. i always do the exact same thing as when i get it good but it will come out hot or cold. and i've just had it for a week and the thermal cooler broke. i am pretty disappointed and am considering buying the avent express bottle warmer.p.s. the cord is way too short"
1,Have never even used,"We tried this product out before the baby was born and the water never even warmed up. When we put a bottle in we had to leave it in so long and put it back in, it never warmed up. By the time our baby was born this product was back in the box in the closet. If I could find my receipt it would have been returned. Much easier just to warm the bottle in the sink with warm water."
1,Lame!,"Don't buy this-it steams the bottle so hot that you think it's going to melt, the basket that you put the bottle in isn't big enough for wide bottles, only standard slim ones, if you don't scold yourself trying to get the bottle out, you probably will when you test the milk-beware. I wish I saved my money, now I just use warm tapwater instead, works like a champ!"
1,Cold milk every time!,"This product is overpriced for what it is suppose to do. I had to adjust the amount of water to use because it doesn't work as the directions state. I even tried warming up the bottle twice in a row. Still had cold milk. It did manage to heat up the outside of the bottle, but still having ice cold milk inside just wasted my time, especially when you have a screaming hungry baby!"
2,Doesn't warm consistently,"This bottle warmer does not heat the bottles consistently. We always use the same bottles, always with 8 oz of formula, but sometimes the bottle heats to just the right temperature, while other times it is too cold or too hot. Also, the regular, 8-oz size Dr. Brown's bottles are too tall for the cooling unit. Although it works okay most of the time, don't waste your money on it. I am disappointed with it."
5,great product!,"This bottle warmer works great for breast milk. The water does not turn brown if you FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS (other reviewers had trouble with this). The ""cooler"" feature is great for those middle of the night feedings. My husband can now share in the joy of a 3 am wake up call and give me a much needed break once in a while."
3,Good Bottle Warmer ~~ But...,"This bottle warmer was easy to use. I used one water container for a small bottle and 2 for teh larger bottles. The bottles were usually perfectly warm for the baby. However, I didn't start using this warmer until August when I finished breast feeding and it died this week. So I only got about 6 months of use from it. [...]"
4,Great - But 1 Small Problem,"We have been using this warmer & Dr. Browns 8oz. bottles with no problem. Unit works great. The only problem is that after only 2 months of use, the warmer is very rusty and smells like rust when heating. It doesn't bother the baby, but I'd rather not have to clean the unit of rust. It would make an otherwise excellent product to be outstanding if they would make the heater stainless steel so it wouldn't rust!"
5,Too good to be true!!!,"This bottle warmer is the best out there. It has the cooling pack system to keep 2 bottles cold and then the warmer warms up, in about 5-10 seconds, This is a night light so you can see what you are doing. I would highly reccomend this warmer, I am a fussy parenta nd only want the best for my newborn."
1,Don't waste your money!! Auto-shut off does not work.,"This product is a total waste of money. The automatic shut-off does not work, so I had to constantly check to see if the bottle was warm. I exchanged it for a different one thinking maybe I had a defective warmer, but it still did not work."
4,Great for night feedings,"This was a lifesaver during our night feedings, especially with cold breast milk. We took it upstairs into the baby's room and were able to warm a bottle in the time it took to change a diaper. The cooler was great too. We didnt need to run downstairs to get the milk out of the fridge for every feeding. The night light was a nice added feature, but we only wished it was brighter."
4,works just fine,"This product was a godsend at night. Instead of getting up in the middle of the night to warm the bottle while you have a screaming baby waiting, we have this product. I did not use it w/ 4oz. I started using it w/ 5 - 6oz. of milk in the bottle. It worked perfect. The Avent bottles do fit. The blue container that keeps the water frozen sometimes lead you wrong. You have to squeeze the bottles on the side..try it..watch it fit. I am currently still using it for my 5mth old in case she doesn't sleep through the night."
2,There are better options,"We tried every bottle warmer on the market and truth be told, they all worked inconsistently. We struggled night after night to get the bottles right until we figured out THE EASIEST way to do bottles of formula.We stopped using liquid formula, that needed to be chilled and then warmed, and instead went with powder. Here is what we did:- Measure out your powdered formula into a formula keeper.- Fill your bottles with the proper amount of water.- When the baby wakes up just open the bottle top, pour in the powder and stir it with a formula stir.Easy... Easy... Easy!!Bottles can be served room temperature and you never have to worry about burning the formula, burning your baby, waiting for formula to cool, formula spills, etc.It worked amazingly well for us and I wish we had done it from the beginning!!As for breastmilk, that's a different story but for formula feeders, this is the only way to go."
2,Some good and bad points,"the good points: it is convenient for nighttime feedings with the cooler and water containers. saves you from trips to the kitchen.the bad points: 1) heating element was not always consistant. once, i feel asleep waiting for the bottle to warm (the baby had gone back to sleep) and the heating element did not turn off. and the bottle was boiling!). 2) it always made the bottles leak from the nipple, and then the milk would burn on the heating element and the smell was awful, especially early in the morning. and it was annoying to clean. 3) i wish the cooler would lock into the unit so that you would use the cooler handle to carry the whole item. i only used it for less than two months.all in all, i would not purchase this item again. i would recommend using a good bottle warmer and just use a cooler you already have to store bottles."
1,Not happy at all!!!,"The cooling unit does not keep two bottles cold enough for eight hours. Only after two months of use a hole formed in the ice pack. Also, you have to figure out how much water goes into the water holder or the bottle will over heat. I was not very happy with this warmer."
4,Good product,"For those of us that were physically and medically unable to breastfeed, this is a very helpful product. It's a good bottle warmer, it just takes a little longer to warm a bottle in this one then in some of different brands (the Night & Day bottle warmer by The First Years is much faster). Still works great, though.Sometimes bottle feeding isn't as easy as some people seem to think, so products like this are very helpful."
2,It is a waste of money,We have not had much luck with the warmer. The warmer either warms the bottle too much or not enough. It also boils some bottles over into the well and it is a pain to clean. It is better then having to boil a pan of water and safer then the microwave. We just have to basically stand over it and keep checking the bottle to make sure it is not too hot.
1,Do not buy this item,"While I found having a bottle warmer in our 2nd floor nursery to be invaluable, this particular one is not the one to buy. We only used the heating component as we had a mini fridge (tabletop size) for bottles for our twins. THe problem is that it has no way to alter the amount of water depending on the amount of milk you want to heat up. As a result, it is very easy to overheat the milk and that is incredibly frustrating after you have been bouncing your baby while waiting to heat up the milk. The amount of water in the little container is only sufficient for an 8 oz bottle and my kids still don't drink 8 oz at one time at 5 months of age nor do they need bottles at night anymore."
4,wish cooler was larger,I love this bottle warmer but I use Dr. Brown's bottles and the 8 oz bottles ane the wide neck bottles don't fit in the cooler so we still have to go into the kitchen at night to get the bottles. It has an automatic shut off switch but until the warmer completely cools the bottle is still receiving heat. Besides that it is great.
3,Good and not-so-good,"Pros:1. night lamp2. warms bottle!3. auto-off feature4. cooler to keep bottles cool when not in use5. can also be used as facial spa!cons:1. can't predict how warm the bottle is. sometimes it over-does the job2. though has the auto-off feature, never got to that stage. always had to remove the bottle because it was getting too hot.3. short cord4. large size"
4,good resource,"450 knitting stitches provides a very good resource of different knitting stitches. Color photos of samples of each pattern clearly show what the stitch should look like. The book is divided into sections: knit and purl patterns, ribbings, cables, all-over laces and lace panels. I have found it very useful for decorative stitches for hats, scarves and washcloths (I'm not yet up to designing my own sweater, but there are several stitches here that would look great in a sweater). The number of stitches in the pattern repeat is right at the top of each pattern, which makes looking for specific repeat number very easy. There are no charts, only written directions, but they are very clear."
4,Great for moderate beginners,"I ordered this book after learning a few basic stiches and making a few moderately difficult projects with help from an instructor. I give this book a great rating because it has given me an abundance of ideas for various projects. However there are a few drawbacks: one is the illustrations of creating a stitch aren't quite clear (in any book for that matter) and a beginner may need someone to actually demonstrate a stitch in order to fully understand the descriptions and illustrations; secondly, some of the abbreviations do not seem universal to other pattern books I have, thus causing confusion. On the other hand though, some of the other explanations and illustrations are easy to understand. Overall, I think it's a great book; I highly recommend it."
4,"Terrific addition to a stitching library-easy to read, lots of suggestions","I have already begun using this simple collection of stitches. I love how the editors have combined stitches with colors to show varieties. I was getting tired of my old book of stitches, so the selection is wonderful. Easy to follow patterns, and basic information, too."
4,"review for 450 knitting stitches, vol. 2","This book had a good collection of stitches including lace stitches, cables, and other stitches. As other reviewers mentioned, they sometimes used abbreviations that were different from what is more commonly seen. It wasn't that difficult to find out what they were, so I wasn't really bothered by it."
5,A Good Tool,"Great reference book if you like to make up your own designs, make swatches of stitches or just learn stitches and abbreviations. I use it all the time.The pictures are good also, but the only drawback to all these books is that they do not show the reverse side of the stitch and therefore, I have to knit each one to see if I like the other side when knitting scarves or other reversible items. Finally, I have a great reversible scarf going for my husband, using 4 different stitches.A really good purchase."
2,Where was the romance?,"I did not enjoy this book very much because the relationship between the heroine and the hero did not 'develop', or at least, I did not see it develop. One moment you find the characters very intimate, and the next minute they are total strangers. And then, at the end of the story, they 'discover' they fell in love with each other. Quite briefly, there was very little emotion in the story."
3,"Eh, so-so . . .","This is an okay book. I don't know why this is a separate book from ""Badges and Insignias of the Third Reich."" I didn't like the format. I was disappointed."
1,Pass this one up for now.,"The bulk of most self-published books, aka vanity press, end up being given away to friends, neighbors and, perhaps in this case, to potential clients. The book is simple, easy-to-read and well written, basically a primer. It is, however, a rather tedious rehash of the literature on asset allocation available free from various web sites.I've read most of the asset allocation books available from Amazon. This book pales in comparison to Bernstein, Swedroe and Gibson in both style and content. If you have unlimited funds and time, certainly add Frush to your collection. But before you do that, select any of the above mentioned well-known authors for more interesting in-depth coverage of asset allocation."
1,Not for me,"I was very disappointed in this movie, but then I am of the wrong generation for it. Perhaps a younger person might find it interesting. I did not."
5,Chrome Sonic Whistle with Black Lanyard,Great whistle. It will get your attention. It was shipped fast and it works great. It is nice looking and can be used for varies things.
3,"Great whistle, shippping not so great","Very loud and quality made. Easy to use, did not give 5 stars because shipping was way to much."
3,Not a 'guide to wine',"This book is an encouragement to enjoy wine without intimidation or snobbery. That's a good thing. It isn't really a guide, though; it's a compilation of their wine-friendly articles from the WSJ, not in any way a reference work. Don't buy this as a reference work."
3,not that happy,"the track I wanted.................""Birth of the Blues"" is actually a different song altogether.............""Learnin' the Blues. and the last track is also not the one written on the cover and the disc.Not happy about this!"
3,Drug and Alcohol Abuse: A Clinical Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment,This book has been of great help with my preparation for taking the test to become a LAC (Licensed Addiction Counselor)
5,Clever and substantive,"I base my comments on Edition 3, not 4. The book was funny, substantive, humble, and comprehensive. The organization was effective, and I learned how much knowledge about persuasion has changed since twenty years ago, the last time I taught a course on that subject. If I had to start over to learn about persuasion, this was an excellent way to do it!"
4,Alright,"It's about par with every other persuasion text. Nothing spectacular about it. Don't buy unless you have. I give it 4 stars because as text books go, it's an easy read. If you're looking for your own interest in persuasion, read influence."
4,great movie,"It was a twisted plot, complex characters and a thriller.The movie unfold slowly and it has a semi good ending. A must watch."
4,Hardcore suspense!,"Italian language movie with subtitles. This movie is in the genre of Alfred Hitchcock movies. Suspense and suprises throughout the movie. There are a lot of nude and sexually explicit scenes so may not be suitable for children, but definetly a movie to watch if you like suspense."
4,good ideas,I bought it for a son - he put much of it to good use.Good reference material for projects.
2,Wrong Book,"This book is Black & Whitealso be sure you want the PHOTOSHOP 6book , not PHOTOSHOP ELEMENTS 6."
5,Fantastic Knives Great Price,"I researched alot of knife sets. They are expensive, so I wanted to get the most for my money. I read an article where chefs rated different knives. Some of the chefs said they liked the Victorinox better than the expensive brands. They also said that these knives seemed to be designed for professional chefs. I had already bought a different set, but when I saw this review I took them back and ordered the Victorinox. I wasn't disappointed. I got the best knives and saved a fortune. If you order these, get the steak knives too. They cut meat like butter!"
3,average knifes.not as heavy steel as the single i had purchased earlier,"not bad set ,but i had bought the set with the knowledge of the product but i had already purchased a knife from a chefs store and that knife was of heavier gauge yet still the same stock number? go figure,also the block was not the same as on the outside of the box. kinda disappointing since i have a long and proud swiss heritage"
4,Nice package of the RCA years,Not bad. The RCA years were the middle period of the Kinks. This CD offers the best tunes of that period.
1,"This is not the ""original issue remastered""","This says that it is the original recording remastered but there is nothing at all similar to the original recording. This sux. I am so sick of the record companies remastering everything three or four times, with different cuts, and repetitive songs! They can blow it on this one!"
3,Get the Japanese equivalent!,"I just want to let everyone know that there is a 2001 Japanese release (which is still available, although kinda hard to find) that covers this period of the Kinks music much better, and works better as an expanded version of the original CELLULOID HEROES. It's called THE GREATESET HITS II 1971-75 (the price is about $30), and looking over the track listing you'll see it's just about definitive:1> Sweet Lady Genevieve; 2> Everybody's A Star (mono mix); 3> Mirror Of Love; 4> Sitting In My Hotel; 5> 20th Century Man; 6> Sitting In The Midday Sun; 7> Holiday Romance; 8> Holiday; 9> Supersonic Rocketship; 10> One Of The Survivors (single edit); 11> Celluloid Heroes; 12> He's Evil; 13> Alchohol (studio version); 14> Ducks On The Wall; 15> You Don't Know My Name; 16> The Hard Way; 17> Look A Little On The Sunny Side; 18> No More Looking Back; 19> Muswell Hillbilly; 20> You Can't Stop The MusicIt's become of my favorite Kinks CDs..."
2,What a bummer,"The live version of Here Comes Yet Another Day and the American remix of Starmaker appear to be absent here, unless I'm missing something. The whole draw of the original Celluloid Heroes album for me were these two track. Count me as one disappointed fan. If you must, this is a decent a sampler from the second, weaker, period Kinks, so be it. Otherwise avoid. Personal to Ray: This one stings, friend."
2,deleted songs,"while the additions to this cd are great, why did they ommit the faster live version of ""here comes another day"" and the speeded-up version of ""starmaker"". ray davies said in an interview he always thought starmaker should have been faster. now these versions of the songs are completely deleted from the kinks catalog as they were only available on the original version of this compilation. it dont make sense. also, they had a minor hit with ""no more looking back"" on the ""schoolboys"" album. thats not on here either."
3,Baby not interested as yet,My son is 7mths and not interested in sippy cup as yet. Nipple is a little hard. He prefers soft nipples.
1,milk collects in spout,After coming out of the dishwasher I squeazed the spout to get out the excess water (or so I thought...) sour spoiled milk squirted out that collected in the under side of the spout. I had to throw it away. I only used it 3 times! It is a bummer because I like the overall design of the cup with the handles.
3,Not bad cups,"These cups aren't bad to use. We use them now without the handles as I found them pretty pointless for an older baby. It has a valve but it was very difficult to suck. So I took them out to make it easier for my child. Of course, without the valve, it's pretty much like a watering can...easy to pour out. I don't fault Avent for that at all, as that's my choice. But, it does leak along the sides and there's an aeration vent/hole near the top of the rubber spout part that always leaks when my son tilts the cup back. I like the lid, though it doesn't contain all the liquid that is spilled, but some times the lid is really difficult to take off. I use this most when we go out to eat, but will bring a water tight container to carry the milk in instead of putting it in the cup itself."
1,Water Damage,"These cups are terrible. Every time my baby drops them, they start to leak from the loosening caused by the often minor jolt (I removed the handles, but still have the same result). When he drinks out of them, they squirt water up his nose, he doesn't like this. They leak in the diaper bag from loosening when lightly jostled. I have sections of floor that have been damaged by huge puddles left by these cups when I didn't notice a slow leak after baby left them on the floor. A fine product in the upright position for babies who do not drop or throw things and who do not mind water squirted into eyes and up the nose.Just to clarify, the leaking is not at the sippy spout, it is at the point where the cup is screwed together, the spout works fine (I also have 6 of them, all of them leak). I have replaced all of my Avent sippy cups with Tommee Tippee and we really like those. I bought Avent because they are made in England and we liked their pacifiers, but this product is awful."
4,"nothing wrong with the spouts,,,",dont trust the other reviewers concerning the spouts. there is a flexible plastic sealing disk on the underside of the spout that you remove for cleaning and put back on for use. its the magic in the magic spout--it flexes to let fluid out of the spout and air out of the vent hole. hard to believe these people have children yet they cant figure out how to clean the spout properly!
5,Delightful film!,"I love this film! These are true, heartfelt stories of love that are powerful. Film maker Drew Emery does a masterful job at setting up the interviews, weaving details in and out; you don't really know who's paired with whom for awhile, and it's delightful to see how it all comes out. While the film is a powerful call for marriage equality, it's not just about that; it's about love. The film is especially fun to watch with a crowd; the funny stuff (and there's a lot of it!) is even funnier with a crowd. Delightful film!"
1,garbage,There is nothing I hate more than a cover that that has nothing to do with the movie. This is trash. Avoid at all costs. I would rate this movie as one of the worst that I have ever seen. There is no redeeming value and my dog could have shot a better movie.
1,fake hype fake movie fake everything,"ok so those other reviews of this movie are fake most likey writen by the director since he does have a lot of time on his hands.. maybe trying to find a different actress to have sexual contact with on camara and sell it to idiot's!! seriously how the hell can someone like this but hate a movie like DOOM GENERATION>?? are you smoking crack!!! how does anyone say this is orignal??? Movies like this make me want to shot people who give it a 5? your not so post to like this... its so post to be distrubing? I DON""T BUY THAT there is plenty of movies out there that YOur sopost to hate the killers. that are plenty distrubing.... someone please for the love of god give the people that gave this movie a 5 and give them a copy of NOWHERE or DOOM GENERATION !!!!"
1,Shane Ryan,"The most stupid and silliest movie I have ever purchased, I didn't send back even though the movie title and graphics on the cover have nothing to do with the movie. Its just one of those stupid things sometime everyone buys."
1,Trash.,"After viewing trash such as this, I wonder what goes on in the heads of people who watch this and enjoy it. Do they hate women, or do they really hate themselves so much that it brings them happiness to watch someone suffer? I cannot give this ""film"" any stars at all. There is nothing noteworthy about it. There is no art or actual social commentary present in the 71 minutes of hell that is on this DVD. Anyone, and I mean ANYONE, could have made this. Amateur Porn Star Killer is a slap in the face to women and the entire horror genre. When garbage like this is released, it's no wonder why people don't take horror and shot-on-video movies seriously."
5,Galveston oh Galveston,"It is nothing short of amazing that a city of 60,000 can have an architecture guide book this extensive written about it. Having said that, this is a wonderful guide. It hits every major area and is section quite nicely. It is perfect to take along as you visit this unique city. When I first picked this book up I didn't know what to expect, I was blown away at how extensive it was. I recommend this to anyone who's going to visit Galveston or who quite frankly just loves historic architecture. Galveston deserved a book like this and as someone who loves Galveston, I want to personally thank Ellen Beasley for this book."
5,A Must for Visit to Galveston,"Few smaller cities in America have been fortunate enough to have a guide like this created for them. Filled wirh great photographs and succinct histories, this architectural collection is invaulable for any visitor to Galveston or simply an admirer of architecture. For a more in depth look try ""Clayton's Galveston""."
5,WISH IT WAS 1967 forever,"Great historical and musical snapshot of a GREAT YEAR,! England's answer to Human Be In. Video really captures the event with Pink Floyd."
3,"lovely voice, nice texts, but...","Her voice is gourgeous, and the music nice to listen to, and relax, but somehow it's like listening to the same three songs, not much variety, that's a shame. But still, a nice cd, but don't expect rocket science."
1,Not what you expect,I was very disappointed to pay...for this book which is basically a collection of essays and articles most of which have already been published by this guru of C.A.L.L. Less than half of the collection deal with computers and language learning. I was expecting a teacher resource manual for using C.A.L.L. in the classroom. The only way I will get my money's worth is if the publisher sends the free software promised on the cover.
5,Great book!,"This book is a rational and well written investigation into the causes and cures for office politics. In particular, the author understands that everyone acts selfishly and goes on to explain how various policies either align people's interests with their companies' or turn them against each other. Among its many highlights are five real examples in the form of five people who had acted very politically, then been educated about the causes and cures of office politics, and finally asked to re-evaluate their actions. One of the surprising, and fortunate, discoveries of that was that 'political operators' generally tend to dislike honest environments as much as honest people dislike political environments. Another positive was a section entitled 'The Rule of Law, Not Man' which explains that topic well. Finally, there are some good quotes in the chapter headings such as 'conviction is worthless unless it is converted into conduct' attributed to Thomas Carlyle."
4,The End of Office Politics as Usual,"While the strategic steps seem initially complex, they are very logical and lead to a positive conclusion: creating a merit-based work environment to replace a culture driven by political infighting and posturing. In the end, the company, the employees and the shareholders all benefit. It is a worthwhile read for anyone in business -- especially those who pursue the executive ranks."
3,"Interesting Info, Hard to Read at Times","Sewing Circles of Herat contained a lot of interesting information. My problem with this book was wading thru all the information to get anything from it. There was a lot of jumping from what was 'present day' to a 5 page history lesson and back. There were also a lot of names that were very hard to keep track of. If you can get thru all of this and pull out the information you should take from it. When starting this book, I knew very little about Afghanistan, and I learned what a beautiful country it was in the past and how things changed within the past 20 years and are changing even more in recent days."
5,Love it!,"Brilliant! This is an incredible work book, to help you on you way to health and happiness, simple and to the point. Helps you to get in touch with yourself and learn what your body needs! A must have for anyone that wants to live a healthy life!"
5,Lewis and Clark - Shaping of the West - Book,Book came in timly manner as described. Would buy again.
2,Disappointing,"Like many comic book fans familiar with comic book writer Garth Ennis collaborations with illustrator Steve Dillon, like John Constantine: Hellblazer, Preacher, or Goddess (an underrated graphic novel illustrated by Phil Winslade - I wish they'd reissue this one); I was really looking forward to this project. It promised to be a look at the dark side of the US Army's secret operations over an extended period of cold war history, told with Ennis trademark black humor and insight. But Unknown Soldier suffered from severe gaps in logic, in particular in the motivations and actions of its hero, the CIA agent who begins a hunt for the legendary Army Intelligence operative, the Unknown Soldier, and for me at least, was a disappointing read. Still, the Tim Bradstreet covers are excellent and are worth a peek, but other than that I can't recommend this collection."
3,Interesting plot - rushed ending,"An updating of the old 1960's and 70's series. Proves you can't trust the CIA and other lettered agencies. But the ending just left me cold - felt rushed and slightly incoherent. Good moody art that fit the overall feel of the story. Overall, an ok book but not Garth's best"
3,"Lots of action, still prefer original","The movie has a lot of action and neat effects. I have to say that, in a matter of opinion, the original has a better story line."
2,Never should have remade this movie,don't bother unless holed up due to a blizzard or there is absolutely no other movie to watch. Would not recommend
2,Total Recall 2012,The original was set on Mars and had a more interesting story line. While the special effects in this movie were OK they ruined the story line. The first movie was far superior to this poor remake.
1,horrible,Nothing like the original which I wouldn't mind except this movie is soooo bad! The acting is horrible..the direction is lacking.....it is very boring a true waste of time
1,Not worth the $$$,"I ""heart"" amazon streaming but....there are a LOT of movies like this one that should be 50 cent streaming rentals on day one...can't figure why the FTC doesn't get after amazon's crazy streaming pricing for movies that really should be under a dollar rentals...how does pricing for flops compete with redbox? Seems a little ""non market based control of pricing"" if you ask me. Just my 2 centimes...I know studios need support for greenlighting stinkfests like this...CA needs jobs too :-) but jiminies..."
4,Good movie!,"Move kept me engaged, some of it was a spin off the original. Overall it was better than I thought"
2,Worse than the first.,"The good things about this movie have nothing to do with the original. I liked the geopolitical environment. Appreciated the message such an environment was trying to convey. But beyond that, I was just disappointed.MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD...To me one of the cool things about the first one was that it took place on Mars, this one doesn't.Secondly, and I don't think this is too nit picky. What affect would drilling a hole through the center of the earth actually have? I'm no geologist and the first thing that comes to mind is ""REALLY BAD IDEA"". And if it is ok to do so they could have addressed in even the most minor way. Cause I'm sure I was not the only non-geologist/earth science person watching this.I could go on. But I won't."
2,Meh,"A visually stunning CG world and a stellar line up of great actors just weren't enough to save this clunker of a remake. All in all, a so-so re-imagining of the original with a surprisingly tame and seemingly sudden ending."
2,Can not get through this!,"Liked original but this....just can not get through it. Have started it several times and seems like all action and no plot. If you do not know the first one, not sure you going to get this one and I found special effects a bit weak. Watch the orginal and skip this one."
2,Somewhat interesting scenery but boring plot I've seen 100 times before,"This was a real waste of a movie. While I understand it is a remake, nothing about this movie was original or unique. Every element of the plot, the technology and ""sci-fi"" elements are all from many movies before it. Regular 9mm guns from CSI? Really I want to watch them shoot the same guns as real life from the 70's? That is not sci-fi. Pretty boring I can't recommend watching it especially if you have to pay for it. The sci-fi scenery makes for about 20 minutes of interesting viewing, but that is the only plus side to the movie."
2,Slow paced,"In my honest opinion, the pace was slow, even for an ""Action"" movie. I found myself having to re-watch scenes because I fell asleep."
3,It was a different Total Recall...,"I guess what one recalls is up to the one who recalls it, this movie had similarities to the original one, but the story line was different. It was well done, but I think I liked the original story line more."
2,It was there.,"This movie wasn't what it was made out to be, hard to follow. Tried to watch it twice with my son and I fell asleep both times and he didn't care for it ."
3,Good,"This was a good movie, not great but much better than I thought it would be. The special effects were pretty cool."
3,Awesome female villain was worth it,A little long to get to the resistance part of movie but I liked the remake and the visual chase was very good. Kate was worth it.
3,need more,"it was good and the plot was almost like the original movie. I did not like that they cut some scenes from the original and I understand that is a budget thing, but they could at least made it a little more exicting/dificult the discovery of the stronghold."
4,Total Recall,The action was good and the acting was okay. There was more acting in the original TR. Digital action was very good.
3,Orignal movie better.,"Like most remakes, the original was better. Special effects were very good. The problem was that there wasn't enough story to support the special effects."
4,Much better than I expected.,"Did not seem like a movie I would want to watch, but hubby wanted to so I did. It was actually really good. Watched the original a few days later. Like this one better than the original."
3,Very similar to old movie,"Watched this at a recommendation of a friend and found it pretty much like the old movie, it was a good action flick but no better than the original, just updated with a Blade Runner type feel."
4,Total Recall as exciting as the original film,"Total Recall is more than a remake of the original film, it's an engaging new story based on the central premise of the original story: manufactured dreams and memories. Moving the focus from Mars to a post-war Earth allows the writers to intertwine current day concerns about violence and war. The story connects much better with the viewer. The action scenes are excellent but tedious – they could be shorter or fewer without losing effect. The ending is classic and enigmatic."
2,I don't htink they should have called it Total Recall,"I expected Mars, a conjoined twin and more of a clear story line. This was nothing like the original except for the concept of the double double agent and the names of the characters.I was confused at best about what ""topside"" was and why it seemed they traveled through the earth's core."
2,Only Worth $0 Rental,I would recommend this movie to those who want to see a horrible movie that despite the overdone action scenes still lulls you to sleep.
5,Awesome movie. Worth the watch,"Great movie, loved it! I will be watching it a second time. Now I Have to type more words to be able to submit the review."
2,Bad storyline,Totally disjointed storyline but pretty good special effects. Never knew where they were going with the storyline.I'm glad I didn't spend the money at the movies to see this film.
3,Disappointing and more,The movie was not great but it was watchable. I think I expected more since I liked the idea behind the movie. I loved the original but I was twelve when I saw it.
1,Weak,The first one was better This one had a stupid plot and weak actors. the main female actor was Hot!
2,Politically motivated remake of a classic,"In the future we have destroyed our planet... But somehow managed to figure out a way to drill and travel through it. I get it. It is a science-fiction movie, allowances need to be made. But, when Quaid opens his safety deposit box, he finds stacks of currency waiting for him, WITH OBAMA'S FACE ON IT! This is supposedly a future where America doesn't even survive, and we are to believe that somehow President Obama has made such an impact on the world, that his face is used on foreign currency centuries later. What a stretch even for Hollywood liberals."
2,Very disappointing!,"Some 20 years (??) after the original and with all the technological and CGI advances, I was so looking forward to the update of this movie. I really enjoyed the one with Arnold Swarzeneggar and Sharon Stone, but what a colossal disappointment. This movie was not an improvement. In fact, it was terrible. The plot and interactions between the characters are never really developed and the whole movie just ends up being one big chase scene between Colin and Kate (ho hum) with a couple minutes of the other actors thrown in for some variety, I guess. If you liked the original... rent it again and don't bother with this tripe. I can't even say the special effects were any better than the original, so what does that tell you?"
2,2/5 stars.,"The movie was not original, I felt like I was watching Jason Bourne all over again, but he wasn't as clever. The movie was very predictable and they didn't do as much with the storyline as they could have. Had a lot of potential, didn't work out very well."
3,Watchable...But,"The acting was a bit poor, once you get past that, and being a tech nerd, it was rather interesting to see."
3,Not as good as the first,Great movie that just didn't live up to the first but better acting than the first. Great special effects and better acting need to watch it but DON'T compare.
3,I had somewhat better expectation,"The idea was good, however it was quite different form the original total recall which was much better. Action was good, the story too simple and linear."
2,Just so-so.,"I was really excited about watching this one. I loved the first Total Recall and this having the benefit of the current CGI technology should have been awesome. It did have good special effects, but the story line and action scenes ended up getting really unbelievable and pretty absurd. Colin Farrell did an amazing job, but Kate Beckinsale (a favorite actress of mine from Underworld) was cheesy and annoying. If you can rent it for free then it may be worth your time to watch this movie, but it's not worth paying for at all."
3,The plot in the original was better.,The special effects were good but the overall plot of the original was better. I will say the way they moved people to the colony and back again was interesting.
4,"Great Action, Good Story","Total Recall is an excellent remake of the original movie. Great special effects, Good Story, and the movie is fast paced. Definitely worth renting. The character are good, the actors and actress play their parts well."
4,The original is a classic,The quality of this movie is awesome but the original is a camp classic. The ladies in this are captivating and Colin does a great job.
4,Action! Action,"Loved the special effects. Kate Beckinsale was wonderful, she went toe to toe with Colin Farrell. It had a great ending!"
3,Good action movie.,"It's a good action/scifi movie. Definitely worth renting, however it would not have been worth paying the high theater ticket price for this movie."
3,"This movie needed to ""get it's a** to Mars!""","Total Recall from 1990 was cheesy action done right. It took place mostly on Mars, had lots of bad lines (which makes them classic when said by Arnold), a huge and gory body count, mutants, a three breasted hooker and it had enough smarts to keep you guessing until the end.This 2012 version stays on this planet, has some good action, decent CGI and not a whole lot else worth remembering. Oh, it does have a brief shot of a three breasted chick, but that was done over two decades ago. Well, Kate Beckinsale looked good as the ""wife"" turned villain (the most memorable role in the film) and Jessica Biel looked yummy too, but that's to be expected. Colin Farrell doesn't do a bad job replacing Arnold, but he doesn't add a whole lot either.Worth a rental if you want mindless wall to wall action. You'll probably like it more if you have never seen the original."
1,it was dumb,it was one of the dumbes movies i ever seen no rime or reason for what bwas going on not worth the bmony
1,A TOTAL DISASTER!,Colin Farrel is one of the worst actors in the history of cinema. Every thing this guy is involved with is usually a flop. BORING. BORING. BORING. A TOTAL FLOP!
1,Watching a Drunk Rape victim attack a guy,"would be a more emotional and entertaining than this movie. The original is SO much better. This film has a different story line and should have had a different title. Many of the scenes were dark like a horror movie (because the director knew they weren't worth seeing)even with the lights out in a room dark. The closed captioning was on the top, bottom, and side, all over the place. I hope Blade Runner is not screwed like this flick, Transformers, Star Trek remakes were."
2,bad remake,This version has too much CG with little to no plot. Actors are hard to crittic as there is any plot/story to convey. The first with Arnie is accademy award material in comparison.
2,My Mistake. Can I get my money back?,"This remake proves that there are some ideas best left to the first edition. I only pray that no one thinks about re=making Blade Runner. I really do like the cast. I hope they fire their agents, however."
3,Decent Movie Worth the Watch,"This wasn't a great movie but was worth the watch. Plenty of action in this remake. I decided to rent this movie rather than buy because I knew it wasn't a ""keeper"". Worth the $3.99 and will keep you entertained for the 2 hours. Just don't expect a fantastic movie, because it wasn't. :-)"
3,TOTAL RECALL,TOO MUCH VIOLENCE. ESPECIALLY DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. SORRY I EVEN RENTED THIS MOVIE.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND TEENS.
3,Meh,"Total Recall is...meh. There's some good action to see and some fun to be had but there's also some pretty bad dialogue and a weak plot to get through. Farrell and Biel do pretty well with what they're given, but Cranston is extremely underutilized and I'm not sure how I feel about Kate Beckinsale's Terminator-esque attitude. The movie went through a lot of production woes so hopefully there's a more satisfying Director's Cut to be seen in the future."
2,Bad Copy,When remaking a movie it should be better than original without changing game plan.Half was nothing like original movie &hole thing bla.
3,Total Recall is an ok movie,"If you're expecting an action movie full of action, you won't be totally disappointed. Like Arnie's movie, it's based on the short story ""We can remember it for you wholesale"" but the overall problem is that it's a remake and other than the fact that this version isn't based on - or connect to - Mars, it's very predictable. Both leading women are pretty, Colin ain't ugly and you can mostly believe in their characters. Unfortunately, if you have also seen I Robot.... you can't tell where the book begins and other Science Fiction movies end. Also felt like Minority Report was another favorite of the director. Overall, give it 3 stars because it's an action movie, not a thoughtful film. :-)"
2,Not worth renting.,It did not live up to what I thought it would be. It was lacking in anything that made it stand out other than Colin Farrell.
2,Boring.,"It had none of the fun, campiness of the original and yet somehow still managed to not be straight enough to take it seriously. Fail on both attempts. And the special effects were not great. It was basically nothing but boring."
2,It was ok,"Definitely not as good as the original. However, I was glad it wasn't a complete mimic of the original. However, sometimes it's better to leave one enough alone. I didn't find this version to be entertaining and in fact it didn't keep my attention. It was filled with a lot of action scenes, so if you like a movie with a lot of action but hardly any story line, then this is the movie to rent. If you are like me and prefer a story line to be followed up with action, well don't waste your time."
2,High Hopes Dashed,"I am a great fan of Philip K. Dick's writing and I've found most of the film adaptations to be well written versions, especially Blade Runner and The Adjustment Bureau. I had hoped that this would be better than the earlier version of Total Recall, especially with the cast. Sadly, it was as disappointing as the Schwarzenegger version and the science perhaps just as bad.Colin Farrell tried, but the movie was choppy and either badly directed or edited. Either way, it was very disappointing."
2,not what I expected,The story was nothing like the original. It seems there were only a few scenes that were close to the old flick. Very disappointing. Collin Ferrel sub standard acting.....
5,Forget Arnold and the original and your set to enjoy a very entertaining film.,"Let's see, the original Total recall with Arnold released in 1990, 22 years ago. So, if you can resist the temptation to compare that film with the very loose adaption (at best) of the 2012 release, you might enjoy this excellent sci-fi film. Just think of it as a entirely different movie which coincidentally has the same title. INMHO, the acting, story line, special effects and directing of this release are far superior to the original. I thought it was a great flick but then I didn't try to compare or dissect the differences of the two. Who cares if this Quaid is not like the one 22 years ago. Let it go folks and take it for what it is."
4,Good movie,Pretty good remake. Had nothing to do with Mars though. Sexy co stars had awesome fight scenes. Will probably watch it again.
3,Holly-blah,"Gawd, they only get shot at like a million times... and not one of those bullets actually manage to hit them? This movie has a great story concept, killer special effects and decent actors yet it delivers poorly due to the cavalier hollywood approach of 'lets just throw a ton of money at the production and people will like it'.Too bad cause I was looking forward to seeing the story without having to watch Ahhnuld mash up the lines."
4,Nostalgia,"Really like this movie. There are a number of scenes that will bring back all those fond moments from the original. Great action scenes, decent story. If you're in the mood for an action movie, then you'll enjoy Total Recall."
2,More Hollywood blah ...,"This movie consists of a long series of shot-em-up scenes from start to finish. Pretty much the same bunch of good guys slugging it out with the same bad guys every scene. Not much of a plot. OK there is the mandatory pretty girl, not much else going on. The original was a clever movie for its time, and much better.Only reason to give it 2 stars is that the technical work on CGI was very good."
2,Disappointing,"Part Bourne, part Matrix, part Total Recall 1.Dull, predictable, and full of sweetener. Bad acting even for Colin Farrell. About 3/4 through the movie I got the feeling that all of this was filmed in a building the size of McDonalds. You can only take graphics so far. I'm not sure Jesus could have made it through that many close calls. And speaking of Jesus, why oh why, do writer's feel the need to break the fourth commandment every couple minutes? Is this what they call ""edgy and daring?"" You want edgy and daring? Try substituting the M word from another religion."
2,Total Recall,"not written very well; to much shooting; nice special effects;shallow, story not developed well, not as good as the original"
1,terrible,"terrible- convaluted....terrible...orginal way better. Dont waste your time, they dont even go to mars...What the ...some of the acting ok- director-BAD"
2,Not as good,Not as good as original but it did have lots of action. Why is there a minimum amount of words to these reviews?
2,I am too old!,I think if I never saw the 1st movie I wouldn't have judged this so low for ignorance is bliss. It was an ok movie if you have nothing else to view.
3,Better Than I thought,"I hate that Hollywood has no original ideas anymore and has to remake everything. I wasn't expecting much from this movie. But being a Kate Beckinsale fan I had to see it, and she is featured much more than Sharon Stone was in the original movie. In fact, she is the main villain.The movie is action packed. It is really one big chase scene. It did not disappoint as an action movie.However, also as an Arnold fan and a fan of the original movie I have to compare. This movie replaced the Mars plot with a kind of dying earth where only the UK and Australia are inhabitable and an elevator connects them through the planet core. Kind of dumb. In the original you are left wondering if it was real or part of the Recall fantasy. In this movie it is pretty much assumed he was a spy all along and the Recall experience just helped him remember. It lacked any kind of imagination or psychological twist."
3,Total Recall,Okay movie to watch on a rainy Sunday. Definitively not an Oscar winning production or worth watching a second time.
3,Good remake,This was a good movie but not great. We get to see the three tits again that made us take a second look in the original movie.
1,Why are all the great movies being torn apart?,"Classics beware. Your movie just might be remade in 10 years for the next generation. Just because you have CGI and huge explosions that take down a whole city block does not mean it is a great movie. They need to stop remaking these movies and start thinking again.I can say that this is a good time waster so rentable, but do not buy it. It is not worth the extra money."
1,Watch the original,"Characters show no emotion. It seems that this movie was just an excuse to create car chases, shootouts and explosions, with no real plot development. And the cinematography wasn't even so good. Lots of better choices."
1,Save your money,Had realistic expectations and still a let down. Save your money and try to catch the original version for free.
3,"All form, little substance, but entertaining","The new Total Recall was mostly all style no substance. There's so much potential in the story to be a heavier psychological thriller, but instead everything just ran fast for the sake of action sequences. Not one of Colin Farrell's best movies in my opinion. So many styles were copied in this movie. It was like Minority Report meets Blade Runner shot through the lens of J.J. Abram's Star Trek (blatant overuse of lens flares) and with an orchestral score that sounded lifted from Tron Legacy. I also didn't like how this future world just happened to have dubstep as the popular music for a nightclub. Waste of money? Not really, it certainly held up entertainment value, but I didn't feel connected with the characters."
2,No thanks.,Other than special effects this movie has very little going for it. I was not sympathetic to the characters at all.
2,Not worth watching,"I really like action movies and this one had promise. The special effects were fairly good. The half naked bare breasted woman with not two, but three bare nipples showing all, was stupid. Definitely not family friendly and it seems that some movie makers believe that the general public actually find that a few hundred swear words in a movie must make it more stimulating. Funny how some of the most successful movies of all time didn't have to use any foul language. I will not watch this move again. Ever."
2,boo,"really didn't like it. Not for me I guess, you may like it, I just felt that it was subpar in almost all categories... and I really didn't like the frontal nudity of the 3 breasted lady in the movie. weird."
3,New twist Its ok,New twist Its ok. Fun to watch good Sat night movie. Glad I didn't pay for going to the movies.
4,Not bad....,"Not at bad as I thought it would be, good action and pretty good acting for the most part and not very long."
3,so-so,liked the original better. it did have great visual effects but granted some effects werent available when Arnold did the first one
3,Story line pretty much same however I'd like the special effect,"overall the movie was o.k, I would recommended to a friend or family. stream movies was awesome through my PS3"
4,See it!,I enjoyed this movie lots of twists and great action. Never saw the original entirely but the Husband said this is better!
4,Total remake,Non-stop action full of plot twists and occasional humor. Much better than the one with Arnold on Mars. That one was cheezy. This one seems like it could be real some day.
4,Action Packed!,It made you think about what was really happening. Full of a lot of action and keeps you on the edge of your seat!
2,Mess with a good story line,No where close to the OG. I liked the story line of the OG movie much better. The effects in this movie was awesome.
4,Colin Farrell,"Master actor, Colin Farrell can make any kind of character real and layered no matter what kind of movie. This film is a realization of Philip K. Dick's original text. And just have fun with it."
4,Nice action flick with minimal gore,"The story line was nothing like the book, nonetheless intriguing. Overall it was a good watch. There are some fin action scenes."
2,I really wanted to like it.,"The streaming HD video quality on a Roku was great. Has some interesting visuals.I am pretty good at suspending belief enough to enjoy most sci-fi, but this was pretty unbearable."
1,Will Colin Farell ever make a decent movie?,"I don't know why I keep watching movies starring Colin Farell. Is he doomed with poor scripts and story lines, or is he really just a terrible actor? He redeemed himself as his role of a country star in Crazy Heart, so I thought I'd give him another chance. After Alexander, it's a wonder anyone would watch another Colin Farell movie. And one last thing about Total Recall, it would have been much better is Kate Beckensdale would have been wearing latex vampire slaying clothes!"
3,very entertaining,I like Colin Farrell as an actor he reminds me of Sean Connery at a younger age. I expect to see him behind the camera's if he hasn't already done so. All my friends who like sifi
3,Not a good redux,"Good special fx, but not much for a storyline.I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have time to kill."
4,:-),good Saturday night flick to watch on a Saturday night when it is Saturday you should watch it but not on Sunday because it is a Saturday night flick
3,meh MEH meh MEH! Eh Ugh well nah!,Yeah this is what I thought of the remake. There were in fact some clever ideas done in this movie like traveling from one side of the planet to another. I am so sick of seing Kate Beckinsale gale or whatever in these stupid rolls where she always wears a trenchcoat and basically plays the boring part of the half human half vampire in every action movie she has ever been in. Boo for this movie.
1,Very bad qualilty,"The cloud player doesnt play this video right, always goes from great HD to very low HD and have to wait forever to make it HD and takes forever to load."
1,Worse than I could imagine.,Total loss of the time. Another example of the good story replaced by special effects. The old movie was ten times better even without all that unnecessary computer graphics.
2,Didn't finish it,I can't truthfully write a good review because I didn't finish it. I lost my interest in the movie somewhere along the way and went to sleep. Maybe I was just sleepy......Maybe it was a good movie.......
3,S'alright,"Pretty good, can't put my finger on what would make it better. Maybe it was my mood. I would have liked more background on the state of affairs and there wasn't a clear reason for why what was happening was happening. Man, hard to do this without being spoilery. Cast looked great! Set looked incredible. Fun story."
2,"Eh, it was ok...","The original was better. I love these actors but was not thrilled with this movie. Not much plot, and the plot that was there was a bit confusing at times."
2,Not a very good remake,"This movie left out all the good parts that made the original so good. Good FX, but that is about all. The movie never even went to Mars."
3,A good remake,"This is a pretty typical action movie, nothing revolutionary here. But if you liked the original movie and you like sci-fi this will satisfy your craving. The only scene that really disappointed me was the remake of the scene were Houser is trying to get through a security checkpoint with a disguise and then the disguise fails; the original scene was so much more impactful."
3,Great effects; mediocre story,"Same old same old story with the good guy underdogs and the bad government. Lots of explosions, destruction, shooting, and nasty view of the future interspersed with a little dialogue. Not enough time and effort spent on the concept of reality versus memory and perception. Predictable..."
3,stream just ok,Good movie but couldn't watch in HD on my HD computer. But SD wasn't bad just would prefer 720p orver 420p.
3,Good Visuals,It was a good update of the effects but not so much of the storyline. It had a hard time keeping my attention.
4,Pleasant surprise,"Good actingEasy to follow ploteye candyNothing shocking as far as ""wow didn't see that coming"" just a good action flick that follows the success formula ""boobs, guns, explosions"""
5,out of sync???,"I'm a fan of the Len Wiseman and Kate Beckinsale team-ups. I'm a fan of both Jessica Biel and Colin Farrell. I liked the original and love what they did with this remake. ...but am I the only one who thinks the audio and video are out of sync? It looks like Kate Beckinsale is speaking English, being dubbed over in English... it's just not timed right. I seem to remember having the same thought when I saw it in the theatre way back when. Oh well, maybe there will be a remastered version."
3,"an ok remake, stil I like the original",the only problems is that I can't share with my family because the digital recording does not have Spanish audio nor subtitles so this fact is forcing me to bay the actual disk instead. this is very bad
3,Not a bad reboot,"Decent action, love the cityscapes, the nods to the original were good. Would have liked to had more dialog from the main character."
3,Total Recall? More of a Vague Resemblance,"As another reviewer mentioned, this film is just different enough from the original Ah-nuld movie and the PKD story to be enjoyable. It really bears only a superficial resemblance to its progenitors.Essentially one long chase scene, I thought the CGI was great, Colin F. did a far better job of being stressed and confused, while Kate B. had a delicious relentless menace. I'm still not sure what Jessica B. did.Pay no mind to the gaping plot-holes. (tunnel through the Earth's core? hardware store respirators and civie clothes in the No-Go zone contaminated by bio-weapons?) This is not a thinking person's film. Lower your expectations, open up the popcorn, kick back and enjoy."
5,Quality entertaining film,"I really like this remake of the classic total recall. They did a great job of depicting the future. Well shot, well edited, and the acting was on par."
3,ok movie,"ok movie, to much like original , needed more original action and suspense. Like trying to recall him with freind."
2,"Not bad, but the original is much better",Another disappointing remake. Not a bad film just no comparison to the original. Even Kate beckinsale couldn't save this film.
3,Come on Arnold was in the original,Great special effects but the effects didnt quite capture the original. I enjoyed the movie for what it was. Not sure I would recommend the movie. So that is why it gets 3 stars.
3,Good action and special effects but nothing special,"I liked this as an action movie, but I didn't think it was a very good movie. The acting was only ok. I prefer the Arnold version better."
1,amazon interruptus,I couldn't watch this movie since the amazon download kept quitting on us and then finally terminated completely. Must consider whether amazon is worth our time and money.
4,Good flick,"I enjoyed this, good action film. Enough intrigue and story to keep you guessing. Colin Farrell doesn't disappoint. Good co-stars."
2,Meh,I didn't really like this movie. I loved the original and I thought the special effects were good but overall it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen.
3,Not a re-make.,A completely different movie from the Swarchenegger original. Good performance by Colin Farrell. Bryan Cranston chews the scenery. Good SPFX.
3,Had us guessing,Good action film. Surprise ending offered suspense. Acting was average...no real character development. Entertaining for a couple of hours. OK.
2,OK,"if you have seen the other total recal you don;t need to watch this one, not sure why they copied the original"
2,Remake Schmemake,"I suppose it would be ok as your regular ""smashum - bashum - sci-fi summer movie,"" as long as you did not see the original. Even my 16 year old agreed ... He wanted to see Total Recall 2012, so we watched it (mainly while I played bubble-pop on my phone) because it was too annoying. Then we talked about the original and ended up watching it. He said he was glad he did not see it BEFORE the remake. That about says it all. I read that Schwarzenegger was highly aggravated that it was remade. After watching it, I have to agree. Watch the old one. It holds up very well."
1,Skip It,This movie was bad and the only reason it was filmed is the money to be from the name recognition.
1,Total Recall (2012),"The special effects were great, however, the story was a little disjointed. If you have ever seen the original movie it makes it even harder to watch."
3,So-So,"This was not one of Colin Farrell's best efforts. Not a lot going on, very predictable. Cinematography not very good."
2,1st one was better,"Much like most of hollywood, they remake movies. This is one such movie that did not need to be redone. It is a shame, because there were good performances and actors in it."
3,Actors did good portrait acting,Lots of action was let down by ending wanting to get a sense of what was next ended like on a loop whole comparing it with older
3,Still like the original,Good movie to see it once.I prefer the original though.Good effects. My wife didn't like it because of too much shooting and fighting.
2,Beautiful but lame,"movie is all over the place, looks great but is lame. don't pay for it, wait for it to be free on amazon prime"
3,Not bad,"Colin is adorable. Lots of action. We'd heard it was pretty bad, but it was not bad at all. Fun."
2,Not as good as the original,"It's hard to remake a good sci-fi film so I try to give remakes the benefit of the doubt. Some remakes are better than the original, but not this one. This film appeared to be created by removing everything that was interesting in the original and adding story content that defies common sense.Even if I had never seen the first film, this film was visually lacking, for starts. It might as well have been shot in black and white. The characters lacked depth and the premise of the story just left me confused. I did not understand the political situation that led to a train commute through the planet.I recommend you go back to the original film and skip this remake."
4,Great take in the Movie!,"Its well worth watching if you're a fan of Sci Fi. This is very different when compared to the original movie and should be. If anyone has read the short story ""We can remember it for you wholesale"" by Philip K. Dick you'll see why as this is the story both versions of the movies are based on. It keeps you thinking as you expect but some of the twists are different and original. The Plot is very different as it has more political impact as well as taking place at a different location then the Arnold version. Both are great movies but are very different from each other. This version does not disappoint at all and is worth watching, if not getting."
4,Action and plot twists with great special effects and set design.,"Nobody watches this kind of movie for the acting or the dialogue. That said, this is a high adrenaline rush. Great CGI cityscapes and technosets make for a visual spectacle. And so do Farrell and Beckinsdale. She's really becoming quite the action star gymnast. More power to her. And Farrell is well cast as the unwitting hero, he doesn't overdo it. Though the script calls for a few too many three-story falls where he just gets up, dusts off, and keeps running and rain-of-bullets-but -none-ever-hit-good-guys scenes it's still engaging and suspenseful. But if we're going to start taking stars off for plausibility, what movie would stand a chance."
3,I enjoyed it.,It's the same as Arnold's version but with a slight twist and better special effects. I wouldn't mind watching it again but I wouldn't pay to see it a second time.
2,bad... bad ... bad,"Colin Farrell looks better as a secret agent than his muscle bound counterpart but this movie lacks the comic charm of that one. I knwo the story is different but as a fan of the 1st, you wait to see if there are any similarities... over few. I will say that the tech used in this movie is awesome... that's about it... sorry kiddos"
2,Save your dollars,"Save your dollarsBought this remake thinking it would be even better than the first, with all the new technology, etc. If you like movies that are hard to see because the scenes are mostly dark, and have to read the synopsis to know they are entering the other side of the earth through a ""drill"", then this one is for you. Not my taste; Arnold has my vote on the first one."
3,Not bad,Colin is ok. But just not the same as Arnold. Some of the remakes just don't seem to be as good as the originals.
3,Niether good or bad,"If you have 2 hours to kill and can't decide on a movie, watch this.The plot is interesting.The 2 lead actress are rather enjoyable to look at."
3,an excellent re-do,"As re-doing the story goes, this wasn't too shabby. Kate played an wonderful villian and the acting and writing and direction was not bad. I had a few complaints but this is one of those ""you either like it or hate it"" kinda things."
4,good effects. just right amount.,good story re-told with more action. loved the twists and special effects. good actors. hard to follow in just one place.
4,What sci-fi should look like,"Fast paced, fun thrill ride with just enough callbacks to the original to kick some butt. Worth your time. Loved it!"
3,Good entertainment!,This movie would get higher credits from me if it wasn't a remake of such a good classic. This could have been an unrelated movie to the original total recall or a prequel or a sequel and I would have liked it better.
3,fair,Arnold's total recall was better than this one by far. Remade movies nearly never get to the same level as the original. Doesn't anyone in Holywood read new things. Make something original please.
2,Ehh...,"It was ok, good effects but story line and just over all wasn't as good as I thought. Little below average."
3,I wouldn't have paid for this movie,"The movIe is good in terms of action, graphics and special effects. Lot of things don't make sense, the plot is predictable and corny. Worth a watch but not worth spending your money on."
4,Total Recall,"A different twist from Arnies movie. Jessica Biel , Kate Beckinsale, Colin Farrell do a great job! Great special effects! Non stop action."
3,Kinda disappointed,I was kind of disappointed. When I saw that Total Recall was being re-made I was excited. I really enjoyed the original and I assumed with the impressive new graphics that it would be awesome. I'm pretty sure the only thing that was the same was the three boobed lady.
3,ok...not great,I like Colin Farrell...and would like to see him in more movies. Perhaps not this one. His movie star quality was lost in this garble of the original. Too many special effects and not enough character development.
4,Action!,Wasn't sure about this movie and I ended up liking it. I'm glad I have a big screen TV because it must be watched with the full movie effect
3,Its okay.,It had lots of action and special effects. I like Sci-fi movies but I think that the original with Arnold S was better.
4,Great Action,"I like to try to predict what is about to happen in a movie or how a movie will end. This movie was a challenge in that regard; which means it wasn't very predictable and in my opinion, that makes the movie a very good one. It had a good beginning and an even better ending!"
2,1st one was better,They tried to make this movie grittier than the original which they accomplished but much was lost in character development. The special effects were cool but the story 'retold' could have been better.
3,Not as good as the original,"Colin Farrell was great, but the movie just wasn't as good as the original. It was too dark. They changed the story line a bit, but it was still similiar. Maybe they should have changed it completely so that comparisons weren't drawn?"
4,Surprising Good,"First off I'd like to say that I like colin farrell, though if he's in a movie it tends to bomb. That said I was actually surprised how good Total Recall was. of course Im a fan of the original and hate that hollywood cant come up with a new instead just remakes old films lately. But it was good I might even watch it a second time, which most movies dont get from me. It stuck with original themes also having its own flare. Colin didnt destroy it, he might even made the film."
2,Great video bad sound,"I have received two copies of this BluRay from Amazon and both of them had a Doby True HD soundtrack that kept cutting out. I am using a Denon 1913 AVR with and Oppo BDP 93 BluRay player both with the latest firmware updates. The video is fine in this movie but, for whatever reason, Sony messed up the sound. I quite enjoyed the movie itself but this enjoyment was disrupted by the cutoffs of audio at rtandom times!Sony needs to fix this problem and for that reason, I am holding off purchasing this again until the issues are resolved. Why didn't they encode it in DTS HD Master Audio? Doesn't Sony own this audio encoding format?Beware!"
2,Needless remake,"Didn't add anything to the old version, had wooden acting, and just wasn't much fun. I fell asleep in the middle of some of the too lengthy action scenes."
4,Good Remake,I enjoyed the story with this one better than the original. It seemed that there was more non-stop action and that was fun as well.
3,Predicable but enjoyable,"Didn't get to watch the whole show but the story line pretty much followed the original Arnold production, effects in this version didn't look as polished"
3,Decent Movie,Takes itself a shade to seriously - all action - the prior version blended humor in to make it more of a repeatable watch.
2,Total Recall - Totally Different Story!,"I liked the idea of redoing this classic flick but found the lack of correlation to the previous story disturbing. They don't even go to Mars in this one which was the whole story along with the secret agent part from the last one. If you are going to remake a movie, add some things to the story, update special effects, but keep the basic story the same. Very disappointed..."
3,Total Recall,"Nice film to watch, different from original film. Movie buffs should really like it.Colin Farrell and Kate Beckensdale are terrific."
2,To much hype,"I had heard such great things about this movie that I pre-ordered it. I could barely stay awake through it! Maybe I was hoping for something more along the lines of the original Total Recall, but this was just slow and boring."
3,excellent spacial effects!!!,excellent spacial effects!!!... If the movie had a different name it would have been perfect!!!I did enjoy it. Thanks
4,good movie,I enjoyed this movie....great remake!! Action packed & good special effects! I would recommend this movie for people that enjoy action movies!
4,Much Better than Before,"Better rendition of the Philip Dick classic. This far surpassed the ""Ahnold"" fluff piece, getting more of the Dick ""post apocalyptic ruined earth"" flavor to it. Definitely worth the watch."
3,It was OK if not looking to use brain,Lots of action. Story was weak. Arnold movie was better (if you can believe that). Farrell has personality of block of wood.
2,Ehh... should have stuck to the original story,A lot of action but I was disappointed that they didn't stick to the original story. They missed the coolest parts of the original.
2,You just can't rewrite a classic.,"I won't say much because there is not much to say because, if you can't say something nice about something you should make it short and sweet, It really Stinks."
1,Waste of your time,"There's a lot of reviews here, so I will be short. You get interested at the beginning, the scenery is grand. Then, you start getting tired and bored. Around one hour and 45 minutes into movie you can't wait for it to end. My advice: rent the original created by great Paul Verhoeven with Arnold and Sharon Stone. That one you will really enjoy."
2,I couldn't finish it because Amazon turned the movie off,"I couldn't finish it because Amazon turned the movie off during play!I paid 5 bucks to watch this then I fell asleep, the next day I turn it back on and while I was finishing the last half hour Amazon decides to cut it off on me because it reached its 24 expiration!Amazon, how about letting an individual finish playing during its playtime? or extend the 24 hour by a couple hours to be perhaps generous to those who are trying to finish?"
2,Total Nonsense,"If it were not for the eye candy, I would have rated this terrible remake a solid one star. No redeeming qualities at all."
3,Mediocre,I like sci-fi thrillers a lot but this one was mediocre and very predictable at best. Kind of a waste of time.
2,Not worth seeing,This was a total copy cat of the original movie. They made added so much fighting to the movie that made it irritating to watch. The added parts made the plot all over the place and if you didn't see the original you would never know what was going on. They should have left this one alone.Totally enjoy the original movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger.only gave it two stars because of the video background.
3,Good But Not Original,Not a bad attempt at a remake of the original movie but could have developed the plot a little more and relied less on special effects. I enjoyed it but felt there is room for improvement possibly in Total Recall Three?
1,Total Recall = Total Waste of Time & Money,"SAVE your money, this movie is a bomb! It bears no resemblance to the original starring ""Ahnawd"". A thin plot with horrible acting and bad special effects. It's too bad I can't recall my money back into my wallet..."
4,Nice!,"I am not much on remakes, but I thought this was a good rendition of the originial. I would recommend seeing this movie."
3,Mediocre Reboot,Decent action movie but a little soulless compared to the original. Going to stick to the Arnie version in blu-ray.
3,It's OK,"This movie's got lots of action and good special effects. Some pretty good fight scenes too. But, I got kinda lost as far as the story line goes. I'm really not sure what the plot of film is. I was expecting this to basically be a remake of the original 80's movie but it's not. Maybe my expectations kept me from enjoying it more? It's just ""OK""."
3,Confusing Storyline,I guess this movie was not for me. I usually enjoy good sci-fi. This was not GOOD sci-fy. Plot was shallow and confusing.
3,okay,Collin ferrel was good and the ladies were great. Better than the old one but just kinda dry. When you are done watching it you are just like hey it was a movie. Just okay.
4,Colin Vs. Schwarzenegger,"I opt for the Terminator, without denying Farrel Colin any quality, however this remake totally over shadows the original version, and for obvious reasons. To begin with the cutting off the Martian scenario is a better reflection to the times we could be living in a possible next future. Today we are certain that Mars will not be colonized for another century or so, we are deeply exploring the possibility to produce a cybernetic entity, and the planet's population growing at incredible speed might give you an idea of the future, or should I say a possible future. I found quite interesting that huge elevator connecting two extremities of the planet, however it seems a bit far fetched that it could go trough Earth core harmlessly, but then again this is sci-fi, and with sci-fi anything goes. Acting is excellent. Special effects: fabulous. Maybe the fighting action is a bit exaggerated. I recommend to must see."
3,Interesting Twist... from the Original Total Recall,I think the best part of the movie is the special effects and futuristic technologies. It is definately helpful to watch the first Total Recall to appreciate some of the twists of scenes. I would have liked to see a better ending to the story line. Some of the serious emotional scenes had me wondering if the retakes were accidently left in.
1,Just Bad,To take a classic 80-90's movie and ruin it like this is a shame unless you want to watch a guy run for two hours...
1,download issues,Couldn't get it to download. I lost my internet connection before download was completed. When I got the connection back it still wouldn't finish downloading. Didn't get to see any of the movie so I can't tell you anything about it.
3,This movie was... okay,"It is hard to choose between 2 stars ""I don't like it."" and 3 stars ""it's okay."" 2 and a half stars is more appropriate.This movie has a decent but convoluted plot which was intriguing at some points but mostly I just wanted to get to the end.Average script (lame at a few would-be poignant points).Average acting by many supporting actors.There were creative futuristic set designs.The cinematography and special effects were well done."
4,Better than critics said,"The movie was entertaining and had some really good CG in it. Overall worth watching, with some references to the original."
2,My review,This movie was ok. I thought it could of been a lot better. It was overrated by the comercials. It wasn't what they made it seem.
2,Tiring,"Probably wouldn't recommend. I place the blame about 60% on director and 40% on the writers. The first 1/2 of the movie is a senseless sequence of chase scenes and you don't even have to watch them because the pounding drums will start and irritate you until you have a 30 second break before the next chase scene. Then the writers cut some of the layers in the identity crisis Quad/Houser is facing in such a way that it makes you believe they have no understanding of the PK Dick Story. And finally, the city Quad/Houser wanders through is simply taken from Blade Runner. They didn't even change the endless rain or the oriental voice making announcements for the city. Poorly remade movie trying to seduce you with action when then content was the story."
1,Terrible !,"Since movies nowadays are reduced to endless chases, gun and fist fights and explosions, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that this was more of the same. To call this reboot tedious would be an understatement. An utter and complete waste of time...well, there was Kate Beckinsale...so maybe not a Total Waste. Close though"
1,Wow. How Can Good Actors Make Such a Bad Movie?,I rarely review movies.I figure we should all see for ourselves.I just HAD to write about this one though.I love the actors but absolutely HATE this abomination.How can so many good actors make such a crap film?This is just sad. So sad. It just laid there like the proverbial milk dud in a punch bowl.Gag. YMMV. Member FDIC. Void where prohibited by law.
3,"Good, but it was more like a remake of Blade Runner then Total Recall","But, I'll watch it again to see if I missed something. Was good effects....Maybe a tunnel running through the middle of the earth was a bit tomuch, even for a sci-fi geek.."
3,Movies,"Even though I love the special effects in this movie, the original Total Recall storyline was much better. The two female characters in the movie rocked."
2,Good but certainly not as good as the original.,"Good action, ok story, not as good as the first. Worth renting on a cold and rainy day, don't bother buying it."
2,What's to like>,"Maybe I was looking for something closer to the original but it didn't even come close. The special effects were over the top, but very dramatic as were the action sequences. I just didn't like the feel of the whole thing, reminding me of the scenery in Blade Runner. Dialog was only fair."
2,uhg,"Why do we insist on destroying the movies that I loved as a kid. This movie has some great looking special effects - as does every movie made at this point. There is waaay too much Kate Beckinsale in this movie. She is a horrible actor, and this would have to be one of her worst roles. Colin Farrell was OK I guess, but still can't make up for this utterly ridiculous plot. At least the 3-boobed woman made an appearance."
1,Issues with Pixelization on Instant Video,"The movie was fine, but kept freezing every 20 min or so, the internet was reading at 30mb, so it wasn't our provider. I don't know what happened , but it was very frustrating to try and get through."
2,Poor Remake,"Other than the special effects available today, there was nothing new brought to this story. Also, some of the most crucial parts were taken out. If you just want to get your blazing guns and explosion fix this is okay. However, if you were a fan of the original, save yourself the disappointment."
3,Meh...,Very cool direction and special effects. The rest of the story was just okay. The first version was campy fun. This version takes itself a little too seriously.
3,"Visually Amazing, Weak Acting","Loved the look but the acting didnt' really grab me. I felt that this movie was made to mostly provide the requisite amount of gun fire and explosions. As odd as the original movie was with Arnold, I still got into that story more."
2,Don't Borther,"I love action/sci-fi movies and this was terrible. I fell asleep twice trying to watch it, could have been much better"
3,Not as good as the original,Total Recall was OK. Long drawn out fight scenes and sometimes a bit boring. We found ourselves wandering off while it was playing. The first Total Recall was more fun. This movie would be worth watching when it becomes free on Amazon Prime if you have a couple of hours and nothing else to do..
4,Original remake,"Good movie, much closer to the PK Dick novel than the original. Farrel and Beckinsale were great, Beil was a little vanilla but overall was a good movie. Closer to hard science fiction than the original, which had more comedy and fluff."
4,Same name different script,"I was curious how the reboot to the original would go. I expected something more in line with the cable series that played back in the 90's. the setting was entirely on Earth, not Mars, and dealt with pretty much the same story of a secret agent who loses his memory and ends up working for the good guys. If you can handle the idea of a tunnel that runs through the world from England to Austrailia it was an entertaining two hours."
4,Better then the original in my opinion,"I have always liked watching the original Total Recall. It was one of those B action movies that just calls to you to watch it. But I actual found this new version better, with a more contemporary story for the issues we have nowadays."
2,Sad,Strangely different plot. Thought it was a remake of the original. Missed a lot of detail and a storyline that would've made it more interesting but otherwise it's good for K-12 group
3,Watchable,"good action and a nice dystopian twist on the original. If you are looking for brain-doritos, a crispy snack with not a whole lot of intrinsic value, this is a good filler."
3,"Good, but, not as good as the original","Pretty much the same storyline as the original Total Recall. Obviously, special effects and graphics were better, but remakes are rarely an upgrade from the originals. My husband and I still like the Schwarzenegger version better."
3,Total Recall - version 2,"I got this movie knowing i would like the movie. But, the premise and the writing didn't hold up. There was almost too much special effects. Granted the writers threw a bone to the original by mentioning Mars. However, this movie didn't take place on Mars. The plot line went a completely different direction than the original. Other than the Recall machine awakened a secret agent. It was OK, but I'll take the original over this."
2,Should have left it alone!!,Colin Farrell is Okay!! and the little twists in the movie were good. Overall and as alaways the original was way better!!!
3,Ok movie,"Before I bought this movie I had already seen it on the big screen. Even though its not a fantastic movie, I like the remake with the similarities to the first and some of things they changed. In an action movie, I think Colin Farrell was great."
2,"Sadly, the original was better","Effects were great. Story weak. Sad that this one was even weaker than then original, which was not that great."
4,Good Action movie,"Aside from the fact that the British think they are the only ones who will be left on the earth. Where England and Australia are only inhabitable countries left in the world. Its a good movie, story follows the original to some degree though the story takes place on Earth and not Mars. Good Special Effects."
3,Not as good as the original,I watch this new one thinking I would get to see all the cool stuff from the original done in today's technology. But this new movie had a different plot that did not include anything from the original like that (except the 3 boob lady). Kinda disappointed.
2,Not Great,This version of Total Recall is great for special effects. Not good on story line. The original gave more history of what was going on and the new movie just dumps you into the middle of something (haven't figured out what yet). I wish this movie had used the old story line but with the new special effects.
3,Okay movie,This movie has a lot of action in it but at the end of the movie the viewer is left with a feeling of emptiness.
4,Terrific!,"I am SO NOT an Arnie fan, so this was right up my alley. Much better than the original as far as I am concerned. Thoroughly enjoyed this."
4,Great Movie!,I loved the action and story. This was a great remake of a classic movie. This is a must see for Total Recall fans.
4,Total Recvall 2012,Colin Farrell does a good job in this action film. I personally liked it better than the old version. Thank you
3,I wouldnt say I didnt like,But it wasnt as good as I hoped. It had some awesome action sequences based in a futuristic envornment. Tapered off a little soft but I would reccomend it.
2,Total Recall,I actually liked this movie. It was okay but not a 3 to me. WAY better than the original. Was better than the reviews I received.
2,Almost zero personality,"This is probably the biggest disappointment I've had with a huge budget sci-fi/action film. They do practically nothing to build the characters' personalities, and then the rest of the movie is them running and fighting. It's well shot, the acting isn't horrible, the faces/bodies are beautiful, and the special effects are spectacular. But because I didn't feel attached any of these characters, I was bored after the first ten minutes. It felt like a chore to finish it, but was hoping it would get better. I love sci-fi and action films as much as the next person, but please provide some decent character development!"
2,Takes itself overly serious,Pretty but bland. All most a shot for shot remake of the original film that has none of the charm.
2,Laaaaaaaaaaaaaame!,"Thoughtless, non creative, boring and very forgettable. Don't waste your time. I knew this movie would never live up to the classic TR but I expect some kind of creativity be it through action, humor, special effects, gratuitous sex scenes....give me something. I watched the entire movie hoping that there would be 1 scene to justify the $4 rental.There was not one decent scene, very disappointing."
2,Gave it two attempts to watch the whole thing.,I gave this movie two viewing attempts and couldn't sit the whole way through it. Someone asks me to describe this movie and I would say a whole lot of fight and chase scenes against a blizzard like backdrop of forgettable CGI scenery and eye candy amidst characters and a story I didn't care about for a second. Another glitzy remake with a screenplay written by a marketing matrix that would get a D from a community college freshman writing class. Other than one or two thought provoking dialogue snippets that didn't last long this movie is Eminently forgettable.
1,Not worth it,"I was excited to see a remake of the old Total Recall, which I fully enjoyed at the time. Of course, I started being worried when I saw that Collin Farrel was starring in it, as he has an habit of acting in massive flops...Unfortunately, my gut feel got proven right. While I believe that anybody who has not seen the 90's version might find this movie entertaining, it remains very flat.Do not get me wrong, I am not one of these nostalgic people who simply believe that ""it was better before"", and I am sure the old movie has aged poorly, but I have to say that in this case, I can only miss the humour, the 2nd degree of the previous movie...This one is just a simple entertainment: no emotion, difficult to get attached to any character... It even gets difficult to care whether you are in a dream or not !So, yes, very poor indeed..."
3,Diff than the original but cool,"The Bluray image is great, the movie isn't that bad. A different take then Arnold. Apparently everyone drives Chrysler in the future."
4,A Great Remake of a Classic,"Although the idea for the film isn't as original as when the Arnold version was released, its still a great film. The effects and scenery has changed, but still it plots a madman against the only man whom can bring him down. Great film."
4,Better than the first one,We enjoy the movie! The plot had a really interesting twist along with the special effects were superb. I highly recommend it.
1,"Sad waste of time, energy ... and special effects so convoluted, you may get a headache!","Much as I like Colin Farrell (and the film has a great cast, period), this is one godawful mess that barely even qualifies as a remake ... considering how much they changed and violated the original story. Action sequences, overdone CGI, and (at times) a screen so overloaded with visual effects you could almost get a headache, this version takes everything that brought emotional connection to the original and tosses it into the trash can - in favor of a plotline that somehow is both lame and ludicrous at the same time (seriously, Cohaagen's reason for doing what he's doing in this version could NOT be more of a yawn!). Really, really awful."
3,Good selection of actors...,"I liked the actors they chose for the movie and the computer animations and effects were excellent.The story... it's not something that should/could be reused in the 21st century/2012, if you ask me. Chemical warfare, revolution, dictatorship, and Asian or Cyrillic writing (not sure if it was Korea or what...) was a touch too 1980's for me. Don't get me wrong, the movie was fun to watch but about the level of Equilibrium. The world they created was just too antiquated for movies of this caliber. There was too much Cold War context for my taste in it. I watched it twice on separate days and it was a nice, casual movie to watch. It's the kind where you walk away, return, and don't feel that you missed much.I'd rent it somewhere for cheap or wait until it is available for streaming for free because it's not worth the money to buy it. Even if you appreciate Colin or Jessica's appealing physique, not worth the money to pay more than $10 for the bluray."
3,Not as good as the first one,The graphics were very good but the story was lacking. Why do movie companies remake old movies? cant they come up with new ideas for movies
3,Another Hollywood update,"This is another Hollywood ""Fresh"" remake that is well worth missing. I don't understand the need to keep the old name after so much has been reworked. The only consistency that I liked was the prostiture with three breasts. I wanted to see movie because I like(ed) Colin Farrell past work."
4,Enjoyable movie,Considered on it's own I found this to be a very enjoyable sci-fi romp. The filmmakers definitely made it their own film.
4,Entertaining Action Flick,"I like this version of the story better than the one from several years ago starring ""The Governator"". They did a good job of creating an interesting post-apocalyptic earth."
3,Visually stunning - but story all over the map,"Of course, I saw the first one with Arnold. So, it is hard ""not"" to compare this title to that one (I give them both 3 stars out of 5). Quite honestly, the movie was 'good enough' - not great but ok. If you like scifi, then you will be able to 'get through this'."
2,"Pointless Action, Very Little Story","If you're looking for even as much plot as the original, forget it -- the movie moves from one action scene to another without enough (almost any) time devoted to the plot. I'm an action junkie, so believe me when I say this is just pointless action. I liked a few fight/flight scenes, but that's about it.Wait to watch it on TV."
3,I fell asleep,"It seemed OK, but not riveting. I feel asleep about half way through the movie. I prefer the original one over this re-telling."
2,Blah!,This movie is so blah. I really couldn't get pass the fake wife who was like 90lbs was basically the toughest person in the whole movie.
1,Waste of time and money,This movie was such a waste of time. I actually started cleaning 20 minutes into it because I was so bored. My husband fell asleep both times we tried watching it!
2,Movie Version total Recall,"Not as good as the original , wooden performances and poor acting, same story, very much like blade runner, lacking imagination"
3,Total recall,Not too bad for a remake. Farrell did an awesome job trying to fill Arnold's shoes. Was action packed from beginning to end.
4,Total Recall Is A Reblast From The Past,"Every once in a while a movie comes along and grabs you by the seat of your pants and takes you for a wild ride thru the universe. Make no mistake,Total Recall falls into that category.This is a remake from the 1990s that starred Arnold, however it has been taken to a whole new level. You are submerged in a the wondrous world of sights and action that keep you engaged and guessing all the way thru. My suggestion is before you start watching this movie, go take a potty break because you won't want to miss one second of the action."
2,Over the top...,"...started out ok, but by the end I was worn out. Too much fighting/chasing/shooting/explosions, etc., etc., etc. The original version with Arnie was much better IMO."
1,Total Bore,"I fought sleep the entire movie. I thought it was just me, then I looked across at my partner and she was fast asleep. Total Bore is what they should've called it."
1,Stupid remake,"No character development like in first film, might as well be a video game. What about the poor folk on mars, we never even met them."
2,Why can't Hollywood start making their own stuff again?,"I'm not a fan of remakes and this is a prime example. The movie is very well made but they would have been better suited giving it a different name rather than trying to piggyback on the original. I imagine most will enjoy the movie, especially those who haven't seen the original Total Recall. Myself, it was a waste of a couple of hours and $4"
4,Expected Disappointment; got Entertained,"I enjoyed the original version with Ahhnold (no disrespect intended), and I'd read some reviews that like it better. I wasn't expecting much from the new version, but wound up enjoying it a lot. It ain't great film-making, and all the climbing and falling got a bit tiring, but I liked the basic story line, the acting was fine, and the f/x were excellent. I streamed it from Amazon Prime, and I'm adding it to my Blu-Ray wish list.Speaking of Amazon streaming, the quality was very good; no noticeable hiccups, picture and sound were fine. So glad I dumped the guys with the red logo..."
3,First was better,"In this updated version there wasn't as much emphasis on the Resistance group as in the original film. It really just felt like Houser was fighting one man, Cohagan. It didn't come across as Houser fighting for the Resistance against a man who had led to the opression of half a society of people. It came across as Houser trying to stop a current invasion from happening.Personally it was OK....clearly the special effects were awesome but some of the acting left a bit to be desired. The characters and their relationships were not explored at all.....there was much more to these folks int he first movie.I'll stick with Arnold...."
2,Completely different story from original,"This plot was completely changed from the original, leaving Mars out and putting the planet into a polluted state. Not quite sure why that was done. The plot was also as predictable as possible, all characters were cardboard cutout caricatures and there was no one you could really cheer. A lot of money wasted on a silly story - no wonder it left the theater so fast."
2,One long chase scene,I was disappointed with this movie. The special effects and such were good and it has some good actors and actresses but it just seemed like a very long chase to me. They could have done better I thought especially with the talent they had in the movie.
1,Use Total Recall to Enjoy,"This movie is one of the worst I've seen this past year. It is nearly 100% lifeless special effects to the point I could not believe anything I was seeing as real. The story, characters, scenes and acting were about as boring as can be. To enjoy Total Recall, use your total recall to remember the original."
1,OK If You Are 14 and Very Stupid,"Sick & Stupid Score: 6/9*More of the current national neurosis that is gripping the Ritalin Generation: Your memories are not your own; you have no idea who you are; an evil force is controlling your life. And way more of the feminist fantasy that girls can be as tough as boys. More escape-and-capture sequences than a 1930's cowboy and Indian Saturday matinee movie. More ""Blade Runner""-style racial diversity than ""Blade Runner."" More computer-generated graphics than....When will these awful movies ever end?____________________________* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid. A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie."
2,I really wanted to like it.,"The effects were great, but the acting was not compelling. I also wished that they had kept the mars angle."
2,Fell asleep,"The movie was so boring. I prefer the original by far. I love sci fi movies and its pretty rare I'll fall asleep during a movie, but this one did not keep me entertained. It even had two amazing actresses, that still wasn't enough to keep me from snoring over half way through."
4,Surprisingly Entertaining: Minority Report meets Bourne Identity rather than total rehash,"I enjoyed this movie much more than I initially expected. It deviates from the Arnold version sufficiently to provide a visual feast and engaging story but does pay homage to the original. The presentation's picture quality is excellent accompanied by a stellar audio presentation in Dolby True HD. Dialog was clear, gunshots (and there a lot of them) quite discrete and whizzed by my ears in surround glory.As much as I enjoyed the Arnold version I prefer this version due to the more contemporary story and of course stellar visual effects. Arnold's version does win on the classic one liners though; Colin Farrel delivers several but they're lost in the intensity of the action scenes. Overall definitely worth at least a rental and highly recommended but awarded 4 stars as it's a remake.Of note, audio playback was flawless on my setup. Several viewers of this Blu Ray have reported issues with the audio."
2,Totally Forget about it.,The acting and dialogue was awful. The special effects were straining to support the porous plot.I would not watch this film again unless I had one of the those systems that erases my memory so that I could survive viewing the agonizing poor acting.
3,Better than the last version,"Good action and reasonable effects for a Sci Fi flick. Seemed like the ""I Robot"" movie was an influence in this version.There are better movies out there and a lot worse. But for light entertainment this was not bad."
3,Previews led me to expect more,"I have not read the book, but am told that this version is closer to the book that the Schwarzenegger version, which I loved. This had great potential, with the excellent effects and technology, but somehow it fell short. I think it was because its elements were either not as good as the original or not developed enough to engage the viewer. It was almost as if parts of the story were skimmed over, cut or condensed. It was good enough for a rental, but I'm glad I didn't buy it."
4,Like the actors,Very futuristic. I dont like it when everyone is shooting at you and you get missed and they get hit. Make a smarter get away plot.
4,It's great!,"Great movie! It stick pretty close to the first ones, but has some great special effects added. Everyone did a great job in it! I'll probably watch this one again!"
3,So much action....,"If you want action, this bleeds it. No plot or silly story to get in the way, just a guy having a really bad day and everyone wants to beat him up. Using the bathroom? Beat up. Cooking? Omelet smack down. Sleep? Pillow fight!For those who crave action like a teen with ADD charged hormones this is your movie. For anyone expecting something other than superman face punches..... No."
4,Own Story,It was different than the first but it had its own storyline. I really enjoyed it. Would recommend it to someone else.
3,Original was much better,"While this remake was action-packed, I found that it just wasn't as good as the original. Good visual effects though."
3,Never gets off the ground,"The original movie had to rely more on human actors and less on computer generated images. It's hard to feel anything for an army of robots, even if one is painted black while all the other ones are white (storm troopers/Vader). The movie has a ""Blade Runner"" feel to it and that doesn't help at all. Quaid is never actually hooked up to the ""Rekall"" computer, which is strange. Why would you use the name ""Rekall"" in the movie and yet call the movie ""Total Recall""? The constant action can keep a person entertained, but it felt like an empty experience to me."
3,NOT as good as the original,"Though the special effects are undeniably better than in the original movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger(the Impregenator), the characters are not as likable and the storyline not as engaging. It's a mediocre movie, at best."
2,Visually Stunning Garbage. Don't bother.,"The storyline is trash and takes excruciating hours to develop. Seems like every 5 minutes 2 people are outnumbered by enemies, find a crazy way to fight out of it, we get lulled into terrible, dragging dialogue, then 30 minutes later rinse and repeat. Lots of CGI, many scenes will leave you salivating over the stunning effects, but takes more than that to make a movie. Don't bother."
5,Good Movie,I really enjoyed this movie !!! I never really listen to the critics and I am glad I didn't on this one.
5,Great movie,This was a great movie! I like any kind of movies that takes place in the future! I like how there was also a love story to the movie also!
2,Poorly recorder audio,"Great movie, but very poorly recorded audio on the blu-ray disc. Seems to be a common problem with this movie release. Search the web."
3,Good Special effects sub-par acting,Enjoyed the twists that were different from the original and the Special Effects were excellent. The acting was so so but so was the acting in the original.
2,Really didn't need to remake this movie.,If you're going to remake a movie you should make it better than the original. Think I'm over 15 minute long action scenes.
3,Not as much fun as the first,"This remake was okay, but not as well written and as much of a joy ride as the original, but I do think Colin is a pretty good actor"
3,entertaining..,"Reviews are better than the actual movie. That being said, it was entertaining and we would recommend it.Efeects were solid and acting was OK."
3,Total What !!!,"Why this movie takes a different route from the original is beyond me.Hey Arnold, Give these guys a little help and get this version of Total Recall, As much help as it can possibly get."
2,The original didn't need a remake,"I couldn't get into the movie, maybe because it strayed far enough from the original that I had a hard time following. My opinion may have been different had I not been a fan of or seen the original but I doubt it."
3,Kids Loved it.,My kids loved it. But I still rather watch the Arnold one.Why does hollywood try to redo movies all the time.
3,Meh,"If you have nothing better to do it's an ok way to kill roughly about 2 hours, it's not bad but pretty meh."
2,Disappointing.,"This movie had so much potential, great effects, great actors, but yet it still it left me standing. The original was better... even with horrible special effects."
3,Visual Stunner Fall Flat,"Having been a huge fan of the original movie, I couldn't imagine that today's movie technology and stars like Farrell, Beckinsdale, and Biel could not outdo the previous version. Well, I was wrong. The stunning effects couldn't save a flat story, one without the nuances of the previous version. A cast of uninteresting characters and a modified back story had this one fall on it's face. Very disappointing."
2,Remake Storyline Lacks Compared To Original,Fight sequences are top notch along with special effects. The story line is quite weak and lacks direction. The original is worthy of purchase. The remake is worthy of rental.
2,Totally Struggling,This was a very poor attempt at a remake. I think they thought that special effects would be so much better than actually having a story line. It was flat with no real story which just made it boring to watch. Definitely not one of my favorites this month. Don't waste your money is my recommendation.
2,just shooting,Not worth any expense it would be better to just watch someone play a violent video game for two hours. The plot didn't even involve Mars. So sad.
4,Total Recall - remake,"as it turns out I really did enjoy this movie.Being a Schwarzenagger fan I really wasn't expecting too much from this ""remake"", buy I was pleasently suprised.The film really is not a 'Remake' of the original film in the traditional sense.It is based on a slightly different story line.Very well done - excellent casting - I enjoyed it.Excellent Action / Syfi"
4,nicely done,"I personally liked the more campy Arnold version, so wasn't sure whether to see this or not. I enjoyed it's being a bit more gritty and how some of the shared parts/characters of both movies were portrayed.If you haven't seen the first one this would stand up fine on it own though it did miss the ambiguity of the first ending"
2,I was bored,Just not worth the money to pay to watch it. Slow development and flat characters. The original was so much better.
3,Its ok.,Its probably really fun to watch for those that havent watched the orginal. The original was kind of fun and hokie.. err best word i could use. This one be a 4 star if i handnt know the story from the original. Its likely be fun for others who havent. This one I think is better than original mostly cause of better animation but i give marks on the original of putting more confusion to the story hehe. Some still fight over the ending on the original.
2,Garbage,"After seeing the original with ""Arnold"" I found this poorly done remake to be boring and not even worth watching. I turned it off after the first half hour."
2,"A remake, weaker than the original.","Well, of course decades later, the special effects are much better, and if they had gone to the original source and done a new treatment, that would be one thing - but they followed the first movie's story line very closely, only with pointless changes that weakened both the suspense and the logic. I guess they wanted to make the female characters stronger, and maximize screen time for the high-dollar female actors. And really? Colin Farrel as a super spy? Overall fail."
5,Totall Recall - almost the same,I enjoyed the movie and thought it was very entertaining. The concept is the same as the first version but everything else is different
3,Less Than Original,"The action kept this movie going but it seemed like this version had even less plot than the previous Total Recall. I think it may be confusing to people who had not seen the original. They updated the technology and in some ways tried to make the story more believable (like the fact that no one can go to Mars). Since it's still set in the future the future Earth is still depressing like the original. It's good for the action, I'd watch it again."
3,Poor story line.,"I found that the movie was over done with the special effects, but yet very little story line that made hard to draw you into it.I falling a sleep on it 3 time. Then just gave up looking at it."
4,ok movie,"this is a good solid action movie. the action is all good. the actors are 1st rate. i've always loved Colin, and this movie is worthy of him. and for me the plot is really well thought out. Different than the 1st movie with Arnold, different plot and better future world, and they also kept a few points from the original movie and incorporated them, well, into this one, but didn't over do it. i like that. great director. 4 stars."
4,movie was good,"movie was good.the quality of the streamimg could of been better,think net flex does better with that.The picture was jumpy.but will probally use this movie rental again.nice to not go to the store."
4,good entertaining movie with non-stop action,"The movie was quite good, great acting and graphics. Unfortunately my family kept interrupting the movie all the way through, will have to see again soon!"
4,Total Recall 2,". The Story line was similar to the Original with Aronald Schwarzenegger, both are in the future. The both are about a person that wanted to try a new way to relax where they can live out there wildest fantasy."
3,Slow ..preview made the movie more appealing than it actually was.,Slow .. Preview made the movie more appealing than it actually was. Was more like a wannabe move.. Some action...
2,Ehh...,"This movie did have some nice visuals, but overall, not good. Compared to the original... this is a piece of poop. I was extremely dissapointed with this remake, check out the old one it is awesome."
2,Meh....,"I expected a lot more because the original was pretty cool. If you have seen the original, then you might have the same feeling about. I wouldn't say that it was worth renting it, but if it were free, oh well, don't complain if it is free, right?"
4,Great movie!!,"Very entertaining; action packed with an interesting story. Colin, Kate and Jessica all were suited for their parts and provided interesting drama among their individual characters. I would recommend this movie for die-hard action fans."
1,Special effects,"good special effects technology, but that's all. Very little story. Ok for the younger set, but not for us thank you."
3,Not as bad as I heard,"Not a great movie, but it was a better than average dumb action movie. The whole memory thing is interesting, but really, this movie is all about the action. I really liked the look of the world they created as well. I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys action/sci-fi and isn't really picky about a movie being ""great cinema"""
4,Better Than The First One!,I thought this movie was better than the first Total Recall.Kate Beckinsale was amazing and she outdid everyone else in the fight scenes!Would watch again!
3,Great action somewhat disappointing ending,"This version is a fresh take on the older movie with Arnold. I liked the non-stop action. The characters weren't comical or cartoonish. There were some clever nods to the old movie (the lady at the checkpoint). Overall the movie was entreating, however the ending was way too simplistic which made me forget it almost immediately. I guess I may need a partial if not total recall in a couple of hours :).If you like lots of action and hot looking actors without too much of a plot line than you will probably enjoy this movie. As fake and silly as the old version looks today I think I still like it better though."
5,Great remake!,"If you loved Schwarzenegger's role in the original version as I did, you will also love Farrell's performance in the new 2012 film. At the end of the original version I had unanswered questions, but those questions were put to rest by the 2012 release. I'm a fan of this type movie so it was high on my list as soon as I heard about it. I have read some not so good reviews but I guess these guys just don't get it. I highly recommend this movie for all science fiction buffs."
4,Good sci - fi movie,It contains a lot of high technology and some great action scenes + great looking women. Kate Beckinsale - I really like her.
3,Similar to the Schwarzenegger version,"Other than the 'S' word every 20 seconds this was an entertaining movie. If you've seen the Arnold Schwarzenegger version you'll pretty much be a step ahead of the story. If you haven't seen it you'll probably find this somewhat entertaining. Good special effects, good acting, decent story ... it's worth a rental."
3,Expected more...,"Full of action, but lacks substance, plus always wanted to compare to the original one.It's hard to produce ""remakes"", but still..."
2,NG,"I chose this because the original movie was so good. Good science fiction requires some element of plausibility. The original had it, this one does not."
4,Better Than the First,"Similar script, but this one didn't get stupid in the last third like the original did. Great special effects. And you can't beat Jessica Beal. Even if the film didn't show her guns, abs or any other major skin, she still rocks."
2,Bad Remake,Confusing storyline. Very hard to follow. Remake is not as good as the original. Lost interest after 30 minutes but forced myself to watch.
2,I Recall the one with Arnie being much better..,I Recall the one with Arnie being much better. Don't waste your time. Nothing new to see here. Watch the old one again.
4,great movie,"it was a great movie, action packed and thought provoking at the same time, i know this was a remake, but it was different, which made it stand out"
3,"Not great, but entertaining",A good movie to watch on a big screen TV with the surround sound turned up! Not worth the cost of seeing it in the theater.
1,worst movie,"I recall watching the version with Arnold, this version was boring and put me to sleep. would not watch again."
4,I liked it!!,It was a good movie that kept me watching it. Colin Farrell did a great job!! I also liked the two women that were in it
4,better than the first,"this was a great movie. i would have watched in theaters, probably better than my HDTV, and been happy to pay for the tickets!"
5,Total Recall,The movie is not a remake. It has familiar names some familiar connections. Other than that it was action packed with special effects with a man on the run trying to do the right thing.
4,"Not bad, Great special effects Story line in the original was better IMO.","Great special effects Story line in the original was better IMO. But it is a relatively good movie. As long as you arent expecting more than great effects, shallow story and a lot of action."
4,I Liked It,"The special effects were over the top, making any movie worth watching in my opinion. My only dislike was the alien touch that the original had, was removed and rewritten. Other than that, Great Action, Great Kate!"
2,Disappointing,Didn't come close to the first movie. The plot was silly. I wasted my money renting it. I'm glad I didn't go to the big screen to see it.
4,Different take on an original,With a few changes here and there the reshooting of past movies sometimes leaves much to be desired... but the visual effects are updated with some great effects.
1,One long high speed chase - one big crashing dud,"No atmosphere (Like watching a cardboard cutout of the original, a very well painted and decorated cardboard cutout, but lifeless), no music that strikes a sense of wonder, no likeable personality present in the main actors. Even though the pace was fast and the action non stop, I found myself wanting to fast forward this movie to potential scenes I was familiar with when I watched and enjoyed the first Total Recall back in 1990. I found very few of those scenes. I've watched the original Total Recall many times over. Bought the VHS and then the DVD... I really wanted to like this new version as much, I don't think I'll be watching it ever again."
1,The new total recall sucks,"just a terrible movie colin farrelle is a terrible actor. how could you remake gold you cant alchemist have tried the original was way better because it had Arnold and his dry sense of humor, make you laugh and then make you die. ""you think this is the real Quaid? well it is"". may god have mercy on holy wood for destroying classics. i was fortunate enough not to have paid to see this garbage but unfortunately i had to sit through this awful film FML! if you liked the original buy the new one if you want t be disappointed."
1,Junk,This movie is pure junk! If I had not seen the Original I would have no idea what it was about.
3,it tries really hard but never quite gets there.,"I love sci fi so for me this is an own it kind of movie, but even then it was still just ok, everyones acting is a bit off but passable. Rent it if you like it buy it, otherwise you will have lost 3.99 at the most?"
3,Yet another Futuristic Dystopian Adventure,"Nothing new under the sun, really, but a diverting two hours or so. Genetic relations with its genre fellows on display throughout. Acting fine. Sets a bit predictable."
4,Great flick save one small thing....,"Seriously... Obama's face on currency? I hardly ever speak out in a movie theater.. but that sight caused me to blurt out ""Bullsh*t"" quite loudly."
1,"abandon all hope, yea who don't like chix hulkin out corny crap",Shoulda renamed this cougar kicks ass or something and yep its laughable.Colin farrel is funny since he hasnt figured out that hes guna be outa hollywood in few years if he doesnt start learning howto act hes already getn older.sighthen we have old ass bekinsdale who was never hot to begin with hulkin out and i mean posing and huling lolthis is unaceptable for an action moviethe execs should be beaten with soap bars in a sock for thisunles shes had cbernitic muscles you cant ick ass with 1 inc arms ok?also kick the execs who puts adrian brody in alen v predator 7 for thsi kinda s***cmon holly wood get friggin betterdont even get me started on how awesome the arnold version is compared
4,"I liked it, not the same as Arnold's movie, but good too.","I am not a book reader, and I heard that there is a book that this movie was based on, and this film follows the book better than the other movie with Arnold from a few years back. That said, they both were entertaining. I enjoyed them both, and this one I found that although there were some very different concepts of the movie (everything stays happening on Earth on this movie), I liked this just fine. With new technology and special effects, the movie was really neat, but I wouldn't get too cranked comparing it against the earlier one with the Governor."
5,Great action flick!,"Loved this movie, really loved the first one, so this was a no brainer. Although they changed it up a bit... still worked and with the added bonus of Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale...a definite must see."
4,Good Action Movie,Good CGI and lots of action with solid acting by a good cast. I will say that there is less on the story than the original due to all the action. Overall still a good movie.
3,QUALITY PROBLEMS?,"The movie is good. The sound is very good. The quality of the recording...............?I'd give it one more star if the quality was good.I returned the first one I received because it had loss of sound and/or freezing too often at around the middle of the extended version. The new one also had the same symptoms at about the same point in the movie but they were easier to clear. The only other disc I had trouble with on this machine was the BluRay Tarja Act One which I later learned gave trouble to almost everyone. Is anyone else having trouble with this Total Recall BD?UH-OH!! I just read my own review of Prometheus Blu-Ray. It had problems too. My 400 disc BD Sony carousel machine only has a few months of use since I bought it refurbished at a Sony outlet. I just ""Ethernet-ed"" it to it's latest update. It plays all other discs flawlessly. Anyone notice a decline in quality of the recording media, or should I suspect my machine?"
3,mixed feelings,"well, from a guy that loves action, sci/fi, thrillers, etc. this is one of the types that i would NOT own on dvd or blu-ray. To me its the kind of movie that just isnt worth watching more than once. definitely worth buying for $2 or $3 at local pawn shop or garage sale."
3,Not as fun as the first one,"There were no surprises in the 2012 version, more of the same only better special effects. I give it a 3 out of 5 stars. Better to rent instead of buy"
4,ILoved it!,I realy injoyed it! More than the Mars version of Total Recall! Colin Farrell & cast showed me a storey that seened real!
2,Don't waste your money on this movie,"Don't waste your money on this movie, the original is so much better. The story seems pretty made up and contrived, and is missing all the charm of the original Mars setting. The only thing that keeps the movie from getting 1 star is Kate Beckinsale."
2,Total Recall,"Not nearly as interesting as the original Total Recall movie,way too many chase scenes and a vague almost incomprehensible plot. No ""CC"" access on version I viewed."
3,Good for those who aren't big sci-fi fans,"I thought this version was much better than the original. Stunning visual effects, well-choreographed action sequences, and cool sci-fi concepts made the movie a lot of fun. The plotline got a little convoluted at a few points, but overall it was fun movie for a weekday night!"
4,Good Movie But Not Like the Original,"The movie was good, still not as good as the original but the updated graphics and explosive action made up for the lack of originality in this remake. I Was a little disappointed that some of the Iconic scenes from the original never made it into this remake however ironically that is probably the reason I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The movie could be considered a remake but it also seems to come off as its own film. This ""Total Recall"" is almost and entirely different movie then the Original ""Total Recall"" and I think that makes it worth watching as a stand alone movie."
2,predictable,"The ""hero"" is shot at about 10,000 times and is only hit once. The plot is very predictable, but is dumb in a lot of places. The only different thing about this movie is the villain female is better looking then the heroin. Bad guys/gals are usually ugly because we are less likely to identify with them then we are with the pretty people. See if you like a lot at shooting and beating up and reasonable special effects."
5,Welcome Back Colin!!!,"I am so happy Colin got clean and I am proud of him!!! He did an amazing job with this movie! An old movie with a new twist, sorry Arnold I love this one more!"
2,Minimum Recall,I had to think very hard to remember what this movie was about. It was totally forgettable for me as it relies to much on CG and action scenes and contains too little in the way of story and character development. This has become the Hollywood formula these days since they have pegged their audience as dull headed action freaks. Fight scenes were way too long. I had to apologize to my wife for picking this movie when it was over.
3,It's not the original.,"If you are a huge fan of the original like I am, don't expect the same thing. As far as quality of product, 5 stars."
2,Nothing more than a remake,"Appears as though kate beckinsdale needed work, as this movie was nothing more than a showcase for her as ""not a vampire"". Lets face it the original wasn't really that good and this latest rendition follows in the same vein as all other remakes. Nothing wrong with the movie, just nothing right either."
3,it was good...,"It was good, but I liked the story line from the original better. acting was good too. I think it was worth the rental"
1,Do Not Waste your time,This movie had so many plot holes and the story was going absolutely no where.... not worth even a rental
1,Blah,"A very poor imitation of the original. I mean sure, the special effects are, of course, better but the acting? Not even close. Ad to that the poor story line. It has been rewritten in such a way that it is difficult to keep up with and, frankly, unrealistic. England builds a subway tunnel, through the earth, to Australia just to exploit Australian workers whom the English then decide to wipe out with an ""invasion"" through the subway tunnel???? I liked Mars better."
1,Hollywood don't forget to wipe.,I usually don't like giving low scores but frankly the Sci-Fi network could have produced a better movie than this for less than 1% of the budget. Colin Farrell showed up to the set I assume but he must have left his acting ability in is Escalade Hybrid. Jessica Beil umm she's pretty. Kate Beckinsale plays herself in the film. Woodbine's Harry was the only interesting character in the film and he got shot in the head. Mabey this film should have been shot in the dark with no sound.
5,Great Remake,Was hesitant at first but when got cabin fever and went to see it on the big screen I knew I had to have it for my blu ray collection at home. I think it is better than the original more up to date and expecially the computer graphics are better.
3,Totally Recalling the original...,"I enjoyed this film, but found myself longing for the original. Too many changes to the story....The special effects, action, CGI, & acting is phenomenal.....but the story just didn't hook me the way the original's did."
4,Farrell as Harrison Ford in Blade Runner,"Farrell completely makes this movie. It's easy to compare him to Harrison Ford in Blade Runner. It's Farrell's angst and uncertainty - not his bravado that makes this movie. It's not (Arnold) Swarzenegger at all. And it's smart, I think, for the producers to realize that it could never have compared to him. As another Blade Runner, though, it works because the actor has as much uncertainty as the audience. Farrell discovers what has happened to him and it adds to the movie. Everything else - all of the sci fi and special effects add to the movie. Granted it may not be a weird classic like Blade Runner, but it definitely it worth seeing for a thrill. Credit the director for getting the actors to believe in the story line."
4,Not as good as the origonal,"This movie as that was promised, more action than the Origonal, and it was really cool to see Kate Beckinsale play a bad guy (or girl I should say) and the CGI was really cool, but if you think about it the Origonal was really rather quite inovative for the 90's that movie did thing's that no one had even thought of at that time. I really wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be, the acting really wasn't all that great, well that's not fair the acting from these actor's is always awesome but the screen play just wasn't what I thought it would be. While it wasn't regergated of the 90's verson it really could have been better, although it is on Amazon Instant Prime it can be watched anywhere which as my family travels is quite nice so all in all yea I give it 4 stars."
2,Not good,"WARNING SPOILERS This is one part Blade Runner, one part original Total Recall, one part Judge Dredd the original, and one part Total Recall the Tv series. They should have kept the plot the same as the original. First mistake is they made the Earth and the cities like Judge Dredd, Blade Runner, and Total Recall the Series. Earth had been mostly decimated by chemical warfare. Second mistake is they changed the plot to happen all on Earth. The technology and effects were great but they screwed it up by changing the plot."
4,"Tastes good, and no soy!","My son is allergic to soy (""modified vegetable protein"") which makes most canned and dried soups impossible for him to eat. This one is a staple in our house, though, because it is soy and nut free. Let's hope they do not change the recipe!"
2,Chicken Noodle Soup,This is not what I was wanting. I am looking for old original Chicken Noodle soup. It had thin vermicelli noodles and chives chopped up in it. This needs a lot added to it to make taste like it should.
4,Good and easy,"Great product. Sometimes it is difficult to find at the local grocery store. Since the individual packets have such a long shelf life, getting the bulk package every so often works well."
3,Ok,The book took a while to get here and is pretty marked up on the inside but none the less I got it in time.
3,Text book principles of real analysis,"The book itself is good, but the binding sucks! After the first week the binding is coming apart, now the book has all these loose pages."
4,Met needs,Not a lot of color choice in high heat enamels from all suppliers. This came closest to matching the appliance beige of the older wall furnace I was repainting. One surprise is that the final finish was closer to flat than gloss. Not a real problem but it will collect dirt faster than a gloss finish would. The other is that the same paint was $2/can cheaper at local Home Depot last time I was there.
5,Outstanding!,My husband does alot of smoking in our smoker. The original finish came off and rusted. We purchased another product and that burned off in one use. We purchased this product and it is holding up well. We are pleased with the purchase.
5,Moving,"This is an amazing real life story. It is moving to the point where you cannot believe the mental capacity of some of the human race. I will be directing the stage version of The Laramie Project this summer so, I wanted a little more of a visual stand point. If you like powerful, moving stories; this ones for you."
5,A powerful and uplifting movie,"This is an excellent film! I really urge everyone to put this film at the top of their list of must-sees. I thought the acting and the direction were absolutely incredible and the movie has really stayed with me. It is a very unique kind of film because it uses actual interviews from real people as its script. I was skeptical when I first heard about it as I really didn't want to see a violent, graphic movie depicting or re-enacting a hate crime, but so many different people were telling me I HAD to see it that I decided to risk it. Whether you remember or don't remember the details of the killing of gay university student Matthew Shepard it doesn't matter. The movie is not really about the crime itself but with how the people of Laramie, WY dealt with it. In the end the movie is totally inspiring and uplifting, with humor and thought-provoking scenes throughout. It is really about where America is today. I put it in my all-time top ten!"
2,thoroughly depressing ...,"This film, which is really just a series of re-enacted interviews, is a dismal portrayal of a community in agony. It's natural when someone you know dies to feel sad, miserable, angry and outraged. But the producers of this film dwell on the community's misery and suffering, and any opportunity to learn from this crime is lost in the raw emotions of the town's residents.This is, quite simply, a film with an agenda. It is intended to incite anger and promote hate crime legislation. Dwelling on this crime is not going to do anyone any good."
3,The Laramie Progect,"I bought this movie for a church discussion project. Haven't used it yet, but believe it will do the job quite well. Thanks."
4,A Must See,"I found this movie to be an excellent perspective on the Matthew Shepherd murder. I used it in a group discussion of the issues surrounding this event. The participants in the discussion were all teenagers, and they responded energetically to the issues raised by the film.Unlike some of the other reviewers, we did not find the use of actors to portray the citizens of Laramie detracted from the film at all. In fact, we were in agreement that the portrayals were very good and conveyed the emotions of the residents far better than the residents themselves may have been able to in front of a camera.I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in the Matthew Shepherd murder, as well as to all who are involved in discussions around the issues of human sexuality and sexual orientation."
4,the laramie project,this movie is a great tool to show you the details of the murder and court procedings on the matthew shepard case. it is done in true documentry style and is put together very well.
5,An awsome film that really keeps to the play,"This incredibly moving film, really keeps to the play. Definitely worth a watch just to see some spectacular acting by a great selection of actors and actresses. There wasn't a dry eye in the room!"
2,disappointing,"the whimsical music in the background really detracted from this movie, especially considering the subject matter. that combined with the editing gave it the feeling of a long commercial. it's too bad, because the material was facinating. if the movie was made up of authentic footage, it would have been an incredible documentary."
3,As an Actor; good but not great,"As an actor that was actualy in the play version, i feel that this movie did as good of a job that you could expect a movie to do. In the play 8 people play all the parts and so the characors are much more dynamic, all the charictors are very flat in the movie. I did not agree with some of the casting, the person the played Jedidiah Schultz was way fidgety and odd for the part, ... . Also they cut half of the Techtonic theater project members. I feel that a video tape of the stage play would be much more effective than this movie but it still has a certain place in my heart."
2,Just a made-up documentary,"This movie is simply a documentary. In fact, it's really just a bunch of interviews. And interviews with actors portraying the original people that lived in this town. So, really, it's just a made-up documentary.That understood, it was well done. It looked real, the actors did a great job. I don't remember hearing about this true-life incident, so I wasn't swept up in the emotion, nor was I really interested in the event.I would have liked this movie a whole lot more if it was NOT a documentary, but a re-enactment of the whole incident, from the Shepard boy's life and home and at school, to the murder, to the aftermath. THEN, the interviews could have had some meaning.I watched it. I sat through the whole thing. But if I came across this documentary, or rather, a REAL documentary with the real people on Discovery, A&E;, or some channel like that, I would change the channel and not be interested at all."
5,Great,"As a Wyoming girl, and a friend of Matthew Galloway, I felt a personal closeness to this story. The movie was touching and I could feel the Wyoming community shine."
