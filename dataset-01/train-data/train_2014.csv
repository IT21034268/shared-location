2,Disappointing Addition to Stone Barrington Series,"The earlier Stone Barrington novels were farfetched, but riveting, with an attractive hero and tongue-in-cheek humor. But, in ""Worst Fears Realized,"" Stuart Woods continues a decline that began with the execrable ""Orchid Beach."" This book is better than ""Beach,"" but not by much. It does have Stone Barrington, which is something. But where is the humor? Where is the mystery? Woods is writing by numbers these days, and it's unfortunate, because the man can write well. When he tries."
3,Fact or Fantasy,"I really enjoyed Woods latest book. However, sometimes it seems his setting is a little ""other worldly"" to a reader from the rural mid-West. Can you really enter a New York car dealership and purchase an armoured car? Nevertheless, I found this a good quick read and will continue to seek out Stuart Woods books when browsing the library or book store"
3,Typical Stone Barrington,"I enjoyed the plot of this book and the ending leaves you to believe that there is more to come where Barrington and the Mob are concerned. My biggest complaint is that regardless of his feelings for Arrington, he has to fall into bed with every female that he spends more than 1/2 an hour with. This was a very quick read and I am looking forward to the next Stone Barrington adventure."
4,Light but Tasty,"This books falls into my own ""Light but Tasty"" category (from a Richie Rich cartoon I read years ago). I enjoy Mr. Woods' books. They are always enjoyable to read and don't require much heavy lifting."
3,CAN HE MAKE WOMAN MORE BORING,"I like the book for only one reason; it's a ""fast"" read.It's the kind of book I would give to somebody who was going on a plane or trip on a train.Mr. Woods does not give you any material that is going to work the brain or your imagination. His characters do not come alive;they are flat. He gives them no personality; especially the woman.Could he make that Italian woman;Dolce; more sallow?.I think this is the kind of book if you got half way thur and put it down you can start reading it again 3 months later, there not much you can really forget.Since I travel often I would most likey get another Woods book. It's fast- easy reading and is much better than the airline's magazine."
4,"Excellent - - Just Drop the ""Culture""","As usual, Stuart Woods has crafted an excellent yarn revolving around his ""alter ego,"" Stone Barrington. The read moves crisply and takes several interesting turns along the way to a satisfying conclusion. Woods is a gifted writer with many first-class novels to his credit.The one gripe I have with Woods' Stone Barrington books is his frequent dwelling on ritzy wines, foods, cars, clothing, etc. It's as if he is trying to impress his reader with his class and culture. Stuart: A little of this goes a long way.I hope Mr. Woods' next endeavor is away from Stone Barrington - - something a little more challenging, like his five-star ""Chiefs."""
2,it is not that bad but ...,"It is not that bad, it even has a couple of fine and unexpected twists in the plot. It would deserve three stars, but there are way too many nauseating sex scenes."
3,Fast Read But Not Up to His Usual Standards,"Have read several of Stuart Woods' novels and have always enjoyed his style, the twists and turns he employs in his plots, and most especially, he way of phrasing. Found this particular plot line interesting but the writing was not up to par--I know it may seem picky but I found that he re-used certain phrases repeatedly, which I found not only annoying but gave the book a mechanical feeling. But even a lesser writing style can be overlooked if the plot is such that you can't put the book down. Unfortunately, this book starts off like gangbusters and simply peters out. The conclusion feels hurried and a bit too pat. If you are looking for quintessential Woods, go back to Palindrome, Chiefs or White Cargo - by far a superior read."
3,Great! Barrington Is Back!,"Yes that's right, Stone Barrington is back to face a truly dangerous criminal, Herbert Mitteldorfer, strange name huh? Well anyway, Herbie was put away by Stone and his cop friend Dino Bachetti. Well Herbie is BACK and ready to blow away Barrington. Watch out STONE!"
2,It's ok; but he needs to find a good editor.,"At times, it's almost insulting (wasn't Arrington's baby a girl in the last book?), yet somehow, I read on .. Thankfully, he's advanced from his book-end descriptions of how progressive his typesetting is to how he now answers e-mail, as opposed to snail mail. And while I comment Mr. Woods for entering the 90s, it's blatantly apparent that he still needs to find a competent editor."
2,Not worth the effort,"I agree with many other reviewers. This book is a step below some of Wood's other works. The story is fairly weak, and the ending comes far too easy for Stone. It was as if Woods had a much more elaborate plot, but cut it short and ended the story without finishing. I couldn't believe it when I was 50 pages from the end of the book that Woods could wrap everything up and solve the crime in the next 50 pages."
5,Best book yet by Stuart Woods,Stuart Woods never fails to please. He has a winning combination with Stone Barrington and Dino Bacchetti. I have recently completed reading the Worst Fears Realized book and am already looking forward to the next one. This was a very quick read but never dull. T.S. Stewart
1,Is there another Sturat Woods?,I find it hard to believe that this is the same person who gave us so many fine books in the past. I sure hope this is just a fluke.
2,Not Up to Snuff,"After reading Stuart Woods' latest it's hard to envision that this is the same man who gave us ""L.A. Times"", ""Run Before the Wind"", and ""Chiefs"".It seems to me that ever since Woods decided that Stone Barrington would be the main protagonist his storytelling skills have eroded. The ending to ""Worst Fears Realized"" is a major letdown and almost insulting to the readers intelligence.Nevertheless this latest book is entertaining in a shallow sort of way. Worthy of only two stars."
1,Worst Fears Realized by Stuart Woods,"Woods first books were riveting. Perhaps, at times far-fetched, but good character development, etc. This thing is not worth the time it takes one to read the cover. There is little plot and that is true of only the first few pages. Stone's ""bedding"" becomes central with little relevance to plot. Very poor. I agree with another reviewer - I didn't care if they were all murdered. I wouldn't have cared if I had lost the book! It is the only book that I have literally thrown in the garbage."
4,Worst Fears Calmed,"I bought this book as part of a buy one; get one and this was the ""get one."" I read this one first thinking it would not be as good as the one I originally ordered. Boy! was I wrong. I really liked this book! And so much that I went out and bought Dirt (which I finished in two days) and Dead in the Water (which I am starting today). Worst Fears and Dirt were both fast reads, but not ""fluff"". I just could not put either of them down. I will try other non-Stone Barrington books next."
1,Zero Stars -- Do not buy this book!,"Well, Stuart Woods has already proven he can write. Too bad he doesn't try to write in this book. It has all the hallmarks of being tossed off in fulfillment of a multi-book contract. One wonders, nevertheless, how any self-respecting editor could have passed on it.The book is a piece of garbage. It's not worth even a dollar. I read it because I paid for it, but as I've done with many paperbacks I should've just quit reading and tossed it after 30 pages.For anyone who has admired Stuart Woods past productions this project will be a profound disappointment.I should have paid more attention to the Kirkus review, which is on the mark.Do not, repeat not, buy this book!!!"
5,"Witty, Factual, and Straight to the Point",I meet the author at lecture and dinner program. He is a great speaker and his book is enlightening. My husband attends York University where the author Michael Mandel is a professor at the Osgode School of Law. I hope to attend more of his lectures and read more of his book(s).
1,Poorly researched and with an anti-American bias,"This book is poorly researched, and the author has a very clear anti-American bias. When the author lacks evidence, he simply speculates by saying things like ""it seems"" and notes how his conclusion is ""evident"". Rather than always citing to evidence, he favors political commentary and other biased sources. When I was pleasently suprised to find an unbiased reference, more often than not the author provided a slanted interpretation of it (often through omission). Lastly, the author blatantly misrepresents the legal aspects of international law in favor of how the author would like international law to be. As an attorney who works in international law, I found this to be the book's greatest flaw. In sum, this book is little more than an anti-American rant presented in a academic format. I do not recommend purchasing this book."
1,A hack does a hack job,"The book is filled with nothing but trash. How can a law professor not remember that the UN charter DOES allow self-defensive acts? How many times do you have to be struck by an enemy before you strike back, regardless of whether you have UN permiso or not? Fine, so the attack on Afghanistan was in retribution and violation of Geneva Conventions, but what was America to do? TALK the terrorists to death, rather than with bombs? If the professor really believes in law and justice, then why doesn't he beleive Saddam's and Milosevic's actions were grounds enough for going into Iraq and Kosovo? Also, if he could judge the actions of the Allies in WWI and WWII, would he hold THEM to the same standards and level of criticism?"
5,Great Lamp,Lamp is very sturdy and well made. A great addition to your office or den. A must for any Hokie Fan!
2,stale and most are broken,I'd rather buy these cones from the grocery store for a little more money. Most of the cones are broken and stale. There are no expiration dates. It just says deeded on a sticker.
5,SOooooo DELICIOUS,"These cones are the best cones I have ever had. They are similar to the sugar cones in the grocery store but without the chemicals and have less sugar. My huaband and I use them as a treat in the evening with soy ice cream of various flavors. I like the fact that the cones have less sugar than cones in the grocery store and that they are organic. Our doctors have told both my husband and I to eat ""organic.""No they are not gluten free but not everything can be gluten free. And yes I had a few in each box that were broken We just broke them up and put them over the top of a dish of ice cream.There is no more broken cones in the boxes than the ones I used to purchase in the store. Frankly everything I purchase in my grocery store is usually broken such as chips, tostitos, etc.Try them - you will love them."
1,"mis-categorized, beware!","Those of you on a true GF diet need to be aware that amazon's sorting algorithms have some glitches... this is one of them... if you are GF, DO NOT buy this product! First ingredient is wheat flour :-("
1,NOT GLUTEN FREE,"These cones show up on a search for gluten free groceries but they are obviously NOT gluten free (wheat flour is the first ingredient). Amazon will not change the category of items like this but ALWAYS read the ingredient label carefully, and if you are in doubt, do NOT buy the item!!"
4,Well written and very informative,"Holger H. Herwig is perhaps the best English writing author of the Imperial Germany in the First World War. This, like all the other Herwig's book, is easy to read, never dull but still very accurate. The only flaw of this book is that it gives David Lloyd George the merit of being the father of the convoy system. That old story story invented by Lloyd George in his memories was exposed in 1989 by John Terraine in his Business in Great waters. On can't blame Herwig of that. This book would be of greater value with correct foot or end notes. I guess that some 95% of the readers don't mind of that so this is not very serious criticism of this great book."
4,Lovely...,"I got this for several tracks I REALLY wanted, but the collection really has some over good music. Glad I got."
5,Can't Wait for Her Next Book,"I loved this book on 2 levels: First, having an autistic nephew, I found much in the story that was eerily similar to our own experiences, sometimes with much different reactions and outcomes, though. Nice to see it through another's eyes. Second, Ann Bauer is a gifted story teller. The story captivates the reader with both it's portrayals of the circumstances and the emotional journey of the mother (and father to some extent.) This is not only a story of an autistic child, but is a story of motherhood and a marriage. Don't miss this book. (Beware, some of the reviews below give away far too much of the storyline. I suggest reading only part way if you'd rather wait for the book to give you all the story. Why do reviewers do this?? How inconsiderate.)"
4,An Atypical Child and his family,"Though a lot of reviewers have called Edward, the central character in WILD RIDE, autistic he is better described as an atypical child with some autistic characteristics. Bauer does a great job describing the impact a child who is very different from others has on his whole family and particularly his parents. WILD RIDE is especially interesting because Edward's mother (Rachel, the narrator of the book) includes researching family history in an attempt to help Edward. The story of her maternal uncle Micky's difficult life in the mid 50's is a compelling story in itself. Rachel also looks in to her adopted husband, Jack's, birth family. Jack, himself, displays some unusual characteristics as he has an uncanny ability to heal, problems with employment and authority and just an unconventional outlook on life. While this is a generally well written book there are spots where time shifts are handled in a confusing manner but a bit of rereading makes all clear."
4,Engaging,"Ann Bauer takes her readers into the heart of a marriage and allows them to experience the frustrations and challenges of dealing with a child who is ""different."" The fact that Eddie can't seem to be classified adds to the frustration and also to the hope the parents continue to have for their son. I am now an Ann Bauer fan because she made me feel what it was like to be Eddie's mother and Jack's wife. Ann Bauer did in this novel what other writers hope to do, and it was done with empathy and grace."
3,I wanted to love it...,"but I only liked it. Dealing with children with special needs in my profession and being a mother I thought I would find a lot to relate to in this book. I wanted the mother to demand someone to give her answers about her son, and she just never got to that point. By the middle it was dragging. I won't be seeking out more of the author's book."
5,Excellent book on dealing with autism,"This book is brilliant in that it deals with everything a parent goes through in dealing with a child with autism - dealing with denial, trying odds way to remedy the situation, coping with their own depression and panic, going to doctors and more doctors, hurting other people in the processandfinally giving in to acceptance.It was a wonderful book and the writing exceptional. I got a small glimpse into the world of autism and how people on all sides react to it.I recommend it highly."
4,"Good, durable, Lego toy!",This toy is fun for almost anybody. Its electronic lights and sounds make it great. It also divides into three sections for reentry. So pick up a copy from amazon and go home and build it.
2,Capitalizing on the surging Vampire market,"While waiting forDead and Gone (Sookie Stackhouse, Book 9)to ship to me, I grabbed this off the bookstore shelf in desperation and because Charlaine Harris had written a little blurb assuring her readers that they would like Anna Strong.I don't really like her. She's a tough chick-turned-vamp not ready to give up her human life. I like tough chicks, but after awhile Anna Strong just gets boring. Loose threads are left dangling by the author over several books in the obviously planned series - not because she is stringing us along but simply because she forget to pick them up again."
4,not bad start,"I agree with the review who said everything in this book seemed larger than life. I agree that the emotional content was lacking. I even agree that even though the back of the book stated she would have to choose between two men, one of them, her boyfriend, was missing from much of the book. Yet, I still enjoyed reading it. I think Stein has something going here and if she can work through getting her characters more rounded and actually showing more depth and emotion, I think she could have a great series on her hands. The sex scenes bit. That would be something else to work on."
1,Boring,"Uggh, could barely finish.So many better vampire characters and better thought out powers/limitations in other current series. Mind reading but no sunlight problems? Really?Some mysterious benefactor that comments in her mind and gives advice but is never explained?Bad romance sections - from book ""I feel like I'm living a scene from a bad romance novel."" Yep read that way to me too.Ending fight was disappointing. Sometimes vamps move with super speed but then just seem to wait to be staked.First and only time I've used Audible refund option."
4,I actually read the book,I was looking for a new series to start and this one looked good. I made a good choice. Strong story and character
3,Decent First Book leaves room for growth,"First all those comparing this to Laurel Hamilton there is no comparison in plot, characters, or skill. This book was a good read not the best but not the worst it got my attention which is saying something and makes me want to see if the promise is fulfilled in book 2. As with a lot of series you have to establish the story line and this book does it well. It is on the same skill level of Mary Janice Davidson, as it is compared to her on the cover- while she is an author I read and is highly entertaining I do not rank her one of the best- just a solid author not a great one which is what you get with this book as well."
5,Excellent,"I really loved this book from start to finish. It was hard to put down and keeps you guessing all the way through. Anna is a great central character - loyal, intelligent and resourceful, and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series."
3,Left me wondering.,"As a native San Diegan I was really hoping I'd like this book set in my home town, but I didn't. I'm not sure what it was.Anna felt wooden to me, she had emotions, sure, but for a first person narrative I felt completely disconnected from them. I kept trying to chalk it up to her being in shock, but as the novel wore on I just got more and more bored with her story. She didn't even seem all that interested in it.I did enjoy the twist on the mythos of vampires, and the structure of the society they live in. All in all, I'd say the book was interesting and well built, just the character development needed some work.That being said, I did buy the second book, and we'll see if I like it better than I have the first."
3,3 1/2 stars much better than average but not quite outstanding,Anna and her partner Dave are skip tracers (AKA bail enforcement) and encounter a vampire. Anna is changed but gets her powers gradually not all at once; a very interesting approach. She is mentored byAvery a centuries old vampire with a rather alien outlook. Refreshingly the author doesn't spend a lot of time on Vampire culture or community. Overall the plot is quite good although a little predictable. The characters are well drawn as well.Overall much better than average and only a little below outstanding.
3,Fairly good,"Anna Strong is a bounty hunter with her partner, David. While on a case she is bitten and raped by a vampire. Then begins the process of her adjusting to being a vampire, and frankly, this didn't take much time. I liked her character and I enjoyed the book, but there were a few things missing. Such as, Max her boyfriend, who is an undercover cop for the DEA played a next to nothing role in this book. Her love interest turns out to be...Okay, I can't say, that gives it away. I liked this book enough to read the next one, Blood Drive. All in all, not a bad effort."
1,predictable vampire junk,"Bad, bad, bad...no real character development, boring plot, predictable chain of events, and not even any believable relationships. Don't waste your time."
3,"If you get past the first few chapters, it gets pretty good","""...All in all, I know most of what I have said seems negative, but once the book got past the rape and the smut, it really started to pick up and I didn't want to put it down - I was very interested to know what was going to happen next, who was behind certain things, when she was going to realize who she could or couldn't trust - and I'm definitely going to pick up the next in the series! If the rest of them continue the way The Becoming left off, they should be full of action, which is what I expected from a series about a bounty hunter-turned-vampire.""For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"
5,Good Beginning,Read this book in two sittings. Believable principal character. Good story. Will look forward to the sequel.
1,"Boring, predictable","I do not review often, but I thought I could help out those looking for a new vampire book. I love LK Hamilton, Butcher, Harrison, C. Harris, K. Chance, etc. (check out my goodreads profile, /hexgirl311 if you care to see) and Amazon recommended this book. It was quite boring and super predictable, this from someone who is surprised when watching the Friday the 13th movies that everyone dies at the end. The plot has too many coincidences, the characters are fairly stupid, and there isn't much vampire lore to immerse yourself in. Skip it."
3,"Disappointing- a cross between Anita Blake and MaryJanice Davidson's Undead series, this is not!","I was pretty disappointed by this novel- it struck me as boring and predictable, and not in any good ways. I found some of the character's actions really surprising and didn't seem logical or fit with the character at all- until I realized that Stein needed them to something in order to move the plot.The romance was entirely absurd, the sex scenes contrived nearly to the point of being unreadable, the plot didn't make sense, even after the denouement. I was left with all sorts of unanswered questions (unanswered because Stein doesn't bother wrapping up her plot or tying things together or making her characters' decisions make sense with the ""world"" she's built) and wasn't intrigued, I was annoyed.Meh. I don't think I'll even get the second novel at the library and this book is definitely going in my Goodwill pile . . ."
3,"Not quite what I hoped, but gets better as it goes on","If you read the blurbs on the cover, Charlaine Harris (who I really like) thinks her readers will enjoy the book. It's also described as a cross between MaryJanice Davidson (who I kind of like) and Laurel Hamilton (who used to be good). Definitely sounded promising. The book gets off to a slow start as they try to set up some big-ish changes to the vampire mythology. There's little or no humor, and the heroine seems amazingly dense for a supposed investigator. Eventually things settle down to some serious butt-kicking and a few more interesting characters are introduced - enough so the book is a tentative ""keeper"" and I'm willing to give the sequel a shot. We'll see..."
3,So Bland ...,"A friend bought me this book a week before Christmas. She was spot on because she knows what I like to read. I appreciated the fact that it wasn't a textbook romance novel ... No sex scenes ... I was grateful for that. However, I felt the dialogue was just terrible. Anna, the lead character, was actually pretty lame and gullible. The story was alright, I finished the book, but it took me a week to do so ... Im so used to having a book that I can't put down that this disappointed me a little. So yes, the story was alright, the dialogue was terrible and the outcome was predictable. I would recommend it to someone who doesn't read as much as I do, or doesn't expect much from vampire books. I give it 3 stars because 1) I finished it, 2) 'Casper' intrigues me, and 3) I want to find out how she stumbles about being a vampire on her own without the help of the vanquished Avery. I'm hoping the next book is better than the first."
3,Good beach read,"It wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't bad. The supporting characters were underdeveloped, but the plot was good. Very face paced, kept me interested, but was too short."
2,Not Very Good,"I really don't like the main character, Ana Strong. Ana just strikes me as an idiot. There are the main characters that are impulsive but over all intelligent and realize their mistakes quickly. Ana Strong is not this way. She does things that just don't make sense and she isn't smart enough to figure out she has made the wrong choice 'til much later. I realize she has to come to terms with becoming a vampire but how many times do people have to ask you ""how long have you been a vampire?"" because of something you did or didn't know before you take at least some of the supernatural creatures that have been offering to tutor you up on their offers. I fail to see how she has managed to have a successful career as a bounty hunter without ending up dead.I have read the 2nd book in the series hoping that the series gets better and it really hasn't even though some of the secondary characters have become more interesting."
5,AWESOME new heroine!,"AMAZING!This is easily the best new book I've read in a very long time.Anna Strong is a female bounty hunter turned vamp.She's gotta solve a few mysteries and catch bad guys while she adjusts to her new condition.She's powerful, but vulnerable. Kick-butt, but flawed.Very refreshing and welcome addition to the genre of butt-kicking chicks in the fantasy/paranormal genre.I LOVE that she doesn't go into detail describing every outfit she wears, swoon over every male she meets, whine about her misfortunes or obsess about herself. (Like so many heroines in these types of books do, which I find annoying.)There's enough action and suspense to keep the reader hooked.I couldn't put it down!I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Kim Harrison, Kelley Armstrong and EARLY Anita Blake series by LKH."
3,a new twist,"This book is a slightly different take on the vampire stories I hold so dear. Anna Stong's character is likable and interesting. She conveys a strength that is necessary to make you want to know what will happen next. Overall, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who loves the vampire genre as much as I do."
5,Good toy good price,Bought for a friends child for B-day (turning 7) of all the toys he got for his b-day he like this one the best...he and another boy ran off playing with it...and i heard them a little while later as they rushed by me say I love this toy. Just what I was going for..and at under 6$ what a steal. I should have gotten a few more to have on hand.
3,looks great,My 4 year old son openned this on Christmas morning and loved it. It's durable and very eye-catching. He had trouble pulling the string to get it to fly. In that regard it would be more for an older child. He still plays with it on occasion. There is no educational value to it other than for facilitating pretend play.
2,"Poor Acting, Plot with gaping holes",I bought this DVD based on the 5 star reviews that it received here. I must say that this film was close to a complete disappointment. Tommy Lee Jones can usually be counted on to deliver his schtick in a fairly convincing way. Not this time. I offer the evidence of his performance in the regergitation scene where I have seen more convincing acting in my children's school plays. The other actors don't even merit a mention. To be fair I think the script and the directing did little to enhance the performances. perhaps the actors did the best with what they were given. On to the plot. The writers did not even seem to try to patch up the many holes in this completely illogical and contrived story. For a made for TV movie it is fine. Just don't expect much beyond what that genre typically delivers. Cheers!
2,"I USUALLY GO FOR THIS TYPE OF FILM, BUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE?","Concidering that I really love a good noir, or neo-noir perhaps going in I was expecting too much. Although having a stylish look and feel, and the music fit the mood, I like both Tommy Lee Jones and Virginia Madsen in several other films they done, however this film just didn't do it for me. The acting was streatched to disbelief probably overcompensating for the Swiss Cheese of a plot. This was by far NO Chinatown or L.A. Confidential. Two stars is more than generous."
5,Gotham,"Gotham is not the original title of this movie. I feel the original title caputured the essence of the movie and it was a mistake to change the title. There is a lot to like about this movie and I only wish it had recieved the credit it deserved when it was first released. Gotham is a tightly woeven story full of suspense and intrigue that keeps the viewer guessing till the end. The actors have done a supurb job, I especially like the character played by Tommy Lee Jones. It is one of the rare opportunities that you get to see him playing the romantic leading man. I especially enjoyed watching his character unravel as he becomes captavated by the 'ghost' he is meant to be investigating. I only wish that the ending was as good as the rest of the movie, as I feel it lets the movie down slightly."
4,quirky imaginative great music,"Under rated when it came out. Hard to find now. Amazing performance of ""Danny Boy"" by J.B. White. worth seeing just to hear him sing so sweet"
4,A great head unit!,"I'm running this head unit to a 1000W Profile 4ch amp, to 2 sets of Polk db 6500 with a Kenwood KSC-SW1 powered sub to round out the spectrum. I also have the XM black box and digital adapter.The Pros: The USB and SD card options are a real breakthrough in music options. The deck can operate a 512Mb SD card, and a 4GB flash drive. This means no more CD's rolling around in my truck. The sound quality is amazing! The motorized face works smoothly, and seems fairly sturdy.The Cons: This head unit has a pretty large learning curve. Because of the single knob/enter button, scrolling and selecting options can be kind of a pain. Initial setup is also a painstaking task. It has sound settings for every seat and speaker in the car, but trust me, the sound quality is worth the 1.5 hour setup. Also, the display is a little on the grainy side.Overall I would highly recommend this unit. Once you've taken the time to learn the menus, it's a great unit for the money."
4,"""Holy Crap!""","Three weeks ago, I had never heard of Atticus Fault. It was cross referenced on Amazon to another album that I purchased and when I listened to the samples on-line, I was intrigued enough to purchase the CD.I received it a few days later, popped it in the player and put on my headphones. I was immediately drawn in by the stunning musicianship and soaring melodies. After three tracks, I literally said out loud, ""Holy crap! These guys are good!""Repeating listenings similarly left me shaking my head. I was/am mesmerized by this music. Some tracks are reminiscent of Pink Floyd (especially track 1) but the overall sound here is uniquely Atticus Fault. Highly recommended."
5,"""Thick and lush""","Atticus Fault is one of those jewels that never really saw too much light of day, thanks to a collapsed record label. Their style of music really shows through, with the eccentric and alternative tastes of the likes of Coldplay and Radiohead while mixing in their own fullness of sound that really takes your auditory experience to a new level.If you're interested in alternative styles, buy this.If you like a full bodied soundtrack, buy this.Or if you're just plain curious, buy this.At around $3, how can you go wrong?By the way, this band is back in production and working on new material. Hope the best for them!"
5,GREAT FUN!,"I heard this CD playing in a local music store and immediatelybought it. Susanna and Matthew have come up with a fun, light,musically valid and entertaining album. It's an extremelywell-chosen batch of hits and obscurities from the mid-to-late60's (and one from 1971). All the harmonies and attention tomelody that you've come to expect from each of them is presenthere. They stick pretty close to the arrangements of the originals andyet it comes out sounding very ""them"". Notevery song is a ten out of ten: ""Warmth Of The Sun"" and ""MondayMonday"" really didn't need to be done again (although there isnothing wrong with their versions). But the love that they bothshare for this era of music is evident in their performances, aswell as in the liner notes. Is it an earth-shattering successthat will shake you to your very core? No. Is it one of thebest collections of covers I've heard in a very long time? Yes!Listen to the sound clips and judge for yourself."
4,Sweet music,"It is quite apparant through UNDER THE COVERS that both Matthew Sweet (Sid) and Susanna Hoffs (Susie) are very fond of 60's music. Obviously because they did this covers album, but the melodies are fun and very similar in arrangement to the originals. They have selected a number of songs from the 60's, some well known, others obscure. Sid and Susie (as they call themselves on this CD) compliment each other quite well! I have to say my favorites are their take on The Stony Poneys ""Different Drum"" (where Hoffs sounds an awful lot like Linda Ronstadt), Velvet Underground's ""Sunday Morning"", and many more. All of the songs are really enjoyable! Here is hoping and looking forward to Volume 2!"
2,Two things about this album,"First, it reminds you that both artists are darn good vocalists and should do something with their voices with consequence before they get too old (no, this isn't it). Everything here is very competent in terms of production and sound.Second, it should be a stern reminder for anyone else thinking of doing something like this to totally forget it. Remaking ""Cinnamon Girl""? ""Monday Monday?"" Are you insane? And then trying to nearly copy them note for note (and pretty much succeeding), what's the point of that? Lots of people try things like this, even the Simple Minds of all bands, and no one has ever pulled it off. Music to play when you feel the need to throw up. Just embarrasing."
4,"Great Taste, No Revelations","""Under the Covers"" is a solid album covering '60s and '70s pop tunes. Sweet and Hoffs have the talent and production chops to put together convincing remakes of some well known songsand some exciting obscurities. Mostly it works well, although Sweet should never again attempt early-period Beach Boys (he just can't sing up there effectively). The album is more a celebration of Sweet and Hoff's great taste (and Sweet's guitar prowess) than an album with anything urgent or fresh to say. It's a pleasant listen and a good way of getting lots of great tunes in one place. But it doesn't really do anything all that innovative or moving."
2,Not up to par-excellence of Matthew Sweet,"First, none of these covers are done better than the originals.Second, for those of us that love Matthew Sweet, Susanna Hoffs voice tends to be annoying.Third, Don't waste your money. Wait for some original Sweet music."
2,SUPER Light,"I usually don't bother to write reviews of music I don't like. Well, I will an exception here after buying the cd that got me sent this one( FreeBird,a rehash of Beatles songs that sucked).I only could listen to about twenty seconds of "" Its all over now, baby blue"" and "" Cinnamon Girl""( two of my favorite 60's songs)...there was a real threat of my throwing my new lap-top through the wall.Gutless, ball-less,watered-down pathetic pap.Mathew Sweet and company SHOULD NOT try to tackle any song that has any power...stick to the pop-pap that you do best.The only reason it got any stars at all is the hope that mybe someone buying this dreck will seek out the original versions of the selected songs...this is great music being mutilated."
1,Has-Beens Get Desperate.......,"Yuck! As the press falls all over this record with glowing praise, you listen, and......the two words that come to mind are pedestrian and soporific. Matthew Sweet has always been a third-stringer (at least Ms. Hoffs used to be good; the Bangles' first recordings were what this record is trying to recapture) and they really don't nail any of these songs. Please skip this and spare us a Vol. 2!!!"
5,"Delightful suprising find, I cant stop listening to it","Delightful suprising find, I cant stop listening to it. This was the nicest little discovery I have made in a long time."
2,Why?,"This is a note for note reproduction of some 60's classics. If you like the songs, listen to the originals! To Matthew Sweet: why? There is no reason for this CD. Here are to fine guitarists, Richard Lloyd (formerly of Television)and Sweet and they could not put their own spin on the songs? The Zombies' Care of Cell #44 is really in need of an updated arrangement. The only value is playing this CD along with Joan Jett's [ASIN] The Hit List at a party to make your guests think they fell into an alternate universe. That said, Susanna Hoffs is a fine singer and does justice to the Velvet's Sunday Morning. If one song is worth the price of the CD, it is that song. Then again, Sweet's background vocals on the Fairport Conventions' Who Knows Where The Time Goes? really ruins the song."
2,Recording not very good,"With so many others having already given detailed reviews of this CD, there is no need for me to elaborate here. Instead, I'll just briefly say what I think is most relevant about this disc. Other reviewers have said that this disc is well-recorded. It is not. It is hard and glassy-sounding and tiring, especially when listened to on better stereo equipment, though it is less problematic on portable CD players and headphones. The music itself includes some great songs, though I did not like some of them. For what it is, this music is well enough performed here, but the recording is not very good. I'd rather have my money back."
5,Strengthen Your Faith,This particular book about the Church Fathers serves to enhance and strengthen one's understanding of the faith. A truly informative and inspirational read.
2,Not about the Church Fathers,"If you're looking for a book on the Church Fathers, this one is probably NOT what you're looking for.The aim of this book is to present church doctrine. It contains 250 headings that are chosen in accordance with the Cathechism of the Roman Catholic Church. Each one describes a point of dogma according to the Church's official teaching and offers some quotes from the ante-Nicene Fathers to support it. The point the writer is trying to make is that the teaching of today's Catholic Church doesn't differ from what the Fathers taught. If that is what you're interested in, then this book might be something for you.For me, however, it was a disappointment. Willis doesn't let the Fathers speak for themselves, and the book doesn't really give an impression of what the theology of the Fathers is all about. Willis is trying to impose a medieval or post-medieval way of presenting the Christian faith on the patristic era."
2,Tired,"I was a big fan of the early Skinner books and so I thought I'd see how the series was doing. If Gallery Whispers is anything to go by, the answer is: Not well. This book suffers from terrible telegraphing of plot points, a number of the most horribly graphic sexual scenes I've ever read, and some of the worst editing/proofreading I've seen in a very long time. To say the book is disappointing is an understatement. It's difficult to keep a series fresh, which is why my hat is off to a writer like Thomas Perry who has the sense to end a series before it becomes stale and move on. Jardine would be well advised to do the same, if Gallery Whispers is anything to go by. If you're interested in reading this author, the wisest course is to start back at the beginning with, say, Skinner's Rules.Not recommended."
3,One good song,"I got this for Two (Atmosphere Mix) by Intuition. And, that is about all I got. The rest of the CD is of songs I've never heard, and I understand why: not that interesting."
1,Big disappointment!,"I usually trust any Japanese manufacturers, however this is certainly not made in Japan. As a fact, Hoover or so has the exact same product.This vacuum cleaner makes such a loud noise that is intolerable. It has shorter cord than the discription.On board tools, one-botton cord rewind, powerhead brush with strong suction, and other features are plus. Only and the biggest drawback is the noise!I wish that I could have tried this product somewhere as a floor model before purchased; then I would have noticed the intolerable noise.I would not recommend it to anybody especially who has babies or young kids in the family. It will bother their ears..."
1,Horrible,My mom and I both bought this vacuum cleaner based on a sales recomendation. Both of our vacuum handles have broken so we cannot attach the sweeper to the top part of he hose. I would understand this could be a fluke break if it happened to just one of the vacuums but it happened to both in the exact same spot. Cheaply made. Would not buy another one again.
3,A little bit heavy,I expected small and light weight cleaner as usual Japanese cleaner but this one is a little bit larger and heavier.I don't like American style cleaner because it is too heavy to handle. This one is better than that but I want smaller.
4,Great plot twist leads to high adventure,"What do you do when your reality collapses into nothing? Your PCs (levels 5-8) will have a peculiar challenge before them - hundreds of people have becomes trapped in Skarda's Mirror, and the heroes must plunge into the realm beyond to rescue them. Of course, dealing with the fantastical world beyond, and getting everyone back out is another story entirely... a great story, and extremely challenging!"
2,"Lots of cushion, but too slippery","I loved the thickness of this mat. I was very nice and cushiony, which was great for my hard wood floors. BUT...the first time I used it my feet started to sweat a little bit and I couldn't get any traction. The foam material is not as sticky as rubber mats that I've used in yoga classes before. I returned the item for this reason....because isn't the purpose of a yoga mat to keep you from sliding around on the floor?"
4,Great for fragile bones,"I have been a yoga practitioner for six years with time on various types of mats. What was great about this mat is the extra cushioning. When it is time for down dogs or corpse pose, this mat is gentler on the hands and bones than thinner ones."
2,Reptiles in love,"I guess the book was okay, it had stickers from Goodwill and I don't buy any used products due to personal preference, so that was my oversight. I guess I just thought the book would have come used from one user, someone like me, not from a large resale shop. Again, my personal preferences."
4,Nice remakes in classical style,"I bought this for the U2 track, and it's wonderful. Great buildup and grand sound. Mancini's work makes these songs sound like classical version, not muzak. A good converse would be Royal Philharmonic Orchestra doing U2 -- totally flat, combining eletrical with classical instruments, pure muzak. Mancini on the otherhand put a lot of work on this one and maybe has a full orchestra to give it a full sound. The other 80s songs on here are done quite well. If you're a big fan of any one of the other songs it would be worth buying to hear Mancini's interpretations.The linear notes included in the CD are incorrect in places. Also, there's only 12 tracks. Imagine (11) is the last full song, the rest of the songs listed here is combined as a medley in track 12. Don't assume you're getting the full versions of the rest of the songs."
3,Not what I was looking for.,"This book seems to be very precise as far as mileage goes, but I was looking for more insight into the trail."
1,Very disapointed!,sorry to say that this CD is very poor quality and the recording seems like home recording and the singer is having a hard time keeping up with the beat.
5,Great Generator Cord,"Really high quality cord, if you have a Honda EU3000IS generator, this is the cord you need."
2,Not enough horsepower,The battery that this replaced worked in the phone for over a week when new.This battery hasn't gone past FOUR days yet and that IS with proper charging procedures. It looks like the original and it does work but it is not as strong.And I am a very low-use phone user; maybe three or four calls per day.
5,More than just a book of Poetry,"From love to life to death and betrayal, this book of poetry representsmanyexperiences of both Charles' life and others he has encountered. Hispassionand emotions spill onto the pages through free verse and rhythm alike.Fromthe destruction of A.I.D.S to the havoc that deceit can wreak upon arelationship, he leaves nothing behind.All of the subjects seem close to his heart and have made an obviousimpression on him which he easily conveys to the reader. The goal ofsomeof his more jarring pieces are not to tear down, but seek rather toexposeand rise above negativity, as an ""airplane does to a cloud.""Reviewed by Sara PriceAuthor of Sign of the Calla Lily and Rise of the Wizards"
1,How To Be A Para Pro: A Comprehensive Training Manual for Pa,"The concept of this book is a very good idea that being to train classroom support personnel to help autistic children. I'm a classroom teacher of autistic children and I attempted to use this book with my aides. After that experience, I can not recommend this book. The writing style is highly academic and very difficult for paraprofessionals to understand. A great deal of time and a good dictionary is needed to decipher what the author is trying to say. The short training time I have with my aides is better spent with material written in a plainer, easier style."
5,"""Moral victories amidst defeat""","As a resident of Ellendale, ND, the home of the college football team that's been ranked 697th out of 697 for years, I can attest that the picture painted in ""Keeping the Faith"" is so accurate, it's frightening.Most sports novels focus on a team's rise to championships or the heartache after losing the big game. This takes the opposite perspective, looking at the team that's struggling to score 30 points a season, let alone win a championship, and the only victories they can find are the ""moral victories."" Yet somehow, in a season in which every single player on the team suffered an injury, each game averaging a 0-50 loss, they manage to keep fighting and trying their hardest despite.Highly recommended."
5,Sturdy yet STYLISH!,"I have been using these sponges for years now and I don't ever see myself changing brands. There are many colors and patterns to choose from..... FUN!Very durable and just the right coarseness for the tougher jobs, no scratches! and the best soft side that creates the right amount of suds. GREAT SIZE TOO!"
4,Fair LEGO Technic Set,This set is kind of fun for a little while. I found that the purple ship did not work as well as the aqua colored one. Has 329 pieces with alot of bent liftarms. Gives a bunch of extra rubberbands. Seems expensive for what you get.
3,Just OK,"Not too much to write about this CD. I gave it three stars because it's just ok. I'm a huge Steve Laury fan but this CD just didn't do it for me. My favorite from this artist is ""Passion"" and ""Keepin the Faith CD's. Check them out."
3,Something is Missing,"This story of a great runner who had to face many of life's adversities left me wanting. From the start I had the feeling many parts of his life were being glossed over (What did it feel like to grow up in that house? Why did he quit college? How did he meet his wife?). The racing and training sequences were great. The section on his Boston Marathon was outstanding. When his injuries force him to give up running the narative gets choppy again and seems to lack insight. The farm accident was interesting, enlightening and horrifying. Much more could have been done with his descent into the world of drug addiction and the pain it caused his family (it may have been me but I never got a feel for his wife and son ). I did enjoy this book . Dik Beardsley seems like a great guy. It is an extremely fast read but it left me feeling it could have been much better."
5,Dick Beardsley's book,My husband is a marathon runner & enjoys reading. We have met Dick Bearsley when we ran the Detroit Lakes Half marathon. My husband really enjoyed this book. He learned alot about Dick Beardsley & his marathons.
3,not much to it...,"I bought this for my 2 year old. I was happy that it wasn't huge--fits right in the corner. She loved it when she first got it for Christmas. HOWEVER, My complaints are...everything is just SO small and inefficient! The ""microwave"" is so high that she can't even reach it with a small stool I bought for her to use just for the kitchen! The back of the little bins are open, and you can't store ANYTHING in there. So, I don't know where they came up with the lots of storage line! I just expected a little bit more of a kitchen--would have changed some of the features. OVERALL it has proven to be a fun toy, but hard to use unless you are really tall!"
5,Cute Kitchen!,"My daughter recieved this kitchen today, and she absolutely loves it! The bins on the left side really need a back on them so that things don't fall out. I would recommend putting this toy together with a ratchet equipped with a screwdriver bit adapter otherwise you will have a sore wrist because it takes a while to get the screws through the thick plastic parts. This toy is definately designed to be durable. I am sure it can withstand whatever my daughter could do to it. Overall I think it is a good investment and a very cute toy."

2,So bad it's GOOD!,"One of the worst action, war, and Kong fu films ever made, but with the best story line. This ""prequel"" was made before MISSING IN ACTION. Thisfilm - so bad it's good - is from the same filmmakers who gave us other 'so bad it's good' films like OVER THE TOP and DELTA FORCE. MISSINGIN ACTION 3 is somewhat better, but it's nothing you haven't seen a 100 times before.1985. MGM. 136 MINS."
3,The Beginning is all Comic Book Fantasy.,"Missing in Action 2: The Beginning tells the tale of how James Braddock and a select few were captured, then tortured, and finally escaped (...) Vietcong. It's 100% jingoistic revenge fantasy as Braddock eventually busts loose, then heads. Soon Tek Ho plays a villain so cartoonishly evil you wonder why the filmmakers did not give him an eyepatch, facial scar, and a handle bar moustache to twirl as he cackles with sadistic glee. Formula fun for Norris fans only."
3,Good for the price,"The picture on the package shows more then 15 water wiggles, which made me think you can connect them together. So I purchased two of them, just to find out that they don't. I got wet more then the children trying to keep the thing straight. But since it was hot it didn't bother me. My children didn't think it was that much fun after playing with it two to three times, especially the 7 and 8 year old's. I have four children, would of loved to have had it longer"
2,"doesn really work, broken","I bought mine at a retail store (W-Mart). it sounded good but it really doesnt work . I found the little orange feet don't stat put ( they can be adjusted)fall off and/or the hose/actaully small blue tubing twists in all sort of directions rendering the whole hose useless because it shoots all over the place....its a goodidea and kids like the wiggly action but it didnt last very long....before the problems arise... also...after a little more time....the little wiggles hoses pop out and then you have a gyser(s) instead of a a little wiggle hose... so it sprays everywhere...I would recommend trying another produst, or just by a greaan arden hose that has holes in it...that would last much longer with more reliable output...albeit without the wiggles...."
2,"Fun, albeit troublesome, deceiving and unpredictable","I bought this item at a much lower price at a national retailer (Wal-mart). I had purchased it b/c the packaging made it look like it was much larger than it is. The orange ""things"" that are supposed to hold the sprinkler down are worthless. They are manufactured to open. Why? I don't know. But it is quite a hassle to keep them closed and stabilized on the ground. The ""hose"" that runs through these ""orange things"" can be slightly twisted in order to keep the sprinklers that wiggle sprinkling in the direction you want them to sprinkle, usually up. But you do have to ""mess"" with it each time you set it up and sometimes during play, so make sure you don't mind getting wet along with your kiddos when you turn it on. :) It is fun, once you get the ""kinks"" worked out."
2,I returned it to the store,"I purchased this last week and have already returned it. There is no way to keep the sprinkler spouts straight up or angled. Some of them shoot right into the grass, not up or at an angle. If there was some kind of weight to keep the main tube flat to the ground, I think it would work a lot better. I don't agree with the age recommendation of 5+. I think 4 and under is more precise."
2,Hardly a page turner,"I want to make it perfectly clear. I read Cutter's Paper Mage and loved it. So, eager to see what she could do with two of my favorite groups (wide representation applied) of people (Toltec/Mayan/Aztec civilizations and Scandinavian raider culture) the book was purchased. Jaguar and the Wolf just doesn't seem to go anywhere or to have a clear purpose or reason for being written. There is little character development, growth, plot, etc... Although there are some interesting parts, for the most part it lacks the history and thoughtfulness seen in Paper Mage.They can't all be good reviews..."
2,Historical Fiction,"""Jaguar and the Wolf"" follows two people: a young lady from South America and a Viking warrior. These two people (who soon meet) struggle between obeying societies dictates and controling the course of their lives. There are mystic elements, but this book could better be categorized as historical fiction. All of the effort spent on historic accuracy left me borred.I recommend you try Cutter's other books instead. However, if you enjoy historical fiction, you'll probably adore ""The Jaguar and the Wolf""."
3,Good Book!,"This was a good TB book, but WHERES WONDER! Shes the main horse, my favorite, for four books, then bam, she is, without and explanation, hurt and ppusheed out of the picture. I think a whole book could have been writen about Wonders injury, and retirement, and Pride too. Goddess and Sammy are great, but Ashleigh and Wonder are better. STill, this is a must for all TB readers. Great book..."
1,What!,I read this book and was confused at the end. They don't explain how the rest of Fleet Goddess's career goes. They just go on to Samantha and forget about Godess until she has her first baby! What is up with that!
5,An interesting twist on the Thoroughbred series,"In which Ashleigh cannot continue to train her new special filly, and in which Samantha McLean takes over behind her father's back in desperation."
5,Shows you courage !!!!!!!,I loved the realisticness. It was an excellent book I liked it better than the first one !!!!!!
5,"Not actually white, but still very nice","If you have pure white sheets on your bed you will notice that the white comforter is actually a very light grey color. This really bothered me at first because I often don't like using duvet covers because they make the comforter too hot for me. But after using the comforter for a month I have to say that it's so soft, fluffy and just heavenly that I don't care that it's grey. The fabric is delicious. I'm really happy with this product and am now ordering a down robe from this company."
4,Love it!!,"This comforter is just what I was looking for. It is so fluffy and soft. This only problem I have, is that the size is a little smaller than stated, which is why I took one star away. I have black furniture and gray walls, this is the only white in the room. I put a good quality white duvet on it and have 4 regular, and two euro pillows on the bed. It looks like a room that you see in magazines now! I only use down comforters and was very afraid of spending this much, but I am not sorry!"
4,Supremium Goose Down Comforter,"Bought the twin size even though I have a double bed. The double bed's head and foot board would have interfered with the length dimensions of the double/queen size comforter. The twin size dimension fit perfectly and was more than $100 cheaper. Even as winter has not come on full blown, I expect that the comforter will perform as well as it has on those extra cool fall nights. No complaints here."
1,Unsanitary Down,"After poor experiences with lower cost down comforters, I was looking forward to a rewarding experience when I ordered Warm Things' Supremium comforter at a price of over $300. However when I received their Supremium comforter it had a noticeable odor, which became so strong when I spread it out on my bed that I had to return it! But Warm Things says they won't accept my return because I removed the tag! Clearly they are otherwise preparedSupremium Baffle Box Medium Weight White Goose Down Comforter White Queento resell this putrid smelling comforter to someone else! The down in the comforter I got was obviously unsanitary. My Warm Things comforter stinks, and apparently so are their ethics."
5,The Perfect Choice for me,"I have had a lot of problems with other manufactures but this time finally got the right one for my needs. The smell of eucalyptus is so pleasing. The delivery of the package was very quick and arrived within 5 days,I was expecting it to take up to 15 days. I would certainly order from this seller again."
3,no lake detail,"lake greenwood chart, sc looks like a ROAD map ! that's not what I thought I was getting when I purchased the inland lake software ! it shows the bottom right under the boat very well, but not where I want to go. does anybody know where I can find a unit with lake greenwood bottom detail ? other than this, I like the unit. thanks, gt"
3,"Not 1 1/2""","Although the ring pull is advertised as being 1 1/2""Dia. It is really closer to 1 9/16""Dia. which made the 1 1/2""Dia. recesses I drilled useless. Good thing they were in a test piece not the finished drawer front."
4,"So, this is QFT?","I never had a formal QFT course in my life, so I was curious to learn it on my own. My curiosity was only incresed by what is called ""QFT methods in condensed matter physics"", which I am exposed to quite a bit.The book by Mandl and Shaw is certainly easy to read. In my case I obtained some idea about how the diagrammatic techniques look in covariant form. However, many questions I had had are still left unanswered. While it is obvious that the book is out of date, and it is hard to blame the authors for that, there is no even brief overview of the field and the basic problems it faced in that period. There is no mentioning of the approaches altenative to diagrammatic techniques. In general, the book is not very systematic, but rather present more detailed solutions for several problems that the reader is assumed to be already familiar with. Therefore, I assume, the book is good only as a supplementary material for those studying diagrammatic methods for QFT."
3,Not what I had in mind,"While I am sure the Hanging rope is a great product, buyers should be aware (as I was not) that you are ordering ONE rope. This of course means you will still need something else to hold up the other end of your hammock."
3,a bit to techie-oriented,"I felt this was a fairly interesting account, but hardly expected such a specifically (and laborious) technical blueprint, of the development environments, computer languages etc. etc. used in the creation of the WWW. I was hoping for a bit more of a broader brush painted in this area (not half of the book!)... Worth reading only for the types of people that are not bored silly by this stuff... 2.5 stars"
2,An important work - but a snoozer in presentation,"I bought this book based on recommendations from colleagues and academics who've referenced it. I accept the importance of the author and his account of developing the web. However, I find the presentation unreadable - despite trying hard, I was never able to drudge through the techno-babble and self-aggrandizing to get to the punchline. Possibly interesting for history buffs and those immersed in the internet, but not particularly useful or revealing for others."
3,"too long, too detailed","This book gives a very detailed account of the uphill battle the author had to fight in his invention. While this could be interesting to a student of organizational management, it's kind of boring for the average reader. The book could accomplish its goal in half the length."
1,Delusions of grandeur,"Despite this man's claim's, he did not create the web as we know it. The web originated as a resource in which scientists could share information over vast distances--much more efficient than standard mail. HTTP evolved from a working group that hammered out the details and finally agreed on a standard. Thus the Protocol in httP. This book is a money-making scheme."
4,An excelent book about the web history and future.,"This is a great book. It explains in details how the web concept evolved. I think Tim Berners-Lee couldn't tell it better. Personally, I'd never realized how such subject emerged just in a high-energy physics lab. Tim in Weaving The Web helped me to understand that. It's clear that there was no Eureka moment. The Web came from a set of rambling thoughts. Beyond history facts Tim gives us the possibility of getting the Web from a social perspective. Further, there is a interesting and curious discussion about its future. I recommend it strongly."
4,If you build it ....,Excellent review of the history of the Web. The book is most helpful however when looking at Berner-Lees' vision of what the Web can be and why we want to get there.
4,Internet and the Web,"Fantastic man to listen to and read about. It would seem that joncolis@yahoo.com is getting confused with the words ""Web"" and ""Internet""."
3,Dacians and Germans,This is a bit of a disappointment; rather dated and not very scholarly. There are better reference works out there.
4,This is a love story...with a sting in the tail,"It's about a life together that could have been perfect, but for a secret.The book's `blurb' warns of disaster, but there's no hint while you're reading it when or who it will strike. The story accelerates and events suddenly spin out of control. There are lots of interesting twists in the storytelling but the final twist (and sting) comes out of the blue - my only criticism is that it is a bit far fetched, and though you feel sorry for the characters, you're not entirely sure you should.Although the book is unevenly paced it didn't at any point lose my interest."
3,An excellent tv-drama,"This is a very interesting and well-acted tv-drama. A gripping tale of love, fear, and violence. Although, i dont glorify Fawcett's character in killing her husband, i can relate to the pains and troubles he caused her.However, Farrah's performance, i reckon was over-hyped by the media and critics --from angel to battered wife!!!!, etc... Any other actress better than Ms. Fawcett can give justice to the role and definitely better. It's a revelation to see her with out her usual cover girl make-up and that's what people saw -- and that's acting?--so, just enjoy this film as a whole and forget about Ms. Fawcett ""battered acting make-up"" because you know it's just acting."
2,"Good,but it was the usual ""men bad,women good ""movie","This movie was good,but it was the usual,run-of-the-mill ""men bad,women good"" movie.Like ""Enough"",the acting was good,but the storyline was just another ""abusive husband"" thing..."
3,A bummer if you read the book,"The movie would have been better if I hadn't read the book. The ordeal that Francine went through in real life was significantly down played in the movie. If you have already read the novel, the movie will be a big disappointment for you. If you haven't read the book, do so after watching the movie."
4,Must see for all young women,"This movie made me realize how far women's rights have come, and the fact that stories like this still happen makes me realize how far we still have to go.To those reviewers who say the ending is unrealistic, I would like to point out that this is a true story. You can't get more realistic than that."
2,poor quality,"the movie ""THE BURN BED"" is a excellent movie. it is a tear jerkier. the movie came out in 1980's and the film looks that old when watching the movie, sad. i still watched the movie because, it is such a good movie. the cover of the VHS is newer then the picture of the movie. the cover is brand new. the video was poor quality."
5,The Burning Bed,Farrah Fawcett is just great in this movie. Telling the story of what happen to led up to the death of her husband is just breath taking.
5,The Burning Bed,"As always, Farrah does an excellent job (she will be missed dearly). The story hits home to many people and is presented in a manner that is as truthful as you will find. Excellent!!"
4,Claustrophobic,"This DVD runs about 95 minutes and along with English also contains a Spanish audio track as well as subtitles in English, Spanish, and French. I felt claustrophobic while watching this movie, but obviously that was the intent of this story. A wife who could not escape the death-grip of her controlling and violent husband.While the husband is a sick-bastard, Francine(Fawcett) does make some bad choices that help continue her trauma. Since this movie was made in the mid-80's, there are some familiar faces that you usually see popping up in made-for-tv movies from the late-70's till the mid-80's. Good but depressing movie."
5,BeyOnd SuRpRiSed!!!,I was very surprised about this product I was expecting maybe some problems only cause it wasnt from the store but there wasnt any problems Im very satisfied and looking forward to more of my movies to come in...
1,Only you can change it,"HiI watched this movie many times. Over and over and this particular movie opened my eyes to what I been thru.I was in a very bad marriage my self, I thought I had to go back for the kids but I was wrong. We all just look for excuses however we should never have to go through any of this. When a man hits a woman he is in control.We women have to put an end to this. There were times when I thought I was taking my last breath but one day I had enough. I got so strong I was able to hit him back. Now I'm divorced and happier than ever. It took me six years but I'm still alive. But there are women out there that don't get the chance to make it out a live. To every women out there who gets abused, please watch this movie and take a good look at your self, you can make it out alive. Thanks for reading.Lady Undercover."
3,Probally a biased opinion as it is set in my home town?,"This film was basically the pilot episode for the British dectective series ""Madoc"", it is not particularly great but it is not terrible either. It is the story of a detective in persuit of a serial killer in the small Welsh university town of Aberystwyth (I saw most of it being filmed).As I say it's not great but it is well cast, Hywel Bennett is particularly good."
3,Big Money,"I received the CD ""Recycle"" and was disappointed to find the song ""Big Money"" was not on the disk. I bought the CD because I wanted the song ""Big Money"". There should be a way to describe a CD with the correct songs that are on that disk so that the buyer, who is not able to view the physical product, receives what he is paying for without having to worry about false advertising."
1,An awful and self serving betrayal of a very important pianist,"There is nothing much to say about this contemptible betrayal of a personal trust. This is an awful book that deserves to be avoided at all costs. Better you should pick up a copy of Harold Schonberg's ""Horowitz - His Life and Music"". I am certainly not the first or hundredth to find this book awful beyond belief. Please avoid it and turn to something other than this self-serving waste of trees."
3,Read the trilogy and kept hope alive.....,"But I am baffled at with self hatred of Larry Deplechan as an African American writer. I would much rather read his auto biography to understand his twisted views on the world. He is a great writer and Captain Swing is no dount a well written piece, but from Johnny Rae's obsession with white men, to his low view of just about every black person is all 3 books, to his twisted sexual relationship with his blood cousin and a justification that could only come from the author's own true personal feelings, I don't know whether to applaud him for being so bold or reccommend him getting his head checked."
1,Filter not for a 1998 Malibu,This filter I purchased is NOT for a 1998 Malibu. It's not even close! For anybody that's buying any type of filter should double check the filter type before purchasing.
5,Truly a wonderful book!,This book is as wonderful as the other reviewers claim. It's just a perfect book of historic doll quilts. I was quite upset to have found it out of print and very expensive to buy used. I went to the publisher's web site to see if I could view samples to determine if it would be worth the high cost third party sellers are charging. Imagine my excitement to find it offered as an Adobe download for less than the original cost of the book when in print! Yippee! I thought I would pass this discovery along.Enjoy!
1,American Girl Doll Quilt Book,"It was a photo copy and did not have the glossy pictures I expected that had been in other books by this publisher and author. I talked with the publisher and they said it was an Amazon problem. Ask questions and I would never accept a ""print on demand"" book even though this book was not advertised as such. Very disappointed and frustrated over this purchase!"
3,I'm not a remix person.,"Sorry, but I'm not into remixy albums. I feel no different here, as this is just some remix waste of time with a grand total of two cool tracks. However, considering the amount of tracks on the album (Six? I think) I guess that's worth three stars. I really should hope that if your new to SMG you don't start with some remix album like this. Find a well rated full length (remix free) album and you'll be rewarded with some hard hitting industrial rock music that never sold out."
4,Good Guide to Israel,"I found this to be a good comprehensive guide during my trip to Israel: helpful information about how to get around, good maps, a lot of historical/political background, and a very nice format. It has quite a bit of detail in it and some witty editorials. If you're looking for something more general, with less reading, the Rough Guide is also quite good."
1,Sorry. It is anti-semitic and it is notably anti-Israeli,"Maybe even pro-Palestinian. There is no doubt that anyone having problems with Yad Vashem (as this author does, arguing that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem should not have been included in the exhibit, never mind that he was a major reason Jews could not go to Palestine to escape the holocaust) has to be at least a bit anti-semitic and anti-Israel There are other problems in this guide. Having been in Israel many times before, I agree that this guide has many items other guides do not have. But the tone and the bias of the author is hard to overlook. I suggest you look elsewhere for a more balanced view. All in my opinion, of course. I'd have preferred giving it no stars."
4,Seems to me like a good read,"I was encouraged to read this by a colleague of mine and, at first, I was hesitant: I'm not one to read a lot of fiction/fantasy. I finally gave in and I have to admit I rather enjoyed it. The build up was slow but neccesary to set the tone and atmosphere for the plot. There's a sense of emptiness at the end of the book but at the same time a deep, burdoning understanding that civilizations fall by the simplest of means."
4,Fram Air Hog,Looks like a reasonable air filter for the price. Time will tell but I anticipate this filter should be satisfactory for our application on our Jeep Grand Cherokee. Shipping was Amazon quick as usual.FRAM PPA7440 Air Hog Panel Filter
1,DO not buy to read on kindle,This was totally unreadable on my Kindle Fire... and when I did get it to open on my computer the information is too dated to be any good for my purposes. A T- TOTAL waste of time.
5,A taste Of Baba Ram...,"For those of us that have grown up with the 'rent a mouth' of spiritual journeys it is a sweet walk through his lectures in brief. For someone new to his fine soul, it is a good collection of commen sense & thoughts to ponder."
3,"Great, quick one-liners!","This is by no means ""life-changing"", but if you've been down the ""spiritual path"" for some time and have read enough books or had enough experiences, these one-liners will be quick refreshers to snap you back into your essential core of being. It's great for the tabletop for guests to flip through, or for you to keep somewhere where you frequently pass throughout the house. It's always nice to pick it up, read a quick liner, and be on with your day. Would I buy it again? Yes!"
2,Lackluster; not the same after Broadley left,"I have to agree with the ""dull"" comment below. While the song list sounded great, the performances just lacked something, and that was lead singer/arranger Sharon Broadley. This was their first album without her and it showed."
4,Quite interesting,"The book has 3 incantation texts in the original Syriac, with translation into French and a good critical apparatus. Obviously, it's not on the bestseller list, but for those interested in Syriac the texts are quite interesting."
4,The Last of a dieing breed!!!,"M.O.P is the last hardcore group left in newyork.Firt of all,it is rare to have a group who never compromised or never dropped a wack album.Second,I give the group major props for taking the risk in today's climate of music to make a rock album.When I heard the first track I knew this album was going to be earth shattering! I blasted this album so loud my speakers blew!This is the type of album MIKE TYSON can make his ring entrance too.MASH OUT POSSE IS M.O.P hardest album to date ande has Legendary Status written all over it.The song ""FIRE"" will have you wilding-yall not ready!!!"
2,M.O.P. Does Not Rock,"I have always enjoyed M.O.P.'s aggressive style, so naturally hard guitar rifts with their lyrics would seem to go hand in hand. Unfortunately, this CD didn't do it for me. I heard a promotional copy before hearing the CD that featured six of the album's tracks with different beats. It was awesome. Then I listened to the retail version and the beats just weren't as good. `Stand Clear', which was originally featured on an Adam F project, was one of my favorite M.O.P. songs. This version butchered it and showed it no justice. `Ante Up' (listed as `Robbin' Hoodz' here), their most famous single to date, was also butchered. If you want to hear hip hop to hard guitars then you might as well put on an old Beastie Boys record.(1.5/5 mics)"
4,Nice Set for 1-3 Campers,"The quality of this set is great: heating seemed even and the non-stick surface made washing easy. My only complaint is that the pots are a bit smaller than I expected, so for a recent 5-person camping trip, some things had to be cooked in batches."
3,A hijacking and extortion novel - with a real twist,Though dated (it was written in 1975) I found this book quite a fun read. The story cuts to and fro between the search for a vietnam pilot lost in action and what he's really doing while everyone is looking for him. The story was clearly written before full details of the harrier jump-jet were released which leads to some big plot holes but it has some lovely twisty ideas in it.The cover blurb (...story whose artful misdirection will keep your attention rivetted until the very end.) is true!
2,"Popular approach, but not Biblically supported!","Koivisto has spent time looking into this difficult topic of Christian fellowship. Sounds so modern to look for a core, a common denominator to sort out all the multitudes of Christian voices on this doctrine and that. Although he unsuccessfully attempts to refute Sasse's valid historical view that there never has been a golden time of unity in the church, he proceeds to find a core orthodoxy which achieves this minimal threshold of God-pleasing belief. Returning to Vincent of Lerins and others, he feels this is it. However, he makes no effort to refute the Bibical admonition to find such unity in all of God's words, e.g. John 17 and Mt. 28:20. To read another opinion, try The Church, by Kurt Marquart."
3,Yes/No,"I bought 2 and contrary to what some other reviewers said I haven't found any defective ones.The filters do capture Tar and don't seem to affect taste.The reason for 3 stars is that I bought them to help me quit smoking but so far that part hasn't had a direct effect. It did get me paying attention to my smoking and I have realized that it has a lot to do with my behavior. Behavior that has developed over time and I suppose that it will take time to stop by breaking my behavioral habits one at a time. Here are a few examples. Smoke when I wake up, have coffee, after a meal, when I get in the car, when I take a break, while waiting, in the john etc. etc. etc.With that said:1) The product does what it claims and does capture Tar.2) Doesn't affect taste.3) None that I got were defective."
4,TarGard mini filters,"I can't smoke a cigarette with out using the filter anymore I was hoping it would help more with quitting smoking, But the tar it stops is worth it..... After about 4 cigarettes the filter is black and gross, I can't imagine Getting that crap in my lungs anymore...."
3,"Good, not great",It was annoying to put on and I had to suck too hard. But it did take up so much of the tar.
3,TAR GUARD CIGARETTE FILTER,"Works great altho I do not use them as a tar guard, I take the little orange filter out then I use them only to keep the cigarette from stickin to my lip. Really should have a choice to not have the orange filter in them."
2,defective filters,These filters do blockout tar & nicotine without changing the flavor but I have a small collection of defective filters in my drawer from the bulk bag i bought The nic out & magic 25 are far more superior filters
2,Not So Much,"I ordered these for my Mom who isnt interested in quiting smoking but still wants to cut back on the chemicals and tar from cigarettes. These got to her quickly, and fit on her particular brand of cigarette just fine, but they did not seem to help. You really have to take a heavy drags when using these tips in order to get a suffecient amount of smoke and afterwards there really isnt any visible residue. Great idea, not so great a product. This is not to say ALL tips do not work, just these particular ones."
3,"Good concept, but poor quality bulk item","I have been a smoker for years. Then I came across with these cigarette filters. I tried magic 25 first, then I saw this bulk bag at a more convenient price. I bought it. To my surprise, I had to throw away about 25 filters from each 100 filter bag I'd purchased. The filters were either not properly pierced at the mouth end or the orange part, which functions as a filter itself was missing. What a waste! To me, the concept is awesome; however, buying in bulks instead of smaller presentations, gave me a pretty bad first impression. Wanna try it out, go ahead! Maybe I have not been as lucky as those consumers who pasted no comments on this regards..."
3,Effective but limited,"The three-star rating is a compromise. I give it five stars for effectiveness and one star for longevity. The device collects plenty of gunk, but in my experience the mouthpieces chamber is too small to hold the waste of more than 2 to 2 1/2 100 mm cigarettes.An overflowing mouthpiece leaves a bitter taste in the mouth and irritated lips. For those reasons, I much prefer the larger TarGard.The mini filters can be reused. Just place a dozen filters in a small bottle and add enough alcohol to cover them. Swirl the bottle's contents several times during a 24-hour period (vigorous shaking will dislodge the red inserts inside the filters). Then flood the bottle with water, drain the liquid and dump the filters on paper towels. Remove excess water by blowing on the mouthpiece."
5,Very effective!,Wow. This product is easy to use and gets my dogs attention immediatly even on low settings. The range is great and the batteries last a long time between charges. I have used it for over a month now and it has made off leash training a breeze and my dog is now more responsive to my voice even when he isnt wearing the collar!
4,Worked well,"Bought to prevent dog from eating feces. We had had an electric fence, so dog knew about beeps & shocks. Never had to use the shock part. Dog came back quickly to prevent being shocked - beeps are loud enough to be heard from a short distance. Long hair (Golden retreiver) prevented blinking light to always show, so sometimes it stayed on all night; easy to recharge."
3,Great Product,I think this is a great product. It has stopped the dog from barking in the car while I'm driving.Working on him chasing cats at this time. The charge seems to take longer then 12 hours before it starts blinking that it is charged. I did not recharge it when I had only used it for a couple ofhours one day and it lost its charge the next day. It needs to be charged everyday no matter howlittle it is used. Other then that I think it is a great product is seems to be working well.
4,great product,"this has helped reign in my stubborn, do what she wants rescue pet. it was a real shocker for her to finally conform to the rules and obey. this thing has great range. my cons are the excessive length of the collar with no securing/binding fitting and the must remove method to recharge the collar."
2,Battery dead,Love the idea of this.But must have stayed on the shelffor too long battery is having problemsnot keeping a charge. I already cut thecollar to fit Buddy and doubt it willbe able to be returned. NOT satisfiedwith the product. Amazon is great.
1,Started out good,This product started out to be the best thing I have ever purchased for a pet. After 2 weeks the unit stopped working so I called customer service and they sent out a new receiver. The new receiver worked for two days and then quit working again. So I am sending this one back for a refund and will step up to the Dogtra brand. I have heard they are a better unit.
1,Malfunctioning,I have purchased an returned 4 of these units from Petsmart. They all were malfunctioning out of the box. I am very tech-saavy and I was using the product correctly. Customer service walked me through the correct procedures and agreed that the products were defective. After purchasing 4 bad devices in a row I am done with this company.
3,Battery life is very poor,"It's an excellent tool for training so long as the batteries are charged. They lose their charge quickly. Don't rely on it to keep your dog under control, you should have a backup just in case it stops working."
2,Battery issues,This is a great product -while it works! Within 6 moths after buying the product (or ten times of usage) the collar stopped working due to some issue with the battery charging.
4,Training lifesaver,"I purchased this product for my 100 lb. Doberman. I was having problems with him when cats were around, he would become so fixated on the cat and wouldn't respond to any commands. I am very impressed with the quality of this product, it seams to be very sturdy and well built and it works every time. My dog understood very quickly that if he didn't stop the behavior when told No that he was going to get shocked. Now I very rarely have to shock him, most times re responds to the verbal command right away. I strongly recommend this over a choke or pinch collar. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the actual collar material seamed a little cheesy but so far it's holding up well."
5,great collar,"This collar is well made and works like a champ. The different modes are great and allow me to do beeps or just the stimulation. I bought it to stop my dog from barking. The only problem i have is that she's too smart, she knows when it's on and won't bark but as soon as it comes off she will. So now i just leave it on her when she goes outside and the problem is fixed."
2,No charge?,"I've trained all kinds of dogs, from shih tzus to huskies to collies with great success. But when my german shepherd came along, I was presented with a huge challenge - a profoundly stubborn 80lb girl with 'alpha issues'. I finally decided to get this remote trainer. It was very effective on her. I don't use the shock function; I just created positive and negative associations with the tones. It was working very well. The only problem is, the darn thing won't hold a charge for more than an hour. And Murphy's law dictates that every time she is performing an unwanted behavior, I press the button ... and yup, not a darn thing happens. So the training lacks any form of consistency .... which is of course, how a dog learns. Such a shame :("
4,Petsafe PDT00-10603 Yard and Park Remote Trainer,Our 2 year old shepherd had a bad habit of chasing our horses. Once we started using the collar he stopped this habit in less then one week. We really wish we had started using the collar much earlier. We feel this product has most likely added years to our dogs life.
3,"Good Collar, Bad Battery","I bought this collar in January. It works great as long as the battery is charged. 9 months later, it takes about 12 hours to charge and lasts about 24 hours.This summer we did have problems with it rubbing our dog's neck raw when it was very warm outside.And of course the dog has figured out when he doesn't have the collar on he can get away with doing things he shouldn't.So if you need continuous coverage, you might consider buying two collars."
2,Worked for about a year.,"This was a great collar for about a year. After that the whole thing just stopped working.Contacted Petsafe, ordered new batteries... toast. So I bought a Dogtra to replace it and love that one more.Before it died it was a pretty good collar. My only problems were with the transmitter and the collar not communicating all the time. I had to reset it multiple times. Within a few months of use, it was kind of unreliable, thankfully it was just a backup measure when we were out in the field, just in case my dog started to chase some critter.Spend the extra money for a Dogtra collar. While this is an OK collar for a few more bucks you can get a collar that is much better."
5,good,"Excellent product. I would google it for recommendations on how to responsibly and effectively use this product. Range is good, hasn't failed me once."
2,Not Reliable,"OK had to redo my review. Here we are about 3 months later and the product has become unreliable. Go to the Pet Safe website and you will see many negative reviews for the same reason. It was wonderful when it worked, but it is trash now and I hope to get my money back. No matter what you do, charge it over and over etc. the controler stops working so the collar is worthless."
2,Range is not 400 yards,"Bought this product about a week ago. It worked wonderfully for about that week, but after I recharged it last night, it now does not want to work properly. The remote only works now if you are standing right next to the collar, and stops working as soon as you step beyond 10 yards. Will be returning this product for a full refund."
2,stopped working after 7 months,"This started working great; the dog responds very well to just the tone after only a couple small initial shocks. However, after having this for about 7 months, it has stopped working. So now I'm being forced to find another one."
1,piece of chinese junk,This collar looks great- the collar and remote both seem to be built well. The problem is that it just doesn't work. The functions quit working about 10 minutes after I started using it. This is another example of cheap junk from china that is flooding the USA. Don't buy it!
2,Disappointed,"The unit that hangs around the neck is very heavy. So heavy, in fact, that I have not used it so far. Also, I did not expect to have to shave the neck to create a contact for the two prongs that are supposed to make contact. This is not at all what I expected."
4,Decent Product,"We are using this in place of our electric fence. Our electric fence was struck by lightning for the 6th time and we finally gave up! This collar works well, but the battery life is not quite long enough...it is made more for just short trips with the collar, not ALL DAY like we use it. It has served its purpose though and we are happy, for the most part!"
4,training collar,"The instructions to use this product has been a bit tedious, but overall the product appears to be working well. We are gradually using it more and more with our puppy with good results."
5,Great training colllar!,"This product does exactly what it says, our 5 year old dog is much more obedient thanks to this collar, after only a few uses. She understands the beeps and shocks,and stays close to us when walking. Great product!"
5,PetSafe - Great customer service,I purchased the Yard and Park Trainer for my dog. It worked better than a competitors product I purchased. It has great range for suburbia. After 2 months the receiver stopped holding the programming. Petsafe shipped me a new receiver in 2 days! No charge to me. Now that is customer service! The Yard and Park trainer is the right size & range for my little dog.
3,training collar,We have 6 month Shar Pei puppy. They are known for being a very stubborn breed. She would just ignore everything up to the 8 setting but when when reset to 10 she started coming when called....after 2 days she was a perfect little girl. I think the setting and resetting could be easier and the positive tone seemed to confuse her. After we omitted the positve tone and kicked it up to 10 it was easy.
4,Work Great!,"Would have given it five stars, but I have not had it long enough to go that far. So far it had been great. For those of you who feel it is tough on the dog (as I was concerned) not to worry. The charge is not enough to even make the dog yelp - it is just an attention getter. It is more gentle then some of the choke collars I see people using. The dog learns quick and you don't have to shock them often - there is a warning tone that lets them know it is coming, and that is generally sufficient to get them to come back to you. Great tool - probably saved my dog from getting hit by a car or causing an accident. Worth every penny.Dan C."
3,Was Great product -now OK 12/12,"Still training the dog but this collar has been fantastic. Now, with the collar on, the dog listens 100% to voice commands and I no longer need to even use the tone button let alone the zap button. Huge improvement after only 3 days of use and much easier to walk or run with the dog. I use the dial setting on 1 now just because it really is no longer needed.Had to update review because in two years, I had two of these stop working. The first one was replaced by the manufacturer with relative ease. Now the second one stopped working after one year and I have to go through talking with them again. For two to go bad in two years makes me suspicious of the quality. These are not cheap! Even though they have a one year warranty, I wouldn't expect them to fail in one year. Especially since my dog does not swim so they are always kept dry. - 12/29/12"
4,A thinking woman's Bridget Jones,"Good summer reading/chick lit! First-person story about a woman who doesn't know how to express negative feelings to people around her because of how she's been raised as a woman (I can identify!) & how she works through that. Believable & likeable characters with pyschological depth & humor. If you like Bridget Jones, you'll like this even more; it has great humor & characters, but is more satifying & interesting because it addresses issues of body image & the impact it has on women with more depth. I *LOVED* the use of the unreliable narrator, but it's hard to me to say what I loved so much about it without giving away a spoiler. Let's just say that it was interesting being put in the head of someone who is herself clueless--and have us not figure out what's going on until she herself does (I didn't see what was coming until I got to it). At the core is a woman learning to find her own voice--but she has to go through a lot of bad choices to get there!"
4,Addictive & Hysterical,I was drawn to this book after reading & loving Getting Over IT. Anna Maxted is definitely a fave of mine now. She writes in such a way that when I finish the book I feel as though I lost some friends. Every character is true to life & hysterically funny. She's very raw & blunt which makes her books really comical and twisted at times!Though the middle of the book took a surprisingly weird twist that I didn't remember reading in the 1st half of the book - it seemed to flow anyway.I recommend this book for any Getting OVer IT fans!!
3,Not Bad....not great!!!!!,"""Running in Heels"" wasn't all that bad. It dragged on a bit...Natalie was a self-focused young twit. I found myself wandering away from it for days on end....seemed as though her first book was much more interesting to me. I will read her next book...improvement comes with practice."
1,What a diappointment,"I loved, LOVED, Getting Over It and recommended it to all my friends. I couldn't even get through this book - I sold it on Amazon when I got to chapter four. The characters were so uninteresting, the story - well, I couldn't care less about anything that happened, so I guess it was pretty bad. I wish Maxted's second book was as great as her first - this one wasn't funny, silly, insightful, honest - UGH! I'll still read her third when it comes out and hope it's more on par with her first effort."
5,Another Amazing Hit!!,"I love Anna Maxted's work. She's such a talented and gifted storyteller. ""Getting Over It"" (her first work) is one of my favs and I have been eagerly anticipating her next novel. I was not disappointed. The levels and characters in this book are wonderful. She tells a story with such intelligence, care and thoughtfulness. I really enjoy her pace and character development. The story goes deeper than the usual ""modern romance"" and makes you work harder. You will completely enjoy this book - and feel satisfied with a job well done. I highly recommend it."
2,Newsflash: Natalie hates herself for nearly 300 pages...,"I couldn't wait to read this book - and I should have. Anna Maxted is a truly talented writer who, with Natalie, has created one of the most unsympathetic characters I've spent time with recently. If you're prepared to wallow along with Natalie in self-loathing and self-doubt, this is the book for you; we spend page after page watching Natalie's unrelieved downward spiral. Getting Over It was delightful because Helen's hapless foibles were like our own, but Running In Heels was a well-written bummer."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"After being captivated by Maxted's writing the first for the first 1/4th of the book, I had to force myself to finish reading the rest of it and was ultimately disappointed. The book's cover misled me to believe that the book was about the main character's reaction to her best friend's new marriage -- an identifiable situation for many readers, right? I would feel sorry for anyone who has a friendship as lacking in communication as the one portrayed in this book. In any case, the book wasn't really about the friendship. It was about ... well, I'm still not sure if there was any real focus to the book other than the tedious semi-recovery and self-realization of a really pathetic and unlikeable main character in need of some serious therapy. I am sorry to have wasted my time and money on this one."
2,What a downer!!,"I was so excited to see that Anna Maxted had a new book out, I snatched it off the shelf in a nanosecond. The sleeve will have you believe it's a story about a girl coming to terms with her best friend's marriage. Ummm...maybe for the first 10 pages anyway. It quickly turns into a depressing, confusing, and muddled plot line of a story with a character so unlikable, you'll wish there was a sequel to In the Drink to cheer you up. Even the friendship between Natalie and Babs is hard to understand. It seems like they hate each other. Frannie? Wait, wasn't she Rebecca in the Helen Fielding novels? Don't be fooled by the 400 pages, you'll power through this book in one day and then wonder why you even bothered. Boooooo! Hisssssss!"
3,good summer reading,"This book is the type of book you would bring with you on a vacation, or if you're going to be on a plane somewhere. I think readers can almost relate, and you find yourself rooting for Natalie.Buuuuut, it's not life-altering and it's a long book compared to most beach-reads. It's a good fun read."
3,not bad,"I enjoyed this book somewhat. I have not read any other Anna Maxted books, and from what I understand, the others are better than this one. I did find the main character a tad bit annoying with the fact that she did not know how to open her mouth. I did not find the eating disorder to be as irritating a plot as some other reviewers. I actually think it gave me a bit of insight into what someone with that problem may really go through. I think the story line could have been a bit better, but it wasn't bad. I would definitely like to read more of Ms. Maxted's work before making a final judgement."
2,...and twisting an ankle,"I loved the cover of this book enough to buy it, I'm sorry to say. And the first couple of chapters - read in the bookstore - were quite entertaining. This seemed to have all the Bridget-y elements: career girl with woeful man skills (but better, of course, than she thinks) and a slight pudge problem having entertaining social misadventures on the way to eventual Happy Ending. It's not a lot, but it's what I wanted.(*SPOILER ALERT,* if, technically, this sodden retread could be spoiled by me in the first place.)What I didn't want: Another damn anorexia story. That's what this is. I was duped - she only THINKS she's fat. Pardon me for sneering at a serious health issue, but come on - that's so predictable, so 80s! And the fun parts all dry up so we can suffer along with our tedious heroine. Bah."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"When I bought this book, I couldn't wait to read it! It sounded like it would be a fun, easy read, but I was TOTALLY wrong. I couldn't even get into at first. The characters were flat and there was no real, convincing relationship between them. The author went off on tangents that were totally irrevelant to the story and didn't make any sense. I started to get into the book by the middle, but instead of being the lighthearted, funny book I had hoped for, it turned out to be disturbing and depressing. The book was absolutely awful, talking about self-hatred and distorted body image. The synopsis on the back of the book was completely misleading. Don't waste your time or money on this horrible book."
3,Below expectations,"Having read Getting Over It, I couldn't wait to read another Anna Maxtet novel. Getting Over It was one of the funniest novels I have ever read -- however, Running In Heels is a disappointment. It lacks the wit and cleverness that her first effort had.Natalie has lost her best friend, Babs, to marriage. Who is going to be there for her for now on? Who is she going to complain about her mother and brother to? Who is she going to complain about her dull boyfriend to? Selfish Natalie whines her way into this book. Four-hundred pages of self-pity is not my idea of a pleasant read.Are you in the bargain for a droll and poignant read? Skip this one! Get Anna Maxtet's hilarious first effort, Getting Over It. Unlike Marian Keyes and Jane Green, Anna Maxtet's second effort does not show her growth as a writer."
5,Running in Heels....,"This book was a bit different from Getting Over It, a bit more serious, but still quirky. Although I found myself giggling instead of laughing out loud, I still thought it was quite good."
2,Good start,"I thought that this book started off well, but I, too, was blindsided by the fact that Natalie was fighting Anorexia. I felt like Maxted took too light of an approach to the battle that someone with Anorexia really has to fight."
4,couldn't put it down,"An enjoyable book of the ""trials and tribulations of a British singleton"" genre. For me the length was a selling point - I figured I'd bring it with me to school and read a little between classes during the week. But once I started reading it I couldn't put it down, and I stayed up late to finish it. The one disappointment for me was the price (as a poor college student all I can really afford is the library)."
4,It's a really fun book,"After readong a number of assigned reads, I wanted something a little lighter to get into. I saw a small book review in a magazine and saw this title recommended so I tried it. I can easily say that this book was very realistic. Nothing was too overdone or not true to everyday life. It started off as what seemed to be a humorous account of relationships gone bad for the main character Natalie, but the farther you get into the book bigger problems surface that deal with how Natalie views others and most importantly herself.This was a great read because it kept you smiling but also brought into the mind of someone who is dealing with very hard decisions. I would highly recommend this book!"
3,Exhausting,"I thought that Maxted did a fine job writing, but Natalie's neurotic personality completely tired me out. I had to put the book down several times in order just to give myself a break from Natalie and her whining and obsessing. If you know in advance what an emotional roller-coaster you are in store for, then the book is quite good. Just try to look for the strong points, like the humor, or the honesty(especially from Nat's friends), and then the book will be a lot more enjoyable."
2,Misguided,"Although I did find parts of this book funny, I found it to be horribly irritating; I wanted to slap Nat, and Babs, oh and yes, Franny, too... truth be told, I wanted to slap the whole crew. What I found most troubling was the cover leads the would-be-reader to believe it is about a young woman discovering herself after her best friend gets married. This is true, but what the book focuses more on is the characters severe eating disorder. If you've had an eating disorder you can probably relate, but is that why you bought the book? Probably not. If you haven't had a disorder, then Nat will most likely come across as spineless and annoying.I *really* wish I had read the reviews before spending money on this book."
5,I loved it!!!!,"I know this book has gotten a lot of bad reviews, but I personally loved it. this was the first book I have read of Anna Maxted's and went out and bought ""Getting over it"" immediately after finishing ""running in heels"". I finished the book in one day because I was so involved in it. I think it is the perfect summer read! I can't wait until her next book!"
4,"slow start, good body, fine finish","I feel that those reviewers who didn't like Natalie for being selfish have missed the point! I also found Natalie to be annoying and whiny and needy and everything that the negative reviews promise that she is. However, I thought that the book did a wonderful job of documenting the systematic breakdown of this woman's clean facade to expose the damage that she has done to her body and her mental health. The writing is rich and flavorful, and Maxted hits the female friend dynamic right on the money.My main criticisms are that the first part of the book drags and I thought that the romances were underdeveloped, although this could be a side effect of Natalie's emotional underdevelopment as anything (reviewer acknowledges that this is a stretch). This book would be a fun beach read, but it could also elicit some strong emotions from readers who have watched a friend succumb to anorexia."
2,What a Disappointment!,"When I saw that Anna Maxted had a new book on the shelves, I snatched it up in a nanosecond. The sleeve describes it as a 20 something trying to deal with her best friends' wedding, etc...and that it was witty and humourous. Perhaps I read the wrong novel. This was almost as depressing as In The Drink, but what made this worse was it was thinly disguised as another book in the Bridgett Jones genre. Truly depressing and much too long. The characters all seemed shallow and navel gazing. The alleged ""best friend"" Babs?? She & Natalie seem to despise each other. They more resemble two people forced to be friends because of their parents, rather than dear old friends. And Frannie?? She's already been done. Except Helen Fielding called her Rebecca. So not what I was expecting from this otherwise very talented author."
2,What?,"I won't repeat what others have said other than to comment on the flow (or lack thereof) in this novel. It was poorly planned out--at first it felt like a typical entertaining ""chick-lit"" book--but then suddenly I felt like I dove head-first into a very sick person's psyche. Lots of random thoughts and emotions with little or no explanation or context. Having said that, this book is not without insight, but someone rushed this book through--probably due to the first novel's success--without properly editing it first."
4,Intriguing,"I enjoyed this easy to read book. It is rather different from the typical romantic comedy book. The plot flows in so many different directions, but it does manage to keep you intrigued until the end. She truly loves her characters. I will definitely be giving her other books a try."
1,Horrible!,"Let me start off by saying I love silly fun girl books! This on the other hand was just horrible! It was literally excruciating to get through! This book was so repetitive, I was becoming frustrated trying to get through it, the characters were so bland. I cant fathom ever giving this more then 1 star."
4,Wickedly Delightful,"This book is an example of chick lit done correctly. Maxted does a fabulous job creating a main character who is completely zany, yet totally relatable. The book contained elements of surprise and at times I found myself laughing out loud. I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in an enjoyable and entertaining read."
2,Not good,"This book is not very good. I thought it would be different than it turned out. I really enjoyed ""Getting Over It"", but frankly, I'm sick of Bridget Jones' knockoffs, and the main character in ""Running"" is a pathetic one at best. Anna Maxed apparently thought that making insecure, ""silly"" Nataline anorexic (in addition to neurotic) would exceed her in character, but it just makes this novel all the more shallow and drab. You have to wonder the character of the author herself.....I got tired of reading it. Basically it was a big waste of money. It went into my recycle bin."
2,What???,"I picked up this book thinking it would be about the friendship between Babs and Natalie, and it started out that way. Then, all the sudden, out of nowhere comes the anorexia. The plot jumped around so much, i couldn't figure out what it was supposed to be. And Natalie's solution, pilates, seemed pretty farfetched. The book would've been a lot better if the author had picked a topic and stuck to it as opposed to exploring so many differnt things."
2,Not very good,"One of the worst chick-lit stories I've read in a while. Natalie, the main character, is incredibly messed up with food issues and anxiety about being left behind. You find yourself working through her issues with her and not understanding where she is coming from. It seems like she is developed in such a poor manner that you don't even understand what her deal is. I would not recommend anyone reading this."
2,Not as good as Ms. Maxted's novel Getting over it,"After reading the novel Getting over it, I was excited to find Running in Heels! I loved Anna Maxted's first novel and couldn't wait to read Running in Heels. Unfortunately, my expectations were very high. Although both novels were brilliantly written, the subject matter of Running in Heels is most distressing. A quarter of the the way through the book it's revealed that the main character is losing control and has become anorexic. From that point on there was much discussion of her disease by her friends and family & how she was chosing to deal with it (denial). I thought I was getting a light novel about a 20something trying to make it in the world, but I got a novel about an anorexic coping & there was no forewarning. It was sad not comical and I wish I hadn't started the book. I did finish it, only to find out if she would get well or not, but I wanted to warn others who might think this book is about an ordinary girl."
3,Cute and funny,"This was a fun book. I wouldn't say it was Pulitzer material, but it's OK and it was worth the discounted price I got on Amazon. I agree with the author about so many issues. Women are funny!"
2,running in place...,"I adored Maxted's first novel, and had great expectations for her second. After reading it, I am glad I didn't buy it. The story of Nat's eating disorder is not so much as even mentioned until about 100 pages into the book, which I found to be odd. Being that it is so vital to Natalie's character, it should have been mentioned alot sooner. The characters are somewhat likeable, even though at times I felt really frustrated with Natalie's spineless-ness, and felt like giving her a slap across the face. I didn't really find much humor in this book either. It could have been alot shorter if Maxted would have cut out all the unecessary self-analyzation by Natalie and pointless flashbacks. That is not to say I am no longer a fan of Maxted; I will still read her third novel. I swallowed up Getting Over It in about 2 days. However, with this book I found myself putting it down for days at a time. Take this one out from the library and save yourself the money."
3,Fun but could have been better,"This book was a fun, quick read but it seemed as if every plotline was d-r-a-g-g-e-d out a tad bit too long. Nat's disorder was introduced and then, pardon the pun, shoved down your throat. Her relationships, including her mom and brother, seem to come and go, come and go, come and go...and become very predictable and unrealistic. If this was edited just a bit tighter, it would have gained another star or 2. Sometimes you just wanted to shake Natalie... But it remains a fun, fast, Summer read, very entertaining. Just not as great as ""Getting over it."""
3,too overpriced for an album,"Although this album is undoubtedly one of the duo's most classic, it was wayyyyy overpriced and I regret having payed that much. Don't get me wrong, I understand these CDs aren't made anymore and for fans and collectors its almost impossible to obtain. This also is the CD that brought the duo to a higher level of fame. It put them on the map not just in the U.S. but in Spain and Latin America as well. So thats why my review is positive with some reservations and reflections on how high it was priced. then again, I was the one who accepted the price. come to think of it, maybe I should post some of my rare videos and CDs on Amazon too."
3,"OK, lid needs help","This is a 1L stainless kettle. While well built, I'm very surprised that MSR chose a design with a loose lid. There is no way to ensure that this kettle's lid won't fall off in use if the kettle is tilted. You will need to use the 'ol single-digit salute while pouring to make sure this doesn't happen. Also, you'll need to insulate your fingers if the kettle has been on the boil, otherwise you'll burn the beegeebees out of your hand due to no insulation on the handles."
5,odd reason to buy,"ok, i found one of these at a thrift store for 75 cents! lol, i bought it, packed it around a little and mae some tea in it (get a tea ball) then i decided to get one for my wife's Bug out Bag (we keep identical equip) i looked online and sure enough i found this which was the exact teapot, WOWEE is there a price difference...well, i got the first one so cheap so i guess it was a 2 for 1 deal, lol...great product, lightweight, easy to pack, holds my teaball and tea inside, all in all its a good one."
5,Experience shows,"Dr. Bare writes, not from theoretical, laboratory training, but from many years and thousands of hours of in-the-ring experience. Her matter-of-fact manual on preventing and curing martial arts injury is a must for any style of martial artist.--this from a 4th dan TKD instructor and nationally ranked referee."
5,Digital Version is Excellent,"This version for Kindle seems to be, by page 20 so far, without error. The German characters show correctly (such as ""Geräms""), and the ae combinations show correctly, too (like with ""sthetic""). The one star review on here seems to not be reviewing the digital copy. This is a great version."
5,Ryobi quality,"Great product, exact replacement from ryobi. My tuff sucker hand vac has double the suction now compared to my 5 year old clogged up filter. It's just a shame that The Home Depot(exclusive carrier of Ryobi) does not carry this product."
4,liquid,"Sunbrain's last record. Markedly different than previous. Less punk, more melodic. Aokay is a great way to end a record. Listened to a million times and made it into the jukebox at work."
3,A sociological study of the fighter community in Korea.,"A member of the U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Basic Reading List, ""Officers in Flight Suits"" is an interesting study of the fighter-interceptor and fighter-bomber community during the Korean War. John Sherwood is a military historian, but writes the book from the point of view of a sociologist. He compares and constrasts the backgrounds and careers of 12 fighter pilots who saw combat in Korea, including such famous figures as Risner. Sherwood's in-depth documentation throughout the book probably make it a valuable resource for those in academia. The book is also an easy and entertaining read. Not bad for a plane trip or sitting on the beach."
4,"Three, no FOUR cheers for Twilight Crossings","Speculative fiction, for years, has stood apart for various reason. This set of four novellas ie yet another reason why. ISADORA, TWIN STAR, EIDOLON, and THEIF OF DREAMS are all truly independant voices. Vivid imagery and world building take you to each world, and capitvate you for a short time.Well done ladies."
1,Steer Clear of this seller,"Awful, book was not nearly as good as described. It was completely marked up and in terrible condition. Amazon was wonderful and provided a refund."
5,I love the view of Mr. Drucker,"I have read almost all of Peter F. Drucker's books and articles.From this, I know what management is and what we should do at 21st century.Thank you! Mr. Drucker.:)"
5,Another Great Book,"Drucker is a master at Business management and a great visionary, this book is a must for anyone planning for the future--CraigAdams.net"
5,I have lern a lot of this book. I recomend it.,I`m a student of Business and I learn a lot in this book. It has a powerful comparation with the old paradigms of Business
4,"In my opinion, the best Peter Drucker book","Hands down 5 stars. An entrepreneur and business person must read. The best Peter Drucker book. Through his essays, Drucker is able to forecast the future. Tremendous insight into the ""Knowledge"" worker. Get this book now...."
5,Solidly built,I put this on my cord but haven't had an opportunity to actually try it out yet. It seems very solidly made and I don't expect any problems from it.
5,50 amp plug,this plug is well made and pretty beefy. I would ecommend this plug to anyone for purchase. you will not be disappointed.
4,Body For Life,"I have friends that used the book to become fit and strong for our line of work, I bought the book after seeing the results they acheived. I've only been following the plan for three weeks and I'm already seeing results and feeling great. The plan has been described as too physical for some, but if you can find that extra 45min per day to exersise you will never look back! The only thing that stopped me giving five stars is that the six small meals a day may interfere in a busy lifestyle though the protein shakes the book recomends are a big help, but expensive."
1,Just Like Any Other Fitness Book,"There's nothing here that you probably don't already know. Nothing that you couldn't find for free at your public library. Does the program work? If you follow it. However, isn't that true of just about any somewhat rational diet/exercise regimen? I lost 40 lbs. by simply reducing my portion sizes, walking daily, and working out with weights. I understand many of us want a cheerleader, a motivator, some ""expert"" to tell us what to do, when the hard part is just getting on with it, and doing something. Buy the book if you have little or no access to diet/exercise info."
2,This program is OK for loosing weight...,"If you want to loose weight, this program will help. However, if gaining muscle mass is your main concern, don't bother even trying this. The program does not allow you to eat enough in order to gain weight. By the way, the only way to actually gain weight is to eat a surplus of calories. EAS supplements do work, but so do many others that cost much less. Do yourself a favor, by Bill's magazine, Muscle Media AS WELL AS others and be your own judge. Find out what works best for you and stick to that. Don't be convinced that Bill Phillips is the only fitness expert around. Most of all, don't buy this book unless you have no knowledge at all of fitness or bodybuilding."
1,Can't judge a book by it's cover...,"You are right! You can't judge a book by its cover. If you judged this book by its cover it would be a five star book. When you dig a little deeper and acutally read the book without allowing the hype to get in the way, you will find its not all it claims to be. I wish you the best in your search for a better physique, I wish you the best in being able to avoid this hype."
2,Too complicated for me,I was looking for a good weight training book and found this one much too complicated and time consuming. Basically you do about six sets on each weight. The routine took over 45 minutes and wasn't very fun. Fortunately I have my own equipment. I can't imagine doing this at a health club with people waiting for the machines.
4,Hhhmm,The book is well written and easy to understand.The result pictures are impressive.the charts easy to figure out.But i have read alot of books like this.WE'll see if it works.I thought it was interesting that he also invented EAS products.
1,Body for Life: I Dont Think So,This book will not help someone who is looking to change their lifestyle for more than 12 weeks (If you can stick to the program that long). The manner in which the program expects you to eat is impossible for any normal person (unless you love nutitional shakes). The only thing that this book will give you is a hole in your wallet.
3,Too complicated to follow,"As mentioned in another review, the nutrition advice was lacking, to say the least. I found this book had very good advice on weight training, but to follow this program is difficult.. especially if you're going to do it for the rest of your life.I also find that as a woman, I need more cardio work. Although the pictures show successful women I'd be willing to bet it works better with a man's body.I'll stick with jogging - it works better for me"
2,disappointing,"Really nothing revolutionary about the book or the program. Basic workout routines and the non-revolutionary concept of eating a bunch of small meals a day rather that the traditional three.The disturbing thing I find about it is that this is really just a way to sell ""nutritional"" supplements.When I inquired as to participating in the Body For Life Challenge I found out that the one requirement was that you use Bill Phillip's Myoplex supplements in order to qualify. You don't even have to use the exercise eating program, you just *have* to use the supplements. That should tell you something. All the advertising, etc., that come with the book and the program are geared at you buying these products."
4,"I lost 21 pounds in 2 months...contact me, I'll help","I loved this book. It really inspired me to start getting serious. I have over 100 pounds to lose. I got serious with nutritional products on January 1st and lost 10 lbs. Got serious in Feb with these particular products and eating the Bill Phillips way and lost an additional 11 lbs in 5-6 weeks. Now, I can use some help getting to the gym. I am going to start the contest on Mar 18th. Write me and lets share info.On tract to lose 100 lbs, Deb"
5,Do Yourself a Favor.,"If you have been on every diet under the sun, do yourself a favor and purchase this book. You won't just read it once, you'll keep it close by for constant reference and inspiration. I also purchased the audio and find it well worth the money.This mans message is clear and concise and totally makes sense. There is no way you can follow this program and not lose weight and feel great.Proceeds from this book go to ""Make a Wish"", I was impressed with that. I also dontated $5.00 a pound for weight I lost on this program.For Life,"
5,Find YOUR reasons to finish!,"This book is more than just a workout book. I am not one to read ""motivational"" type books, but this is one area where I felt I needed to improve my life. Boy was I wrong in that thinking. The main thing I take away from this book is that if you set goals, and constantly try to achieve them, never settling, you will always be pleased with your life. I am on week 6 of my program, and I have lost most of my fat and have a much more defined physique, as noted by many friends! I quit smoking cigarettes after 10 years, and am doing my absolute best in school. Bill has showed me that you get back from life what you put in! The program is simple to follow, but it's much harder to be honest with yourself and ask, ""Am I doing 110%?"" Thank you Bill!"
5,"Get in shape for Summer with ""Body for Life""","I've been using Bill Phillips ""Body for Life"" for almost two years now.I've stopped taking the Supplements,but use the workout routines Bill shows you with pictures, and the foods he tells you to eat.You even get to cheat once a week,and eat like a pig.I've kept the 50 pounds that I lost off since that time,and never felt better.I've paid over 20bucks for ""Body for Life"" when it came out two years ago.You can get it now for under ten dollars.If anyone wants to know about my weight problems over the years,write,and I'll send you my web-site.I use to weigh over 350,but now I'm down to 195.I starved to death getting most of the weight off,and almost killed myself.This book tells you the right way to lose weight,and gain muscle."
4,A book for beginners,"Phillips, a great motivator, details EXACTLY what to do and how to shape a quality physique. Although the information about training and diet is elementary to experienced trainers, the goal setting and motivation techniques are very applicable. Mind set and motivation are the most important protocols in any endeavor, so it only makes sense they are the core of the program to go along with a precise diet/exercise strategy. Training and eating strategies in this book are easy to follow and are detailed in full. It would be hard NOT to get good results following this book to the word."
3,"Good for some, NOT FOR OTHERS (me!)","Don't get me wrong, Mr. Phillips knows his stuff (how to motivate those who do not live a healthy lifestyle, how to write in a way that is easy for the average reader to understand, and how to sell his supplements/magazine), but what if you are all ready in shape? I wanted to incorportate Mr. Phillips' advice and themes into my routine to give it a jumpstart. So I bought this book ... However, after applying BodyforLife into my own life, my physique actually declined! His theory on intensity simply did not increase my muscle or strength.This is a very educational book. It entails all of the BASIC fundementals of a healthy lifestyle. If you want to get into shape and discover that hidden 6 pack, this book will get you HEADED in the right direction. However, if you are an avid lifter and enjoy a healthy lifestyle, then I'm sorry pal, this book is not for you."
1,All Fluff! No Real Content,It is sad to see a such a useless book get so much hype and publicity. Do yourself a favor and take 10 minutes to skim the book in a book store and you will probably get as much out of the book as if you read every word.
3,Dumb and Dumber,"Most of this book is a bunch of boring long-winded story telling and the guts of the book could easily be condensed into 2 chapters, exercize and nutrition. This is definitely Borders reading - read it in the store but save your money for something more entertaining."
2,"If you want short-term loss, this program will work.","I've known several people who have done this program and when they follow it, they lose weight, they look good. But no one I know, including myself, has ever been able to stay on this program. And don't kid yourself, it's a program that involves intensive(though brief periods of)excersize. There is nothing wrong with excersize, I do it, I enjoy it and it's good for you. But realistically you have to eat right (good fats) to not have cravings and hunger, having cravings is a sure-fire way way to NOT follow a diet. I would not recommend this to anyone simply because it's not a program people stick with. This author is also a big promoter of ""his"" weight-loss and protein products, which are expensive and can be bought in other forms much cheaply. I'd pass and go with a diet program that promotes healthy fats, low carb and low protein. It's the only way I've ever been able to lose weight, keep it off, feel good and have success sticking to."
1,Think about it.........,"If the simple diet and exercise program outlined in this book produced the results shown in the infamous before/after photos after only 12 weeks, this plan would have been discovered and followed religiously years ago! Everyone is different and it is just a matter of finding what works for you. I followed the program outlined, including the supplements and did nothing more than gain weight! As soon as I dropped the supplements, went back to a sensible diet and increased aerobics, the muscle came and the fat is coming off (slowly but sensibly). Don't let the unrealistic results promised here discourage you!"
1,don't buy from here,"Excellent product, but you can buy it from abbottstore dot com for $9.99. I couldn't find it on the EAS website and searching on the interent didn't help. Stumbled over it while looking for something else."
4,I got results,"Pretty good fitness plan - first one I ever tried. I was definitely leaner at the end of the program and in the best shape I've ever been in. Completed my physical fitness test (Air Force) with my highest score ever so I was very pleased with the results. The book was annoying to try and read - the first several chapters made me feel like I was watching an infomercial but once you get past that they make good points and explain why they have you do certain things a specific way. I have an enormous sweet tooth and yet I was able to complete the program - the ""free Sundays"" really helped.They push their own diet products in the book too, but if you shop around you can find some comparable products that do just as well.I highly recommend the program!"
5,Motivational,Body For life is becomeing a classic for anyone starting out trying to get rid of the fat and get into great shape. Recommended for anyone who doesn't know the basics and needs help. The diet section throughout the book is good basic information while discussing supplements(note author's product line) but any good protein or meal repleacement will work. Overall very good.
4,Just Bought the Book,"I read all of the reviews here and there are strong camps for and against, no one seems to be in the middle on this one. I've read about the first third so far and it seems pretty good to me.I am currently 36 years old, male, 5' 9"" and 215lbs. I am going to start the program and see how I do.I, like many, have never gotten great direction in a gym, and this book seems to have a very specific plan.What the heck, eating right and exercising can't hurt, it can only help. So I'll check back in atr the end of the year and let you know if I'm RIPPED!"
2,Somewhat helpful but disappointing,As a big fan of Bill Phillips and EAS I am unhappy to report that I was disappointed with this book. Most of the material is simply reprints of articles he has printed in his MUSCLE MEDIA magazine. For beginning bodybuilders who are experiencing Bill & his priciples for the first time this book may be useful. For anyone with a basic understanding of exercise this book provides nothing they don't already know.
2,Tell me something I don't know!!,"Don't let 304 pages fool you, it is really 114 pages of BIG print, and the rest are questions and pictures of exercises. Save your money and have a friend or member of family tell you to exercise or lose weight, you just need someone else to motivate you. I give it 2 stars for those of you who do not have people to motivate you. I think I could have written a better book. It is one big pep talk."
4,Note to the BeanPole,"Try the Phosphagen HP in place of the Myoplex. To me it seems as if you don't intake enough carbs. Just a thought.As far as the book goes: Good motivation, sound principles, although you can substitute Myoplex with another workout supplement that is cheaper and just as effective. No, I don't think this book is an ad for EAS, although it does mention Myoplex. But for a college student like me, it is just too expensive. Other than that, good book."
3,The book was OK.,"I purchased this book on a recommendation from a friend. I thought it was ""OK"" and have to admit that it was motivational. For that reason I give it three stars. I also agree with many that it is a marketing ploy... The web URL is plastered across the bottom of EVERY page for crying out loud! Who goes into business with the intention of NOT making money.. I'll admit I'm jealous because he is making money and I'm not."
3,Looked to build stamina for golf.,"I looked at this book as a way to get me in shape to improve my golf game. It did help and with information I also got from a new book, Nutritional Leverage for Great Golf, I am looking forward to a good regime over the winter and improving my score for next season."
1,Why only one star?,"First off let me say that Bill Phillips is running a business. Of course he is in it for profit. He should profit from his work and he does quite well from MuscleMedia, EAS, NeoElite, USR, etc. I'm happy to see him donate book profits to charity, good for him. Now why do I give his book one star? This book is too much of an advertisement for his products. I felt like I bought a book telling me how my life will change with Amway. Maybe my life will change if I get involved with Amway but I don't want to read a book about it. Second, Bill's program does not contain any new information. Basically the book is a rehash of Bill's magazine and other fitness books. Third, Bill's tone is a bit much. Bill strokes his ego more than the average bear.This book is a one star book to counter all those 5 star reviews. If the positive reviews were honest they would give this book three stars, as it deserves."
1,A load of BS!!!,"What is so different about this book and ANY magazine you buy at the good ol' corner store. Muscle Media includes basically the same material month after month just in different wording,(Can't come up with the words this month EH.)As does his book!!! How many times do we have to be told that working out can make us feel great, and that it takes great disclipine to become what we want!!!"
4,Highly effective and keeps you on track,"I started working on this program 2 months back, and have seen results that exceeded my goals. The great thing about this program (and the book) is that it provides you with data sheets that you can use, and keep track of your progress. The other interesting fact is the way Bill recommends doing your exercises...starting with a level 5, and going all the way upto 10... I have been going to the gym for 3 years now, and have not seen any other technique work so well...I believe that this technique would work well for ppl. of all sizes and shapes, and that if you are sincere for 3 months, you will (guaranteed) see results.I entered 4 stars coz' most, if not all, the information in the book is on Bill's website and you really dont need the book. Additionally, you can download the fact sheets etc. also for the website. It's nice to keep the book, but is not really required."
2,Body for Life,"I am pleased with the purchase, timely shipping and service. After several uses the book came unbound in places. I got such a discount on the book that I could not be dissappointed. I am happy with the whole process. Thanks for asking."
2,im starving on this regime!,"there is no big secret to the success here. consume less calories and burn more. i felt faint the whole time i was doing this program. i was starving! and my god, a can of tuna fish with non fat mayo? i'd rather eat cardboard. unfortunatley, this diet leaves you feeling hungry and weak with the only thing to look forward to being your next ""meal"" of a ""portion"" of pasta the size of your fist with a little lemon juice on top mmmm!mmmm!"
2,Overhyped,"I've seen my wife bring home various exercise and fitness books - this is just one more of the same. One of the strengths touted of this book is the support group behind it. When we tried to use that support group, we received no response. The book can be summed up easily: Lift weights, do aerobics, and eat lots of protein. Now you know, save yourself some dough."
2,mostly a waste of time,don't buy this book...it is a waste of time and paper...everything in it is common sense and could be said in a few words: eat healthy small portions and exercise daily and drink lots of water...it was not motivating at all.
1,A total waste of money and shelf space,"I purchased this book thinking that it would provide a guided program for working out and body building. The author wrote much about the concepts and the theories but failed to provide the promised program. He kept encouraging the reader to start the program which he promising to talk about later in the book, but he never got to talking about it. I flipped the pages back and fourth and found no concrete program to follow. Concepts and promises of providing the program later is all you get. If you know that muscles are good for you and can be built by working out three times a week for twenty minutes and doing aerobics in between, you already know most of what this book has to offer. If not, you know it by now!"
2,The diet depends on supplements and is not for vegetarians.,"I read many of the reviews before I purchased the book but have decided to return the book because you do need the supplements to make the diet work. I'd say having 3 shakes a day for 12 weeks is a big part of the program! Also, this is not a diet for vegetarians."
3,Great way to start - needs modifications,"For 2 entire years I lived by the priniples of this book. It is easy to read and understand. I have only one problem with it: The author assumes that every individual is the same. Don't get me wrong, I got decent results applying these principles. Though we all have the same muscles (men & women) and need to work them similarly (depending upon the results you wish) not all of us get the results which I take to mean that not all of us should be on EXACTLY the same program. I recommend Tom Venuto's e-book ""Burn the Fat, Build the Muscle"" in addition to BFL."
1,"Good fitness advice for beginners, bad nutrition advice","While Bill Phillips has put together a very basic fitness program that will be effective for beginners, he is also providing dubious nutrition advice. OVER consumption of protein is not necessary to build a great body (look at Arnold) and can lead to serious health problems (osteoporosis, heart disease, etc). He also advocates the use of highly processed supplements (his own or others) containing numerous chemicals such as aspartame (an invitation to cancer). If you want a great body AND great long-term health, follow a natural whole foods diet. With the money you'll save from buying supplements and other processed foods buy a gym membership and/or the services of a personal trainer."
4,Simple enough to be used for life,"This book's strategy does work. I like it because I have loosely used its guidelines for over ten years, being stricter when I need to and creating my own rendition on a day to day basis. The diet is not painfully difficult which makes it very do-able. The truth of the matter is, fitness is something that absolutely is ""for life"". It should never stop, just goes up and down in terms of intensity. And if you steady the course, you'll find you can take time off without losing too much. Body for life."
4,Good book,"This book is a great starter. It contains many helpful exercises, foods, and advice. I used this program over a year ago and lost close to 40lbs. I am now using it again to try and lose another 20lbs. I would suggest starting this with a buddy to help keep you accountable."
3,Neither all bad nor perfect,"The workout and diet plan outlined in this book works, period, no doubts about that. Anybody who says otherwise is either whining about the effort it takes, or wanting to acheive a steriod look. Sure there are other methods that work, but you gotta pick one and stick to it. Might as well try Bill's way, given that its worked for so many people.The fact that he pushes his products is neither here nor there, everybody's trying to sell something.The worst thing about this book is the *writing*. Its sentimental, simple, and the man uses the phrase ""You see,"" *constantly* which truly drove me up the wall. But the content is good, and that's what counts when you're reading for information, not entertainment."
4,This program WILL work,"Even looking at the poor reviews for this book one thing is certain, if you eat right and excercise properly you will loose fat and gain muscle. The best part of this book however is how it makes the entire process VERY easy to follow. You don't worry about calories at all. You follow the basic guidlines and you will loose weight.For all of the na sayers who claim this pushes supplements I say read the book again. The suppliments are not necessary as Bill Phillips mentions. If you have the time and desire to cook 6 meals a day, do it...if not, get a supplement.You can't loose with this book....I am living proof and the only reason I bought the book is because a friend of mine had such amazing results with it."
4,An effective begninning,"Phillips' book is for those of us who've been down the frustrating road of ineffective diet after ineffective diet, with no success. He attempts to simplify the lifestyle needed for overall fitness, so that anyone can do it. That is the greatest strength of the book, because it allows for the greatest number of people to achieve their fitness goals. Unfortunately, he believes in the use of diet supplements, which is a chemical rather than a lifestyle change. This is contradictory to the book's central view, which is the advocation of a fitness program that is flexible enough to provide you with good health for the rest of your life. That part of it has worked for me so far, and I hope it works for you too."
5,"A thorough, step by step and simple to understand program.","This book was the best I have ever read on fitness. The main theme is attitude, where Phillips is second to none. It offers many specific how-to's on how to transform your body, regardless of past failures or disappointments. As far as his critics, they must be his competition, because I love the magazine, and the book was even better. And, by the way, the Myoplex is much better than any other protein shake, hands down!"
2,OK for beginners to Weight Training & Bodybuilding,"Having read a recent exerpt from ""Body for Life"" in Bill Phillip's Musclemedia magazine, I thought the book would get into a lot more detail than the article. I found the beginning to be nothing more than testimonials from individuals and couples who all said the program changed their lives-inspirational yes, but I can get that from Bill's magazines & his ads for his supplements. I was looking for more of a direct approach (""here's how to do this, why it works the way it does, and how it applies to you""). Instead, I feel I read a slightly longer excerpt from his magazine with really no added information. For someone who needs advice on weight training or bodybuilding, and who has really never done research before, this book may be a good find."
2,Republished Magazine Articles,"Body for Life is a compilation of author Bill Phillips' magazine MuscleMedia. About 75% of the book was already published in the magazine at one time and I would be willing to bet the other 25% will appear within the next 6 months. The workout itself is very good. I have tried it before, because it was in the magazine about 2 months ago, and if done correctly does produce results. The diet section leaves a lot to be desired. All in all, I feel it is a below average book that can be read by looking at the last two issues of MuscleMedia."
4,Great fitness book,"As a United States Marine, I am extremely interested in fitness. I read this book to see if I could get any tips to improve my workouts and health. I learned a lot of great exercises, truthfully more than I expected. This will certainly help to add variety to my daily workout plan. I would recommend this to anyone, from the beginner(who's still a little nervous at the gym) to the workout pro."
5,One of the Greatest Guides to Fitness!,This book is really easy to understand. It gives you the knowledge and skills to transform your body into a fit body. We've read it again and again.
2,Did not meet expectations.,"I was truly disapointed by Bill Phillips' book. I was expecting some new revelation that would motivate me to work out. It did not move me at all. I thought some of the stories were good but the training methods were stuff you could find anywhere. I take the EAS products and they are fantastic. Overall, this book was a quick read and not worth the price. Get it in your local library for the stories."
3,It's ok but....,"I really got into this book, I think it's 1/2 useful book, it does say some great things that we all should know by now.The one thing that sort of got me was this 'healthy' lifestyle he talks about does not corispond to me with the fact that he goes on to sell his personal 'shakes'.I LOVE his workout program, yet has lot's of limiting factors to it. like the time of day you can work out, and what equipment you should and should not use.FOod plan was fairly good and he did make it 'easy' to eat things.I think he goes into a faboulous mental aspect of losing weight and is very motivational.I was extremely turned off by the suplimintaion he was 'pushing' in his book. I got the impression this book was suppose to be 'different', even his web pages goes to pages with some questionable products.I would recommend anyone checking this book out for some basic ideas and adding it to your collection, but don't think this is the 'last' book you ever read on ths subject."
1,This book has NOTHING to do with being healthy!!,"If you want to get healthy, this is not the book for you. If you want to fill your body with chemicals -- then this is the program you've been waiting for! This book was a waste of money and the program is a waste of time. I did not feel healthy on this program at all. I had headaches from all the chemicals that I had to ingest using EAS supplements. Yes, I lost fat and gained muscle -- but it is done in an unnatural way. I now choose to eat right and exercise regularly in a natural way that will last for life. This is just a fad.......and a way for Bill Philips to make millions!!"
3,overrated unless you are out of shape!,"Granted, Mr. Phillips knows what he is talking about and knows how to market his products. However, if you are an avid lifter, this book is not for you. I personally have lost about 20% of my lean body mass by implementing his program into my daily schedule. Again, if you want motivation, need basic knowledge, and a good beginning program, this book is for you. However, if you consider yourself to be a hard-gainer with already a pretty good build, you could regress as I did."
1,"Look into my eyes, you are getting very....","hypnotized. This book does nothing more nor different than a sermon, a sales pitch, or a smooth-talking pick-up artist does -- and that is regurgitate information we already know and help us to make up our own minds. This book's content is much more than a regime for the ""perfect"" body, it is an oasis in a desert of desperation and lies in the same realm as does such successful motivational pyramid-building schemes. If the saying that ""the body follows the mind"" is anything true, than do yourself a favor and find alternative ways to lead the life you want to live."
2,Get to the point,"I bought both the book and the tape, thinking I could reinforce the text by following along on the CD. They don't track very well.Also, I am into the second track on the second CD, and still not into the program yet. As I've flipped through the book, I find his ideas not too different from others I've read. Perhaps that's to be expected. Fitness generally comes from a basic set of regimines. But I'm thinking much of the material in both the CD and the book focuses a lot on personal back patting on the author's part, rather than getting to the point of the presentation. One of his points is to minimize the time spent with the diet and exercise, yet the book will take several hours to read and the program only is dealt with late in the presentations."
2,Motivating testimonials but lacks content and depth,"This book has lots of testimonials which are great if you need motivation. However, the content, I thought, was shallow and elementary(what was with all the sappy stories?). Also, the small ""healthy"" eating chapter (and it was just that a ""small"" chapter) was elementary and boring. Basically it told you to take supplements to make up for the nutrients you aren't getting from the foods he tells you to eat. They consist of veggies and lean meats. Although his information is simple, I was not at all impressed and learned nothing that I didn't already know. I would not recommend purchasing this book-just use common sense."
5,Changed my body and my life,"I was skeptical about this book, but 10 weeks ago I felt chubby and out of shape. My roommate and I bought this book and this plan works. I did not start out overweight, but I had no muscle tone to speak of. I've been on the program for 10 weeks, lost 15 pounds and have never looked better. My roommate went from a size 10 to a size 6 in 10 weeks. I think this book is extremely easy to read and to follow. The plan doesn't take a superhero to finish. I've got two weeks left on the plan, but I'm not going to stop. The results are just too good. I would highly recommend this book for those who want to get in shape and start eating healthy. It will be the best money you ever spend for your body."
3,Good book for great price.,"I purchased this hoping to get more nutritional education out of it. It has very limited info on the nutritional aspect; was disappointed in that. If you are seeking the fitness aspect, this is defintitely a good one! Takes you step by step and is easy to follow."
4,Great stuff!,"Bill's done a great job. This book has some excellent recommendations for getting in great shape in a serious, but safe way. His suggestions are very real world, and achievable. Great read!.James RayBuild Your Dream Body (Volume 1)"
3,Big motivator BUT too much focus on supps.,"This book is a huge motivator for many people, even the free video Bill sends out is a good motivator. But do you really need supplements to look good? Is it considered ""healthy""? He doesn't directly push you to use EAS supps, but the hint is there that they are the ""best."" Instead of spending tons of money on supps, invest it else where. Supps only work if you keep using em. Another off the hand comment. Ever since this fitness challange came out bill's MM magazine has SUFFERED! What a waste of money. Use to be an awsome magazine."
1,Not as described,The product was described as a Hardcover copy of Body Of Life. Instead I got a CD of an interview Of Bill Phillips. No wonder that the price was so good. I am very disappointed and do not plan to order from Amazon again.
5,Unbelievable!,"I was the last person in the world to change my eating habits. I loved food so much, it would make me angry to think of ""going healthy.""However, after reading this book, following the workouts and meal plans, I have discovered a new person. I WANT to be healthy, I WANT to workout....I WANT to be better!This program is not a fad diet that you just go on to lose weight. It is a life-changing experience. I have been following it for 7 months and I plan on staying with it until I die.For those who didn't like this book, I have a feeling they were looking for some quick-fix diet.....not a long-term, life-changing experience. Those are the lazy ones.If you want to change your life forever, if you want to be the happiest you've ever been with your body, if you want to feel healthy for once and for all.......READ THIS BOOK."
5,"Folksy Style, but a Powerful Message and Technique",This is the one self-help / fitness book that really hit home for me. I was able to follow Mr. Phillips program over 12 weeks and lose 25 pounds. In the process I felt much better physically and mentally. I have been able to keep the weight off (mostly) and I intend to start another 12-week program to continue my weight loss. The book contains very sensible and easy-to-follow advice. It obviously worked for me. I've been recommending the book to friends and family ever since.
2,"Not bad, but consider a wider spectrum of books","I find Body for Life a phase in our quest for body beautiful, and rather superficial in terms focusing only the physical. Beyond that, the spiritual and mental focus needs to be tackled with other possibilities. ""The Art of Happiness"" by HH Dalai Lama, ""Tuesdays with Morrie"", or the Asian book ""This Body This Life"", are some examples. I find This Body This Life inspirational because the co-authors are born with physical and medical conditions, and with little going for them, conquered their limitations to be healthy and happy. Quirky, down to earth, honest, and very useful!"
1,Complete Rip-off...,"Really Bill, so the safest and most healthy way to lose weight is to eat Myoplex/EAS energy bars? The moment I opened this book, I felt a con-job in the works, especially after watching a supplementary promo-video in which Bill and his brother hawk bodybuilding tips in Vegas.Why does the author assume that the reader will equate being strong with being healthy?The only thing that consistently keeps the pounds off for good is simply to burn more calories than one takes in. An easy way to do this is to get a good half-hour aerobic workout in daily, along with eating a relatively balanced diet, free of excesive snacking and sweets. Sensible always trumps sensational in the long run, even if it leaves profiteers such as Philips out in the cold.Don't waste your money."
1,Complete Fraud !,"This book seems so amazing, until you start reading the whole program. Bill Phillips RECOMMENDS using the Myoplex supplement, but it's a nutritional supplement that costs a lot of money. Anyone could achieve the same results with another training program using a similar nutritional supplement."
5,Here's how well it worked for me......,Simply put....$60/month in Myoplex Bars & $30/month Gym MembershipFollowed the program (mostly)4 months = 72lbs gone & It helped me to quit smokingI can walk/run again without joint pain....Good sound advice....a little cliche at times and maybe even self-promoting....but hey....it's still real world advice that works....I even made it through the Holidays and only gained 5lbs.....that should be gone within the 2nd week I'm back on the program....What's $20 and 40 hrs over the next twelve weeks compared to the habits that can carry you in health to a ripe old age?
5,You will lose weight!!!!,"This book and system works. I lost a total of 45lbs. over the initial 12 weeks. After almost 3 years (at the end of March) I'm still working out 4- 6 times a week and eating 6 meals a day. If you want to get in shape and want to do it the right way, this is for you. Also, you don't have to buy anything from EAS. I use a few different types of bars and proteins to get those quick meals on the go that are so tough some times.Good luck!"
4,Pump You Up?,"The answer is yes. This is a well-written book with practical advice. We all see the most fashionable diet and health trends on the bookstore shelves, but we also all know in our hearts that the only way to be healthy is to make the necessary lifestyle changes. It does require work, but it also doesn't have to be difficult.Bill Phillips plan is practical, and requires a only a reasonable amount of work from you. You'll work hard, and you'll sweat, but you won't spend hours at the gym, and you definitely won't starve. I recommend this simply due to the fact that it's easy to do, and easy to understand. Your own common sense will confirm this for you if you choose to read and implemnent the Body for Life plan."
3,Things you should know,"Well, I give props to Bill for being something of a fitness guru. He has managed to get himself into shape and inspire others to follow his lead. However, my beef stems from the misleading suggestion that his book offers any advice that differs from that which can be found for free on his web site. After dishing out [the money]...I expected to become privy to information not so readily available on the net. Once again I was mistaken.Now that is not to say anger pulses through my veins at this point. This review is a word to the wise. Follow the man's advice. Just follow it for free from his web site."
2,Body for Life: 12 Weeks to Mental and Physical Strength,"ONLY FOR THE MOST DISCIPLINED! If you have the time to document everything you eat and all the exercise you do along with the discipline to plan out six very concise meals a day, then this program is for you. Body For Life is a very difficult way for the average person to live. Bill puts forward a very structured program that must be followed to the letter or it does not work. As a mother of 3 little kids, I guarantee you that this program will only work for those of you who have alot of time in your day to dedicate to fitness. In the beginning it sounds like an easy way to lose weight but it's not."
5,This book is a powerful tool....,"You just have to use it! Thank you Bill for helping me get a better ( no Much Better ) Life. I attempted the 12 week challenge a couple of years ago and didn't finish. This time with the help of this book I will not only finish but do it with style. I also appreciate the fact the Bill is giving his proceeds from this book to the Make A Wish Foundation. I applaud this unselfish act and admire him for it. Thank you again Bill, Brad"
3,Only good for beginner,"This book covers everything a beginner needs to know. It provides lot of information about simple effective exercises and a little complicated ""milk shake"" diet. But if you are a ""Muscle Media"" magazine subscribers like me , you will find all the information in the book come from the magazine. Also, if you already know body building or weight training. You won't find the book useful."
5,Great Program!!,Great Program!! I found body for life to be a great program. but the only down side is tracking your meals and workouts. I found a great program for palm pda's at...and if your on Body for Life then you should try the programs out. I coult not do Bodyf for Life without them
5,The Program Works,"The bottom line is the program works and when you follow it for just 2 or 3 weeks you will see for yourself. The fat drops off of your body and you will get stronger. It is not an easy workout by any means as long as you follow the rules, BUT it works."
3,Good but don't overlook its real purpose,"It is more of a promo for a nutritional supplement company, which (once you contact them) will send you endless ads for their products."
5,The best thing that's ever happened to me!,"This book is terrific!!! I've personally completed the challenge three times and have gotten everything out of it that I put into it. And for everyone who gets all up tight about his ""pushing"" his products, does it make any sense that he would push the GNC brand? Come on, if you're afraid to really put your money where your mouth is, just say so! Hey, because of this book I ran a 1/2 marathon yesterday--something I wouldn't have been able to do a year ago, also something I would have never dreamed I'd even be able to accomplish. I have the t-shirt to prove it! If you want to be healthy in mind, spirit, and body, this book is for you. It's the total package, not a quick-fix. I'm living proof!"
1,Nothing useful that you couldn't learn yourself,"Bill Phillips is at it again. With his Sports Supplement Review the founder and owner of supplement company EAS disguised a marketing piece as a semi-informative discussion of nutrition as it relates to bodybuilding. This book is yet another attempt by Phillips to sell his overpriced and generally ineffective supplements. His writing motivates some people to better themselves. Me, I can't get past his smarmy, self-congratulatory attitude. ""Shawn, warm up the private jet!?"" Please."
4,Well worth the time for beginner or fitness veteran,"As usual, Phillips has created something of value in the fitness and bodybuilding realm. I have yet to find a publication or supplement product produced by Bill that does live up to its claims. If you've been working out for years without noticeable changes or have decided to finally get in shape, invest some time in this book, ""muscle media"" magazine and the EAS.COM website...you'll be glad you did."
3,Motivational,"This book is for people that need a push, it is especially designed for people that are just beginning to get into shape and/or struggling to get the perfect shape. The book is very very easy to read and doesn't have any mumbo jumbo hard to comprehend words. I did not agree with some aspects such as not eating before working out and also the fact that you have to work out more than one body part per session."
2,Nothing new to share.,"Bill Phillips has made himself into a guru of strength training for the average american. He has also been able to market his company's products by doing so. I found nothing in the book very helpful. The exercises are not unique and I have a difficult time agreeeing with his suggestion that aerobics being done only three times a week for 20 minutes. While the book may be helpful to those who have no idea of weight training or couldn't previously find the gym,the book will be a big disappointment to those familiar with weight training looking for a way to improve.I do have to give it to Phillips: it appears he has a cult following and has made himself rich doing so, but not offering anything different than others."
3,"Good book for beginners, could use less marketing of EAS","A good book for beginners. If you subscribe to his magazine, save your money and stay with the subscription, however if you want a good workout routine with words of wisdom, this is a decent book. Would liked to have seen more than what magazine already shows though."
5,More Than Just Another Fitness Book,"When I first heard of Bill Phillips I thought it would be just another BS fitness craze. Yet,after 12 weeks (Starting in january 1999) I had lost 25 pounds, got rock hard abs, went from a 35 waist to a 29 or 30, and I got a new lease on life. I now enjoy buying new clothes (something I had always feared before), and every day when I wake up I love seeing the results. I no longer fear taking my shirt off at the beach, actually it's quite cool to be able to show off a bit! If your tired of failure, and if you need someone to give you the hard facts about bodybuilding and life building then listen to Bill, he won't stear you wrong! This book is one great cornerstone to build a new and much better outlook on life upon."
5,Two Weeks and Counting,"I bought this book in December 1999, right after having a cervical disketomy where they replaced two ruptured discs in my neck with a bone graft from my hip. I told myself, that as soon as I felt up to working out, I would start this program.Three weeks after my surgery, I started working out and eating better using the guidelines in the Body for Life book. After two weeks on the program, I have lost 8 lbs. and am feeling great!Now, mind you... I have to work out with a neck brace on and have had to work around my injury as not to damage the work that the doctor did in December. But to date, I have had no problems... So, if I can do it, even with a neck brace on, then anyone can do it. I recommend this book for ANYONE, even persons with disabilities or obstacles to overcome!This book has the guidelines for anyone to successfully start a healthier lifestyle."
4,Because anyone Can Do IT .,"I started this program about 9 weeks ago, I have lost about 30 pounds . Have not used one EAS product only good food hard work and sincere DETERMINATION . I feel the best I have ever felt In my Life .ANY ONE CAN DO IT !"
1,I'm sorry I wasted time on this book...complete garbage!,"Kudos to all those EAS employees for their loyalty. You guys wrote some plausible reviews, were it not for this annoying little thing called content of the book. Body for Life is absolute garbage. Where should I start: the poor writing, the specious looking before and after pictures or the thinly veiled marketing tone of the book? Anyway, I hope Bill and his legion of devotees one day channel all this effort and cultish devotion towards more spiritual (and therefore more rewarding) pursuits. Exercise in moderation is great. Squandering your wealth on high carb muscle food is stupid. But thanks to Body for Life, the toast of Golden, CO can be a Millionaire for Life."
1,I didn't like it at all,"I'm not really anti Bill Phillips like some other reviewers and I don't know his history. I bought this book, followed the technique to a key and felt worse after. I have a feeling it was the supplements because I never had such headaches just from working out, and I've been working out for years. Somethings I did find annoying like the ""late night infomercial"" tone through most of the book and each page had the e-commerce website on it six times. I will give credit to Mr. Phillips ability to motivate people but I'm not convinced Anthony Robbins won't do a better job for you."
3,Too hard to follow,"Many people have had great results with Body for Life and it is a good program. I couldn't stick to it, I tried seven times. It is not for everyone. I was constantly hungry, injured myself, and binged on my free day. I hated the shakes and got frustrated. I thought it was me and I was a lazy person. Then I realized it wasn't for me and did something else. I cleaned up my diet, did some exercise and lost 200 pounds! It is a good book but not for everyone."
3,A little unrealistic?,"I would like to see more attention paid to weight loss and muscle development by authors who aren't trying to sell protein powders and other supplements. I've read the book and find some of the recommendations to be a little bit hard to swallow. I don't know about anyone else, but I don't have the money to spend on over-priced protein shakes nor do I have the time to eat six meals a day. I also find it hard to believe that anyone could achieve the kinds of results in twelve weeks (without the use of steroids) that the people on the inside cover managed to get."
2,Good book.. except for one crucial fault,"I found this book as basic, and hence, good as I had imagined based on the former Phillips' stuff.But there is one crucial error in this Phillips' life style. Although the whole Body-for-LIFE is supposed to be centered on healthy life and healthy body it is still promoting the (excess) use of aspartame in one's diet, which we all know isn't healthy. Personally I have been waiting Bill to somehow react and answer to the people wanting more information on this subject, because no one's going to buy that 'it's all safe' talk, which I'm sure he's not even going to start with.So before EAS finds another way to sweeten their products I suggest that you stick to a healthier diet but apply the other good advice the book is offering."
1,Although the book is $17.50 the program is $500 per month!,"Please check the EAS website BEFORE you place your order. Bill Phillips' program is $500 per month in supplements (that works out to $6,000 per year).Bill Phillips is to fitness what Anthony Robbins is to motivation, Tom Vu is to real estate, Jay Kordich is to juice and that sweater guy is to car wax. There may be a good idea in there somewhere but I will cost you a boat-load of money to get to it. You are better off with a different program, a different supplement line and a different book."
1,Don't pay too much for this...,"Don't pay too much for this DVD set. You can get it directly from EAS for less than $10. It has great info, but not for the price these people are trying to sell it for."
4,"Great, but basic advice","The advice in this book was good, but not very detailed. I was looking for a fitness book to really get specific, this did not. But it covered so many topics well, that i still think it's a great book... Thanks"
3,Good But Could Be Better!,"The concept is great and if followed it does work. This is justme personally but in order to follow this to the letter I have to get up at 430am in order to complete all reps of the exercises and at 430am I am not awake enough to count the repsand sets, I keep forgetting where I am at. I have been trying to determine an easier way of counting and still get the same physical results just maybe not as quickly. It is a good program just not time-wise feasable for me to follow."
2,Very little information on the tape.,"Wow, this either is a really poor book or the tape is so abridged all the details were lost. The first tape is basically about making todo lists. Yes, that may help, but really old news to most of us.The second tape (yes, only two of them) get's into the diet, but again so little detail. Eat 6 meals a day, meat the size of your palm and starch the size of your fist. Way too many examples of foods that match that size, ""A potato is natural's single serving package"" he said. I was getting worried as I listened to all the meat and starch combinations (the only detail on the tape), then he finally did talk about veggies.There's basically no information about the activities you should do, just more talk about the times you should commit.Granted this is a tape, but I was sure expecting more from such a hyped book."
3,Fails to cover stuff,"While the book did help me out nicely with my workouts, he failed to help the little man. I am not short according to other people (I come in at around 6'1"") but I find myself short. I come in at about 175 lbs. When I started working out using BFL, I came in at 150. Other than my shoulders and abs I have noticed no change in my physical appearance in comparison to the ones in the photos. I have gotten much stronger, but have not gotten bigger. Because of my metabolism, my body will not bulk up. I am very skinny, yet in some exercises I can match other people at the gym who are 2 or 3 times my size. All I got from this book was toning. He never talked about how a smaller person could get muscular using his method. I used his method and got stronger, just not bigger."
1,very disappointed!!,"I was very disappointed, it made it seem by getting this book, sure you would have to cut down on certain foods, diet, exercise, etc, but never did I expect to have to either join a gym, or go out and spend money on a home gym..I thought for a change, I would find a book, that I could follow like ADKINS and work out at home, by doing simple exercises without spending ALOT OF MONEY on equipment!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK, UNLESS you want to spend more money on a gym!!!"
5,It worked for me and my Mother!!,This is the finest book on building a heathly lifestyle ever. I was an overweight child and in my adult years I was getting in worse and worse shape. I went on this program and now I have a 31 inch waist and a 44 inch chest. It also made me look so young that on my 35th birthday I had to produce an ID to buy beer at the grocery store. It has made my whole life MUCH MORE enjoyable. God bless Bill Phillips! My Mother is on the program and she is getting fantastic results.To the trainers that are writing negative things about the book... I'll bet you anything that I am in better shape than you are!Buy this book!!
1,"A ""Fitness Revival Meeting"" instead of a concrete plan","Unless you enjoy endless self promotion and sophmoric hype (saying ""body for life"" when doing reps), stay away from the cassette. There is nothing here but testimonials and hype. I couldn't believe that for this price, there were only general references to a concrete exercise plan....you have to buy the book to get that. A complete disappointment!"
5,Very informative and inspirational.,"If you're looking for inspiration and tips on nutrition and fitness and willing to take the plunge then Body for Life by Bill Phillips is the book for you. This book is filled with an impressive collection of inspirational `Before & After' photos and stories about people who have lost weight, reshaped their bodies and changed their lives. After reading the stories and looking at the photos you're all pumped and ready to read more. Phillips explains to the reader what carbohydrates, proteins and fats are by making it easy to understand. There's tons of information in this book just waiting to be read. In the back, there are also tons of different exercises for each body part.Everyone will be able to benefit from Body for Life, regardless of fitness level. It's definitely a must read!"
2,One big advertisement,"This book is okay but nothing special. I was expecting much better from Phillips. The information is this book is very similar to what is in MuscleMedia so it is probably better to just buy that magazine. I can't really recommend that you buy MuscleMedia but the magazine is very, very similar to this book. I was hoping that new information and insight would be included but this is the same information in new packaging. I can sum up the book in a few words ""Buy my supplements and work out"". Is that amazing? I truely don't understand why the reviews here have been so positive. I would sum up the book as lukewarm and nothing to get excited about. Reading the positive reviews here I'm reminded of those all too excited participants in infomercials."
1,I thought I was going to learn how to reshape my life,"I thought this book would help me change my life. Instead it almost conviced me to go and spend hundreds on EAS products. Bill, next time spend more time on the working out part and less time writing about your company."
1,You will lose weight but don't expect miracles,"I spent 16 weeks in the program. Yes, I lost weight, but even taking the shakes, excersing 6 days a week and controlling my meals -yes, 6 a day- I don't look (by any means) as the folks in the book. Honestly, after eating as explained in the book and excersing so much, the least I expected was looking slim. But by following the program I didn't get the results offered in the book. Bottom line: if you want just to lose weight, you don't need to buy this book. And if you expect to look really good...well, buy something else or get a trainer."
1,"Been there, done that","Waste of time, waste of money. This is basic body building repackaged with a high protein diet. I still have a pamphlet from the 1970s by Joe Weider that espouses exactly the same thing that is being said here at a fraction of the cost and without the contest hoopla (what a 90s thing! sheesh).No doubt about it, if you follow this plan, you'll loose weight and buff up. But how many people are actually going to stick to this? Yeah, yeah, I got suckered into buying this book cause everybody everywhere is talking about it. But being a veteran of the diet wars (anyone remember the grapefruit diet the first time around?), I should have known better.There are NO magic bullets and NO magic cures. Losing weight is tough, hard work. This author isn't saying anything you haven't heard before: eat less and exercise. It's just got a very slick package going for it. Your money can be better spent on a new pair of walking shoes."
3,Could be distilled to 20-30 pages,"The book could be shortened dramatically if the motivational fluff was excluded. But without the fluff, who could get excited?Simplistic, non-scientifice, but still compelling.I'll start exercising tomorrow."
1,"All Fluff, Little Substance","Complete waste of money. The workout routines were good, but the substance of the book could have fit on less than 10 pages. The book's website has all the useful info you will need, so save your money on this one. Not recommended even a little."
5,I have a BS in Health Science.,"I have a BS in Health Science and was curious to read this book to see if it was quacky. Pretty much everything in the book is true to what my professors in health, nutrition, and physiology explained. I didn't have any classes on weight training, but my spouse is an athlete and agreed with the methods Bill Phillips recommends. It sounds like a good program if you're really ready for a lifestyle change. Go for it!"
2,"Good motivation, lacking some specifics","He could be a bit more detailed on the foods, I know he's trying to make it easy but I think anybody who has issues with food and portion control needs to be counting calories. I also have his cookbook and I must say the recipes in there are delicious."
1,An Expensive EAS Ad,Myoplex is loaded with aspartame and most people I have trained have stomach problems in a very short period of time; often immediately. There are some very good products on the market that are priced fairly. Every serious body builder knows EAS products do not fit into this category.
1,Simply another infomercial for EAS,"Good ol' Bill. I tell you what, if you want advice from BP, don't get bodybuilding/fitness advice, but instead business advice. This guy can really write ads and suck you in. But each and every time I bite, I am profoundly disappointed. His books, articles, etc. are nothing more than a big advertisement to buy some more EAS product. 'Body for Life'...it touts buying his Myoplex and using it at least 3 times a day as a diet breakthrough. Do the math on what that would cost you. Don't fall for his ploys again my friends!"
4,Do you want it?,"It's really simple. This program works. No hype, no fluff, no excuses. Based on solid, proven principles & research. Do what these people did and you will get similiar results. I spent most of my life ashamed & embarassed over my body. Now, I can't believe my reflection in the mirror. But, more importantly, I realize that this guided me towards the ""inside-out"" which is truly life-altering. Detailed, thorough instructions and a slew of on-line support - you can't beat it."
5,Excellent - Back To Basics,"I've been a runner/gym exerciser for many years. Seems like I gained 2 or 3 pounds a year working my way up to maybe 20 pounds overweight. I bought the book for motivation and got more than I paid for. In my 10th week and have lost 15 pounds of fat and gained at least 5 pounds of muscle. The incredible thing was I had to cut back on my normal workouts. It's all about basics - dump all junk food, eat good proteins for re-building, rest muscle groups after workouts, allow yourself a total rest/eat what you want day. I know I'm doing better than some of the 5 day per week gym rats.I wish I had the book 20 years ago."
1,Too bad!,"Don't be fooled by Bill Philips. If you wanna get a EAS catalogue, you can ask it for free on the EAS homepage. The book contains very simple routines and a lot of biassed advices about nutrition. The guy even advices you to take three servings of Myoplex a day...He should write a book about marketing or business, not about fitness. If you are serious about getting fit, learn how eat right instead of spending hundreds of dollars every month on supplements as he advices."
2,Time consuming,"This book is great for motivation. Having a ""free day"" is also great. However, the program involves too much time. Preparing six nutritious meals per day and exercising six days per week, is something that could not fit into my schedule long term. I was completely burnt out by the end of the fourth week. I felt restricted by the foods (probably because I am a picky eater)and I found his recipes to be bland and boring. He advocates the use of supplements in the form of shakes and food bars, instead of one or two of the six meals. However, when I went to the website, I thought the supplements were outrageously priced. So I tried the program without them, and found it very difficult to maintain long term.I have a busy life. I was constantly staying up late to prepare extra meals for the next day and getting up earlier in the morning to fit the exercise into my schedule. This program requires a lot of free time despite what the author says."
5,Great Book For All Training Levels,"This book is great no matter what your level of training is - from beginner to advanced people who are looking for a change. The best thing about the book for beginners is the set program in easy to understand language. There aren't any scientific measurements needed in the food recommendations. He does mention several of his products, but admits any products or just regular food will work. The book also has inspirational stories. I think you will find that the programs are easy to follow and will get you results. My wife is now working out due to this book, and I'm buying it for my mother for Christmas."
2,Body for Life,"Book was listed as used but ""like new"". Upon arrival, it was full of highlighting and underlining throughout the book. The book also contained some personal pieces of paper from previous owner. This is very distracting and certainly misleading, as it is not LIKE NEW! Very disappointed in this merchandise."
4,Body for Life,The book arrived in great shape. It did however take a little longer than usual. Maybe because there was a holiday during the time.
1,Not for someone who has to bag his or her lunch.,"This diet is almost impossible to follow.I work outdoors in construction,you have to eat six times a day.Difficult to follow if you work in the field.Maybe if you work in an office or at home."
2,There's one born every minute.....,"If you like gimmicky fluff, this book is for you. The reviews only confirm just how gullible and ignorant many people are (I especially liked the one by the woman who said that her fat was converted to muscle while following the program -- which, if true, is the biological equivalent of being able to walk on water. Sigh!"
3,A bit long winded,"I was a bit disappointed with the content of this book. I was looking for a personal trainer in a book and instead found someone repeating himself for half the book on the mental part of getting in shape. I have the motivation, now I want the technique. Bill Phillips spends most of the book just trying to motivate you, but doesn't give enougth detail on technique and how to set up a program personalized to each individual. There are no references on the best number of reps, how fast or slow you should lift the weights, how to individualize a program and what machine/exercises are best for each individual (especially differences between men and women). I have found another book that focuses on women only to be more beneficial to meet my specific needs and help plan with my individual schedules and body. Bill is too much hype and not enougth muscle."
1,"Should be titled, ""My Products for Life.""","Old Bill has done it again! He's managed to repackage the same information he's been dishing out in his magazine for the last few years, but in a longer, more expensive, hardcover version."
2,This book needs work,"I thought Bill's ideas were well organized but the overall principles are nothing new. This book does not have any scientific breakthroughs people. The average fitness enthusiast already knows over 75% of the information presented. Take my advice, wait to read it off a friend or borrow it at your local library in a few months."
1,beginners will love this book--everyone else--don't buy!!!,"Philips book deserves 1 star mainly because its filled up with way too much insprational bull--as is Muscle Media magazine these days. His program is extremely basic and , while good for beginners, is close to nothing for experianced lifters. In mymind this book is basically a catalog/promotion for that physique transformation thing of his--god knows how many times he tells us to use Myoplex (don't even get me started on ""HMB feels like Deca"")."
2,Found it ok,"I had bought four books in all, two about abs and back and one was 'The Abs diet'. This one said similar things as many other books said. The couple of things that I learned from it were running early morning empty stomach and the workout routine that is suggested. Besides just some stuff for motivation etc. which I was not looking for."
4,A fitness guide perfect for everyone,"Who could ever question the validity of anything Bill Phillips writes. This book is an excellent collection of exercises, methods, and principles that can help even the most novice fitness enthusiast lose pounds of body fat and tone up the muscles.Bill teaches, quickly and efficiently, the principles behind building an excellent strength training routine, including effective exercises for every muscle group that can be performed at a gym or in a home gym.The crown jewel of this book is the dieting structure Bill outlines. He gives tips on how to build a fat burning, metabolizing diet that one can adhere to for a lifetime.Excellent book, Bill; a classic.-Craig Nybo, author of [ ... ]"
5,"Love the book, easy to read, and very motivational!!!","I read the book completely and read over different parts several times to be sure I'm doing everything correctly. I started the program this past Monday(927). So far I love it and seems almost too good to be true. Being a mother of 2, sometimes find it hard to eat right. With this program you really never get hungry so therefore, my cravings aren't there and my mind stays focused. I'm very excited to see my results in 12 weeks, I just hope they are as dramatic as the ones in the book. My determination is incredible!!! My only concern is that I'm not using the Myoplex stuff. I just hope that doesn't play too huge of a role in the program!!!"
4,Builds Mental and Physical Strength. Requires Financial Strength.,"Great information. Written well. Very good logical help for getting fit, but requires home gym or gym membership. He also recommends that you buy his products for best results, which can get a little pricey. Overall much better than most fitness concepts. Recommend it."
2,The cassette is NOT the real deal.,"I bought the audio cassette version of the Body For Life program. The tape is a good motivational tool, but it lacks in instruction in a major way. It is not a complete fitness program, but instead, a teaser to get you to buy the book. I will be returning it for a refund, which EAS has been gracious about. I will say that I'll check out the book at the library, and if it is as good in instruction as I have heard, I'll buy it."
5,Judge for YOURSELF...,"I read all the reviews and ordered this book to find out for myself, after reading the entire book the day I received it, I can tell you NOT to pay attention to the negative reviewsThose that say this is nothing more then an EAS ad haven't truely read it, EAS and Bill's product aren't even mentioned until halfway thru the book. Why? Because they are part of the program HE created. You can use alternative supplements, if you choose. Just go to GNC and ask for similar products. But this is a program promoted by EAS, so of course EAS products are recommended. But it is hardly a glorified ad for EAS, it has useful info.It's a great start for beginners, like me, and it IS worth it if you want to change. As for the 20 minute aerobics, if you follow what he says it is an INTENSE 20 minutes. ACTUALLY READ and comprehend what is said before you write something negative about it."
5,Should be required reading for anyone deploying a TS Solution,"This is an excellent book written by one of the leaders of the field. Brian Madden's Terminal Services for Microsoft Windows Server 2003 should be required reading for anyone involved in deploying or maintaining a Windows 2003 Terminal Server infrastructure.While there are a lot of Citrix books on the market that go into great detail on deploying thin-client based solutions with that product, I find the general quality on MS Terminal Server (w/out the Citrix layer) somewhat lacking. This book goes into great depth on configuring and deploying solutions based exclusively on Windows Terminal Server. Madden also includes coverage of some standard IT-related topics which are not exclusively related to Terminal Services but any practitioner will encounter while deploying a TS based solution - such as login scripts and printing.I highly recommend this bookRegards,Meredith Shaebanyan"
3,Nice for introducing,"Nice job for introduce to advanced functions and options on LDAP.Not imprescindible for experienced users, but perfet structure, nice design and a perfectly description of all functions and advanced options."
4,Deserves credit,"This book is all about design thinking; from marketing and communication strategy to aesthetics, it brings lots of good concepts that, aligned with good practices, should change the way you look at ""how things look""."
1,Too simplistic to be worth your time.,"Shallow, trite attempt to make basic practices into a new marketing ""concept"". Might have made a decent magazine article, but there's not enough ""meat"" here for a whole book."
5,Most Brilliant Thing EVER!,"If you wrap this around a tree the right way - you won't have to worry about damaging bark. Even though I always forget how I did it last time - I am always able to wrap it around and pop the metal toggle through the loop at the end (shortening up the line through the toggle) so that I can hang my hammock, knot free, securely and easily when I am backpacking or camping. Never mess with knots again - this thing is brilliant!"
5,Excellent Reference Book for the Organizational Manager,"Excellent. Well written, excellent ideas with firm experience behind each chapter. Very good book for classroom or busy professionals who need that extra edge."
5,:),i have been wanting this book forever its super funny. It arrived in great condition just like new! im so exited to finish reading this !
2,"Rude in 1935, Still Rude in 2005","I have a large collection of etiquette books from the 30's, 40's and 50's, so I thought this one would be a good addition. Well, I was wrong. It's ""okay""- but certainly isn't ""nice,"" nor does it offer any ""good"" behavior. Maybe it's me, but I found the whole sarcastic thing to be rude, not witty, not clever, and not very funny. What's called ""razor-sharp lessons in female one-up-manship"" sounds more like plain old mean. I suppose that's what they're calling ""classic satire,"" though I'd much prefer to get my classic satire in the form of Moliere or Heller or Orwell-- or even Monty Python.That said, this 1935 book is touted as being ""as timely and amusing as ever"" -- maybe so... the more things change, the more things stay the same. Mean is nothing new, and not always fun or funny."
1,How to write a bad history,"Having read the book several times I am shocked that the author was ever taken seriously by a publishing house. John Laffin's book is bad history. Nowhere does he constrast the problems facing the French at Verdun with and the British on the Somme. Laffin does not have a basic understanding of the military situation in 1916. In fact, its important to point out that John Laffin does not have a history degree. He is by trade a tour guide who is making money by jumping on the band wagon about Haig. I'm sure with a title like Butchers and Bunglers it will sell well, but lets fact it, its not history, just historical fiction like Blackadder. If you fancy a laugh and want a book that shows you how not to write history, buy this one - its a scream"
1,Woefully Misleading,"Stop and think about the fact that the Allies/British actually WON the Great War. By 1917/18 the British army was the only army that had not had major mutinies and was fully capable of offensive action. The British army suffered considerably lower casualty rates than either the French or the Germans and the rate of tactical and technological innovation over the period was nothing short of incredible.For a sensible analysis of the facts on casualties see Gordon Corrigan - Mud, Blood and Poppycock. For an analysis of innovation during the war see Paddy Griffiths - Battle Tactics of the Western Front: The British Army's Art of Attack, 1916-18 ."
5,Great Learning Toy!,My son is 4 1/2 and absolutely loves this. It is great for learning letters and numbers. It is very durable. It has even been thrown a few times and still works. I would definitely recommend this toy!
4,Lost,My daughter loved this toy. We played with it in the car frequently and typically took it where ever we went. The problem is the place to store the letter cards is not secure. I think we now only have two or three cards left. We like the toy but would love to see a design improvement that has a locking storage space for the cards.
4,Search for Maginetics instead,"The doodle board concept is a great item for kids. It's appeal will last for years. We've used it from toddler age for scribbling and putting together lines and circles to elementary school with phonics, spelling, math, and how to write cursive letters.But I would suggest the Maginetics doodle board over the magna doodles. The Maginetics Doodle Writer (on the Canada Babies R Us site, but not here) seems to be holding up better. And best of all you can erase a small spot, you're not locked into using the sliding eraser bar."
3,Not that Educational...,"I thought this would be great for my 2-year-old. It would teach him letters and eventually be able to draw the letters. Then he received it for Christmas...It has a cute concept, but I was so frustrated with the educational aspect of the toy. There's a feature on it that ask you to draw the letter then push the button. It doesn't matter if you draw the letter right or even at all. It gives a ""hooray"" either way. That's not educational. How are the kid's going to know if they're doing it wrong aside from us telling them so.If you're buying it for the educational aspect, I'd say save your money."
4,Good toy,"My son loves school busses, so I thought he would love this.It is good quality, but he isn't interested in the cards that come along with it, he just wants to draw, and there isn't any place for the pen on this one."
5,Good Place to buy,"I have used this brand before, but had to drive about 100 miles to get it. Being able to order it on Amazon and have it delivered, on time, to my door is GREAT! I will continue to buy here. Good Job!"
5,very good information on the glycemic-index.,I read and began following the suggestions in this book early December 2012. I have lost two inches off my waist.
5,The New Sugar Busters,Just plain great. Bought this again to give as gifts. Has helped friends and family members achieve weight loss and a healthy lifestyle. An easy to follow and stick with plan that works in an easy to understand format. Thank you.
4,Clear and concise,This book explains the science of weight loss in a clear and concise manner for the lay person to understand.
1,Sugarbusters,Lots of talk about how and why but very little direction about the process and what to do. Not at all helpful.
4,GOOD LEARNING TOOLS FOR DIABETICS,THIS BOOK WAS VERY HELPFUL IN DISCOVERING SUGAR AND WHAT YOU CAN AND CANT DO TO REGULATE YOUR INTAKE PORTIONS. VERY HELPFUL FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS DIAGNOSED AS A NEW DIABETIC.
2,Very unrealistic,"This is a great idea and I think they are right we do eat too much sugar, but the advise given is pretty dramatic. I think it would be very hard to follow, just be cause of how our society and food is made and manufactured. I think it would be better to have people try to cut their sugar or be more aware of it on labels and try to cut back. They suggest to sugar which would be almost impossible."
2,too basic,"The three MD's who authored Sugar Busters have discovered that sugar is bad, but haven't learned about all the other horrendous things that have happened to the American food supply.Sugar contributes to disease, they say, sugar makes us gain weight and we should avoid it. So far so good. But turning to the meal plan we find a bewildering array of processed and denatured foods: High-glycemic whole grain extruded cereals like Whole Grain Oat Cheerios and Shredded Wheat `N Bran; reduced fat triscuits; lowfat milk products; lite mayonnaise; and MSG-laden Worcestershire sauce, Kitchen Bouquet browning sauce and canned chicken broth.Reduce saturated fats, they advise, but fail to mention the problems of trans fatty acids.Diet drinks containing neurotoxic aspartame are fine, according to the writers.This book is a good example of that old saying: A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.From Sally Fallon at westonaprice.org."
3,Couldn't Get Through It.,This book has a lot of good information in it however it seems like there TOO much. It's written more for doctors or other people with similar backgrounds - lots of technical terms. My husband and I tried doing the diet they recommend but we lasted about 2 weeks. We're vegetarians and were hungry all the time (We aren't usually. Its just that we couldn't eat a lot of starches anymore and other foods.). It just wasn't for us. The explanations (what I understood from them) made a lot of sense. I wish we could've followed it but we couldn't.
2,Only so so...,"This book didnt grab my attention. I am an adult who can admit I need a lot to stimulate my motivational button. This book has a lot of recipes and helpful information (so I have heard) Sorry to say though, that for me.. this book was just blah. When it comes to a recipe (because I do love food) it take a visual stimulation to motivate me. I like to see pictures and colors. I want to see what the dish looks like. The book is all black ink. No pictures of recipes prepared. So just on that note I have to say I just didnt dig this book. On a good note.. I have cut out surgar and carbs for health reasons.. and in just doing that, the weight loss becomes an added bonus. But this book didnt do much for me."
3,how sugar inhibits weight loss,"Many people say ""never eat anything white"" and this book shows you why refined sugar is not beneficial to human bodies and how they are supposed to work."
3,Repetitive - but informative,"The Sugar Busters book was not only a rehash of the book before, it was a rehash of itself - if you actually take the time to read it straight through, you'll notice that half the content is the same material repeated over and over. And the print IS obnoxiously large.However, if you are picking up Sugar Busters for the first time, this book is a great way to get the basic facts about the low-glycemic, right carbohydrate format of this diet, in a little more detail than the previous edition. The charts, recipes, and label information makes it easy to get started, and the lists of ""acceptable"" foods makes it easy to stick with it. The book is written in a simplistic, gimmicky format, but the diet makes sense - and it works."
3,A Serious Topic,"This is my first time reading a book by this author. The title really caught my attention. You will go through a lot of emotions with this book. If you're looking for a feel good story, this is not it. There is a positive ending however."
4,dvd's with case fit snugly into this,"i would have given it 5 stars but the envelope is a bit tight for my purpose, mailing new DVD's. a standard DVD with case will JUST fit in the envelope with a packing slip. if your DVD is a bit larger you will rip the seams out of this, i know this as a fact. first class mail with this is $1.11"
2,smaller than other bubble packs,"The price is good and the delivery was OK... but these bubble packs are smaller than other ""0"" packs and it is difficult to put in a DVD case without tearing the package."
1,"Random pictures with guitar music, thats it....","I rented this movie thinking that it would provide some insight into Varanasi, one of India's holy cities. Unfortunately all this video amounts to is what appears to be random scenes and clips of people the city and the river, to a background of guitar (not even indian) music. There is no introduction, no narrative and the viewer is left to guess about what is being shown, what is taking place there and the possible significance.

5,Directed Electronics outdoor antenna,Bought this to hook to Sirius tuner that hooks to my Receiver. Works great and I did not install outdoors installed in my attic near eves of roof works with out interuption or interference. I just followed guide for directional placement for my part of country (NY) and all is well.
4,Always great quality I wish all of sirius was.,This is a great antenna that is made for sirius radio. I forgot to review this item & I have internet radio now & love it plus I can still tape a ton of sirius shows on dar fm & listen when I want. I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE HIGH PRICED RADIOS OR PAY A HIGH MONTHLY FEE OR HAVE HARD TO HANG ANTENNAS. Plus I get pandora & a lot of other things from local stations. Go for grace internet radio. The radio is as cheap & no monthly fee. Plus I get Howard.!! BABA BOOEY.
4,A More Sirius Antenna,"This antenna improved reception indoors and out. The small antenna included with the radio and boom box lost the signal easily due to trees- there are a lot here and more out camping. Although not perfect, it is a great improvement over the standard antenna."
5,antenna,we had tried the indoor antenna provided with the sirus receiver and experienced dropped signals regularly.we have had no problem since we installed this antenna.well worth it.lance h.
5,WOW - What a Difference !!!,"Bought this for my new home stereo receiver that has Sirius on it. This item has worked perfectly. I have had NO signal loss at all. My wife and I each have Sirius plug & plays in our cars as well as the boombox. You always seem to lose your signal from time to time with the antenna that is included with the boombox (mostly during indoor use). So i decided to go with this outdoor antenna for the new receiver and I'm glad I did. Installion was simple. I attached it with the included hardware to my satellite dish and ran cable antenna (with extension kit) to my Sirius Connect Tuner.My set up is as follows: ""Sirius Home Outdoor Antenna"" connected to ""Sirius Single Cable Antenna Extension Kit"" which is connected to ""Sirius SCH1 Connect Tuner"" which in turn is connected to home stereo receiver.I have been very happy with all my products made by Directed Electronics and would recommend all."
1,Don't buy this antennae !,"After working fine for 2 months my sirius radio suddenly started displaying ""no antennae detected"" meaning the antennae wasn't working any more. Sirius customer service told me the problem is with the antennae itself which I believe. I called the manufacturer, ""Directed Electronics"",and was told that they no longer manufacture this antennae for Sirius since January and had no more in stock. How does a piece of plastic and a coaxial cable just decide to stop working? Because it wasn't made well to begin with. Don't Buy It!"
5,GREAT!!!,"Wish I had purchased this a lot sooner!! I now get 100% uninterrupted listening, unlike with the antenna that came with my boombox which often lost signal while in the house."
4,Affordable K&N replacement air filter,This product appealed to me because the cost was just a little be more than buying a one-time use paper filter which I was thinking about buying to use in transition while I was waiting for my K&N reusable filter to dry. Now I could use both and alternate. I've driven 8k with them and it works fine.
2,"Good fileter at good price, but not fit 2009 Infiniti FX35","I like the price and the filter itself; However, Amazon has the wrong size listed for the 2009 Infiniti FX35. This filter is about 2 inches taller in heights, but width is ok. There is same filter with 2 inches less in height."
2,IMHO AMAZON lied to me regarding this product,"Simply put this filter clearly states that it will fit a Nissan Murano. If one Nissan Murano can hoestly tell me this filter fits they are wrong. This filter is well over 1/4"" too high and will never set properly compared to an OEM. It, in a word, is worthless. FRAM WHY DO YOU LIE TOFRAM PPA4309 Air Hog Panel FilterPEOPLE."
2,Book falls short of Demaret's stature,"Demaret was one of the most vivacious, colorful, beloved characters in the history of golf. I expected the book to be as much. Instead, it rambles here and there, with too few quotes and stories and too much history of secondary characters in Demaret's life. All in all, it fell short of my expectations. It lacked wit, humor and a behind-the-scenes account of Demaret's life.If you want a step-by-step history of his life, this book is it. The author does his homework with the stats and facts. Unfortunately, the wit and life falls short."
5,INSTANT CLASSICS. SHE ABSOLUTELY KNOCKS ME OUT!,"A friend turned me on to this singer and I tell you she absolutely knocks me out. In every way. Her singing touches my heart. ""Serenade In Blue"" and ""Louisa"" are both so hauntingly beautiful they should become instant classics - and all that romance followed by a swingin' ""Now, Baby, Or Never"", followed by an electrifying ""Kicker"" (with her own vocalese to boot), capped off by Brazilian and Mexican ballads - makes me want to bow down in awe. To me she is one of the 2 or 3 best singers out there.Joan Bennet"
4,"Good quality, flexible leads","I have a couple sets of these, one for a bench power supply and another for a bench meter. I use them all the time, and coil the leads out of the way when I'm not using them. I appreciate the flexibility of the wires when coiling them. The clips are good. I've occasionally gotten them stuck when clipping down into a hole in a thicker item (like a screw hole on a terminal strip when I'm too lazy to find a fitting screw!), and they don't clip well to larger cylindrical items (like the screw when I'm not too lazy...). Then I should just use an alligator clip and clip these to that. Hmm.."
5,This One Grew On Me Quick!,You might ask why I had to have it grow on me before I liked it. Well quite simply because I was expecting Views Of The Future or I'll Stand Up. His style was different and more advanced. He had definately grew a bit by this time and it really paid off. Pat comes back after this with CD with Moonlight Dance which is one of his best.
4,10 years before his time,"I just finish this book and was amazed on the many similarities to our present day situations. First he predicts a terrorist attack on American soil, remember this book was written in 1999. Although this may seem predictable, there are many more story lines that aren't. Not wanting to ruin the intricate story I implore you to read yet another of Leon Uris's masterpieces, and see how he has written our future."
2,what a disappointment,"I've loved just about everything else Uris wrote, but not this one . . . almost did not finish it! . . . the premise of the story was a good one, but there were long passages that were almost painful to read . . . I'm glad I was able to skim through them quickly . . . don't waste your time."
2,Disjointed and disappointing,"I would expect better from the author of Exodus, Battle Cry, QB VII, and Trinity, but unfortunately The Haj should probably have given me a clue as to what I could expect from this latest attempt. It seems that Mr. Uris, in all of his recent works, does a fine job of building his characters and in describing them, but then gets bored with them and the work at hand. The last thirty pages take the steam out of all of his hard work to get you to be involved with the story, and he completely explodes disappointment upon his readers. I guess I'm done reading any new works by Mr. Uris."
1,"If you miss the Uris of old, read Kleier","I feel betrayed! RUINS is itself a ruin; a hollow derelect of former Uris masterpieces. If you thirst for a book to match the power of EXODUS or TRINITY, I have found such a novel in Glenn Kleier's compelling suspense thriller, THE LAST DAY. It will move you like the Uris we used to know and love until, hopefully, Leon finds his voice again."
2,Disappointing,"This latest book by Leon Uris is very much a disappointment. When I saw a new book by Uris I was expecting the same powerful work as Exodus, Mila 18, QB VII, and Trinity, yet this book falls very short. Many errors. Poorly edited. Who ever wrote this has no clue about Colorado baseball (no baseball team) or Lubbock, TX. Are we sure Leon Uris wrote this??"
2,"Leon, where are you ?","It is sad to see the author of such superb contemporary classics spinning his wheels in this, and his last several books. I used to RUN to the store and buy the hardcover at full price, when the word was out that Uris had written again. No more. This book will be available in the $2.00 stack at Media Play in about 6 months. No disrespect to the author, but, maybe it's time to just move on to something else."
2,"Interesting premise, uneven plot, disappointing conclusion","When you read the jacket description of this book, KANE AND ABEL by Jeffrey Archer immediately springs to mind. If only A GOD IN RUINS lived up to the quality of Archer's seminal work. Unfortunately, the promising summary gives way to an uneven book that ends feebly. Uris leaves astonishingly large gaps in the narrative, weaves in and out of first person for much of the first half of the book, and ultimately ends the story very weakly. For a writer of his talent, the novel is uneven and disappointing."
3,Very disappointed by poor editing.,"I love Leon Uris. I've read all his books and several have had specific influences on my life. Therefore, I was very excited when I learned of A God in Ruins and I preordered immediately. I am only 86 pages in but was compelled to do this review to register my shock at the poor editing job done by Harper Collins. Snyder and Camp never played for the Brooklyn Dodgers, Snider and Campy (Campanella) did. Columbia Law School has no basketball team. No grad schools do. Columbia University (undergraduate) issues no athletic scholarships. The most egregious error, however, is that the list of the authors previous works is inaccurate. Uris never wrote a book entitled Milta Pass. He did, in fact, write a fine book years ago, Mitla Pass. How sad. Heads should roll. I'm almost afraid to read on to see what other errors mar this work."
1,"Say you didn't right this, Mr. Uris.","...I checked this audiotape out at the library. But I do a lot of purchasing here and I also rely heavily on Amazon.com customer reviews in making my book purchasing choices. Unfortunately, somehow I didn't consult them when selecting Ruins. Man I sure should have. After listening to Ruins, I honestly felt betrayed. I haven't anything new to add that hasn't already been covered in the other reviews. I would like to offer a challenge though. I challenge anyone to find a book from an author as great as Leon Uris that is as bad as this one. I grew up on Leon Uris. He is the reason I became a historical fiction devotee. For that I will forgive him (maybe not his editor), and I can only hope we will see a return to the writing standard of his previous works."
1,Did Leon Uris Really Write This ??,"Halfway through this book I finally got fed up. I came to this site on-line to read the reviews to see if I was the only one who couldn't believe Leon Uris wrote this book.I loved Leon Uris' earier books, in part because I thought I was learning something. But now I have this question: If he wrote such over-the -top tripe about the American scene, was he equally inaccurate about the other cultures dipicted in his earier works."
1,Saving Slick Willy,"I've been an admirer of Uris from the time I read Battle Cry while I was in the Marines. This latest book is a far cry from Battle Cry. I'm about half-way through and just got to the part where he begins praising the ""slickster"" and doing a job on the NRA -- and I mean a one-sided trashing of the organization. All Democrats are good and all Republicans are bad. Leon, my erstwhile friend, you've lost me. Your mind has opened up so much that your brain has fallen out. I'll finish this one, for the purpose of discipline only, then you and I are through. Wish I'd have read the reviews before spending my money on the hardcover version."
1,TAKE IT OFF THE SHELVES - LET HIM SAVE SOME FACE,"I also thought that maybe my tastes had become more sophisticated since reading Exodus and Mr. Uris's other works, which I loved. I'm relieved to see I'm not alone in thinking that this book is really bad. The writing is especially poor. The publishers should really take it off the shelves and let us remember Leon Uris for Exodus, Trinity and his other fine works."
2,Disappointing,"I can't believe that the same author who wrote THE HAJ AND MILA 18 wrote this book. It is scattered and sophomoric and I'm most disappointed. Perhaps he was ""getting on"" in years or health and just needed the money."
1,Dreadful,"I just stopped reading it ... I tried, I really did, I wanted to know what was going on, what would happen with the characters, but the writing is just so awful. I find myself constantly stumbling over sentences, having to go back to parse through them slowly to see if I can figure out what he's getting at. Sometimes I get it ... other times I'm still left wondering what they hell he's trying to say.I read Uris in the past, and enjoyed his work. But this is just dreadful, and to be quite honest I was left wondering if perhaps he wasn't getting a little senile by the time he got to this book ... the writing is just so obtuse, so strangely structured, that there seemed to be something seriously wrong with the writer. Either, as some other reviewers have suggested, a ghost writer wrote the book, or Leon Uris was in serious decline by the time he wrote this. Either way, the publisher should have fixed it."
1,Undeserving of Leon Uris,"I have read a number of Mr. Uris's books, including Exodus, Trinity, Mila 18, Topaz, and The Haj. Mr. Uris has previously been one of my favorite authors. With eager expectation I picked this book to read.However, I find nothing in this book of redeeming value. I would classify it as a piece of trash. The writing is poor, the plot is poor, and the book is filled with extremely foul language, sexual situations, and political bias.I don't often throw away books, but I am tossing this one in the dumpster so no one else in my family is tempted to absorb its filth."
1,Shockingly Poor,"On the heels of great books like Trinity, I was very surprised by this poor effort. Terrible character development, unbelievable dialogue. The book spends a great deal of time on what are obviously Uris' own political views at the expense of plot. It is so bad that I have a hard time believing Uris actually wrote it! Don't bother. Re-read Trinity instead."
1,Had to be written by an imposter,I have always considered Uris as one of the top writers and his works have not disappointed me ... until now. This poorly written book makes me think that it was written for a Hollywood screen play one weekend in order to generate a little cash flow. If I read it without knowing the author I would have tossed it thinking it was a dimestore novel. Save you money on this one.
1,Can't bring myself to finish it,"I pride myself in finishing every book I start. I've only broken that rule once before. Fortunately I've forgotten which book that was, hopefully I'll soon forget this one as well. I recall Leon Uris as being able to write very good books. I don't know what happened with the writing and editing of this book, but it really stinks. Thanks for the laughs, but I think I'll quit reading and retain my last shred of respect for Leon Uris."
1,Dreadful!,"I bought this book because it was written by Leon Uris. What a mistake! The book is dreadful! It is poorly written, poorly edited, and seems to be a parody of a novel. Did he write it tongue in cheak? It is choppy and poorly organized; the pacing is uneven at best. It seems like a decent outline for a good story that is poorly executed. How do ""they"" let work like this get published? It seems that ""they"" are just cashing in on Uris's good name. But how about the unsuspecting reader who puts out cash expecting a good read? It's not fair to the reader or to the reputation of one who has written some great books to put out such a weak excuse for a novel."
1,A Major Disappointment,"The worst thing about reading Leon Uris's ""A God in Ruins"" is that an astute reader knows that Uris is capable much better work. Just read ""Exodus"" and the trash that Uris serves up is especially bitter! It almost seems that the writer is tired with no new ideas, but he should not take that out on his readers."
1,A very poor effort.,"I have read all of the novels by Mr. Uris and have enjoyed mostof them, especially his two on Ireland. This one was a terribledisappointment. I find it to be nothing but 483 pages of left-wing propaganda. The characters are either saints or devils, and totally unbelievable. I hope Mr. Uris does better next time or retires."
1,"If you like Uris, avoid this garbage.","Tremendous disappointment from a big Uris fan. I can't ever remember discarding a dearly bought hardback book after a single reading but this one is in my hotel room trash can. This book is a travesty for anyone expecting the kind of deeply researched and informed novels that Leon Uris has produced in the past. I have to believe that most of Mr. Uris' ""research"" came from the NY Times and the White House/Hillary for Senate Press Offices. Avoid."
1,A God In Ruins,"I have been reading Leon Uris since, in high school in the 1950s, I picked up Battle Cry. Maybe the writer owes his New York friends so much that he put out this piece of trite pap. The NRA must have really pissed him off! The book is basically about one shallow character's fight for gun control in America. Characters are written in broad generalizations that show Uris spent his time in Ireland researching his books and decided that he can throw off his own country in stereotypes drawn from the shallow New York literary scene. I was lucky. I bought the paperback book on sale. I would be most disappointed had I paid full price."
1,"Horrible, Horrid, Terrible...","That pretty much sums it up. I think Uris had a go at proving the notion that if you gave 700 monkeys 700 typewriters, in 700 years they would reproduce every great work of English literature. They got the English part half right. Way to go boys, here's a banana."
1,I didn't know Leon Uris wrote soap operas,"Trite! Silly! Many years ago I read my first Leon Uris Novel, ""Battle Cry"",I liked it. Since then his books have been spotty. This is trash! Irish cop turned rancher, good priest, bad busniness man and mysterious parentage haunting the presidential candidate. It would not even make a good soap opera."
1,Utterly Dreadful!,"What happened to the brilliant author of Exodus, Trinity, and Redemption? I couldn't get past page 100 of this book. The characters have all the depth of the Saturday morning cartoons. The facts are mercilessly misrepresented. I think Uris either has Alzheimer's or this was written by a high school grandchild of his. I wish I could get my money back."
1,a major disappointment,A major disappointment from a previously great writer. I looked forward to this book when it came out and couldnt believe the poor writing and convoluted plot. There are no redeeming qualities to this book.
1,A disappointment from a great novelist.,"I couldn't believe the poor quality of writing and plot in this book. Leon Uris, after an absence of many years from the writing scene, bears no resemblance to the Leon Uris we knew. The plot is convoluted, the dialogue is juvenile and the ending is ridiculous."
1,Written by a ghost writer.,"Very, very disappointing. I have read all of Uris' books and feel ripped-off purchasing this one."
1,Poorly written diatribe,"Poorly researched, editted and written political diatribe. Not worth reading. Real disappointment after books like Mila 18. Uris has lost the touch and resorted to propaganda"
1,This book is boring and trite,"Trinity and Exodus are without doubt two of the best books ever written so I have to believe that this book was not written by Leon Uris. I almost always finish books no matter how boring, but I could not finish this one. I finally gave up in the war room discussing plans to liberate a CIA operative from Iran. Please Leon, write something good. I know you can do it."
1,Disappointment!,"The only thing I can say is, ""don't spend your money on this book."" I had looked forward to a new book from Leon Uris, but this is not it. Someone in a Leon Uris suit wrote this, not him. Perhaps the Microsoft Word Wizard did it...you know: ""Do you need help writing this book?"" Mr. Uris should have refused. I must admit, I could only read 100 pages---by that time, every cliche known had been used---tough Irish cop, secretive Jesuits, very young Mexican girl who falls for son of ranch owner etc., etc., etc. What has happened to this author?"
1,Don't Bother,"I did not bother to finish this book, giving up in disgust half way through. The lack of depth in this book, compared to ""Trinity"", ""Exodus"", and ""Armegeddon"", is appalling.This author use to be one of the best. Now he seems to be skating by on reputation. Maybe the paycheck was worth it."
1,An author in ruins,"A God in Ruins should be retitled An Author in Ruin. It is sad to see an author renowned for his painstaking research produce such a flimsy work. Uris has produced a piece of left-wing propaganda, painting the fictional Republican president as evil incarnate and his Democratic challenger as perfect. His portrayal of the issues involved in the debate over the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, is incredibly simplistic when one considers Uris' reputation for scholarship. His Exodus, Mila 18, Trinity, etc., all brought us a profound understanding of an important confict. This book is the work of someone either senile or bent on deepening our national political conflict rather than creating mutual understanding."
1,an absolute waste of time,I would have given this less than one star were that an option. There is nothing kind I can say about this pointless book. I question if Leon Uris even read this book let alone wrote it. I did finish it and kept waiting for something to catch my interest but that never happened.
2,Leon Uris wrote this???,I have always enjoyed Uris' books and his writing style. I can't believe he actually wrote this. I will admit that I'm only two-thirds into it and I have contemplated giving it up but I'm invested now and want to see how it ends. I just don't care about the characters and don't feel any drama in the story. Very disappointed.
1,The Author has done better,"I did not believe the intitial reviews on this book as I have read all the author's other books and thought they were excellent. A God In Ruins does not even come close to his other works.His story is disjointed, his characters have little depth and lack passion. If the author's intent was to make the reader question the intent of having the second ammendment in the 21st Century, he failed as the story just does not hold up.Try again!!"
1,Worst book I ever read,"I find it hard to believe that this piece of garbage was written by the same author who wrote Exodus, Trinity, Mila 18 and other brilliant novels. Either Mr. Uris had reached senility or the book was ghostwritten under his name. Don't bother. It will ruin your image of Leon Uris as a novelist."
2,Transparent political issues,"I see that Mr. Uris is a big fan of Bill Clinton, Al Gore and Jesse Jackson; and for re-writing the Bill of Rights. This book seems to only be his biased opinion of members of the leading parties in the US. As a novel, the book started well, and seemed to be leading some where, I couldn't put it down. Then after only half-way through the book, I was quickly disappointed. There was no climax. I only finished it because I bought it. If you buy the book, only do so for the first half or so. The rest is garbage."
1,I wish I had read other reviews before tackling this book,"I liked the way this book started. Then midway, I lost interest in the lives and times of the characters. This should have been done as an 750-word opinion piece on Clinton and gun control."
3,I'm not sorry I read it - I'm not sorry I liked it...,Thank goodness I read the book before I read the other reviews. It probably helps that I didn't buy the book with any other expectations from Mr. Uris (or his publishers) than to be entertained. Have I read better? Yes. Have I read worse? Most definitely.
2,A dissapointment,"I was prepared for the polically correct, ultra liberal slant, but not for the sophomoric writing. Uris must need money. He is either way past his prime or he hired a freshman lit major to write this and put Leon's name on it"
1,Wow--why did I read this book?,"Terribly slanted and contrived. You can tell he's a liberal! His bashing of conservative values and people is shameful. The only redeeming quality of this book was the section on Quinns military exploits.Don't bother reading this book if you actually know anything about religion, ethics, or technology. If your a bleeding heart liberal, you'll probably love it."
1,The worst Uris book ever!,"I honestly cannot believe Leon Uris wrote this book. I bothered to finish it only because I hoped he (Uris) would redeem himself. Now after having finished it and knowing the touted ""secret,"" I realize that I could have quit reading on any page and not regretted it. This ""secret"" which was supposed to be apex of the storyline, was a ""so what"" instead of the nation-shattering event as depicted in the book. If you are a Uris fan as I am, don't read this book and let it lower your impression of him. If you must read it, don't read it before driving or operating heavy machinery."
1,A previously superb author has betrayed his fans,"A huge disappointment! Cliche-ridden and more shallow than a soap opera summary. It starts out with predictable characters: the hero is brilliant and perfect; the anti-hero is brilliant and evil and all the woman are brilliant, beautiful and passionate. So much for creativity! But it gets worse. Halfway through you realize you were conned into thinking this is literature, when it is simply a position paper on gun control. If a prominent author wishes to write an essay to promote a personal political agenda, he/she ought at least to put a disclaimer on the cover."
1,Did Leon Uris Really Write this Book?,"Unfortunately, I was gravely disappointed by this book. I have read just about all of Leon Uris' fiction and looked forward to another fascinating piece of good historical fiction. Instead what A God In Ruins delivers is one-dimensional stereotypical characters, predictable events, and easy solutions. I didn't believe the plot or any of the characters. Worse, it was boring!"
1,Disappointed,"At least I only spent $1 to read this book from the library's rental collection. It falls far short of the author's earlier works. And where were the editors? Too many silly, silly mistakes: Milta Pass; Snyder (Snider); Camp (Campy); Greet for Greer; Eastern time 3 hours behind Pacific; main for Maine; prairie schoolers for prairie schooners; etc., etc. Apparently, the editors relied too much on their computer's spellchecker. I read to the end because it was Mr. Uris, but this book lacks real characters, is mostly unbelievable and is just too shallow. I could put up with the political (I agree with a lot of it), but whitewashing the Clintons turned me off. If you can't do better Mr. Uris (and HarperCollins), please hang it up."
1,"Worst book I've ever read from, once, a very good writer",Uris must have wanted to do his small bit for changing history regarding the Clinton administration at the expense of quality. What a lame excuse for a book. I was so disappointed as I thought Uris' other work was great. A God in Ruins is TRASH. Don't waste your time reading this. I'd like to get my money back.
1,Political position paper disguised as a novel,"I own every novel written by Uris, and have read most of them more than once, so when I heard a new was forthcoming I grabbed it.This is no novel. It is a political treatise with no attempt at disguise. When Uris portrays gun owners as Heehaw loving denizens of trailer parks the bile of his stereotypical prejudices drips from the page. I can accept the numerous errors, and the convoluted plotline, but not the attempt to shove his veiws down my throat.While Mr. Uris is entitled to his beliefs, he has no right to pass them off as a novel. An authours views should color a work, but not in this ham handed fashion. You owe us one."
1,"Save the full purchase price, DON'T BUY IT!!!","The other customer comments I have read relative to this book give Mr Uris too much credit. The amazon.com review is pure tripe! This story starts out as if it were going to be a 'real' Leon Uris novel but at the halfway mark, the author passes away as does the story line. Mr Uris has chosen this book to pass off his somewhat skewed social/political agenda as a literary work--with worse than disastrous results. If you believe, as Paul Harvey recently said: ""It must be the guns"" and/or that Bill and Hillary are two totally innocent, morally upright individuals or that Bill is among the holy innocents, abused and wrongly accused, then, this book is for you. Otherwise, stay away. (I only finished this book because I was stuck on an airplane, on the ground, for over an hour and a half and all the cross-word puzzles in the air mag were done!)"
1,This book is far beneath what I expected from Leon Uris.,"I am a long-time fan of Leon Uris's works, particularly his earlier books. So, it was with great expectations that I bought A God In Ruins almost immediately after its release. I have read only 150 pages, and will read no more. In fact, I was tempted to quit earlier, but feel you must give a book some time to come together.A God In Ruins never does come together. It is one of the most disjointed storylines I have ever seen. It is almost jarring it jumps around so much from time to time, place to place, character to character. Simply put, it is a jumble.I have also found it to be incredibly poorly written, almost to the point of annoyance. I am not certain how old Leon Uris is now, but I kept thinking he must be approaching senility and has lost his gift. It saddens me because I have gotten so much pleasure from reading him in the past. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Unfortunate Indeed.,"I am glad I finished this book. I am glad I read it despite the meagre two stars I have awarded it. Having read Mila 18, I have probably started my Uris ""experience"" on a high note. I cannot say how much I truly enjoyed that book. However, this book...I understand that a book is truly a symbol or a mouthpiece in many cases for an authors philosophy and socio-political leanings. In this case it seems that Mr Uris really wrote with his heart on his sleeve without really remaining with the mechanics of the story. He failed to excercise his craft properly. Yes you saw it here first. He was intent on waxing maudlin and commented too plainly from within his personal belief system. If anyone reads this they will surely shake their heads and state, ""Is this not true of every book? Why else does an author write?"" That would be correct, as long as you do not lose track of the story."
2,Disconnected plot lines - Unbelievable Premise,"From a fascinating launch that promises intriguing plot lines built around the question, ""How much anti-Jewish predjudice survives in America?,"" the novel careens off in other directions only, at the end, to return to its initial anti-Semitism focus. Indeed, most of the book stands as an anti-NRA polemic . . . interesting, but quite different from the theme Uris introduces in the opening section of the book. Main characters are unidimensional at best . . . either incredibly ""good"" or incredibly ""bad."" In summary, the book is a series of unconnected threads that float quite apart from any disciplined integration into a meaningful narrative fabric."
1,An author in Ruins,"Leon Uris has often been a ""Gun for Hire."" While this poorly crafted anti-gun screed shows occasional sparks of his former skills, it lacks their balance. Handgun Control Incorporated did not get what they paid for."
1,A God in Ruins,"I was very disappointed with this book, it is one of the few books I have discarded before finishing.What I originally mistook for a work of literature was in essence a lenthy editorial by the author. Stereotyped characters and poorly developed story line didn't give this opinionated writing sufficent credibility to survive as a novel. What a disappointment from the historical perspectives of his previous works."
1,An Almost Treacherous Disappointment,"I actually felt betrayed. The book, and especially the dialogue, reads like a seventies TV miniseries. Very shallow, stereotyped characters, a ridiculous plot, overt moralizing, and an anticlimactic climax. The only -- and I mean the only -- interesting thing in the book is a commando rescue mission in the middle of the book. The editors deserve special blame, not only for missing obvious mistakes but also for not trying to whip the book into shape."
1,"If I start a book, I finish it - but this one wasn't easy!","A new book by Leon Uris! Of course I would buy it! I could hardly wait to read it. I didn't bother reading the reviews. Too bad! It was one of the worst books from one of the (once) best writers. If the name Leon Uris hadn't been on the cover, I would have thought it written by/for junior high school. And such corny, one dimensional characters! AARRGGHH! and UGH!"
3,WAS IT URIS?,"Very weak and very plain. Why did you write Mr. Uris? Where are the passion, knowledge, ideas, and characters. What happened? Take it back, Mr. Uris, and pretend that it never happened."
1,What a disappointment,"I was so excited to find a Leon Uris book that I had not read, th I was eager with anticipation. I got about halfway through the book before I became so disgusted that I had to put it down. I thought, ""is it that I'm prejudice because don't agree with his politics which are so blantanly displayed in the novel, or is this book as incredibly poorly written as I feel it is?"". I checked on this sight (too bad I didn't do that first) and saw that my opinion was indeed echoed by many other reviewers. I love Leon Uris and have read all of his previous novels - some twice. Do not waste you time on this drivel. It is poorly written, the characters are unrealistic and it is frankly, boring.For those of you who have never read Uris, I suggest you stick with his other novels. As many others have said, I question whether he actually wrote this garbage."
1,A dreadful book.,"This had to have been the worst book I've ever read. The story line jump constantly, such that I re-read paragraphs to see if I missed something.The back cover of the book mentioned an explosive secret, and that was the only reason I continued to read it. Once it was revealed, I couldn't help but think that even a predictable, government conspiracy type secret would have been better.I can't believe I read this book. I can't believe I bought this book. I've never sold a book to a used book store before, but I think I'll get rid of this one. It doesn't deserve to sit on my bookshelves.On top of it, I didn't appreciate his sermonizing. His AMERIGUN was an obvious attempt to negatively portray the NRA, of which I am a life member."
1,A God in Ruins,"Having read literally thousands of books with Leon Uris being one of my favorite authors, I can honestly say that I was extremely disappointed by this book. It is poorly edited with numerous flashbacks that are very confusing. For example, events are referred to that have not yet occurred. The author seems to have as a prime objective the furthering of his own political agenda at the expense of a rational plot. The characters seem to have little depth and their actions do not seem realistic."
1,Bad writing,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. Being a big fan of Leon Uris, I expected much more. The characters were so stereotypical, I laughed in disgust. The simplifications of complicated political ideas were equally annonying. No more Leon Uris for me."
1,Who wrote this book?,I also wish I'd read the reviews before reading this book. Leon Uris has written some of my favorite books. I now question if I was misled in my opinion of his skills. Terribly disappointing.
1,MIA in the Culture War,"The question begs. Would he have written this book if he knew that a substantial number of his readers would tumble it into the wastebasket as soon as the message emerged? This reader made it to page 160 and has learned that others more astute bagged it considerably earlier.It appears that the arthor laid a trap for a considerable portion of his life-long readership fully intending to slap them in the face for their loyalty. Contrary to Uris' characterization of the ""American Gun Culture"", the bulk of those interested in reading political and historical novels come from just that sector of modern society. Uris has really done mischief to his legacy."
1,Disappointing...,"Having read all of Uris' books (and almost all of them more than once) I can properly say that this was by far the weakest and shallowest one. I couldn't stop reading books like EXODUS, TRINITY or REDEMPTION, but I had to force myself to read this one.The story and the characters are weak, as plenty of other reviews have pointed out -- I have nothing to add to them.Another negative point goes to the research: in a scene supposedly set in the late 70's, you read ""People have gladly traded their freedom for a web site""; a couple of pages later you find a URL (web address), and then someone inserts a CD into a computer! Internet didn't exist then, and CD's are a 90's invention! The references to SCARAB (in actual life, OSPREY) are also wrong, for the aircraft started flying in the 80's. And, finally, the supposed BULLDOG computer/security device/composer/etc. is ludicrous!I sure wish I had read the reviews first: I thought that with Uris I couldn't go wrong, but..."
1,Leon Hubris?,"It is difficult to believe that the man who wrote Exodus and Trinity could pen such unmitigated tripe. It was all I could do to finish it. I would have pitched it, but it was the only thing I had on a long plane flight, and I became fascinated, wondering just how bad it could actually get. Beyond my worste imaginings. One of his statements is so absurd it defies description. Uris says that Bill & Hillary Clinton suffered more than any other couple in history! In all history? This alone demonstrates how hopelessly out of touch Uris is with reality -- or history. His take on gun ownership is likewise stupifying. I could go on and on, but all you need to know is -- don't waste your valuable time. I should have just reread the inflight magizine 20 times. The only thing I have read in the past 10 years that was this bad was ""The Horse Whisperer."""
1,I'm sorry but this book is a total waste of time,"I am so happy to see other reviewers express their extreme disappointment in this book...in my opinion, it is one of the best examples of a great author who doesn't know when to put down his pen. The plot is totally disjointed and unrealistic, the characters are poorly developed and stereotypical, the political agenda espoused by Mr. Uris is non-original ultra-liberal tripe disguised as common sense, and the Jewish persecution complex weighs heavily through the final chapters of the book. My advice to Mr. Uris is 'please retire' and leave writing to those authors who enjoy giving their public a well-thought-out and balanced product. I for one will never invest in another Uris book."
2,Shooter,Very disappointing. The book turned ridiculously political about halfway through and insultingly oversimplified some of the most complex issues of the last decade.
1,I will now read the readers reviews on line before buying.,"The jacket looked good; I've enjoyed all of his other novels, but this one was a bomb! It really insulted me to be lectured about his political opinions. The character development and plot line stopped dead in their tracks as he poured out his philosphy on gun-control; anti-semitism; and other political issues. What a waste of time and money!"
1,What a let down!,"My aunt, knowing what a dedicated Leon Uris fan I am, purchased this book for me on her very limited income. I feel like her money was totally wasted...the book lacks the well-researched, historical background that has been so characteristic of his other novels. The character development is superficial compared to earlier works, and the writing style is reminiscent of pulp fiction. Leon Uris must have been desperate for revenue when he cranked this one out...it's a real stinker, in my opinion."
1,Not worth the time,"There are far better books to read, and whatever you are reading is better than this. I finished it, hoping for some energy, some type of crescendo that would make it worth my while. Alas, right down to the poem on the last page that I read three times hoping I would understand what Uris was going for, this book is a major disappointment. While the story is timely certainly, never does it rise to anything that draws the reader in or excites us. It's drab and boring."
1,Written for the money with a stereotypical political agenda,"Bad. When I think of all the great Leon Uris stories that I have read, this one is a real disappointment. Stereotyping, worn-out political cliches, the works. The sad thing is that he has a message that probably needs to be sent and to be examined, it seems that he no longer knows how to do it."
1,Soap opera masquerading as seious literature.,"Uris, who has told a good story in the past despite his clunky, pretentious writing style, struck out this time. The story, if you can stay with it, strays all over the map, is overblown and over dramatized. A pot-boiler."
1,Horrible!,"Read The Triumph and the Glory, or read Exodus again, or even try one of Oprah's books, but under absolutely no circumstances should you venture remotely near this book. It is bad, bad, bad."
4,Unusual,"Hommlet was unusual, because it used a setting that few other of the modules (or pre-designed adventures for role-playing games, usually so named because they were a series) ever bothered to investigate--a small town. Also, the graphics (from what little I saw of them--this is one of the few modules that I played, instead of DM'ed) were sharply printed and unusually clear for TSR. Like the previous reviewer, I do, indeed, wish we could go back."
3,needs size,what does size 22 mean? there is no sizing guide. I am very interested by have no idea what size to buy my dog.thanks
4,Motorola Did it right!,"Over the years, I have been with many different carriers (Sprint, Verizon, US Cellular, AT&T, and Prime Co.) and NONE of them could compete with Nextel. The call quality is incredible, customer support is great, and I can't argue with per second billing. As far as this phone... It it amazing! Easy to use, many useful features with all the ""clutter"" and the call quality is very good. I would reccommend Nextel and this phone to anybody that wants a no nonsence phone that actually works!"
2,Poor reception,"The i88s is not a bad phone, it's just not a good phone. Like an earlier reviewer said, the charging system stinks. I've replaced two chargers (car and home) just to keep this thing up and running. The reception is bad. It's not nextel it's the phone. I've held my phone with the antenna up next to my friends nextel phone with his antenna down. He had full reception I had one bar! I've broke two antennas because they are long on this phone and you must have them up to use it. Nextel charges you $40 each antenna. Look for another phone."
2,ALWAYS BROKE!!!!,The phone and phone functions are great but after having the phone for 3-4 months the phone will no longer charge. I could understand this happening once or twice BUT I've got the insurance on the phone and I've had it replaced for the same reason 7 times. Motorola and Nextel must come up with a more sturdy way to charge the phone...the charger system that they have on ALL the phones stink BUT the i88 is the worse. I've only had one problem with the i95 in a year....I guess that's not TOO bad????
1,Simply useless,"If you have no clue what a pthread function name is, or what this crazy multithreading idea is all about, then maybe this book will help you some...but I have my doubts. Otherwise, this serves as both a poor reference, a poor primer guide, a poor advanced guide, and poor toilet paper. I've never seen a book manage to miss as a reference, miss as a primer, and miss as an advanced guide. There are easily better books and online resources available, as it's hard to be much worse than this.This book is akin to learning French by teaching some basic grammar, some advanced grammar, and then shouting: ""Je ne sais pas!"" ""Je voudrais un peu cherise!"" without telling you what these mean...and leaving you clueless as to how to find out about them."
3,No as good as It looks like.,"This Book covers too many topics unnecessarily, so when you really want to go a little deep into a specific field and make yourself clear, that will be not possible.This book is not really suitable for real multi-threaded programmer.New multi-threaded leaners maybe will found it useful for basic concepts."
5,Wonderful!,"The authors of this book, in addition to their knowledge of threads, also know how to teach. The only shortcoming I could point out is that certain topics are treated shallowly, while less important topics are explained with too much detail.What's really interesting about the book is the authors' ``don't do that'' style. Another reviewer found this style to be bad. I found it highly helpful. Instead of presenting a single solution for a problem (``The One and Only True Solution''), and leaving the reader wondering about alternative solutions, they go on to explain what's wrong with these other solutions. People learn by making mistakes, and the authors point out lots of mistakes that can be avoided. This is an invaluable feature, not a bug."
2,Where is the source-code for download?,This book didn't supply source code for download neither attach CD-ROM. How can I verify whether it's true?
5,Good Book,"This is a quick and wonderful read. For example, in Genesis, he points out that psychological transformation and the eventual recognition of moral and social responsibility are played out in a unique generational context from Abraham to Joseph. He makes this and other valid points that certainly take the bible away from simple ""fundamentalist"" interpretations.For any observance level, Jewish or Christian I highly recommend this book. Its not boring. There are nuggets of insight and wisdom in every chapter."
2,Not Gluten Free,"Um, if it has barley in it then it's not gluten free. The label says ""with barley."" For people who are less knowledgeable about food allergies and purchase this for themselves or another, it could cause some serious issues. Whoever classifies this food, Amazon or the manufacturer, should probably explain their labels better or remove the gluten free classification. It's very misleading."
2,Disappointed and Offended,"I like McDougall's soups and was taken by the concept that theyare virtually non fat and provide fiber etc I am most disappointedto find the manufacturer attempts deception of the consumer bylisting the nutritional values for one serving, whereas, in fact,the values are for half a package. McDougall has lost all credibilityfor me and I will not be purchasing again. It is offensive to treatconsumers in this way.Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Split Pea Soup, Lower Sodium, 1.9-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)"
1,Yuck!,"I know a dried soup isn’t going to be great. But I was expecting this to be eatable. The texture is mealy. It has a weak, artificial smoked flavor. I’m a vegetarian. I was craving split pea soup. I could only manage to eat two spoonful of this yucky stuff."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,"This product claims it is ""vegan and gluten free"" but references smoked ham flavoring in the product description and barley is NOT gluten-free!Very disappointing."
4,The best of his soups,This is by far my favorite of his soup flavors. The water line seems to be slightly too high & will boil over at about a minute & thirty seconds if you fill it to the line. Otherwise it works great.
4,"Easy, quick, healthful snack","I'm a huge McDougall cuppa soup fan. I've tried them all and the Split Pea is my favorite. It's creamy with bits of barley and reconstituted dehydrated veggies. I always feel good about reaching for a cuppa instead of some unhealthy snack with lots of useless calories.I agree with other reviewers regarding the portion size. There's no way to eat half the contents of the cup and save the rest for later or share with someone. The labelling should be changed to reflect that the container holds one serving, not two, and all the nutrition facts should be changed accordingly."
5,fabulous,"low low fat, vegan and tastes greathonestly, not many food products in the entire world like thiswish i had found out about it lot lot soonerno animal products - how awesome!!!great for health, convenient, delicious - need i say more!"
1,NOT GLUTEN FREE,"Even though the description claims that this soup is gluten-free, it certainly is not. Any soup containing barley is not gluten-free, as barley is a source of gluten. This is also true of most of this company's soups - they all claim to be gluten-free, but contain things like barley and pasta.I would give negative stars if possible for this careless misinformation."
4,pea soup,"I love this stuff, but, it does not love me. Tends to give gas. Does anyone know of a vegetarian split pea that doesn't?"
1,Disgusted!,"I was so excited to get these vegan soups. The packaging is so deceiving with a name like Dr. McDougall and vegan. Unfortunately I didn't read the other reviews before purchasing like I usually do. And I read the ingredient label after they arrived. They have MSG aka ""yeast extract"" and ""natural flavors and cannot be returned according to Amazons return policy. Waste of my hard earned money. Lesson learned!"
1,Way too much SALT,"I've been following the McDougall/Esselstyn plant based diet. The results have been great - massive weight loss, lower cholesterol, etc.As part of that plan I've cut out a lot of salt. This product has HIGH SODIUM. I was shocked when I read the numbers. Had Dr. McDougall sold out? I thought I'd be safe ordering any product he sells. I was wrong. I won't eat this and have wasted my money."
3,too big for me,"This is a LOT of soup for one and who wants to/can ""save"" some? It's blander than the other instant pea soup I've had, but not bad. I won'torder it again, but that's just me.....I like this brand of instant oatmeal, but it is also TOO big for one serving! Enough already!! Noteverything has to be ""supersized""!"
1,NASTY,"I love pea soup, so it seemed like a no brainer to buy this. I mean seems like a good buy, easy to make and no hassle cleanup, right?WRONG!This stuff is so gross. I followed the instructions to a T and the stuff was gross and had the weirdest consistency of any soup I've ever had. I'm only lucky I bought this using a $5 Amazon gift card I had, otherwise I would have been out $10 of my own money instead of just $5.Bleh, the smell is pretty gross too, its still lingering in my kitchen. Think I'll just give these to my health freak friend, she'll eat anything so long as its organic and vegan, no matter how crappy it tastes."
3,"Good soup, bad instructions","These are the instructions on the cup: ""Remove fresh flavor packet. Add water to fill line. Stir. Microwave 1 min 40 seconds. Stir. Cover. Let stand 5 minutes. Stir & Enjoy."" Until I saw this site, I had no idea when to dump the flavor packet in. I ended up sticking it in at the end. I don't cook often. I think the instructions should be clearer about when the packet gets dumped in, just in case it effects stir-ability or taste. Unless it doesn't matter, and then they should at least say that. It did not seem to make a difference in flavor, but it was clumpy and hard to stir when I put it in at that point. It did taste good, though."
2,Very poorly made,"These cable are very cheaply made. WIthin a small amount of use, the jacket will disconnect form the connector. You'll also probably break the locking clip within a few months."
5,Does almost everything I want out of this sort of device,"I've had one of these for a couple of years now, and it's worked flawlessly. The advantage over the much more expensive FM transmitter type iPod docks is huge.I almost took off one star because it doesn't pause the iPod when the 12V power drops. If it did that, it would be perfect."
3,"good, serious devotional book","The reader must be interested in a) The Benedictine Rule and b) interpreting and applying The Rule in a contemporary and non-monastic setting for this to be useful. But, given those criteria, it will be useful to readers who have been serious about their faith journey for some time. There is a workbook by the same author that I found to be slightly more helpful."
1,What a crock,"There is no book called Qabala. Qabala (also spelled Cabala, Kabbalah) is a SYSTEM of philosophy which tries to understand the metaphysics of God. It's practioners study ancient texts, LIKE THE TORAH OR OLD TESTAMENT.And for the other reviewer who mentioned George Bush; it's common knowledge both he and his dad were members of Yales Skull and Bones society. The building which houses the society has many decorative and architectural symbols that are derived from Freemason symbology. The US system of government was created by many who were Freemasons, and they belief of equality, freedom, democracy were Masonic goals. I suggest if you don't like this than you can emigrate to some country that still has a working monarchy.If you want to know more about Kabbalah you're much better off getting a scholarly work by a religious scholar like Gershom Scholem."
2,Very thin scholarship,"I was excited to get this book - I mean for [amt.]+ shipping and a long title it should have some solid writing, information and references.Boy, what a mistake!The subject is interesting, and Alomari does hit the high points of the topics. But, that's where it ends! The writing is very thin, and nonsubstantial. The pages (only 111 of them) have very large type and empty pages between the chapters.Truth is, I did not even finish the book! I got 2/3 's of the way through and found it was like reading a final history paper written by the student the night before it was due.I gave the book 2 stars only because the subject itself is facinating. And, the book could be helpful for someone trying to get an overview on the subject. On the plus side, it is very readable.But, it isn't worth the [amt.] plus shipping for that. You can get this info. off the web in a few hours. Save you money and check into some of the other books on the subject."
1,This book is Rubbish,Mohammad Alomari has written trash claiming to be scholarship. There never was a book called the Qabalah as it comes from the oral teachings of Judaism and the schools of the prophets. The Old and New Testaments are filled with Qabalistic symbols and numerology. For example the numbers 22 and 32 have major significance. I advise people to read books here on Jewish and Christian Qabalah to get an idea of what I am talking about to gain proper understanding.
5,A great starting point!,"If a book can provide a launching point to further research and study - on the topics discussed in this book... then this book is a true winner! There are many books which go into detail after detail often loosing the reader, this book is consise and to the point. Where it does not expand, it leaves the reader room to conduct further research. One of the reviewers mentioned researching other books by other authors; its interesting how the same author used the exact same books as references for his book as well. So you see... the ideas of this book come from notable references. I think this is a wonderful book for anyone ready to dive into the truth of the world. Sometimes reality is more surreal than the movies... but you would never think that because that's just ""crazy thinking""... right?The truth will set you free!And what you don't know... might kill you."
3,I'll Pass,I am an African American woman and my daughter and I have different lengths of relaxed hair. Using this tool was akward and I didn't find it to do much more than using my yellow bird with the comb attachment. It made the drying time take so much longer and I still had to follow up with a flat iron on my daughter's hair after using this. I ended up purposely tearing it apart to make two hair brushes out of it instead.
4,Scalpmaster Ceramic Thermal Hair Straightener,I use to as a pass through when I am flat ironing my hair. When I use it my hair gets really straight. I do feel it puts your hair so you got to be careful.
3,Not good for very thick hair,I bought this product because a friend recommended this type of brush to blow dry my very thick hair mixed race hair. It does not glide through my hair smoothly as I would have liked. I ended up borrowing my friend's european brand ceramic brush which worked better than this one. I believe it was because the bristles were longer. This brush is better for thinner hair gals.
3,absolutely not for beginers !!!,+AH4-I am a Computer Science student who wanted to dig deeper into the phisics behind networks and communication technology. Well all the programming that I know is useless with the Furier Transfer mathemetics and so on. A lot of catching up to do if that name doesn't sound familiar. Some serious science ahead!!!+AH4-
1,Waste of Money,"The vaccination dilemma doesn't discuss vaccines. The book is scattered & disorganized. It gives little to no info on vaccines and none of it is backed up with data. The author then jumps off onto a chapter on Treating Childhood Illnesses and preaching the gospel of Anthroposohic medicine??? What does any that have to do with vaccines??? The only potentially descent chapter was on Treating the Effects of Vaccinations. However, she gave no information so it too was a miss. This is a terrible book, avoid it. There are so many other better ones that describe the vaccines, their pros & cons, how to avoid & legally exempt your child, how to administer them safety, and how to treat potential side effects. My favorite is the vaccination book by Dr. Stephanie Cave."
3,helpful in relation to childhood illnesses,One thing which supports the current vaccination program is parental fear of childhood illnesses--this book does a good job of exploring the role of certain sicknesses in the normal development of children.Not a great book if you need detailed information on vaccines--I'd recommend the Romm book if that is what you need.
5,Great book for anybody interested in chakras,"Great book for anybody interested in chakras. It not only explains what chakras are, but it gives practical examples of when chakras are not working properly plus excercises to improve the working of the chakras. Very complete, very clear, very informative. I always have this book on my nightstand and every once in a while I read specific parts of it, depending on what I feel me or somebody in my environment needs."
4,Not quite a 5,"Good quality product from Lund Industries. Fit is perfect. Note that the description on Amazon states ""Rear in-channel..."". This can be misleading as these are for the front windows of a Ford Ranger. The word ""rear"" apparently refers the fact that they install from inside the window channel as opposed to the type that adhere to the outside, over the windows. The only reason I didn't rate this product a 5 is due to a couple of very small scratches on the visors which are hardly visible, but I am picky when it comes to my trucks. Also, I have a set of 4 of these same visors on another truck (Ford Super Duty). They are now 8 years old and look just like they did when new and none of them has come loose. I highly recommend them."
3,"Great for couples, not so for singles.","I am a single woman who is eager to expand my practice and understanding of orgasm. I find this book very important in its spirituality and approach. However, it seems that the progress and education described in this book is best, and just about only, achieved by couples, despite occasional remarks by the author to dispel this notion. Sadly, I'll have to leave this on the shelf until there is someone to explore with."
5,A beautiful book; give it to your lover,"author of DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF: A PERSONAL APPROACH TO DREAM INTERPRETATION and DREAM BACK YOUR LIFETHE ART OF SEXUAL ECSTASY is a beautiful book, tastefully illustrated with well-written text. Teaches you how to add intimacy to your lovemaking while honoring sexual satisfaction and mutual respect. It will improve your communication with your partner and offers new ways to revitalize your intimate time, including creating a sacred space."
1,I Don't Believe It,"I think this book is made up of a bunch of baloney. I don't believe a word of it. I think that way too much importance is placed on sex, to the point of being obsessed with it. It's about a bunch perverts, in my opinion. The author's interest and obsession with sex is not normal. It appears she thinks of nothing else in life, except sex, and who to have it with."
3,Ok,"This book is more long-winded and poetic than the Heart of Tantric Sex. I have to admit I prefer the latter as it's more concise. However you would enjoy this book if you had a partner who really wanted to come along with you on the Tantric journey, it's very much aimed at couples and has many creative activities you can try."
3,Sex = Ecstasy,"Oh, if only that were true.This book makes that equation more true. Once you get beyond the strangeness of the exercises and explore the opportunites within your self and your partner for appreciating the body and the wonder of sharing your body with another, you have learned a lot about becoming someone who truly enjoys intimacy and who can share that enjoyment with a partner.Great book."
4,"""Art"" of Sexual Exstasy",Very informative. Wonderful way to grow. I would recommend every couple to read and experience love making in the ways described.
2,It was ok but too graphic,It was recommended by a doctor but I consider it to be too graphic. That is all I can or will say about it. So please do not send me any more request for comments
2,good until it breaks,"almost any HGTV looks good....until something goes wrong. Mine is less than two years old, and the only color on the screen is now green....no red, no blue, etc. Panasonic referred me to a local ""certified repair shop"" so far, that has cost me $205, and the repair lasted less than one hour. They are coming back to try again. Note the only thing Panasonic will pay for after one year is a picture tube...and so far, that isn't the problem as DVDs work well and the color is good."
3,32 inch Panasonic PureFlat Screen,"I am disappointed with the quality of this TV. I had a 27 inch Panasonic that received a much better picture. There is a line running vertical through the center of the TV, about an inch thick, which distorts the picture. When I increase the volume, white noise becomes very apparent. I am forced to run the TV sound through my stereo system to compensate. I have a service man coming out today. Hopefully, these problems are covered by warranty, otherwise, I will be looking at a $300 service call (estimated), and then the cost of parts. I have always liked Panasonic products, but this TV set was quite a bit of money, and I wish I had made a different choice, even if it would have cost more."
4,"Had to think about it for a while, but so glad I bought it!!","I am not a rich man (at least not any more!), but this was fully worth the hefty price tag. I am the envy of all my friends now that I have it. I did only give 4 stars as it did cost me my wife, house, car, and dog to get....but it's worth it...I think..."
3,How to Set,"Hi, for people having issues setting these traps, because they don't trip, I found that cutting a tiny bit off the end of the lock bar fixed the issues. The bars are too long on some of the traps to come off the cheese plate when pressure is applied. Hope this helps."
4,These are GREAT!,"These traps are what you find at your local Safeway supermarket, and yes, this is where I get them when I need them.I think most people rate these badly because they have high expectations. These are are not meant to be the Rolls Royce of mouse traps. I believe they were meant for one purpose and one purpose only: to be set, hang out and catch mice. These are typically a one-time use item for me. The trick for me is placing these traps where you see lots of droppings. They will return there and it takes no longer than 2 days to catch them.The yellow cheese plate is only a comical representation. You really should shove something like a small piece of ham under the triangular tap so it they tug on it a little to trip the spring.These work MUCH better than the high tech stuff. I even have a ""poison pill"" trap where they've only taken a couple nibbles and never returned, but once I set these traps, I get a mouse the next day."
1,Look for the old style,1 star is being overly generous.I didn't buy mine from Amazon. But I have been trying these and find themuseless. The mice seem to think they are a deli bar...either they eat the bait and it doesn't go off...or it goes off on its on.Then they come and eat the bait.Its either that or I have Houdini trained mice.I won't be trying these ever again.
1,Easy set?,"Worst mousetrap ever!! I purchased 2 4 packs, could only set 2 out of 8. The 2 that worked set easily, but the other 6 will not set. I carefully read through the comments from others that explained how they had no problems, but no technique that they mentioned works. I am assuming the company has little or no quality control. Worthless and dangerous. I wish I could have given them zero stars."
1,JUNK,"These traps are the worse piece of junk I ever bought. Impossible to set, especially if you're using peanut butter and the rod gets oily. Forget it: you'll surely lose a few fingers but you'll never catch any mouse. Avoid at all cost."
2,THE MOUSE THAT DIDN'T ROAR,"COMPARED TO MORE SOPHISTICATED MOUSE TRAPS, IT IS TIME TOR ETIRE THIS DEVICE. IT IS ALL BUT IMPOSSILBE TO SET AND I HAD MY FINGERS SLAPPED MANY TIMES IN ATTEMPTS TO SET THE TRAPS. A DEFINITE PASS."
1,Does not hold when set - DO NOT BUY THIS!,"I have a few ""Victor"" mousetraps I bought locally a couple years ago, but needed more because my wife sees mouse traps as one time use devices and throws the whole thing out when they catch something. I figured it was fine to buy this batch online since it is the same Victor brand. These were terrible. All 4 when set would not even hold under their own weight once I flipped them right side up. Forget about putting any peanut butter on the trap. The two old ones still work fine. These are very, very cheaply made and don't work. Do not waste your money. I feel ripped off, but I am not about to bother with the whole returns process for three bucks."
1,"junk, dangerours",I should have read the reviews for this before buying it. These things are extremely dangerous to set and they go off randomly. THEY DON'T WORK! Will try to return.
1,Absolute Junk!,"I disagree with the reviewer who states that one side of the yellow plastic bait seat is not sensitive.Thes things cannot be set unless you have the hands of a surgeon and set them ""in place""Then...if you do get it set after several attempts, then walk softly or as you walk away, the trap will go off.I am having trouble finding the original metal bait seat version which is perplexing.Why would they replace something that works perfectly with something that isAbsolute junk!...?Forgive the annoyed tone of this....I just finished the tenth attempt to set one of these ridiculous things under a sink cabinet, where it is nescessary to set it THEN move it into place.Not possible with these yellow bait seats."
2,"Poor quality, hard to set, get the old fashion ones","I've had a lot of experience using these and I don't like them. They are so poorly made that half are impossible to set, because the bar that attaches to the bait paddle wasn't installed correctly. Sometimes you can bend it and get it to work, but then it may or may not be sensitive enough to activate when a mouse touches the paddle. I've gone back to the store, and bought more, thinking it was a bad lot, but have had the same problem over and over. Forget baitless, the traps still need to be baited. I recommend smearing peanut butter across the paddle. After throwing away the half that can't be set, the remaining ones do catch mice, but I recommend buying the traditional snap trap with a metal bait petal. Victor still sells them on their website, and recently Home Depot started selling them. They are actually much easier to set and of a recent package of four, all four set easily, and each one caught mice."
1,mice love this trap!,"if you want to keep your mice fat & happy, this is the trap to get. nothing fattens up a mouse more than a great buffet table. i bought eight traps, three would not engage, three ""snapped"" but caught no mice, but they enjoyed the peanut butter. one did not ""snap"", but all of the peanut butter was gone, and another one did not ""snap"" but most of the bait was taken.....do not waste your $$ on these; unless you love mice......"
1,It Certainly isn't a BETTER MOUSE TRAP!,It is a piece of junk that snaps down on your finger or just triggers off on its own.........It certainly is a step backwards from the metal traps.......in essence in the 21 Century they still haven't invented a BETTER MOUSE TRAP.........
2,"Almost impossible to set, but a possible solution?","I agree with the reviewers who describe how difficult these traps are to set.I liken it to bomb disposal where the trap might explode at any moment [and frequently does...]And one does get very tense and protective of one's fingers...I was on the point of returning my 4 packs of these traps when I had a thought.After baiting and setting the trap, I placed a screwdriver shank along the pedal hinge [i.e. under the pedal, at right-angles to the trap] to support the pedal in its ~45 degree position.I then placed the trap in position and gently eased the screwdriver out from underneath the pedal.My success rate for setting these traps has gone from 0% to 100%.Logic dictates that the greater surface area of the pedal [as compared with the Victor metal variety] should yield a greater kill rate. We shall see. 1:1 kills-to-trap-sprung ratio so far.So take heart -- don't throw these away just yet!"
1,Junk,"Wont set...took to youtube and here to see if I was doing it wrong. I was not, just to hard to get to set. Really bad product. This review is for the plastic version of the old reliable metal trap."
1,So frustrating!!,"So sensitive I cannot even sit the damn thing down on the floor, even when I TRY to set it on the firm side. So sensitive if you do get it on the floor it goes off too easily and does not always get the mouse. It is unfortunate this is the only snap trap the store I went to sells."
1,frustrating,"this has got to be one of the worst products ive seen lately.....i have a little problem, i buy a product to resolve problem, not only does the product NOT solve the problem but makes things much worse.....these traps do not set easily...only buy them if you dont want the problem to be solved.....ive bought 4 packs of 4 and only have been able to use 2 traps... uuuugh!"
2,"If it isn't defective, or impossible to set, works great","""Easy set"" - man, that is the most false of any claim I've seen on a product.So, in a set of 4, two were completely defective (one had no spring action, the other was missing a piece and could not be set). Of the other two, we were only successful in setting one of them.Successful? Only after a dozen attempts to set it, getting stung fingers and scaring the hell out of us.Once set, very effective! Caught two of the little beasts, one within 5 minutes of setting it. However, trying to set it a third time was impossible. The only thing I can think of is there was some problem where this flimsy item got misaligned or messed up so it couldn't set anymore. :-(I'm hoping the Snap-E trap that is arriving soon is easier to set and is sturdier. I'm willing to pay more for that."
1,Traps cannot be set,"I bought 3 packs of 4 of these traps, Victor M038. Of the 12 traps I could only get 2 of them to set, the yellow trigger plate does not work with the latch at all. There was no way possible to get the traps to set, very frustrating."
1,The plastic ones are useless,"I have tried these plastic cheese ones. They have never caught anything. Luckily I can still get the old metal ones. I put a raisen smeared with peanut butter. They catch the mice. Out of curiosity I used both traps in the same area in my crawl space. All of the metal ones caught a mouse none of the ""cheese"" ones did."
1,Mouse not heavy enouh to trigger this,"I've tried these over the last few weeks, I got a package of 4 of them. The problem is that the design is really pretty bad and the mouse isn't heavy enough to trip the trap. The mouse just eats the bait right off the trap and never sets it off.I miss the old wood and metal ones! They worked every time and now they are so hard to find!"
1,Zero Stars. Completely useless.,"Let me start by saying, I know how to set a mouse trap. Don't tell me I just don't understand the product.I started by setting the trap, which was simple, I didn't get snapped, and had no trouble at all. I didn't bait it, since you aren't supposed to need to. Nothing happened. In two days I caught nothing.I decided to try a little bait. I spread a bit of peanut butter on the yellow part, making sure to really get it in there so they couldn't just lick it off gently.Nothing happened the first day. The second day it was licked practically clean but had never snapped.I set another one and poked at it with a knife. I banged it, I pushed it, and finally when I PRIED at the yellow thing it finally snapped. No wonder the mice had a nice lunch and nothing more!Totally useless. I finally caught my mouse with a toilet paper roll and a wastebasket."
3,Do not like new design,"The older design with a metal trap must have been considered/tested inferior to this plastic trip design. However, I greatly prefer the older style as being easier to load and set."
1,Does not work,I set up multiple traps where I saw the mouse running. I included some peanut butter. I then watched the mouse run over them multiple times without the trap snapping. The mouse then decided to sit there and eat the peanut butter. They are not sensitive enough to catch the mouse. Go with the metal version (which was not sold at my local grocery store).
3,"works, but gruesome","I tried one of the fancy electronic traps - that gets a mouse every 4 days or so. I wanted faster results, and saw these at the hardware store and thought I'd give it a go.Very simply device, but BRUTALLY hard to set - you either have to set it in place, or be incredibly sensitive when moving it into the nook you want it in. It tripped probably 10 times before I got it into place where I needed it.It caught a mouse the first night I had it out, which is much better than the electronic trap I have set. However, I don't think I'll be using it again - it completely decapitated the mouse, leaving QUITE the mess for me to clean up and deal with. Very effective, but gruesome. Don't mind killing the mice and disposing of them - that's the purpose of this exercise, right? - but having to deal with the mess this mousetrap made is too much. Thank goodness it was in my garage and not my kitchen."
3,"Works, but there are better options...","I was a successful user of these traps for years. We live on a farm and unfortunately, every winter we have the same battle with mice. They were generally successful, but we would have the occasional trap go missing or sprung with no culprit, or grossest of all, find a live mouse trapped. Recently I felt the traps have taken a turn for the worse and have become less sensitive, as we are finding more traps licked clean but not sprung. I have found the solution! Although a little more expensive ($5.25 on Amazon or $3.95 at Home Depot for a 2 pack) the Ortho Home Defense MAX Press and Set traps are as lethal as they look and worth every penny! You'll eventually get your mouse with these, but there are better options on the market."
1,These Victor (and cheaper brands) are crappy,"I had some of these from a few years ago, used cheese as bait (I was using the old type without the fake cheese) They take the bait, set-off the trap and escape. There IS a great mousetrap made by Ortho. Bait it, cock it and place it. I think they are about $2.50 or more each but your nerves and fingers will thank you.As far as ""artificial cheese"", It seems a bit silly and prone to error. Peanut butter, heated on the standard bait holder works great. Heat with a lighter until peanut butter hardens...but take my advice and look at the Ortho traps. They kill quickly, little to no pain for the animal. I hate killing them, honestly. They aren't so different from us..."
1,USELESS!!!,Bought 4 and all four were NOT successful. The ONLY thing worse than having a mouse in your pantry is walking in after a bunch of traps go off to a see all 4 baits gone and the traps EMPTY! Unbelievably useless. How does this company stay in business with no 'repeat' customers. What's equally as frustrating is how HARD these were to SET! It took my husband about 20min to set 4 traps. What a waste of money and time :-(
1,Worst Mouse Trap Ever,There are tons of reviews that tel how to set properly and I still find the cheese platform is too slick to catch the wire. the only way I can set it is about 45 degree angle then it wont fire. Im going back to the old wire catch traps cause this one sucks!
5,WORKED FIRST NIGHT!,I bought about 10 of these from our local hardware store after another more expensive brand did not work. With the other brand the mouse took the bait and was not trapped. I put just a very light coating of peanut butter on the cheese pad and set it out. That very same evening we had the mouse. Will be going to the store to buy more. I do like that the mouse only needs to step on the edge of this pad for it to go off. Some people have complained that they are sensitive but I think that is a good thing. If you follow the instructions and set it down carefully it works fine.
1,Horrible...Buy the J T Eaton traps instead,"These traps are virtually impossible to set. Therefore a total waste of your money and effort. One star is way too high. However the equivalent traps made by J T Eaton, also available on Amazon, are great. Eaton's set the first time, all the time. Trust me, I live in a very old house in the northeast, unfortunately get a lot of mice in the winter in my attics and have had a great deal of experience over years with Victor and recently Eaton. BUY THE EATON traps."
1,"Piece of junk, don't waste your money",These things will not set. The bar connects to a cheap piece of plastic that is so slick the bar slides right off. Tried to set all 4 from the package and not a single one would stay set.
5,"Got mice, get these traps",I have caught so many mice with these things. Once you get a few you keep getting them until you can find the hole they are getting in from the outside. Well I found a hole so I set the traps all around it and caught some 12 of them. Used peanut butter and put the traps in the rafters in the unfinished side of my basement. Left them set over the winter and all summer. Actually caught 1 more many months later. It was pregnant. Still have 4 set and baited in rafters. I hope to never catch anymore. Plugged every possible hole and crack I could find with insulation foam.
1,"Easy to set, 0 for 6 so far on mice","Peanut butter continues to disappear, and the trap remains set. bottom line is that the trap isn't sensitive enough to catch mice. back to the good ole fashioned ones."
1,mouse smarter than trap,i guess victor went cheapo and started to use a plastic trip mechanism rather than the 100 year old tried and true metal one... the plastic doesn't trip properly... my mouse is smarter than victor...s/he ate the peanut butter and got away scott free...
1,Plastic crap trap,"After almost breaking my fingers trying to set bar ( it kept sliding out of window and snapping )I finally set it and re-set it three times (as soon as you set it down it snaps,even on firm setting.DANGER:KEEP YOUR FINGERS CLEAR OR YOU'LL LOOSE THEM ) only to find out that my mice are not that stupid to eat piece of plastic until I put peanut butter on it.Ever see peanut butter fly?Just put some on this trap and set it in place.As soon as you set it down,it snaps and peanut butter flies.Keep your face out of way.Don't waste your money on this junk.Want to catch mice safely?Buy their metal snap trap,put some peanut butter on it and collect dead mice.I am just surprised that they are allowed to sell such dangerous product."
1,"If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It!","I have used these Victor mousetraps over the years. It used to be a simple device, with a metal trap, metal bar to hold it in place on the little metal plate where the device was latched and the bait placed. I was shopping for a mousetrap and saw the familiar Victor name on a pack of two mousetraps. Instead of the metal bait/latching area, there is now a yellow plastic thing in place which is very hard to latch. It took to me about 20 attempts to get it latched properly and I came close to snapping the trap on my own fingers. This is more trouble than it's worth. Probably the company found it cheaper to use plastic for the bait/latching area instead of metal. I will never buy this mousetrap brand again. Hey, Victor Mousetraps: If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
1,They don't catch the mice!,"Thanks to these traps, the mice in my barn are now well-trained to avoid traps in general. I don't have any trouble setting the traps, and they go off with enough force to flip them across the hay stall--but they never catch the mouse. I haven't had this issue with any other kind of basic spring trap."
1,Worse than Worthless,"I tried setting eight traps about thirty times. Not exactly ""Easy-Set"" in any way. I'm sitting here very angry, smelling of the peanut butter that got flung all over me when the traps inevitably went off in my hands, and with hurt fingers from trying to set these pieces of junk into place.Buy a cat, set poison, get more expensive traps. You'll be much less frustrated."
1,Do not buy,These traps are so cheaply made half of them would not even set and the ones that did started falling apare within a week.
2,...and they got away,"Okay, I live in the country so I get mice when the cold weather hits...I put these in the basement and caught a couple after spending a frustrating time of setting them. I thought it was me until I read other people had a hard time too...they snap sooooo easy and are difficult to get them just right. I say they work 1 out of 4 times or so. The mouse gets a treat and the trap is either set or snapped. I had one 'get away' injured...didn't kill him. I'm getting the electronic one and the old fashion snap traps. My cat tells me the cellar is all clear for now."
1,To hard to set!,I have bruised fingers from trying to set them. Then I would gently put them on the floor and they would trip as I walked away! DO NOT BUY!!!!!
2,ultra intelligent mouse? or worthless trap...,"Two nights in a row my resident mouse (or as I know refer to him ""The Brain"") has eaten the peanut butter and gotten away without tripping that trap. I gave it two stars because unlike other reviewers I didn't have problems setting the traps."
1,"Horrible, dangerous",The review by S. Diamond is right on. The traps are extremely frustrating to set and will trigger many times in you hand before the tenstion bar will engage with the plastic paddle. If you are not careful you can get your finger trapped. I've had to throw some away because I could never get the tension bar to stay engaged. Also the cheese paddle does not attract mice. Only when I put some cheese on the paddle are mice attracted and about 1/3 of the time the mouse gets the cheese without triggering the trap.
1,Poor design,"Agree with a previous review about the poor design, specifically on the plastic petal. The plastic petal cannot support enough weight (of cheese or whatever bait) without losing it's tension on the locking bar and releasing the bow. Unless you're very patient with lots of time on your hands, don't buy this trap."
1,Do Not Buy!!,"A better mousetrap???? I think not. The things would not set or stay set by the time I tried to set it in place. One of them the problem was that the catch was too far from the end of the arm and would not even secure. They were bought at WalMart and the receipt thrown out, so $$ is lost. Progress has consequences. Not good!"
5,Great car seat!!!,"I was able to install this car seat rear facing with no problems (my son is about 20 lbs now) and have been using it for about a month now. He falls asleep on it right away and it does not leave his back all sweaty, as his old infant seat used to.I have not used it to travel yet, but will be in about 3 weeks. Tried folding it already and it is rewally easy. I did buy the extra carring strap though (seat comes with one and if you buy a second one you can carry it as a backpack). I really recommend the second strap as this seat is quite heavy."
4,A Great Buy,"The reason I gave this four instead of five stars is that it is heavy and takes up a bit more space than I thought it would when used in the rear facing position. Despite those drawbacks, I would recommend this carseat to a friend and would buy it again for myself if I needed to. I like the streamlined nature of it (other passengers can sit comfortably in my backseat with the carseat installed). Also, my son is large for his age (he looks like a six month old, but he's three months) and he often overheated in his infant carrier. This car seat has enough room for him to ride comfortably and he has not once overheated since we've been using it, which is wonderful considering we live in a dessert. We've had the carseat for nearly a month now and he seems much more relaxed riding in the car (his head stays well supported when he falls asleep - no more chin to chest napping) which makes running errands a lot less stressful. I think this car seat is well worth the money."
4,Sturdy car seat,"I purchased this product for my son, he was previously in a graco infant car seat which he couldnt stand being in. The visibility is better in this one. If I had known earlier, I would have started him in this convertible one."
4,Good Seat,This is a great seat for the purpose we got it for. My husband drives a huge F250 and that is our main car so we have a Britax car seat for that car. My car is a Jeep Grand Cherokee and I didnt feel that the Britax would work as well becuase it is so big. I wanted to fit others in the backseat if I had to. It is very low to the seat which is interesting. The material is great and straps are easy to work with and it is easily put together and removed from car. My only complaint is that is doesnt recline at all so napping doesnt look very comfortable. We dont use my care nearly as much as my husbands so it is ok.
4,NOT for SMALL cars as rearfacing,"This car seat is good in terms of safety and functionality. However, its compatibility up to 80lb passenger cause problem on the other hand. Its size, specificity the length of its back, it so long that, when install as rear facing, its top will lay on the back of the front seat, which is not recommended and dangerous. The solution involves moving your front seat forward, which will make the front space smaller. I do need to move forward A LOT to get enough space for it, and I know I will need to bear this uncomfortable for a year until it convert to front facing."
4,Sunshine Kids Radian 80,[...]This is a great car seat. The only issue is that is can be difficult to install in some vehicles but I believe that the quality of build and safety override that issue. It is much more difficult to install in rear facing mode; not bad in front facing mode. Make sure to always use the tether in either mode - it really helps to tighten up the install.
5,Twins and an older child...,"My wife and I decided on this carseat after much careful research. We decided that for our family of 5 this would be a good fit. I am happy that we did. We have also purchsed the Britax Marathons for Grammy's car and used them for a little while until the Radian 80's arrived. While the Britax carseats fit just fine in the car, i felt that my seven year was a little mashed with the twins flanking him on either side. Once we installed the Radians (which wasn't all that difficult), we put all the kids in, and he seemed to have a little more breathing room with the slimmer profile. Truly, it is not as user friendly as the Britax (we haven't used any others, so I can't comment on other brands), with somewhat difficult straps and slightly complicated install, we are very pleased with the result and are extremely happy that our children are safe."
3,"Works great, when it works","Everything about the shipping process was great. TV arrived, worked great. And then, well, boom. The first 24 hours it got very flaky - every 30 or 45 minutes, the communication between the remote & the TV dies, and the power button gets mapped to 'volume down'. It's toned down in terms of frequency and I have a repair person coming, but still, bleh.However, when it *is* working, it is amazing for the price I paid (875ish)edit: Turned out there was a loose connection. Took the repair folks (Sascoa) just a few minutes to figure it out, and its been perfect ever since."
5,Worth Every Penny!,"I purchased the HL-T5075 and let me tell you it was a great expirence!! The ordering process, shipping and delivery was flawless! My TV arrived well before the estimated delivery date given and WHAT A PICTURE!! I went with the 720p for a couple of reasons. 1. Price - You simply cannot beat the quality this set delivers for the price point. 2. Everything is being broadcast at 720p or 1080i. The only thing actually delivering a full 1080p is Blu-Ray and HD-DVD. I haven't decided what type of player I'm getting until the format war is over. I loved the picture so much with HD broadcasts, that I had to run out and get an up-convert DVD player because I couldn't stand watching my movies from my standard player. I cannot say enough good things about this TV and will be purchasing a lot more products from Amazon!!"
2,Turns off by itself,"After owning 1 1/2 years, it started turning itself off (not coming back on). Bought the extended warranty, so I should be good. But it is a hassle to give up the TV to a repair shop for over a week when the TV is practically new. It was a bit disheartening to have to send a $2000 TV to the repair shop in less than 2 years. I won't buy this kind of TV again."
1,Turns off randomly alot after owning for a month,The unit has a terrible picture even with a HD source and has begun to turn itself off randomly up to 20 times a day. Plan no contacting Samsung Monday but am concerned after reading several sites with same unit and no help at all was given to the people by Samsung. I really wish i had not blown my money on this lemon!!!
5,"My set is perfect, fortunately.","I have had a similar 50"" Samsung DLP HDTV set for two years. It cost me $3,000 and was a good price at that time. I bought an extended warrantee because I wanted to take no chances. I haven't needed the warrantee or any kind of service. It was a little challenging learning about the set's adjustments, but I expected, and got, the best picture I ever imagined! The only picture problems I have had were the fault of the cable company, e.g., low signal strength or poor connections within the cable box, and not the T.V. I would get another one of these in a second, but I would put it through it's paces immediately, and if it weren't perfect, I would return it! And it's lightweight... I got a stand for it at Walmart for $69 that works fine. I'd say buy one, but make sure your particular set is working right and make sure you can return it if it isn't!"
3,Review,"Easy to read, but does not have much factual information. Frequentlyasks the reader to refer to instructions that came with the computer, butmaybe it does make it a little easier to read those instructions."
4,Somewhat helpful but not terribly technical,"This book is helpful for basic computer issues and gives the reader an idea of what to do in the event of routine problems. It does not go into significant detail on troubleshooting and repairing major hardware and software problems. It is primarily a general guide on how to address computer problems such as crashes, freezes, battery and power issues and other such glitches. If one wants to do indepth and complex repairs, he should invest in a technical manual for the specific computer owned."
4,This is the album that introduced me to RB,"I knew who Henry Rollins was and had even seen Rollins Band at Lollapalooza 1 but had never actually listened to a song or album that I could recall. I picked this up used and it just blew me away. Great lyrics, bluesy swing.....it all just flat out worked. I own every RB album now and this one is right up there with Weight and Lifetime in my opinion. Ignore the critics reviews, get this album."
5,Indie Bible a Hit on MKOC.com,"I showcase the Indie Bible on my website, mkoc.com, where I promote independant country music artists. The book has been the largest selling item on the site. Aside from getting all the great information that the book supplies, Dave continues to research and send out updates to all who have purchased the book. Dave is a true advocate of the independant artists and works constantly to find more ways enhance their career and make thier life easier.This book is a must for any indie artist!MarliMy Kind of Countrymkoc.com"
2,Not that great a resource; Good for mostly internet only,"This book has almost NO ADDRESSES or PHONE NUMBERS or FAX NUMBERS. So unless you have an unlimited amount of time to go to all the web sites it lists and get the info, it's not much good. The purpose of a resource book like this should be to give you contact information and save you time. This book does neither.EXAMPLES:Under ""Reviewers of Independant Music"":Atomic Chaserhttp://www.geocities.com/atomicchaserUnder ""Radio Stations that are willing to Play Independant Music"":WRVU Vanderbilt Universityhttp://wrvu.orgGet the drift? Unless you go to the thousands of web sites and get the info, you don't know what the addresses, phone numbers, or contact names are. And if you download the book and print it out yourself, you have 654 full size pages! That is too huge for my biggest binding clips!..."
4,Good Set,"I have always had good luck with Milwaukee tools. This is a good set, but I expected better construction from Milwaukee. The fine adjustment isn't very percise and the above table adjustment on the base has a plastic stud that doesn't exactly fit the wrench. I can tell the plastic won't last long, it came marred from the factory where they forced the wrench on. I don't understand why they would build such a great tool and then put plastic in places that it shouldn't be. ...just charge me a few pennys more and use metal! The plunge is very smooth and the router is easy to change from base to base."
2,Not for precision work,"First of all, do not trust the depth stop lock screw on the plunge base! It will vibrate loose, and you'll end up plunging too deep and possibly ruin your workpiece.Second, it is too time consuming to set the depth stop accurately. With the lock screw loose, there is almost 1/8"" of play in the mechanism, so the fine adjustment knob is almost useless.Third, the centering cone is plastic and junky, it wobbles and will not center the base accurately.Other than the plunge base the router is fine (although I haven't tried it in a table yet). But I bought this for precision plunge routing, and I'm disappointed."
4,"Good fixed base,stiff plunge base","I purchased this router combo in april to supplement my milwaukee table mounted router. First, the durable plastic case is large and everything fits inside nicely. The compact fixed base is comfortable and will be familiar to those who have used other milwaukee body grip routers. The plunge base feels robust but the plunge lever is very stiff. I thought that it may loosen after some usage, and it did improve gradually, but it made routing deep mortises a chore. Make no mistake, it works, it is just very stiff. Another issue involved the two milwaukee supplied 1 1/8 wrenches. One of the wrenches was forged incorrectly and would not fit on the collet. After a phone call to Milwaukee, a new wrench arrived a few days later. I gave this router 4 stars because it is powerful, has a excellent fixed base, decent plunge base, and a solid 5 year warranty."
4,Great Router,"Purchased the Milwaukee 5616-24 Router to replace my old Black & Decker. I works very smooth and surprisingly quiet for how big it is. It's larger and heavier than the B&D; but the ergonomics feels better. I'll still use my B&D; for small jobs.I haven't used the plunge stand yet but thought it was a good idea to have for future projects. The case it comes in is massive and a bit of a waste for me. I incorporated every thing into one of my shop drawers for easy access. I can see if your using it on a job site it would be handy but for most folks it goes into the shop and the case goes to the attic. It would be nice to offer it as an accessory and save a few bucks off the price.I saved big buying this from Amazon, they wanted $60 more at the local home centers around here."
3,Sway Pro not made for some vehicles,"I purchased the Blue Ox Swaypro Hitch after reading raving reviews about its performance. I followed the instructions to the 'T'. I have a 2007 Suburban with the receiver hitch mounted in the bumper and found that even installed at its lowest on the receiver bar it is 4 to 5"" too high."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this novel when I saw that my favorite author, Harlan Coben, found it to be ""a powerhouse of a thriller"". His recommendation was all I needed to pick up the book. However, after reading ""Every Step You Take"", all I can say is that Coben may be a brilliant author, but when it comes to reviewing novels, he is far too generous.This novel was not worth the work it took to read. There were so many subplots mixed in that all I was left with was a flurry of inconsequential characters to muddle through. Although the character of murderer B.B. Lebeau had the potential to be fascinating, the author never fully developed this.This novel continuously hinted at there being more to its plot, but never reached its potential. The ending was especially unsatisfactory, as it was implausible and even ridiculous. Motives given for crimes committed were weak and absurd.This novel was, unfortunately, a letdown."
1,Ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Please tell me the major plot line for this book is actually in this book somewhere! I'm on page 158 and they have hardly mentioned it! And people keep getting murdered but no one mentions it afterwards! ""Oh,theres money missing from my account? Oh well its the weekend I'll take care of it later!"" Everyone assumes the bad guy is the cause of all evil, no exploration of who else may be at fault,or who or why. I don't know about anyone else but I personally like suspense/murder/mystery books that actually talk about the people who are murdered and try to figure out why. I would throw this book away if I hadn't paid full price for it. I would never read this author again and I know this only half way thru the book! Please tell me the rest of this book explains all the quirks of the characters I don't even care about! Please tell me they talk about the murders and explore other options instead of just going in one direction."
3,"Could,ve been a contender!","Claire Barrow is trying to please her demanding editor with a new book proposal, so she details her own chaotic life. She is constantly battling with her stepdaughter and trying to stem the theft of her credit accounts while learning to live with the grief of being a new widow whose husband suicided. All a good premise for a gripping novel... Lots of potentially fascinating characters appear and just as quickly disappear, never to be heard of again. The villain of the piece is so evil and deranged that NO court in any land would release him under any circumstances and the ending reads as if an enthusiastic 10 year old wrote the final scene of a pantomime. I just can't understand why such a usually good writer went beserk!"
1,Pass on this one!!,"This is the first and last book by this author I have read. This is without a doubt the worst book I have read in years and I read a lot. While the premise of identity theft is both interesting and contemporary, the execution is awful. Filled with trite phrases, pointless wordiness, and characters without character, Every Step You Take is simply a painful and unrewarding read. Pick a book at random and you are practically guaranteed to be better off. How Kelman became a bestselling author and winner of some sort of award is incomprehensible. Pass...Pass...Pass.."
5,LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!,"I loved this book!! It was fast-paced and suspenseful from cover to cover. I've read all of Kelman's books and she never fails to grab my interest right from the first page. I especially love the forensic group, the Arcanum.I can't wait for Kelman's next book!!!"
1,Good premise that rapidly goes south,"There was way too much going on in this overplotted mess-- as another reviewer wrote, characters and incidents are thrown in and nothing becomes of them. They're not so much ""red herrings"" which have a use in a good thriller, but irrelevant points the author meant to use and seemingly forgot about. The ending is ridiculous and by then I hated all the characters so much I just didn't care. This is the first book I have read by this author and I'm pretty sure it will be the last."
1,Suspense going nowhere fast,"I usually like Judith Kelman but after reading this book I doubt I will read her again. The book was slow, and as others have written, too many characters and plots going nowhere, and the ending was so contrived I felt the author was like her lead character in that she couldn't come up with an ending so she made up one of the worst nonsensical ones I have ever had the misfortune to read. Most of the time I wanted to just put the book down and say ""forget it"" but since I paid for it I kept going. For those of you who are looking for a good suspense novel with a great ending don't bother. Personally I think Judith Kelman should be ashamed of herself for putting us through 300 pages just to make up such an unbelievable book!"
1,"well, folks...","3 September 2010: just saw a screening of Amir bar-Lev's documentary. Creeps like golf-groupie Mike Towle have long since cashed in on Tillman and moved on. Still, watch for Towle's next project."
1,Update this book!,This book needs to be updated with the sorry story of the abuse of a dead football player for propaganda purposes by an incompetent military and an administration bereft of any sense of decency or notion of ethical behaviour.
1,apparently I am not alone,"They made a new listing for this case (how could I be the first to say it sucks?). MY PHONE IS SHATTERED. great protective case, as long as you never drop it."
3,It's Okay...,"I thought that it fits a bit too tight on the top (screen portion of the phone). Hard time getting it on. Also, this WILL NOT fit if you have an extended life battery."
4,User friendly,"User friendly road atlas. You get a lot of information for the price and its just the right size. I love the sprial binding, that makes it easy to change pages."
5,great single!!,i was waiting for a great freestyle song to come out. amy tori sounds great. all the mixes on this cd has got me moving in every direction. love you amy tori!
5,It's about time,"This is the most well-written, comprehensive, and lucid survey of African art available to date. I am using it as the primary text for my introduction to African art at both Princeton University and York College, CUNY and expect my students to come away with a valuable reference text that will not become outdated to quickly."
3,Interesting book....,This book was required for an art history class that I took. It was interesting but I found some incorrect facts after I did more research. The history of African art is almost too large to fit into one but this book does give a good foundation.
2,Not interctive with kindle Keyboard,Unless it is that I am doing something wrong I cannot get this dictionary to function like others I have on my kindle. It does not respond to the Kindle keyboard by listing the nearest words as I enter my target word. Instead I have to go to 'find' and then I get a confusing array of definitions. Tedious.
2,No Table of Contents or Navigation for Kindle,"This review is specific to the Kindle version... A fine dictionary, but a disappointment on Kindle. It is essential for Reference works on the Kindle to provide easy navigation. With this implementation you will be limited to default Search options.That is not to fault the extensive coverage, scope and usage guidance provided but, as I was looking for a quick reference for gaps in my vocabulary, No Navigation = Difficult to Use."
2,good for starters,"This is a basic - very basic - Irish-English dictionary.A good starting point, but not as thorough as I would have liked it to be."
3,A nice departure from my typical listening habits,"I like to keep my music varied.Island Life is the equivalent of a pair of shoes I don't wear often. When I do wear them, however, I'm in a different state of mind. I bought this album while in Baghdad in 2006. I'm still listening occasionally to re-capture some of those bittersweet moments.If you like your music with Cuban flavor Island Life will satisfy."
2,Island life must be pretty boring...,"I bought this CD based on other reviews but after listening to it, I thought it was pretty suckky and it is too late to get my money back. there seems to be at least 4 tracks that sound decent enough. songs are mostly bilingual and sang using both words.Maybe at a party the CD would be allright because people are talking, drinking, making out, and thinking about a lot of other things than specifically the music. In the background, it sounds okay. but when it's you and the stereo, in the truck, on the way to work and your major attention is put on the music, Island Life just doesn't cut it. $17 bucks wasted"
4,Attitude of Gratitude,The chapters were very inspiriing and had me start a gratitude journal. It made me think about being more grateful for what I do have and not feel so bad for what I don't have. It was also a very good calming book to read.
5,So worried of what is to come of this Title,"I have personal knowledge that a convicted Rapist, Attempted Murderer is going to be selling a DVD called.....Attitude to Gratitude. Very concerned this will be mixed up with you beautiful BOOKS!"
5,Fantastic! - Attitudes of Gratitue,"This was a Fantastic! book. I found it very uplifting and quite an eye opener.For anyone looking for inspiration in their life this is the book to read.It was one of those books that made you stop, think and look at yourself on how you areliving life. I would highly recommend this book."
3,Could Have Been Much Better,"Yes the recordings are as good as the other reviewers say they are. However a couple of nits:1. The recordings run into one another. Not having listened to these works for many years, several times it took me a bit to realize that one had ended and I was now listening to another masterpiece. A little breathing room between pieces or even a quick title announcement would have been appreciated.2. There is no listing of what is on what disk on either the box or the CD holder insert. That means you have to use the paper insert to find what you want or scan the tiny silver font on green disk labels. Unfortunately my insert was missing. It would have been so much nicer to have the play list printed on the cd holder where it would be handy whenever I pulled one out."
2,False Advertising (NOT UNABRIDGED),"This product is advertised as ""UNABRIDGED poems and stories,"" and both the front and back of the CD box displays the word ""unabridged,"" but it's not unabridged.I bought this Caedmon product to supplement my Literature class, because I wanted to teach my students to ""hear"" short stories and novels. Since I've purchased several excellent quality Shakespeare plays from Caedmon(all of which followed the text of the Riverside Shakespeare exactly), I decided to buy this collection.Alas! One only has to listen to the first three paragraphs of ""The Cask of Amontillado"" to realize that several sentences have been OMITTED (about 10 sentences from the entire story).Price and Rathbone do an excellent job with the EDITED material, and that saddens me, because I can imagine what they could have done with the unabridged text."
3,Not for the hard of hearing,"The content of the collection is excellent, 5-star quality narration of Poe's works, with excellent sound quality. You better have a kickin' amp in your stereo, though, because the recording level is uneven, and gets so low that I could barely make some stories out with my car stereo maxed. Great collection, just expect to have to rip/burn it at a much higher volume to actually hear it."
3,No Track Listing,"I'd used this version of Poe stories for my high school class through our school library, and I really like the Basil Rathbone/Vincent Price versions, so I decided to order my own copy as the library one was getting old. However, the version I received does not tell you which stories are on which CD - not on the CDs themselves or on an insert, so I'm going to have to listen through all of them and then mark them myself - BUMMER. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this version."
3,maybe for the fan,"I'm didn't like the audio levels, I had to turn it up to hear some of what the narrators were saying, but then other times it would be too loud."
2,disappointed,"I love Edgar Allan Poe and I thought it would be extra spooky and fun to have the likes of Price and Rathbone, but they did not captivate me at all. I would rather read my book than listen to this collection. It is now sitting on a shelf untouched after one run through - bummer."
1,beware not unabridged !!!,The cd is touted as unabridged but it isn't!! These are short stories...Poe reworked them to make them leaner and ever shorter at the end of his life...and they found a way to cut him!!!
2,Audio bad,The audio one minute is really low and the next minute it gets really loud. Narration is not great either.
3,Missing Some Important Tales,"I was surprised and extremely disappointed to find that this collection omits ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue,"" ""The Mystery of Marie Roget,"" and ""The Purloined Letter."" Quite an omission, since these are significant works and the only tales in which Poe's detective, Auguste Dupin -- the precursor of Sherlock Holmes and countless other detectives -- appears. If those stories are important to you, look elsewhere."
2,Not for the Hearing Impaired,"Not for the hearing unimpaired either. This CD is gutless. It has no volume, no amplitude, no power. To use it in my junior classes, I had to place an ampflifier mike at one of the speakers of the CD player I was using. I never had to do this before, and I've played plenty of audio CDs in class. Surf the web for free downloads instead of paying for this dog. I highly recommend ""The Cask of Amontillado"" as read by Norman George and ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" as read by talk-radio host Glenn Beck. The latter has sound effects and, when I played it (sans amp) in class, Beck kept the kiddies rapt until the grisly end."
1,phooey,"Audiobooks are books meant to be read aloud, enunciation and clarity are among the most important.Using these very old recordings done for a 'dramatic appeal' has left me with a feeling of wanton waste of money.Basil Rathbone's renditions are from a Shakespearean attempting to do Poe. If he would simply read. Alas, he acts, not reads.All of his recordings are: Volume too low, adjust up, volume to high, adjust down, yelling, adjust down again, whispering, adjust up again, etc. etc. ad nauseum. One cannot possibly hear using one setting of volume.It is a waste of money. Find a human who can read it and enunciate and let me do the fantasizing and imagining and conjuring. The poetry and prose should stand up alone and by itself, not acted upon. Rathbone died in 1967. The recording is over 50 years old!!Anyone who needs it play acted is not getting the correct message. It's about the words, not the actor."
2,Poe - Great Reading - Horrible Editors,"Stories and Poems - These are classics and therefore my reviewing is pointless.Readers - Mr. Price and Mr. Rathbone were excellent as readers; in some cases, they gave performances better than their movies allowed them to show their range of skills.Editors - This is the worst editing job I have listen to in all the audiobooks I purchased. No introductions and disk information. There was no preface or other supplemental information. The publisher just slapped the recordings into on CDs. The sound quality, volume, was poor as well. Horrible waste of great talent. Buy Poe, with Price and Rathbone as readers. Do not buy from this publisher."
5,Much more economical than new phone,Replacing the battery on my old phone was much cheaper than buying a new phone. It charges pretty quickly and holds a charge for a long time. Buying it was much more convenient than having to change phones.
3,The Bill Collector,"Christian World View...well I guess. Schmarmy acting....well, I guess. The ""hero"" is NOT at all sympathetic and in fact I just didn't like him. Way too much manipulation going on in just about everything he does. The villian I liked better as he was true to form and predictable. The hero, I kept waiting for him to do something good for the sake of doing good..... I'm still waiting....This flick does show us what we can get ourselves into when we leave the Lord out of the equation.If I'd known more how the ""hero"" scharmed his way through the movie...I'd never bought it."
5,Great new for fans of films like CTHD and Hero,"The first official English translation of a novel by the most popular modern writer of ""wuxia"" (Chinese swordplay) fiction. This one is the source novel of a classic Shaw Brothers movie starring Ti Lung, ""Swordsman & Enchantress."" It's a lively and readable translation and a fine piece of bookmaking. Congratulations to everyone involved!"
3,Good translated work,"There are not too many English translated work of Chinese novels, especially books in the Chinese martial art genre. From a translation perspective, this is a good one. But from a story perspective, I did not like it as much. There is not too much details in the fighting scenes, just summary of it. The focus seems to be more of a relationship between the 2 main characters. Also, the ending is anticlimatic. I was a bit disappointed with the build up and then it just ends with little hint of what eventually happened. It seems like a unfinished story and definitely left room for a sequel of some kind."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this TV directly from Panasonic. Got a great deal, the picture is sharp although there is some shadowing I can't get rid of completely.I would not recommend this TV however. I have owned my TV for 11 weeks and it has not worked for 6 weeks of that time. It has spent more time being repaired than it has working. The TV has had multiple failures and Panasonic refuses to replace it. They want to continue fixing my current, obviously seriously flawed TV. At a very slow pace might I add. Panasonic customer service has been horrible, I would not recommend this TV or any Panasonic TV to anyone."
2,Not as reliable as my other Panasonic experiences,"I bought this Panasonic a few years ago before LCD's and plasma's dropped in price. I specifically shopped for Panasonic because I like the brand and was always happy with whatever Panasonic product I bought. Today I wouldn't recommend this model because: (1) I' ve had to have it serviced twice--my previous Panasonic lasted nearly 20 years with ZERO repairs. Both times the parts were under $5.00 but home service and labor cost me more than $230 bucks; and (2) It's a beast, weighing over 100 pounds and very bulky. Why buy a monster like this when you can buy and tote home an LCD under your arm?! And, of course, if you need an LCD or plasma repaired, you can carry it in yourself. So it looks like next time this TV craps out (as I'm sure it will), I'll be looking for a different brand."
4,Good Tv but don't buy from amazon,The picture quality of this TV is excellent and the tv is cheaper compared to the similar version of Sony. I bought the first same TV from circuit city and bought the second one from amazon.It has been 10 days and amazon has not shipped my order.
3,A little hard to absorb,"This book teaches about high performance engines by presenting case studies which are actually taken from SAE papers. Due to the style of writing used, it is a little hard to absorb. I find myself having to reiterate many of the sections to understand the concepts completely. I prefer reading texts that get to the point more quickly. I know that many of the concepts presented are interrelated, but there is little attempt to relate them. Many of the illustrations and graphics are not printed clearly (some graphs are not readable). It does present a fair amount of information that is useful, its just a little hard to extract."
1,great game.....poorest quality,One of the best games ever played deserves to be reproduced to HD quality not this garbage that i cannot even watch.
1,Poor Video Quality,Do not order this DVD. I'm appalled at the poor quality of this DVD. It is unwatchable. Everything is blocky and pixelated. The video seems to lag constantly making it seem like the entire game is in slow motion.
5,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL CALENDAR,i have bought this calendar for the last five years and it is always a beautiful work of art. it is not only a calendar; it is a lovely piece of art hanging on your wall. the colors are outstanding! a page in the back gives you a history of each painting.
4,Hysterically funny!,"I had a copy of this book in my personal collection, and laughed so much while reading it. I recently bought another copy to give a friend for no reason except that I new she would appreciate it. Especially funny to those of us who love (or hate) songs from the 60's and 70's. It makes a great gift."
2,"Interesting concept, but mercilessly padded","I was given the book for free by a friend. It was a worthwhile read, but the problem with the book is that it's an extraordinarily fast read--I got through it in about an hour. It's effectively a newspaper feature article on the subject, packed out to book length and packaging with a few gimmicky graphics tricks--and six pages of songwriter credits--that pad out additional pages. It also presumes that everyone reading the book is familiar with every song--which may or may not be the case."
3,"A rehash, but a nice way to pass the time.","If you've read Dave's columns on the Bad Song Survey, this book may be a bit of a let-down, since it is largely a rehash of those columns. Nevertheless, there is enough new material here for you to pass an amusing time. A nice book for a long bus ride."
4,A hilariously funny book,"Dave Barry is one of the cleverest men alive. His ability to come up with these funny books is simply amazing. To completely appreciate this book, you should review some old songs from the 60's through the 80's. My personal favorite joke in the book was when he took the song ""Timothy"" and the song ""Yummy, Yummy, Yummy I got love in my Tummy"" and made it ""Yummy, Yummy, Yummy I got Tim in my Tummy (if you know the lyrics to both songs, you would get the joke)"". Or when he took the song ""There Ain't No Woman Like the One I Got"" and made it ""There Ain't no Woman Like the One-eyed Gott."" Well, I don't want to give the whole book away, but those are just a few of the jokes in the book."
4,This was better than Prozac.,"I highly recommend this book to anyone with a severe case of sadness. Dave Barry made an ""unfortunate"" comment about Neil Diamond in his newspaper column, and he got inundated by two types of letters: half of them criticized him for being so wrong about Mr. Diamond, half of them praised him for being so right. Barry then realized that music is a polarizing subject, about which people have very passionate ideas, so he decided to survey his readers on their musical pet peeves. The result is this terrific book. Keep it in mind for those friends with hideous musical taste!"
3,"Great story, wrong style","I read loads of Latin American and Chicano fiction, so I added this to my list since it fit that genre. However, I felt the stylism of the writing really detracted from the fantastic story about a mother's love for her child.While I read the book all in one sitting because the story was so gripping, the author's voice really grated on me, as if he/she were blowing this simple, deeply feeling human story all out of proportion. I won't say the characters were simple, but there's something there that kept me saying, oh please get over yourself.Reading this book for me is like watching a made-for-TV movie because you've already watched everything on HBO."
5,Excellent for World-Themes in the Classroom!,"I have taught a couple of summer schools with PreK and Kindergarten students and we had soooo much fun with many of these songs. The absolute favorite is the first song ""Hello to all the children of the world"", which teaches children to say hello in different languages. We did half sign language, half movement which made it not only fun for the kids, but also for the parents when we sang this song to them. The other favorite songs: ""Brown Girl in the Ring"" and ""Going Over the Sea"". If you are a teacher or even a parent, your kids will LOVE this CD and will learn a little culture in the process."
5,Travelling the World in Our Minivan,"I purchased this cd last week to use as a springboard for studies of other cultures with my kids (ages 8, 5, and 3). It is GREAT!We listen to it in the van and it feels like we are visiting other countries when we're just on our way to the grocery store! The kids love it...even the songs that they don't understand. The songs are introduced by a national in the nation's language. In many cases, these are children. Then the kids translate their introduction into english. The song is then sung in the native language and sung again in english. My eight year old loves reading the native language while it's being sung...and often tries to sing it with them.I am amazed at the translation because I know it took work to find out what these songs mean and how to make it fit musically into english. Very good quality work."
3,Needs to have the full songs,"Got a ""sampler"" of this from a friend and wanted the full package. The book is nice and contains all lyrics but I wanted and expected the full songs on the cd. If it had full songs then it would get 5 stars easy."
2,Crappy Frother,"This machine looks very nice and was built fairly well for the most part, BUT the cappaccino machine needs more steam power for the frother and the rubber piece they have over the froth wand is useless and the machine actually froths better without it. The coffee maker takes forever to brew and the pot and its lid are kind of cheap.I would NOT recommend this machine."
2,Not So Hot,"I found this product to be poorly made and flimsy. The espresso was more bitter than my previous machine and the machine itself clogged easily. I found that coffee of both types made with this machine was just a little funny tasting, perhaps because of the plastic or other materials used in its manufacture.On the good side, the warmer plate for regular coffee was not very hot, but hot enough, allowing the second cup to taste almost the same as the first."
2,Looks can be deceiving,"Wow! Too good to be true would be a correct summation here. It is flimsy and coffee doesn't stay hot. You get what you pay for. But if you are looking for an impressive looking machine for the price - go for it. Sorry, Westbend, but go back to the drawing board. Do more than make it pretty."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"This has got to be the worst coffee machine we have ever had. It is nearly impossible to pour the coffee out of the pot without it spilling all down the side and onto your counter (or hand, whatever) Also, when the coffee brews, it spits and sputters all over the place. We have papertowels underneath our machine and it is staining our countertops.Absolutely terrible."
2,Very disappointing,"This coffee pot has been full of disappointments. The expresso acts more like a drip coffee pot, so you end up with something that resembles strong(er) coffee, but NOT expresso. It is hard to know where to exactly place the expresso carafe so that you don't end up with coffee all over the counter. It is even hard to pour the expresso out without making a mess. The coffee pot takes a long time to brew a pot. The filter basket is hard to swing out. Overall, this is a poorly made machine and the performance is poor. It's products like this that are teaching me that you have to SAVE THE BOX AND RECEIPT for much longer than you think you should have to! I would be willing to pay this price or more if I could only get decent quality. I've VERY disappointed."
1,Don't buy this JUNK,"1.it's JUNK2.its made of very cheap and fragile plastic3.the glass of the pots is very thin4.the stop and serve feature will break withing 2 weeks,5.the filter holder's mount is also very very easy to break6.the espresso works half way decent but its not worth the money8.avoid this peace of ...."
3,Replacable,"I've had this coffee maker since 2006 and it's still running strong... sort of. I say sort of because I remember the first few months I've had it, the piece of the filter holder which held the filter basket broke! Total bummer... I replaced it by going to the Westblend website and walah! New filter holder. Still, I had to pay for that AND shipping & handling so that sucked. And not too long ago the aluminum that held the coffee carafe and the handle together broke! So same story, went to the website, bought a whole new coffee carafe and payed shipping and handling. I guess what I like about this machine is it does do the job and it's affordable. Some also say that it takes a while to get hot but I don't have that problem. I find it to be pretty quick. What I hate about it is, well it broke on me 2 times. I'd say get it if you really want to. It's not a bad machine, I would have rated it lower but because it's easy to replace the parts, I say it's ""okay"" to get."
2,Cheaply made!,"I bought this item from walmart and tested it out and it worked great so i threw out the receipt and the box. A month later the plastic peice has broken off the drip part so now a sping hangs down and its a pain in the butt to get the pot in place. I cant return it (although im gonna try). Ive owned some cheap coffee makers in my life and they seemed to be made better then this expensive one. Plus, the coffee doesnt get very hot. This was just a big disappointment."
2,Bitter tasting,"Initially I really liked this coffee maker. It has all the features to make lattes, etc. and is easy to use. However after a couple of weeks I decided to return it. It does something to the taste of the coffee. I tried making it exactly right, tried changing coffees but it still have a funny bitter taste which I can only assume is from the type of materials used, or the way it creates the coffee. Also had a problem getting hot enough coffee. So not recommended unless you don't care how the coffee tastes (like my husband).However, I have a WestBend kettle which is fantastic so this is not a review against the brand which has does have good products."
2,"The Good Espresso, The Bad Coffee, and The Ugly Mess!","I read these reviews prior to purchasing this item, but went and bought it anyway because I wanted to save money. Well, now I am suffering from the worst coffee I have ever had. The espresso is great, the frother works great, etc. The espresso carafe doesn't sit well and it does splatter all over the place, but I have made some great Cappucinos. As for the coffee side, if you like black coffee, then the temperature will be ok. If you like milk in your coffee, its not hot enough. BUT, the biggest problem is the taste of the coffee. I use the same coffee I used on my Drugstore bought coffee maker, I have also tried freshly ground Starbucks, and still there is a wierd taste and it makes that early morning experience I look forward to...SUCK!! Don't waste the money, spend the extra few bucks for a good one or maybe even two separate systems."
1,Very Poor Quality,"Unfortunately the only combination XM, AM, FM, CD player on the market radiates cheap from the moment you lift it out of the box. It has the feel of one of those happy meal toys rather than a real boombox. The sound quality is poor and I returned mine because the XM antenna connection did not function at all. Hopefully a higher quality manufacturer will seize the market opening for this unique combination device."
3,Good XM/CD/FM/AM Boombox ...... If you plan to leave it in one place.,"I bought this boombox knowing the possible XM antenna jack failure, It did not matter to me because I would not be moving it. If you are wanting a Mobile XM boombox to carry around with you get the Belkin F5X007 for the Roady XT or Audiovox Xpress. THIS IS NOT A ""TRULY"" MOBILE XM BOOMBOX!!With a 50ft xm antenna cord and the jack sticking out so far It;s more a mini-home unit rather than a boombox. But for a simple ALL IN ONE XM/FM/AM/CD boombox ,this is a good radio.PROS,All in one unit (minus the XM antenna add-on)RemoteCD/MP3/WMA playerXM Ready (with Antenna add on)CONS,Fragile XM antenna port (IF MOVING UNIT BE VERY CAREFUL!!)One line display for XM Artist/Song info.No TuneSelectNot very mobile (XM BOOMBOX WISE).CONCLUSION: GOOD BUY IF YOU WANT A ""ALL IN ONE"" XM/CD/FM/AM Unit, Just don't plan on moving this around alot."
1,Buyer beware BIG TIME,"I bought this for my grandmother so that she could either play a long running MP3 I'd made for her of her favorite music or just turn on an XM station and leave it there. It worked great for a week, then the CD player completely shut down, followed days later by the XM connection. Very disappointing."
5,Great Product,"Solgar is a really good brand for certain particular supplements (although not everything). I compared their cinnamon capsules with several other major brands, and Solgar impressed me the most. It's more of a full-spectrum supplement because they include both the raw cinnamon powder (200mg) and a 4 to 1 cinnamon extract (300mg) in each capsule. Also the capsules are made of vegetable cellulose instead of gelatin, and the magnesium stearate is from a vegetable source as well. That's just what I'm looking for in a supplement: no garbage ingredients."
4,"Snip,Snip.............","Her hair is way too long-how asre you ever going to play with her without the risk of wrecking her hair? I've seen this doll in stores and I didn't notice her hair , luckily it shows in the picture cause I nearly brought her!!!!!!!! other than that she is coolAlly"
5,...,"A lot of people think that all Bratz dolls hair is too long, but that just adds to the fun! I mean, you don't really have to keep it that way. And it's not like you can't cut it! But think about when you were younger (around 6-10 years). Didn't you always want the doll with the long hair? Didn't you think it was super pretty? And you knew that doll was gonna be your sparkle princess? Okay, anytways, it's not even hard to take care of (well, it can be, but most dolls you only have to brush their hair about once or twice a month and it looks fine). I think that this is a great doll and looks super fashionable!"
4,Fingerboard Harmony for Bass,"Very good book for the intermediate bassist looking to broaden their bass playing skills from 3 chord rock. I have been playing for two years. Helps you understand fundamentals and may even help you with your creative side if you want to try your hand at writing, or, come up with counter melodies and steal some thunder back from your guitarist.Worth the cost new."
4,Pleased,"I didn't give it a 5 star rating because it failed to provide me with the answers to everything I need to know about bass soloing.No grid method? no answers on how to play at lightning speed?(For humor, please refer to paragraph above.)A simple almost basic understanding of theory is all that is required.He won't show you that. Like most teachers, we all know that all it takes is one bad teacher and the rest of your learning could begin to Domino. Bottom line in my opinion is, this method of learning I understood, but he might not be the choice for you. Everyone learns differently.I found his way of teaching insightful! If you know any of his work, you probably know what to expect."
3,guitargrid dot com is much better,"This entire book can be summed up in the info contained on page 25 and 68-69. Everything else is just exercises for how to build jazz style walking bass lines (as opposed to country or blues walking bass lines). Go to www guitargrid com for a much better system of learning fretboard harmony. I've been playing guitar for 14 years and bass for 9. I have a bachelor's degree in classical guitar performance and have authored a book on how to play bass guitar. I learned more about where the notes are on guitar/bass in an hour with this system than in 4 years of music college. Learn and improvise in all the modes, pentatonic, blues, major & minor scales as well as arpeggios and chords starting on any note anywhere on the neck using about a half dozen easy to memorize patterns. You don't even have to read notation or tab!"
1,did not work for me,i used 2 plugs in the tire of a hummer h2but it did not work i had to have apatch put on the inside
5,Superb performance,"Let me say right off, the subtitles were fine. There may be problems with some copies but certainly not mine. This is not an easy go but the acting singers do a wonderful job on what can be a very difficult score. Frankly, I liked this stark looking production a great deal. It isn't pretty but does it need to be? It keeps the focus on the drama and that's exactly where it should be. As for memorable melodies, there aren't any and I wouldn't expect there to be. This isn't Verdi or Puccini. Personally, I dislike the way the term Euro trash is thrown around. Just because a production is viewed from a different perspective does not mean its trash!"
1,"Doesn't Connect, no tech support","We bought the IC465c to work with Skype. We run XP. The drivers installed, but when we connected the camera, it would not be recognized. Was on hold with tech support for 34 minutes and no answer. Gave up and will return the camera despite the big notice in box that says, 'Do not return to store.'Micro innovations website was not helpful either. Sounds like this company preys on bargain shoppers who they expect will not take the time to return non-working goods. I'll stay away from Micro Innovations from now on."
3,Just OK...,"I was hoping for something that would give more tips about the levels in the game. The book give a good overview of the levels. And it does a good job talking about the enemies you'll encounter, but not enough details about the levels for my liking. It's better than nothing tho..."
3,Why Women?,"Why are there so many books, movies, courses, etc on and on that are for women specifically? You never see a TV channel ""for men"", or psych books ""for men"", etc. It's interesting.The problem of thinking too much is far from just a female problem. So why target women with this book? Why not write a book called ""People Who Think Too Much""? Or ""Do You Think Too Much""? That could be useful for BOTH sexes. And your target audience for selling the book would double!I don't know, maybe you don't like men or feel men have subjegated you so you are a feminist and don't want to write for or sell to men. Curious.Me? I think way too much. It's killing me! I wonder if there's a book out there about this for men, or for people in general."
5,Awesome!,"Great for everyone, it really makes you think so much about how to change your thought process and your life. It also has a lot of empathy in it and not judgment passing."
3,not bad,this book is not bad. i wish if it was sorted into small parts for easy reading. but its informative and well explained.
3,Seems suited for a classroom,"I was excited about the title of this book, being a chronic overthinker, and although I got a few nuggets, I felt that the research-driven style would be best suitable for a psychology class than for personal reading. Also, the examples and stories are detailed and plentiful - got me thinking too much about those people and their issues. I would have preferred a more edited down version."
4,"Good read, informative","''This book would be good for any woman to read, not just those who overthink. I like the personal stories be because they give you a really good example of what overthinking looks like and ways to change your habits. This will be a good tool for anyone to use in dealing with life and all it's choices"
3,Overthinkers,"This book is for people who think to much what they did ( past). I'm more the kind that thinks to much what to do (future).I got a little confused, and the book was not quite for me. But it is a good book to read."
4,Women Who Think Too Much,I haven't finished this book yet but so far it's good. Some of the information is common knowledge and I'm looking forward to reading more and getting additional info.
4,good for any age,My nephews (both 6) enjoy looking out the window at all the birds in the feeder. The clear information helps us identify birds together. Great pictures and good information. The only thing lacking is info on diet.
5,A Sibley classic,"A truly magnificent book, which, coupled with its companion volume, the Sibley Guide to Bird Life and Behavior, provides the definitive text on American birdlife."
4,The Sibley Guide to Birds: Field Identification,"This rating should actually be a four and a half, the only drawback on the wonderful book is it is to large for a field guide. With this book you will have no doubt in identifying your bird. Have fun."
4,Sibley Guide to Birds,"First of all, the book arrived in due time and was in the shape they said it would be. I have good knowledge of many birds, but this one has such fine and detailed drawings of all the birds he describes in the book. I find his descriptions of the sounds birds make to be rather amusing, even if most of the time futile, in their attempts to let one know how a bird sounds. It would be nice if an edition of this book could come out with a 'true to life' audio version of bird calls. Maybe there already is one, I don't know. It's a great book, nevertheless. It's definetely been a help to me with identification."
4,Sibley's Guide to Birds,"We keep this book on our porch right next to our binoculars. We find the birds we are trying to identify very quickly and easily. It's a very good reference book for our purposes. It is much more definitive than the The Golden Press, A Guide to Field Identification: Birds of North America."
4,The bible for all serious birders,"This is the most complete book on identifying birds by sight and sound that exists. Regional and age-based plumage variations are all illustrated, as are hybrids. Important features are highlighted, flight patterns are shown. The birds are illustrated both perching and in flight. Every detail is perfect. My only criticism is that it's completely lacking in behavioral information. And the book is too large for convenient use in the field. I could not live without this book."
5,The Best So Far!!,"I started with Chester Reed. In 1936 I went to the first Peterson and have used Peterson as my principal help ever since. Yesterday I saw a flycatcher that didn't quite fit.I thought I would try Sibley. In a glance my problem was solved!! This new book has my vote. GET IT. Peter Mott, Former Bird Study Instructor, Maine Camp, National Audubon; Former President, Florida Audubon; Former President, New York City Audubon"
5,A great guide for the central Chihuahuan Desert,I received yesterday my copy of The Sibley Guide to the Birds. It is exciting to see the detailed illustration and to read the useful information provided in this book. It is much more than a field guide. I bird in the central Chihuahuan Desert and this guide will be a most useful tool in many seasons to come. It arrived just in time for the fall migration. Sibley has raised the standard several notches for field guides everywhere.
5,A new paradigm in bird guides,"After reading all the accolades, I don't need to pile on any more. This is truly a new standard in guide to birds. Do note that it is not small and it is not that light either, so it might not be a good field guide to carry around all day in the woods."
5,The Sibley Guide to Birds,The Sibley Guide is extremly thorough. I have found the book to be very helpful in the past for proper bird identification and now I'm very glad to own a copy myself.
5,Exceptional bird guide with original illustrations!,"Being a zoologist, I have seen many field guides. This one is one of my favorites! Sibley's own illustrations are amazingly detailed & realistic. Whenever I suggest an American bird guide to others, this is the one. It is larger & more expensive than other guides, but I believe it to be worth the cost. Good references always are!"
5,A great resource,"This was a Christmas gift to my 20-something daughter that does research and field study with birds, so she wanted this book. I think it will be a great resource for her."
4,Great service,"Book arrived in timely fashion and in ""new condition""Would order from this seller again."
5,Just what we were looking for,The product was delivered in a very timely manner and in exactly the condition we expected. Thank you!
5,must have,"This is an essential volume for anyone with an interest in birds. You need not be a ""serious"" birder to benefit from David Sibley's significant insights.There are detailed pictures and explanations for the most significant sub-species and regional variations in plumages. No other bird guide will be as helpful with field identification of tricky birds. This book is a genuine marvel. Buy it."
4,Was a gift,Was a gift I am not sure what the person that I gave the book to for Christmas thought about it
3,"Great Book! Unfortunately, the binding was defective. Replacement shipped free.","Love this book, the numerous color illustrations and fantastic information on each bird. But the 1st 16 pages were pinched in the binding and couldn't be turned without tearing them. Disappointing because it was shipped as a gift. Contacted Amazon and they replaced the defective book immediately via 2-day shipping."
5,A Book for Every Birders Back pack,"One of the two best books covering birds ofNorth America. To quote another well known phrase, ""Don't leave home (when you go birding) without it"" and if you have feeders in your yard, keep it right near the windows overlooking your garden"
5,"Lots of Info, Keep as reference","This has some great information in it. More than any other American Field Guide I have ever picked up!...But with all that info comes a price...IT IS HUGE for a Field Guide! Some folks may want to stuff it there backpack anyhow. I love all the many details on each species, even more than my National Geographic Guide. I think the week point may be the maps but not enough to be highly concerned. The truth is birds fly and they all go where they want anyway (yes, I really believe this.) I like the song I.D.s and the paintings are great, sometimes a little small for the pages but for some reason it does not bother me and it seems to make up for it with all the extra paintings. Great book! If you are a serious birder you must have this in your library!"
5,slow shipping is life,"although it took a week and a half to arrive, it got to me. . .and in great condition as well. Thanx"
2,A great guide that will live on the shelf,Too heavy to consider taking into the field. This will have to stay on the shelf to use as a reference. Go with the National Geographic Guide if you plan to go birding.
3,Eggzactly Wrong,"This is a book about identifying birds. The index does not include the word ""egg"", nor can any trace of the word be easily discovered....certainly no pictures. I am very disappointed with this monstrous oversight."
4,Exactly what we were looking for,"My husband and I are becoming more interested in birds and bird watching. This book was recommended to us by a friend. It was just the book I needed, and Amazon had it available. I would highly recommend this book!"
5,The pinnacle of birding guides,"This is without a doubt the ""go to"" guide for bird identification. It has very detailed pictures of species in many different forms and variations, and in many positions. Although it is rather large, most people leave it at home or in their car as a reference volume. But still, it is the ""last word"", every serious birder must have a copy."
5,Sibley Guide,"This is the best bird book of its kind on the market. While it is a little too large to be as handy as Peterson's for a field guide (unless you have very large pockets), it is indispensable for the serious birder. The convenience of having all of the information about a particular bird on one page cannot be overstated, and the illustrations are not only accurate but -- like Audubon's -- are works of art."
5,Comprehensive and definitive...,"If you're looking for a book that can be your primary guide for long time, this is it. Neophytes and experts alike will benefit from its excess of information and excellent illustration.Personally, I had little trouble navigating through this rather sizeable book. Everything from illustrations to maps are clearly laid out in an orderly manner. It is very important to be able to quickly find the information you need at critical moments when birding.I also had few problems toting this book around. Any avid birder would be in good enough shape that a few extra pounds of baggage won't kill him."
5,Book is great,"I bought this book for my husband who has long been an avid bird watcher. He had a book but when one of his friends brought in his copy of this book and my husband got a chance to look at it, he insisted that he wanted one, too. He said it just has so much more information on birds and he loves the photos."
5,Helps to keep the gum disease away!,Anybody who has gum disease (gingivitis) NEEDS to use this toothpaste! It's strong and so much better than swishing the liquid mouthwash around and having it burn. This toothpaste does not burn and your breath will be fresher and your dentist won't be very pleased about it because my gingivitis is gone now....which means...no more root scrapings! You should also take COq10 for gingivitis.....which is another secret that dentists don't tell you.
3,Enjoyable But Get Back to Brass-Hop!,"Coolbone's ""Brass-Hop"" album on Hollywood Records was amazing. This is enjoyable New Orleans swing, and an original groove like ""Multitude of Blues"" is great. But ""Do You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans"" is a misfire. Coolbone is about streetwise brass hip-hop, not fractured crooning! These guys are geniuses at what they invented: brass-hop. Get back!"
2,Strictly for beginners.,"This is a terrific book for a novice or beginner. It has very little to offer advanced users, however."
3,WASTE,"Got this for Christmas, launch mechanism didn't always fire the set yardage, sometimes went at least 20 yards extra. on top of that, balls were hard plastic and hard to catch without breaking your hand, and the balls frequently cracked, rendering them useless."
5,Awesome toy for an 8 year old,My son is 8 and got this toy for Christmas. He has played with it for hours on end. He can put the ball on and run out for a pass. With different settings he can go for short passes as well as long passes. Phenominal toy.
1,Never Worked,"We got this as a gift for Christmas and didn't open it until the weather was good enough. When we did, it didn't work. Toys R Us gave us an in store credit, but I am afraid to purchase another one."
3,Rated and reviewed by my 8 year old son,"It's good, but sometimes it takes too long to launch so you get bored waiting and get caught off guard and you could walk (or put your face) in front of it at the wrong time. Fun 'cuz it can throw a very long way (& very high up), but it is hard to catch. VERY LOUD! Broke once, but my Grandpa was able to fix it."
5,Radius arm bushings,"I installed these on a 1994 Ford Explorer 4x4 with out any difficulties. I've put on 6000 miles so far and they appear to be doing OK, still early to really rate them properly though."
3,Band is tuned a whole step down,The band is tuned a whole step down. So Ronnie is singing the tunes in a different and lower key than what we are used to hearing. That is why his vocals sound deeper and almost like he has a cold. It may be that he is trying to sing the songs a key lower as it would be easier and less stressful on his voice. For example Heaven and Hell is in the key of E but on this recording its in D. With the songs being performed a whole step lower the vocals just dont work as well. It just does not sound like Dio.
3,Monotone,"This is not RJD's best live offering by far. The track listing is the most impressive quality about this release. Evil or Devine and Last in Live are both much better live cd's from the legend himself. My real problem with this release is the sound. The guitars are buried a bit in most of the songs and that is a shame considering that the player is Doug Aldrich who also plays on Evil or Devine. I felt like disc one was just rather flat mainly because of the sound. In my book, Holy Diver and The Last in Line are among the greatest hard rock cd's ever which is why I am so surprised at how disinteresting disc one was for me. RJD's performance was great as usual. The bands performance of these classic tracks here is average."
2,Disappointed!!!!,"This came in with a 7 cd order, so I pop this cd in and literally took it out to make sure I had the right one in...I am disappointed in this one...the vocals are ok but not excellent and the song Holy Diver is awful here. Although a few songs here do sound Good and stand out I don't think it is worth the price unless you can find used.Too bad ...I had high hopes for a great Dio album. Luckily Grave Diggers ""25 to live"" came in with this one and it is a great live Heavy Metal 2 disc set."
2,Does it have to be so difficult to explain??,"I listened to this book on tape. I must have listened to the first tape 4 times. Be prepared, unless you are a psychologist yourself or in the field, to pause and look up words in the dictionary. There are no explanations in the text. I even had a hard time finding some of the terms on the internet dictionary and had to resort to serching the web for any info. All in all I felt I could have gotten so much more out of it had he used simpler terms."
5,the Mary Jane Girls are tight,together with My Boy Rick James the Mary Jane Girls give up the flavor here.some of the baddest Jams over the last 15-20 years are all here.these jams still pump like they just came out yesterday.great grooves all the way here.
5,"Learn to write and read, not the language!","This is an excellant book for learning how to write Devanagari and to read it. It will not teach you the language and any use of Hindi grammar and vocabulary is just to help you write it.Get the ""Teach Yourself Hindi"" course that goes with this book and has two cd's. That book was criticised on reviews for not showing how to write the letters. These go very well together and are not expensive."
3,OK book,"This is a very good book to learn Hindi script. However, I found that if you already have Beginner's Hindi or Teach Yourself Hindi complete course you can do without it, unless you want to elaborate on the script or learn more exceptions and rare characters."
3,An OK book....,"This book does give some background on the Hindi language, but what I don't like is WHY would the author teach archaeic words that are no longer used? This is not only confusing but he fails to give the updated version of the word. Also, when merging consanants, the author does not explain the certain letter is in fact a merge of 2 letters. This book basically jumps around and did not really help much but confuse the reader. The author should start with the alphabet, then vowels, then slowly show the reader how to make words out of these.....He does not even explain how a sentence is composed in which order example, noun, verb, etc.....these basics are taught in all other language books.Do NOT buy this book."
1,Basic premise totally unrealistic,"There is no way an immature,irresponsible naval officer such as the XO in this garbage book would ever be placed in a position of such responsibility. His portrayal of senior officers is equally off base. There may a bozo or two like the senior officers in both the American and Chinese navies in this book but I seriously doubt it. Robinson should stick to tactics. That was interesting reading."
2,NOT WORTH THE EFFORT,"I like submarine novels, and if the author knows his or her way around a nuclear boat, then I try to give him/her the benefit of the doubt on their treatment of the story, providing, of course, that's it's filled with realistic underwater super action. But I'm afraid I have to go along with the naysayers on this one. It's shallow, unbelievable, something is definitely wrong with the writing, and it's just not worth the effort. I managed to read the whole thing thinking it would get better, but nothing worked. From the fly on the wall view of the Chinese high command, to the idiotic Executive Officer of the U.S.S. Seawolf, it was a total let down. I wish I had watched television. I give it two stars, and that's being generous."
2,Good story line ruined by this author,"Follwoing my read of USS SEawolf, I doubt I'll purchase another book by this author. His representation of all US Navy personnel as racists was offensive. Surely not everyone in the submarine service believes that all Chinese should be working in laundries or as take out delivery boys. It really takes a lot to bug me enough to write a review like this but this guy did it.I'm also over his repetative use of words like ""growled"" as in ""The plane growled across the sky."" Somebody buy this guy a thesaurus."
3,"Starts off great, but....","After the first few chapters of this book, I was so excited, I thought I had found a great new writer. I jumped online and bought two more of his books.However, I soon grew tired of his character development. Every American was brave, strong, smart and hugely talented in some fashion. Every Chinese character was weak, cowardly, sneaky, etc. You get the picture. I like patriotic books a la Clancy, but this was a bit too chauvinistic."
2,A big Disappointment,"The book has good pace and narrative drive. The only problem is that the charactors of the XO and the President are totally out of wack. The big secret regarding the XO is completely unbelivable as is the crew's ignorance of his true identity. De facto President Morgan rants and raves so much it is irritating. I enjoyed his previous work but when a plot hole is as big as this is annoying. As others have said, the characterizations are cardboard and Robinson editorializes too much."
4,solid and truthfull,"This book covered truthfully and acurately the aspects of submarines, seals, the president and the chinese. The personas of the chinese leaders were real regarding their obtuse nature, the mission of the seals was executed as a real one would, the ending is an unexpected twist that only adds to the quality of the book, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a good adventure but without all the hard to understand military prose that tom clancy adds"
5,As Good as It Gets,"""U.S.S. Seawolf"" is the first of Patrick Robinson's books I have read, and now I intend on getting my hands on the others. I felt myself put into the shoes of the various characters, able to experience their lives vicariously through Robinson's vivid and complete descriptions. This book hit the spot better than a laser-guided surface-to-air missile."
2,Wishful Militarism,"I have read all of the Patrick Robinson books and have enjoyed them even though Robinson verges on the edge of serious right wing political militarism. This last book is not only on the verge as his other books have been, this one falls off the edge into significant political right-wing claptrap. This author is too good to let himself drift into the blind espousal of such ideology. Thus I was disappointed in this book. The story is fun; it kept me interested; it stretched credibility a little too often. But those lapses are hallmarks of such books. What pushed me over the edge were the constant references to pro/redneck/republican/Limbaugh generalities. The Oliver North-like colonel was too much. I will read one more of Robinson's; hopefully he can rise above this god-awful ideology."
2,Where do I start?,"I'm new to this author but I got the book for free (Thank God I didn't waste money on it.) From the beginning I was getting into what I thought was going to be a good read. It started out well and then quickly went down hill. Too right-wing, Clinton started it all, Chinese are ""Little Pricks"", etc. The ending was a GREAT letdown. What happened to Linus? Why did Judd commit suicide, what happened to the Chinese C in C? All questions with no answers. I think I'll skip this author from now on."
2,Getting Worse,"I recently picked this up at Sydney Airport, and having read his others, was very disappointed. Approximately 50% of the book is a sycophantic promo for special forces, including deafeningly wooden dialogue, and the other half has a good plot (mind you it has been done before by Dimicurio). If you are an avid fan, wait for the soft cover, because you'll feel disgruntled paying full freight for this for an author that has been rushed by his publisher. 2.5 stars"
2,Submarines + right-wing rhetoric = bad book,"I have all of Patrick Robinson's previous books. While nothing special, they all had decent stories containing a bunch of comptetent American military men cruising around the world in submarines or undergoing secret operations to keep the world free for the American way.The characters and plot in USS Seawolf are fairly standard Robinson. The characters aren't too deep. The plot is ok, but is very slow in the middle.However, after finishing USS Seawolf, I felt that I like I had been bludgeoned over the head with right wing ideas without mercy for 3 hours straight. According to the book, politicians are stupid, Chinese are evil, and military men are the only people worth anything on this planet (unless they're the offspring of politicans, in which case they're useless).I was prepared for an average techno-military thriller. Instead, I got a book that seems like it should have been serialized in an ultra-right-wing magazine."
2,Navy thriller spoiled by author's perosnal axes to grind,"Robinson spins a decent tale of the US Navy's latest and best submarine on a clandestine mission to China. There is a good grasp of the technology and Naval Operations. Usual cast of stock characters include the gruff all-knowing admirals and macho, superhero officers and men in the field, evil and sadistic foreign powers...Interspersed throughout the book are dogmatic asides slamming the Clinton administration in general and that era's relations with China. Is Patrick Robinson really Pat Buchanan? Also, the Americans in the book make constant anti-Chinese racist and stereotypical disparaging remarks. So Solly, two stars Pat."
2,mind-numbing predictability,"Just didn't float my boat, I guess (ha ha). Robinson seems to have directed his work at those who find Tom Clancy a literary challenge and Rush Limbaugh too liberal. Aside from that, this is nothing the average reader hasn't seen before. The characters weren't well developed, leaving something more to be desired. Save your money."
2,Good Book With a Lousy Ending,"I enjoyed the book although not as much as Robinson's earlier efforts. The ending, however is rushed and has people acting out of character. Without giving it away, I don't mind unusual endings, but they have to hang together with the rest of the book."
2,Could be much better,"After reading the first three submarine thrillers which I found really fantastic (especially HMS Unseen), I was very much disappointed with USS Seawolf. I felt there was something missing to glue the parts together and especially the ending could have been more elaborate. I hope there will be a fifth one but judging from the ending I very much doubt it."
4,I'm sorry I've missed this author!,"I was fairly impressed. This was my first book by Patrick Robinson, but I will definitely be reading his others!This book will not win any prizes, but its a great read. The action is tight and kept me interested.I did have some problems with the dialog between the SEALs (they really don't talk that way do they?), and the total collapse of the President at the end kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. (Judd would have made an interesting character in future books). I also would have liked it if he had not polarized the two sides so much (the US is ultra-good, China ultra-evil)."
2,A Disappointment,"I give this book two stars for action, but that's it. The plot has major holes, such as the Chinese conveniently hiding the prisoners on an island jail, readily accessible to the SEALS. Where was the Chinese air force during the escape?? The right-wing comments were way overdone. A second term President completely falls apart??My biggest problem with the book is the ending. It's completely unsatisfying. Its a bummer. The deal about Crocker's dad writing a tell all book did not fix it. And how about some closure on the incompetent Chinese leaders?This book does not meet the standard Patrick set for himself in his previous books."
2,"Captains Don't Say ""Aye""","Submariners will gag on the techical inaccuracies and a vocabulary lifted from Jack Aubrey stories - ""for'ard""? A Blue Seabag? A story with real page-turner potential was sadly wasted."
2,USS Seawolf,"This is the first Patrick Robinson book that I have read and I am not motivated to read any others. The fact that he totally misrepresented the San Diego Zoo makes me wonder about his creditability regarding other information in his story. I realize this is fiction but if you are going to mention a world class site, you should have correct information. His characters were interesting and he did have good story development. There were no low points where you could be inclined to skip pages."
2,Good idea but poorly done,"I picked up this book used in Krakow even though using my Nook a lot.Just wanted to add to the other one star and two star reviews. The plot is a good idea but breaks down in the end. I enjoyed the sea story part. The book totally breaks down in the ground combat... unrealistic, many technical mistakes and hokey lines (like a bad John Wayne movie).... I almost tossed the book before the end but is an easy read and now getting painful.If you are looking for a good action read skip this one."
2,"Ok, bad ending","In my view this is his worst book yet. I've read Nimitz Class, Kilo Class, and H.M.S Unseen, and this is nothing compared to those. It starts off ok, but gets slow in the middle. It does not have a lot of action in it, and the NSA Arnold Morgan is well out of character. At one point he said he would have left an entire submarine crew all for trade relations, when at another point he said he didn't care about trade. The was other instances of poor character development, and the ending is poor. I do not think it fits the book, and he rushed it, not properly explaining what was going on. I would recomend it only because I like to read techno-thrillers, and especially read all the books of certain authors, but I wouldn't recomend it to be at the top of you list."
2,"Not a bad read, but I've read better","The other reviews here are very accurate when they mention the weak ending. Overall, the book is an enjoyable read, save for the one-dimensional characters and horrible ending. The fact that the XO of USS Seawolf is a complete moron doesn't make any sense. Early on in the book, after a slight mishap on the boat, the XO pretty much panics and begs the Captain to surface. A true XO would have kept his cool and dealt with the situation. The Navy would not allow such a spineless ninny to be the XO of a nuclear submarine. So many things in this book were audacious, I felt I had to write a review to vent my frustration. Oh, Patrick, you started so well. What happened, buddy?"
5,A Very Powerful Book,"This book should be required reading of every couple with children before a divorce decree is granted. All the lies that our society has bought into over the last 40 years about how ""children are resilient"" and don't get hurt by divorce are shattered by the careful and extensive research that went into this book."
1,Very unscientific and unfounded.,"Don't let the media hype around this book fool you into thinking her findings are scienfically valid. She points out all the negatives about what happens in a divorce, but doesn't mention anything about how those same children would have fared if parents stayed together (how would you mature if all you see was constant fighting by your parents?). Studies has shown conclusively that parents that stayed together 'for the children' despite their unhappiness cause more harm to their children than a happily divorced family. If she had used a control group and followed those children (whose parents stayed together despite being unhappy), she would have discovered the same thing as dozens of other scientifically valid studies have: that children who come from those family are worst off than children that come from divorce parents."
3,just a thought,"I believe, as Kenny Loggins puts it, that what serves one's heart serves everyone around you. Kids know when you're not truly happy, including happiness in being married to a current spouse. Although there may be merits to sticking out a marriage that's not completely fulfilling, staying can also teach kids not to follow their deepest yearnings--to follow their hearts in searching for the real thing in love. They may later find themselves in their 30s wondering why they're currently stuck in a status quo marriage, despite a deep knowing that real love has never been a part of their experience."
5,Here's The Missing Link,"For years what we have been hearing and what we have been seeing have not ""blended"" so well. Wallerstein gives us a missing piece to a puzzle. Her writing is crisp. Her stories poignant.Now we can hear from children and let them tell us of the lives they've lived these last 25 years since their parents' divorce. Wallerstein stands tall, right in the middle of part of the answer to our quandries about divorce and family, family and two-family families, and . . .divorce, and it's effect. Excellent work!"
5,This book was comforting...,"This book was oddly comforting. I have felt like my whole life has been so different from kids with married parents and always felt foolish for saying so, but after reading this book I was validated and that helped me in my healing process. She even gets specific about a child of divorce's life...we are great at packing a bag real quick, great at reading crowds, etc...I wish my parents would read this book, I think all parents that have chose divorce would because it will shed light on your child's behavior young or older."
1,Nothing New!,"This is just another book filled with data that we've been reading in magazines for decades, with the same biased slant.Wallerstein fails to disclose that the cause for 90% of divorces is that judges guarantee that the mothers will get custody!"
2,not much hope here,"As an adult child of divorce, I identified with many of the stories. It helps to know you weren't alone and to get some insight on why you are as you are. However, it left me totally bummed, pessimistic, and not very hopeful about my marriage prospects. Worse, there was little advice or encouragement on how to ""turn things around"" as an adult. I almost wish I hadn't read this, I feel more doomed than ever before."
4,Much to Ponder,"While Dr. Wallerstein doesn't take a position on the desirability of divorce itself, she presents a powerful argument that we all should be paying a great deal more attention to the needs of the children of divorced couples. Rather than expecting them to either welcome or come around to accepting their new familial reality, we need to involve them in working out that reality in their own terms, meeting their own needs. It is interestingly, thoughtfully, and often frighteningly presented. This is must reading for all who are involved with or touched by children of divorce (need I say everyone?)."
5,Very insightful.,I read this book several years ago. It is very insightful regarding the effects of divorce as children of divorced marriages moved into adulthood.
4,Read this to better understand the one you love,"I never seriously thought about divorce until I became invovled in a mature relationship with a child of divorce. At the time I purchased this book, I was searching for answers as to why my partner in life for almost five years seemed so fearful to make a commitment to marriage. This book contains no easy answers but offers explanations as to why children of divorce, who may be so confident in their careers and emotionally supportive of their lovers, may be terrified of the institution of marriage. The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce demonstrates how the most profound impact of divorce is revealed only when children of divorce enter mature relationships. Ultimately, Wallerstein shows that in order to heal, children of divorce must bravely face deeply-rooted insecurities on their own terms and in their own time. This book should be read not only by children of divorce but by their partners who love them."
5,Excellent source material!,"I've been searching for a book such as this for quite some time. I purchased this book as source material for 3D modeling, and all the hand drawn illustrations are simply amazing! Many interior, exterior and close-up shots of Japanese architecture. Several floor plans and isometric views of various homes and temples.Having only recieved my book the day before, I have not had a chance to read it from cover to cover, but what I have read was informative and well written. While you may not be able to build your very own ""to code"" Japanese home with this book, as a source of information and inspiration, it's a tremendous book!"
1,Not practical if on the go,"If you take medication around the clock and need to bring it with you when you leave the house, this is not the pill box for you. You can't take just the day's worth of meds with you, as individual days are not removable from the box. Don't know many folks on round-the-clock meds who would want to bring the entire week's worth box around with them."
1,apex,The lid will not stay on and I am constanty spilling my pills spill out everywhere too big and awkward
3,It's OK,"Instead of there being a little door on each compartment, there is a lifting action that is needed to open each bin. I like that it is very durable, but it is very unhandy for my Son, who is a stroke survivor, to access. He is unable to use his right hand, so to take his meds, after lifting the lid on the day and time he wants, he has to lift the whole pill box to his mouth. . A better design would be ; each day would lift out of the main box for easier access."
2,Disappointed,"I probably should have looked a bit closer or read the reviews closer. With my MIL's current pill box - each days worth of meds come OUT of the main container - she then keeps them in a pocket or on her walker tray. But this med planner - although large - just isn't nearly as handy. She would have to carry the whole week's worth of meds around with her :0( I may save it 'just in case' but will probably never use it. I was disappointed - AGAIN.The Apex Medi Tray is the one we have now or one very similar - but when I ordered another one on Amazon - it came in BLUE and you cannot see the pills inside - impossible to tell is the pills have been taken unless you open each window. So, another one hits the dust :0(http://www.amazon.com/Apex-Medi-Tray-Times-Days/dp/B000KI5QVU/ref=pd_sim_hpc_3If someone knows where I can find The Apex Medi Tray or similar in CLEAR like the one we have now - please comment here.Thanks."
1,WORTHLESS - Want to punish yourself - BUY THIS,This item is a piece of S___. Buy this only if you want to PUNISH yourself. Go to Wal-Mart & they have a 4 a day prescription holder that snaps for about $6.50. It is GREAT.
4,Good pill box - and here's the size that's missing in the description...,"Great product, except the description did not include size of the Mediplanner II. Would have given 5 stars, if it had. For your info the size is 8.25"" by 5.5"" by 1.125"". Each individual pill space is approximately a cube with each side measuring 1.125"". Much larger than the 4-times-per-day weekly pill box I had before. Ran out of room in that box when I started adding supplements in addition to my meds. When I ordered it, I just guessed and hoped it would be larger based on the number of pills another reviewer said they used. I'm glad I guessed right. It's a very nice pill box. Be sure to let it warm up in your house before opening... if it arrives and is left outside in the cold, the plastic might break when you open it up to fill. That's said on the product instructions, but I just thought I'd give you a heads up, if you live in a cold part of the country like I do. Hope this helps. -Rick"
2,Beware the strange layout - Bed & Evening are reversed,"I read the glowing reviews for this item, and even went to great lengths to order two via the US and have a friend bring it half way across the world for my father in law. Imagine my disappointment when I saw it up close, and realised that the ""bed"" and ""evening"" slots are the wrong way around!! Even the numbering and the braille are the wrong way around.Other than that, the container really is a good size. The spaces are big enough for shaky hands and the writing is clear. But have a good look at the picture before you order it for anyone who might get mixed up with their medication - it's meant to be a simple system and this is a really dangerous layout. I am SO disappointed."
1,Not what I expected,"Mine arrived damaged, the plastic hinge on one of the compartments was broken, the lid fell off when I opened it to fill it. It can't be snapped back in place without the hinge.In order to return it, you have to call Maxi Aids' customer service department in order to get a ""return authorization number. No returns can be processed without prior authorization."" Of course most people, including me, aren't going to jump through so many hoops just to return a $5.95 product. The shipping and handling alone was almost the price of the product anyway... ($5.90)Also, I thought that each compartment opened separately - they don't. Each lid opens two compartments at a time. You can re-close one compartment, but the upper one only, which forces you to reverse your dosages. I'm spoiled for single opening compartments so I can tip the whole thing over and get just the dose I need. I'm going to get anotherEZY Dose Deluxe Medtime Planner.Ah well, live and learn..."
5,Dare to believe in yourself,This is a great little book to give as a present to your friends and loved ones. There are 65 different uplifting quotes in this book from people of many walks of life. We all face obstacles but the most important thing is to believe in yourself...this book helps me to do it!
4,"Great Book, Great Price","I didn't pay much for this book, it arrived in excellent condition, and it contains a lot of the information I was looking for in an English text book. Great book and great price."
1,Not what it seemed,We recieved this product expecting certain stickers in the book very dissapointed in not receiving them. The stickers was the main reason we bought this item.
5,Great Book!,"All I have to say is read it!!! I loved this book, it does have a corny ending and everything seems forced to fit together, but thats not why I loved it. It was a good love story for me."
3,could have been better,"This book was filled with the same vampires lines as most vampire books. The plot was thin, and so the book was too. An easy read. I think this book was a great starter book for the author, I have high expectations for her. The book was well written, but needed something extra, which she did not add. So if you need a quick read while flying, or traveling, this is it. I am waiting to see her next work, hopefully she will continue to build her skill."
2,A waste of money,"I didn't like this book. I didn't finish it because I couldn't get through it. I kept going back to read but lost interest. I am an avid vampire/paranormal romance reader and this is not one I'll likely remember. The story is forced. I do NOT love the characters. Like D.B. Reynolds, Vampire in AMerica series. I fell in love with the characters which made me want to keep reading but these two. What are their names??? Oh yeah William and Savanah. Brain tumor? She has a brain tumor and wants to be bitten to live. He's, he's just not a strong, powerful Vampire like other's I've read. No personality. Well, there are many other books to read so I'll move on."
4,Enjoyable,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I enjoy a good vampire romance, but I'm looking for something new and innovative.I love the darker side of this genre, without going over bored. I recommend this book to any paranormal fan."
2,Trite,"Well written but an old, tired and hackneyed plot. I think the only vampire cliché not utilized was the requirement of ""resting"" on native soil. The author has potential but needs to get a plot."
3,Better than some,"I thought this book was better than some of the paranormal books out on the market today. I was glad that this novel had romance. I do have to agree with some of the reviewers, there were a few too many vampire cliches which isn't really a bad thing, but kind of, I don't know...played out. I did think the overall plot was pretty original. I would also recommend to fans of this book/genre the Knights of the Darkness Chronicles by D.N. Simmons.I'd by another book from this author in the future."
4,"Fun, convenient!","Santa brought this for my 2 year old daughter this X-mas, and she loves it! It folds up pretty nicely, and doesn't take up too much room. I haven't had it tip over yet, and it doesn't seem too likely to do it, at least when folded (it is just as versatile folded as not, btw). It does not have as many buttons as I would like (hence the 4 stars and not the full 5), and i think it could be more interactive, but my daughter loves it and she seems to be satisifed with the sounds it does make. All in all, I'd recommend this."
2,Good as a kitchen not a language toy,I bought this toy for my language school and was very disappointed. I would have rather bought a non-electronic kitchen and just labeled things for what it turned out to be. The Spanish on it is Spoken in Castillan-a dialect not common to Latin American or North American Spanish dialects. The speaker speaks so quickly that you have to know what she is saying to understand. This toy had great potential as a teaching toy but blew it on the most important detail. As a kitchen it's fine but then overpriced. Save the money and get a video.Language Exchange of Northern Colorado
1,Tips over WATCH OUT!,"Very nice colors and great washer and dryer with the sound effects loved that and even the burner with sounds but you can bearly hear it and the switch is located on the burner so the kids can push that back and forth all day long which drives you crazy, but that's about it, doors bearly opened very hard even for me to open and shut, my boys tipped it over right away not stable at all. I quess because of its round bottom it's just not safe had to return it. Because I have two boys that are playing with it and a daughter, not good for multible children. When the kitchen is open you can feel that any minute when opening one of the cabinets that it will tip.I got the Step 2 Deluxe Life Style Kitchen very stable and worth every penny. Accomadates 5 kids at once and will never tip over and the kids won't get hurt."
2,Not Happy,"I bought this toy for my daughter for her second birthday... I was really excited because everytime we go to her cousins house she goes straight to the kitchen. It took about 1 1/2 hours to put together and then out of all the things that are suppossed to make noise the only think that worked was the stove top. I tried to contact little tykes several times, but I could never get a responce. Also, It only came with 3 pieces of food which my daughter got bored with. Overall, I am very dissapointed with this toy... I am upgrading to the step2 kitchen, seems better."
4,My son LOVES this kitchen,We looked at different kitchens to find one that was not girlie. And finally deecideedd on this one. We picked a winner my 2yo son loves this kitchen. He got it Christmas morning and spent all morning playing with it before he would even look at the other prersents left to open. I wish the microwave actually beeped and the oven could recognise foods also but it is a great kitchen and not too expensive. He has had it for over a week and still loves it.
2,"Nearly unusable for a ""petite"" 2 year old","My daughter got this kitchen for Christmas. She is nearly 2 years old but I don't think she'll be able to play with it before a long time.It's true that she is a ""petite"" girl: she can barely reach the countertop so the microwave or coffee machine are just way too high for her.Then, the doors are very hard to open (fridge, oven...). She gets so frustated when she tries that after a few attempts she goes away and play with something else.There is not room to put the dishes (except in the sink)As fore the iron, it's just too big to fit in the stand...All the doors (washer, dryer, dishwasher and hoven) look alike so I'm not sure kids can really understand what each one stands for...Hopefully when our daughter is a little taller she'll have fun with it because for the money I was expecting something more usable. We should probably have gotten her the Chicco Star kitchen (more basic but looks easier to play with)."
1,Toy assembly,I purchased the Cook N Clean Kitchen as the main Christmas present for my daughter. Christmas Eve I was assemblying the kitchen when I came to the doors for the washer and dryer. The door for the washer would not stay on because the pre-drilled hole was slanted outwards and was only half a circle/was through the front of the washer. Unless I want a door that falls off every time my daughter opens the washer or I want to drill my own hole and then have a product with a hole in the front I will need to return the kitchen. My recommendation to others is to not wait until the night before an occasion to assemble this product because you may not be able to do so. Now I will need to return the kitchen in hopes the store will have a non-defective one in stock after Christmas. I am very diappointed in the quality control.
2,Disappointed,"We bought this thinking it was the most ""bang for our buck"" type kitchen. It is cute, but to me not worth the money. The iron is hard for little fingers to get on the sensors to make it work and there isn't nearly enough storage for the food items, pots/pans. It is great for a compact kitchen, but if you are looking for something to last for a few years, invest in a different one."
2,WHERE IS THE ADD-ON FOOD!?,"I bought this product for my nephew. He plays with it all the time. HOWEVER - it is extremely difficult to find the add-on products that allow it ""OVER 700 phrases"". Not only that, but the few add ons that are accessible only come with 2 or three actual ""FOOD"" items that would work with this product. I have searched the web and have been unable to find any other products other then the breakfast set (which most of the items come with the kitchen), pizza, and pasta. It is his birthday and the cake and candles add on would be great, but i have yet to find a store that sells it - online or off. I am very disappointed."
3,To Cook or Not to Cook?,"Overall I am rating this kitchen as a toy and for a toy it serves the purpose of kitchen. I was disappointed that Santa brought the kitchen that had to be returned because the holes for the screws weren't drilled or for the microwave. I was also a little let down that the only area that recognizes the food is the burner. I just keep thinking that I've never baked a cake, bread, or cookies on the burner. We have all but the breakfast pack and are still waiting for all the phrases. My 22 month old likes it okay, but it doesn't keep her attention. I guess I wanted to get what I paid for since there were cheaper versions and I opted for what I thought was the ""bells and whistles"" model. It's not a bad toy just overpriced, I do like Little Tike toys and I'm optimistic my daughter will like it more as she gets older."
2,Daughter Never Plays with anymore,I bought this toy for Christmas over 6 months ago..My Daughter (2) seem thrilled with the toy for about 2 days..Now she never plays with it...As far as I'm concerned it was a waste of money....
4,The fun goes on and on....,"We bought this kitchen for my 18 month old daughter who seems fascinated with every kitchen toy we come upon. After lots of research, we chose this one for the good price and decent reviews. My daughter has not stopped playing with this. She loves it. She doesn't care about the fact that it talks. She just loves to open the doors and put stuff in the cabinets. Which leads me to my only complaint. The handles on all the doors are not very good. They don't work well with little hands (or big hands for that matter), especially the microwave door. It's hard to get a good grip on the handle. I wish they had made handles that you put your hand through to actually grasp it. Other than that, the toy is great. With just the cups, food, etc that came with the kitchen there is hours of fun. We did get 2 of the food packs, but they aren't essential."
5,Great and Amazing,My 3 yr old Daughter loves this toy she thinks its great when it specks different Languages.. My 5 yr old son also plays with it and said he thinks he should get one of his own... The both can say French Fries in Spanish now....
4,Really Good Choice,"I struggled with which kitchen set to get as well. This kitchen is super sturdy and the phrases that the burner says are a cute feature. I'm glad it doesn't ""talk"" in more ways, because that would impede imagination in my opinion (and drive me nuts!). So, if you're looking for a really good kitchen that looks like it will last forever, this is it.I will say that she is almost completely uninterested in the ironing part (she's 2). I could have easily got the model that costs less and doesn't have it I believe. Anyway, you won't go wrong with this kitchen!"
5,Civil War seen through the heart,"Sarah Morgan was a well educated, highly literate woman whose experience in the Civil War is vividly and passionately recorded. A young and attractive person, she is not only intensely engaged as the war progresses and deaths mount, but she is also bedeviled by her own attractiveness to men. Her love for her family members fighting and dying comes between her and the would-be suitors, whom she describes perhaps a little too sharply. I particularly liked her direct, almost modern style. She obviously wrote for herself and not for posterity, which is our gain, since she gives such an unvarnished account of what is happening around her. Regardless of the way history has evaluated her position on the war, the reader's sympathies become engaged with Sarah herself, her losses, her grief, and her wonderful energy.Jane Carter Webb"
3,"Worth the read, a good source for reenactors","So far I am enjoying the diary of Sarah Morgan, it is my opinion that Scarlett O'Hara was patterned after her. Her writing is very interesting without being droll or boring.And as a Civil War reenactor with a Southern character, it is helpful learning how the women of the south felt and what they did while enduring the hardships of the war. Having to leave your home and all the worldly things that we all hold so dear was a hardship for many of them. Thank goodness for those who were successful in hiding family heirlooms and whatnot to pass down through the generations. It really was horrible how the ""Federals"" (Yankees) destroyed there homes just for the spite of it.The long and short of it is; I am enjoying the diary very much and learning another stitch in our history."
5,Wonderful documentary on the Delta blues today,"This brand new documentary from Jeff Konkel and Roger Stolle gives a true vision of the today situation of the juke joints and the blues in the Delta area. Remarkably filmed, it intersperes strong interviews with musicians, juke joint owners and patrons with great musical sets. Very well filmed and recorded. Enthralling!And what a good idea to have subtitled the film, a thing that is very often lacking from US music documentaries and nevertheless very useful for non-Americans. This essential set combines the DVD + a CD of all the songs featured in the film."
5,A great DVD,"This is a film that is well worth watching multiple times. There are parts of the film that are very sad as it shows the struggles of the Blues in Mississippi, but at the same time it is inspiring watching the great Blues performers that are still there, thus the uplift (and that is in part what the Blues is all about). The quality of the cinematography/editing/sound is topnotch. My favorite performers in this film are Big A & The All-Stars and Terry Harmonica Bean. The interviews with Red are great!"
5,Outstanding!!!,"Splendid DVD (and companion CD) - well filmed and recorded, reminiscent of the exceptional ""You See Me Laughing"" blues DVD. It will be a long time before this CD leaves rotation in my car. Don't dilly dally getting down to The Delta to absorb this hypnotic, CURRENT experience. The Clarksdale-Memphis-Oxford triad is a gem full of vast delights - historic, musical, literary, gastronomic, social - to be discovered, all pulsed by the Mississippi River. I first came from the Virginia in 2009. It's pulled me back every year since - now it's a scheduled, annual event. Roger Stolle at the Cat Head store (and website) in Clarksdale can make sure you don't miss anything important during you visit. Have an unforgetable, historic good time!"
3,Interesting,"I was pleasantly surprised. My only question is, will there be a sequel? I see interesting prospects for Leah and Jeff...."
3,"A bit thick, but good for discussion of CE",A good discussion starter for christian education. Canon as a model for CE is a great idea. We read this book in a seminary class so the often difficult text was more or less appropriate but may not be the smoothest reading for other settings.
4,Pleasant Surprise,This movie is worth the watch....lots of twists and surprises the commentary alone is worth the price...lots of gore as well
5,Great Lego set that is hard to find,"It's a set that is not found in the Lego stores, so it was a great find. Allows children to create cars, trucks, airplanes, ships and other moving vehicles using the simple motor and remote control."
4,"Very, very useful if you have specific info you want.","I've found two books about the Academy Awards which contain lots of interesting information. The ""Academy Awards Handbook"" both through its year-by-year arrangement and its extensive index allows me to quickly find the specific information I'm looking for. The other book ""The Envelope, Please,"" has lots of delightful information but the table of contents listing is rather cutesy (What exactly would you expect to find under ""Missed Opportunities"" or ""First and Foremost""?) and there's NO index; it has to be read as a novel and has essentially no usefulness as a reference work!"
2,"If you're online, no point in getting it","Data is data. The scant anecdotal information in this book is not bad - But not enough. The fact that you're reading this on Amazon shows that you already have access to most of the information in this book, and with the internet movie database in a far more user-friendly form. Other books on Oscar (for the same price I strongly recommend the excellent ""..AND THE ENVELOPE PLEASE"" by A.W. Jones.) give all the same info plus a heck of a lot more with added style, humor, and passion. There's better books out there than this one."
4,Useful but often inaccurate,"This book would be ideal as an Oscar handbook if it were not plagued by small innaccuracies. But the anecdotes are interesting, though scant, and the Oscar pool predictions section does come in handy."
3,Not the best book on the topic,"Lots of questions and issues, few answers. Far too much time spent plugging his Silicon Valley buddies. Far from the worst book written about business on the Internet, but certainly not the best."
2,Real Thin,The only reason I did not rate this book a 1 is because I have a respect for the author's other books... Spend your money somewhere else.
1,Buzzwords without the beef,"Mckenna has done good thinking about business today (see Harvard Business Review article, ""Marlketing is Ebverything) but this time has written a gassy piece that fails to deliver on its subtheme: ""preparing for the age of the never satisfied customer."" Mostly he calls for speeding up interaction with customers but knocks market research and fails to offer any specific substitutes"
1,poop,"If you are starting an internet company, or looking to advance the one you have started: This book doesn't even make good nonsense."
2,Really not so good.,"Real Time is really not so good. No new ideas or inspiring thoughts. Reading it is a waste of time basically. I gave it two because you always learn something from ""getting into"" the writers mind."
2,Disappointed,"I am a Doctoral student in Management. I read this book with lot of expectation. But, Mr. McKenna has let me down. All that has been said has happened - the book fails to give any new insight nor does it give any model for future."
2,Painfully unnecessary,"With praise from the likes of the CEO of Netscape and Jerry ""Yahoo!"" Yang, I expected something profound. However, I found this book to be worse than Tapscott's ""Digital Economy."" Tell us something we don't know! This book is a little too late but those who are a little too late may find this book a revelation. It is easier to digest compared to ""The digital economy""I also found the URLs after each company mentioned unnecessary. (Perhaps to reinforce the fact that everyone has a Web site?) The URLs are general addresses and do not point to a specific page to support the writer's claims.Pass this one up."
1,Reege has let us down,"Unfortunately, Regis McKenna has graduated from the Nicholas Negroponte School of Authors With Only The Obvious To Say.Real Time is the first book he has written since graduating at the top of Nick's class. It's a colossal disappointment for anyone seeking more than a cursory feel for what is happening in this subject.Rather than buy this book, venture on the net and waste three hours surfing without a purpose. You'll learn and experience more than getting between the covers with Mr. McKenna"
5,Superb Microphone!,"I'm the lead singer in our rock band. We cover Wilco, Rolling Stones, Mellencamp, Pearl Jam, Radiohead, etc. I only list these bands because I find it helpful when others tell me their style. So I've been using Shure SM58 for years and was happy with it. I was in need of a new mic because my Shure was pretty banged up and I actually would get a small electrical shock on the lips when I got too close to it :) New mic time, right? So after some research and having read a lot of positive reviews for the Sennheiser e935, I decided to try it. The difference was huge. The straight sound from the Sennheiser is very warm with great clarity. There's almost no need for any effects (reverb, etc) on the vocals because it has such a great tone by itself. It makes my job much easier and if you're considering which mic to buy in this price range, look no further. Buy this microphone and you will sound like a pro on stage."
5,My daughter loves this book!,"My 4 year old daughter has loved this book for the past two years. Giselle Potter is a fantastic artist and her story is so sweet. I love that it's based on her actual experiences as a child. What a fun conversation-starter about travel, school, art, and choices...if I choose to bring it up, otherwise it's just a fantastic story to read."
5,Healthy Natural Dog Food,I like the idea this dog food is holistic with limited ingredients. This dog food is human grade. I picked this Wellness food to help my dogs with allergies. Their fur and skin look great with no dry itchy skin. No tummy problems either.
3,nice,"The design is great, but we've got some bottles that we bought in France and it doesn't fit.. only the small bottles fit..."
3,"Good, basic wine rack",I like this wine rack and I get a lot of compliments on it. The only problem I have is that not all wine bottles fit into the holes. Even some bottles that look like they should are slightly too large.
3,Overpriced and overhyped,"The content of this book is OK. It is clear that a great deal of research and thought was invested in it. However, most of the information presented is open source and can be found with just a little bit of google-fu. As a SIGINT commando and EW expert, I can really only rate this book 3 stars considering the price. $150 is incredibly expensive and almost laughable."
1,Could be the worst coffee pot ever,"I bought this via amazon for the price, stainless steel, and programable features. The upper handle clip broke in a month. West Bend had no replacement clip and put me on a waiting list. When there was coffee all over the counter this morning, I went right out and threw the whole thing, with still hot spilled coffee, right in the trash can. I went to the cellar, and got my old no feature procter silex (under a sawbuck at target) and made my morning coffee. Only those wishing personal agravation should throw away their hard eraned money on this landfill junk."
2,No good!,"Has a timer, a digital clock - and I can read it (see next review), makes a good coffee, but doesn't keep it hot for long. And a pot broke in 2 month, when i was cleaning it."
1,a desecration of the Ministry name,"After hearing (and liking) tribute albums dedicated to NIN and Skinny Puppy, I foolishly shelled out for this, thinking ""It's Ministry--where could they possibly go wrong?"" Well, ""Devilswork"" somehow manages to take (most of) the band's good songs and dumb them down to the dregs of sub-Godsmack death-metal rubbish. A few covers from ""The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste"" ('Thieves,' 'Burning Inside,' 'Breathe') are acceptable, but still long shadows of their original selves. But for the few GOOD moments on this album, there are a lot of grating desecrations of songs, namely 'TV II' and 'The Game Show' (done in the vein of 'hey yo' Limp D1cksh1t). With any luck, the bands featured on this album will remain just as unknown for the rest of their 'careers' as they are now.note: there are at least 2 other Ministry tribute albums available on Invisible (and maybe Cleopatra), and are most likely better than this."
2,Some things make ya wonder,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Ministry since I first heard Revolting Cocks. Ministry has changed quite a bit over the years. I've got several Ministry tributes (Meg Lee Chin going Scarecrow on diff tribute is still one of the best covers I've ever heard) and so I bought this one. It's all metal bands trying to do Ministry, but really kind of sucks. These bands should be doing Slayer covers, not Ministry. They all lack the electronic wizardry to do anything like Ministry, so they try with grind-core, metal guitars and double bass drums.I would not have bought if I had heard it first. But if you like heavy-metal, you might like this tribute."
5,A CD To GET To SUPPORT THE AHC,"AHC is the best band on this cd. theirs no doubt about that that the newest signees to american recordings are the best on this cd. trepanation, their indy release is 20000000 times better than that cover. thats their only cover that they have ever done. LOOK for War of Art to drop july 28 2001"
3,Ho Hum,So So popcorn from someone who lived on popcorn for 2 semsters of college.Just didn't have all that much flavor
3,FEATS OF CHEMISTRY IN COUNTRY LAB STRAIN CREDULITY,"GREEN HAS A BIG COW COUNTRY FOLLOWING. IN OTHER BOOKS HE TELLS OF VIRTUOSO PERFORMANCES IN AUCTION HOUSES, BRUSHY PASTURES, AND SMALL TOWNS WITH FIRST MONDAY HORSE SALES. NOW WE FIND GREEN ALL GROWN UP AND WORKING IN WEST TEXAS AS A VET. WITH LABORATORY EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE DURING WORLD WAR II, HE ANALYSES NOXIOUS WEEDS, FINDS SPECIFICALLY TOXIC SUBSTANCES, AND COMPOUNDS CURES RIGHT THERE. THIS IS PROBABLY NOT POSSIBLE WITH TODAY'S RESOURCES, SO THE ACCOUNTS IN THIS BOOK DO NOT RING TRUE TO ME. I'VE WORKED CATTLE IN A BRUSHY COUNTRY AND I'VE DONE SOME ORGANIC CHEMISTRY AND THE MORE I READ OF GREEN'S DOINGS, THE MORE SKEPTICAL I BECOME. I THINK GREEN MAY HAVE WORKED US TEXAS BOYS THE WAY CARLOS CASTENADA WORKED HIPPIES."
2,OCR prossess destroyed the value of this book,"I am glad there are machines that can reproduce books so cheaply. This prosses will preserve many wonderful litterary works. Alas, the pure mechanical reproduction of this book was a disaster. This prosses has removed many valuable illustrations. The index is a jumbled unreadable mess. Some value could be restored if the publisher would make a new table of contents."
2,Very Disappointed,"I've been wanting to have this perfume again, for a long time. I've been doing alot of searching on Amazon, they had it!I haven't used this in years, I loved it back in the 80s. When this arrived I was so happy, as soon as I put it on and smelled it, it was so not like the ""original"". I would know the ""original"" scent in a heartbeat! I don't know if this is ""something else"" or what. I will say it was shipped before sch. and packaged very well."
5,Favorite frag.,"Lauren by Ralph Lauren for Women 1.0 oz Eau de Toilette SprayThis is my absolute favorite fragrance and has been for over 20 years. I had a hard time finding it for a bit in the 90's thank goodness thats over. This is a very fresh clean smell with very light floral notes. For someone who wants that; just out of the shower scent with a femminine slant. I love this particular Eau de Toilette one ounce as it fits easily into a small purse or travel bag. Most parfums out there don't offer something this handy.For instance, I'm very fond of Le Du Temps also but I've never found a parfum container to travel with."
5,a gift for my mother,"My mother is almost 80 years and the top of alhzaimer ... This year and prior to his illness worsens, I would like something that reminds you the best of its past ... she always was an elegant woman who liked the good perfumes ... and her favorite ... Lauren ... I do not know if next year will be with me but that this year I want to see your face when you open your gift at Christmas ... thank you for giving me such joy ..greetings.boni"

4,great no matter what people say!,"This is probably the lowest rated Lone Justice/Maria Mckee album and that type of publicity kept me from buying it even though I've been a Mckee fan for quite awile. All you ever here is how it doesn't compare to the first one and how she can't find a good enough band. Finnally after hearing all her other stuff for so long I needed something new so I picked up Shelter. Then after listening I came to the conclusion that it doesn't matter who or what is backing up Maria Mckee, her music and sound is always amazing! So for all you buyers out there, if you love Maria Mckee this album is a must have. So maybe it's not as original or ground-breaking as Lone Justice's debute but who cares as long as I get to hear Maria sing! The same goes for her third solo release ""Life is Sweet""."
3,About half is supreb but the whole can't match the debut,"Two years after their amazing debut, Lone Justice returned for their final studio album. While about have of the songs here are excellent, the rest are a bit uneven and the overall result is one that can't live up the standards of the remarkable debut.""I Found Love"" opens the album with lead singer Maria McKee and her incredible voice. The song rocks with an intensity to match the spiritual awakening suggested in the lyrics. ""Shelter"" is a great midtempo ballad, while both ""Wheels"" and the gorgeous ""Dixie Storms"" are musts.The rest of the songs are something of a mixed bag that suffer in comparison to the four mentioned songs and all of the ones on the debut. A good album, but not one that should be in your collection without ""Lone Justice."""
3,Good Album,"Released in the late 80's, ""Shelter"" was the phoenix of the burgeoning LA punkabilly scene--Lone Justice' sprawling ambition jump-started the 'neo-traditionalist' movement in Nashville, giving rise to stars such as Dwight Yoakam and Patty Loveless. This CD, featuring the formidible pipes of lead vocalist Maria McKee, contains three terrific tunes: ""I Found Love,"" ""Shelter,"" and ""Don't Toss Us Away,"" (later a hit single for Loveless.) The rest of the CD is a period piece, but the best, despite it's dated, lush, synthesizer-laden arrangements, is bold and continues to influence."
5,I really enjoyed it and everything about it.,"Because I am so interested in the Civil War, and the years and events before and after it, I really loved this book. Gilbert Morris became one of my favorite authors when I first read the book Drummer Boy At Bull Run, and it intrigued me to read the rest of his books. I am just starting out on the House Of Winslow books, and I like them already."
3,Before and After,"The groundwork of this book does flow a little slow. Keep on reading because it is well worth it. Morris gives you a very good account of the life before and during the Civil War. There is a nice romance of the characters that tell the story. The author also gives you some of the history of the Winslow family. I think you will be looking for some of his other books. By Ruth Thompson author of the ""Natchez Above The River"""
5,I'd give it 10 stars if I could!,"Not 10 tips, not 30 tips, but 75 very doable and very attractive ways to preserve your children's art work. I can't believe it. Each of the 75 tips has photographs of sample projects, specific directions, and the exact list of what you need and where to get it. Not a bit of space is wasted in this terrific book. It's packed with great ideas and easy to follow instructions. Each project is as beautiful as a Martha Stewart craft, but uses supplies you can easily find and won't break your bank account. I already tried 3 and can't believe how easy it was. And I still have 72 more to go. It even solves the really tough problems like what to do with those first scribbles as well as three dimensional artwork. This book is a great find. I'm buying it as gifts for all my mommy friends as well as my children's teachers."
1,You could do without.,"This survey of 20th-century architecture with much pretension to critical analysis and expert knowledge is no more than a mythical dungeon of gobbledygook. Frampton's text has little if any power to communicate with the readers. As a matter of fact, his willingness to communicate with the readers is even more doubtful. This printed manuscript of jargon is so pretentious and confusing that no novice could make any pretensions to understanding of the book; and an aficiodano with expert knowledge of the subject could learn no more than he already knows by following this book's narrow path. Kenneth Frampton is reputed to be in the same league of writers such as Charles Jencks, Esther McCoy, Edward Ford, etc. The publication of this book has certainly done him no justice."
5,A must for every architecture student,This is THE architecture history book for anyone interested in going beyond the historic facts into the thoughts of the architecture master
3,uhh... only good for graduate students,"I took the first year architecture history in community college. Frampton's book is extreme. This book is absolutely not a choice for beginers in architecture history. It is not the pleasant experience to read Frampton's book. I doubt whether it is necessary for the author to use such not understandable writing style. In average, I read about three times in order to understand what he is talking about VAGUELY! However, it is no doubt that this book is considered as the classic (or the Bible) of architecture history. Frampton made a lot (A LOT!) comparison of enormous archtiects from different eras and different parts of the world. According most practicing architects, it is the best arch history book you could read (only if you are knowledgable enough in the field)By the way, if you are interested in a visual architecture history book, this is not you choice. All the illustration in this book is all white & black, small.Hope this commend help!"
4,More pictures please.,"A cannonical book, but sadly only really educational if you know all about these buildings. If you didn't, the black & white, thumbnail size pictures doesn't help. Could someone republish this book with full-size photos and diagrams? I'll read it all over again!"
4,"Excellent, concise text: Yet not for beginners.","Kenneth Frampton's history of modern architecture is a terrific and scholarly book, highlighting all the important architects and styles of this century. Yet this book is not recommended as a beginner's guide to architecture. Frampton relates the various works to other architects and artists of the past and in recent years. His deep knowledge of art/architectual history is expressed throughout the book and can scare of readers without the background. I, myself, who has studied a good deal of art/architectual history, find myself befuddled now and then. Basically, I understand about 2/3 of the references and the other 1/3 I either have to pass on, or due further reasearch. It takes effort, but what you learn along the way is fascinating!"
3,Does this book come in english?,"This book may have some excellent insights to modern architecture, but it's not for everyone. Kenneth Frampton is very well respected in the academia world. There is a possibility that he is brilliant and very well educated but his book is difficult to read. He packed his writing with a lot of information but I had to read everything two or three times because of another reason. His writing style must be an english teacher's nightmare. All of his sentences were run-on sentences. He wrote whole paragraphs using single sentences. I picked a sentence out of random and counted seventy nine words. As most wise english teachers preach, keep sentences short and simple."
5,The Dore's Illustrations for Dante's Commedia are great.,"The Illustrations from the 1st canto in the Inferno to the last of Paradiso are great because they help as a visual aid when reading the Divina Commedia. One can really see how and in which ways Dore, when he design the illustrations, followed the text very closely."
5,Dore Illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy,This is an exceptional book. It contains inspiring illustrations of scenes described by Dante in his epic work: The Divine Comedy. I feel that Dore's artwork is just as epic as Dante's poetry. I am fully satisfied with this book.
5,AWWWWWWWWWWW YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!,Absolutely perfect! These pictures capture the essence and feel of the Divine Comedy perfectly. These are the kinds of scenes that went through my mind while I read. What captured my attention the most were the plates of Puragatory. Nobody else could have caught the mood more accurately. Dore and Dante are both gensises.
4,Good cable,"Good cable for the price. As noted by other users, its snagless design can make removing the plugs difficult, and the plastic jacket is easy to harm. Although, neither of these should be of any real problem for everyday use."
3,Belkin A3L791,"Cable does the job, albeit it isn't the quality type. One can easily see the marks made on the cable if it got twisted/bented; otherwise its good for easy/permanent use."
1,wrong color can't tell blue from grey,"I NOT GONNA accept what these people want to give me,I'm paying so send what I order or just return my money..I'LL GO TO BEST BUY OR WALMART SOME PLACE THAT WILL GET THINGS RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.PLEASE PEOPLE AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COST."
5,Great,I loved this product. Use this product with the adapter and you'll be fully satisfied (and save hundreds of dollars).
3,"Good price, don't like the design of the snagless ends","It's a CAT 5e cable at a very competitive price. It works. But I really dislike the design of the snagless cable ends used here. I've worked with a lot of different cabling over the years, and I really dislike this style. If you are going to plug the cable into two devices and leave them there, you'll be fine. But if you find yourself moving the plugs between devices (or ports on the same device) even a few times, you will find this design to be a hassle."
1,GC,Led to believe that it was shellfish free - when in fact it contains shellfish. Had to return for that reason.
3,"Excellent overview, beatiful illustrations","I recommend this book primarily for those wanting a good overview of a very long period of time and for the beautiful pictures, many of which are in colour. However, especially for the periods before 1500, there often are simply not enough illustrations to accurately portray the changes in fashion during these years, and the text tends to focus on French fashion almost exclusively. I've also discovered errors in descriptions of styles by as much as a century and a half--best to ignore the text and make your own analysis based on the illustrations themselves, which are all contemporary sources, not modern interpretations or redrawing. A very good resource book for any costume library."
3,"Good pictures, bad text",This book is a great source for pictures but the text is not as useful. It is more anthropological than historical and has been translated from French so is sometimes unclear.
5,Promoting and Encouraging those Innovative Ideas,"This book offers valuable data and processes to promote innovation and creativity in the workplace. This book builds from the first book ""Ideas Are Free,"" in which it defines serendipity and further illustrates what steps a company should and needs to do in order to retrieve ideas from the front-line and sustain idea flow. I originally bought this book for a class I took with the author (Creating a High Performance Organization through Employee Ideas). If you ever have the opportunity to take a class with Robinson, I highly recommend it. However, his book does give valuable insight into idea innovation and gives confidence to managers who are adaptable to change."
3,"Good insight, but goes on too long","The book really helps illustrate the ""mystery"" of creativity, and most helpfully outlines strategies for squeezing more of it out of any organisation. But the whole thing could have been more effectively boiled into a 10-page journal article. These guys were scratching around to make a whole book out of it."
2,"Quite entertaining, not meant as a ""how to""","The book is good for readability and wide ranging examples of creativity in action. But I found its gee-whiz diagnoses of why and how creativity occur are superficial. OK for a weekend reading and maybe idea generation, but not of much practical use."
2,Kind of disappointing,I was disappointed at the lack of practical suggestions and techniques. This book seems to want to inspire without giving specific practical tools and techniques on how to do it. This is not the book for me. I'll keep looking.
3,Bonita e inspiradora historia,"Una novela que relata la desesperación en que tuvieron que vivir los primeros cristianos para defender su fe, situación que nos lleva a valorar la libertad actual."
3,"Falls short of expectations, missing images","There is a reason this book is so cheap. I am going to say the other book from Rotovision ""photographing people; portraits, fashion, glamour"" is a much better book overall. This book has fairly tame nudes, and is missing one or two images it has diagrams for, most notably 'marie' on page 43. It is really boring and there are enough ringflash shots that by the time you see the 4th one, you are ready to tear those pages out.It lacks creativity, and the set ups are often duplicated with a different model and different photographer form a slight change in angle, so you have loads of filler. Probably a good book if you are a guy with a camera looking to be taking nudes and replicating stale images.The manipulation pages are a waste, they tell you nothing and there are only a few of them."
4,Good book to understand how to illuminate,"I like this book because you can learn how to illuminate a body. I think is a good book, but some of the pictures are bored and they have no force, otherwise it will be a really good book with 5 stars.Its just a book to know how to lighting, not to see really good pictures, it is by your own."
1,Cannot Review What You Do Not Receive!,"I ordered this on 6/26/05, it's 07/28/05 and I still have Not received it!!! I do believe this a long, long ordering process."
4,Raulin,"Well, I agree that Raulin's voice sounds a little different, but this album is very good. This cd is not his best nor the worst, just listen to "" Que pasa con nicolasa"" and you will hear pure quality. So, I do not know what cd you listend to.Raulin es uno de los mas pegado ahora mismo."
5,Quality supplement,"This book by Iron Crown is a quality addition to the middle earth roleplaying world - it combines excellent material with an easily understandable, logical presentation pattern. I personally find Mirkwood the most fascinating area of Middle Earth, and to be able to acts within it is great fun. Dwarf, elf or hobbit; no character should be without a bit of first hand experience under the portentious bowers of this ancient forest. If you only buy one supplement for the MERP game system, this should be it!"
3,it was great for class.,the book was great for class. Not at all practical in the Wiccan world outside class. It was alright not my first choice.
4,my anthropology 121 class,"Firstly, the price was excellent, less than half of what the college bookstore's price was. The condition of the book was as described, like new. Though I did get my order within the seller's estimated arrival time(3 weeks), it seemed to take a little longer than other orders that were out of state also. Thats because I really needed it for class and did get it within two weeks, its all good now."
5,Anthropology of religion,I was very pleased with the purchase. It was in the exact condition it was said to be in. I also recieved it in a very timely manner. Over all I was extremely pleased. I bought the book because im going to be going to school for anthropology so I want to get a head start.
5,Interesting and informative,"This book is great for first-time anthropology students; it teaches basic as well as advanced concepts without seeming overly preachy or didactic. Its ethnographic examples focus mainly on so-called ""primitive"" societies, and allows the discerning reader to visualize the supernatural world time and time again through their eyes. A fantastic read!"
5,"Well written, easy to understand Anthropology book","This book is very easy to understand and gives excellent insight into religion, magic and witchcraft. Professor Stein, the author, was my professor when I took this class and she has thorough knowledge of the subject. I would read the book even if I hadn't taken the class."
3,Good Story with Flaws,"I don't mean to be disrespectful, given the film's import to Muslims, however as a film I found that it was lacking. The story has some gaping holes, which make it almost unbelievable that such a journey could take place. Physically driving from France to Mecca would be a major undertaking. This story is somewhat of a fairy tale in that the obstacles which are encountered all seem to have morals. I also would have like to have understood more about what is happening in Mecca. I think there could have been more explanation built into the story to explain that. I very much enjoyed seeing a film with this theme, I hope there are more."
5,Middle School Son Loved this Book,"My middle school aged son picked this book to read for a book report. He's somewhat of a reluctant reader so it can be a challenge to find a book that really draws him in. This book did it! It's the story of a 6th grade boy, named Tyler, who is visiting an uncle who writes for a popular sitcom. Tyler feels that this is his chance to break into showbiz. The author of the book has been a television writer so I'm sure it's an accurate description of life behind the scenes."
1,Demo CD Rom,"Actually, the book is probably great. However, I gave it one star solely to alert consumers to the fact that the CD that comes with the book is just a 30 free trial. I guess this means the whole CD vanishes after that period of time?. Don't know yet.The brushes are nothing short of outstanding. Too bad I can only use them for 30 days. Nothing can be saved, and I am not computer savy enough to convert the CD to a permanent status in my computer. ..."
2,In some ways seriously out-dated,"The first 7 chapters of this book were wonderful, even tear invoking. However, after the chapter on rhythms, it was all down hill. I was so disappointed to read the section on co-sleeping. I also realize that the book was written a decade ago, however the information regarding the length of time to breastfeed was sad. Here is what the World Health Organization has to say about the length of time for breastfeeding, it is a quote directly from their website. ""exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life is the recommended way of feeding infants, followed by continued breastfeeding with appropriate complementary foods for up to two years or beyond."" In the book she is advocating the baby be weaned BY one year of age. Very sad. I would recommend this book for the first few chapters but after that, toss it aside, or resell it or let someone else read it. WARN them that other information in it is NOT up to date."
2,Doesn't work with Mac,I only have access to a macintosh computer and the cable software is only available for PC-compatible machines. Samsung does not offer a Mac download on their website either.
4,Stands up to beach side abuses.,"After burning through a number of vacuums with beach sand, I asked a few professional housekeepers what to get. Panasonic was top choice (its something to do with the motor, I guess). It's sturdy, light enough to maneuver easily, and the canister saves a lot on the cost of bags. No hinky extras, hoses, attachments, etc to get lost, broken, or weigh the unit down. Extra long cord is genius. One star off for its plastic body, though for the price, I'm not all that concerned."
3,Vacuum Cleaner,"Moves easily, but front cover pops off every time it hits a piece of furniture & filter falls out. Long cord is great, but no attachements makes another vacuum possibly a better choice. My husband says that dirt going around motor is the reason his last Panasonic lasted 20 years, so we expect this to do the same."
2,"No way to vacuum in corners, etc...","I like the vacuum but it has one drawback - unfortunately, its a big drawback. There are no attachments for it & you are unable to unattach the hose so there is no way to vacuum in corners and around the edge of the room."
4,Great TV,"I bought this HDTV in 04 and have been in love with it ever since. DVD's look awesome with progressive scan and HD cable looks so clear it feels like you are there when using component cables and 1080i. I recently purchased an XBox 360, which outputs every game in 1080i. Once again it looks great. Sorry PS2, the TV only has 2 component inputs so I can't have this plugged in anymore. I have not had any problems. The reasons I am giving this HDTV 4 out of 5 stars are the lack of 720p and 1080p display, only 2 component inputs, no HDMI input, and a DVI input that seems is not compatible with anything I own. If you only have one or two HD electronics this is the TV for you."
4,"Expensive but worth it,","Truly low rise, even under your most daring jeans. Sheer and very light so they don't add bulk. As an added bonus, they air dry *really* quicly after washing (so they're _great_ for travel!). Taking off one star b/c the seams don't always stay flat."
1,Un-professional,Strength was not close to as advertised by mfg. More frills than substance. Not a top travel harness choice.
4,Practical - easy to understand guide,"One of the better books I've read on the subject of starting a label. Simple, easy to understand, worth the time."
5,Tons of info!,"If you are looking for tons of information involved in the world of fashion business, this is a great book. It's kind of long, but for the most part it gets to the point of things and it offers great suggestions and a way of doing things. I found the charts and diagrams and spreadsheets in the book to be most helpful. The help you get a leg up on things so that you don't have to create your own. It's worth the read if your thinking about starting your own fashion business!"
4,"great tips, distracting mistakes","While far better than The Fashion Designer Survival Guide, this book is rampant with just as many (if not more) spelling, grammar and syntax errors which can be quite distracting. I mean, how hard would it have been to get a proof-reader?The information in the book still makes it a hands-down best choice."
5,The Fashion Business Bible,"I feel that if you are thinking about starting out in the apparel business, this book is essential for ensuring that you are not caught completely off-guard by the starting-your-own-line Tornado.I wish I had this book 4 months ago to avoid the tons of wasted dollars on the silly mistakes I made. the content is absolutely priceless and I would recommend everyone to just check it out before you make the great leap into starting your own business in fashion."
5,So fun and a great way to sweat!,"I read the overwhelmingly postive reviews on Amazon and decided to take a chance on this DVD. My husband and I are so glad I did. We work out together almost every night and have both enjoyed the simple-yet-fun choreography and the instructor's positive attitude and funny, encouraging comments. We were literally both grinning the whole time we tried the workout, and we laughed out loud several times at Marc Santa Maria's funny cueing and comments delivered in a slighty sing-song tempo to match the dance/music, ""Where's your booty? Over there."" ""You're cool when you're dancin'."" After 3 or 4 times, we had the routine down and had enjoyed every workout, which felt more like a fun dance lesson. The other great thing? You FEEL THIS in your thighs and core and work up a respectable sweat. If you're just looking for a fun, quick shot of cardio to liven up your workout routine, this is the answer. Great price, too."
4,Entertaining account of an important voyage,"I enjoyed the very British humor of this author in describing his historic singlehanded around-the-world sail. A nice balance of description, technical information, and personal revelation."
3,Worth reading with A Long Way & Sea of Dreams,"Knox Johnson tells a good tale, and it's worth reading. But you have to wonder at his seamanship sometimes. He might have swapped the brandy for water and maybe tried a lifeline when he went overboard to fix a leak in mid-ocean. One also wonders whether some of his mishaps might have been man made. Makes a good companion to Bernard Moitessier's Long Way. No denying the courage and determination.He now runs the Around Alone race and another book worth reading is Sea of Dreams about the 2002 race. There were 3 Americans and 2 Canadians in the race and the book focusses on them and the Canadian Derek Hatfield who was rolled over in a hurricane at the Horn and lived to tell the tale. terrific stuff. As good as Godforsaken Sea, I think."
3,A Really Good Read if Accompanied by Other Books,"This is a quaint read. I picked it up after reading Peter Nichol's ""A Voyage For Madmen"" which provides an outstanding overview of all the men in this first-non-stop-solo-around-the-world race. Knox-Johnson waxes poetic about his extraordinary accomplishment, which, of course, he is entitled to do. There is no doubt he possessed the temperment to embark on this voyage. His skills, however, might be viewed as a bit lacking. Nevertheless, he shares his thoughts, adventures, and, on occaision, his shortcomings that occurred during this voyage. As well, there is an underlying psychological drama that unfolds as you make your way through this book. I recommend reading this book, but strongly recommend you read it only after you have read ""A Voyage for Madmen"" simply because it will be much more informative and provide better insight into Knox-Johnson."
4,No nonsense sailing account,"This was a very interesting read about world solo sailing. I would have liked even more technical details, but compared to others I've read this excellent. A remarkable and worthy effort to say the least."
5,Pastulio's Review,"I myself have never been a big manga buyer, but after reading the first volume of Priest, I was hooked. Priest concerns the story of Ivan Isaacs, a fallen priest who has sold half hid soul to the devil Belial to exact revenge on Temozarela, a fallen archangel who seeks to turn all of humanity to the darkness. Hyung's style of drawing is a refreshing change from the usual style of Manga, and the Wild West setting is a perfect back drop for Ivan's battle with Temozarela and his 12 disciples. The best part is that Hyung has mixed in gunplay and battles with the right amount of story line so as to make worth every penny you spend for the others...This is a must read for all lovers of Hellsing!"
4,It works and is of a useful length,"This is a good quality cable from a well-known vendor in a useful length at a fair price. I have no regrets from ordering a pair of these to serve as extra cables for use when needed at away meeting.Update: It has served me well for over 5 years, and its snagless design is still better than a newer Cat 6 cable I just reviewed for the Amazon Vine program (Micra Digital CAT6 Snagless Patch Cable; Black (10 Feet))"
4,Not the Best,"Ladder says in big text on the ladder WEIGHT LIMIT 225lb. No where it says that on Amazon.I am 275Lb and it has not given me any problems. I did stand on it for a while at my own risk seeing if it would break.I do not recommend this is you are over the weight limit, the quality really doesn't seem to be safe even at 225Lbs."
4,Beautiful book,"Lovely tiny book with absolutely gorgeous illustrations from real medieval books of hours, with jewel tones and lovely compositions. The binding should be different to allow it to more easily open fully."
2,no audio CD,"I selected this product because it was supposed to come with an audio CD. However when I received it from Amazon there was no CD included. When I contacted Amazon, they apologized and said it was no longer available from the distributer (so I'm suprised to still see it advertised with the CD on this site). I ended up ordering it direct from McGraw-Hill (with the CD). This is my first disappointing experience with AMazon, but I'd recommend you save yourself the hassle (and extra shipping) and order it direct from McGraw-Hill.As for the product itself, it would help to have a pretty good background in Spanish grammar before starting, since it is a bit strangely organized. Overall, it's a good start to learning medical Spanish."
2,Not want I expected,"I was looking for a book with phrases and commonly used medical terms, that also included a CD. I flipped through this book after I received it and appeared more like a high school workbook. There were translation exercises. I'm an ER nurse and writing spanish is not what I really need. Consider carefully what you need before purchasing. I am returning it and buying ""On Target: Spanish for Healthcare Providers"". Hopefully this one will be better."
1,Cellet Case,"Very cheap looking, not durable. I actually sent this product back.I was very dissappointed.V. Thomas"
4,kids love the kitchen,"I got a good deal on this kitchen on ebay so my expectations were probably not as high. The kitchen was a little bit of a pain to put together, not difficult but took a while. My 2 and 3 year old boys have enjoyed it so far and although they are rough it had endured fine for several months. As others have mentioned, the inside of the oven is small (which hasn't bothered the boys yet) and doesn't stay closed (I put small felt furniture pads on either side of the door and it is functional now). Our kitchen doesn't make water sounds, but the other ones are loud and clear."
4,One Happy Mom,"I have read all the reviews but in my house this toy is a very big hit. My two year old and her friends love it. She likes to pretend to cook and feed us her ""meals"" all the time. The door to the stove doesn't stay shut all the time but that is not really a big deal when my daughter is constantly playing with it anyway. I would definitely recommend this toy to anyone."
3,Good kitchen that requires little space,"I researched a lot of different kitchens for our two year old son. We wanted something that was durable but didnt take up too much space and didnt go over our budget. We narrowed it down to this one and the Little Tykes Interactive Fun kitchen and chose this one since our Toys R Us store only had the MagiCook one. I also liked how the MagiCook kitchen had other accessories that go with it that will interact with the kitchen. Altogether, I am satisfied with this kitchen. My son loves to play with it. It wasnt too difficult to put together. My only complaints are that the oven door is flimsy and we have a hard time closing it sometimes and the switch for the language selector is in plain sight so my son constantly switches it. I also enjoy the fact that there isnt pink on this kitchen, it is green, white, blue and purple, so it is appropiate for both girls and boys. Overall, if you are on a budget and have limited space, this is a good kitchen."
2,Not what I expected from Little Tykes,"For one, my kitchen didn't look the same as the one in the picture. It was different...didn't have the oven that you see...not really similar at all...but it DOES speak English French and Spanish. Two of the doors, we don't close, because they don't fit in the grooves right and the kids little hands can't get them open. The kids enjoy cooking on the stovetop and hearing it talk and that's about it...I might have sent it back except my order got messed up and they gave it to me for free. I definately wouldn't have paid 90.00 for it."
4,My 3-year old loves it!!!,"My 3-year old boy was adamant about wanting a kitchen from Santa. I purchased this at a local store, then read previous reviews on this website and was getting buyer's remorse. We decided to put it together and see what happened. My husband put it together alone on Xmas eve while I worked on other toys. He said if you followed the directions and used your brain it wasn't bad at all, and it looked great. Yes, it's a little small, but perfect for our small family room. My boys both love it. Santa was very generous, but this was the only toy they played with all Xmas morning until we left for dinner at a relative's house, and again all evening when we returned. I can see where it might be a little small for the older children, but for our house & the age of my boys, it's perfect."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. I was so surprised at the quality for Little tykes. It has no storage and the refridgerator door would not stay closed. I think it should cost half of what it does. I purchased the Step Two kitchen when my daughter was three, and it is way better by far."
1,Flimsy!,I never even got the whole kitchen put together before deciding to return it. It was falling apart as I was assembling it. It will be going back and replaced with a kitchen of higher quality!
2,not what we expected,The base is rounded so its not sturdy. it knocks over easy. the sounds are very low. if there is any noise you can't hear. the oven is just a slit for the cookie sheet so you cant put anything else in it. the oven door falls open and wont stay shut. i am taking it back and getting a more durable kitchen. the sounds are cute and idea/concept is cute but the design needs more work.
2,Disappointed,"We just got this kitchen set this weekend, and I am disappointed enough to try to warn others of it. The assembly was no problem...what is a huge problem is the fact that the oven is 2 inches tall inside. I kept thinking maybe we built it wrong, but have decided that is how big it is. Needless to say, you can't put anything in it! I don't know what the point of having an ""interactive"" oven is, if none of the food can even fit in it! Another problem...the interactive part of this kitchen is a joke! There are 17 of the foods that work (as if a child can choose which will make a noise out of the other 50 that will not). The definition of ""interactive"" on this toy...when you put a specific piece of food on top of the stove top (none will fit inside the stove) a little voice will say, ""Yum! Eggs!"" That's it. Very disapppointing!"
3,Okay for price I paid,"I bought this for less than third of its original price on (...) and the product looked good as new so I don;t have too much to complain. IT might be small but I thought it wasn't over bearing in any room, went beautifully with any decor and was still hours of fun!"
3,Keep Looking,"If you are interested in this kitchen because you would like to expose your children to new languages, I would keep looking. My goal was to expose my daughter to French, but the quality of the voice is so poor that I can barely understand what is being said in English! The quality of the construction is fine but, frankly, you're paying for the added bonus of the languages and it simply isn't worth it. I would recommend looking for a regular kitchen, whose design you like, and finding another way to introduce language."
2,Not What I'd Hoped,"Generally, I love all of the Little Tikes toys. This kitchen was not what I'd hoped, though. The refrigerator and cabinet doors don't close. They look tacky/messy hanging open all the time. The opening in the oven is too small for my daughter to put food into to ""cook."" The oven door is difficult to close so it, too, hangs open most of the time. The talking stove would be neat if the voice was more clear.My daughter does use the kitchen.... but I wish I'd picked a different one."
2,WISH I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE BARBIE KITCHEN,"I WISH I WOULD HAVE READ THE OTHER REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT BEFORE GOING TO GREAT LENGTHS TO GET IT FOR MY 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS. I TOO AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SMALL STORAGE AREAS, OUR FRIDGE DOOR WILL NOT CLOSE EITHER, AND I AM VERY UPSET AT THE SMALLNESS OF THE ""OVEN"". I DON'T KN0W ABOUT ANYONE ELSE BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD ""100 PHRASES"" COME OUT OF THIS THING AND DO NOT LIKE THAT YOU HAVE TO TURN THE KNOB TO GET IT TO WORK. THE MAIN REASON I PRESSED SO HARD TO GET THIS ONE WAS FOR THE ""100 PHRASES"" AND IF SANTA HADN'T BROUGHT IT BEFORE MOMMY TRIED IT OUT - IT WOULD BE RETURNED IN A HEARTBEAT..."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this cook set for my 2 yr old little boy for Christmas, he was so excited. He couldn't wait for it to be put together so we sat down and went to work and didn't get very far. There was no stickers or screws at all. Talk about a very disappointed little boy on Christmas morning. As you can imagine I was too. So we never got to see how any of it worked. I would not recommened anyone to buy this toy."
2,Just a So So Toy,"My parents bought this for our 3 year old daughter for her birthday last September. After reading the review from Little Tikes we were impressed and thought this would be a great investment. It is true about being compact and yes our daughter does play with it but I'm not impressed. It took my mother and sister in law about 45 min to put it together. The biggest disappointment is that the only ""noise"" it makes is very difficult to hear and understand. Those noises only come from the 2 burners on the top when you turn the knobs. The phone, the sink, the molded in ice maker, the BIG 2"" space in the useless oven, and anything else on the kitchen is ""just for looks"". I do feel this was a waste of my parents $100 considering our little one will play with it less than 15 min then move on to something else. My suggestion is look for a better item....."
2,not worth the money,"We bought this for our daughter for her 4th birthday. Needless to say we were not thrilled with the finished product. As the others said it took forever to put it together, the doors don't stay shut, and the spaces are so small. You can't do much with the sink, oven, or shelves. My daughter likes it so I guess that is a plus but it was definatly not worth the almost $100.00 (with tax). If I could we would take it back but my daughter wants to keep it."
3,Changed my mind - not shiny as on picture,"I am returning this because I was expecting more a shiny finish, like on the picture. The product was a bit matte, and after looking at the first plate, I did not unpack the rest and just decided to return the set. However, I must say that for those who are looking for light and everyday use, these could be very good. They might scratch a bit ? .. But I don't know since I did not use them. I am still looking for a lighter, more portable dinnerware then the earthenware so commonly marketed these days (which is so heavy!). I think that fine porcelain might be the only way to go ! You only live once, I guess :)"
4,Pure Cowboy,This is a magical look into the music & Poetry of one of Texas's most knowledgeable cowboys. We are invited into his home to enjoy the words and music of himself and his band The Boys in the Bunkhouse. If you enjoy cowboy music played the way it should be you will love this DVD. With stories and explanations from Red himself the songs and poetry just flow well worth the price and a favorite in my DVD library.
3,Pretty good considering..........,"Pros: I enjoyed this DVD set because it included some interviews with Robert Bauval and Graham Hancock. There were also some pictures of the inside of the great pyramid that I had not seen before, and I have seen a lot.Cons: The music soundtrack is way too loud. This would not be a problem if there were a subtitle option. You end up cranking up the volume to make out what Bauval is saying over the music.In fine: Mostly old hat stuff, which will probably continue until someone replaces the village idiot Zahi Hawass and we finally get to open the door in the so called ""air shaft"".""so let it be written, so let it be done""Yul Brynner"
5,Fabulous!,"An excellent series, revealing new discoveries that indicate that a lot of what we've been told about the ancient world isn't exactly the truth. The experts who participate in this series have been working in this field for years, if not decades, and have learned some fascinating things. I highly recommend this series to anyone who's curious about the distant past."
2,Interesting piece,"I like the ""outside the box"" thinking that was presented but from a scientific stand point there weren't any actual facts presented. In fact the majority of the 5 episode series was spent with a camera shot from a moving vehicle, Google's world map, or CGI shot of the sky. I understand this idea is not accepted well, if at all, in the scientific community but it would have been nice to have some of the world's leading scientists in the fields that Carmen was talking about actually interviewed to get a feel of what they are thinking.In the end this seems like a piece to get her name out there, allow her to add some more book sales, and push a small, albeit interesting, idea in the name of science. There was little to no factual information or research presented or referenced during the 5 episode show which disappoints me.Watch it for what it is, great cinematography and a piece that makes you stop and go ""Is it possible?"""
2,Disappointing,"Although the subject matter of these lectures is extremely interesting, the DVD quality leaves a lot to be desired. I have watched the first two episodes so far and am totally put off. The female narrator is excellent, with a clear, pleasant voice and beautiful diction. However, the background music (the key word here is ""background"") is intolerably loud, to a level that it overpowers and drowns out the many expert commentators' voices, to a point where I missed probably half of what they had to say. Grrrrr! So frustrating! In addition, an older Egyptian who apparently grew up around the pyramids provides a lot of the commentary, but between his heavy accent and the loud music I couldn't understand half of whatever knowledge and wisdom he had to share. What a shame, since I was really looking forward to watching and hopefully learning from these DVDs. I'm going to stick with books!"
2,"Popular ""science""","Not much meat to this ""documentary""! Maybe interesting to first graders. Promising, but failed to achieve its presumed goal of actually presenting factual or academic-level information."
1,Quackery,"In short, a waste of time and a load of quackery designed to make a lot of money for the 'professor'. pseudo-science dressed up as the real thing. The other reviews have to be written in house. save your money."
2,Misrepresented,"This is not a 9.45 Ounce soap bar it is actually a 3.2 ounce. I am dissapointed, I do like the product my wife likes it too."
4,Not as advertised,"Not as advertised. It ounces described was for the total of 3 bars, yet it was described as that amount for each."
5,SO healthy and smells great!,"I have used this product for almost 40 years...the soap, LOVE the body splash in the summer, lotion, powder; it's all wonderful. The soap is made with Olive Oil and is wonderful for my skin and the beautiful fragrance is just an added bonus! I have some little sample bars stuck in lingerie drawers ;~)) Wal-Mart used to carry it but sadly, I can no longer find it there! You'll love it!"
5,best products,these soaps are the best soaps and very well traditional soaps from spain. very difficult to find in local stores.... the best
4,Didn't want to put it down,"I just finished reading ""Under the Cover of Darkness"". It was my introduction to a James Grippando novel. He has written a complicated yet easily understood novel about a busy attorney, Gus Whitley, who values his career over his family until his wife, Beth, disappears. He is left to take care of his six year old daughter and to make sense out of what could have happened to Beth. A serial killer is on the loose and we wait with baited breath to see if each murder will explain what happened to his wife. Grippando's prose style is crisp allowing the reader pick up the book and read as little or as much as time permits but always wanting to get back into the story. He uses interesting plot twists and turns to keep the pace moving. This book lends itself well to a reader with a busy schedule."
3,Great Beginning but that ending ......,"This book centers around, (yet another), serial killer on the loose in Washington state, the up and coming aggressive FBI agent assigned to the case and a high powered attorney whose wife goes missing during the killer's ""spree"". The first half of this book is excellent - suspense, humor (the book's introduction of the FBI agent is priceless), and empathy with the attorney as he comes to grip with his wife's disappearance,(suspicion, the press, police, ugly politics at his law firm), and dealing with his six year old daughter. I thought to myself this author has hit his stride. Unfortunately about mid-way events slow,... okay.... but then the conclusion .... Unsatisfying is an understatement and all the more disappointing after this book's start. This isn't a bad book - it just isn't the first one I'd pick up off the stack of ""Books to read"". The frustration to this reader was the excellent beginning paired with the less than so-so ending."
5,LOVED THIS BOOK,"Have enjoyed all of James Grippando books but this is the best so far. Great characters work together to try and find the wife of one of the main people in the story. There's many twists and turns and the reader travels through so many routes ,with the characters, until there is finally a solutin to all the plot questions.I'm always puzzled, after finishing one of his books, why Mr. Grippando isn't right up at the top of the charts where he belongs."
3,"Only three stars because of the hurried, implausible ending.","Really liked this book three-quarters of the way through. Then it fell flat, like a bad American movie...intriguing, to a point, but they had to finish it up quick so as not to go ""over budget."" I thought he'd tie the threads of the story together more convincingly, but he didn't, so I felt let down by the author when it all got jumbled up in an improbable story about cults and kidnapings and mass murder, blah, blah, blah. Books don't seem to be edited these days...just thrown out there without much thought to reader satisfaction. Makes you afraid to pick up a so-called ""best seller."" You just know it's all going to fall apart at some point. Why bother?"
3,Good suspense story...3.5 Stars,"This is one of the better suspense novels I've read recently. Not the best, but one of the better ones. Not wasting time, the author jumps right into the suspense that carries throughout the story. As the story moves along, you learn more about the characters and come to care for them and what happens. The various characters are likeable and for the most part, act in ways you would expect them to act. The author also reveals bits and pieces of the mystery throughout the storyline, giving you enough information to help you try to figure out what the outcome will be, but not enough to reveal everything too fast. And, a plot twist towards the end gave me an unexpected but much appreciated surprise.While the story was good and it kept my attention, it could have been better...maybe with a faster pace, and more tightly woven suspense. Despite this, I would still recommend this book."
1,Terrible,"This book was terrible. Let's start with the lead character Andie. If she wasn't whining about being mixed (Native American/White) she was being weak, silly and chasing after her boss, mind you she was getting married in the beginning of the book. The romance had no place in this book, it just took up extra space. You know a book is bad when the best character is the 6 year old. And the ending was ridiculous, I was angry I wasted by money."
3,Don't Knock It!,"I have not listened to this particular album, main reason being is that I cannot yet get hold of it. This was the reason for me being on this web page. I went to see Shane Richie in Boogie Nights the other week and I have to say it was the funniest show I have ever seen. Shane sang Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word - okay so he is no Frank Sinatra but he can sing and he can sing live. He is an entertainer, he doesn't pretend to be anything other than that. Many entertainers have released albums, some good and some not so good. For all those people who think they can do better, then I would like to see them try. Jealousy is a terrible thing - give the guy a break. When I finally manage to get a copy of this album then I will give you my honest and unbiased opinion. If anyone gets the chance to go and see the musical Boogie Nights go and see it, I guarantee you will enjoy it! Keep up the good work Shane!!!!!!"
4,Very pleased.,This is a very cute and functional serving cart. Just what I wanted and expected. I would order it again.
4,Looks great...handle difficult,"The cart matches my living room perfectly, but the handle doesn't fit together seamlessly. It still holds all of my bottles well."
4,"Not bad, but swap the cheap plastic casters for brass accent ones from a home supply box store","Arrived when promised. ~30 mins assembly. Instructions were decent. Wood finish is nice but a few blemishes/bumps in the upper & lower tray tops near the drilled assembly holes. I guess we'll try to mask them w\furniture crayon. ""Brass"" fittings under the rails are sorta cheesy plastic w\metallic coating like chrome parts from a model car kit. Still have to admit it presents nicely in the room."
1,Never received,"I ordered this item as a christmas gift for my mother. Although the site said it was in stock, it was not. I was never even informed about it not being in stock until after I waited and waited and finally emailed the seller. By the time I was told, it was too late to get my mother's gift for christmas.a"
2,Not reliable,"The cart is beautiful but the quality is not very high. The wheels stay on with just one dowel-like screw into the leg, which would be ok if it were not just a cheap wood with a veneer. So the wood is easily damaged by the screw. In the one I got, one of the legs was stripped and never tightened, even a little. I added some toothpicks to make the contact but then while I was wheeling it one day the wheel came off and everything spilled. I only gave it two stars because the other wheels have been ok, but the cart is pretty much worthless to me. Yes, I should have sent it back but I really needed it then and had to make it work."
5,AMAZON HAS IT ALL,"If ever you're looking for something... check with Amazon first, more than likely they will have it."
4,lots of promise,"This book is very entertaining, and it tells a lot about life on the stage. It has a slightly scifi spin, but that part really doesn't get going very strongly, yet, in my opinion. The characters are lively, and probably true to life. I really enjoyed the cast that was assembled and their first reading.I think the second book should be even better--once more science fiction is blended into the mix, as they travel through space to the different colonies and settlements."
3,Theatre folk take to the stars...,"An interesting, original premise, not often explored. Gets preachy on the politics and stereotypical (despite the obvious effort to avoid creating stereotypes in some areas). Extremely witty and enjoyable - I laughed aloud while reading it, and read both sequels."
3,Boring,"This is a rather boring book...I picked it up after a friend of mine recommended it to me. Although it only took 2-3 to read it, it was boring. It took all I had to actually get through it. The writing is easy enough-but just in a vocabulary and level sense. My younger sisters and brother could read it with no problems. It's just that there's no real good flow.What Elizabeth experienced was harrowing, and one of the reason why she's home is because of all the media coverage..."
5,Brain-shredding shards of abstraction,"Ben (the author of this DVD) and his colleagues were mainstays of the SF party/club scene from around '95 until about '04. During that time, they not only developed their highbrow style of digital abstract video installation art, but they also worked hard to build up the west coast's community of visualists. We were sad to see them go, but since moving on to international enagagements, Ben has released this DVD of his collected animated works. Every track except for the first is in high definition, and most tracks are tightly synched with the tasty idm sound. Without the sound, they're suitable for VJ mixing. The quality is universally high, and the Ben's unmistakable breakup style asserts itself in every track. There are no hippy screensavers here!"
3,Greg Hasting's Paintball Max'ed,"If you are expecting this game to stack up to the Xbox / Playstation versions, you are mistaken. The concept is similiar, but it is lacking the ability to direct team members and manage an overall team strategy."
1,Save your money -- Big Disappointment,"There was nothing new in/on this tape that wasn't covered in 9 Steps to Fiancial Freedom and Courage to be Rich. If you really want a tape of Suze Orman's that is useful and worth every penny, I recommend You've Earned It, Don't Lose It. You've Earned It gives solid financial advice where this tape answers no ""money"" questions.Combine You've Earned It with Eight Steps to Seven Figures and you will be getting some good financial advice.The basic theme of this tape was be pure of heart, pure of mind, and pure in intent and your mind will be clear to concentrate on making money. Ah-huh."
3,Would've,"I really wanted to read a book on Jeffrey Dahmer and this was one of the few available publications. Though it is very informative, it loses a little because of poor editing. I don't normally catch things like that, but this book had enough that it was noticeable. One problem was the work ""had"" was replaced by ""bad"" in many places throughout the book. I guess they did a spell check, but no one ever proof read the manuscript. The other problem is that the book is obviously a rush job to get on the market first. The bad cut and past photos they worked into the middle of the book are grainy and terrible looking. Also the story was written well before Dahmer meets his end in prison. It would have been nice to get that part in the book. Maybe there will be a revised edition one day. This is a decent history of Dahmer, but it is not perfect."
3,"""judgement"" not quite up to expectations","I found this movie very long, and not overly compelling. My son and I love old movies, and I thought that this would be a great one, combining history with Spencer Tracy - however, we could barely sit through it all. I watched the miniseries with Alec Baldwin, and found it fascinating - I assumed this movie would be on a par with the miniseries. Such was not the case - unless you're an insomniac, you might want to skip this one."
1,got robbed,"Could not watch dvd as its format is for Australia and I will not change my player as I did not order an Australian DVD. Got taken, but will not happen again as this seller is on my crap list."
1,Wrong Region...,"I live in Region 1...the U.S.A.. Not Region 2. Was very disappointed.The cover was very handsome. I did not check for the region.DO NOT purchase if you live in the U.S.A.!!! In Lakewood, Colorado"
1,Bad Cd,"The above CD will not play in my machine,due to it being for out of this country players.If I can return same,please advise.Judgement at Nurmembeg."
2,Would not play on DVD player.,When ordering I did not realize that the DVD was set up for region 2 and my DVD player only plays those for region 1. Hence I could not play it on my DVD player. I did get to see it by putting it on my computer. That was very disappointing. Other than that it was ok.
3,Overlong,"The movie is 3 hours long, which is just too much for a courtroom drama. Further, the subject matter may have been quite striking in 1961, but not that much in the early 21st century after so many films about the Holocaust have been produced. Anyway, be prepared for a long 3 hours of talking. BTW, there is one striking feature to this movie, and that is the appearance of a disfigured Montgomery Clift in it (that unfortunate car crash really ruined his face)."
1,Way overpriced!,There was nothing special about this release of the movie except that it was 36.95! Didn't even have a nicer case!
4,So CUTE!!!,"This little guy is very, very cute and his face is very detailed. He is of good, heavy material and a nice size. Much nicer than anything I could locate locally. He greats everyone who visits my home from his location on the porch but he would also look good in the garden. He is just so lovely I didn't want to hide him in the plants but wanted him where everyone could admire him. My only disappointment is that he isn't made in the US but in China (which is why I only gave him 4 stars)."
1,Total Pack of Lies,"Blatant attempt by this partisan republican to attack the democratic party and blame them for voter fraud, to cover up the fact that the 2000 and 2004 elections were outright stolen via intimidation, disenfranchisement and electronic voting machines, all designed to prevent minorities, poor people and young people from voting. Disgusting and nasty politics, not journalism."
1,"Biased, unsupported attack on Democratic party","This book is another example of the Republican Party attack strategy. Say anything to discredit the Democrats, regardless of the truth. The book's examples are mainly about Democrats and totally devoid of any serious analysis of credible evidence. Readers be forewarned ... the book is biased and unfounded."
3,"partisan, gentlemanly, no longer topical","The election is over and most of us have moved on. This book may still be of interest to some. There seems to be a trade-off between making it easy and convenient to vote and insuring the integrity of elections, Republicans come down on one side of the issue and Democrats on the other. Fund is clearly concerned about the integrity issue although he lays out the Democrat position as well.Fund builds a case that steps taken over the last 10 years to make it easy to vote have set the stage for a significant increase in electoral fraud. We're lucky the last election wasn't close. If you're still interested in this issue, this book is a place to start."
1,TERRIBLE! Avoid Wordware books!,"This book so bad that I actually called the publishers to find out if a mistake had been made. CDROM code did not match the book. Code would not compile. Obviously, Wordware did not bother hiring a technical editor for any of these books. They are simply worthless. I believe the reviews for many of his other books sum it up quite well: Spend your money elsewhere! Nathan Wallace has no business churning out computer books, and Wordware Publishing should be ashamed to try to foist these on the public."
4,"Great card, average software","PROS:After a day of playing around this card seems like a really good value. After installing the card I saw a noticeable speed improvement compared to my old Geforce2 MX400. Windows applications loaded and scrolled faster, and games saw a HUGE improvement in framerates and image quality. I haven't used the VIVO feature yet so I can't comment on it. The card is very quiet.CONS:The software bundle is not what it used to be. It no longer comes with bundled games that the MSI website talks about (Ghost Recon, Morrowind, and Duke Nukem) just 2 CDs - an MSI utility disk, and WinDVD Creator. The MSI modified drivers (on the CD, and updated versions on their website) seem buggy. A few EA sports games wouldn't run until I got the drivers direct from the NVIDIA website. Now the games work fine.BOTTOM LINE:5 star hardware, 3 star software"
5,This is the second best book that I have ever read.,"Meter Neter 2 is second only to Meter Neter vol one.It,s spiritual knowledge is second to no other Spiritual information/teaching.I recommend it to any individual looking for true spiritual developement. It's practical application gives you the steps to spiritual developement. Minister Alexander Moore Hetep!!!!"
2,Better than vol 1,"While the author has created a coherent, well written and easy to read book on egyptian spirituality, once again the author bogs the topic down with endless references to black supremacy.I am sorry, but for those of us that dont know much about black history (except that they have been horribly supressed), it becomes a bit tiredsome to read. The spiritual information has value, and it is very interesting, but the endless war against white researchers just kills the experience for me. I have no axe to grind, and i dont care about color. The spirit has no color."
2,"Keep talking, Andy, don't write another book!","I wasn't expecting brilliant journalism from Andy North, but even with low expectations I got a lot less. North confesses that he was urged to do the book by his co-author, young attorney Burton Rocks. Well, let's put it this way: one plays golf and one practices law -- NEITHER can write! This book is filled with stories of minimal interest, but it's the lame and lackluster way they're told that loses the reader. It's obvious there was no EDITOR even remotely connected with this attempt. The writers do try to make their efforts stand out, however, by liberal use of exclamation points! Nearly every story (no matter how mundane) ends with an exciting piece of punctuation! It gets real old, real fast!!"
5,Recommended reading for all golfing enthusiasts,"Two-time United States Open champion and ESPN commentator Andy Roth pre-sents The Long And The Short Of It, a candidly personal memoir in which Andy shares his memories of growing up in general and his fond reminiscences on the great sport of golf in particular. Packed with insights to becoming a better golfer, as well as speculations on challenges facing the sport of golfing in the future, The Long And The Short Of It offers insightful commentary on multiple levels and is very highly recommended reading for all golfing enthusiasts from country club duffers to professional tour aspirants."
3,Definitely Good,"Francine Rivers is a great author. I have read many of her books. The only thing I didn't like about this book is the fact that it is several short stories about women from the Bible. This really isn't a flaw with the book, it's just my personal preference - I'm not a short story person. I like reading novels to get caught up in the story and have a beginning, middle, and a nicely wrapped up conclusion. The book does give you a nice look at some very notable Biblical women."
5,Lineage of Grace,"I have read some of these as individual books before but this was so much better to read them in chronological order with the history to go along with each one. A great Biblical review of the lineage of Christ, written in Francine Rivers' descriptive way that makes each character come to life in a very believable way."
5,Wonderful Books!!!,Francine Rivers is my Favorite author of all time! I have to say it is so hard to find books with so much emotions and River`s knows how to keep an audience learning in a fun matter! Her books make me hungrier for the word of God!
5,One of my favorites - to share with friends,"I love to share the books in this collection with my friends - they are all in one volume - easier to share! This series really helped me to understand these Biblical women. Even though the details are not all from the Bible, the books are very well researched and ""could"" have happened (based on historical information). I like how the Biblical story is included and discussed after the fictionalized version."
5,Wonderful read!,"This book is SO interesting. I love learning about the culture of Bible times, and the author's point of view of 'how it may have happened' seems so real. This book makes Bible characters more real."
5,Another great series by Francine Rivers,"She really brings the stories of the Bible to life. A must read for every Christian, in my opinion! I love all of her books."
3,Inspirational,"Ms Rivers writes great Christian stories. They inspire the reader to want to be a better child of God. I have thoroughly enjoyed most of her books. My only problem with her writing is that being Catholic myself, her depiction of Mary, Our Blessed Mother, is way off the mark."
2,The last story made me angry!,"It was a good book until I got to the last story. Mrs. Rivers should have left the story of Mary alone. It was written with the same old style as the other stories. Her portrayal of the Holy Mother of God made me angry because she was made to look common. The Mother of God is anything but common. Francine should not even have touched the story of Mary! In my anger, I couldn't even finish reading it. If you want to read about Mary, pick up your Bible and read Luke."
5,A Lineage of Grace,"Excellent book!! My favorite story was ""Ruth and Boaz""~this book has 5 stories of Biblical women in it~""Bathsheba""~etc. I have passed it on to my mom and sisters~they have loved it just as much as I have!!!"
5,Absolutely Amazing,"I love Francine Rivers books and have devoured every one I have read. This collection of stories astounded me. I have lived and read the scripture all my life, preached it, taught it, loved it...but these stories touched me and opened my eyes to these women like nothing I have ever read before. I would have to say they are inspiring, encouraging, and for any woman who feels unloved, unimportant, or untouched by God's calling - an absolute must read. I have encouraged women to read these stories. My own daughter has today been diagnosed with a rare and deadly cancer and I am ordering this collection for her because I am so sure they will help her know how much God loves her and how important she is to God's plan and purpose for her family and friends and any others that God will so Will to touch. God bless you, Francine Rivers. I would love to know you personally."
5,A Lineage of Grace: Five Stories of Unlikely Women Who Changed Eternity,The book is about 5 biblical women who contributed to the lineage of Jesus. I found the book very interesting and easy to read context. I have read about these women in the Bible but learned much more about them from reading this book. I would strongly recommend this book.
5,Lineage of Grace shows true hearts of women,Wonderful descriptions of Biblical characters and the culture of that time. Encourage women to read how the strength of these women can be a model for women in today's culture.
4,Lineage of Grace,"I love the way Francine incorporates scripture in with the story and then ends with more scripture and questions.I also like the way she gives her analogy of the feelings of the characters,but yet backs the story up with scripture."
5,Awesome group of books,"""Lineage of Grace"" was fun to read. With 5 stories included in one book, it was easy to find yourself 'right there' with the characters. Each was a story of a woman that was called by God to be in the lineage of the Messiah. All but one of the 5 women came from life situations that one wouldn't think 'acceptable' to be used of God. The story telling made the actual history more meaningful."
4,A Linage of Grace,"Rivers has wonderful insight into the times and life of the Characters. She weaves a great story. Her ideas are in line with the Word of God. I love the way she gives the Bible's account of the story at the end, then supplies thought provoking questions along with that. Would be great to use in small group bible study. If you are not into Bible stories this makes a great read also."
4,Lineage of Grace by Francine Rivers,It's a book of 5 different Bible stories written from the perspective of one person's views with extra details that could easily have happened. Francine Rivers is a great author and knows how to tell a story.
5,worth buying,This is one of those books that you want to re-read several times...worth buying!!! I love the sequence of the stories as well and the authors view on what each one of these women's lives were like. All I can say is that you will be missing out on a very insightful and wonderful book if you decide not to read this one...so read it :)
4,Well written,"The stories, taken directly from Bible stories, are well written and enjoyable. They are written more in the vein of ""teaching"" and definittely have a distinct message. There are additional scripture passages and questions at the end of each ""book-ette"" designed to be thought provoking. I felt that the additional ""study"" materials were fairly simplistic, but I did enjoy the scripture passages which served to provide continuity and background support for the stories."
5,Awesome but requires a lot of water!,"I've hooked a 3/4"" heavy duty hose to these in order to get full coverage, and that works well. A standard 5/8"" hose won't get you anywhere near full coverage. With the 3/4"", I get about 90-100' diameter. Just realize you'll still need to overlap.I also like the flexibility to control both distance and spray pattern. Diffusing the water will reduce the distance though."
4,"Catheter, IV, or Me?","In the mid- to late 1960s, a spate of quick, quasi-naughty books were written about young 'career girls,' in varying jobs such as stewardess or secretary. This particular one concerned Air Force nurses.The book skips over the three year hospital-based training that would have preceded the young nurses' enlistment. That alone would have been interesting reading. In the late 1960s, nurses still tended to be ""trained"" in such diploma programs, rather than ""educated"" at colleges and universities. Hospital-based diploma programs required student nurses to live in dormitories on the hospital grounds and basically used them as cheap labor, running the hospital on evening and night shifts after their school day ended.Very much like Coffee, Tea, or Me?, Tender Loving Care provides a zany, madcap peek at the follies and frolics of young nurses on an air force base. As a representation of the genre, it's above average. As a representation of literature ... well ... never mind. LOL"
4,Great 80's Pop,"I bought this in cassette form when it came out in '86-'87. I played it so much that when I wanted to play it a year ago it would not play anymore. So, I bought the cd and it still sounds great. You can only beat the price if you buy it used!"
4,Superlative Sound,"Who knew it'd be their last hit album? Two smash US singles, production and arrangements by studio wizard Peter Wolf, and even an appearance by Michael MacDonald didn't guarantee post 1987 success, though ""Warmer Side of Cool"" had its merits.That said, it's great to hear these tracks in the CD format. ""Points on the Curve"" didn't make the transition to CD easily, and ""To Live and Die in L.A."" has only a few points of interest. The drums in particular sound fantastic, especially on ""Eyes of the Girl,"" their best sounding track ever. Jack Hues' voice is is fine form, too. The lyrics are hit and miss, but Wang Chung was never in a writer's competition with Squeeze or Elvis Costello, so who cares?Would love to hear more songs like ""Betrayal"" or ""Eyes of the Girl,"" so boys, take note and hope to hear you on the airwaves with new stuff soon!"
2,"Two good songs, two pretty good. That's all.","""Everybody Have Fun"" and ""Let's Go"" are terrific pop songs, catchy and with a beat. I must've heard them (involuntarily) hundreds of times on my health club sound system over the years. They are quite good. ""Hypnotize Me"" and ""Eyes of the Girl"" are pretty good, too. The rest are dull and boring, and the last one, ""World in Which We Live"" is pretty awful.I bought this record on vinyl when it came out, and rarely had the patience to sift through the tracks by lifting and dropping the needle. Now, with all my music on my computer, I can pick and choose, and I've put the above four tracks onto my hard disc. But for those of you looking to shell out money for a good new CD, it probably isn't worth it. The four good songs are probably on some best-of collection, a better choice."
3,Unless you are a hard core WC fan skip this one...,"Unless you are a hard core WC fan skip this one. The best tracks on this cd are also available on their greatest hits cd, ""Everybody Wang Chung Tonight..."". All good stuff on that CD plus a ""dance"" remix of Dance Hall Days and, my favorite - a demo version of Everybody Wang Chung Tonight. It's pretty much a piano/synthesizer/drum machine version of the song that gives you some insight into how a bare song gets dressed up and arranged into a full blown pop tune."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I just wanted to write this review because this product should NOT be sold! I have NEVER written a review on a product before, but this is such poor craftsmanship that I felt I had to write something and help at least 1 person from buying this bookshelf. It seemed like a great idea, but I cannot describe how flimsy and cheap this bookshelf really is. Being handy, I have built this bookcase up, but its still difficult making the functional. I wouldn't pay $5 for this brand new at a garage sale. Don't buy this"
4,Great book storage,"Bought this for my granddaughter's 1st birthday. We're on opposite sides of the Atlantic & I wanted a present that was a reminder of us (soppy?). She loves it, her Dad & Mom had no problems with building it & are happy with the amount of storage."
4,"Nice product, long shipping","Great product, very nice and easy to put together, it s colorfull and fit perfectly for my 2 years old daughter. Shipping took more than 1 month..."
3,Not worth $,"Safari Book DisplayWe received this product on time and it took quite time to put together. Could have provided spare screws, one provided in the pack was total useless. We havnt still fixed it properly because of that.For the money they charge, shoudl have included couple of spare screws. Guides are not professional"
1,Very poor construction and heavily overpriced,"I have assembled quite a few complicated furniture at home and this simple piece is the worst I have ever encountered. The top supporting rod immediately cracked on the first attempt to fix it. One of the screws completely cracked into half!When fully assembled, it looks puny and extremely fragile. Its been a complete waste of moneyProbably, the cost price of this piece is < 5 dollars"
2,Not as good as it looks,I bought the book in March 1998...and sincerly it isn't as good as it looks.......
