5,The deluxe edition of End of Silence is awesome!,I LOVE RED! The deluxe edition of End of Silence is awesome! The DVD is very awesome! RED is my favorite band. Check these guys out!
5,Great Album,"Great band, ground breaking sound. Thank GOD for RED. One of the best bands creating positively charged music today. This is a band definitely worth plugging into."
5,love the music but had PROBLEM with the package,"i love Red, they are my favorite band so i ordered this and when it came in the mail the cd case was cracked!!????? what the heck!? how do i get a new one sent?"
5,Red - End of Silence,This was such an unexpected surprise! The music on this album is fantastic! For a christian metal band the sound was amazing!
1,Picture does not match described product!,"The illustration does not match the product described. The ""box"" is Remington's ""game load"" while the seller states this is Remington's ""heavy dove load. The size of the shot, etc. is quite different.I would be certain which product they are trying to sell before I bought this product at this price!"
3,Good for too many tomatoes,Looking at the recipes there doesn't seem to be anything much new in here.
4,A tomato delicacy... of a book!,"I had a student working on a report (actually it was his mother doing the inquiring, he was contemplating ""other things"") VEGETABLES.The last part of the project that was being worked-on was for a recipe. His topic was carrots. I hate to tell you what transpired during therecipe search, but he did not like carrot cake. The mother insisted that he did not need make it. He did not care whether he had to makeit or not, he sure did not want her to include that recipe!I wound-up ordering the attached list of books. They came into the library a week ago. What a great little series. Do take the time toperuse Amazon. They are a real ""repast!"""
4,Clay Adventure,Great projects with good advice and solid hand building techniques that any teacher and student could master.
5,Rips Up The AR Farce,"The book is full of facts, something foreign to the emotionally fueled, irrational movement that the book exposes. An excellent text for the thinking person."
1,First time author misplaces animal compassion facts,"I recently read a copy of Ward M. Clark's Misplaced Compassion. I am not a PETA member, but do believe in animal rights. I feel that the author has missed the mark completely in his analysis....and his so called ""expertise"" comes only from his interest in hunting. I think that Mr. Clark needs to do more research before writing another book. Also, he needs to stick to facts -- there is too much fiction in his writing. He really deserves no ""stars"" with this one!"
1,Inane diatribe,"As a human being, animal rights advocate, and open-minded individual it seemed only right to review this so-called book. Needless to say, Ward's arguments hold no water--ethical or intellectual. Even my husband who is a hardcore meat-eater would never make the same, sad excuses that Ward makes in this book. I suggest serious intellectual debate be left to more apt-minded individuals."
1,We have made such strides in the past decades yet still have so many more mountains to cross,"Call me a bleeding heart, I don't care. But I would rather exhibit compassion towards my fellow beings by supporting animal rights than go through my entire life trying to make up lame excuses for why it is ok to trample on the ""lower species""."
1,typical,"One could buy this book for help sleeping soundly on a stomach full of flesh, but there are dozens of anti-AR websites that work toward the same end. Before diving into opposing arguments, one should be versed in the philosophy of the movement (a good start is Singer's ""Animal Liberation"")."
4,A great find,These stylus' work just fine. They aren't quite the quality of the original one that came with the Palm Lifedrive but I've had no problem with them and the pen feature is a plus. These were the only ones on the market (that I could find) and the price was low. I am very pleased.
3,Why can't you get the same product as the OEM version? Hate Palm....,"I remember buying these. Mysteriously, they aren't the same as the one that came with the Lifedrive (many of us assumed the opposite before purchase)--these styli are inferior and lack the integrity of the OEM stylus--which fits securely in the Lifedrive. Frustratingly, one can't obtain the OEM version.Why did Palm allow their Chinese fabricator to change these? Answer: Palm hasn't cared about its now discontinued PDAs, their owners, and, the Garnet OS for quite some time now."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with these. They are much lighter than the original stylus and the balance point is off. It just doesn't feel comfortable in my hand. Plus, the screw tip is always coming loose, so I constantly had to tighten it. I gave up and bought a non-OEM stylus that works much better."
5,"Great, spacious bag!",I was very pleased when I received the rolling travel bag. It exceeded my expectations. It is much more roomy than depicted on photo/description. Great for short trips and so easy to manuever. I've already recommended it to family members. And to me it certainly was worth the price.
2,"Good idea, poor execution","When the mobile arm from my bedding set did not fit on the crib, I was so happy to find this. However, after installing, the arm was much shorter than expected. I could not find the specs on the page, and stupidly, I figured something ""universal"" would err on side of longer. The short arm resulted in a mobile that is positioned a bit too close to baby for comfort. In addition, you need to use a ribbon to tie your mobile in place if its one of the popular cross arm mobiles. Not a bad look per se, but again, hoped something universal would not need an arts and crafts approach to work. We are now on the look out for something that is longer and does not need a ribbon. Odds are we will return this one once we find a replacement."
3,Mobile Attachment Clip,I am a Grandma and take care of my grandchildren occassionally. I was looking for a mobile to work on my pack n play and found this product. You still have to buy a mobile and then use an s hook or something similar to attach the mobile to the mobile attachment but it works great! Hooks to the side of the pack n play easily but not very securely so you will have to angle it high enough so the little ones can't pull the mobile down. All and all I am happy with this since there is nothing else like it on the market. I just wish it was a little more secure or taller and more angled.
5,Awesome solution!,"If you have one of the newer style cribs that can also convert into a toddler bed, a typical mobile clamp will not fit your crib. I had already bought a mobile that I loved, but it would not fit on my crib properly. This clip was an ideal solution! I simply switched out the arm part of my mobile with this one and it worked perfectly. Definitely worth the money."
3,"As people have stated, definitely NOT universal...","We purchased a Munire crib and then ordered a mobile online and this arm was sent instead of the original from the packaging and the original would have been so much better. Even at the widest clip opening setting the arm does not even fit over the top rail of the crib. I have looked online for one like the original that has a screw-like setup that allows you to place the arm then sandwich the bars between the arm and the screw cap. This clamping device probably fits a majority of cribs, but if you have one with a wide top rail it won't fit."
1,Did not fit my crib,The attachment that came with my mobile did not fit my crib so I purchased this one thinking that it would work. It still did not fit my crib and I ended up finding one at a local baby store that worked fine.
2,Much shorter than original mobile arm!,"I was excited to find a ""universal"" mobile arm, since my regular arm couldn't be attached easily to the cosleeper we use. I was surprised when I tried it today that it is MUCH shorter than the original mobile arm by a good 5 inches. The mobile would be within reach of the baby using this arm! I've already positioned the crib mattress on the highest setting for our newborn, and lowering it would solve the closeness issue, but I don't think I will do that at this point. Also, when I tried the clip on our cosleeper, it didn't hold tight enough, and leaned in quite a bit."
2,Doesn't fit all cribs,"If your crib has a rounded rail, it won't stay upright. The weight of the mobile will pull it down. Unless your crib has a rectangular rail to mount it on, this arm will not be of much use to you."
3,Doesn't Work with HABA Mobiles,"I ordered this product with the HABA Sunshine mobile because Amazon recommended it. The mobile is much to large and hangs too low if used with this clip. I think it would work with other mobiles, just not this one."
1,Didn't Fit My Convertible Crib,"Unfortunately, this didn't fit our convertible crib. The clamp only opens up 2"", and the slats on the top of our crib are wider than that. Good concept, but it just didn't work for us. I guess we'll have to go mobile-less!"
3,"I enjoyed it, but...","This book is heavily researched, and you have to commend the author for taking on such a private subject to begin with. You can sense his enthusiasm and respect for Costello's music, but, even though every Costello album is covered in detail, I was left wanting more. I enjoyed learning new tidbits of information about the various inspirations for some of Costello's more noteworthy songs, but in the end I didn't feel like the book really addressed both parts of its subtitle: Thomson ably covers the ""music"" of Elvis Costello, but the ""life""--his relationship with his family and friends--was a bit lacking. Also the narrative didn't move along with a real thrust; this is no page-turner, in fact it's kind of stagnant in some chapters (felt like a textbook at times). In the end, as a huge Costello fan seeking insight into his brilliant music, the book was worth the read, but it wasn't a particularly enjoyable one."
5,GREAT BOOK!! BUY IT!!,"Anyone interested in Elvis Costello should enjoy this book. Covers a lot of material that has previously been written about but is so well written and provides so much more new info that it is simply a must for your bookshelf. As an added bonus, it also provides a lot of great new photos. Just a wonderful read all around."
2,Don't Bother,"I have never bothered to write a review.That's how bad this book is.This is NOT a biography. It consists almost entirely of setlists and credits put in prose form.There is almost no insight into either the man or his songs.Obviously, Elvis and his friends and family generally refused to cooperate with the writing of this book. So, I understand the author was hard-pressed to provide any real details. What he does is simply organize various material from OTHER sources (magzine reviews, interviews, etc.) which makes for really not much.I'm not joking. The book consists almost entirely of what songs were played at what shows and who played what on recordings.B-O-R-I-N-G."
4,Be Prepared To Lose An Evening...,"...in a good way, I mean.I found this book to be an engaging, well-researched biography of EC. I was a rabid fan in my youth, not so much during the 80's, found myself coming back in the 90's and now am a mature fan in the aughts and etc. EC wrote a lot of the soundtrack to my youth. Interesting to read about his life now.It doesn't get five stars because, well, it just doesn't. But it's worth the rather bargain prices I see you can get it for here (and I paid a low price myself for it--value for money spent).It's not a technical/dry read and not a gushy fan read. Just right."
3,"Who, The What, The Million Dollar Baby","The Million Dollar Baby was a very good book, but it didn't end like everyone thought it would end. The book kept you reading because it would keep you wondering what was going to happen next in the story.I believe that a lot of people should read this book because it would let you know that every thing is not going to just fall in your hand you have to work very hard to be successful in life. That book would really have you thinking It made me cry when. Oh I forgot you have to read the book to figure out what's going to happen in the book. If you don't like reading you can get the movie and watch it. The movie is a little different from the book, but they both end the same. You will enjoy it."
3,This is how i felt,Well this is how i felt about the movie. In some areas of the book where good but it also had its ups an downs. But it did bring me to alot of emtion on the tone of the book. But if you wanted to buy this i would tell you that you are better off watching the move instead.
5,Million Dollar Baby: Stories from the Corner,This is a classic read. I have many books I read again and again. I learn something new every time. I will reread these stories for years to come.Wish Toole was still alive.
5,Loved The Stories,"Great stuff here! If you are a boxing fan like me, you couldn't ask for any better than this. Toole's language, dialouge, and characters are all on the money. This man knows what he is talking about! As I read through the stories, I could smell the cigar smoke that always hovers over the crowds watching a fight and feel the sweat as it slung off the boxer's bodies. That is how great Toole captured the ambiance of boxing. My hat is off to this 67-year-old who finally got his first book published."
4,Winner In Life,"The book Million Dollar Baby is a good book. In this book it teaches values of life. It wiil show you how to never give up on any of your dreams. The thing that I like most about the book was when people was telling Hillary that she was to old to follow her dreams. It shows that through all odds that no matter what people say that you can alwsys make your dreams come true. The only part that I did not like was how her family act towards her. The book is great I think that it is a good book for people to read. The book was very good and it will keep you on your toes so read this book, and you will not be disapointed."
4,Leading with the Right,"Like a right lead, this book is effective and surprising, but it is left vulnerable. Toole does an excellent job of decribing the gritty, intense, and certainly brutal boxing life in each of the six short stories contained in this volume, but he doesn't really examine anything new. The stories tend to have fairly bland characters and involve recycled plots, but this is tolerable because the writing is excellent. While I was never on the edge of my seat because the stories were relatively predictable, I did not want to put the book down and was eager to start the next story as soon as I finished one. This isn't what I would call great literature, but I would recommend it to boxing fans or anyone who was a Rocky fan, Rope Burns is right up your alley."
4,KO!!!!,"This book is probably the best book i ever read. The story is based on Maggie (Hill Billy) who want to become a fighter and Clint (the boss)who Maggie want to be her trainer and also have some problem with his daughter. Maggie wanted to become a fighter and she need a trainer become one. so there it is Maggie selected clint to be the one. Clint don't want to be a trainer because of the problem that he had with his daughter in the past. Maggie never leave him alone, so he decided to coach maggie and that when the book started hit you with some happy and sadness of what happen to Maggie. This book brings you emotion and violences by Maggie and Clint. This book is also about Maggie family of being not support her with what she wanted to becaome. that why this book is good to read."
3,rocky all over,"this is a descent but meaningless book. this book reminds me off rocky but in the remix off several other people. the book is'nt even a full story the name is million dollar baby, but that is only one story in the book, thats wright it's a book ful off short stories and i think that your getting tricked if you watch the movie first or just go off of the title of this book. this is one off those books that gets you with a good movie and a decent title."
2,Mediocre,"The reviewer who wrote the ""NOT A CONTENDER"" review hits this book on the head. I too listened to Ellroy's recommendation and like that reviewer found the book to be lacking...it's not that the book is awful mind you..it is just that it is full of cliche characters adn repetitive themes."
2,Million Dollar Bummer,"The Million Dollar Baby was a bummer. I mean if like long dry stories that may put you to sleep then read this book. The only story that is filled with action and will keep you on the edge of your seats is the short story Million Dollar Baby. The only reason why that is good because it's just like the movie and the movie is great.The Monkey Look, Black Jew , Rope Burns etc. are about 25-30 pages a peace and they don't keep you into the book as others.The Movie is the only Millin Dollar Baby anything i would waste my time on."
1,Boring,I wouldn't recommend this book at all for one your better off going to see the movie because the book tells a whole bunch of different stories which leads you in different storis instead of just talking about the same thing the whole movie. I would just recommed seeing the movie over the book.
4,"Not a knockout, but worth a read","I can't say I find Toole's writing to be flawless; he strikes me as someone who had a hard time presenting more than one fascinating character per story. But there are certainly some vivid, wonderful moments here, and the detail - about boxing and about life on the fringes of society - is certainly memorable.The two stories that make up the movie ""Million Dollar Baby"" are both here, and if you like that movie, they are both worth a read. Clint Eastwood made some interesting adjustments to them, but much of what Toole wrote is in the movie."
5,Total Command of the Style and Flavor,"In addition to strong plots and tension-filled scenes, Toole's style captures exactly the tone of the environment. he slips in and out of dialects and racial emotions like he's changing hats. The movie was great, but the book contains many other stories. A must read for any boxing fan."
1,ObviousmanStrikes,"Can this loser be more obvious? ""Don't make assumptions about people you don't know. Slow Down and observe them first""? Save your money and go to a park to peoplewatch for a day. Try the kids playing in the sand. You'll learn more about making friends and influencing people in a good way. Unless your one of those growing many in the world of business who are cretins like this guy."
5,Packed With Knowledge!,"and examples about the skills necessary to realize their ambitions in various business cultures. Author David F. D?Alessandro is a marketing guru, and a skilled phrase maker and spin doctor. To his own surprise, he was offered a chair at the management table where the bottom line decisions get made on his way to becoming CEO of John Hancock Financial Services. In the framework of rules for personal branding and in the interest helping you play office politics successfully, D?Alessandro spins dozens of yarns that bring context and reality to a subject that is often speculated about by authors who have never really achieved the success their books describe. His advice is ruthlessly honest, pointed, witty, precise and ripe with polished anecdotes. For this reason we recommend this book to business persons anywhere on the corporate ladder who suspect their battle plan may be ready for a few new moves."
3,Too general - nothing special,"The book gives very general and common advice. Advice like dress well etc is not what people expect from such a book. May be the author was trying to write the book for a very wide and general audience. Decent book for someone in the initial phases of career. For experienced readers, ""The 5 patterns of extraordinary careers"" is a much better book."
3,Not Nearly as Durable as Other Kong Products,"I bought this because I was pleased with the fantastic construction of other Kong products. My 40lbs mutt destoyed this in a week. If you want to play frisbee, get a frisbee. If your dog like to chew, get a chew toy. This hybrid is a nice idea, but not for chewers."
2,Kong branding is a mistake,This thing took my Doberman about 2 minutes to render worthless. Definitely not worthy of the Kong name stamped on it.
4,Great toy,Our dog loves it and it's his new favorite toy. However should not to be left alone for aggressive chewers.
2,Doesnt fly well.,Good quality but doesn't fly very well. My dog was never able to catch it while it was in the air. Plus it doesn't float. Mine sank in the ocean never to be seen again.
3,Not a CHEW toy,Pay attention to the label this is not a chew toy. Only use for tossing and tugging. Once your dog lays down to chew take it away from your dog. It does not fly far about 8-10 feet. After less than 10 minutes of chewing my dog had bitten a hole on the edge of the toy. It still flys and is a fun toy to play with.
2,Doesn't fly,"Yes, it lasts pretty long.. but so does a rope, or a piece of concrete. I expect the other two would fly just as well as this paper weight of a disc."
4,"Not indestructable, but fun","My 80 pound bulldog will rip a small hole in the center within a few hours. Then she has fun tearing out the soft middle so only the ridged outer ring is left. It's pretty cool because they rip out in concentric circles so no little pieces to account for. Once the center is out, the real fun begins because it is much more fun to play tug-o-war. It usually lasts in this configuration for 2-3 weeks (of extreme abuse) before she starts biting off little rubber pieces of the outer ring and it's trash.So, she loves them and they last about a month. Not too bad."
5,A frisbee-like toy that actually lasts!,"Our Boxer loves this toy. We generally get at least a year out of one, before she finally gets her teeth through it playing ""tug"" with us. She is pretty acrobatic, and will leap all 4 feet in the air chasing this, then bring it back and want to play tug with it. We probably use almost every day in warm weather, and on warm days in the winter. It just sits outside all the time. I cant imagine a dog destroying this quickly! Ours is the opposite, if we get a hard plastic disk, she will destroy it in 5 minutes."
1,Not for all dogs,I had read all of the reviews which was the main reason I purchased the product. My dog had completely destroyed the flyer within 1 day. Maybe I got a bad one maybe my dog is unusual I have no idea. Within the first few minutes of using the toy my dog had torn out the center of the disk. By the end of the day it was torn in half. Kong makes great products overall but this may not be for all dogs. I have a 1 year old German Shepherd.
3,chewed,"The toy was to easiy for the dog to chew up it lasted a day, but the dog did enjoy playing with it."
3,"Mehh.. Not bad, but Not Great.","Flies like a missile. Material in the middle is very thin, seems like it could wear and tear easily over time. My Dog enjoys chasing it becuase you can chuck it so far due to the weight. Could take a lot of chewing on the rim, but for me its not meant to be a chew toy... its suppose to be a frisbee. Other Kong products have been outstanding... this frisbee is a little sub par."
3,easily destroyed,"If you have a dog that likes to chew through toys, this is NOT as tough as you think. My corgi was able to rip it up within minutes. I'm sure it would have made a great toy to play fetch with otherwise."
1,Didn't hold up to 3 English Bulldogs playing tug,"With the name brand Kong, I assumed this would be close to indistructable. I was wrong. I have three English Bulldogs here that LOVE to play tug with each other. This toy lasted about half a day. It split all around the inside just after the ""rib"" marks on the outside.I have to say if you have just one that likes to play, it probably will hold up. Mine individually chewed on it and played run around, etc, but within 10 mins of all three playing tug, it was a goner."
3,So much for Kong,"This came quickly, if a little pricey on the shipping. And the first weekend my dog (an Anatolian Shepherd mutt-mix) and his BFF, a 15 month old Great Dane, ripped it to shreds. Actually, they ripped the center out of it, leaving a Kong ring and a Kong flat circle. So much for Kong being ""indestructable."" I don't expect Kong to be literally that, but I did expect it to last longer than one play date."
1,dog ate it in less than 3 minutes,"I rated the Kong Flyer with one star because even though my dog ripped it up, in less than 3 minutes, it still flew pretty well."
1,I expected better from KONG,"My dog is a spaniel. Not overly aggressive. Not your typical chewer. She destroyed this thing after the THIRD throw. The inner ring seperated from the ""indestructable"" red rubbery material.I have loved KONG products in the past. I wouldn't recommend this particular item."
2,Flies like a Brick.,It should be called Kong Dog Toy. One thing good it does is roll pretty good. Too heavy and has a very bad flying edge.
3,Good flyer; Not a chew toy,"So far the only toys my Cattle dog won't destroy immediately are any Kong toys, so I got this to be able to have something to play fetch with outside. It does great in the snow, better than a tennis ball, and is light enough to use inside in open spaces. However, I threw it inside a few times for my dog, and turned my back for about 30 seconds, when I looked back he had almost the entire outside edge ripped off and into pieces! He is a pretty extreme chewer, but that was fast! So, now it is an extremely supervised toy only since he loved playing with it, but I think the entire thing could be in pieces within minutes if I let him."
1,Not Indestructible!,we bought this kong flyer for our 2 year old golden retriever. While left a lone for about 10 minutes she chewed through the edge of the flyer and had pieces everywhere. I thought kong was indestructible but it didn't last too long with our dog.
2,Not Doberman proof,"We had this for about ten minutes before he bit through it. Not Kong quality, the black kong toys are awesome though. I'll not be buying this one again."
5,Tough yet lightweight; flies true and straight,"This is a nice dog ""frisbee"". Easy to throw; flies straight and true. My dogs love catching it. I bought two on Dec 30, 2009 for $5.38 each from Amazon. They did not ship until Jan 11, 2010 but that was OK for me. We've given this flyer a workout and we are still on flyer #1. Have not even opened flyer #2. My two dogs play tug with it a bit as they run back to deliver it to the ""thrower"". No rips, no tears so far; tough but light. I have two 4-1/2 year old ""lab-ri-dingers"" (1/2 choc lab, 1/2 springer spaniel). They are tough on dog ""frisbees"" and tennis balls."
5,Donkey loves it!,"We have a dog named Donkey. We adopted him at 6 months and and he came with the name. He is a dauxhound/fox terrier mix and tips the scale at 14 pounds. He loves to retrieve and will frequently wear himself out with the give and take. He went through about a dozen ""Seatow"" frizbees in as many weeks, often with bloody gums as the plastic broke under his attack. He has had the Kong flyier for a few weeks now and loves it. Needless to say, I like the flexability it has and the softness to his mouth. No more blood! Many of my dog loving friends at the dog park have asked for info."
3,Not as durable as other Kong products,"I had gotten this for our Lab and while admittedly he is pretty rough on toys, he managed to tear the side within 5 minutes of playing with it. It's still fully functional and we'll continue to use it however I would recommend supervised play."
2,like =D,"very good product to other dogs, a very soft material, I destroy my Bull Terrier in 2 days, but loves"
1,Not Kong Worthy,"This ""kong"" frisbee lasted 6 seconds. Yes... 6 seconds! I threw it once and my staffordshire terrier fetched it and ripped it in 2 in 6 seconds. I just got it out of his mouth as he ripped it. One toss, one bite, then garbage. If your dog has a strong bite and Kong toys are the only thing durable enough, then don't buy this."
1,$1.00/ minute = Destroyed in 15 minutes.,"my yellow lab destroyed this in 15 minutes. The rubber ripped off the outer plastic ring (like an under-wire on a bra) and shredded easily.If your dog tugs at all, don't buy this. If he/she drops it nicely EVERY time, it does fly okay. But even one tug will rip this thing apart."
3,Fair Warning,"I have a 7 month old Lab-mix puppy and with the first catch she proceeded to chew a large chunk out of this toy. Be ready to retrieve as soon as they start chewing.She loves playing with her frisbee and gets it out for herself but, it is as vulnerable to a chewer as a lighter child's frisbee (actually the child's frisbee lasted longer).She has had this frisbee for less than a week and it is already missing 4 inches of rim and she ate those 4 inches. Buy it but, beware."
2,Kong Rubber Flyer Fails Dog Park Test,"I bought this toy with the full knowledge that it would be placed in our local dog park after my mutt got through with it. I received it two days ago, gave it to my 10-month old, 40lb Australian Shepherd; who made the edges look like torn rags within two days. Today I took her to the park and let the Kong Rubber Flyer spin through the air. The pack took off after it and within fifteen minutes was torn asunder by three or four dogs having a grand tug of war. Whir le this toy provided us humans with quite a bit of entertainment, I must say, while it lasted, the dogs just tore into it with gusto. Its a great toy and I highly recommend it for your dog's enjoyment. Even if it won't last more than a few days.....:)"
5,GREAT dog toy,"We have an Australian Cattle Dog who absolutely loves this toy. She's great, but she can be pretty rough on her toys. We originally bought her the Flying Squirrel Frisbee (Chuckit! Flying Squirrel Medium 10-inch (Colors Vary)), but she has managed to destroy that one. Then we found the Kong frisbee. It's very durable and the rubber is softer than a regular plastic frisbee, so it doesn't hurt her teeth when she catches it. It's a bit flexible too, so she can bend it and flip it over to pick it up. Just watch your shins and toes if your dog likes to shake their toys to death while playing with you. It hurts a bit if it hits you."
4,so i have a really big dog,bought this for my step dads german shepardhe has a tendency to destroy toys rather quicklydue to his huge teeth and being the size of a grown manso i thought id get him a Kong toysince those are the only ones that usually make it past a few days or weeks.however as soon as i opened the package to this toyi knew it would probably be gone the day he gets itthe outer ring on the disc is as thick as i expectedbut the inner part is about 2/3-1/2 the thicknessi can already see his teeth tearing into it.dont suggest you purchase for any dog over 70 lbsklaus is about 80 but i think even a smaller dog may have the same problemi surprised at the lack of qualityexpected better work from Kong.
3,Durable but heavy,"This dog disc is durable but heavy. It drops like a lead balloon on calm days so I only use it when it's pretty windy, and then it works OK. My dog likes to chew on it more than catch it."
2,My doberman chew a hole in it in 2 days.,"It's not very strong, my 100 pounds dobe chew a hole in the middle in 2 days, I don't want him to swallow the plastic, so I have to throw them away again."
1,Fly's almost as well as a brick,"Sure this frisbee may be durable- but it does not fly any better than a football. If you want a good dog frisbee, try sqidgee or dogobie by ""Aerobie"". I have found these to be both durable, flexible, and they fly very well."
3,Soft disc but a bit heavy,"I bought this disc to play with my dog. It is made of a fairly flexible rubber and is extremely easy on my dog's mouth. However it is also quite heavy and doesn't have very good aerodynamic performance. When I throw it, it sinks to the ground pretty fast. If you just want to toss about in the back yard it is okay, but if you really want to play with your dog I would have to recommend the Hyperflite Jaws Disc over this one."
4,Good for catch...,Only problem is my dog can't catch. I don't know how we'll this will hold up though when she learns how to catch it.
2,Doesn't hold up well.,"This isn't a terrible frisbee--it flies well (even damaged), and it seems pretty tough at first. But if you have a dog that chews on the frisbee between throws, it won't hold up. This lasted my dog about a week of playing once a day (I put the frisbee away when not playing so she can't chew it up). That's better than the last one I got (Dogobie) which lasted 2-3 days before it was trashed. I really wanted to like this one, oh well."
2,"durable, until they chew through it.","It's a bit heavy to fly like a frisbee, but my lab enjoyed it, until he chewed through this like it was bread. Not a toy for chewers."
1,I hate to say it but...,"This toy was destroyed in less than 30 minutes. Anyone with a truly aggressive chewer should be wary. This toy being a Kong, I expected it to hold up to some abuse, and unfortunately this was not the case. I supervised my dog while she was playing with it, and didn't allow her to chew anywhere near as much as she really wanted to; however, even with the minimal chewing she managed to get in while retrieving and returning with the disc was enough to ruin it. I gave up and let her have at it when I saw the damage she was doing, and 24 hours later, all that remains is a saucer-sized piece of the original toy. I don't typically leave negative reviews of products, but I'm hoping to save some people the considerable expense of the toy (when compared to similar types of toys)."
3,Don't expect it to fly like a frisbee...,This is a sturdy flyer.....immune to dog's chewing. Doesn't fly like a frisbee....so don't expect it to! ALSO....it does not float in water! This surprised me because I had wanted to use it for water play with my dog! Oh well...... = )
2,Too heavy to fly like a regular frisbee,"The frisbee itself seems very durable, but it is too heavy to float in the air. If you throw it very hard, it will fly ok. The problem for me is that my dog likes to run from where I am standing and chase the frisbee as it is flying. I have to throw it so hard to get it to fly that it is going about twice as fast as he can run. Maybe on a windy day it would be better.PROS: Durable, softer on the dogs teeth than a regular frisbee.CONS: Heavy. Although soft, it will hit the dogs mouth with more force than a plastic frisbee because of its weight and density. Doesn't float in the air unless you throw it very hard. Yes, it does fly straight as the box states, but so does a rock.I have reverted back to using plastic frisbees for playing catch with my dog, and I let him run around and chew on this frisbee as just a chew toy. For what it is meant to be, it doesn't work well, but as a dog toy my dog still does love it."
2,Not Durable,My dogs had this thing ripped to shreds within minutes. So it may be great for playing catch but don't let your dogs use it as a toy if you are worried about longevity.
2,Dog chewed this up immediately!,"Not sturdy enough to withstand my petite golden! She tore a piece out of it within the first 10 minutes. The next time I gave it to her, she tore off the outer ring. I would say it's not a very sturdy toy. The red kong ball is great, though!"
2,Did not hold up to the usual Kong toys,We have had other Kong toys and have done very well with them. This frizbee did not hold up and was chewed up rather quickly.
1,Lasted only a few minutes,"My puppy destroyed this within a few minutes of being left alone with it. Granted, I shouldn't have left him alone with the frisbee but I also couldn't believe it was destroyed that fast...."
5,Best Frisbee EVER,"My dog loves frisbees but she always destroys them after about a day. I decided to look for a frisbee that could hold up to my two large dogs. This one did for about 7 months. It finally gave in when she ripped out the center and it became a ring instead of a frisbee. I am going to order another because even though my dogs sucessfully tore the center out, it still lasted the longest.If I didn't buy this product, I would have spent twice the amount of money buying plastic frisbees. This frisbee also flies very well. I had to throw it carefully so I wouldn't go over the fence. This is the best frisbee for dogs who love to play tug-of-war. I really love this product."
2,Not durable for a German Shepherd,"I am such a huge fan of the Kong products and my 2 year old German Shepherd has yet to destroy his Kong bone or ball but the ""Flyer"" couldn't withstand itself for more than a day. My dog ripped it up in minutes of getting it. I guess it's more durable than a regular plastic Frisbee but don't automatically compare it to other Kong products."
1,Useless for frisbee play,"I purchased this Kong frisbee for my border collie, as her regular frisbees were getting chewed up rapidly. It does hold up well as a chew toy for her, but as a flyer, it fails. It is heavy and floppy, and just flies poorly. My girl loves to run and catch, and this just didn't work for her for frisbee play. She loves it around the house as a chew toy, however, so that helps this not be a total loss. :)"
2,Hmm...this was overrated,"This sounded sooo good in the reviews. I bought the larger one for my 40 lb. labradoodle who's quite active. The frisbee is hard to throw well as it's so flexible. THat wasn't so bad, but it won't fly very far. What got me upset was how my dog was able to bite on it so easily. He chewed little pieces off and began running off with it instead of bringing it back to me, so he had even more time to chew it up. Needless to say, I don't let him play with this anymore unless I'm sure he's in a retrieving mood!"
2,ate to pieces,i have always heard that Kong toys are the best quality for dogs so I got this product and was disappointed. I took one day and it was in shreds from my dog. i understand she is only 2 1/2 but i should have just bought more rawhides.
2,Used to be stronger,"I remember this piece to be stronger... My dogs tore it within 3 minutes. I think they changed the design to be more soft (it says so in the cover), but it is not as strong as it used to be. I am a bit disappointed.If you are buying for one dog, this is great but I would recommend the Booda 10-Inch Soft Bite Floppy Disc - it flys better. If this is for two and they will fight over it - forget it. Although I am yet to find something stronger."
1,not recommended for large dogs,My dog chewed this item up within the first houw of playing with it. I was hoping it would last longer.
2,NOT THE ADVERTISED PRODUCT,"I ordered two of these on August 1 since I already have the 9.5"" Kong Flyer and my dog loves it. When the package arrived, there were two 6.5"" PUPPY Kong flyers. THIS IS NOT THE 9.5"" ADULT DOG FRISBEE - THIS IS THE VERSION INTENDED FOR PUPPIES. I'm sure that this is a great toy, it's just not what they advertised it to be."
2,Wish it was more durable!,"My dog LOVES this toy, but it is not as durable as I had hoped. He's had it a couple days now but has already torn several small rips into it. I do not let him have it unless we are specifically playing catch, because I know he would destroy it even more quickly. I wish it was more durable like the black Kong products. I got it when it was on sale for about $6. I would never pay the full $24 price for it. When he finally destroys it, I am not going to buy it again."
2,not for the aggressive chewer,"This did not last more than an hour with my pitbull. I have bought several frisbees and so far none have held up for very long. The kong flyer might hold up for a dog who isn't such an aggressive chewer, but not for my pitbull."
2,wont last,"bought it, flies great but my dog had chewed it up in a matter of minutes after catching it over and over. The .99 frisbee at pet smart lasted months, this didn't last a day"
5,This thing is good!,"Our pup has always managed to chew other ""Flyers"" to bits within a few days....not this one! It flies nicely....perhaps it is not suitable for ""official"" competitions, for whatever reason, but it's great in the backyard."
1,Used to be the best,"I don't know what has happened to the once-spectacular Kong Frisbee. They used to last for six months. Then three months. Then two months. My latest purchase has now gotten a rip in it, after only TWO WEEKS of use. What happened Kong? Cheaper rubber? Quality control department laid off? Manufactured in China? These were always the BEST frisbees!! Now they are junk. Why? Why? Why? I hate to switch to the non-rubber frisbees as they don't fly as far or as straight as the Kong. A sad owner and a sad pup..."
3,Not very rugged,My dog was able to chew this apart even though it was kong. I was hoping it would be more durable
1,BUMMER!,"Ok I love Kong products, two large Labs here...need the tough stuff...big tug-o-war pooches at my house! This was chewed up in MINUTES. Wish I could say otherwise. it feels tough, to the touch. When I got it, I was happy and thought it would be great. By the time I had unpacked it...handed it over and put the packaging in trash the destruction began.:("
5,very durable,"This is the best frisbee I have found to date, it is very durable and flies well, I like it much better than a hard plastic frisbee- which can get rough on your hands after repeated use and sometimes crack if chewed on. I will buy this again and again if it ever gets worn out which I doubt will happen any time soon."
2,Not for aggressive chewers.,"I bought this thinking it would stand up to my 10 month old doberman (like many other kong products do), but she destroyed it almost immediately. I realize that there are certain weight/density restrictions with a ""rubber flyer,"" but I just wanted to warn others with dogs prone to shredding not to waste their money."
1,Kong Flyer Frisbee was broken after 3 minutes,I would not recommend the Kong Frisbee flyer. At lease not for larger dogs. It was torn right away and unusable.It is not strong like you would think for a Kong item. Maybe it would work for a small dog or large dog that is very carefull.
2,Not Impressed,"My lab and retreiver are very strong chewers, so please take that into consideration. I found this product to be somewhat heavy for a flying disk. I didn't think it went very far when I tossed it and my dogs chewed on it right away. The edges are now very jagged. I still use it, but have to pull it away from the dogs and when we're done playing I have to put it away. They would destroy it if I left it in the yard."
3,good product,"My dog lost his favorite frisbee--I don't know the brand, but it had an opening in the middle which made it easier for him to pick up off the ground. Anyway, of course as soon as we received the Kong, we found the other frisbee. Kong is OK so far. He's not managed to tear it up, and he chews up everything. It's a little heavy when flying."
5,Great dog frisbee,"This is by far the best dog Frisbee I have ever used. It is really the only one that is capable of standing up to the daily use of my American Bulldog. This is the second one we have purchased, the first one lasted over a year. It probably would have lasted longer if we hadn't left it outside constantly. The only other frisbee we have used that has even come close to the durability of this is the Flying squirrel by Chuckit, but the Kong has it beat."
3,"Great, but didn't last long","Our dog (a 1-yr. old 20kg Staffordshire Terrior mix) has a habit of chewing and destroying toys, and this was no different. The frisbee was great to play with on the beach (warning--does not float) and in parks, but it wasn't long before our pup put his ""death shake"" to good use. Basically, the inner circle of the frisbee was eventually shaken/chewed out, leaving only the rim. He still enjoys chewing on the rim and wearing it as a necklace, but it has lost its flying capabilities. We recently purchased the extreme kong black frisbee and it has survived so far (1 week). The red rubber flyer is great--many of my friends have one for their dogs--but it IS destructible if your dog is like mine."
2,Flies great but.....,Not great for chewers. I've gone through like 5 of these things since my pitbull pup was 8 months old which he is now 10 months and the latest frisbee only lasted about 3 play sessions and there is a gaping hole on the middle that he made I'm switching to west paw to see how long they last. I recommend this for smaller dogs even tho it says ideal for 85 lb dogs.
2,Dont care for it,"My dog didn't ruin it, but we had a heck of a time trying to throw it. Its pretty heavy for a frisbee (since its rubber) and we found it went a little too fast instead of the slow motion of a normal frisbee. Our dogs couldn't ever catch it."
4,Seems very durable,"I find the $2 cheapo Frisbees are generally fine for the dog, but I'm sure the chewed sharp edges aren't doing her or me any favors. So I tried the Dogobie Disk, and that was lots of fun, light, flys pretty straight, and far. This Kong is a lot different. VERY heavy in comparison. Throws very straight, as far as you can throw it. I think we will have the two I bought for years, unless they get lost.So this thing seems WAY more durable than the Dogobie. So if your dog destroys flying things, then this is a great toy.Our Dogobie is about a year old, and is missing a quarter sized edge from Lucy gnawing on it. But... It's lighter, easier for me to throw and I would assume Lucy likes carrying it back better.Honestly, if I buy more flying disks (other than the cheapo Frisbees), I'll probably get the another Dogobie."
2,Kong Rubber Flyer,I have two dogs one is a ACD mix she had this 'flyer' for less than five minutes and was already breaking off chunks of it. I buy Kong because they are durable and I thought that this would withstand her chewing but apparently not. I have kept it away from them and just use it as a frisbee.
2,lasted one week,The frisbee throws good but is not true kong standards in my eyes. I ended up finding a different brand and shows a little tear but no plastic off it its light blue clear soft rubber and its a little more expensive probably because of the better quality material and they made it thicker.
3,Sturdy but too heavy to fly well,I've bought all kinds of flying discs for my dogs. This one is very sturdy and stands up to a lot of abuse by my Airedales. It doesn't fly very well. It's too heavy to make it float in the air.
2,Hardly Kong quality,"Usually I have had great experienced with Kong products in the past. Reading that this frisbee was very durable (although not a chew toy), I bought this with confidence that my 50lb dog would not be able to destroy this easily. To get to the point, within 5 minutes of my dog playing with this frisbee, it was shredded into a million pieces. You are better off buying a 99cents frisbee from PetSmart."
3,Okay,"This product is good in that it is durable and won't be torn apart too easily; however, it is also fairly heavy and doesn't fly well unless you have space to really heave it. We have a small yard and when we try to throw it, it goes to the ground too fast for our dog to care to chase and catch it."
2,"Poor flyer, get a JAWZ instead","I got one of these for my sister's dog. He hasn't destroyed it, but it simply does not fly nearly as well as the JAWZ disc I got for my two dogs. The Kong disc is basically a tank of a disc. My dogs will occasionally play tug of war with the JAWZ on the retrieval and it stands up to the abuse AND is a better flyer than the Kong."
5,Absolutely the BEST dog frisbee on the market.,"This frisbee is durable, nicely-weighted, and easy on the dog's mouth/face. It can easily be thrown 40+ yards by a good thrower, and holds up well in 10 mph winds. Anyone saying it isn't durable is not reading the packaging--you're not to let your dog chew on it at all. Any properly trained dog knows it's the master's frisbee anyway! With proper use, these last me 1-2 years with 2-4 20 minute sessions each week!"
5,Perfect for the destructable dog!,The first Kong held up for almost six months before it started to tear. I was a little disappointed at first but totally understandable since our dog would trash most toys in seconds flat. The good news was she tore apart the entire middle section so we now had just the outside ring (which still flew like a regular frisbee). Fabulous product!!! Bought another one.
1,chewed up in 5 minutes,2 things wrong with the flyer1. its so heavy it flies like a discus which makes it fall to fast for the dog to get under it and jump/catch which is the whole point. also hard and tiring to throw2. even though its so heavy my golden (who is not a big chewer) had one edge ripped up from trying to pick it up off the grass...we have much better luck which plain old frisbees and they last a month or so
2,Mediocre....,"I was looking for a toy that my three pittbulls wouldnt destroy completely in under ten minutes when I found this toy...As far as the flying par goes, if two dogs tug on it, it isnt likely to fly very well....If your dog slobbers on his toys, then youre really not going to dig the way that this toy gets coated with slime and that gets allll over your hands...Its gross....But on the other hand, there hasnt been a singel hole put in this toy by any of my dogs yet, so maybe there is some good in this after all....not bad price either, with shipping added, about the same as if you go to a pet store...."
5,Love love love this toy!,"I finally found a toy that my pit rescue loves and won't destroy just by clamping down on it! She is so focused when chasing this - she loves to catch it and bring it back. The rubber is soft so it won't damage her teeth, but pretty strong that she can't easily puncture it. It is pretty floppy so she also enjoys shaking it around and folding it over like a taco and carrying it that way. This frisbee flies relatively well. It is a bit heavier (due to the kong rubber) than most frisbees, but overall it does pretty well with distance.I do have to say that I made the mistake of leaving my dog out in the backyard alone with it and she did tear through it within a minute or two of solid, focused chewing - but she really had to work at it. So overall I think this is a great product - will be ordering a replacement and will keep it out of her reach when we are not actively playing."
2,Flys Terrible,this frisbee is flimsier than I thought it would be. Plastic can float alot better. Needs to be thicker to handle right.
1,not a real flyer,I was expecting this frisbee to he of hard rubber like the kong toys but it is not. This is soft rubber and doesn't fly good at all. Perhaps I not the best frisbee thrower but it is by far the worst one i have tried. Very dissappointed as I am a fan of kong.
3,frisbee for a day,"My dog really did like this, although I learned to not let her have it to play with. It's a great flyer and tough construction, but just like anything else, it can be ripped apart. She ate about 1/3 of it before I realized it. Next time, we'll just play frisbee then I'll take it from her until the next time."
3,love it,"our wire haired pointer loves it, he has not been able to destroy it either, which is saying something. he can chew through most things easily**UPDATE** 2/20/2013Our wire hair pointer has destroyed this Frisbee. Maybe if you only take it out for play, then immediately put it away, it might least longer. Too bad."
5,Pitbull proof,"Well made, heavy and flies well. It's still looking good after a week. Sherman our pitbull has destroyed every other frisbee we have tried within minutes."
3,Great but rips easily,"This flyer is good, but it rips easily. I ordered 4 of them last time bcs I knew they were going to be destroyed in a few days. My pup always pokes a hole in the middle. Its a great toy for winter tho. Roxy always loses her ball in the snow and we have no problems with the flyer."
2,A heavy piece of rubber shaped like a frisbee,"If you're looking for something that flies / glides like a real frisbee so your dog can chase it down and at the last second and make a miraculous leap into the air to intercept it, then don't get this frisbee. It doesn't really fly, it falls with style. The hang time is not even half of a regular plastic frisbee, and my dog knows the difference. She doesn't even have the same interest in this. I think i'll try to return it since I buy tons of stuff from Amazon. (I don't feel so bad returning a 9 dollar toy)"
1,All Chewed Up,"My dog isn't a heavy chewer & the 1st one we bought a few mos ago held up fine. That's why I bought a back-up, but half the rim was chewed off in a couple of days. Can't tell if the quality is inferior to the 1st one, or if he just likes this one better!Still, he prefers these over any of the others."
2,Not for strong dogs or chewers,"Based on the Kong name brand, I thought this frisbee would be great for my two Rottweilers. I was terribly wrong - this didn't last more than 5 minutes. The dogs got a hold of the frisbee and the entire outside ring of the toy was removed from the inside circle in less than 5 minutes. This is not a durable frisbee - not made for strong dogs or aggressive chewers."
3,"Poor flyer, dog loves it","My aussie was able to rip the middle part of this frisbee out after a few days of play. However, the outer band has held up for a year. It's now more of a flying ring, but the dog still loves it."
3,High flyer...but watch out for those teeth!,"My Belgian Malinois has enjoyed about 2 weeks of bliss with this product, but it's already time for a new one. Her incisors have managed to put serious holes through the middle of the frisbee and it's starting to wobble when thrown. If it was just a littttle more sturdy like the other Kong products, I think this would be a frisbee for the ages for those of us with dogs who have power jaws. I might consider checking out the other frisbees that claim to be sturdier and see if they hold up any better. As for comfort, the Kong Flyer was the best for our pooch who would carry it around the yard no matter what was going on."
2,Not Durable,"Bought one for my 11 month old Dobie, who tends to make short work of most toys. This Kong frisbee was no exception. She had a chunk ripped out of the rim in about an hour. Maybe an ok toy for a dog that's more passive."
2,To heavy,"My dog loves to play with Frisbee but chews on it so I got this one thinking best of both worlds,""NOT"" It doesn't float in the air like a Frisbee it is to heavy so just drops. She won't play with it rather have her plastic Frisbee."
5,ZOE the cwazy Pit luvs it,"My LIL PIT Zoe luvs to run and catch or chase things, plays fetch ALL DAY. She luvs to run after this flyer whci doesn't hurt her gums or teeth. When she tugs it doesn't rip or break which makes me happy too. Price was great ."
4,Thinner than expected but still tough,"My lab tears apart every every toy we give him within a few days and this has held up much longer. It's pretty floppy and thin, but flys well and handles tug-of-war with ease."
1,Listen to the reviews!,"Yeah it was a piece of junk, I let my cheapness get the better of me. It fell apart almost instantly."
2,Mediocre Clothes Hanger Bar,"Bought this for a trip from Virginia to Florida. Within 20 miles of the start, the bar fell out of the hanger on the driver's side. The hangers (the part in the picture for this product that hangs on the ""panic handle"") are not permanently attached to the bar - there is a sleeve about 1-1.5"" ling into which the bar fits.at my first stop, I reinserted the bar and repositioned the clothes. As I drove, I noted in the mirror that the bar (plastic) tends to bow with the weight of the clothes - and I was using only lightweight summer clothes on this trip.This clothes hanger might work better if the hangers were permanently attached to the bar. I intend to either ""super glue"" them or put a short screw to act as a set screw."
3,Does not fit smaller cars. Plastic ends sometimes slip off.,"This will not fit in smaller cars like my BMW 330. Because it is plastic, it cannot hold a full rack of clothes. Also the ends are push on so if the slothes slide a lot, it will come off. All being said, it is an ok product for one or two trips, but I would buy a stronger one if I traveled a lot."
1,"Horrible, Horrible Packaging",Received it with a letter from Fed ex stating the packaging fell apart on them. Received it with Missing and Broken parts. Bummer for me i did not open it until 3 months after receiving.
2,too weak,The part of the bar that attaches it to the hanger in the car is much too weak and broke on first use. Plastic is not always good.
5,Kid Rock is the man.,"I have been a Kid Rock fan since 1996 when I went to his concert with some friends. Since that first concert I have been to every concert he has had in Michigan and Ohio. My sister sees his brother all the time at this restaurant called Secret Recipes. If anybody can find his Early Morning Stone Pimp CD I would love to hear from you......at threesheets2thewind@yahoo.com.... But as for the review this CD is what made me a die hard Kid Rock fan. My favorite song as you may be able to tell from my e-mail address is three sheets to the wind. Although the Cramper reminds me of a few friends I have. Kid Rock is the best artist out there right now, and as long as he keeps making records he will be for a long time."
4,It was cool but it could have been mixed a lot better,"THE SONGS WERE PRETTY COOL.I GOT THIS RECORDED ON A TAPE BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND THE CD ANYWHERE.I WOULDN'T RECCOMEND PAYIN' A FORTUNE FOR IT. THE BEST 2 SONGS WERE ""3 SHEETS TO THE WIND"" AND ""BALLS IN YOUR MOUTH"".""3 SHEETS TO THE WIND"" WAS THE MOST CREATIVE SONG I THOUGHT.""BALLS IN YOUR MOUTH"" WAS VERY FUNNY"". DEVIL WITHOUT A CAUSE WAS BETTER BECAUSE HE HAD MORE MONEY AND IT WAS MIXED A LOT BETTER. IF HE RE-RELEASES I HOPE HE DECIDES TO RE-MIX IT. TWISTED BROWN TRUCKER IS A LOT BETTER BAND THAN THE ONE HE HAD ON THIS ALBUM.HIS VOICE WAS TO HOLLOW ON THIS CD.I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE THE K-I-D IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE.KID ROCK IS A LYRICAL GENIUS.THAT IS MY OPINION ON KID ROCKS LP ""THE POLYFUZE METHOD""."
5,Classic Kid Rock,I had this CD when it first came out in 1993. I wanted to hear it once again so i purchased it and it did not disappoint! Kid Rock was like a Beastie Boy from Detroit back in the day!
3,Feathers Are Nice,"This toy spun around well until our cat caught it. Almost every time she let go we had to give it a tap to get it going again. If we wind it up for a while, there's enough tension that it can start again on it's own, but the speed is a little too fast for our one year old cat. The good part, though, is that the feathers aren't falling apart so they can be used by holding the stick without having to wind up the toy.Overall, it's better than some of the other $4 toys I've bought."
4,A little small,Although it is a small fire bit it was easy to put together and is attractive looking. I would buy the same style fire pit however I prefer a bigger one.
3,So-so fire pit,"Not NEARLY as sturdy as it is pictured. Cover SHOULD have (but, was not) included. Not the easiest fire to light.Amazon should consider to NOT sell products unless they are ready2use out of the box: works for Apple. When I make Amazon purchase I'm after instant satisfaction, NOT ""project""."
1,Didn't work for me,"Unfortunately this product didn't work for me. This may be because my allergy symptoms were quite serious (chronic sinusitis, fever, fatigue) as opposed to sneezing, runny nose etc."
1,Not the Shampoo,I thought I was buying the shampoo but it is actually a solution you wipe over the coat in between baths. It used to come as a shampoo. This is a watery solution you pour on a wash cloth and sponge bath your dog. I'm not sure how effective it has been. I've been bathing my puppy weekly and her dander does not seem to be effecting my son anymore.
2,Did not help with pet dander on me,"My doctor told me to get rid of my dog as I had developed an allergy to pet dander. I loved my dog and did not want to give her up. So I tried this plus another product and found that neither product helped me. I was therefore force to give my dog away. Within 60 days, my condition improved and I no longer suffer from this allergy."
3,"As far as I can tell, it works okay","This product is helpful, but it needs to be paired with other treatments (e.g., shampoo, air filter, anti-allergy spray) in order to really work well. It does do the job, just not as effectively as I would have wished. Don't think it's worth it for the price."
2,Did not see any difference,I used this product as directed and I did not see any difference. Maybe it takes a while to take effect.
3,It's so-so...,"I bought this book becasue it seemed like it would contain really good quotes. There were a few I really liked, but (all by celebrities), the quotes aren't the best I've read and don't really apply to my life. They're inspirational, but not the best."
4,Great Little Day Bag,"I love this bag: it's unobtrusive, but large enough for a book, notebook, compact camera, and a few other small essentials. I take it with me when running errands.It is sturdy and has a good number of different pockets that offer quick access to your things."
4,Very Good,"Very Good, thanks a lot! I really enjoy buy it!Very Good, thanks a lot! I really enjoy buy it!Very Good, thanks a lot! I really enjoy buy it!"
4,The First Step is Awating You...,"The Art & Practice of Creative VisualizationRed Wheel/WeiserOphiel has moved on to the Summerland, but his wonderful writings are still here, not only for us to enjoy but to gain insight and knowledge.

3,A medium-value overview of SqlServer 2005,"This book is a medium-value overview of the SqlServer 2005 new features. The overview is complete but the book does not goes in depth as I expected. I also don't like the writing style that is not very clear (for instance the APPLY Statement explanation is really poor) and the exposition that mixes DBAs related topics with Developers-Related topics.If you're searching for a quick overview of all new topics this is a good starting point, but don't expect to became a SQL new features expert."
2,Not what I was looking for,"If you're looking for a ""what's new in SQL Server 2005"" this book covers that. If you're looking for a reference book on the product, that goes into how to configure or upgrade from an earlier version--Keep Looking.The book explains new features in some detail. But, I want to know how to place the databases in a specific directory, how to set up replication--not mirroring; and how to install the software remotely. The book does not discuss any of that."
2,New Features only.,"Overview of new Features of SQL Server 2005. Does not address non-new features at all. Even the new features is just overview level, I guess with BOL, who needs details?"
5,Good book,It is a very good book. I was looking for a book for updating to from SQL 2000 to 2005.It is exactly what I need.
2,I would pass on this one,"If you have access to or know someone with the complete Daimos series, I suggest you go that route. This DVD cuts out way too much from the series to actually enjoy it. Of course if you have never watched the Daimos series, then this will do. But even then you will still ask the questions of why did it/this happen, when did it/this happen, etc. Not to mention the price of this just went up seven fold, not worth the current asking price."
3,unclear picture,"I collect carousel charms made of all kinds of materials. I would like to be able to see what the figures on this charm are, but the picture is so unclear that I can't tell if they are horses or something else. Too bad, if it were horses I would buy it."
5,"Forever Faithful Series 1,2, & 3","In my opinion Karen Kingsbury can't be beat. When I start a book of her's I can't put it down until I'm finished. She is a good Christian woman and her books reflect that of her. I also have all of the Baxter Family series, Women of Faith series, Forever Faithful series, and many more. She is the only author that I buy. Keep up the good work Karen."
3,Not what I was assuming...,"We all know what happens when one assumes.This item comes in a large box, filled with styrofoam. Once that is removed you have an item that once put together is the size of a large jewelry box.It took me longer to assemble the 3 wire bins then the cabinet itself. They fall apart very easily, again again & again.The cabinet went together easily and the directions were very helpful.I noticed the price has been lowered to 33.75 free shiping, I paid 37.50 with free shipping.In all honestly I would not pay more the 19.99 for this. It is cute and not a bad item, just very small and felt it was way over priced and surely not worth 100.00 retail!"
3,citadel combination bath storage cabinet,"I felt the quality of material was lacking and the cabinet was even smaller than I pictured in my mind. However, the small size could be an advantage for some bathrooms but the baskets only hold one good sized towel."
1,"Citadel Combination Bath Storage Cabinet with Three Wire Bins, White","The assembly accessory(8 pieces of wooden nails) were missing when it arrived. Since that was the first piece required for assembly, I did not have to open the entire package. It was returned the next day."
3,A Good Game!,"Backyard Baseball for the PS2 is a very fun and addicting game. The only bad part is that you don't all the Major Leaguers at the beginning of the game, you have to earn them. This game is easy to master and has a variety of different playing fields. If you liked the Backyard Baseball on the computer you should buy this game."
3,Backyard baseball,"This is a cute game with fun graphics but my only complaint is that it takes forever to load! I like this game because I can have a team that is built up of pro players and kids. In this game you can chooose the difficulty, which is good. If you pick easy it is great for little kids because it is so easy to get a hit."
1,"A mis-titled work - new title: ""Theory of Electric Motors""","This book was a huge disappointment. There is not a useful word in it for the electric motor end-user or designer needing an off-the-shelf electric motor.If you're looking for information on electric motors, like: lubrication, bearings, seals, cooling, standard mount styles and sizes, common motor abbreviations (TEFC, TEAO, etc.), how to size and choose a motor, energy efficiency, preventative maintenance techniques, or anything that might be even remotely practical, DO NOT waste your time on this book.McGraw-Hill Publishing would be wise to commission a new book called ""Electic Motor Practical Handbook"" covering the above mentioned topics. While I own many of McGraw's (usually excellent) ""Handbook"" series of titles, this is the first that I would rate a utter flop."
1,Could this be the same James R. Hendershot as below?,"the only glowing review comes from:James R. Hendershot could be a great books for James, but the rest of us.....James R. Hendershot Jr. is the president of MOTORSOFT which owns Magna Physics Publishing. He has a B.S. & M.S. in Physics.

4,strange critters,My daughter really likes these I think they are strange but they can change from fairy to critter. has small hair pieces not recommended for 3yrs. 4-8
2,not good too general,"way too general, and not updated enough for those who are not risk averse gen-xers"
2,"A little dull, a little obvious","I've read another book on flipping (Find It, Fix It, Flip It!: Make Millions in Real Estate--One House at a Time by Michael Corbett), and though that book was slightly gimmicky, at least it was entertaining.This book is slightly dull, and a lot of the suggestions are sort of obvious. I have not gotten completely through the book- so maybe there is some saving grace in there- however I'm having a hard time picking it up. So far I recommend my previous read more."
4,Great overalls,These are great. They are strong and durable and look real cute. I wish they had the crotch snaps but otherwise they're wonderful.
5,Nice and simple and to the point,"Rabbi Max Weiman did a great job in writing ""A Map of the Universe"". I have only started reading it and I am already understanding more about some of the more complicated teachings of Kabbalah already. This book is great for begineers, I suggest you get this book when you start off because the more complicated stuff will just confuse you later on."
4,Works as easy as turning on a light bulb.,"I ordered this plug-in with normal FREE shipping and it took a long time to arrival. However, when it did arrive, the installation was quick and it worked like a charm on my 1998 Jeep TJ."
4,Looking for this CD for years!!!!!!,"When I was younger (15), I ran across this CD by accident, but I fell in love with it none the less. Now after 6 years I finally found one that I can have on my own. The songs never left my head. Though I don't recommend singing them in public. They are really nice when you are mad at the world!"
3,"Hit-Or-Miss, Still Worth Getting","Definitely uneven, but much of what's good make this disk worth getting. Among the stuff worth getting (imho) are:Many Meanings of F*ckF*ck YouOrgasm AddictMcDonald's (Burgers & Bullets)I Wanna Be a Marine - Mondo Boffo, ScorpioNRA Medley (Ak-47 & Moose)No Safe Sex Allowed, andGod Has ResignedThey're scattered all over the disk, but are worth getting.Much of the rest of the album is good enough to listen to. Only the covers suck on this, and they're easily passed over."
2,Waste of money,"Don't waste your money on this, you'd be better served buying a ""Bob and Tom"" cd or even a ""Dr. Demento"" cd, heck ,even a ""Jerky Boys"" cd would get more laughs than this former beer coaster of mine got. I bought this brand-new from ""Orbit Music"" in beautiful South Bend, Indiana, and promptly sold it right back to them taking about a ninety percent loss in the process. Ugh!!Ugh!!"
3,Not your father's lounge album...,"A splendid mix of contemporary artists performing what is considered modern lounge music. What ever the heck that's supposed to be! I wanted something other than the usual Rat Pack gig. I only know Buster Poindexter of ""Hot, Hot, Hot""fame and his contribution is one of the best tracks. This is a cool sounding album, with inovative arrangements, but usually a lot of uninspired lyrics. Add a star when you listen intoxicated, subtract one when your sober."
4,"Nice rack, rubber band puzzle.","This rack is great, especially with the coated rods. Very nice arrangement to maximize hanging space. There are two large rubber bands to hold the rack in a locked position. The rubber bands seem to have been put on during assembly with no obvious way to replace when they wear out or break. Maybe it's a puzzle I haven't figured out yet, but I think I have a work-around when the time comes."
5,Best I've found,"I was frustrated with the flimsy drying racks I had and couldn't find anything better locally. After reading the reviews, I chose this and think it's great. You can't go wrong with it. Don't recall what I paid but I think the price may have dropped since I purchased it."
5,Super sturdy,"Six months ago I bought a cheap plastic drying rack from Target and within a few months it was dead. Then I bought this rack and it looks like it will survive into the next generation, holds a LOT of laundry and folds up for easy storing. Totally worth the money."
3,"Nice format, interesting, could possibly do with more research","I mostly bought this book because it contains information about my favourite manga, From Eroica With Love. I do enjoy the format and the way the book is ordered. Nice image of Klaus and Dorian too and I enjoy the description of Dorian.However, I think the author mixes Klaus up with Bannai when calling Klaus a ""police chief sent to trap him"" (him being Dorian) and ""a cop"", which is a bit of a turn-off. The weight put on the three superpowered teenagers also makes me think that the author only checked out the first book - after the second story they never again appear in the series. And, technically, the three appears long before Klaus, not after, which the ""things get even more complicated"" (when they show up) implies.This makes me slightly unsure as to the amount of research to this book. Still, it is entertaining to read."
4,Works but I wonder if It really fits,The wires work but you have to push really hard for the caps to fit on the engine. I don't know if this is a product defect but it's been a little over 6months and it's still working fine.
5,Entertaining Fun for little girl,"I bought this for my 4 year old niece who loves Yellow Submarine. She was more interested in the Jeremy figure, but my sister loved the John Lennon one! I also bought Paul for them too!"
4,Tubing an eye sore,"The drip system was easy to install. I would have preferred for the tubing to be connected where it would hug as close to the ground as possible to keep the 1/4"" lines from being so visible. The lines arc straight up from the head and are an eye sore."
3,smells weird,"this has a weird smell, it works pretty well but I almost try not to use it unless completely necessary because of the bad smell."
2,Union Entitlement vs Earning a Living,"Prejudiced and unobjective account of the CAMI joint venture in Ontario. The authors, (two sociology professors and a union bureaucrat) are guilty of sloppy research and pro-union bias. Their much emphasized ""unlimited access to the shop floor"" was apparently wasted. This book is a golden example of a wasted opportunity. Still, it serves as an example of why transplants usually stay non-union."
5,An eye opener as regards PCs.,"I wish I had read this book when I first bought my current computer; it is real eye opener. I don't know that I will buy another product or service without first reviewing it in a ""dummy"" book.Martin"
5,THIS REALLY KEPT ME FROM DOING SOMETHING DUMB,"This really helped me from buying something that I did not need or what. It kept me from spending more than I should, being a first time computer buyer. It has been several years since my first computer but I bet there is still a lot for a first time computer buyer."
2,"buying a comp for dummies, uh i don't think so!","this book is for the beginner (not even), but for a person looking for more info look elsewhere. He doesn't talk about specific companies, so a beginner doesn't know what good choices are there. he doesn't recommend any companies!! the beginner will have to find out for himself what companies are good and which are garbage. another thing that bothered me was the fact that every page has about 2 words, and there so spaced apart that the book could have been written in 100 pages instead of the 277 minus something like 25 pages for writting down stuff about the components to choose. btw, the stupid sarcastic jokes ruined my respect for him being a serious person and knowing much about buying a computer!"
2,Not really a Halloween DVD,I was expecting this DVD to more related to Halloween like the Alvin and the Chipmunks DVD but it was just episodes and not all really related to the season. I would not recommend.
4,Tom and Jerry: tricks & treats,Was nice to show my children something of quality cartoons other than robots and other mind blurring cartoons for them to watch
1,"Oh my, could it be any worse?","This item is absolutely a waste of money and time. I bought it just to take pictures for ebay. Quick and dirty, as it were. Well, it is horrible for stills and cannot create a decent image in even good lighting conditions. Blurry and poorly lit. I only wish the rating system had something less than 1 star."
5,A W E S O M E,"Amazon really needs to reissue this title. It is a really great tribute to Jimmy and all his music.Easy listening, nice beat, and of course...Jimmy!"
4,"If U didn't like Hendrix, now U probably will","I discovered this CD's as the soudntrack of a great video of strapped big wave surfing, (called ""Strappede,the Wake Up Call""). It just fitted so well that I thought: gee, I didn't know Hendrix played some stuff so cool , probably 'cause I have some cd's of him that I can't really say I'm hooked on. So in other words, if U're a real fan of Jimmy, U'd probably snare at this cd. If not, U'd probably have some good time playing at parties."
5,Where Are Beautiful People?,Did these guys just disappear? What a work of art! I have a tape copy of this album and it is haunting. Anyone out there have a cd copy? I'd be willing to pay a fair price for it.
5,way past tense...,"I am a dedicated rock and roller--since seeing The Beatles on Ed--but to be honest with you, I never was much into Jimi's ultra acid flecked jams--again, being a Beatle guy, I loved melody. What always seemed to grab my ear with Jimi, were his wonderful melodies--'Angel', 'Little Wing', 'Wind Cries Mary' etc.--though, Jimi is long gone (can you imagine him in an 'Unplugged' segment?!)this cd is a great way to get into the groove that is Hendrix--his melodies, his funk, his spirit. Dreamy, exotic and captivating--crank this up--perfect after a good surf session and a visit to Captain Hoppo."
5,"Hey, it's something new (sort of)","My brother, a diehard Hendrix aficionado, suggested this one. At first listen, I found it quite disturbing. It seemed like sacrilege. ""Clubatized"" Jimi?! Please tell me it ain't so! But, after a couple of listens it grew on me. The mix is done respectfully. Some of the songs are definitely worth pressing the repeat button on the CD player for on the way to work. Buy a used one, you can't go wrong."
4,So I'll never win the lottery now!,"I have been looking for this CD/Album forever. Just before X-Mas '99 I find it at a local record shop! It wasn't in the 'pre-owned' bin either, but in it's original shrink-wrap? I buy it and listen... and listen... and listen. Owning it/Having it is worth giving up a lifetime of leisure (well almost). It is 'Rilly Groovy'. Other artists similar to BP? I think they are unique. I thank Amazon.Com for showing the album cover and keeping the listing open even without product!"
3,"Grows on you, but I wouldnt exactly call it must-have music","I want to give this 4 stars but really it deserves a solid 3. The electronic mix sounds too much like tracks from the early 90's (which is when this CD was made). That's not necessarily a bad thing but you definitely have heard these beats and keyboards before if you were listening to electronic music in the 90's.On the other hand, the tracks are totally worth several listens because they do indeed creatively weave Jimi H into the tracks."
2,am i hearing something different?,"I was disappointed with this cd and am not sure what the other reviewers are hearing. There are no questions about why this is out of print, in my opinion. The bits of Jimi's guitar and vocals are the only exciting moments for me. The rest is mixed in such a predictable, unoriginal style that I could have gotten the same result while deaf from a 60's contact high. I found absolutely nothing original about the cd and would recommend passing on this one. The two-star rating is generous. I will trade my used copy back in for some original music from the master of guitar."
4,A nice curio for Hendrix fans but not to everyone's taste,"Originally issued in 1992 this CD features samples of various songs written or at least recorded by Jimi Hendrix, including Foxy Lady, Voodoo Chile, Spanish Castle Magic, The Wind Cries Mary, Hear My Train a Comin, Ezy Ryder, Wild Thing and Long Hot Summer Night all set amongst intricate, weaving ambient/acid house tunes created by the Beautiful People, a band supposedly led by Jimi's son.Whilst it's not perfect (I rated 2/9 tracks 5* and 3/9 tracks 4*) it's a nice item for any Hendrix fan to have. My personal favourites are If 60s was 90s and The Sea... Eventually.If you can, search out the later 1994 2CD issue in which you get an extra 6 remixed tracks, clocking in at over 42 minutes, including Rilly Groovy, Comin to Get You (2 remixes) and If 60s were 90s (3 remixes including a version nearly 11 minutes long by Youth). Unfortunately only 2 of the latter 3 mixes rate 5*, the rest of the extra CD remixes attracting a paltry 2 or 3*."
4,Hi out there !,"I found the cd !!! If anyone is interested ... drop me a message: matze@studserv.uni-stuttgart.de ;-) regards, matt"
4,"Easy to use, but not neccessarily quicker","The Easy Quick Jumper is a cinch to use, but may not actually take less time than the tried and true conventional jumper cables. Ok, sure you don't have to open the hood, but it actually takes anywhere from 10-15 minutes to charge up the battery in the dead car enough to start the vehicle. If you're in a hurry and feel confident in knowing what you are doing, jumper cables are the way to go. However if you want something that's safe, easy and are willing to allow a few extra minutes, the Easy Quick Jumper is not a bad alternative and works extremely well."
4,Was quite a popular item at the Christmas grab bag exchange,"One important warning to this nifty gadget though--- it takes 10 minutes to work. In my husband's opinion, that significantly reduced the ""cool factor"" since you had to wait a while for the jump to take doing it this way."
1,Dangerous!,"This product is poor made, very slow, thin cables. Takea look at the picture, do you really think it can jumpanything?"
3,did not work on a totally dead battery,I Got this to use when the lights got left on in our SMART forTwo and the battery got drained. Unfortunately it did not work and I had to resort to pulling up the passenger floorboard and jumping it with traditional jumper cables. This might have worked if we had noticed the lights on sooner and the battery was not so drained.
3,Works But Takes Time,"The hood release does not work on one of my cars and I haven't gotten around to having it fixed and then the battery died so I purchased this item. It worked but I needed to charge it for 4 cycles because 1 cycle didn't give the battery enough of a charge to turn over. Each time the green light would go on, I would take the plug out of the lighter of the car being charged and plug it back in which would make it start charging again. Each cycle is about 10 minutes so it took quite a while, but it was worth it considering the price of this item and what it costs to have a vehicle towed."
3,"Charger, not a jumpstarter.",Bought this for a reason not to get my hands dirty doing the old style technique. But it takes a long time to charge the other car you want to restart. So if you really dont know the person whos asking for a jumpstart your gonna think twice. Specially the gas is not cheap right now. It'll takes about 20 to 30 minutes to run your car connected to the other before it start. It is actually more than a charger than a jumpstarter cable.
1,After 40 minutes connecting...,My dead battery was in the trunk and I could not open the trunk lock manually so it seemed the best way is to connect a cigarette lighter to a cigarette lighter. I was hoping that at least the connection could give enough power to release the trunk door remotely. The trunk didn't not open even after a 40 minute charging.
1,waste of money,"We tried charging for 20 minutes from one car to the dead car, and still couldn't get the engine to start"
2,Jump Start thru cig-lighter,"The name is misleading in that you aren't ""Jump-starting"" your car. The current that a dead battery draws off of a running (donor) car will never make it through the cigarette lighter's fuse-protection. The fuse is there in case of a short that would melt wires, and in this case, it would detect the current as a short and blow the fuse.But the charging aspect seems straight-forward"
2,disappointment,"The product packing promise ""start your car in 5-10 minutes"" when it actually takes 40 minutes.Moreover- logically it's impossible to start your car in 10 min. when the current flow is only 6A"
1,Does not work,"Perhaps it might work, however, you have to leave it attached to both vehicles for so long that I just gave up. Also, YOU CANNOT RETURN IT. So you are stuck with it."
1,return it?,"this is a good idea, but it will not work for me. tried it three times, check instructions it will not work for me.tried to return it, you say no it contains hazardous material so how did it get to me through the mail.bottom line you have the $40.00 my son gave me and I have two yes two boxes of junk."
3,nice try,"This book is okay but it is kind of silly in parts. If you really want to read it, don't choose to go to the blacksmith's shop for a weapon because that leads to a very foolish ending. It was a little entertaining but I would suggest another CYOA like Daredevil Park, Silver Wings or Forbidden Castle."
5,"GREAT book! Funny, too!","....this was a wonderful book! What kid good at archery (or even not!) hasn't sometimes dreamed of an opportunity like the one Ellen Kushner presents here with such wit and graciousness? Not only _meeting_ Robin Hood, but actually getting to join his famous Merry Men? This whole series of books incarnated kids' dreams for at least two generations. Nice to see some authors are still keeping up with it."
1,Great concept/Poor execution,"I'm the kind of guy that will happily eat healthy items that are good for me, even if they don't taste so great. I sought out these bars because a)It's hard to find true whey protein bars with no soy. b) It's even harder to find 'green' alkaline-producing whey protein bars.These came and I immediately called the company to ask if they were stale. The date stamp showed they were still fresh, but the bars were as hard a rock. I could barely indent them with my fingernail and when I tried to take a bite, it broke off in chunks. As I tried to chew a piece, it moistened with my saliva just enough to stick to my teeth like epoxy. I literally had to take my fingernail and scrape it off my teeth. The response from the customer service rep at Biochem: ""Oh yeah, those are terrible. But, that IS the way they are supposed to be. They're not stale"".If you're looking for a 'green' whey protein bar, Green Plus makes a MUCH better, softer more palatable version."
1,Very Outdated.,"Books are truly only helpful when the software is actually stilling be used by the masses. 90% of the information in this book would be extremely helpful if we could roll the clocks back 6-8 years. Referring to the benefits of SD, referring to the benefits of using Tape, these are all very old school thoughts, that quite frankly have lost a lot of applicability by today's standards. Most folks today are recording to SSD or using SD Cards, this book was written before the advent of such ideas, thus leaving you quite behind and in the dark."
2,don't waste your money,"While this book covers the basics, it doesn not cover any of the maddening aspects of Final Cut Pro, like why scrolling text bleeds off the frame, the complexity of importing still photos, FCPs inablilty to play well with non-mac files, why you need to create a ""scratch disk"" instead of just working directly off your drive, etc. What the book covers can be more easily picked up on one of the numerous, free, on-line video tutorials."
5,Favourite classic,I grew up with Sharon Lois and Bram and 25+ years later my little toddler is enjoying this great trio. Travellin' Tunes has all the classic Sharon Lois and Bram tunes!!
4,"Worth it, to get to Catspaw","Warning: This book is not as good as Snow Queen. It has a lot of the same lovely, anthropological attributes that Snow Queen shines with, but certain elements (ie the cardboard villain Quicksilver) are not quite as original.I do highly recommend this book for two things, which are 1) Cat. He is a great character and this book is spoken in his own unique voice, and 2) 'Catspaw,' the sequel to this book, is full-on excellent, and you will enjoy it more if you read this book.The other complaint I have is the cover art. I mean, who is that supposed to be? Cat is a teenager in this book, and that dude looks 40. The original cover art was uglier, but at least it looked like Cat. The cover art for 'Catspaw' was so much better -- did the fabulous Micheal Whelan do this one too, and if so, was he half-asleep?"
3,"Fun, if fluffy reading","This story explores the use of the telepathy rather nicely. Mrs. Vinge imagines a compelling plot and her characters are original and many-dimensional.Unfortunatly, Psion falls victim to a common trend in 1980s Science Fiction- cliches and stupidity.The author apparently feels compelled to stick certain things in the book, even if they don't always fit. The hero's love intrest is taken by the hero's enemy, the hero is hurt seriously and cared for by the love intrest, the hero kills someone, ect.Also, Mrs. Vinge's book is a light read. There are plot twists, but the book doesn't make on think. The subject of telepathy could be used to explore certain tendancies of human nature, or privacy laws. But it isn't.All in all, a well rounded book. Read it on vacation or on the beach."
3,Maybe I missed something but,"I don't know what all the hype is about. I bought the book mostly because of the reviews. The topper being this was something they'd read years ago and it stayed with them.It isn't a bad book by any means. It just isn't that great, either. Not one of those ""you pick it up and then can't bear to put it down"" sort of things. It's an o.k. read with characters that aren't all that likeable.Like most things, it all comes down to a matter of taste. There are books I've read in past years that have stuck with me, making me track them down to read again and again. This book isn't one of them."
4,Right on Schedule !!,"This is the right place Ozric should be at the time. It is a time of transition, with the roster changes, and Brandi in the mix. This is a very good album, generous Ozric soundscapes. As others have mentioned we could use a little more guitar, hear that Eddie. Still nothing quite like it yet, so I will be a Full-Out Ozric fan until someone else can take this type of formula and use it like Ed Wynn."
4,"Holy ""Whole Lotta S*** Going On"" Batman","Good grief, talk about your techno,rock,new age on acid with a few doses of fusion jazz and classical jazz!! this CD defies description. It is startling and gorgeous and furious and all that! Pink Floyd meets Eleventh House with Larry Coryell. One of the most interesting and technical CD's I have ever heard. With all that is going on-synths and overdriven guitars and percussion galore; this a feat for the ears. Get ready, not for the faint of heart. A true musical journey. Have to listen to it 6-7 times just to ""expect"" any of the musical twists and turns. If you like avante garde rock you will love it, if you like hard edged fusion, you will love it. If you like music that you cannot memorize, you will love it. WOW"
3,Sounds more like their older music,"My first experience with OT was the Spirals In Hyperspace CD, which I really liked. I tried some of the older stuff, but really didn't care for it as much. This CD reminds me of their older sound, so I'm a little disappointed. Long-time OT fans may like it, however."
3,High-tech grooves,"3 1/2OT's suave use of keyboard trance techniques always helped set the band apart from many neo-proger's; even if it was a sound that became predictably hypnotic over the years, the band is still as reliable as ever for their signature progressive trance, if overcompensating with electronic manipulation."
4,Wow!,"Not bad for a new start. Spacebase, Ping, and Bolshem are some of the best I've heard from this band. Got all of their CDs. Rock On!!!!!!!!"
5,New Ozrics,"The Ozric Tentacles have gone through some major lineup changes in the last few years. Specifically to address a previous post about the lack of flute. John is no longer in the band. I am sad to see him go, because I enjohed his contribution to the band.The new CD follows along in the tradition of the last few, and is nice to listen to. I just wish that they can bring back some of the older members, because the live show is not what it used to be."
5,Great new CD,"At last!!! And a good listen too. It's not quite as ground breaking as some of the previous CDs, but it's certainly not to be sniffed at. There's some wonderful moments in there, some cool synth sounds, along with some familiar and gorgeous guitar work too. All in all, worth the wait. Great summer driving music!"
2,Shows a marked decline for Ozrics,"Not the disc to start with if you want to explore this band. Here, Tentacles is pretty much reduced to Ed Gwynn and a bunch of occasional contributors, at the cost of cohesion and consistency. Throughout, the disc reveals a muddy mix and a big hole where the bass should be. Not a single standout track on this disc, nothing that would stand up to ""Jurassic Shift,"" Erpland"" or ""Waterfall Cities."" It all sounds like home studio noodling. A rare miss, and hopefully Mr. Gwynn will get the band back together with a real rhythm section and get back to making Ozrics music. By comparison, this is a pale imitation."
2,Why did they call this an Ozric release?,"No Joie, no Jumping John, no Zia, no Rad, no Schoo, no Seaweed, no bass on most of the songs (unless you count synth bass as bass), more like half a Nodens Ictus project. When Ed married Brandi 'Yoko Ono' Wynne, she proceeded to sack every remaining member of the band that had talent,and this is the sad result. When Ozrics were in their prime back in the eighties and nineties, they would perform mind-bending psychedelic excursions with incredibly clever song titles. On this CD, the song titles are just ridiculous. Avoid. Get everything previous first."
3,A good overview but a boring read,"This work is a basic overview of the Near East spanning the massive time frame between 3000BC to 330BC. The book touches on all major points of interest in the time period. However, it contains many things which will bog down the average reader. For example, it contains lengthy descriptions of what must be almost every pot fragment found in Anatolia. For those of you who don't care about every student's notepad found in Sumeria, you can obviously skip these parts. Still it tends to decrease the readability of the text as a whole."
2,Not the best,"This book focuses way too much on religon and not enough on giving practical tips on organization and time management. I would not recommend, there are better books out there."
2,Not as helpful as I was hoping,"I bought this hoping to learn to streamline my day a little better, but felt like it was redundant with other things I have read, and didn't teach me much about appreciating my days as mom more. If this is the first book you pick up for learning home management, then it would suffice, but only for novices."
5,Great First Glimpse,"Adventures of a Feng Shui Detective is easy to read and a fun way to discover feng shui. It was the first book I read on the subject and I found the writing to be accessible, open, engaging. It explained many of my intuitive feelings about design made me want to further explore how feng shui could bring some balance to our home."
3,Heard a lot of this before,"It is interesting to know how actors prepare. But each and every actor must discover that process on their own. I think a person not very familiar with the process would find this book enlightening and intriguing. However, people in the field are familiar with homework techniques, different methods, and various training schools. So, if you're in the field - this is probably something you've already heard before."
3,Construction = Problemo,"This book is a must have. The series was great.The bad news is that the actual construction of the book itself is abysmal.They say this is ""essential,"" but scrimp on quality? The original comics were in color--this is in B & W! The cover fell of and I had to re-glue it on myself. The pages themselves are made of shoddy, ultra-cheap material.C'mon, Marvel. I'd of gladly put out a few more bucks for quality. Bad decision."
3,Entertaining...,"I bought this volume of the Marvel Essential series based largely on the reviews I read. It was a fun romp through the 70's Marvel world, even though I have not been a big Godzilla fan over the years. I was worried early on that this would be a different version of the Hulk, with Dum-Dum Dugan replacing General Thunderbolt Ross, but Dugan actually showed character growth early on in this run. There were some parts that were pretty hokey, but it was a fun read and worthwhile."
4,seems very good,"pretty good price for something that seems so well made. the thing is solid, works well, powerful, etc. the only thing that I could say that's negative is just that the paper holder is a little primitive seeming. It's not HARD to put the paper in, but it doesn't pull the paper taught (should it? i dont know) and Im sure it could be designed to be easier. That said, i dont think the mechanism will ever break, so that might be the tradeoff. The dust collection seems to work ok - obviously it wont get everything, but i also havent hooked it up to the shop vac either. Anyway, this seems like a really good value - powerful enough for heavy duty use, yet smooth enough for the finesse needed for fine woodworking. I am using it for both..."
3,you need flat fingers and a vacuum cleaner,"I used to have a DeWalt radom orbital disk sander. It was wonderful except it wouldn't do corners. It had the velcro disks and a great dust collector.I sold it in order to justify buying this one. I'm not long winded so I'll cut to the chase: You have to have skinny fingers in order to release the paper hold down latches. Once you release them it's easy to load, however. The unit vibrates a bit and after a while it feels like my hand has gotten a massage. The dust bad might as well not be there because most of the dust is on the work piece or on the bench or in the air. I can hook up my dust collector but sometimes that's not possible. I'm disappointed because I've heard great things about Porter Cable. I think I'm going to return it and buy the DeWalt."
5,Solid & Well Built,"I am a firm believer in buying the best quality, especially in tools. Most of my power tools are 18 volt DeWalt. I need a sander for my deck handrail, (counting all three rails on it, we are talking close to 300 ft!) I needed a corded sander and this fill the bill. Only fault I can see, this represents something I don't want to do!! But it will sure get the job done. Great quality!!"
5,Porter Cable 342K Palm Sander,Excellent quality as expected from Porter-Cable.Also the best price was on Amazon.com.Highly recommend Amazon.com and Porter-Cable !!!
3,Porter-Cable 1/4 Sheet Sander,"While this sander performed as good as I had hoped and expected it could have beed designed a bit better by making it easier to insert the sheets of sand paper and by adding a variable speed feature. What I do appreciate is the fact that the replacement paper is quite inexpensive as a person can cut pieces from regular sheets of sandpaper. Also, by using square sheets of paper it is more effective in sanding inside square corners. (When compared to the circular palm sanders)"
4,I Wish I had that Doll...........,"Another wonderfully done book on composition dolls; photography is excellent and many 'minty' dolls are pictured. I would liked to have seen a few more accessories,but the beauty and variety of the dolls makes up for it. This is definitely a keeper and is an outstanding addition to any compo, or American doll, collectors' library."
5,Dolls and Accessories of the 1930s and 1940s,"Given to my daughter for Christmas - good reference book for her collection of dolls, clothing and other doll accessories."
1,An insult to the Brotherhood,"Not everyone in this show is bad (e.g. Elizabeth Siddal), but the general treatment of the pre-raphaelites is so annoying that I couldn't bare to watch more than one episode.The problem clearly is that the people who made the show were trying too hard, way too hard, to make these painters seem ""cool"" and revolutionary to a modern audience which, it is assumed, cares little to nothing about the pre-raphaelites. Therefore, the painters are turned into caricatures, the historic events are exaggerated, and the script is dumbed down. It's a pity, because the PRB really does have a fascinating story to tell. To add injury to insult, the show's rock-baroque music is really awful and completely out of touch with pre-raphaelite art.I highly recommend reading ""The pre-raphaelites in love"", instead. And if you want a good art show, check out BBC's The Impressionists drama series."
2,"Great subject, poor execution","My wife and I are fascinated by the pre-Rafaelite movement and were keen to watch the series. More so our disappointment at being presented with an over-ac6ed costume drama with banal dialogue. The pre-Rafaelites challenged everything in society and the series shows this, however it fails to develop either empathy or concern for the characters. Instead it is a cleverly constructed series of artistic shots of Dickensian London and the differing clothing of the various classes. Worst of all, it is just plan boring."
2,Substandard!,"I ordered the decal because of the great design, but it was not what I expected. It was barely visible when I installed it in the left rear car window - the colors were not bold or distinct. Further, several weeks after putting it on, one corner started to peel up. The decal was almost invisible from the outside and barely noticeable from the inside. Sad. It would look really nice had they done the printing and adhesion right. It might show up if put on a white or extremely light surface."
3,Not good for car,"I didn't realize when I purchased this product that it's on a clear background. Therefore, it didn't show up when I stuck it to the window of my car."

3,Amazon's Book Cover is misleading,"The nude woman bookcover on Amazon's page seems to imply this is perhaps a racy type book which couldn't be further from the truth.It is a series of anecdotes about a @1900 English fictional couple in their 40s I'd guess who are childless.Very tame short humorous stories told by the husband about his life with his wife, Eliza. The couple are like an English version of George Burns and Gracie Allen.A gentle chuckle of a book. Get it free from MobileRead."
4,Adobe Freehand MX,"The latest (last?) Freehand upgrade as published by Adobe retains all of the benefits of Freehand 10 (the intuitive pen tool with the Control - Alt modifiers, the ability to drag objects from Freehand to InDesign, multipage documents), but notably adds a much improved ""properties > object"" panel that gives access to all of the characteristics of any of the selected objects in a document.The enclosed Macromedia and Adobe documentation is slim, but adequate. This program remains my favorite vector drawing program."
2,Questionable research,"A nice book with heartwarming and meaningful stories. HOWEVER, at least one of the stories is of questionable origin. According snopes.com (a site that investigates urban legends), the story about some Marines giving up opportunities by a reporter to call home in order to let another member make the call or to call the family of a fallen comrade, did not happen. Snopes quotes a news agency's denial of the incident."
1,"Good Topic, Poor Delivery","I am currently researching the use of a stochastic simulator for a Ph.D and as such make a point of seeking out any literature in this regard. Regarding the book, the concept is good but the delivery very poor. The book is expensive when you consider the size, knowledge content and quality of presentation. The book itself is also poorly bound and presented. The author has a tedious way of presenting the subject, which is unfortunate since the market requires better efforts at explaining the benefits of using stochastic models.The only thing of value in the book is that a portfolio needs to be constructed in such a way to allow for market variability. The days of relying on a straight line calculation, extrapolated out forever are gone. If you can grasp my last sentence then there is no need to buy the book."
4,"""Classical Pop"" is in the season ,baby !","This CD is not only for Christmas but is for everyone who believes that pop and classic is alive during Christmas.The album reflects a blend of the traditional tunes being sung by talented artistes around from old to new.It's one of the albums that you wouldn't wanna miss this holiday season because its a collection of songs that truly fills the air with high spirits through upbeating music,yet it needs a little more umpphh...to it because there are 2-3 songs that are not really up tp the standards.All in all, it would be a great CD for listeners who wants something new .Merry Christmas and Deck the Halls!"
3,"Works, but only for a rechargeable battery!","This Wii Remote glove works well as a glove -- it improves the grip on the remote -- but only get it if your remote has rechargeable batteries of the type such that you put the whole remote into a charging cradle. That's because it's nearly impossible to replace AA batteries with this thing on, and it's a pain to take off and put back on. It has a hole in the back that works with the kind of recharging cradle where the remote leans against the electrodes. It doesn't have a hole to support the kind of charger where you plug a USB cable in the back."
3,cool skins,Remote & Nunchuk Skins are a great color and have a nice grip. They are just hard to put on.
1,Very poorly made!,"Looks good, but tore the first time it was removed to replace batteries. The skin is also not compatible with recharging systems, so it would need to be removed every time batteries need to be replaced. Not recommended!"
4,The Price Was Right,"The price was the determining factor. We do a lot of female/male competing, so I got the pink and blue.The part that covers the Nunchuk gives you a better grip, but I prefer the textured skin that comes with the remote."
4,Good product,"I was not sure what to expect when I ordered these inexpensive skins - I was pleasantly surprised to see that they are quite well-made. They slip on easily and stay on. The silicone is not flimsy or too thin.I give it only four stars as the product image is not quite accurate: the skins have a darker blue face. They are good-looking, however, just not what I was expecting.I would absolutely buy this product again - in fact, I already have. I purchased another set in pink for my other Wii remote and nunchuk."
3,Wii Remote Skins,"I purchased the Wii skins, and I like them. I like that I can tell the difference between the ones my husband uses and mine. The only thing I don't like, is when I want to use the Wii steering wheel for the Mario Kart game, I have to take them off, because they don't fit in the wheel. That's a pain, but otherwise, they're ok. I also find a little resistance when I have to put them into my jacket of the Active Sports leg strap when i go to workout. Overall, I'd have to say they're worth the price, but not really necessary."
2,Will not fit into other accessories with skin on,I gave it 2 stars since it does glow in the dark. But the OEM skins provided with the Wii are much thicker and better.
4,covers,"My son really loved these green covers. The only thing is they are difficult to remove to change the batteries in the remote, but would recommend them."
1,Not quite...,"While the Wii remote and nunchuk skins did indeed glow, they were nothing like the picture. Instead of that cool one-tone garden green, they were two-tone bright green. Definitely not what was pictured."
3,wrong color,"Don't be fooled by the color. It is pink, but it's two toned (light pink on the outside and darker pink in the middle). If two-toned isn't what you want, then don't purchase this product by this vendor. I would have searched a little bit longer and/or contacted the vendor before purchasing this again."
5,This is the book for finding GOLD in Hatchers Pass,If you plan on looking for GOLD in Hatchers Pass this is the book you need it has all the mines and locations of where to find it....
5,Great Stuff,If everything about the Old Testament is about Jesus then Kevin Conner proves there is no end to the revelations of Jesus found in the temple of Solomon. There is alot of good stuff in this book and it brings light to some of those obscure New Testament scriptures.
4,The Temple of Solomon,"I used this book in preparation for a college credit course in theology offered at Church. The information is well researched. The author has a very interesting presentation and it is a very easy read for a ""text"" book. Read and enjoy!"
4,"If you meet the Buddha, you must kill the Buddha...","One of my favorite installations in the series, Ogami Itto's standard advance fee is paid to him in five installments, a welcome change of pace for fans. But never fear, Daigoro is still up to his babycart tricksFinally Ogami meets his match in obscure utterances and is defeated by a monk. The entire series is fraught with Buddhist teachings but this installation makes an extra effort to explain them to Westerners"
5,I love the new Lone Wolf and Cub movies cause now there are dub in english.,"What can I say, if you see one movie you must see all of the seven movies. The best Japanese movies ever."
3,Good general evangelical Bible Dictionary,"I bought this book several months ago and have used it many times comparing it to John L McKenzie's Dictionary of the Bible. On the whole this Bible dictionary is excellent, its only flaws are that some articles are superficial and on some subjects the author's evangelical theology clouds the meaning of bible words and ideas.It is well printed, on good paper, and it is hard covered. To top it off, it is inexpensive, so if you are looking for a bible dictionary that is going to be useful and cheap this is an excellent choice. If you want something more comprehensive and less theologically driven then John L McKenzie's Dictionary of the Bible is a better choice, and it is not much more expensive."
2,Lacking Key Verses,"This book skips over few verses that are key to Jesus ministry. For example Matthew 17:20 Start off with Jesus explain the power of the mustard seed, then it skips to Matthew 17-22. Thus eliminating verse 21: ""However , this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.""..Look through this book and see what other verses have been skipped that are vital to the ministry of Jesus and you will understand."
4,Response,"This product was received in excellent condition. Some of the pages were creased but all in all the description was correct, I received the product within the shipping timeline. Excellent experience."
1,look good work bad.,Anyone who recommends these boots cant be working very hard. I bought a pair to work in (im a carpenter) and within 2 months the leather had almost completely seperated from the sole. It wasnt stitched or anything. Just glued in. I noticed one day when i waz splitting wood and felt something stabbing the bottom of my foot which turned out to be a stick. Both boots have the same problem so im inclined to say its just poor construction. Im sticking with wolverines. Had a pair for 5 years before they wore out.
5,Highly Recommend!,"If you are interested in public health and infectious diseases, this is a must read. Paul Farmer has a way of explaining things that just make sense and provides solutions that seem so simple.... if only it were that easy. There was little I could disagree with in this book, Dr. Farmer is spot on. This read is worth the time."
3,Not for the common public,I had to read this book for my medical anthropology course. I feel like I learned all I needed to learn about the book within the first three or four chapters. Many of the topics are repetitive which makes it very slow to read. Don't buy it if public health is not your interest because you will find it long and boring.
5,Thanks,This book arrived on time and in excellent condition. It was also appropriately packaged. Thank You.
3,Infections & Inequalities by Paul Farmer,Too long . Written with sientific dicipline & detail and burdened by too much specialized medical terminology for the popular reader . The idealism is admerable and the conclusion are justified but it speaks to the medical profession more than to the general public . A slow diffucult book to read . Sombody else should write the same book for the popular reader and for leaders in public policy .
3,"careless errors, mediocre conclusion","By claiming ""social reform,"" Farmer contradicts his stance as an American citizen: Haiti has no money to support its own citizens, that's why the US and others are doing Haiti's job. But, the US has to care for its own citizens as well therefore has to first work on its own AIDS patients within its boundary. If the US does that as its social reform, Haiti instantly dries up.Irritating mistakes somehow got through inspection: PAligre Dam? PEligre? (P. 174) PuertO Plata? PueltA? (P. 119)"
4,Good feel in your hand,"I like the way this brush grips in my hand and tough to slip off even with all the soap and scrubbing violence.PROS- Good grip- Brush strong enough, yet soft enough to not damage anything- Clear design let you know soap levelCONS- The resevoir and brush both have same twist off design. The problem with that, is when you try to twist off the soap refill lid, you twist off the brush as well. My lid is tighter than the brush and it comes off each time I try to just refill the soap. Not a show stopper, but can be annoying at times."
4,Perfect Size & Function!,What more could you ask for in a little brush? It is the perfect size for the kitchen (and bath). OXO has made another quality product.
4,Excellent,"I stopped using sponges and find that these things are the best for cleaning dishes, pots, and pans. Pour in the soap and you are good to go. Plus, with this one, you can buy the replacement brushes. There's no need to keep buying the entire scrubber over and over."
3,Breaks easily!,"My mom bought one of these, and when I found out that a rent house I was about to move into did not have a dishwasher I headed to Bed Bath & Beyond to pick one up. They sell for $4.99 there and you can use a 20% off coupon. First, the plastic device that holds the spring in place so you can push down and squirt soap out came off and is impossible to get back on. This happened about one month of doing dishes by hand. Then, while pushing on the button to dispense soap, my finger went through the material and broke it. I still use it as a scrubber, which works great. Also, understand that this is coming from someone who does all dishes by hand, unfortunately! I still can't decide if I want to buy a new one, but I think I might because sponges get so much bacteria in them. Good luck! Don't forget...$4.99 at Bed Bath & Beyond."
2,brush is good but.....,the soap dispensor is a huge dissapointment! i'm buying a stick brush without the soap stuff.
1,"May be chili & salt, but NOT CHIPOTLE!","These terrible salty nuts are another example of Emerald brand's yucky stuff! They are very heavily seasoned - to the point that you CANNOT taste the nut, and the seasoning is just salt and chili powder. Not even a good bar nut. Don't bother! Also, Amazon tells me no exchanges, no refunds, so this was an expensive lesson!"
3,Based on a CBS Special of the Same Name,This script is based on a CBS Schoolbreak Special done a few years back for television. There are 6 female parts and 2 male parts. A 17-year-old girl who thinks she's pregnant experiences a large dose of reality in coming to grips with the impact it could have on her life and relationships.
4,What Are the Odds? by Orkin,"This book is a goldmine if you are seeking to beat the houseon a bet. The author provides practical strategies forunderstanding randomness, the chaos theory and payoff matrices.There is an extensive discussion on how the house wins andthe frequency of winnings. The book provides a transitionstrategy for profiling chaos in a deterministic fashion.It is a good value for readers interested in the practicalimplementation of the laws of probability in everyday life."
4,The Last Season!!!,"This 6th season completes the set. Not as funny as seasons 3, 4 and 5. Still good though."
5,Good old times,It's really refreshing watching this easy going old times tv serial!A good medicine for the extra - violent nowadays shows...
3,Pretty Good!,This is a really good season. I gave it 3 stars because I didn't like the way it ended.
3,Pretty good show,"I bought the entire series last year here on Amazon for $25 and I'm amazed that now they are selling each individual season for $12.99. While some of the episodes are just ""ok"", it was a bargain at $25. I wouldn't feel quite that way if I spent full price because lots of the episodes are weak. All in all a good series especially compared to the nonsense on TV now a days."
1,this is lame,the 6th season SUCKED and you people know its true compared to the first few seasons which were great!Dont buy this trash but buy the other ones!
3,"The least favorite, but still an collectors item.","If your a Sanford and Son fan and you have all 5 seasons, get this one to complete your collection and feel proud of yourself.However, if you had to choose which one to get, stick with the earlier sets of S&S;."
5,Making driving games much easier...,Sure it may just be psychological but I do find it easier to race with one of these in my hands.It really does make it easier to hold the remote and the price is ok.I would recommend it for anyone that has any racing games!
4,Jackson Retrieved from the Dust of History,"""Standard"" treatment of American History in school has a hazy blank between Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. This novel sticks close to the historical Jackson yet makes good reading and has a surpise ending. No peeking at the last Page!"
4,Good Subject - Fine Result,"Despite the minor inaccuracies, Byrd gives us a good look at Jackson, an important character in out history and certainly one of the most decisive and colorful. He also paints a landscape of the Washington politics of the time and he seems to have captured the essence of both. The fictional characters are also nicely fleshed out and are of considerable interest. Of particular note is the characterization of John Coffee, Jackson's friend and lieutenant, a real person, cunning and amiable. Overall, quite an entertaining and interesting read. I have not read ""Jefferson"", but I intend to do so after having read ""Jackson""."
3,Interesting subject matter but a slow read,"Unlike his previous book JEFFERSON, Max Byrd has written a new book that regards an interesting enough subject matter but is really slow to read. Perhaps my expectations were to high after reading his well researched novel regarding Jefferson, and that just might be the exact problem. This reader was distracted by the historical errors. Anyone impressed with any of Byrd's previous works will remain unimpressed with this one."
2,Disappointed,"The condition of the book was not as it was written. The cover was nearly falling off, makes it difficult to keep the book togeter. The binding was disintegrating as well"
1,Frustrating and unclear text...,"This text book has drawn howls of protest from my fellow class mates based on its impenetrable and inaccessible style. There is no step by step explanation of concepts or proper derivations - you are forced to plough on through the chapters with an increasing sense of disconnectedness from the material being taught. This is a shame since I believe the authors are leaders in their field - I suppose there is a true difference between knowing your subject and being able to convey that knowledge.The text jumps from introductory concepts to advanced material without laying the groundwork for that leap. I would recommend Fundamentals of Corporate Finance (Ross, Westerfield and Jordan) in preference if you want to maintain your sanity and come to grips with the material."
2,confusing and unwieldy,"I am sad to report that this book is an inadequate and frustrating introduction to finance. Important concepts are buried; there are no derivations; there are few clear explanations of concepts; and definitions of terms are sparse at best. The many jokes come as a welcome relief from the generally poor writing, but provide no educational value. The book is rendered even more confusing because its organization is wayward, jumping unpredictably back and forth between topics. Overall, I find this textbook to be incredibly opaque, and I constantly have to supplement my readings elsewhere. If you have had prior exposure to finance, then I suspect this textbook will be far more digestible, but if this is your first exposure to the field you may wish to try an alternate text."
1,Lacking Full Explanations,This book leaves me with more questions about finance than I have answers. Who do the authors think they are writing for? It surely is not the beginner MBA student. It seems like words are expensive because they do not fully or even partially explain concepts. Finance is difficult but it should not be impossible. I should not have to read and reread to figure out what the heck they are talking about. Maybe they should serve as advisors to this text and let someone who knows how to write actually write the book. These guys may be leaders and brillant but they are poor communicators. I'm not thrilled with my professor either. Is he a cheerleader or a teacher?
1,CONFUSING!!!!! Horrible text!,"Materials are not systematically presented.Recommend Ross's Fundamentals of Corporate Finance, Corporate Finance and Modern Financial Management."
2,Untitled,This book was one of the worse books we had in our MBA program in University of Toronto. It is very confusing and vague. Some chapters are very short and don't cover a subject completely and like typical MBA books there is no answer to end of chapter questions. So you have to be a MBA student and rely on you professor for the answers to the end of chapter questions. There are much better books in the market for learning finance. For the whole course I had to study from other books to learn a subject.
2,Don't buy this unless you have to,This book was very hard to follow and does not spell things out very effectively. I had to get this book for class and I hated it. I felt like I couldn't find anything when I wanted it.
3,"Good text, serious editing problems","I thought the text was well organized and well explained, but a lot of the problems in the book required concepts that the text didn't explore. On top of that, the CD that came with the text had some serious editing problems where information in problems in the text didn't match what was provided in the CD. The notes on the CD were laced in editing errors. The book was overall pretty good, but it is frustrating when you encounter problems where the concepts weren't really laid out in the chapters."
2,a disappointment,Brazilian Portuguese was not what I was looking for.Too traditional in its approach.Tedious to work with.
2,Desert Star,"This is my first time reviewing a book and I hate that it has to be a negative one. But, I agree with MCP, the book was one long epilogue. Based on the the book's description I expected this book to focus more on Tony and BeBe's story. I read the first book and the author did not portray Jill as needy and whiney as she was in the second book. This story had such potential, but I think the author missed the mark this time. However, I will still read other books by Ms. Carrington, we all fall short sometimes."
1,Had to be a rush job,"I read and enjoyed 'A Special Place', which is where the character Jill Alexander was first introduced. I really don't know what happened between the first book and this one, it's as if Jill fell off a horse and became a whining, insecure, weak woman. I find it hard to believe that same person wrote both books. The first book ended with Jill and Bebe engaged to handsome brothers but this book begins with Jill needing to hook-up Bebe. The author must have been rushed to release another book and this is the result."
2,Desert Star,"Desert Star is a 360 page epilogue to the author's first book A Special Place. I'm not sure why the book was written and then published in this format. The main character, Jill is written to be a strong, talented, young entrepreneur, but she comes across as a clingy woman who needs constant reassuring. I found all the characters of this book flat, boring and predicable."
3,Too Needy,"I found Jill Alexander to be much too needy. Her desire for everyone around her to be just as happy as she and Kyle is one thing, but her constant plea ""Don't leave me"" became annoying. It was still a nice read with good intimate detail."
1,At least act like you care,"I had previously ordered three other literary posters. They were carefully rolled and when I opened the package they were in perfect shape.This last one was shipped alone in a package that cost about 6.00 which made the poster twice as much. Well, I wouldn't have cared except that poster had been folded in half and then half again. Some idiot did a real number on it and now I have to pay for shipping it back. I will never order from this company again. What a waste of time and effort."
3,"Interesting, if confusing, beginning","Takuya Fujima, Deus Vitae vol. 1 (Tokyopop, 2004)In Fujima's dark, Terminator-esque version of the future, humans have been extinct, replaced by a race of artificial humans called the Solenoids. Or so the Solenoids think-- it turns out some humans still exist, and have been living off the grid for some time. When a human infiltrates one of the four very hearts of Solenoid society, things start to go, shall we say, a little awry. Drenched in sex and violence, Deus Vitae isn't a manga for the kiddies, but adults who like the raunchier action flicks will likely get a real kick out of the first volume in the series. ***"
2,Sub par,"I love Roses are Red and have supported them for some time now. Since their first cd came out ive been to almost all their shows (since i live 30 minutes from rochester their hometown) and bought their stickers and hoodies. Ive talked with the guys and they are very cool.Now with the cd. Its very plain. It seems uninspired and lost is the energy from Conversations. I loved Conversations and that it could use a little touch up on vocals but the new vocals seem so fake. Too much computer editing and way too many boring rock added in. I am very disappointed (add it to the list cough thursday and atreyu cough) with this release. I will still support them and check out the shows but Im not very happy with the direction they have taken. Gone are the screams, the energy, the drive. Maybe next time RaR."
2,"Jimmy eat world, I smell a lawsuit","Melodic, post-emo working class rock with just a touch of pop-punk flavor. Had it not been for the fact that every song on this entire record sounds like it was lifted from 'futures', I'd be more willing to put in a recommendation. Remember kids, just say no to drugs, and stealing is wrong."
3,Not as good as his other novels,"I enjoyed the novel, though it was not half as interesting as his previous one. Not much emphasis was given to the Christian characters: Nero and his cronie Tigellinus shine, and so does Sabinus. The book is basically about Nero and his crimes: the murderous Messalina, his cruel and scheming mother Agrippina, his wife (he killed her too) Poppea. The book does not explain in detail what happened to Seneca. Some attention is given to Claudius, in the beginning, before Nero takes over."
2,Reader beware...,"This author presents this novel as a ""new"" kind of story: a ""documentary"" novel. It's true that the author's vast knowledge of history is put to good use. The book is vividly detailed and presents a colorful and perhaps accurate picture of the time and events it depicts. However, early on I became aware of a political and religious ""agenda"" lurking behind the supposedly objective tone of the narrative. This agenda becomes more and more obvious as the story advances. I was not surprised to learn, upon doing some research, that the author is an official in the Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church, the most fundamentalist and conservative part of the the Lutheran Church and perhaps one of the most conservative and fundamentalist churches in America. So be aware as you read: this novel is not as objective and as unbiased a ""documentary"" work as it might seem at first."
4,Excellent Historical Fiction of Ancient Rome,"Along w/ historical notes by a well-respected historian, Flames of Rome offers an interesting and attention-capturing account of Nero's persection of the Christians in 65 AD. Characters are well developed and believable. If you like historical fiction, that is heavy on the history and less on the fiction, this is the book for you."
5,A treasure from my childhood,"It's been years since I last read this book, but it still stands out as one of the very best I have ever read! I remember that it was assigned to me for school, and like any lazy student, groaned and put it off for as long as possible. But, when I finally started it, I couldn't put it down! I think I must have read it all in one night! And then my Mom bought it for me, since I loved it so much! Now, I have read it several times over. I think I will go dig it out. I can't wait to give my copy to my son and have him read it. I know I haven't said much about the story, but its been so long, I don't want to mix up any details. I highly recomend the Flames of Rome for anyone who likes a fast paced novel, while all the time learning the history of Rome and her rulers!"
3,A book with strong positives and negatives,"The strongest thing I can say about this book is that it was very eye-opening to me to dive deeper into the history of Rome. I think it was well researched and appreciated the author's commitment to do his best to stay true to history. The negative aspect of this book for me was the amount of text given to gratuitous sexual content. I don't doubt Rome was a city of excesses, especially when it came to sexuality. However, if I wanted to pick up a book to provide me with lots of mental imagery about orgies, drunken sexual encounters, homosexual interactions, bigamy, infidelity, etc., I am sure I could locate many. That wasn't my intent in reading this book. I truly believe the message the author intended to convey could have been received without a lot of what I would have preferred to skip."
5,Great Book,I appreciated this author's ability to blend historial fact with an entertaining plot line. I plan to check out his other books.
4,Wow what a way to live,"This is all I could say after reading this book. I found it highly entertaining and educational. I knew little about the city of Rome at this time. I am very interested in early christianity and while I realize it is tough with the available sources to provide much new information, this is interesting. I am awestruck by the personalities, particulalry Nero. What a self absorbed human being. I was shocked. I think this is a great book and in line with this Author's other books. I find this Author very enjoyable."
5,"Great Read, Captivating Story, Historically Enlightening","Paul Maier has written and excellent novel centering on one of the most intruiging time periods of the Roman Empire. While written with excellence in style, making it a captivating read, most impressive is Maier's writing philosophy. As a historian he has challenged himself to write the novel as closely as possible following the historical records left behind by the Roman historians themselves. The book is filled with footnotes in the back which confirm his sources, and note any places where he has taken artisitc liberties.It's both a facinating book to read and incredibly historically enlightening as well."
1,resistance band not included!,"Be warned: this product may not come with the resistance band. Because of this, I feel the price is not justified. Receiving a product like this is of course disappointing. I did leave feedback about the packaging with Amazon, but as of yet have had no reply. This leaves me with going to the trouble of returning it or buying bands separately. I have bought many many items from Amazon and this is only the second time I have had something that didn't work - or is missing a part, as in this case. Save yourself a hassle and buy a different product!"
1,"Boring, too short, not challenging",Can't say enough bad things about this dvd. I own tons of fitness videos and this is one of the worst I've used. It's short and not a challenge at all. SWAT is the wrong title for this dvd. No one who has any physical fitness background would use this
1,Gross,"I really looked forward to doing this workout, but when I started playing the dvd, I was laughing too much to be able to effectively do it. The instructor is a physically fit man who seems to know his stuff, but it's laughably distracting that he is surrounded by hard bodied women with large breast implants who wear extremely tight hot pants throughout the workout. If it weren't so ridiculous, I would be offended. Too bad that I can't return this. The Jillian Michaels workouts are much more worth the money."
3,Pleasantly pleased,"I work out consistently, usually rotating yoga, cardio, cycling, and weights. I purchased this DVD to switch up using weights with the band instead. The workout is pretty basic, in that you probably won't find it particularly challenging if you are maintain a high-intermediate to advanced level of fitness. However, the instructor makes this interesting, keeps it moving, and he's funny. I feel it burning, especially the ab portion of the workout, but I have to get different tubular bands. The workout itself is heavy on the arms and chest muscles and kind of glosses over the legs and no bun work out and I didn't find it aerobic in the least. If you want to mix up your routine, this offers an alternative worthy of including in the weekly or bi-weekly rotation."
1,What leather???,"This was a grave disappointment. It is being sent back now. It was listed as LEATHER BUT was NOT STAMPED LEATHER anywhere. Tag said ""leather AND ..."" I suppose the white body part MIGHT be the leather BUT it was apparent from the feel, the weight, and the smell of the open SMOOTH CUT edges of the black straps and the black bottom piece WERE NOT LEATHER. Too costly at $77 for plastic even with the nicely quilted red interior and cosmetic bag."
3,long winded,this book is helpful and draws the correct conclusions and spells out the issues..as adoptive parent I think that reading what another adoptive parent has written is very credible...they have been there....no one could understand the issues of adoptive parent of a teen or pre teen unless they have done it...it is so intense...the child will try to re enact lost stages of childhood and preschool years...and grow into a full fledged teen at the same time...you will live with preshooler and adult child all in the same day...but the hurt and anger comes from abandonment and mistreatment...and on this note the author got it 100% right....the book could have been shorter and more to the point...but underl;ying message is accurate.
1,An Ordeal,"I don't know what caused me to buy this book -- perhaps an Amazon recommendation. In any case, I differ from the more favourable reviewers. I just managed to get through it, and most of the way felt like a long hike, carrying a heavy pack, braving bad weather. Dreary, tedious, unrewarding, unedifying, dull, and unconvincing. As for those who wrote that Mr Hansen writes well, I will point out that the word madame, when used in English (which is rarely the case, and more or less unexplained here), does not normally take the definite article. ""The madame"" this, and ""The madame"" that. Oy. On top of all the awkwardness, the evocation of Edwardian London was totally unconvincing. And none of the characters was even remotely alive. If you value your money, don't spend it on this. If you value your time, don't waste it on this."
4,Perlman vs. The Chess Garden,"Several reviewers here have covered the fine points of ""Perlman's Ordeal"", so I will just weigh in on the ""it ain't ""The Chess Garden"" issue. It ain't. Like Pirsig's ""Zen and the Art..."", The Chess Garden invented a form which carried its message better than a traditional novel might have done. ""Perlman's Ordeal"" is not as inventive, but unlike Pirsig' ""Lila"", it is a first class novel anyway. I think I would have given it 5 stars if I hadn't had such high expectations of invention set by TCG. Now I'm ready for ""Boone"" to see what other pleasures Hansen has to offer."
4,More than worth your time,"At times, a fragile spiral of a shell, holding attention, but allowing a scrutable ""dissection."" I found myself both deeply involved and at a distance from the life of the doctor. Mr. Hansen's word choice is beautiful, and worth the read simply to roll them around the mind. His description of music by the doctor early in the book is as well-written a selection as I have ever come across. Hansen brings the story to an end both mysterious and predictable. His doctor leaves the story a different man, yet not too different. One can see that Mr. Hansen weaves his stories as a mental tapestry which he takes time to study and describe to us. The story is possibly not always as clear as we may wish, but reads as an oral tale, told with a cherishing tongue. Thanks, Brooks."
3,Mediocre Read,"Brooks Hansen's Perlmans Ordeal was extremely interesting in parts, funny and sweet in parts, but rather boring overall. Perlman's transformation seems forced, and the other characters seem very pretentious and unreal."
1,Our group did not like this book.,Our book club of 8 women reached a unanimous decision-for the first time- it was much ado about NOTHING! Eight thumbs down. The Park Slope Book Club
5,"Good price, works well","I installed this on my 2001 Isuzu Rodeo LS. Installation went relatively smoothly having consulted some helpful resources online (Isuzu Rodeo forums, etc.) that have info pertaining the procedure. The fact that the plug on this connector fits directly with the factory wiring harness plug on the vehicle was the main selling point for me, along with the price. It works well with the lighting system on my utility trailer."
4,Wiring setup for a utility trailer.,I received this item very quickly. It was very easy to install. It was just what was needed for someone who doesn't feel comfortable wiring electical items. I had it installed in 20 mins ( coulda done it way quicker a second time ). Highly recommend it.
4,Poorly reviewed by most.....,"... but I fond it quite creepy. I really can not say much about the film because to say almost anything would give the plot away and ruin the viewing experience. I will say that if you enjoy films about Time, is probable that you would enjoy this."
2,Not Thrilling nor horrific,"This wasn't thrilling or horrifically scary to me. The only thing scary about this movie was the darkness of the film, which was a bit irritating and may have added to my boredom. There were some parts of interest and surprises towards the end when the truth begins to take shape but for the most part it lost my attention midway and I found myself rewinding to re-view the parts that I hadn't paid attention to because I was bored."
2,Confused!,My friend recommend this movie as she really loves it and has watched it several time. Sorry friend I don't share your views. This movie was confusing and not very good. It ended up in the garage sale pile.
3,Could have been great but ...,"This movie could have been great but it just got too convoluted and the time line story just did not make logical sense. They tried to explain it but it just did not work. It was an ok movie to pass the time and all the actors tried real hard but it the end there are just too many better movies and so why waste your time. Had they stuck to one story line and not tried to time jump into other stories of child abuse and speaking to people that aren't really alive anymore the movie would have worked better. In the end, it is one of those movies that just ""coulda been a contender""."
2,Twisted Waste of Talent,"Malcolm McDowell and Madolyn Smith are good actors here wasted in a too-talky fencing match. At first the clever conversation draws you into questioning what is going on between these two, but then you realize that you cannot identify with either of them. Smith appears to be a suicidal psychotic, while McDowell is more robotic and unemotional. Neither react to each other in any way that seems normal. As it goes on getting more and more bizarre, you wish it would end soon so you can see the point, if there is one. Actually there isn't one. If you like existential plays that remind you of what Hell is really like, you may like this bit of trash. It reminds me of the depressing play No Exit -- a real downer. Don't see this movie if you are already taking Prozac or any other antidepressants."
3,two different movies,"The reviews here cover both movies:The Caller (1987) with Malcolm McDowell and Madolyn Smith; and The Caller (2011). Very different from each other.Amazon has mixed them together, the same reviews appear at both Amazon pages. There doesn't seem to be any way to contact them to correct this.I just watched the 1987 movie and it was OK. Too much talk that wasn't clarified at the end. Surprise ending out of the blue only leads to more confusion. Poorly written but well acted."
2,JUST HANG UP,"THE CALLER is one of those films wherein we the viewer is left to make their own conclusions on what we just watched. Frankly, I've grown weary of this trend. I watch movies mainly to be entertained, not to play cinema ivestigator. Give me the clues, involve me in the mystery, but don't expect me to finish the writer's job.THE CALLER posits time distortion at one point and then suggests a haunted phone, child abuse, ghosts, attempted murder, bodies behind walls. Not to mention the time shifts that never make sense. That's the movie's downfall--it doesn't make sense. Add the hideous lighting and lack of sustainable tension, you get one frustrating film!Rachelle Lefevre (TWILIGHT), Stephen Moyer (TRUE BLOOD), Ed Quinn (BEHEMOTH) and Lorna Raver (DRAG ME TO HELL) all try hard, but can't overcome the disjointed screenplay.THE CALLER is just an enigmatic misfire."
1,Rife with errors and inconsistencies,"Have the Syngress proofreaders fallen asleep on the job?This book is so full of errors and inaccuracies that it becomes painful to read after a while. Especially the annotated examples, where the line numbers for the code listings often bear no relation to the line numbers listed in the accompanying analysis.Makes you wonder... what else have they got wrong?This is 2 books from Syngress I've got that are very poor quality. What's going on guys?I recommend you wait for the 2nd edition."
1,What a disappointment!,"James Prosek is as brilliant an artist as he is a poor writer. His style is regrettably imitative, paying obvious homage to both Thomas McGuane and Ernest Hemingway without measuring up as even a respectable forgery. I really anticipated a flyfishing book; not a boastful manuscript of sexual conquests. The fishing community wants John Gierach, not Danielle Steel. If you want to buy something by Mr. Prosek, make it the watercolor books of artistry and history. They are top notch."
1,Drinking or fishing?,"I have enjoyed reading other books by Mr. Prosek, however, this one was a true disappointment.I couldn't figure out if this was a book about fishing or drinking. There seemed to be more anecdotes regarding drinking and getting soused than any fishing action. Even if the author loves to drink, the book is supposed to be about fishing the 41st parallel and all that that should entail.I may not have learned much about trout fishing, but I sure know where to find booze joints along the 41st parallel."
5,"1"" woodowl auger bit","I bought this bit to use for making rustic furniture. I am very pleased with it. It cuts a very clean hole that makes a perfect mortise. It does require a powerful drill because it is quite aggressive when cutting. I am very satisfied, and will buy several more sizes in the near future."
2,"Uncomfortable, poor sound","I bought this headset with the hopes of using it to Skype with my friend in Spain, but found the sound quality so poor and the headset so uncomfortable that I really haven't used it at all."
3,"nicely built, but needs pressure.","This is a handsome showerhead, built like an army tank. But, you really need a lot of water pressure to make it work correctly. If you have high water pressure, this fixture should last a long time."
5,WOW!,"I have read many wonderful books over the past years, but this is the first time that I have been motivated to actually send in a review. I heartily recommend this book. I won't go into specifics, but just want to say, get it, read it, mark it up, reread it, then live it out. Thank you, Cynthia."
5,Extreme insight,"The first book read by this author, I recommend her writing and this one in particular, for a clear and contemporary look at the issues of both spirituality and the discipline of prayer and meditation. A tough area to undertake in ""description,"" the writing is powerful in both simplicity and impact.I recommend it highly as inspirational and effective writing."
4,"Good, but Outdated.","This book uses PostgreSQL 8.0 (or 8.1, maybe?), which is pretty outdated. Version 9.2 is out and has a lot of great features. I don't hold that against the book, but if you plan on learning and using the latest features of PostgreSQL, you may want to wait until a more recent book comes out. The official PostgreSQL site has great documentation that also includes a tutorial section (www_postgresql_org), so maybe you should look there first until the author update this text."
2,"the reverse of Big, sort of","This is a very unusual movie. It is not a comedy, It is not a drama, it is not a fantasy. It is sort of all of them rolled into one. At times you think it's some kind of documentary spoof, but not all the time. Though it is not a great movie and kind of drags, it has a good story to it and has some really good acting. The best scenes in the movies are the interview by the teacher and father are the most powerful. Silverman and Sorvino fans might want to catch this film but it is deffinately not for everyone"
5,"Plenty of Room, Plenty of Rice","I bought a few of these to use as food service items for my summer camp. I have no complaints; it is rugged, works well and is a reliable rice cooker. I have had this model for three years now, and have no need to replace it or purchase an alternative. This was a good choice; I plan to purchase additional cookers in the future."
5,inside info of book,"Welcome to Volume 1 in a series of old fashioned cottage life, where oil lamps were lit and water was drawn from a well. The work was laboriously hard, but people still had leisurely hours to stop, sit and ponder, read or gossip. I do hope you enjoy painting these, at a leisurely pace, losing yourself in the moment."
5,great book!,absolutly the best book I have ever read about this subject really full of useful thing.Thanks Dott. Garcia
1,Atrix 4G BoxWave Case,"This product does NOT fit an Atrix HD - even though it is a 4G phone. This would have been helpful to know ahead of time before my purchase was complete. Unfortunately, you will have to pay to ship it back for their lack of accuracy in their description - someone needs to fix this. Truly a shame because the product seemed decent."
1,Save your money,"I bought this as a gift for my kid. About the time he got used to it, the darned thing quit working. Short battery life - shortest camera life of any of the half dozen digitals I've purchased."
2,what you see is what you get.,"Although it performs OK in good light, the flash leaves something to be desired and the image quality was poor. The camera also uses batteries up very quickly, and mine stopped working after six months. the camera is very light, small and cheap looking because that is exactly what it is."
1,Not Impressed,Very poor image quality. Indoor pictures were terrible.<br />My 3 Mega-pixel Kodak takes much clearer pictures.
5,care of soul is core,"I couldn't put this book down, though I could only read it in small chunks to savour the treasure of it's content. Digestion continues long after the soul full meal! I found it helpful to have a working knowledge of psychological concepts to better grasp it's meanings at times. By the nature of soul, the book is spiritual but not prescriptive. For me, this is a beautiful book which I was sad to finish. This book helped me further dig down to become more aware of what helps me care for myself or my soul, in fulfilling ways,and to explore what helps me live a meaningful life. I have underlined significant portions of my copy which I know I will refer to time and time again."
2,Unclear,I had trouble connecting with what the author was trying to say. I just kept feeling like I wasn't getting. Frustrating.
3,unhappy,i would of like to of bought the game suikoden 2 but they reallt dont say 1 way or anther im still trying to get the game
2,Interesting,It was okay. Just wasn't interesting to the child it was bought for. A little to talkitive for him to enjoy
1,"Looses signal, inacurate and leaked","I had this product for one bike ride, in fact half of a ride, because after an hour the monitor stopped working. (As I discovered later somehow the chest strap battery compartment was partially open and sweat leaked inside damaging the battery.) I had to return the unit, and opted out against a replacement.For the first hour non the less I had trouble with the monitor:- The heart rate was jumping all over the scale (from 60 to 200)- The wrist unit was increasingly loosing chest strap signal (possibly as battery was becoming more sweat damaged).- The Tap-On Lens, after extensive set up activation, never workedOn the good sides of the device:- Low price- Rich features (low/high HR limits alarm, fitness level presets, etc.)- Removable bands on the chest strap so you could wash those"
1,Less than expected!,I received my heart rate monitor and it was horrible. I found it very difficult to set up andI still can't reset the stop watch. If I hadn't already thrown the package away (my bad) I would have returned it.I have owned several heart rate monitors and this is a piece of junk (being polite)!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great price for a 2-in-1.,"Overall I'm very happy with the product. The HRM does a good job and is easy to use. The watch is lacking a 'seconds' field, which I like to use for manually checking my resting heart rate when I wake in the morning. It's a bit annoying to have to switch modes and start the chrono for this. The Tap On Lense feature is neat, but more of a novelty. I disabled it.Bottom line - it does everything it claims to quite well. And for a little more than the price of a Timex Iron Man, you get the HRM built-in. Great deal."
2,Not Great,"I've had the monitor for about a week and I regret getting it. I only just started endurance running so I didn't bother buying one of those expensive HRM's. But after buying the Oregon Scientific my suggestion is if your going to get a HRM, just go for a good one. The strap doesn't pick up my heart rate easily and when it does the reading is either too high or too low to be accurate. I have to adjust the strap every time it loses the signal which is a real pain when I'm trying to run. Sometimes the readings jump around from high to low heart rate, so I know it's wrong. Also, the watch is really uncomfortable - it presses against my wrist bone when. During a run I sometimes don't even bother dealing with it and just end up using the timer. Every once in a while I get a good reading while I'm running but I'll be lucky if it stays. However this is what I expected for the price."
5,The data recorder was great and inexpensive addin--Even better it was not subject to electrical interference,"Great unit but it tends to suddenly register stray electrical signals from power lines, strong motors etc. The recorder seemed immune to these"
1,Horrible product that didn't work as described,"I wanted this to be my entry into heart rate monitors. Well, it did that, because it taught me not to be a cheapskate.The touch feature didn't work at all. Setup was difficult and time consuming. The heart rate monitor was passable, but the calories burned feature was terrible (4 calories burned during a 60 minute spin class?). I returned it for a refund."
3,It kinda works,"i have owned this product since april and it is now almost december. this seems like a very decent product with minor quality problems which can be quite frustrating. the tap on lens feature has never worked, not one time, even when new. this is a very minor problem because it is a feature i would not probably use anyway. the second problem is the buttons are quite unresponsive on the watch part which can be quite frustrating. i have had no desire to smash the product due to frustration but have come close, which makes my heart rate go up, during which you can tell the monitor is quite accurate. despite the quality problems i feel like i got a good deal, paid $25 at gander mtn."
4,"Fine for a man, not so much for a woman","My wife and I both walk/jog/run on the treadmill every day, and we wanted a more accurate monitor than the built-in one offered. With the sensors positioned correctly, and with good body contact, this works very well, although occasionally and momentarily, readings fluctuate wildly.The instruction manual shows how and where to place the chest strap--obviously, for a man, and almost impossible for a woman. So she's found a way to position the sensor unit in her bra to ensure pretty reliable sensor contacts. Still, though, readings can fluctuate on occasion.In summary, it gives an accurate reading of pulse rate most of the time, and seems well constructed. 4 stars, if you're male; 3 stars, if you're female. We appreciate that the battery for the chest strap is replaceable, and is the same type as used in the watch unit."
1,Crapola,"Don't But This, It's Awful.I got this because I love a bargain. It was a waste of my hard earned money. The problems are 1) it doesn't register heart rate well (big problem for a HRM) I'm in great shape--but sometimes when I'm working out hard it says my HR is 40. Trust me, it's way more than that, 2) Sometimes it refuses to shift functions. I hit the button umpteen times to get it to move from one palce to another. #3 could be my problem but either it doesn't have a calorie burned counter or I can't find it. Maybe that's me and I'm more concerned about getting my HR, but that would be nice to have.Steve Mac"
3,good for heart rate but horrible to count calories.,I'm not sure if I set the watch the right way I think so but for some reason the calories are way off. The heart rate it's similar to the machines at the gym.
5,Tears of the Moon,Great book about Australia in the northwest region and the pearling industry. Good character development and lots of historical facts.
4,Tears of the Moon,Well written and a strong story line. I liked the way the author kept the story flowing and how the story kept me glued to the pages.
5,A good read,Gives a great history of the pearling industry up north. Makes you feel like taking a trip to see it all
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This book was very entertaining and powerful in its depth. The characters came alive and I felt as if I was a trusted friend, living in the town and listening to them tell me about their day to day activities. I'd really like to read Ms. Morrissey's other books!"
4,Another Great Book By the Queen of Aussie Literature,"I found this to be another wonderful offering from the queen of Australian literature.Wonderfully interesting characters and a great plot line. I found the switching between past and present great and not at all confusing. I loved this novel as I have loved every other book by Ms Morrissey and I own them all. I hope that everyone else finds this novel as interesting, absorbing, and impossible to put down as I did.I find that it is a wonderful view of life in the early years of Australia. Everyone should read this novel."
5,Really enjoyed it,"This was the first Di Morrisey book I have read, and I really enjoyed it. I read it because I am a new resident to Broome where the story is set. Although it is fiction, it gave me a great understanding of what the pearling industry must have been like in the early days, and really sparked an interest in the history of the town. Amongst all of this - a great story that I thoroughly enjoyed. The only disappointing thing was the multitude of spelling and grammatical errors that have obviously occurred when converting this book into digital format. Please fix these!! Will definately read more of her books."
3,Insightful Analysis,"Todd Vogel does a fine job of putting together some well written essays that promote the culture of the Black Press. But, while the book is complete in its analysis of the historical run of Black literary mediums, the book fails to contrast the significant historical steps taken in mainstream news outlets. Many of the essays routinely focus on the approach and impact the Black Press had (and still has) but unfortunately didn't do a sufficient job of comparing other mediums. This book would work well in a journalism diversity or history class. But it would be up to the readers to analytically compare the mainstream media."

4,Great,I was pretty new to the Transformers universe and am so glad I purchased this book. I learned everything there is to know about the franchise up until Armada. Recommended.
4,great for new-ish fans,"If you don't know anything about transformers, or you know a little and want to know more, then this is a good buy for you. It's packed with lots of information and detailed illustrations, which means it's not a labor to read it, but it's also not a picture-book. If you are a real transformers aficionado, then you're probably not going to learn anything from this. However, that doesn't mean it won't be a good thing to have around just for reference/entertainment.Overall, a good purchase.PS--The pages, printing, binding, and hard cover are all extremely good quality, a lot of care was put into the production of this volume."
4,Absolute Must...but text for older kids.,"This is definitely the best Transformers book out there...and I spent a long time looking. My five year old son loves it. We have looked at it every night for about a year now. It's also fun for Dad, since it reviews the whole history of Transformers and the toys back to my day.Beware, the text in the book is quite advanced for a child under say 9. But the pictures all over each page are entertainment enough."
4,Transformers: The Ultimate Guide,"i give this book ""Transformers: The Ultimate Guide"" 4 out of 5 as it was one of the best Transformer books i've ever read. i could of contained a little more info on genation one though."
1,One man's opinions and nothing more.,"I have read this guide and I am thankful that I did not buy it. Why? Because the author screwed up. Simon Furman used this book as an opportunity to pass off his own opinions and interpretations as Transformer canon, and I will never forgive him for that. He even allows his own prejudices about the G1 cartoon vs. comic debate to seep through, saying that the Cartoon continuity has a few inconsistencies but not leveling the same (equally valid) complaint against the comics. He presents comic-only elements of the mythos (such as the Primus creation story) as fact and ignores anything from the cartoon series (such as the Quintesson creation story) that doesn't fit into that.A guide of this type must be as objective as possible. Simon Furman crapped all over that principle. Bad guide, period."
4,good,"I love transformers and this book bigng me good memories, is a good book.You have to buy is good and cheap."
2,Disapointing,"For an 'Ultimate Guide' its more on flashy pictures then tons of information. I had hope for a detail insight into the different series of Transformers, I was deeply disappointed. What informations it gives on characters and places is very limited and not at all in depth."
2,Ultimate guide?,"This book comes with some good artwork and nice facts, but it is nowhere near what could be called an ultimate guide, it's more like a quick factbook. It spans very little of the toylines, and each series, in very few pages. I wouldn't recomend it for the fans to the extrreme fans unless you just want a nice small book with good artwork in it.Increase this book size by about 2000 pages and put a gigantic ammount of information in it, then maybe it would be a nice thing to buy, but comon a paragraph at most for each transformer other then the leaders, Unicron or Primus.Again in a nutshell this is not a book for any fan or diehard fan, it's more of a begginers book for children who have recently gotten into the Transformers via the series or the recent movie."
5,Ferri's guide to indexing really helpful,"I have taken advantage of the latest market volatility to confirm my long-term financial strategy. I ordered several books from Amazon on asset allocation and using low-cost index funds or ETFs for investment.Rick Ferri's books (I also ordered his new ETF book) are well-researched, complete guides to sensible, long-term investing. He avoids the fads, and provides information in clear, understandable terms without all of the emotional ""hype"" present in many books about the capital markets.In my opinion, Mr. Ferri's prior books (and the articles he has published in journals for financial professionals) have made me a better investor.I highly recommend All About Index Funds."
5,Noob,I'm a total noob to the market and investing but this book explained so much. I think its a must read for anyone looking into investing for their future and have no idea where to start.
5,The New Standard for On-Line Team Games,"Incredible eye-candy graphics, realistic stereo sound, well balanced weapons, no silly running and jumping abilities and real damage when you are hit.But the real gem here is the team play. You NEED to have a team balanced with soldiers, medics, engineers and lieutenants. Because of their unique abilities (and limitations), it requires you to help each other (unlike the independent-semi-team play of Quake III).This is a must have just for the online gaming (although the single player does look like it has a promising story and missions)....."
3,Entertaining but lacking,"This is a decent game, it's fun, you can kill american pigdogs, it's got it all. The only problem is, Day of Defeat...the halflife mod is much more fun, much more developed, it's not at pretty since it's using the ~4 year old halflife engine, but that, in my opinion just proves how versatile and modifiable valve's engine was. DoD has better maps than what I've seen from this game thus far. This is an ok game, but honestly, it looks like DoD done with a budget and bad mappers, I'm still going to buy/play this game, but I'll also continue to play DoD. That's all I have to say"
1,Poor compatability,"I have three reasonably new computers in my home - all AMD 1400's and a PIII 1,000. Lots of memory and high end video cards (ATI and Matrox). The game won't run on any machine. Same error message, and NO support from ID Software.This was a big waste of money and a disappointment. Don't buy it unless you feel really lucky, and have some money to waste."
3,"Nice soundtrack, but.....","If you liked the music in the anime, you'll mostly like the soundtrack disc (which comes with some versions of the anime on DVD). The biggest downside of this soundtrack disc is that 4 of the tracks (1, 9, 10, 11) are all playing variations of the same song: Through the Years and Far Away. It's a great song but given that the soundtrack is only 27:40 minutes in length, having 11 minutes of that taken up by variations of the same song lessens the appeal of the disc. You're better off just getting the soundtrack for free along with the DVD for the anime."
5,Great stuff!!,"I bought this because it was recommended by another dog breeder as a good fly repellent. It works! Really works! We have the worst deer flies and they chew up dog ears like raw meat. A quick spray of this each morning, and the flies leave the dogs alone. And it smells nice and leaves the coat looking healthy and shiney. Love it!"
2,Cowboy burgers suck,"The only reciepe I've made from this book was the Cowboy turkey burgers. It was awful, it ended up being a stir fry and I just ate the ""burgers"" with a fork. Gross. Since I'm a novice cook, I wasn't able to adjust the reciepe in time to save the meal.One saving grace is the fact it's organized by ""time"" rather than indexed. Terrible for people looking for something specific, but for us ""browsers"" this is a fun way of searching. I also took the liberty of pairing each menu title with an appropriate movie. For instance the ""Monster Munchies"" menu I paired with the movie ""Godzilla"". That was the funnest part, matching her menu titles to movies I would love to share with friends. Like the show ""Dinner & a Movie"". In this way, you can make it even MORE fun when you are browsing for the perfect reciepe to share with friends."
4,"Good recipes, and you don't have to listen to her talk!","I'm not a huge fan of her show, but I like her creative takes on flavors. I've made several of these recipes, and everyone has loved them. Nice variety of recipes in this book, too."
3,Just ok...,"I bought this book used at a local bookstore and was extremely excited to try it out. I am a fan of the show on Food Network as well as Rachel's new talk show. I was a little dissappointed though because I didn't have most of the ingredients required to make any of the recipes. A lot of the ingredients (I think) most busy people would not have in their pantries. I guess I expected simpler meals where I didn't have to buy fancy and expensive ingredients that I may not ever use again. I will admit, you can get some excellent ideas from the book."
1,This book doesn't make me want to cook at all!!,"I hate this cookbook. I have tried for days to get over the way it was organized by meals instead of type of meal. Also there is no index to quickly find a meal. I cannot get over the organization of this book to cook with it. Thought I would try her book since her show interested me, but it's a waste of money for me."
4,Very Tasty!,Rachael Ray isnt very attractive but she IS a good cook! Her Mince Pie recipe was shockingly good when combined with 7 oz's of nutmeg and 2 bowls of brown sugar! A minced Pie wouldn't be a minced pie without Rachael Ray Ray!
1,gross!,"this food looked like someone threw it up! i wouldn't even serve it to my dog, so i wrapped it up in tin foil and gave it to the neighbors. i only suggest this book for all of us who occassionally have unwanted house guests. believe me, they won't stay long."
3,Organization holds it back,"I would have given this book a slightly higher rating were it not for the incovenient organization. It's organized by time of day, not course or ingredient. I can't seem to anticipate what time of day the kind of food I want would be in. For that reason, I don't tend to pick it up when I'm looking for a recipe quickly.The handful of recipes I have tried, though, were excellent. If you're not a Rachel Ray fan, these recipes won't impress you since they are similar in tone to her others. I personally like her and will probably eventually make my way through many of the recipes in this book."
4,"Yeah, Rach, where's the index?","I too am an avid fan of Rachael Ray and her shows. However this volume was 1/8 tsp. disappointing because the book is poorly organized, and it pains me to say that. Every cookbook should have an index (this one does not), and while it's a neat gimmick to organize the recipes by time of day, one person's 7:00PM is another's 7:00AM. I also miss not having the all of the recipes organized into meals- which is the one the gimmick she should stick with. On a positive note, however, the recipes themselves are fabulous and true RR fans should not pass this one by. If you are new to Rachael, I would personally recommend 30 Minute Meals 2 or Get Togethers."
4,Wonderful Collection,The recipes are fabulous and easy to follow. I have been pleased with every recipe I have tried. Rachael Ray can take the most difficult recipe and simplify it to the point that anyone can do it. A wonderful recipe collection and a very nice gift.
3,What is the aversion to an index?!,"This is another great collection of recipes from her TV shows, but it is also another cookbook without an index!? What is the problem here? If, for example, you want to find recipes featuring chicken, you have to look through the ofttimes too cute and too quippy table of contents in the front that features recipes organized by show title or theme. Very very annoying. I'll think twice before buying another of her books despite loving what she does and how she does it."
3,No index!,Good recipes but EXTREMELY frustrating with no index. Too many cutsy names requiring reading the entire table of contents to find a dinner idea.
4,Cooking 'Round the Clock: Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Meals,"This is the type of cookbook that allows you to have fast, mostly fresh, meals on the table in mostly 30 minutes. Some of the prep work seems to take longer in my household for whatever reason. The only word of CAUTION is how many people she thinks the recipe will serve. The woman must have the metabolism of a hummingbird because if I ate the amount suggested by one of her ""serves 4"" recipes I'd have to become an ultramarathoner just to keep my present weight. (We are not light eaters in the family either.) I made the mistake of increasing a ""serves 4"" soup recipe by 1/2 to serve 6 and had to change out to a large dutch oven mid-way through cooking. I also had enough leftover soup to have another whole meal. With the exception of the pizza recipes, the serving sizes indicated can be adjusted UPWARDS by 1/2."
2,hard to use,"The recipes are fine, but the book does not contain an index or a table of contents. Recipes are organized by time of day you might want to make them. If you read cookbooks cover to cover then you'll be ok. The only way to find a recipe is to flip through every page in the book."
2,Not for me,"I had a hard time getting started, and then I got to a part where I thought something might really happen. It didn't. The scene at Zara's house went on forever and just kept rehashing the same thing. The plot had the potential to go somewhere, but it never really develped like it could have. I was glad when I finished it."
3,"I'm giving this book a 3 star, since it was, after all FREE!","Ya gotta love FREE! The book was only okay, kind of in the 2-3 star range. The story was set in pre-revolution Russia, it was about spies sort of, and wasn't very believable. But again, it was free, and it was my in-flight entertainment recently. But I doubt I'll read it again."
5,Excellent,This book was very informative and covers most everything you want to know about ferrets. It was a good book for the price I paid and easy to read and understand. Book was also in very good shape.
4,Excellent Book,"This book provides the reader a great overview of ferret care, health, diet, and many other topics such as the food they eat and the type of cages they should have. The only thing I did not like about the book is on page 31 quoting, ""If your ferret plays too roughlt, a sound thump on the nose with your forefinger, accompanied by a sharp ""No"", will soon advise your ferret that this is not acceptable behavior"". I have to disagree! Out of all ferret reading I have done, books, magazines, and Internet researching, I always read that nose thumping is not appropriate to teach a ferret of his/her errors. This is only book that suggests that it is okay. Otherwise all the other topics are great and make sense. Despite the disagreement, I give 4 stars for great overall well rounded book."
5,GREAT TO READ IF YOU ARE A FAN OF RAMONES,this is about the bassist of the legendary punk group: the ramones. They curse a lot in this book just in case a little kid wants to read it. you will learn about him getting ticked with his bandmates and how he is obessed with dope.BEWARE:this would only interest a fangabba gabba hey
4,Wild ride...,"Donna Wildman is trained in profiling criminals and works with the police in the Los Angeles County. She is called to investigate the murder of a teenage runaway, and soon realises that there's a serial killer on the loose who is targeting prostitutes. Donna is surprised when she finds clues which lead back to the police department. Is the killer a cop? Is it someone she's working with, who is aware of how close she's getting to the truth?This book has got lots of suspense which will keep you anxiously flipping the pages until you've read it all. The identity of the killer will keep you guessing, and the pace will keep you breathless!"
1,Horrible,"Nothing like any of his other books, and a tremendous dissapointment. The plot was choppy and hard to follow, and I became bored with it from about page 15 on."
5,Hot & steamy!,"This is a unique, well written book that catapults you along with the heroine into Roman times. This is a steamy romance novel that will keep you in its embrace until the last page is turned. Then it leaves you aching for more. I have read many of Virginia Henley's novels and this is, by far, my favorite."
2,"""Historical"" really isn't correct here....","The author didn't do her homework for either the hero's or the heroine's time period, so if you're an astute fan of historicals, you'll want to skip this. There are numerous mistakes from fashion to etiquette. If you like raw, steamy, unbridled lust, read on. Can't really recommend this one because I prefer a bit more substance."
2,Don't do it!,"Truly awful! Melodramatic, contrived situations and dialogue and an annoying heroine. The weak attempt at plot seemed merely an excuse to string together a bunch of sex scenes."
1,Meeting mr. Abusive,Proper and prim english lady fantasizes about meeting a 'real man' finds herself falling back in time to Roman Britain where she is quickly taken by a Roman officer who enslaves her mistreates her forces her to wear scant cloths but eventually falls in love with her but she gets burned at the stake by a jealous Nero.Difficult to understand to say the least.
3,"If you must read Virginia Henley, this is the best one","Virginia Henley's novels are, like most in the romance genre, highly predictable--outspoken, beautiful heroines a little too modern for their surroundings, handsome, dark-haired alpha males who are unbelievably stubborn and narrow minded, and miscommunication as plot advancement--and let's not forget the sex scenes! However, ""Enslaved"" is just a cut above Ms. Henley's usual historical erotica, because she tones down everything just a bit. The scenes in Roman-controlled Britain are surprisingly well-written, and her hero, Marcus, is acually--gasp!--a sympathetic character. Diana is a typical Henley heroine (we know she has violet eyes, Virginia, you don't have to keep telling us), but again, a little toned down so as to be sympathetic as well. In short, a good story, a decent plot, an inventive setting. If you're an occasional romance reader, this is a good one with which to while away a rainy weekend."
1,This is the worst book I've read in a long time,"I bought this on a whim, partly inspired by the high rating given to it by other readers, but I was so disappointed in it. Granted, one doesn't expect a romance novel to be ""War and Peace"", but even for the genre, this was just so bad. The author has absolutely no sense of the manners and customs of the time....the characters seem to have stepped right out of a suburban mall. The plot is flat, the characters are so stock (he's gorgeous, she's gorgeous), and the heroine has all the character and will-power of wet kleenex. The book only seems to be written so that the author can string together a bunch of sex scenes, which are meant to be exciting to the reader, I guess. Again, granted it's a romance novel, but I still expect a story along with the requisite sex bits. Well, I just expected better. The time-travel romance ""Dragonfly in Amber"" is light-years ahead of this book in terms of intelligence."
3,Just OK...,"This book was so high rated on Amazon I had to read it myself. The story had some very high moments, but some not so great ones as well. I wasn't happy with the way the romance played out, it was very unsatisfying to me. Also, there were too many sex scenes in the book. Yea, one when the characters get together is very satisfying, but the book verged on soft core porn. I also wasn't thrilled by some of the things our Hero did, though he seemed to redeem himself... at times. Allin allthe story was great, but I wasn't thrilled with the results. I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from reading this book, there were moments that were great, it just wasn't my cup of tea."
5,Enslaved,"I am new to romance novels however, those that I had read had left me wanting. Until I was introduced to Virginia Henley. I have thoroughly enjoyed all her books, but ""Enslaved"" is one of her best. Ms.Henley makes you feel as if you are truly in Aquae Sulis and Rome. The warmth, love and pain of the main characters is heart wrenching. I could not put this book down. An excellent read."
5,A Definate Keeper!,"I have been reading romance books for years, but this is the first one I read that plays during the Roman Times and it was interesting to learn about this era. Ms. Henley definately did her research, her portrayal of this time history was facinating, not tedious and boring like other novels. This book was very sensual, mature, witty and the overall theme of time travel and reincarnation seemed very credible. I loved it! It was so heartfelt! Diana and Marcus's love transports through time."
1,Beware of Warranty,"My crown popped off in the first year and Tag is charging me a $200 service fee for fixing it. They do not stand behind their warranty and after dealing with customer service, I will never buy anotehr one. This is my third Tag and my LAST!"
2,Beware of this watch,Great looking watch. Has Tag name and cache but it is defective. The crown popped off three times in the last year. The first time only 4 months after I purchased it. Been repaired under warranty but only as a courtesy as only the movement is covered by this non-authorized warranty. Be very careful purchasing this watch from a non-authorized seller as you do not get the Tag warranty.
5,TAG Heuer Carrera Chronograph Tachymetre,The wife purchased this watch for me as a birthday gift. It's been about 9 months now and the watch has been great. The fit and finish are excellent and it keeps fairly accurate time. I did swap out the SS bracelet with the TAG perforated leather strap. Both options are great but I find the leather strap goes better with suits (I use this watch mainly with business/business casual attire).
1,NOT FOR NEW IPOD VIDEO (CLASSIC),"This is not for the New Ipod Video. You need APPLE's Composite Cable set. It comes with a power adapter for $49.99. You can not use cheaper Composite Cables by others on new iPod Videos (CLASSIC). APPLE has a chip in theirs. ONLY THEIRS WORKS! DO NOT get the COMPONENT CABLES if you do not have a HD-TV. Not such a good signal, if it works. APPLE'S COMPOSITE CABLE SET is the safest option. You DO NOT NEED THE DOCK! That Set cost $100.00 and dock isn't needed. An Apple Sales person will try and sell you the DOCK!"
2,Rushed,"I've had this book for a while and just picked it up recently while between books. I found that the storyline was rushed along (quite remarkable for the size of the book). They were in love just like that with no buildup and such. I'm still reading but it's just to get to the end, rather than for rapt attention//entertainment."
3,A Family Raised on Rainbows Book,The author of the book was from Cincinnati and I loved her books. I lost this book and I found it on Amazon and was so happy I could order it.
1,Nice idea but does not work,"This sounded great and had good reviews so I got one for me and one for my wife. We both have trouble with our iPods not charging sometimes when we use the wall adapters. Sometimes they charge, sometimes they don't. I also have trouble sometimes with my cell phone not charging when I plug it in. Sometimes it charges and sometimes it doesn't. The car adapters do not work at all with either iPod or with either cell phone. The whole point of having a charger is to charge your battery. When you plug in your cell phone before bedtime expecting to have a full charge when you get up, it's very frustrating to have a dead battery instead."
2,NIce concept but sub-par reliability,"I bought this from Amazon.The concept for this is a sound one. Unfortunately the product is not very reliable. The tips seem to outlast everything else. The fittings to all the other components are proprietary and they come apart.Again, I really like the concept but it is poorly executed. I recommend finding an alternative solution.loudcloud.us is where we list solutions that we have found to work well for us."
2,good idea but always fails in a year,"my wife and i have both had IGO equipment and although the idea is good, the parts are kind of pricey and the power units failed (died) in 1 year or less for both of us. still, i like the concept."
3,kindle accessory,"It appeared to be a good product; however, it did not fit the connections for my kindle. I was disappointed because it was advertised as a accessory for the kindle, but it was not."
1,KINDLE 2 DOES NOT WORK,GOT KINDLE 2 AND WANTED TO CHARGE IT ANYWHERE. WAS LISTEDON KINDLE 2 AS ALSO TO BUY AND PAYED HIGH PRICE FOR ITAND CAN'T USE IT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT COME WITH ANY TIPS.TIPS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. SO I USE IT AS PAPER WEIGHT. DO NOTBUY THIS ITEM UNLESS YOU WANT TO DOUBLE THE COST OF WHATYOU PAY FOR THE PACKAGE BECAUSE UNLESS YOU ADD THE COST OFTIPS TO GO WITH ORIGINAL WIRE COST BECAUSE THAT IS ALL YOUGET WITH FIRST PURCHASE.
1,DISGUISED RIPOFF,"This product is worthless unless you buy the connection tip (sold separtly) When you get the product, you can then figure out which tips you need,order them, then pay $[...] plus shipping and wait a month to use this product.[...]"
1,I-Go charger,"I think it was very silly that this product was recommended to be purchased along with the Kindle, but it does not have the proper linkage (tip?) that matches! So, there it is, in the box along with the kindle, and totally useless."
4,AC/DC Charger together,"Although the plastic looks and feels like very cheap plastic and as if were to fall it'd come apart easily (mine has yet to fall), this is a nice idea of having a AC (home) and DC (on the road) charger for your Kindle or such.Keep in mind though you NEED a tip that's appropriate for your device. Be it the A00 tip for your Kindle or whatever. Having this alone will not do anything for you.It comes with a nice black bag to keep both chargers and the wire spool inside of along with the tip."
2,Disappointed,"The product is not as versatile as indicated. Since it was on the page with the Kindle, I thought it was used for it overseas but it isn't. It also doesn't work on my Blackberry."
1,Kindle buyers beware,"I bought this for my Kindle, notice it is listed as a kindle accessory, it arrived quickly, but is unusable without a ""tip"" sold separately...duhh like where and how? there is no way to plug it into the kindle. Totally useless. A note in the description with a reference to the correct tip would have been nice."
1,Something of a rip-off,The product itself seems to be ok. The problem is Amazon allowed them to offer it under Kindle accessories when in fact it does not come with an adapter that will attach it to the Kindle. The adapter costs another $9 for a small tip to connect it. Buy one of the other chargers that will actually connect to the Kindle.
2,"""Needs attachments to work""",I thought I needed this for my Kindle to work. I didn't. Then I found out it needs attachments. If I can find another use for it I may keep it.
1,kINDLE ACESSORIES,"I bought this retractable charger cord to use with my Kindle, since it was one of the suggested acessories.It however will not plug into my kindle, and is therfore of no use to me."
2,he talks therefore he is,"a lot of chumming by Paul Joyce, pandering to Mr. Hockney who holds forth with nothing to give him pause.I admire mr. hockneys paintings but I think he should have heeded one of his heroes, Picasso, and say little. Let his work speak for itself.I am sorry I read it because now I will remember blah-blah-blah whenever I see one of his paintings. Regrettable."
4,one of my best books,"I was 14 when I bought this origami book and Iwas simply astonished with the variety and the complexity of the animals(well some of them)but now iIam much more experient than other days and noticed that this is only an ""average""complex book.there are some jewels on this book and also some weird modelsthe elephant is my all-time favorite model,and the insects(except the bbeetle)are amazingbut geting back to the bad parts .. the pegasus looks like a winged dog,I think the rhino's head is very strange,the whale is very stylized and it's impressive how every toucan that john montroll designs don't look like a real onebut afterall this is a cool book if you are tired of those simple models they teach on TV"
5,Worth every penny,"This book was very inspirational for me when I first read it (back in the 80's). I still have some of the models memorized. Some of the models are fairly complex, but not as difficult as some other books, and the diagrams are clear."
3,ok,this item came in an ok time but i was exspecting the handle to come with it and it didnt so its hard to clean the pool with out any handles
2,no manual,I just received my kit today and have to say I am a bit surprised to find it not containing a manual on how to use the vacuum head. It doesn't come with anything to connect it to anything either. And it lacks a description how to use it at all. I have no idea how and where to hook it up. I might just send it back. Very disappointed.
2,Hard to read,"While this book has a lot of great information, it's very hard for me to sit down and read. Here's an example of a writing style: Under ""Quitting Programs"" the author writes ""If I had a twisted and warped sense of humor, I'd simly tell you to quit applications by pulliiing your Mac's power cord from the wall socket. (Luckily, I don't.) There are, however, more sane ways to exit a program..."" If you're like me, and this style drives you up the wall, try another book, because this book has examples like this on every page. It just gets tiring reading past the cute to get to the meat."
4,Hot Stuff,"I purchased the Rocky Mountain Range Outfitter for our Boy Scout Troop. The stove is rugged and well built, compact when folded down and not all that heavy. The only negative is that the heat output at its lowest is far to hot to cook our meals over a period of time rather than temp. I am unware of any adjustment we can make to tune this hot shot down but we are prepared and we have overcome this problem with a couple pieces of conduit to raise the skillets off the burners."
2,Better Stoves Out There for the Money,No wonder the company went out of business. I bought one of these stoves and received lousy support and service. I bought some barbeque grates along with the stove and they arrived damaged. The company refused to follow through on replacing the damaged product after committing to and followed through with verbal abuse of the customer (me).The grill overcooks everything even on the lowest setting. The company that made these sourced them from China and only designed them in the US. Everything was riveted together making it impossible to service & clean the burners and basin. Also the powder coat chipped easily.
5,The Person and the Situation,"The Person and the Situation, I searched years for this book and even contacted the author via email. He responded that it would be converted to digital format if there were enough request. There were so many requests for it they finally issued it in digital format. If you have any interest in Social Psychology this is a must read! It was worth the effort tracking it down and waiting for."
3,if it was not dubbed this would be a great movie,"I love haunted house movies since i was a kid so when i found out Fangoria was doing one I was really excited. When i got the movie the actors seemed passionless I noticed it was dubbed and it seem all wrong, they can't possibly be saying this its boring!!! This is a really bad situation and they sound like they are just reading off the lines. Finally I tried it in Spanish okay the passion was there now but the subtitles seemed wrong. Finally I got a friend from Spain to watch it for me and translated it. It was great. I just wished that they had enough money to get really good translators and voice actors. So 5 stars for the movie 4 stars for a bad sub and 3 stars for a bad dub."
1,This film deserves NO stars and so you know is dubbed! SPOILERS,It was all I could do to stay awake in this weak boring dubbed film that sounds so bad I had to switch to the original Spanish language with subtitles. The Haunting is supposed to be a Ghost Story but fails in every aspect. Some of the worst acting I have ever seen and that says alot as I am a huge Horror fan. A Dr. and her Husband and newborn move into a house and hear things...Basically that is it. HORRIBLE!
4,Outstanding Work,"The first time you listen to this record, you will think it's not bad. The second time, you'll think it's pretty good. The third time, you'll think it's brilliant. It takes 3 listens to appreciate the ""complex simplicity"" of this record and when its contrasted to the other solo works, and the Fleetwood Mac era material, it really leaves you shaking your head and wondering if Mr. Buckingham made some sort of deal with the devil for his seemingly unending talent. The only criticism is the overprocesed vocal arrangements."
3,Very hard album to review,"I am a big Lindsey and Fleetwood Mac fan and his out of the cradle album is one of my favorites, as for this new one, its a mixed bag.There are some truly good songs on this disc, there are 3 excellent tunes, 4 or 5 good tunes and the rest is a mixed bag. I really like his electric guitar playing and not having it on this album kind of turns me off a bit. He has always done the quirky breathy style of singing but after awhile the novelty kind of wears thin.Afer the first listen i didn't really think much of the disc but after a couple more listens it has started to grow on me. Lets just hope he gets back into the studio with his electric guitar perhaps invite in a few friends to play and crank out a really fun record and do it before another 14 years pass, now that would be something to look forward too.TC"
1,WHY????,"EVERY SO OFTEN A TALENTED MUSICIAN OFFERS UP A CREATION THAT MAKES THE LISTENER THINK ""WHY""???? WELL THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS REVIEWER THOUGHT AND IN MY OPINION THIS IS MY BIGGEST DISAPOINTMENT OF THE YEAR FOR RELEASES.LINSEY'S VOCALS ARE MUFFLED WITH AN ANNOYING ECHO EFFECT AND IF THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO CREATE SOME SORT OF AMBIENCE,FORGET IT.THE SONGS,WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A REMAKE OF THE STONES ""I AM WAITING"",ARE VERY MEDIOCRE AND BELOW THE STANDARD TO WHICH LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM CAN PRODUCE.I UNDERSTAND THAT MOST OF THE MATERIAL WAS RECORDED IN HOTEL ROOMS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT!!! PASS ON THIS RELEASE,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
4,Awesome Guitarist!,"This is a very enjoyable album. Most of the album is acoustic, and showcases the outstanding talents of Lindsey's guitar playing. His vocals sound as good as ever. A lot of the songs sounds very similar though, and probably the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars. I did see Lindsey Buckingham this fall on tour, and these songs sound even better live. Of course he played many of his classic solo and Fleetwood Mac songs, including Second Hand News, Tusk, Never Going Back Again, and many more. I don't really think you can fully appreciate the talent of Lindsey Buckingham until you see him live. This concert blew me away, and makes me enjoy this album that much more."
1,Did anyone oversee the production of this?,"Lindsey is an amazing talent, but this recording is a total disaster. His chosen vocal style for most of the songs sounds like he is half-singing, as if he does not want to wake up his children taking their afternoon nap in the next room. There is a lack of audio depth throughout, the only track that comes close to being a real ""song"" is a cover of an old Rolling Stones tune called ""I am Waiting"", but it's still marred by this low powered vocal rasping. I really don't know why someone did not grow some cajones and stop this mess from being released; I hit the purchase button based on being an absolute fan, but now I want my money back."
2,Under the Skin and Overproduced,"An acoustic album is an awesome idea, but if only if it is executed properly. When a singer/songwriter is alone with his guitar, there is no need to super-produce everything. Lindsey's overlapping, echoing voice come across as more distracting than innovative. Hi breathy voice is less mystical and more exhausted, as if trying to prove something.The disc is not a total disaster, but it made me long the days of ""Never Going Back Again"" and the acoustic versions of ""Go Insane"" and ""Big Love."" Sometimes a song is a song, and it is what it is."
4,Never Too Late,"The most under-appreciated guitarist in the annals of Rock `N Roll, this his passion play; an intricate delve into his psyche where, for the first time in years - perhaps ever - he displays a coherence in his intrinsic confessional that threads the sum of its parts to create a gorgeous entity, without an iota of self-indulgence or pretentiousness. There's strangeness to it, still...the layers reflect an eerie, haunting serenity piece, interrupted at times with his genius fingerpicking craft. Stevie Nicks should take notes on its beguiling intimacy. My grade: A-"
3,"Well, it's no 'Gift Of Screws.'",Gift Of Screws: The unreleased studio album that was to follow 'Out Of The Cradle' but most of it became the excellent Fleetwood Mac album 'Say You Will.' Bootlegs can be found so do a Google seach. Overall not bad but not as good as I expected. The more I listen the more I like so it can grow on you.
2,Hasn't grown on me yet,"I have all of Mr. Buckingham's solo work and, so far, this is my least favorite. Although normally I like his work from the first time I listen to it that is definitely not the case with this cd. I am just hoping that after repeated listening it will grow on me."
2,Shocked,"My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy."
3,Love Solo Buckingham,"...but this is not my favorite effort to date. Nothing really broke out for me as on all previous titles. I'm glad to have the new work, but maybe not the best intro for someone unfamiliar with his non-Fleetwood work."
2,"Its. OK, I am disappointed !","I expected something less depressing. Don't get me wrong, Lindsey is my favorite guitarist, but I don't like what direction he was taking on this CD."
2,Cold album,"I listened to this album prepared to fall in love with it, but there was way the heck too much reverb and the low end was almost non-existent. I feel physically cold when listening to this album because of the lack of warmth. It sounds like it was recorded on an old tape recorder because of all the hissiness of the music itself. A lot of the musical texture is lost because the reverb and off-key layered vocals drown out most of the charm of the songs. I can't say it's terrible, but I probably will only listen to it a few times. The overall quality is a step up from Law & Order, but that isn't saying much. I am tempted to run it into my own studio to make it half-way enjoyable. There are a few good tracks on the album, but the breathy vocals that are so in style at the moment are oppressive even from someone who can pull it off, but the performance was so off-key on this album that I cringe when I hear it."
2,Pro photos of ugly models,"This book contains professional nude/seminude photographs, primarily of homely and 'sturdy' looking models. The cover represents about ten percent of the book's content."
2,There's better books.,"I've purchased much better photo books for alot less money. If you like pantyhose, stockings and garters, you'll love this book. If you like nude bare legs, you'll hate it. Also has some chunky and not at all attractive models."
2,Don't judge a book by it's cover!,"Talk about 'Judging a book by it's cover', DON'T. Out of all the photo's on this book, the best looking one is on the cover of this book. This photo's of this girls in this book were probably taken at a run down W****House which most of this women are not natural beauties. Some photo's on this book were badly taken and really does not describe the name of this book at all. I bought this book to see some natural beautiful LEGS on women, but the majority on this photo's were women with split teeth, fat elephant legs, and some of this women had minor bruises on their legs which the photographer tried to hide by having this women covered there bruises with black stockings. Again, 50% of this book has great photo's of good looking women, but if you want to see photo's of womens ""LEGS"" in this book, I would NOT recommend you to buy this book at all."
1,band aid,"the paper the skin was on was poor and came off with the skin and in my opinion the skin is of poor quality didn't look like carbon fiber, more like a band aid. shipping was fast though"
5,Extensive yet to the point,"Professor Maital is very clear in his writing style and introduction of these 10 key economic tools. He elegantly analyses series of real life examples and provides clear cut explanations. This is one of those books you cannot put down, a real page turner. The tools are real, the examples are real, and all are very intuitive and simple to implement. This book will positively impact the way you look at your company's operations and profit."
3,Ivy Gourd,"Billed as a blood sugar support, but not sure it works for me. Some may benefit, but jury still out for my own benefits...........'"
5,My sons LOVE this,"My 2 1/2 year old and my 8 month old sons love this DVD. For awhile we were dancing and singing to it everyday. I have had to order the More Playgroup Favorites so that we don't get burnt out on all the songs.I have a similar complaint about little Jay (the joey in the animated portion). I find him to be VERY annoying-but my kids like him so I can't complain too much.The DVD has the sing along option, which has the lyrics on screen. This is very handy when you are learning all of the songs for the first time. Since the words change after the first verse, it's helpful to have that feature.I think it is the perfect length for my boys. It captures their attention spans perfectly. We dance and sing to it together in the mornings and by the end of the half hour we are ready for it to be over.I highly recommend this to people with toddlers."
5,My boys love it too!,"I received the Mommy and Me Video in a diaper bag provided by the hospital when I had my second baby, who is now 8 months old. I found it while cleaning out the closet and decided to try my boys. My 2 and a half year old LOVED it! He wanted to watch mommy and me every waking moment! And my 8 month old watched it and would smile every time I put it on and he sits on the floor mezmarized by the whole thing! He also loves to watch my 2 year old run around dancing and singing to the music. He even repeats just about EVERY line from it. It has expanded his vocabulary alot. His favorite is the itsy bitsy spider. I agree that the filler is cheesy but my boys love it so much I am buying the other one right now!The biggest annoyance for my husband is that little jay has a speech impedament (it sounds like) and pronounces words wrong which makes my son pronounce them wrong. He has since corrected them but it is a bit annoying."
5,Excellent!,This was given to us as a gift and my kids love it! I would definitely recommend this (18 mo+).
4,Awesome... but should be a little longer...,"My daughter loves this to watch this. And although she can't talk real words, its amazing to watch her try and sing along... Its a really great video for learning and my favorite part... bonding greater with my little girl.... I just wish they'd make the video a little bit longer in its running time..."
4,Fun time with your baby!,Love the music and so does my 22 month old!! She loves dancing and clapping but most of all I think she loves that I'm with her doing it!!
5,Great activity for parent & child!,My 18 month old daughter and I both loved this video. She really liked the music and the dancing. The segways with Little Jay and his mommy between songs are a little lame but the rest is great.
5,baby loves it,"we started watching it when he was around 9 months while i carried him and danced along. if i put him on the ground he would crawl away. but now at 11 months he just loves it, he will sit on my lap while watching it and clap along or he would dance around to the tunes. its really cute . i think seeing the babies with their mums and dads made him notice books more, they never really grabbed his attention before, but now as soon as he sees one of my parents magazines with baby pictures on them he will scan the page , kiss the baby and try to turn the page. so i bought him a few books with baby pictures in them and he really spends time looking at them."
5,GREAT basic set!!!,"This is a fantastic set for anyone from the student to the hobbyist. These pencils are very high quality and for the price, you ge a nice selection of items in this kit. Will most definately stick to Generals for all my sketching needs!!"
4,shipping was about 80%,I like the cd but my case was cracked and will not stay closed.send me a new case and this will be 100%
2,Great hymns of the church,I am not very happy with this CD and wish I would'nt have purchased it. I love the great hymns of the church but the musical arrangements were just horrible and sounded like the melodies and the accompaniments were totally different songs. This is the second time I have experienced this with Mr. Phipps. His music has changed for the worst and I will not be purchasing any more products by him unless I have heard it first.
5,The Fortune-Tellers,"The Fortune-Tellers is an interesting story about a carpenter who wishes he could have more and wants to know about his future and what it holds. He goes to a fortune teller and asks what his future holds for him. The fortune-teller on the other hand is a fraud as you can tell just by the first thing he says. ""Rich you will surely be""...""if you earn large sums of money."" This is the kind of talk that the fortune teller tells this poor, innocent carpenter. Unfortunately the carpenter buys all this and he goes back to his work. After thinking, he wanted to know more about his future and goes back to the fortune teller to ask questions. Waiting for him is a special twist you would've never expected.This book is great for children 10 an under and even some adults. It's a great African folktale teaching one about karma in a sense."
1,Definitely NOT 8X10 - more like 7x9,"I was very disappointed with this frame for two reasons. One, the backing was wood - not velvet like I expected. The 5x7 frame was velvet lined so I don't know why this wasn't. Two, and most important: an 8x10 print can't fit in this frame. The opening for the photo to fit in the back and the glass through which you can see the print was only 7 x 9 1/4 inches. I would've had to cut one inch from every side of the print to fit it in the frame. Horrible. I sent it back to Amazon."
2,Eh...,"It works if there's a direct line of sight to the reciever. In other words, if the ipod is lying down horizontally, it won't respond. You'll want to use a dock or something else to prop it up vertically for it to work."
3,"As a Rom,aka Gypsy myself..I would say this is THE BEST FILM EVER on Gypsy culture","I give the film Time of the Gypsies 5 STARS. But to see the only formats available is just pure EVIL. And to deprive the rest of the world of the original 300 minute version, the way it was intended to be viewed, is PURE SACRILEGIOUS. This is by far Kusturica's best film ever. And the full 300 minute made for Yugo television is even better even though it was in black and white, the story is much better. I once owned this version with English subtitles which was included in a Korean 8 dvd Box set on the Films of Emir Kusturica. I paid $30.00 U.S.D. But I was stupid and gave it to my girlfriend who told me she loved it, but I know she never even watched it. And shame on me for letting it go to her. Look for the boxset you wont be disappointed and all 8 dvds are all regions."
3,ok,"I put these on my ATV at an angle to give me a wider light beam, they are not bad. Not as bright as I had hoped."
3,"loved it as a cassette tape and wore it out so got it again. Saw Alex Beaton at the Highland games years ago in Lincoln, NH.","Wore out the cassette tape I got at the Highland games in Lincoln,NH years ago from Alex Beaton who was singing there. Very nice person with wonderful sense of humor."
3,No new car scent,"This product doesn't smells like new car. Actually, it smells like Vicks VapoRub. Not a bad smell, but it was not what I was looking for."
4,Entertaining,Spear of Destiny follows a sniper in WWII. Has some good technical info and has a decent plot. Very entertaining.
3,"Good in some aspects, but lacking in others.","If you are looking for a book which features plans for multiple types of play yards, then this is not the book for you. The book does have some redeming features, however. The first couple of chapters discuss basics such as useful tools, pros and cons of different materials, and standard safety practices. It was these first few chapters which I found very useful as I began to design a play yard for my children. The rest of the book describes how to build the play yard featured on the book's cover. If you're looking for a solid, fun play yard and don't have creative aspirations of your own, then the featured play yard is, indeed, very functioanl and fun. If, however, you're looking for many different styles and ideas to incorporate into your own design, then look elsewhere. Overall, the book was a good starting point to learn more about what goes into a play yard."
3,"A good book, but...","...it only has one design for each component. We were hoping for a book that had several designs in it (at least for a play yard). The play yard plan included is the one you see on the front of the book. It also includes one plan each for a playhouse, covered sandbox, balance beam, picnic table, and teeter-totter. The book is still VERY helpful on tools needed, wood to choose and other basics, but the materials lists and such won't work if you aren't going to build exactly what's in the book."
2,no selection of structures,"I was very dissapointed with this book. It only has one ""master"" plan which includes a climbing structure, slide and swingset. The ""optional"" plans are simply the elimination of one of the master plan segments (e.g. without the swingset). Also, the plan is quite elaborate and expensive to build. It may be good for a church or school, but more than a typical family could undertake or afford."
4,trilling spellbinder,"I couldn't put it down. Though not much of a reader,I found this book to be unlike any other. I loved it!!!"
4,Funko Yoda Bobble Head,"This is a good sized Yoda bobble that actually mostly looks like Yoda.The only reason I didn't give him 5 stars is because he has gray hair painted on. I don't recall Yoda having any hair.Other than that, it bobbles nicely, and the light sabre is not too shabby looking, either. Definitely a steal, IMO."
4,Yoda Rules!,I bought it for my 3 year old son who loves Yoda. The bobble head is great for displaying only. My son broke the light saber at the base the second day we received the item but we superglued it back on and it looks good. It now sits up high on a shelf.
5,CHRISTmas gift,This was a gift for my daughter and she seems really very pleased with it!!!! It was a nice size and I don't know what else to say to rate a bobblehead.
5,The best humor book I have ever purchased!,"Tom Tomorrow sarcastically satrizes everything that makes up this modern world. His book is one that you can read four or five times over, and still laugh out loud every time. $8.95 is definitely worth this treasure"
5,Best CD yet,"I've gotten quite a few CDs this year, but the new KoRn one has to be my favorite. I'm always listening to it, and my friends end up hearing it a lot. They never like KoRn, but they couldn't tell it was KoRn until i told them, then they went out and bought the CD. This CD is all the sounds from their old CDs put onto a bunch of great new tracks that will keep me entertained easily until there next one."
5,korn improvement,I recommend any KoRn fans out there buy this cd don't burn it that's no way to support the band. The band is ever improving and this cd shows they will be around for years to come.
5,KoRn '94 Back Again!?,"I never thought this would happen, especially following behind the releases of ""Issues"", and ""Untouchables"" but KoRn acctually pulled it off, ""Take A Look In The Mirror"" is easily compared to KoRn back in the days of '94. If not, then at the very least KoRn in the ""Life Is Peachy"" Days. Jon acctually screams again on this one (not that wierd crap he did on the 2 albums listed above)... Anyway... Buy this album, for you or someone that likes Metal, Alternative Metal, Rap Metal, Emo, Anything Hard.. You/They will not regret it... take my word on it."
5,K##KEN Brilliant,"Korns done it again, this time they've hit the jackpot, this album was brilliant, this album was alot heavier than their last one, it was a great hit among my friends and i were i live, but a couple of their songs were a bit weak, but overall it was pretty good, id like to see another video off the album though, cause theyd be pretty cool"
5,Take A Look In The Mirror,This album is for a true KoRn fan. This album will take you back to where KoRn came from and show you who they really are. They are their own producers so noones looking over there shoulder. If you don't buy this cd you wont be able to look in the mirror anymore. BUY IT!
5,Great new Korn C.D.,"I think that the new Korn C.D. will definetely outsell most other C.D.'s.IT is a masterpiece in its own right, and proves that Korn is going to be around for a long time to come."
5,new korn c.d.,"for music listeners of all ages.korn is back and better than ever with there all new album titled ""take a look in the mirror"""
4,Instramentally... Great,"I loved the instruments on this album. Great guitar, bass and drumming. Lyrically, not so good. Jonathan Davis must have been struggling in this period. His lyrics sounded Immature for the most part. Did My Time, Counting On Me and Alive are the best on this album, Alive was originally a song on the Korn Demo ""Neidermeyers Mind"" too by the way. The song ""Play Me"" was HORRID. But the instruments were so damn good, I give this album 4 stars, just for that."
4,Nice album,"Reminds me of their older mid-90s material. This album is way better than their other new trash, and can almost compare to their older stuff.Check it out if you have been missing their more dark and heavy style."
3,Getting better.... slowly,"I must say that I'm shocked that Korn could make a decent cd again and they have with Take a Look in the Mirror. My personal favorite song on here is track 10, Lets do this now. The musical aspects of this cd is awesome but Jonathan Davis' vocals still sound terrible when hes singing, unlike earlier albums. This cd in no way should even be placed on the same shelf as their Self Titled ablum or Life is Peachy, but check it out, you cant hate it any more than Untouchables, its an improvement..."
3,Really B@D A$$ Critic,"I wish David to change drum setup to Issues's (with THE BEST! snare drum I have ever heared & cable hat with sleigh bell installed on it). If do not count that Korn made Untouchables & david's drum setup (that was on Untouchables - it sounds as in forgotten rock; the kick, fieldy's bass click snare drum sounds very badly (look at Issues & earlier) ride & other metal sounds sounds like low-pitched) - album is not bad, really not bad! But It could be better. In tracks with bagpipe didn't need to leave bagpipe's part only in the beginnig of the track. But I always will be with them cuz they are good, cool people. Most of all I wanted to ask Korn - it's to let the live shows be recorded on the TV (bootlegged & etc.) cuz for people like me, that living in Belarus & some near countries, this is the only way to see korn."
2,There There,"Well...i rather enjoy the DVD than the CD's. This album is still awesome and rocks! But because they produce thier own album the material is not as bright as other album before who produce by other hands. There's no quality control on this album. I know they wants to do evrything with produce their own album. But sometime we must listen to the other to judge our creation, right! So far...for the hard core scene this album is a must even lack of melody here..."
2,Disapointed,I love Korn's music and i liked all the other albums a lot. This album is a new sound for them but the cd is way too repetetive. All the songs on the album sounds pretty much the same. Jonathan seems to have lost the emotion he put in the other discs and now it seems he just screams for the hell of it. It was disappointing in my opinion but if you are a KoRn collector like me you probably should get it it isnt a total flop songs like Did my Time and Right now are definitly good songs.
1,SUCKS!,"this album sucks.Save yourself the extra cash and just pick up their first 4 albums (Korn, Life Is Peachy, Follow The Leader, Issues) because those are the only ones worth listening to, everything else that they put out after those albums is garbage."
5,koRn rocks my socks!,"The new cd, take a look in the mirror is simply awesome. That really is all I can say. I listen to it at least three times a day. on my way to skewl, during skewl on my way back, at home. all the time. It's not the usual koRn but i'm always up for something new and different. It's great. buy it. ok. thanks. you have to hear it to believe it. kewl."
5,different but good,"at first when your hear this cd , u may be thinking , what the hell?, i mean its a great cd musically and vocally of course as all of korn's cds are but its not as serious as the last 5 cds korn has giving us, korn just wanted to have some fun and write a live cd , a cd where all the songs would be good live with an audience , like youall want a single , its jsut a fun F*ing song to sing. With this cd you also can tell jon has been working on his voice , he gets into deep growl screams a few times when he rarely does and he keeps the catchy low singing voice also. oh yeah dont forget jon plays the bagpipes , so get this cd now , korn fan or not!"
1,"Wow, Korn really sucks","I know there are a lot of obnoxious idiots out there writing raving reviews of this crap-fest put onto a CD... but if you have an ounce of musical critisicism or intelligence, don't waste your money.Korn has become over-produced, lame and unable to write a decent lyric or guitar rift to save their life.I remember their first album coming on to the scene and bringing a lot of ingenuity and talent with it. They've now devolved into a blubbering goo of crap-mainstream rock that you find overplayed on most ""hard rock"" radio stations.Please, don't reward these talentless losers with your money."
1,korn is trash,"any band that claims to be metal and tries to add a rapper to the mix needs to be killed... RAP AND METAL HAVE NO PLACE BEING PUT TOGETHER, PERIOD, THE END. bands like korn are a shame to the metal community. if you are as tired of this samey, boring tripe as i am, you might want to check out some real metal bands like opeth, emperor, dimmu borgir, or immortal."
4,korn,"well the cd was good but track 8 didnt really appear to me as that well written.the bonus track was really really good, it was like taking metallicas guitarist' and drummer and put jonathan davis on the mic. and fieldy on the bass it gave me goosebumps."
5,It's KoRn Of Course It's Going To Be Great!!!,It's a mixture of all their cds with a new twist. It's really excellent. Everyone should love KoRn!!!
5,Korn album #6,take a look in the mirror is very different from the last korn album. the songs are great and jon davis does some screaming to give the album a hardcore feel. they still have the classic metal sound but have enhanced it with some new twists.
5,Korn tkae a look in the mirror,"This album, definitely puts a foot in the mouth of anyone who has doubted Korns musical abilities at any point through there awesome march of groundbreaking sounds and musical style. I being an avid korn fan and owning and rockin all of their albums on a daily basis can say with utmost confidence that their new album ""take a look in the mirror"" is unparalelled in it's greatness. Once again Korn has proven that they are truly here to stay!"
5,Korn did it!,"You have to buy this record and listen to all the tracks. If you're a fan, you'll love the way korn sounds, and if you're not a fan, BUY THIS RECORD, LISTEN TO IT, and you'll automatically love the way korn sounds."
4,What happened to them???,"I love korn so much! I have to be one of their biggest fans,but they have really gone down. This is a good cd, but I would recommend life is peachy, or untouchables instead, listen to me I know what i'm talking about. I'm not saying this album sucks, but it is not as good as their old albums."
5,awesome CD!!!!,"this cd is great.evry song on it is great.this album is basically a mix of all of korns songs and influences as i wuld like to say it.The DVD verison kicks a** too.i wuld reccomend this CD to anybody who wants to hear a good, great, kick a** Korn CD that has evrything that u culd possibly want to hear about Korn.KORN F**KIN ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,good to hear,"well, it's about time korn realeses an album that i really like since follow the leader. issues and untouchables really started to get me worried that the korn i grew up with and loved was turning into garbage, but i was quite impressed. im sure the greatness that self titled and life is peachy was a one time thing in their careers when they where at their peek musicly, but this album has riffs that brings back some fond memories of what they once where. and jonathan actually SCREAMS again!! its about time, i missed that. But its still not the Jonathan all us old schoolers first loved :(. o well, ppl change, and this is a good ablum."
5,Amazing,This is honestly the most hardcore album of this year and Korn's best since their Debut. The riffs are heavy and rock and the lyrics are eery and dark. An excellent CD for any true rock fan and a definate MUST buy for anyone who likes KORN.
5,awesome!,"Ive been waiting for this for so long!! The old korn is back and the old korn is the whole reason why i like korn so much and this album rules!!!!! The best songs are ""right now"" ""play me"" and ""yall wanna single"" this is a definately get album from any long time korn fan cuase its not like untouchables which sucked booty, its the old korn!! and im happier than ever! so go out and get this, you will not be disappointed!"
5,Great album!,"This is one of the greatest albums KoRn ever made. It contains the best elements found on every KoRn album, plus new elements. All that put together makes an awesome album. KoRn is really the master of all heavy bands!!"
5,Holy crap! This is awesome!,"This album has made a true Korn fan out of me. It is so killer. It's loud, it's hard, it's just awesome. This is the best of Korn's albums. I love the guitar licks. My favorites are Right Now, Play Me, and...oh yeah....all the other songs. This whole album kicks major a$$! If you're into hard rock and metal, you absolutely have to buy this album. This is one of the best albums of all time, no joke."
1,I won't buy it again,"I got two at the same time, they are not sharp at all, both my wife and my mom can't use it since they are not that strong to put down the cutter..."
2,Strong Scent,"I ordered the gift set and it came as advertised. Very cute package. Unfortunately no one sells this product on the east coast (that I could find) so I could not test it. It is far too strong a scent, even the lotion. The candle filled the house with the scent in 10 minutes. My advice, find someone or someplace that offers this product before purchasing."
4,Listening cassettetapes,"I would like to know how I could get the 3 listening comprehension cassettetapes of this book, I was looking for them but I didn't receive any answer"
5,under 13,"under13 is the age of childhood, when a child like to spend his lots of time in playing and studing. but in these age(under13), a child like playing all the time. when i was child i was very noughty. i did many wrong things which was not accepted by elders."
4,WOW!,THIS IS AN INDEPTH STUDY OF THE BOOK OF MATTHEW.THIS BOOK IS RECOMMENDED FOR THE STUDENT AND PREACER WHO DESIRES AN INDEPTH EXEGISIS OF THE MATTHEW.PASTOR
3,"Good and Dated, not Great and Recent","This is a good semi-critical commentary on Matthew from an Evangelical perspective. I must confess that I was a little disappointed with this commentary since so many people speak so highly of it. It is certainly full, usually insightful and reliable. However, Carson spends too much space trying to refute either old or obscure theories which do not necessarily help anyone in understanding what Matthew has actually said. Relatedly, the book seems even more dated than its publishing date (mid 1980s) and does not deal with any of the more recent and intriguing scholarship on Matthew. In sum, the book needs to be heavily revised and updated to make it competitive with other more recent commentaries like those by Blomberg, Morris and Hagner."
5,Tree Hill Was Part Of My Teenage Years !,"What Shall I Say About A Show That Shaped My Teenage Years! This Show Was Wonderful Even Though I'm A Bit Bitter About Peyton & Lucas Leaving & I'm 50/50 About The Other Cast Members!

5,One of the best TV series ever,"I grew up watching One Tree Hill. It began as a high school drama show and evolved into a mature, young adult series. I am sad it ended but all great stories must come to an end. Even though the show is over if you haven't seen the series you should watch it from the beginning!"
5,fun to watch,my doughter loves this show and now she can watch it whenever she wants. A great gift idea for anyone who likes the show
4,My most favorite show ever.... One Tree Hill,"I gave it 4 stars because No matter how many times I try it, I can't get episode 7 to work right. For this rest of it I'm very happy about this purchase."
5,"Great show, Arrived on timr","This was such a great series. A lot happened is this season, and I was extremely sad to see it end. I don't like the fact that they ended it with no real opportunity to extend the show in the future, but there are ways to do so. I really hope they do. I loved this!"
4,"Prompt, quick,","Great way to finish the series, blanket clinching and tear jerking. So sad it's over! It was great to see all the faces pop up for the last few episodes."

5,OTH Deal,It was a great deal and just what I wanted. Came well packaged and ready to watch. Awesome buy for One Tree Hill Shows.
4,Great gift,"First of all, I'd like to point out how hilarious it is that the first question of this review was ""Are you over 13?"" Bahaha, sorry... I guess a lot of 13 year old's must watch this.I bought this for a friend as a gift and she loves the show. Not my kind of show but I consulted her before creating the review. She does tend to like the beginning few seasons better than the latter, but still needed to complete the series."
5,I live OTH!!!,"Streaming quality is great, sound is great, easy to navigate through and pick which episode you want to watch. Fantastic show."
1,April 19 2011: Have not received this item ordered on Feb 19 2011,I don't know where or how to complain but I have not yet received the book? What do I do?okeoma.agu@gmail.com
2,Too much fluff,"Apart from the introduction to RFID in the initial chapters the rest of the book is of little use. For example - Chapter 17 is on ""Is outsourcing right for you"". Chapter 16 spends time on explaining why ROI should be used as a measure to evaluate RFID projects. I wish the author had stuck to core RFID concepts rather than mixing business strategy and finance issues. There are plenty of other sources available for that.Overall, the first half is a decent introduction to RFID concepts. Not nearly enough if you are embarking on a real project though."
5,Fairouz has done it again!,"Fairouz is the unchallenged queen of Arabic music and one of the greatest singers on record. Her voice is rich and sinuous, with the soulful intensity of a Billie Holiday or Edith Piaf, but a warmth and sense of phrasing all her own. This retrospective ranges from her first recordings in the fifties up till now and gives a superb picture of her work. The music perfectly framing her aching laments and flowing melodies, like a gentler version of flamenco or a continental cousin of Cesaria Evora's morna. The emphasis is on the deep, passionate wording, and it doesn't get any better than this!"
2,I'm not convinced.,Maybe it would have been clever if the author wasn't just cranking out reasons for hating every brand-name school in thr country. I don't think throwing in six top-ten lists should count as 60 individual reasons - that's cheating. Too many dumb blonde jokes in there.
1,this book is stupid,it talks about how cal supports 'deviant behavior' through our diversity policies. it's not even funny and half the stuff in this book isn't even true.
1,Finebaum bombs,"Finebaum makes some interesting points, but this book is more of a joke than a real argument. This book has limited appeal: ultra neo-cons and Stanford alumni will get a kick out of it...but otherwise I would stay away.CDA"
1,This book is crap!!,"This is by far the stupidest book I've EVER read. Don't waste your time and money.Kyle Boller--you're hot!GO BEARS, '02!!!!!"
5,1st rate from someone who knows better,"This will be a short review (for me).I am somewhat of a tea connoisseur, so for me to give a tea 5 stars... well this is a first for me in an Amazon review.Like other reviews of this product, it is a beautiful delight to watch this hand sewn tea unfold in the pot; delicate, thin first flush leaves surround a beautiful red center of hibiscus. The liquor is a light honey color, and the apricot overtones are pronounced on the palate.I would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys green (or white)teas; wants to become more familiar with them, or as a gift for someone."
1,an unreadable mess,"I am surprised to learn that Prof. Dabashi collaborated with the late, great Edward Said on a forthcoming book, as the present volume is an insult to the thoughtful, meticulous scholarship of Said. Errors in typography, grammar, fact (dates!), as well as a ridiculously repetitive, condescending tone make this the worst work in Iranian/Persianate studies in over a decade. It is less a consideration of the penetrating philosophy of 'Ayn al-Qudat than it is a study of Dabashi's anger, insecurity/arrogance and need for aggressive histrionics. Perhaps it is of best use to students of psychology; for everyone else, it is an enormous (nearly 700 pages) waste of time."
3,I was disappoited in the size.....,"I read the reviews on this bag before I purchased it, but I didnot beleive it. I purchased the bag because one of the reviews stated that the bag can hold a sandwich box, juice, and snacks. Apart from that because my son is an advid Thomas fan he is enjoying the bag............"
4,question for reviewers,"Hi fellow reviewers,I was hoping to contact the seller to request the measurements of the lunchbox since everyone said it was kind of small. Can anyone tell me how to contact one of the sellers? I don't see that option anywhere. I really want to get this for my son, but if the box won't work for us, I'll have to go through the pain in the neck return process."
3,too tiny thomas,"My nephew adores the videos, but that is not saying much. He loses it over anything Thomas related. The bag is too small and barely does the trick. When he grows out of it for use as a lunch bag, my sis will use it to hold his dvds in the car..."
3,How about looking it up on the web?,"So it has come to this. As technical fields grow and subspecialities develop, and as technology progresses and new terms are coined, who can keep track? So the author has done this for you.Neat gathering of information. Possibly the more useful stuff is the list of workshops in the various IT fields. Because, apart from that, it might simply be easier and quicker for you to look up an acronym on the web, especially if you can add keywords related to the subject, to narrow down searching.The book has limited utility. Maybe a library might find a need for it. But for most individuals, it is doubtful."
4,Interesting Thomas piece,My son is not completely into Thomas as he has less exposure to it than other kids but he did enjoy this piece. Probably more so since he likes fish and enjoys seeing the suspended shark in the water tank. It is well made and stands up well to abuse. We probably won't be getting additional items from this Thomas collection but if you are collecting this set this is a good one to get.
3,Don't use Kindle for textbooks!,"Although this is an excellent book, don't purchase the Kindle version for use as a textbook! I made that mistake and I'll never do it again! When my instructor assigns certain pages for reading, I am unable to locate them because Kindle doesn't use page numbers, only electronic locations. I also find it cumbersome to make notes and highlights. I'll go back to the real thing for class from now on!I never get rid of my books, so I don't mind underlining and writing in them..."
2,Dragging,"Overall, it was pretty good, but for it being over 200 pages, the author dragged on. I'm strongly against abortion but all through the book I was like ""when is she going to realize that she can't go through with the abortion?"" This book is nothing like ""Detour for Emmy."" All I got to say is ""I am so happy I didn't buy it."""
3,my thoughts on borrowed light,"i read the whole book in just a couple hours. i found myself getting lost in the book and feeling her feelings. i'm strongly against abortion and i am a christian. but i think in her situtation she wasn't thinking of it as a baby. i know it wasn't right for her but i dont think she had an adult in her life to teach her right from wrong. her mom was always off with the ""sad ladies"" trying to comunicate with the dead and her dad was always off in africa and her grandma was at conventions. she didn't have an adult who could teach her about sex and becoming a woman and the value of a babies life."
1,Description misleading!,"I agree with Pinkerton, description very misleading. I want to return this for the same reason!!! Says its good for walking, riding, etc. Yea, with a loooooong extension cord! Doesn't run on batteries! only car DC or AC!"
1,Very Poor product,"This product works well in the first few months if you're lucky. Then the picture goes out. If you return it to the manufacturer, it will take months to get it back. The warranty is only good for 30 days. Please invest your money in another ""portable"" DVD player."
3,movies that pause,The item was very attractive but once playing during the movie it would pause/stop and I had to either push play/advance forward to get it to continue the movie. It also got very warm while playing. Overall the delivery was very prompt and the item was very well insulated. Would buy online from
1,Stupid Design,"The company made a 4"" screen player but then put the controls on the left and right outside side perimeter sides of the player. That is the stupidest design flaw I've seen on a portable DVD player. Enlarging the width with controls completely defeats the purpose of a customer purchasing a small-screen player to begin with. How did this get to production?!"
2,Hopkins plug in wiring kit 43365 T connector wiring kit for 2000 Tundra,Easy installation. Simply plug in to connector on truck. Wires from connection to trailer plug should be a couple of inches longer. When plugged into boat trailer and turn signals are used there is a strong blinking on side selected and a light blinking of the other side. Have used Hopkins Kits for other vehicles and never had this problem.
3,Just all right!!,"Does the job fine. Not much can be written about a mic and earpiece.But I can tell you that the earclip is not a joy to put on and not at all comfortable.I miss my creative earpice cum mic whic came along with my creative notebook ultra webcam, which broke after 3 years of use."
3,"Functtional, but not comfortable","Fast shipping, product is as shown. It's about average for mic & sound. Unfortunately, it will leave a sore spot on your ear no matter how you adjust it. Also only fits on one ear - not reversible."
1,Hold the mic in your mouth if you want it to work...,"I have a couple of mics -- so I know how to configure their sensitivity in my OS. I use them for MSN, Skype, TeamSpeak and Ventrilo. I purchased this one (two in fact) because I wanted a low cost earclip-based mic.With the sensitivity turned up full blast (in the applications and via control panel), it barely picks up a sound. Unless, of course, you place the foam mic up against your lips! I am so disappointed. Two mics, two computers, same results. This is an utter waste of money. I'm dismayed that any company would even ship something like this since it isn't as valuable as the Amazon cardboard it arrived in.Maybe I got a bad batch? I can't understand that people have rated something unusable as a 3-4???"
4,good cheap product,"i bought this head set for online gaming, and use it just for the mic. i have had no complaints about the recording volume or quality but i would not recommend the output speaker for anything other than voice conversations."
3,"Ballantyne's ""The Pirate City""","While it's a decent story, it is a little difficult to get past the pro-Christian pro-British, anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim rhetoric. That's why I gave it 3***."
1,Ok...so now what?,"My 10 year-old son & I put the robot together in 20 minutes, inserted the battery, tweaked the motor alignment, tried out the 3 pre-programmed behaviours and then said ""Now what?"". In order to actually program the 'bot, a Basic Stamp must be purchased ($$$!) as well as a programming cable -- oh yes -- this, of course assumes that you have a Windows box and not a Macintosh (unless you're willing to get a Windows emulator and possibly more cables). Last, but not least, there's no prototyping area available (unless the instructions for this were buried somewhere on the supplied CD). All in all, my son and I both found this product a major disappointment!"
1,A bad kit,This is the worst kit i ever bought because it didn't work.The wheels were too cheap and the motors weren't powerfulenough. Im sure that if the wheels worked i would have liked it.
2,Maybe for kids..,"I had high hopes for this book...a complete robot in a kit, no need to go searching for parts! Unfortunately, this isn't really going to give you much experience with building robots; the only challenge was getting too-big screws into too-small holes. The robot is a fun little toy, but to program it you need to buy additional equipment, and the remote control is confusing. I found the most interesting part to be the included pdf pages on the CD, but you could get the book the pages are from for less money.This might make a neat gift for a 12-year-old, but it lost my interest fairly quickly. Don't expect a serious introduction to robots here."
1,Does not really even deserve one star.......,"My hard-earned money....Down the drain. First, the kit does not come with the BASIC stamp needed to do the computer programming. That is extra and must be sent away for. That was the whole reason I bought the kit. To introduce my kids to the concept of a computer controlling something. This kit is an extremely poor value and very cheaply manufactured. The power switch came broken and I rigged up something to work so I would not have to send back. The tires would not stay on the wheels and had to be glued on. Further, it should have come with a hardcopy of the book, not a cdrom that someone needs a computer and printer to print out 200 pages of material. This is potentially the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon."
1,How reliable is it?,"I was puzzled by the selections chosen for my hometown. Especially puzzling was the choice of Edgardo's for ""Best Latin American Restaurant"". Edgardo's is an Italian restaurant without a single Latin American offering on its menu. Since Arlington has an excellent array of Latin American restaurants, this error is inexcusable."
5,Good Stuff,"This is the classic folk music style crfeated by P,P & M . Good selection of songs very well done . I am mostly a jazz fan but can`t help but love this stuff when I`m in a certain mood."
4,Liked it but not the same song...,"I enjoyed this one except when ""Puff, The Magic Dragon"" came on. It didn't sound the same as what I had heard on the radio as a child! The rest of the CD is very good- I'd give it five stars but left one off for the ""different Puff"". If the older recorded version of ""Puff"" is what you are looking for, don't get this one, but as for the rest of their hits, it's wonderful."
1,Rumbles,I love the music content but there is a terrible background rumble that requires that I cut off my subwoofer. Could be just my CD but I am disappointed.
5,Nostalgia in its best form.,"Baby boomers who recall singing Blowin' in the Wind and If I Had a Hammer at camp or at youth groups will love this album. 25 great tracks, every one a winner, almost every one from the group's golden era. My only quibble (a minor one) is that some of my favorites aren't included. But for a one-disk collection, this album will provide 75 minutes of sing-along fun and nostalgia."
2,Not as I remember them on the radio,"Gosh, must be a remix. The selections are not as I remember on the radio. Oh well, others liked this selection more."
4,"Peter, Paul and Mary",What can you say about one of the greatest folk groups to ever record a song. Listening to this album really brings back the memories of my growing up during the time of their original release. I'm glad I bought this album to add to my collection.
2,Why No Alla Time Play??,"The CD works fine on two older CD players. It does not play at all on the unit I use which is a combination AM/FM stereo radie, tape player and CD player. (All other CDs play perfectly well on my combination).I don't think you want me check the boxes below."
3,Not much extra,Their 10 Years album had most of the great songs already. This album doesn't add that much more.
2,Peter Paul & Mary,"Being that I Grew up listing to P,P,& M I looked waited with anticipation for this Album. I was shocked to find that the volume on one track was was lower than the others. The sound person should be shot!"
3,Very Special,I have always thought these three were very good. Listening to them again makes me think I was right! Very enjoyable!
2,BUy this one instead,"I would recomend the Reader Digest Music Peter, Paul and Mary The Collection. It has more to offer and also has most of the same line up."
3,"content is GREAT, quality, however was very disappointing","Would not play at all in car cd player, and at home, several of the songs skipped to where I needed to forward to the next song."
1,Disappointed - item is badly damaged,"I am extremely disappointed - I ordered two CD's - this one was sealed, however there was not # magnetic bar code strip seal on the actual CD case, it was just celeophane wrapped - when I took the CD out of the case it had 3 bad scratches and two songs are completely ruined - I was under the impression that I ordered and paid for and paid shipping on a new CD, howver that doesn't seemt to be the case - the other CD I orered at the same time was Roger Milelr and it was perfect, hwover it was defijnitely new as it had the magnetic bar code sealing the actual CD case. The item was properly packaged and no damaged as caused by shipping"
5,Excellent CD.....,What can I say.....This CD is full of their number one hits that we all loved back then and still do to this day.
5,What's not to like?,"I ordered this CD for the wedding song but of course, Peter, Paul, and Mary are truly talented and I love listening to them whether their message is joyful or sad."
2,Good Ball but....,I bought this ball as a replacement for the SKLZ ball. This ball barley fits through the hoop of the SKLZ and bounces some what well. The only thing I was not pleased with is that it had a sticker on it that said it contained chemicals known to cause cancer in the state of California. This is quite alarming for a toy. Would have given four stars if it didn't cause cancer.

2,VERY NOISY TOY!,Based on all of the reviews here I bought this for my 4 year old. He liked it for a few minutes and then lost interest.It is VERY LOUD and there in no volume switch so it is always on loud. Add 1 screaming 4-year old and you can understand why I hid this toy in the basement. It also is made of cheap plastic and does not appear to be very durable. It is fun for adults so maybe my husband should bring it to the office tomorrow??
5,Funny Voices!,As voice changers go this is among the best I've tried. Basically you choose a setting a speak into it. Your voice sounds funny. Kids will love it and adults will get a kick out of it but it may get on parent's nerves after a couple hours of it. I find it best to space out the time kids get to play with it.
3,Nothing fancy.,Purchased this toy for my five year old son and he was entertained with it for about the first five minutes. The voice changer selections are not very good and I don't feel it is worth the $15.00 that I paid for it.
4,My 5 year old girl loved it.,"It doesn't look like a good, solid toy to me, but my 5 year old girl just loved it. I haven't seen other toys she played it so much."
2,"Not great, as a matter of fact, disappointed.","Purchased 2 of these for nephews. Amazon only had 2 available, but I needed 3 for children. Honestly, these 2 voice changers were not as good as the other one I bought for a much lower price at World Market. The one purchased at World Market was more fun, easier to use, had more of a distinction between ""voices"" AND included a battery. I would recommend buying the one that is offered at World Market."
3,Kids like it but it gets very annoying,"My 8 year old got this as a gift. He loved the toy and would not put it down. His younger sister and friends thought the toy was a blast. As a parent I enjoy watching my kids have fun but after afew minutes this toy getting annoying. They is no volume control, and alot of the voice changind option are so lod and have an afternoise like fingernails ona chalkboard. I had to limit the toy to 10 minutes at a time.After about 2 months use you was dropped once, office the trampoline (onto grass) and it started to make a loud humming noise. In the next week it slowly died. I do not plan to replace this toy."
1,Voice Changer,"Shut off button and trigger did not work from the first day. The children had loads of fun until the battery ran out. A battery lasts a day before running out because it does not ever turn off and a nearby noise can set off the lights. Maybe mine was faulty, but this flaw is a show stopper."
2,"Over priced, with little information on what you are getting","I actually sell this on ebay almost exclusively, along with all the other Pink Floyd Syncs, others? YES others! If you're looking at this you should see what i have to offer. I send you a synced dvd, no cd + vhs do it your self combo and my price is fair and low with 100's of positive feedback. I happen to use the same image as you see here but offer more for less. Check it out on ebay!"
1,A Waste,"This POORLY synch'd dvd is a waste of everything that could plausibly be connected to it!! I've done a better job at home myself w/ friends. That being said , I thought for the price even if the synch'd version wasn't good at least I would have the movie or DSOTM to watch or listen to . WRONG !! My disc only contains the VERY poorly done synch-up , NOTHING else!! The item description states that it contians all 3 tracks [perhaps the seller ""mistated""] but mine didn't .A complete waste of time , money , material , effort , etc! Save yours and DO NOT buy this item from this seller !!"
4,Dark Side of Oz,"Came quickly and in good condition - it is for a Christmas gift, so I haven't watched yet to check for viewing quality. Don't expect any problems though!"
4,I did not see that coming.,"Well, I did not see that coming. This Dennis Ward's ""baby"" is a very solid melodic rock album, with top production, great guitar playing, strong hooks and enjoyable choruses. A pleasant surprise, no doubt."
2,"The album's a bit bland, but Photograph is a great song","While this album is nowhere near as good as Kiske's solo work, and for the most part is very middle of the road blandish AOR, there is one really good song on the album (actually it's only a bonus track on some versions of the cd) called Photograph which is a definite must buy. Looking forwards to seeing how the Unisonic album comes out."
3,"Good, for a change...","I think this album is good because it features a mature M. Kiske. His voice is superb, even when the lyrics are extremely corny and sometimes ridiculous. A little too ""pop"", but still great vocals. At least we get to listen another hard rock vocalist, not only Jorn Lande or Scott Soto, or Allen...who are everywhere now..."
2,Fell apart within weeks,I've never had a violin before and thought this would be the one to start out on. It could of been cause I have never handled a violin in my life or that it just wasn't a good violin but it fell apart within weeks.
2,You get what you pay for?!,It is a cheap price and a fairly cheap violin. The pegs have a hard time staying in place even after trying their suggestions. The amp is so so. The bow is actually pretty good. The e string broke almost immediately even with a violin teacher tuning and trying to get it working right for her. Still working with it but overall pretty disappointing.
1,Burst into flames !!,"We bought the grill for going to the park or the lake. My son, 6 years old, loved that he could pull it behind him. We didn't have great expectations since we all know you get what you pay for. However, we didn't expect it to burst into flames. The paint on the bottom of the grill ignited and was scorched completely off. It did burn evenly though. Kudos Aussie!"
4,My Reference in Baking,"I am using this book as a reference in the culinary program at Grossmont College. Good book, with lots of tips for the professional baker as well as student baker."
5,Excellent reference book,"As with ""The Professional Chef"", another work by the CIA, I can only find words of praise for this wonderful book.The techniques and recipes it contains are great. There's just so much information for the inquisitive chef or cook to delve into...I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that has turned baking into a serious hobby or profession."
2,not what I remembered,"i gotta say I used to love this album back in the late 70's . just purchased again thru amazon here and it really isn't as good as I remembered . . .they are quite loose, the songs don't stand the test of time, the playing not nearly as great as I remember it to be. . . surprisingly rough on groove. . . . not a true classic - i thought it was"
5,Addition Wrap-Ups a big hit at our house!!,"I bought a set of Addition Wrap-Up Keys for my homeschooled 5 yo daughter thinking that when she started to get into addition she might enjoy these more than workbook pages. As soon as I opened them she couldn't wait to try them. I briefly showed her how they work, and was amazed to see her pick up addition so quickly. Instead of using them to suplement her other math, I feel like we are using her other math to suplement the Wrap-Ups. I think this is a wonderful product. They are small, portable, self contained, and self correcting. They are great for using at home, in the car, the doctors office or to visit grandma. Right away, I bought the subraction set, and am planning to buy the others too, as soon as she is old enough to use them."
4,Great substitute for flashcards,"My 7 year old son uses these and prefers them to flashcards. We both do, actually. It does take a little bit of coordination on his part to keep the string from slipping off the correct answer; he just lays it on the desk. Great for learning basic math skills!"
5,Great repetition tool,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter. I make her practice one key a day as soon as she returns home from school. Her memorization is starting to stick. As a result, shes able to add more efficiently off the top of her head. She's also starting to add in the 2 digit addition facts in the ones and ten column!"
3,NOT SURE YET!,"JUST NOT SURE IF MY DAUGHTER HAS CAUGHT ON TO THE IDEA. SHE IS 6 NOW AND IS NOT REALLY INTERESTED. SHE IS LEARNING BEST WITH HER A BEKA HOMESCHOOL CURRICULUM, PERHAPS IF WE TRY IT NOW IT WILL HAVE BETTER RESULTS. ;)"
3,A Pleasant Novel,"I have to agree with the first reviewer. While Miracle was better than Impossible by far. It didn't wow me either. The story of three main characters Quinn,Jack, and Maggie. Each in their own way trying fight their own personal battles. Basically this story is about love, redemption and renewal. If you are looking for a nice pleasant read this is it."
1,BORING BORING BORING - Did I mention BORING?!?!,"I tried as hard as I could but just could not get into this book. Not quite as bad as her book, ""Impossible,"" but close. Danielle Steel is getting so repetitive in her writing. Basically, this book repeated over and over how much Quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he didn't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying/dead. Drivel. She could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves, but no. A waste of time. Very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all. Disappointing, to say the least."
2,Just a little to sweet,"Quinn Thompson is still trying get over the death of his wife when he meet Maggie Dartman after a violent storm one night. But Maggie is also dealing with pain and lost. But these two people are drawn together over their love for sailing. But Quinn is determined to move on and out of Maggie's life.""Miracle"" by Danielle Steel is the first book that I have read form Ms. Steel in a long while, and it was sweet for me. It seem that Ms. Steel just kept driving home her point when she didn't have to. If you want to read some good Steel books, check out her earlier works and not ""Miracle."""
1,I'd rather watch grass grow!,"I've read almost all of Danielle Steele's books and have enjoyed them. This one was a big disappointment. Boring, blah, takes forever to get thru the introduction of characters,what were you thinking Danielle?"
1,Meh,"This was my first DS book, and I was curious to see what the hype was when my coworker gave me a bunch of her old books (this one included). I had heard many things about her and was happy for the opportunity to get a nice used DS book that I could 'try' out.I was disappointed. Ms. Steel repeats herself. A lot. Like, over. And over. And over again. She just found different ways to repeat the same thing, and what was a plot with promise was derailed by the monotonous and repetitive storytelling.Did I mention she repeats herself a lot?Sorry, I just had to make a point. ;)"
4,Miracle,I actually thought that is was one of her better books. I have not been able to get into the last two books but this one reminded me alot of Danielle Steel's old books. I really did enjoy this book.
1,Show don't tell,"Where did they get the reviews on the cover of this book? The resemble nothing I found in reading this.One of the first rules of writing is ""show- don't tell"" Danielle Steel took the low road in writing this simple tale. The plot is extremely weak and the way it is told... is well ""told"". The feelings and inner thoughts of the characters are told to us, not shown. The character are told to the reader to be lonely, sad, etc. Instead of being in positions that relect that state and therefore allow the reader to conclude that. It is very amateurishly written. I am afraid she was simply trying to pump out another book, and rest on her laurels from the past. tsk tsk tsk..... lazy."
2,Another Snoozer,"While this was nowhere near as bad as IMPOSSIBLE, this was just boring and very repetitive.And the end - the storm - wasn't that in Bittersweet? A storm on a yacht and the hero comes to claim the heroine??I have read Danielle Steel for half my life now.....named my daughter after her....but I long for the day when I can say ""She's BACK!"""
4,It did my heart good,"Although the story was somewhat predictable, it was a heartwarming account that left me feeling lost for the characters when I finished. I enjoyed this quick read."
1,Miracle,"It probably took me longer to read it than it took her to write it. Some of her books have some historical or other interest, this one does not."
4,miracle fun to read,Another fine book by Danielle Steele. Fun to read and good plot that will keep yourt interest.
3,Looking for a mindless romance novel?,"It's why I still read Danielle Steel. No, her writing is not a fraction of what it once was. Yes, I wish her stories would dare to be about something different and new and fresh. However, I am a hopeless fan and do enjoy an ocasional mindless read in between books I consider more serious. Thus, DS does her job for me.I did enjoy the friendship of this story. I also enjoyed the lesson it was trying to incorporate. Overall I enjoyed the reading, but would most definitely recommend an older DS novel for anyone looking to read her books- Message from Nam, Star, Daddy etc."
3,Sweet Story,"It is a wonder what a simple can do to the life of 3 different person. Danielle Steel have done it well...It is a pity to me to Jack did not end up sailing with him, that would be perfect for all a threesome..."
4,A well written analysis of little known Civil War battles.,"Most Civil War buffs concentrate upon the war east of the Mississippi. By comparison, the two battles of Pea Ridge and Prairie Grove are obscured by their distance from the main scene. I was interested, as my g-grandfather set up and ran a field hospital at Fayetteville, during the battle of Prairie Grove, Arkansas. The book is one of the best I've read in it's description of the tactics employed. Even better, the timely maps are simple, clear and placed closely to the verbage they cover. Similarly placed are short biographies of the major officers on each side of the battles. Unit narratives seldom drop below company level and the book cannot be considered an exhaustive study. But, at the end of 126 pages, a reader will have a sufficiently clear view of the events to gain a good grasp of the strategy and tactics used in these two important battles."
1,Not for the intermediate/advanced exerciser.,"I'm on maternity leave right now and wanted to get back into working out. I do boot camp type workouts normally, but wanted a little more cardio. I found this DVD set at Marshalls and decided to try it out. It was too easy, I didn't even break a sweat doing both workouts. It's probably a good workout for beginners, but not for me."
2,Somwhat cheesy,"I bought three of these for my kids thinking that they would add some value to our already sizeable investments in DS's. The case is fair, the car adaptors may come in handy, but overall the cradle is useless and the game cases are very cheaply made. Still, the set is inexpensive enough, so if you are in need of any of the components it could be worthwhile."
2,DOA,"This book arrived with everything stacked against it. ""The Twin Dilemma"" was the first full story featuring the 6th Doctor, who would soon be reviled as the least favorite of all Doctors. It didn't help that TTD is an awful story, full of both unpleasant characters, annoying twins, and giant slugs.The novelization, instead of toning down the 6th Doctor's unpleasant new persona, decides to jack it up a notch and make him even more irritating. Not one of the Doctor's shining moments."
3,The Twin Dilemma,I thought this book was pretty good but I would only give it a three star. I thought nancy did I great part in the story (which was the main charater). I also thought the story was almost alike to the movie that was on and I liked how the didn't change it from one another. I advise people to read this book.
2,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I thought I was getting a book that explained modify my 914, like technical info on big bore kits and engine swaps. NOPE! The whole engine chapter is an article about some guy who talks about where he took his engine to get it rebuilt and and he thinks about some parts on the engine. When it got to the section about 914/6 and engine swaps basically it said GOOD LUCK ! I feel outraged that I spent money on this book. If you are looking for good basic reading on what people think about the 914 this is a good book for that. Other then that this is not a technical book. I dont see how there is any modification info in this book!...Dont waste your money, get the haynes manual."
2,Generalist,"If you want a book to help you on how to restore your porsche 914, this book doesn't help you so much.Instead, you can buy a Haynes workshop manual that goes deeper into the details on all your porsche 914, and a haynes restorer manual on the specified subject (interior, engine, bodywork.Those will teach you something."
2,How to Restore and Modify Your Porsche 914 and 914/6,"A very poor quality copy of the original. You have the feeling that Motorbooks did this with a 16mm spy camera in the dead of night. It is, however, readable and therefore worth the money."
4,Must Have In Your 914 Library,"There is some good ""how to"" information in the book but don't expect the book to open any magic doors for you. I consider this a good addition to your Porsche 914 library. The photos are very good and certainly good on a technical level. Porsche 914 owners are bound to find some information here that they did not know. The guys involved with this book are true 914 guys, reason enough to buy the book."
4,Houston Garden Book,The Houston Garden Book was a gift for a friend moving to Houston. It was received as promised and the person I gave it to was thrilled to have the book.
2,Much Worse Than the PS II Version!,"Though the Samurai Warriors games have never been particularly sophisticated, they've always been straightforward fun slashing games with some unique storylines and fun twists. For the Wii version they updated the fighting for use with the remote and nunchuck, but took away freedom of movement and cooperative modes which is a real tragedy. Half the fun of this game was in exploring the stages and figuring out where the enemy is. Taking away that aspect leaves everything else pretty boring, although the vs. modes are much better than following the storyline. Skip this game unless they come out with a new version where they let you move!"
1,hmph....don't waste your time.,"you now all shinobi's out ther one thing about this game is that on the case ot looks appealing but then when you play the game it's like some kind of first-person shhooter only with a sword also, the graphics suck and poeple if you want an actual samurai game that kicks butt then get.SENGOKU BARSARA SAMURAI HEREOS!!COMING NOVEMBER 28,2010THAT'S MY REVIEW THANK YOU!"
1,GARBAGE!!!!,Don't waste a dime on this!!! Not very realistic and you don't even you the remote to slash. You point and the enemy with the remote and then press a button to cut them...WHAT A WASTE OF WII TECHNOLOGY!!! Wait for RED STEEL 2! :)
5,Perfect For Getting Started....,"This book is an excellent, well rounded, consise educational book on boxers. Chapters include: -The Typical Boxer -Tips on Buying a Boxer -Getting the Puppy Settled -Understanding Boxers -Training: The Gentle Approach -Daily Grooming and Health Check and, -Proper Nutrition and Feeding -Preventive Health Care and Illnesses -Breeding BoxersAs you can see this book is very complete. You will understand and appreciate boxers in a whole new way. The book also contains many wonderful color photographs,and a complete lists of additional sources for information and help in caring for your boxer.A must have!"
2,Not very helpful,"It would be a good book for people who know almost nothing about dogs, but its info is very general"
5,Great information on boxers,"This is a great book to prepare you for getting a boxer. It has great information on training and health for your new puppy. Also, it has many great pictures of boxers."
1,Not a good buy,The book wasn't too helpful. Just gave me information on things I already knew. I bought a better one for only $1.00 at a local dollar store. I advise you not to buy and just do a little web surfing online. You'll find better information.
5,Buy one before you take your next trip to Europe,"We just spent a couple of weeks at different apartments in Italy. This thing was very handy because we could plug it in once and make it our Central Power Station for each stay.If you travel to Europe often, you have seen that most places have limited empty sockets available. With this power strip, you only need ONE free plug and suddenly your power problems are over.The fact that you can plug in ""normal"" US-type twin blade or three prong grounded plugs, and also European plugs, means you only need to carry this one power strip with you on your travels.I would give it six stars if it it had different height (or staggered) sockets, so power supplies with 90 degree angle heads could be plugged in side by side. As it is built (all plugs at same height), you may have to rotate your power supplies around and mix them up, if you want to use all six sockets."
5,Perfect !!!! works like a charm,"I travel to Europe twice a year for work - and this is by far the BEST when you travel.There are quite a few here on amazon - but this works flawless.... if other people reported problems, the socket in the wall was pretty bad. I've been using this for the past six months without a doubt hands down is 100% perfect !!!!"
1,If I could have given it 'No Stars' I would have!,"Don't think for even one minute that you'll be getting anything even remotely valuable. I should have paid better attention to the publication in which this . . article originally appeared.Basically, it is a short rant against public education in America based on the authors contention that ""The system we now have is anti-Christian, pro-socialist,[sic]and owned lock, stock,[sic]and barrel by behavioral psychologists.""If you're looking for an example of right-wing fundamentalist blather (complete with poor punctuation) here is a fine example. Otherwise: don't even bother!"
1,Not kid-friendly,"Bought it for a sensory-sensitive child thinking it would help with multiplication tables, but the numbers are too hard to read and how and even why to wrap the string is not readily apparent."
4,Math help for son,"My son likes to use this in the car. It keeps him busy and is teaching him something at the same time. Due to his age I think he will outgrow quickly, but if you have someone to pass them on to it would be a better investment."
4,Replacement,"Works, and arrived quickly but it is a bit larger than the stock battery that it was replacing so it would not properly fit into the storage case the drill came with, however I would buy it again."
1,bad battery,"the company said it was a new battery. I charged the batteries, put them on the drill, and nothing. The bettery was completely dead It would not take a charge What a waste of time ordering, charging, and sending it back"
1,Not impressed.,I was upset that I paid ten times what the book was worth. On the book itself was $0.60. The book arrived earlier than expected and in excellent condition.
2,WORLD WAR II COMBAT IWO JIMA,Your area of operation was confined. The enemy would jump around like a rabbit. You had to a times almost empty your 45 into a enemy to stop him. I thought this would be somewhat like the Medal of Honor Series. Not worth the money. They should upgrade this game to the Medal of Honor or Brothers in Arms series. That would be a Ten. This game maybe a two.
5,...the most comprehensive solar electric book available,"Steven Strong's book ""The Solar Electric House"" is the most comprehensive book available regarding the application of solar-generated electricity (photovoltaics). The book is well organized, well written, and easy to understand.Although this book was first printed in 1987, it is amazingly current today (1999). I have been using this book since 1987 when I build my stand-alone PV-powered home in Prescott Arizona, and referred to Mr. Strong's book on a regular basis during design and construction of the solar-electric system. I still use this book today -- as the primary textbook in two classes that I teach at Arizona State University: ""Introduction to Solar Energy and Photovoltaics"" and ""Photovoltaic System Design""."
4,Solar Electric Home,"I found the information provided by the author to be informative and very detailed. He provided a variety of examples for system designs in varying complexities, from Stand-a-lone to Utility Interactive.My only disappointment in this book was that it seemed to be dated. It appears the last update was in the early 90's and although the principles and formulas are still practical, the equipment described by the author is not up to today's standards.If you are looking for a book to teach the fundamentals and be thought provoking, this is a good book for you."
1,History,This book was valid in its time but it has not been revised in somany years it is now history not technology. I returned it.
1,old literature,this book did not give me anymore information than already had. The book it terribly outdated.
3,"Evil Roy Slade, memory made it better than it is.",Another instance where memory and nostalgia got the better of me. I watched these when I was a kid. It was very funny then. Not so much now. I also mixed it up with the movie The Villian. Both bad guys are named Slade - Evil Roy and Cactus Jack. The Villian is better.
2,really stuppid movie,"I didnot like these movies. John Astin is not a very good actor, this was a waste of money and time watching him"
5,Evil Roy Slade,"I had seen Evil Roy Slade many years ago and remembered it was hilarious. When I watched it again, it was as funny as I remembered.The Brothers O'Toole was an added bonus I hadn't seen before, it too was hilarious!"
4,"It is just funny, a let your hair down kinda funny","I really enjoyed the movie, I make my friends and love ones watch it, some really laughed others were bored. You can see they had fun making this movie"
4,Enterprise JavaBeans - A good learning tool,"I tend to learn general concepts and then fill in the details by studying examples and then practicing. This book was done primarily from the example perspective and in my opinion is a great way to learn how to build EJBs. Before getting into each example, the authors do a fine job of explaining the specific technologies in a ""features, benfits/drawbacks, when to use"" manner. Certainly worth the price of admission."
2,NOT FOR CHILDREN OF ANY AGE; FOR DISPLAY ONLY,The only complaint that I have about this item is that the 4 laser cannons are made from very brittle plastic and are thus not at all forgiving to any applied pressure or drop from more than 3 inches. Very disappointing to have to piece them back together and affix them into place with glue.
2,not well described,This does not fit width for wheelchairs 25inch max width only. Other than that its fine for dollys or hand trucks
3,excellent Customer service,product was delivered fast and looked as described(Used). BUT it did not work out for me. So I had to return it.NO PROLEMS WHATSOEVER..
5,An enjoyable and educational reading,"I was a grade school student during the Bicentennial which was a big deal for my home town that had largely been burned by British redcoats in 1778. I have maintained an interest in the history of the American Revolution ever since. A colleague at work recommended this book for me to read after he became aware of my interest in colonial and Revolutionary War history. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the story of the two young protagonists and learned many new facts for the first time. Mr. Edgar is very well informed on the history of the American War of Independence and writes in a style that should keep any adolescent and adult interested. As I read the book, I felt nostalgia for my grade school years when I thought anything ""revolutionary"" was cool. If I were a middle school history teacher - a profession which I have considered -I would definitely assign ""Gone to Meet the British"" as required reading for my students."
2,Watered Down!,"The aroma wasn't the same as the smaller 1oz. bottles, I purchased the larger size thinking I was getting a better deal but I didn't, I can barely smell the aroma except when putting on and I no longer get the comments ""You smell good"", the aroma only last for a few minutes. I didn't want to bother with sending back but I would never order again."
4,Dennis the Menace,"I've watched this video. FYI, it also has a 4th story entitled ""Dennis of the Jungle."" Entire video is approx. 1 hour long, and each story is real cute. Just in case you wondered, the Dennis in this video is drawn just like the cartoon strip in the newspaper funnies."
3,"Good, but I liked Jeep Color History Better","I liked the book, but I thought the book, Jeep Color History by Steve Statham was more thorough and had better pictures."
4,From American Bantam to DaimlerChrysler: The Jeep Story,"This is a complete history of Jeep from military vehicle concept to Grand Cherokee Limited. Foster has done the research to show us how a concept for a military vehicle transformed itself into a full range of vehicles that has endured for a half century. Foster takes us through the many companies that have owned Jeep, showing us their strengths as well as their weaknesses in developing the products and the brand. A great story of how a unique niche vehicle could grow and thrive by defining a market even before many knew the market existed!"
2,For the Naive,"This book is filled with ideas for those who have never tried to raise capital before. But if you have worked at this before this book has nothing to add to what you have already tried. You need friends with money and influence to raise capital, anything else is climbing a ladder leaning against the wrong wall."
4,"Genso Suikoden 2, The Original Soundtrack - Worth it?","Suikoden and Suikoden 2 are known well for their high quality sound and storyline, where as they choose to graphically display the game on a very low level. The soundtrack for this game is outstanding, but then this is only seen in the eyes of the many suikoden fans out there who own a playstation. The soundtrack has many ""fillers"" in it, and these particular tracks will only be appreciated by true lovers of the game itself. My rating itself is made from my best unbiased judgement, even those it may be subject to some bias due to my love of the game. On a wider note, there are some high quality tracks on this soundtrack, whether you love, neglect or hate the game itself. All of the songs on the soundtrack convey a specific emotion. Whether it be sadness, anger or danger, you will know and feel it no doubt. My belief? Genso Suikoden 2 IS worth purchasing, but only for those who have either extensive experience from the game or a great imagination."
4,Another helping of fiery funk from the great Nile Rodgers,"From 1985, Nile Rodgers's second solo album continues along much of the same pattern as ""Adventures In The Land Of The Good Groove."" Not nearly as brilliant overall as AITLOTGG, but still a great album, and absolutely worth getting for ""State Your Mind,"" one of the catchiest, funkiest songs ever to bear his name."
4,Nice guide for preparing a ceremony.,"This is a pleasant book, but it is more of a guide for ceremony preparation, with good structure and nice ideas, but a small selection of elements and readings. It is enjoyable and easy reading. Together with another ""heftier"" ceremony book, such as Judith Johnson's The Wedding Ceremony Planner, or Diane Warner's Complete Book of Wedding Vows or another such book, it's be enough for an engaged couple to plan their ceremony. It will be staying on my shelf."
3,only for new pocket pc,"just a remainder ,this only works with pc2002 and pc2003 ,and its not the same laridan software called pocketbible that works with all pocket pc,laridan makes both . AFTER CONTACT LARIDAN SUPPORT THEY SEND ME THE LINKS TO USE WITH MY JORNADA 548 ,ITS WIN CE3.0 ,NOW WORKS GREAT ,I LIKED ESPECIALLY THE NIV STUDY .TKS"
4,Good Program,I really like this program. I have purchased three different Bible programs for my PDA and this one is by far the best of the three.
3,Toaster Review,"Nothing special. Decent four slice toaster. The slots seem a little narrow, because large bagels tend to burn a little. We love the red color and retro styling, and regular bread toasts fine."
5,Cuisinart toaster after 4 years.,"After 4 years of use, this toaster continues to work perfectly, yielding perfect toast, when the knob is set halfway to max. It's great!"
4,Toaster,"I really like this toaster. It looks great on my counter and it has the 4 slice feature that I've been wanting. The slightly annoying thing about it, is that one side of my toast seems to come out more toasted than the other side. Not too much of an issue for me, but for $65 it shouldn't have any issues like that."
4,Good Toaster,"I have had this toaster for a while now. It works well, seems well made. I have no complaints."
2,A ok two slice toaster,"I love the look of this toaster... I did not have the same issues with uneven toasting, but a little after 1 year the handle for the right side broke off. Upon opening up the toaster, it is a little plastic piece that clips the handle in that cracked.So now I have a good looking 4 slice toaster that toasts 2 slices at a time... what a waste.2 stars --- 1 for each piece of toast."
5,The Perfect Toaster,"After having bought many toasters over the years, I purchased this Cuisinart. I've owned Cuisinart Coffee Makers that I have not been too happy with but I have to say I am 110% happy with my toaster purchase. Finally, I have toast, bagels and english muffins that are toasted an even brown color all over.Cuisinart CPT-180 Metal Classic 4-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless"
3,Uneven toasting.,This toaster was bought to replace a toaster oven. The unit has easy controls and good finish but the toast is much darker on one side than the other.
2,Failed after 3 years...Is that good?,Not pleased after the right side didnt toast anymore after 3 years...and the left side would only toast one 1/2 of the bread...argh! What is the life of a good looking toaster? I am on the search - something that is dependable and looks good too..suggestions?
2,Works Great - for a Few Months,"Shiny, looks good and toasts great--for a while. After a few months you will find that the center elements get weak. This means that your bread will toast on one side while the other only gets warm. I paid big bucks at Kohl's for this thing and it is a complete waste of money. This is not a high-tech problem.BUYERS BEWARE!"
1,Shame on Amazon....and Cuisinart,"I ordered this toaster as a gift right before I left on vacation (June 30th).... I just recently returned and gave the gift to a friend.After opening the box she found that the ""shade control"" was free-wheeling and was not connected internally. The shipping box andproduct box had never been opened. Went to Amazon to find thatthe toaster wasn't returnable due to it being six weeks.....Oh well....I'm out fifty dollars....never to order gifts early again.Oh...and Cuisinart.....just more s*** from China."
2,uneven toasting,"Should have believed the negative reviews. Very poor toasting, uneven on sides, but I wanted a wide slot toaster for bagels. My cheap toaster performed much better"
3,Cuisinart toaster,"I like the toaster, but it toasts inconsistently- sometimes very dark, and other times not dark enough- all on the same settings."
1,A pricey toaster that doesn't toast correctly,"I too shelled out extra money to get a ""quality"" toaster and found that no matter what type of bread or setting I use it seems to have only two results: barely warm or burned on one side. Anything higher than 2 seems to burn, so I have to have it on the lowest setting, stand by the toaster and repeatedly toast it, switching the bread around (only the middle sides toast) and monitor carefully so it doesn't burn. Irritating. Wide slots are nice for bagels, but I too found it doesn't take many breads longer than your ""wonder bread"" square size unless you cut the ends off or put it in sideways so the edge sticks out and doesn't get toasted. The settings such as ""defrost"" and ""bagel"" don't make any difference as far as I can tell. I can't believe how difficult it is to make a toaster that toasts correctly. We're not talking rocket science, here. Maye there was a bad batch from the Cuisinart factory, but I certainly got one of them."
5,a toaster that actually works,Both sides done properly. The bagel/muffin button works well. My wife likes it
1,Toasts on one side,"Although the color is great, it doesn't toast on both sides. That was the reason I wanted to replace my GE toaster. How much does one have to pay to get a toater that actually works and looks good?"
1,Very disappointed,This toaster was a piece of junk. Controls did not function properly and toast burned. Bagel function did not work nor did the cancel function. Very disappointed in Cuisinart for producing such a low quality product. Would not recommend.
2,2 stars for 2years,"My husband and I received this toaster as a gift for our wedding. Our 2year anniversary is 4months away, and it's already dead. It worked really well until this morning. The lever won't stay down, and my husband SWORE he saw flames come out of it. We haven't done anything out of the ordinary with it.. just daily breakfast toast and the occasional bagel. There's no reason for this to A)have quit on us already or B)be a safety hazard. I'm highly disappointed, especially because we own so many other Cuisinart appliances. We'll obviously be buying another toaster.. but it won't be Cuisinart.And PS - for those of you who still plan on purchasing this toaster because of the warranty: Please note that YOU are responsible for shipping and handling of the toaster to and from New Jersey. Think about it. You can buy a cheap, and longer-lasting toaster for that same price!"
2,Looking for a replacement.,"Thought this was a great toaster at first...you could adjust to do bagels, thick slices and 4 slices at once. Worked fine for a few months and then only one side of the toast would get brown. We have to take it out and flip it. Too time consuming when you are trying to make breakfast and have to wait while the rest of the breakfast gets cold. Nice looking,convenient functions, but it just did not last for the full price we paid...not a great deal. Need to find a comparable replacement."
2,Not worth the $$,Very light weight product vs my expectations for a Cuisinart product. Also toasts very unevenly. I find myself having to toast a piece of bread twice to get both sides evenly done! This purchase has been a disappointment!
2,Terrible Toaster,"We got this toaster as a wedding gift. From day one, the right side did not work, defeating the purpose of a four-slice toaster. Now, even with the toaster set to the lowest setting, it burns everything we put in it setting off the smoke detector every time we make breakfast! I definitely would not purchase this again. On the other hand, my mom has had the same toaster for years and has no problems with it. Perhaps we just got a lemon, but why take the chance?"
2,no more cuisinart!,"Bought this two toasters and both no longer work. Just GENTLY used for breakfast times. On one of the toasters, the lever came off- put it back, but only worked a little while. With the other toaster,one side stopped toasting."
3,Not built to last,"Like another reviewer, my Cuisinart toaster bit the dust last week after two years of fairly decent performance. The lever will not stay down, and when I hold it down only one side of the toaster works. I think appliances should last longer than this, but it's a good looking toaster and I'm a little sad to see it die."
1,not a very good toaster,"This toaster only toasts on one side. It you turn it up enough to toast on both sides, the first side gets burnt. I wouldn't recommend purchasing a cuisinart product. They used to be excellent products when they really were Cuisinart. Now they have been bought out by Conair and they are as worthless as those Conair hair dryers that blow out after a few uses. Now the conair company no long has the desired color, so when I tried to get it exchanged they just arbitrarily sent a white one without even asking if it would be alright. I'll just have to keep the defective red one and put up with it. I've had my last toaster since 1995. It was made in the US and was still working fine. It just didn't have slots big enough for a bagel. I wish I'd kept it and lived without the bagels. This is the result of all of out products being made in China. Slave labor just doesn't work. I probably could have kept that old toaster until I died and passed in on to my grandchildren."
1,Not up to task of making toast,"Completely uneven toasting. A setting of 1 will burn toast, and the bagel functionality (ie, toast more on one side than the other) completely non-functional, or perhaps it is always in ""bagel mode"" and no one knows it? A look at the element intensity shows no difference when the toaster is in the bagel mode. Toast is often unpredictable as well. I think that i have the settings down, but then the second batch of toast comes out burned after a passable first batch. disappointed all around."
1,Are you kidding?,I have to agree with D. Denehan. Anything above a 1.5 comes out black!!! And if the first pieces come out just right (on a 1.5) then the second round comes out far too light. Explain that. I don't understand how there can be even one good review. What kind of toaster were you using before? We're taking ours back as well. Geez Cuisinart...what's the deal?
2,"Beautiful, but Ineffective","Put in 4 slices of toast and each slice comes up done to a different degree. Worse, for a given piece of bread one side may be done while the other is nowhere close.When you look down into the 4 slots and see different glow intensities on each of the faces you see why this happens. Another reviewer wrote about getting one bad one, then replacing it with one that worked just fine. I just took back my 3rd one and gave up.Its looks alone are worth a couple of stars. But I sure wish it worked."
2,Toaster is disappointing,"I wanted a good looking toaster that could reliably toast bread and bagels. Well, the toaster looks great. It just doesn't reliably toast bread. It is necessary to wait and watch as one day it burns; the next day you have to toast twice. (I now know my smoke detector works perfectly) The bagle setting appears to have no affect whatsoever. The stainless steel finish is beautiful, however is a fingerprint magnet. When clean, it is a very nice looking toaster. Looks 10, features 5, functionality 1."
1,Overpriced junk,"Within 2 months one handle broke off, never to attach again, leaving one side of the toaster useless. On my now 2-slice toaster, the dials for toasting darkness have never worked. Even on the lowest possible setting it will burn every bread we put in there. You have to sit right by the toaster and stop it unless you want to set off the smoke detector. On top of all of that, the metal finish started to rust almost immediately. My Cuisinart appliances have been the biggest waste of money. Look elsewhere or just toss your money out the car window as you're driving = same thing!"
1,Broke after 6 weeks,This toaster stopped working properly after 6 weeks. It now cooks on only one side which comes out dark or burned while the other side is not cooked at all. Too late to return it.
2,Unhappy customer,While visiting our son and daughter in law we used their cuisinart cpt 180 toaster and fell in love with it. It only had to set the dial on 3 and toasted perfect for one or 4 slices. Before we even left their home we ordered one for ourselves as we had been looking for years for a good toaster. Ours came and from the first day we used it we are very unhappy with it. The dial needs to be up to almost 5 before it will toast. We believe the elements inside are not positioned correctly or does not heat up properly. It does not work as well as our sons. Would not recommend this to any of our friends or rest of the family. VERY DISAPOINTED.............................
1,"Awful, do not buy this toaster!","We received this toaster as a wedding gift and it has never worked properly. It does not toast evenly and never has. One side does not automatically pop up, it will just toast until whatever is on that side burns. So basically I have a 2 slice toaster that takes up way too much counter space. Bagel feature only works on 2 out of the 4 slots as well. This toaster is a piece of junk which is a surprise given that Cuisinart is usually known for their quality appliances. We registered for this, a more expensive toaster thinking that we were getting something better that would last longer. NOPE! Will never buy another Cuisinart toaster again. Save your money people!"
1,Waste of electricity,"We got this toaster for a wedding gift as we were dumb enough to put it on our registry. This toaster looks awesome, but that's where the positive vibes end.Cons:Price (for this price it should be perfection)Doesn't cook evenlyEven on the darkest setting, it takes 2 cycles to get toast darkSmokes and sets off smoke alarm constantlyPros:Looks high endAvoid this toaster like the plague. Even as a gift I feel bad getting it as we got rid of another 2 slice toaster that cost $10 but did the job in favor of this 4 slice model. Price does not mean quality in this case, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I purchased this toaster and had problems with it from the first day. I thought it was defective so I returned it to the store and exchanged it for another same, exact toaster. The second toaster did the same as the first: half cooked toast...or, when I adjusted the knob a bit, burned toast! I phoned Cuisinart and inquired about whether they were having problems with this model. I was told they were not receiving any complaints. I requested a call tag to send it back to them for repair and they refused! They said I would have to pay for all shipping involved in repairing the toaster. I felt I had already spent way too much on this horrible toaster and wasn't about to invest another cent having it repaired! Don't buy this product: it doesn't work properly and the company doesn't stand behind their product! If I were able to rate this ""0"" stars, I would, it doesn't deserve the one star I gave it!"
1,Beauty Comes From Within,I just bought this high priced fancy looking toaster. Are you kidding me? I figured it was just a fluke that this toaster toasted unevenly/ burned one side while leaving the other side untouched. Sad to read that everyone that has purchased this toaster has the same issue. The question is - Why would a company with a great reputation like Cuisinart sell a toaster that doesn't even work? Apparently they don't think it is necessary to test the product./If you are considering this due to the beauty of it - Forget it! Beauty comes from within.
2,marginal at best,"we purchased this toaster due to the good reputation of the brand. it is only about a year old and already the burners are failing which leads to extraordinarily uneven toasting on two sides of the bread. the bagel feature is nice, but you have to constantly adjust the ""darkness"" because of the uneven toasting. extremely disappointed that this toaster does not allow you to use all four slots at the same time!"
1,Great looking but poor performing toaster,"Heed the warnings written by other reviewers: toasts unevenly. One side burns while the other is only lightly toasted.I bought it because it was a great looking toaster, and I crossed my fingers hoping that the other reviewers got a lemon or something. After much use with the toaster, however, I suspect there is a design defect with this product.If you just need something ornamental for the kitchen, this product can't be beat, but if you actually need to toast something...steer clear of this one."
3,Looks great but....,Got it as a present from my son. It matches the new Kitchen and looks really sharp! And I never had a 4 slice toaster before so I was very exited...But I cant get the perfect setting. It seems to burn my toast more often than not. Maybe I just have to get used to it.
2,Sub par quality,"I've owned this Cuisinart toaster for about 5 years now. It worked OK in the beginning; but it has fallen apart recently. The right side handle has broken off. It's a piece of metal pushed into cheap plastic, so once it loosens up, there's no fixing it. So hey, at least I still have a functioning two slice toaster. No wait, now half of the left side is malfunctioning.As long as you need 3 sides of 2 slices perfectly toasted, this 4-slice toaster is the machine for you!"
2,Cuisinart Toaster,this is the second Cuisinart toaster I had and neither of them toast the bread on both sides. I have to flip it over to get even toast. I had really thought that they would have improved it by this time. Next time I'll buy another brand
5,Love my new toaster!!!,I had this on my wishlist for Christmas and my daughter who lives in Japan got it for me. It's great she was able to order it from Japan. I love it. It works great and looks even better.
2,A bear to clean and the push-down mechanism stops working,"I just tossed out my great-looking toaster but frustrating toaster because the second push-down mechanism stopped working. The problem is that you push the button down but it pops right back up, so the toaster never turns one. The left-hand side just died; the right-hand side stopped working months ago. It also suffered from being difficult if not impossible to clean (which may be why the mechanisms failed). Ugh."
3,Fails to ding when toast is ready,"Usually you appreciate an appliance that's quiet--but not in this case! Time after time, well, every time I make toast, it finishes and just sits there getting cold because I am more efficient with my time than to stand there and watch it, to know when it pops up.This criticism might seem picky until you use this toaster yourself. With other toasters, you know the toast is ready because it dings when it pops up, or it pops up loud enough that you hear it. You can then butter your toast and eat it while it's hot. But with no audible sound when the toast pops up, your toast is more often or not cold by the time you think to check on it.Frankly, this alone is reason to pass on this toaster. Very annoying to have to stand there and watch it. Who'da thunk quiet would be a demerit! But it is in this case."
1,This Toaster Is Crumby,"By crumby I mean it leaves tons of crumbs everytime I use it. It toasts just fine but in this day in age where we can take pictures with our phones then email them from the same device, can't someone engineer a crumbless toaster?"
4,Dad loves it,Great toaster; Dad insisted on this same model when his old one died and he couldn't find one in stores.
3,Solid & reliable,My old toaster died & I needed a replacement. This is great. The dual heat settings & defrost work well.
2,Worked Great until Parts Broke,"How long should a toaster last? We liked this until the handle broke on one side (the side we use less often). I think we have had this about 2 years. So, going in search of another brand."
5,A Great Toaster,I love the Cuisinart CPT - 180 Metal Classic 4-slice Toaster in Brushed Stainless. It allows me to toast different types of bread at various toasting levels. It is easy to work the controls whether you want one - two- three- or four slices. It is easy to clean and work early in the morning when my eyes are not yet working.
2,"One side dard, the other side light","When you purchase a toaster for this price, you are at LEAST expecting an one color toast. If I wanted one side light and the other side almos burned i would have went to Wal mart and purchased a 15 dolar toaster."
2,Cuisinart toaster - very one-sided!,"I ordered this toaster about six weeks ago, and it initially did a great job of toasting bread - even and just the right amount of toasting. However within a couple of weeks, only one side was toasting. The center heating unit is not working. I plan to return the product, and get a replacement that works. I like the appearance - goes with my other Cuisenart appliances."
1,Piece of junk,"Looks great, but doesn't work well. At first it just toasted a little bit unevenly. After about a year, it began to toast very unevenly. After about another year one side stopped working. Today, the handle to depress the toast on the other side fell off. Time to go back to another brand. I expected much better quality from Cuisinart. I'm surprised they still make this piece of c***."
1,Does a lousy job,"We have had this model for 2 years (now given to Goodwill).Right from the start it does not toast evenly on both sides of the bread.Cuisinart usually does a fine job, but not with this unit.Is it so darn difficult to make a simple toaster?We replaced ours with a Kitchenaid KMT4230 & are happy with it."
1,Looks are deceiving,It would have been a great toaster if it had been built as well as it looked. 2 years after purchase it developed severe problems: first the handle would not stay down by itself - we had to weigh it down with a lid- then the outer toaster coils stopped working.Until we get a new toaster that works we will have to live with toast that is untoasted on one side and usually burnt on the other. After just one week of this we are ready to throw this thing out!I would NOT get this again NOR recommend it to a friend.
2,Stopped working after 8 months,"I bought this toaster from Macys and it toasts OK if you have the setting at 2-3. It toasts reasonably evenly too. However, after 8 months of normal use, the lever would does not stay down now for it to toast. So now we have to hold the lever down for it to toast until they ship me a new unit. I'm apparently responsible for shipping cost of the new unit and the charges to return the old unit back even though it's still under warranty. If it wasn't for the fact that I can't seem to find a toaster that has consistently decent reviews on Amazon, i would have given up on it altogether even if it's still under warranty. It seems so difficult for anyone to make decent toaster that lasts."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this toaster because I thought that it was attractive, had four slots, and I believed that Cuisinart was a reputable brand. Maybe it was, but apparently that is no longer the case. Like some other reviews, I found that the toast was not evenly browned. Worse, after a couple of months, the left side of the toaster no longer toasted both sides on the bread. Only the outside heating element worked in each slot. A few months later, on the other side, the exact same thing happened. It's in the trash now and I am shopping for a new toaster."
1,"It should be called ""A Burner""","Please listen to the negative reviews,I wish I had!!!My dog now eats burnt toast instead of dog bones. One side is nicely browned the other completly burnt. Why oh why didn't I listen,because I'm the consumate optomist believing I would get the one that worked. I urge you DON'T DO IT!!!!"
1,Cuisinart should stick to food processors...,"I bought this toaster because it has a great design and I have always loved my Cuisinart food processor..however, silly me, I made an assumption that the most thing important that a toaster does would be a cinch for this company. Well, I was wrong. Regardless of which slot you put the toast in, the outside of the toast is barely toasted while the inside is very toasted, albeit, unevenly, with the top being moreso than the bottom.Since the design, as it turns out, cannot possibly offset a very poor product, this toaster is going back. As far as the guy who posted that he gets even toasting, I am puzzled as I have tried several different types of bread, whole wheat, bakery and store bought white, with the same results, so he should count himself lucky..."
1,Didn't last long,"It worked for several months, now only one side of the toast gets cooked and it doesn't matter what settings it's on.Very cheap construction for such an expensive toaster."
2,"Looks good, toasts terrible","This is a great looking toaster, but the main thing that a toaster should do, toast, it doesn't. I started out at a four setting and after a number of weeks of trying various settings, I am now down to a one. It is still burning my bread!"
1,Fire Hazard,We received this as a wedding gift. The right side of the toaster didnt work so we exchanged it out for a new one. We received the second on and the right side caught on fire! We had flames coming out of our toaster within 10 seconds of turning it on.Disappointed with this product. We are returning it and getting a different brand.
2,Cuisinart cpt-180,"This was supposed to be the toaster to end all toasters.We had it for about 2.5 years, and now the toast brown on only one side. The outer heating elements still work. The inner elements work at about 1/3 capacity of the outer ones. We now turn our toast around after a couple minutes to cook the other side. Until we find the next toaster to end all toasters. This one was not it!!6/06Sent it back to Cuisinart, to their credit they send us a new replacement, it had the same problem with the inner heating elements.7/06Sent it back to Cuisinart, they were nice and couteous and paid the postage both ways this time. Finally this one works good.I will keep my rating the same because of all the hassle of getting one to toast evenly on all sides."
5,A good purchase!,"I bought this toaster to replace an almost new, expensive toaster that literally fell apart. This toaster matches my color scheme which was one of the reasons I settled on it. Now, I rarely think about that. The toaster performs perfectly. The adjustments make it perform like a will oiled machine and the toast always comes out exactly the way we want it. Ane, I plan on purchasing another one as a Christmas present."
3,"Uneven toast, small slots, fantastic aesthetics","I own most of the Cuisinart line of stainless kitchen appliances (toaster, food processor, blender, coffee grinder, coffee brewer) and of them, this is the only one I'm not very impressed with. There are a few major complaints:1. The slots are not very deep and will not accommodate larger pieces of bread.2. The toast is frequently unevenly toasted. This is especially true on larger pieces of wheat bread.3. Because the exterior is metal, it gets VERY hot and can even burn you if you're not careful.Aesthetically, you'd be hard pressed to find a nicer looking toaster. I love the metal finish that matches my other stainless appliances. If only it worked a bit better, it would be perfect.The description says ""black chrome,"" but the actual color and style is much more of a brushed nickle than chrome. It looks very much like stainless steel.Overall, this is an average toaster with an exceptionally well designed exterior."
2,A two for the look out of the box,"I got the four slice version in chrome at Sam's a couple years ago. Out of the box it was really pretty and matched my other kitchen appliances flawlessly. However, it never evenly browned on both slots right out of the box. two slots worked well and the other slots would brown one side. Two years later and two slots don't work at all, one lever won't stay down at all and the other lever will catch and stay down to start the toasting proccess if you play with it enough. My other problem with this unit, is the chrome finish isn't like my other chrome kitchen products; the finish on this product is sticky and holds onto dust. I wipe down all my appliances twice a month and I have to physically scrub to get this clean everytime, instead of just wiping. I would not recommend this product and it is such a shame, coming from what I have always considered a reputable company."
2,Not reliable,This is the second toaster that has broken within several years. Would buy cheaper unit next time and just replace it frequently.
3,Great look; not durable,"This toaster looks great, to be sure. We received this as a wedding gift, a little over 2 years ago. A few months ago the entire left side stopped toasting. It has something to do with the lever not properly setting itself. Additionally, the elements no longer fully heat up, so there are patches on the bread. I am not really sure what to expect anymore with consumer products, as far as longevity goes, but for the price our friends paid, I would have thought we could have enjoyed more than 20 mos of usage. Back to the toaster drawing board. Can I still get one for free for opening a checking account?"
2,Cuisinart CPT-180,"Very attractive appearing toaster but it doesn't toast evenly. In one instance, the bread wouldn't pop up. I unplugged the toaster and it worked after that. It's ok because I can' find anything better. . Apparently there are no high quality toasters made any more."
4,Nice toaster-Color not as exspected,"Toaster works well and toasts bread and bagels quickly and evenly. I purchased the toaster to match several other red appliances in my kitchen which are bright red. This toaster is actually a darker metalic red, kind of like the color on a classic car, not a matte red like most other red kitchen items."
2,nice looking but uneven toast,"i have to agree with most of the reviews that this toaster does look nice, but as far as toasting goes, it toasts unevenly. not worth the cost."
2,Not Good,It's great if you like your toast with one white side and the other tanned. I can't live with it.
4,Beautiful Toaster,"I know this sounds silly, but I get so many compliments on my toaster. It looks nice on the kitchen counter and works great too. I love that I can eject the bottom to dump out all of the crumbs. But I do wish there was a better way to clean out all of the other crumbs that get stuck on the side. and so many of Cuisinarts other products come with retractable cords; I wish my toaster had one too. Overall, quite happy with this toaster and if it were to break I would probably replace it with the sane one."
4,Good toaster,We've owned the two slice toaster for quite a while and decided to replace with the 4 slice version. I've not experienced any issues so far and it continues to perform just as well as the 2-slice version we used over the years.
5,Great Toaster,This is a great toaster. I really like the defrost feature which helps to make frozen waffles or frozen english muffins crisp up nicely so they are not soggy.
2,Nice looking but not so durable,It looks great on the counter top but it feels very flimsy and one of the levers is beginning to come loose.
2,Poor performer,"I bought this toaster based on its good looks. However, that's where the positive ends. Performance is dreadful - burnt on one side of the bread, whereas underdone on the other side. Very bad. I am currently in contact with Cuisinart Customer Service since I'm very unhappy with this toaster. I'm disappointed since I love the look but hate the toasting results. Best looking toaster I've ever had but at the same time the worst performer!The two stars are given for the attractive casing. Zero stars for performance."
4,Great Toast,"Have had this toaster for about a month and have been loving it - I don't like my toast too dark but still crispy. With this toaster, I am able to get just that. The only downside is that for my raisin bread (slice is smaller than normal bread), you kinda have to ""dig"" it out which i wish there was a way to push it up so i'm not going to risk getting burned although that has not yet happened, i cannot guarantee that it won't in the future."
2,Disappointed: Style over substance,"I'm extremely disappointed in this toaster. It looks great, but unlike the Cuisinart Coffee Maker, this does not meet expectations. Within a couple of years, the toast started toasting on one side. Then last year 2 burners stopped operating completely. A toaster should last at least 10 years. This one lasted two... just long enough for the warranty to be useless. Don't be fooled by its pretty retro look... it's a disappointing toaster."
2,Not worth the money,"I was very dissaponted when I toasted my fisrt slice of bread. One side is toasted and the other side is burnt. If you turn it down, one side is toasted perfect but the other side of the bread is hardly toasted at all. Seems an expensive toasted to have uneven toasting. I'm returning it and continuing to look."
2,Not worth it,"This toaster looks great! but neither slot will brown both sides of toast. I tried it on both fresh and frozen bread with no luck after numerous attempts. Not worth the $60, so I returned it and pulled my cheap plastic toaster out of the closet and got back to having evenly browned toast!"
1,Piece of garbage,"Uneven cooking and fingerprint magnet.Not worth half the price even given it's pleasing appearance. I actually believed for a moment that since it's 120 volts, that my house service wasn't properly giving it power like an electric stove would if you only had 60 amp service.Buy American when it comes to a toaster I guess, cause these idiots haven't figured out how to make one."
1,Not worth the money,The toaster worked great for two years and today decided to go into a permanent bagel mode. The center elements no longer heat. Opened it up and found that under the slick stainless exterior is a cheaply made unit that was not made to last. It was better than the Oster that we had for a few weeks before the mechanism bent but still pretty poorly made.
1,Biiggest piece of s*** toaster of all time!!!,"I did not get this toaster from Amazon, but I have had it for a few years and just sucks!! Burns toast every time."
2,Flawed,"I've had this toaster for a few months now. My main complaint is with the browning control. It is a dial with settings 1-6. Set to anything over 2 results in burned toast,bagel,waffle etc. There are also no detents on the control so it is easy to inadvertantly move the dial resulting in smoking ashes and not toast. This is a toaster that can't reliably produce toast."
1,The worse toaster ever made,Burns one side while leaving the other side raw. This is the 4th bad replacement I have received and they are all bad. Went to WalMart and bought a cheap Black and Decker and it works perfect. Do not buy anything from these jokers.
1,Waste of Money,"This toaster is a complete waste of time and money. Uneven toasting from Day 1, and now one side does not work, less than one year later. The repair person said it is the solenoid that switches on and off when toaster is plugged in. Cuisinart does not even give you the option of returning or repairing on their website. About the only thing about it is it looks decent sitting on the counter - give it a star for that."
2,not that good for the price,"I've had toasters that worked better that were much cheaper. We bought this one for the stainless steel finish and the design, not to mention that it was highly rated, maybe even best rated, by Consumer Reports. But as far as its functionality, it doesn't do that good of a job on toast. We set for toast at setting 2 or 3, don't know how bad it would get if we used one of the higher settings. And like another reviewer said, I can't tell that the bagel setting makes any difference--shouldn't it just toast the cut side of the bagel? Well, it doesn't. One more complaint--slices of wide loaves of bread need to be squeezed in. You'd think an expensive 2-slice toaster would at least accommodate typical bread sizes. We haven't replaced it, but we're not really satisfied customers either. And I'm speaking for my wife too, who is generally more in favor of form over function."
5,cuisinart toaster 4 slice,"This was a gift and the recievers were soooo very excited. They love all the fuctions and the excellant way of toasting... I am very very happy with this product...I rate it a ""love it""Sincerely Ginger"
1,Looks great but toast lousy,This unit looks good on your counter but does not do a good job toasting.My $15 toaster from Walmart did a much better job. I would have retured it but my wife likes the way it looks.
1,"Long term review, call me insane","I have owned this beautiful piece of art for over 5 years. It looks great on the countertop. But as a toaster it fails miserably. As with other reviews, toasts ony one side of bread, regardless of which slot or setting is used. I have become accustomed to turning the bread around after one setting completes and toasting the other side. All elements appear to be working. This toaster has operated like this since I took it from the original packaging.Call me insane for continuing to use this toaster. But at $60, my wife refuses to part with it."
1,Worst Toaster,"I bought this toaster because I have had such good luck with other Cuisinart small appliances. However, this toaster is a year old and already, two walls of elements are entirely burned out. Furthermore, the lever on one side will not always stay down. My toaster only gets used once a day, so there is no reason for this breakage. This was an absolute waste of money--and another cheaply made product that has to go to the garbage dump. Disgusting."
1,waste of money,I expected this toaster to last for years. It started out bad (barely toasts) and has gotten worse (only two slots work). Now that it barely functions I need to begin the search for a decent model.
2,Don't believe Consumer Reports...,"I picked this toaster because Consumer Reports rated the 2-slice at the top of their ratings. I should have heeded the reviews that I read. One side of each pair of slots is always less done - and no, the bagel setting is not on - and if you turn, switch, or try to compensate, the other one is always burned (or cold). Plus, for oblong bread, such as store-bought rye, the slots are not big enough. You have to fold, spindle, or mutilate to get it right. Also, it is silent when the toast is done - easy to forget when you're busy with other things. For the price, this toaster ought to be doing the work, not me. Very disappointing... I am shopping for a replacement."
1,Overpriced Junk,"I received this toaster as a gift and it hasn't worked properly since day one. It doesn't toast each side evenly, or even close to evenly. I usually have to flip the bread to toast the other side, and stand there and watch to make sure it doesn't char it. As other reviewers pointed out, anything over 2 or 3 will torch your bread, at least on one side. The setting dial is kind of worthless since you can find the ""perfect"" setting, and then next time it may come out too dark or to light. I'm not sure why it is so hard to make a toaster that just works. The only good toaster I ever had was a vintage one from the 1950's. Looking at the mixed reviews here, it looks like this toaster is hit or miss... definitely a miss for me."
5,Great source book,"We have several world atlases - this is nearly always the first one we turn to when we want basic maps, facts (population, size, income,...) and a bit of cultural and political history. I hope they soon come out with an updated version as this one is nearly 10 years old (but we still rely on it heavily)."
1,Another ripoff from Studio 99,It isn't Phil Collins. It's another deceptively packaged ripoff from the Studio 99 crud factory.
4,Good collection,"You can get any of these songs on this CD on other Phil CDs like the album, Hits, and a lot of other albums."
5,You Shall Overcome!,"I bought this skinny little book years ago and consider it the self-help book for those of us who aren't ""that"" messed up. Being too hard on myself, demanding too much, had always been a vice. The times I wasn't accomplishing enough, I always felt like I should have been. Overcoming Perfectionism book really helped point out where these feelings came from -- did you know a highly religious upbringing can be ""dysfunctional"" if it makes you feel bad about who you are? I have made a gift of this book to several people and they appreciated making the leap from present activites to their sources. Ann W. Smith's voice is very positive, readable, and the book contains numerous concrete suggestions for change. It helps you see how good life can be once you show yourself the compassion you give to others and cut yourself some slack."
5,Overcoming Perfection Review,This is the first e-book that I read on my Kindle and found it to be very informative. I have been a perfectionest for as long as I can remember and it was good to understand why.Overcoming Perfectionism: The Key to a Balanced Recovery
4,Overcoming perfectionism: The key to balanced recovery,I am obviously struggling with the book as I reread sections to make sure I haven't missed anything! Still fighting that perfect thing.
3,"Good, but needs to be updated!","A lot of useful information, but the book has not been updated in a few years and all of the vintage charts end in 1996. A lot has happened in the world of wines since 1996. Try a book that is updated every year like ""Windows on the World Complete Wine Course: 2003"". I own both books and much prefer Windows on the World."
4,Well organized and great information!!,"After my trip to Paris, and finding out that I thoroughly enjoyed drinking French wine, and at the urging of D'Arcy to discover and enjoy drinking good wine, I have set out to educate myself about wine. This was my first book to tackle. It is well worth reading if you know next to nothing about wine. It is well organized and has a lot of information presented in a great way. I have learned a lot and have discovered some good wine, some great wine, and one really bad Bordeaux!! It is fun and is something that a couple can enjoy together and with friends. If school were this fun I would have gone for a PHD. While not a previous fan of the ""For Dummies"" series, this one is worth reading!!"
2,not as advertized,"the cooler itself is very good,just the right size, and very well build. but it does not come with a food tray as advertized,also the strap on the drain plug was broken."
1,Should allow for negative rating,"What a worthless purchase. I do a lot of travelling and thought this would be great. Sounded wonderful, even sold on the palmone website. Boy was I ever mistaken. Wish I would've gotten the reviews before wasting my money. You can't read the maps, maps are only for a few cities, and the interface is less than user friendly. I finally went with Earthcomber, but when that didn't have directions (just the map and POI, but its all free) I got Mapopolis, which is wonderful. If you want Directions on the Go, rethink it, I suggest Mapopolis. Same price (also a free trial version of ANY map in the US for 9 days) and also has contiguous maps of the entire US with direction capability and POI's!!!!"
1,Warning: Buy at your own risk!!!,"I wouldn't even rate this a '1' because I feel so gipped out of the $35 I spent. I bought this product as a gift for my boyfriend through Amazon a while back-- before there were any reviews about this product. I have to agree with all of the previous reviews. Unless you live in a major metropolitan area, this product is completely useless. I thought that this would be a good alternative for him instead of going to Mapquest on his phone. Now, he just winds up using mapquest anyways. If you need directions to and from the city, 'Directions on the Go' works fine, but if you need to travel from the city to the suburbs or vice versa, you're out of luck.He never even uses this product anymore... Poor gift choice on my part."
1,"Very, very unhappy","I am NOT happy with this product. They don't even have the major cities in my state, let alone the city I live in. When I emailed them about it, they said they were updating the cities but mine was not on the list and they didn't know when it would be. I'm definitely getting my $40 bucks back and never buying their products again!"
1,Don't buy this...,"The Maxell P-12 Dual auto Power Adapter is a piece of junk, so, please, if you value your money at all - do not buy! This unit did not work at all and the dual adapters have little caps to prevent debris from getting into the unit (I'm asuming this), and the caps immediately became wedged deep in the unit making it impossible to plug anything into the adapters. I guess the question to Maxell is - why manufacture anything that doesn't work? And the seller? Why sell it?"
5,Best Yet,"I love this product. My lips were so dry and flaky and since using this, they are now soft and no flakes. Lasts a long time and great bargain."
2,Ok story -- horrible editing,"I liked the premise of the story and thought this would be a nice way to kill some time. Unfortunately, the editing in this book is non-existent. I've never read a book and been so distracted by typos. Not just here and there -- everywhere! Odd typos, too, like the number 1 used instead of I, or two 00s instead of the letter o.If you can get past the typos on every page, the story is okay. Shannon is annoying and weak, but this isn't unusual in many romance books. This book took me several weeks to finish because the only thing unpredictable about it was what new errors I would find on the next page."
4,wife loved it,My wife absolutely loved it. She looked all around and was surprised that I found a pink running watch with all these features. For the money it's a great watch.
3,Pretty but frustrating,"I was really happy to find more of a feminine looking pedometer watch in this. The thinner band and pink color is nice. However, I mainly purchased this to count my daily steps, see how many miles I ""stepped"" and how many calories I burned. The frustrating feature is that it constantly shuts itself off from counting the steps if you are not moving for a certain period of time. You have to always be thinking of checking it and turning it back on. It's not working for me in that respect. I am unable to see a full day's computation of steps. I had another watch pedometer that did that beautifully except it was big and clunky and only came in black. If this brand could change this feature, it would be perfect for my purposes."
1,Walking Great / Running Not,"I got this watch to help me decrease my times for 5k, and it defiantly not 95% accurate. I run ~10-11 minute mile; yet, both on the treadmill and outside, this watch was reading ~7.5 to 8 minute mile. Distance was also off by +20%, when running.Speed and distance ~98% accurate for walking 15 min/mile."
3,Complicated pedometer watch - good for running,"This watch is very complicated to set up and learn how to use. I read the whole manual before figuring it out (even though I'm usually very good with technology). Just not very intuitive. The manual tells you to go to the tech4o website to figure out the stride settings; however, there is no obvious information on the website. The biggest disappointment with this watch is that it's only about 80% accurate for walking (underestimates the number of steps you take). Nevertheless, it's about 98% accurate for running, which I was I bought it for. The pink color is a little brighter than I would have liked."
4,Tech 4 watch,"The watch is hard to figure out at first but I did call the customer service desk and they were able to help me work it... The lady was very helpful and knew exactly what she was talking about it. The distance is a little off, but it still gives me an idea of how far I ran. It's not a 100% accurate so it's suppose to be a little off. I like this watch and am glad I bought it."
4,Tech 4.0 Accelerator Running Watch,"The item was purchased as a gift for my wife. Note, take time to review the provided manual which is well written and accurate. I tested the watch while on my treadmill as a comparison against the speed and miles from the treadmill computer. The device was highly accurate noting my total miles and speed varied minutely against the treadmill readout. The device was easy to set up and use. However as noted per other reviewers, you must take time to read the manual. I will be purchasing a men's version of this watch for myself. Great Product!"
1,this watch is a useless piece of junk,"this watch is good for one thing - telling time. i have measured and correctly entered my stride lengths, it does not work. i have called tech 4o customer service 4 times. they were very nice, but of zero help to me. i have tried everything in the 3 months that i gave this watch a fair shot to make it work out. it does not read accurate distances, period. every time i run the same verified 4 mile loop, i get a different distance reading. it was a waste of $55. i'm very very disappointed."
1,Tech 4 O Accelerator Women's Running Watch,"This is a pretty watch to put on your arm while walking. However, I bought it in April to use while I walked for medical reasons to know how far I am walking. I have yet been able to figure out how to use it. My husband finally got the clock set on it, but I can't figure out how to get to where I want it to start counting my steps and everything on the watch is either too small or to washed out to read to know what buttons you are pushing. For me, this was a waste of my money."
5,Fun!,"Getting the kids to be excited about learning match can be a challenge, but my daughter really enjoys these. They're easy to use, and allow her to check her own work. Brilliant concept!"
1,Shallow and content free,"This book completely misses out on the important ideas. It goes in painful detail through whether to use glue, sticky tape, pins or post-it notes to stick paper to to a wall, but fails to explain how to think of what to write on the paper. Each chapter ventures towards an important topic, then misses it. Each example is unrealistic.Where you might think that senior project managers would have to deal mainly with human issues rather than technical ones, this book has only half a page on getting to know the project team, and suggests that people will be sufficiently motivated by seeing someone in the canteen using project merchandise like a pen.I didn't find anything 'advanced' here."
5,great read for my 8 year old,Our 8 year old loved this book. The comic format is brillantly done. I would recommend for any kid 8-10 who loves science.
5,Good story plus good information,"This is an excellent comic. Jay Hosler does a good job of explaining the lives of bees in an entertaining fashion. The illustrations are clear and do a good job of conveying the story. Also included are a short bibliography and five pages briefly providing more information about bees. I eagerly ordered this book for our library and haven't regretted it. Although the amount of information on bees is most appropriate for children, this is a story that may be enjoyed by all ages."
1,"strBook = ""load_of_crap""","Out of the dozen or 15 Wrox Press books we have at the office, this one is the only one I regret buying. If you own any other Wrox Press ASP books, DON'T BUY THIS ONE -- IT'S REDUNDANT to the nth degree! Truly, if you own ANY ASP books, or have any ASP experience, whatsoever, this book's probably not worth your money."
4,Good Starting Point for Beginners and Professionals,"An excellent book. It gives practical alternatives to the more tricky ASP coding. However, after it all, you feel as if the author is holding back. Maybe for a sequel perhaps."
4,"One of the best, from the best","I would love to give this book 5 stars; I would really love to. It has a bunch of real world examples that blow away the other books. It also deals with code, including the thought process behind it. But there is not enough of the why to satisfy my curiosity.As a professional webmaster, I am looking for ways to take my apps to the next level. This book starts to give me some ways to optimize, and then drops me off short of the goal line. I was hoping this site would deal with optimization of code, a serious concern for the professional web developer, esp. in the light of how easily people are getting bored on the web today.Now that I got my digs in. Here is what you do receive. ADO, cross platform scripting, controls, real world site logs...and much more. The real world aspect and code heavy nature makes it a perfect learning tool for the intermediate to advanced ASP developer. This is definitely not a book for newbies to Visual InterDev and Active Server Pages."
5,Great Book,I love this book. I enjoy traveling and eating at new and different places. This book was enjoyable to read and informative.Rachael Ray has so much energy it is fun to watch her show. Reading the book puts you right there even if you can't travel to each town.I recommend this book to everyone looking for new a varied tastes in eating enjoyment.
4,Rachael's Finest,This is the best of the Rachael Ray Books. It is fully illustrated with helpful hints that are updated and accurate. The pictures were divine. Also this will make anyone travel-savvy. Good job Rachael.
2,"A passable companion for the series, but still...","Enough, enough, ENOUGH already with the Ray Ray. I'm not really sure why this book exists other than to milk the RR cash cow. Her 30 Minute Meal books are getting repetitive, and this looks like it was dashed off in a couple of weeks.I feel bad for the businesses where RR says what she ordered was ""not her favorite"" or something similar. What a snot. I'd be PISSED if I owned the Crack'd Conch. I think she's forgetting how lucky she is to be doing what she's doing.Bottom line, if you're as agog with RR's cuteness as she is, pick the book up. Lots of pics!"
5,"Steel Door Magnetic Weatherstrip, 36-by-81 Inches, Beige",This is exactly what I needed for my steel door! Easy to install and fits great! I would recommend this product to anyone!
3,"Good, inexpensive product, needs stronger magnet","This M-D Building Products 1610 Steel Door Magnetic Weatherstrip, 36-by-81 Inches, Beige had a good fit, went in/on very easily, and did the trick. I just wish it had a stronger magnet in it like one of my other doors has."
4,yep,"As others said magnetic on one side and compression on the other, an exact match for what was on my Stanley door right down to the color. I would prefer magnetic on both sides, but this being Southern California it's not really necessary. My original was nailed in but I didn't bother as it held in just fine without nailing(I don't know why it'd need nails anyway)"
3,Magnets not very strong,"After reading several reviews I decided to give this weatherstrip a try. I loved the idea of the magnets forcing the weatherstrip seal to conform to the door, but I found in its application the magnets were not strong enough to seal anything. I have a stanley steel entry door and this product left larger gaps then the existing weatherstrip it replaced because the magnets are not strong enough to actually stick to the door.Perhaps the type of door makers a difference, but I had no luck."
4,Excellent replacement or new installation,I recently ordered this item to replace my worn and rotting weatherstrip.I had previously purchased a foam product from a local hardware store. Upon reading reviews I promptly took that back and came here to order this item.Cheaper than the stores and shipping was fast.Installation takes a few minutes and no screws are needed.After about 2 months it is still in place and I see no signs of wear.4/5 stars because the inside strip is a bit bulky and made the door shut extremely tight. I know this makes a better seal and I am sure this will wear in over time. It was just annoyingly hard to shut the front door at first.
3,Not Sure it helps,"I haven't seen much of a difference, between these magnetic strips and the one that came with the doors. I live in a very windy area and these just don't help us. I wish there was a better cheaper way to get good weather stripping. But I haven't found one. Bottom line I would not recommend these."
2,Good product; pricing not great,"Product works, though I wish the magnet was stronger.Really disappointed however, when I was walking through a big box hardware store (rhymes with grow) a week after ordering this and seeing it sold for $9 less than the $28 I paid for it. I generally found Amazon's pricing pretty competitive, but I'm going to have to rethink that based on my most recent experience."
1,"Paif for magnetic, didn't get what I paid for, 2, top and lock side magnetic, hinge side unacceptable, compression type","poor, it made me put one star bvefore it would accept my review, waste of a star."
3,steel door weatherstrip,"Just like the strip that came on the door. The magnet isnt as strong, they really need to improve that. I had to put some foam stripping on so the door would have a good seal otherwise the magnet wouldnt grab the door."
4,Worked great on my steels doors/,Came in a long package. Cut to fit with some snips. Was a perfect fit replacment and sealed door much better than mu old compression weatherstipping.
3,Arrived on time but I have not yet installed it.,Have not yet installed it. It was for our hunting camp and we closed it and are heading south now. Will get to it in May.
2,Not good,"Was not what was advertised. Had to modify it to fit doorPicture showed the product like I thought it would be, but it was not like that"
5,magnetic seal for old Stanley steal doors,"I searched the internet to find a magnetic seal for a 22yr-old Stanley steal door. I finaly found, on one of the comparison sites. a listing for Lowe's. Low and behold Lowe's has the M-D 1610 magnetic seal kits in stock at their stores. The price is less than $20. It has all three peices required to do the replacement. Hope this is helpfull."
1,Do not recommend this!,"This hole punch barely does 5 pages at a time, and it's actually difficult to insert the pages into the slots. I had to look carefully every time I put paper in to make sure the sheets were fully in. Also, the first few times I used it, the hole punch would miss the middle hole and only the top and bottom would be punched. I had an old hole punch that was so easy to use. Sadly I lost that one, so thought this would be a good substitute - I was wrong! I'm surprised there are 20 5-star reviews. Btw, I am a grad student and have used a hole punch a lot in my lifetime, and this one was terrible!"
3,You want some holes? :),Does the job. Get this if you want a cheap hole puncher. needed it for sheet music which doesn't have holes so i can put music in binder.
2,Not for me,It's a little too hard for me to push down. I think it works fine but I am elderly and don't have the push power that I used to have.
3,It's a basic 3-hole punch. It's not even anything more.,"Some people are very easy to impress. This is a very basic three-hole punch. It's not pretty. It doesn't punch more than 7-8 pages with considerable effort. It's hard to reconfigure for anything other that a simple three hole punch. It's not inexpensive. I honestly don't get people's love affair with the most basic office supply. It is what it is. I bought it on Amazon because I live in a rather rural area and shopping is just easier on Amazon. If I had made a trip to Office Depot or even Walmart, I'm sure I'd find a similiar product at a similiar price."
4,A little narrow,"Seems a little narrow; I don't think it would easily take 10 sheets of paper. Otherwise it works fine, so it is what it is. And the price is right.S.P. Richards Company Adjustable 3 Hole Punch, Adjustable, 1/4"" Size, 8-10 Sheet Capacity, BK (SPR00786)"
1,Good thing it was so cheap,This product punches fine except the holes punched are at the end of the paper and when put in a binder they end up getting torn as they are too close to the edge. I also tried the Swingline and that did the same thing. I would not recommend this product nor Swingline at all.
5,Flamenco at it's best,I love this cd. The sounds are brilliant and vibrant. It's great to listen to while I'm tooling around the house on a warm sunny day with the windows open and there is a warm breeze. It's like sunshine.
5,Now it can be told!,"All-in-all, it's quite an interesting book. I think the thing that struck me the most was realizing how little I really knew about the early history of the band. I mean, being a longtime fan of the band, sure I knew the major things (i.e, forming at Kent State, Jerry witnessing the shootings there, etc), but I never really had a grasp on how Bob Lewis played into the picture, or just when Jim left the band, or how Alan got the job. And I'd never really heard much about the Gorj character, either. That's not to say it's a book merely for hardcore Devo fans. I think that anyone with an interest in the band or the 70's punk/new wave scene in general will enjoy the book."
4,Duty Now more than ever,"The authurs are very opinionated and they simply stop writing about what happened in the Devo story after the 3rd album. As a fan of Devo's Freedom of Choice era I find it sad the book ends when the bands success takes off and skims over the troubles with Warner Brothers, making the videos, downfall and Re-Evolution into TV and movie soundtracks at Mutato Muzika. There is a lot of information by former friends who have an ax to grind. Having said that there is a lot to learn about the early hardcore Devo recordings and the philosophy behind the band. Recomended until a documentary or better band history comes along."
3,Raed the last 2/3,"The book is divided up in three sections: Head, Body, and Tail. The ""head"" section was very boring and hard to read. I put the book down for about 6 months, trying to get through this section. Once I got to ""body"" and ""tail,"" the book flew. I found it very interesting, being a Devo fan from when I first saw them on Sat. Night Live, through New Traditionalists. Being from the Cleveland/Akron area, I also liked all the local references."
3,Duty Then for Your Future!,"I was REALLY looking forward to this Book. The First of its Kind. It started with all the Rich details that Good books have BUT It went a little Too in depth about the Pre Stardom DEVO history & Very Little about the Post Hit Devo times! I was left Wanting of some Vital insights about some aspects of the Music, Friendships, and The Times when They were at the Peak. Jerry Casale comes off like a Demonized Control Freak, while Mark is shown as A Great Genius (he is) but one who has No concept of the Real World! The total opposite of Who I think he is. He understands the World So much better that we are lead to believe. Then The book is Over! Splat! Career Over, Fun times Over! Worth Reading, but worth re-writing too!"
4,Quit knitpicking and buy this book - Real fans will agree,"I enjoyed this book because it contained great details of the actual history of this unique group of entertainment twisters. Some complain about its lack of depth AFTER ""hitting it big"" - But that is the EASY info that gets lost in the shuffel of jumping through corporate hoops. No, this book dives into the background, well before the groundbreaking '74-'77 sessions were recorded, and years before the world heard of ""Whip It"". The flukes that happened to aid their creative visions, along with the surprising names that dropped into their career, made for more of an information-heavy read than I thought I would get! The group themselves need to write their own book - but they haven't yet - So get this, the first one. I've heard the band isn't completely happy this book is out, as it isn't all praise and buttkissing. I'd give it 4 energy domes."
4,The early years in depth,"We Are Devo is a great read. Everything from 1971 through the release of the first LP is covered in detail. The first 190 pages are a captivating snapshot of the evolution of devolution.I do feel the need to detract 1 star for only having 40 pages devoted to years 1979 to 2002. I realize that 'not too much' happened in the later years, but the coverage is a bit too non-existent.Recommended!"
4,Very helpful guide to Oregon,"Great to have so many campgrounds at your fingertips. We enjoyed the style of writing and the content. The photos helped us remember which places we had already been. Would be perfect for the tent camper. Since we are hauling a long travel trailer it would have been more helpful if it had listed the length of the campsites and if the road to get to the site were appropriate for hauling a trailer. Overall, we are happy to have this as part of out library."
1,Disappointment,"Readers would be advised to buy a map of Oregon and explore campsites on their own rather than buy this overpriced book.The author at times tries for a latter day version of Travels with Charley, but doesn't pull it off. The editors of this guide allowed too many pictures which are either irrelevent to the reader or are unfocussed."
4,ITS Finally ON CD!!,"For the longest time,I have had to hold onto my record I bought back in the 90s waiting for a cd release of this album.Was considering shelling out big paper to have it professionally made into a cd,but my patience has paid off at last.Love Has Come Around is the most popular song from Donald Byrd's 125 th Street faze of his career,but the entire album is worth checking out."
5,Love It!,This vanity is wonderful. It is easy to assemble and functions well. I love the second shelf to store items on as well. Absolutely love this item.
5,Great sandal!,I just purchased this sandal and it's just fabulous. The shoe is very light and comfortable. It's a great purchase.
1,Waste of Money $$,"My Instructor told me not to waste my time or money on this book, but I did not listen. He was correct. A book to help a martial artist better understand mind-set was written by Forrest Morgan, Living the Martial Way. Buy that book instead of wasting your $$$ and time on this book."
1,NO GOOD,"Highly overated, and fails to discuss in detail the ""Mindset of a Martial Artist"". All the reviews on this site must be from students or friends of Clerc. They certainly are not objective enlightened readers. Nice title, other than that not much else."
5,FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY,"Books like ""The Mindset of a Martial Artist"" are enjoyable to read. It covers alot of essentials that students who are beginners to the martial arts ought to know about. Advanced students will also benefit because the training tips are very practical.The beginning and the end are my favorite parts. These sections cover the limitations associated with rote learning and the benefits associated with adapting to situations as they arise. Details are given about how to read another person's body language. The latter part of the book talks about the personal transformation that the author has experienced during his involvement in the martial arts.Hope I haven't given too much away. This is a really good book and the movies nicely compliment the book. Five stars is justly deserved."
4,A WELL WRITTEN BOOK,"This is a very good book. It's well written and worth reading more than once. The exercises are practical and the reading insightful, especially the latter parts of the book. It's only fault is that it left me wanting to know more. Maybe that was Mr. Clerc's intent. Overall, a really nice, well-written book."
1,"ICP'S ""DEATH RACERS"" SUCKED!!!","this movie was horrible the only good thing was the background music (and yes its manly ICP and/or Psychopathic Records related type of music),please don't waste your money on this piece of low budget garbage movie just watch it on Netflix like i did!!!by the way i am an ICP/Psychopathic Records fan but come on this was straight up garbage only a true loyal ""ICP4LIFE "" fan (I.E juggalo and/or juggalette) would like & buy this junk movie!!!"
3,Not exactly what you expect...,"For starters this movie is poorly filmed and edited. If you're excited about the gory scenes, don't be. They only show something happening about 3 times during the movie otherwise they just turn the camera away and you are forced to use your imagination. The story is pretty interesting and would be better if some more money had been put into it. You constantly have to turn the volume up and down to understand what people are saying especially during scenes in the mayor's office. I also noticed that a number of the driving scenes of hitting people and running them over were the same exact frames! I was like, is this deja vu or are they really just plugging the same scenes back in later in the movie. So I rewound and found that they were certainly the same frame.Bottom line: If you're looking for a quality movie this definitely is not one. If you want a movie that you can watch and laugh at while you get drunk or something then go nuts. It's only 5 bucks."
1,"Another Asylum ""parody""","With a home video camera and a five dollar budget Asylum makes another attempt to cash in on a new movie, in this case Death Race. If you value your money you'll stay away. Asylum is another word for garbage."
1,CRAP!!!!!,"Pure crap!!!! Its possible this movie was produced by a porn director....low budget, with no acting talent what so ever. Insane clown posse cant sing let alone act. What were these dopes thinking? Rented this movie from redbox and it was a waste of one dollar. I would rather have listened to Barry Manilow than watch this waste(Had I known). If it were possible I would have given it a negative star."
5,Entrega Rapida,Elegí la clasificación porque el producto llego en buen estado y la entrega fue entre el tiempo estimado. El perfume fue para un regalo. Saludos
1,Horrible!,"I hated the way this stuff smelled, I had recently purchased the Paris Hilton ""tease"" and I enjoyed it. I then decided to try this one due to friends claiming it was nice. I recommend you try the scent out at a department store or wherever it's available before purchasing it. It has a weird kind of fruity smell, I can't really describe."
5,Excelent perfume!,"I was a little wary about buying a Paris Hilton fragance, since now celebs put their names on anything. But my daughter insisted on this perfume, and it's really good! It's sweet buy not in a bubblegum-candy sort of way. If you are in your 20s-30s and like sweet scents, this one's worth a try."
5,A-Mazing Scent!,"The fragrance is light without being too overbearing though can get overbearing if too much is spritzed. I am getting hints of honeysuckle and this is a nice scent to add to any perfume. Honeysuckle is a fragrance I would actually use in the summer but this fragrance makes it okay for colder weather as well. This perfume is not overly musky, which can be irritating if too strong. I am glad I got this and will make sure to try more of her fragrances!What's in this Fragrance?Top Notes:Passion Fruit, Orange, Peach Granita, Champagne MimosaMiddle Notes:Star Jasmine, Tiare Flower, Ylang-Ylang, Honeysuckle, Dewberry Blossom, GrenadineBase Notes:Violet Leaf, Vetiver, Tonka, Blonde Woods"
3,Was not too impress...,"I love the way it smells but I couldnt score it higher than a 3 because the scent/aroma fades after only about an hour or so... But either than that good purchase if your looking for a girly, flowerly scent."
3,Nothing new,"This is an o.k. DVD,I mean there isn't any rare footage.all his videos are included( which we have seen so many time)but no Live perfomaces. I gave it 3 star becuase of the sound quality is good on the videos.Juanes need to come out with a LIVE DVD for his fan to capture the essence of his talent.Tino"
1,Que Asco !,"Que Porqueria de DVD, definitivamente perdi el dinero que gaste en esto, es un a boleta pense que por er juanes iba a encontar algo de calidad por lo visto me equivoque, jusnes en la musica es bueno pero los videos de el son un asco."
3,Interesting,"As a seeker of truth, I had hoped for some illumination on the spiritual truths. The different authors are all over the scale with their beliefs....making clear only the limitations of science and human intellect."
1,It's all a matter of faith,"It always amazes me how seemingly intelligent people can become so irrational when it comes to their religious beliefs. This feeble attempt to show how new theories in science point to a God is nothing new. Ontological and cosmological ""proofs"" for God have been around for a long time and this book offers nothing new. I have a PhD in physics and have met many other scientists and have shared thoughts on this subject. I must say the editors and sample scientists views are NOT representative of most. It seems obvious the editors picked those scientists who held similar views. Sure they chose a few token agnostics. The only way I could recommed this book is for a laugh and the simple wonder of how the comfort of religion can corrupt even a well disciplined scientific mind."
2,Battery eater!,Has a strong wind but the batteries die quickly. Buy rechargeable batteries and you will be okay.
5,"Heartfelt, hard-hitting, and eye-opening","I was thrilled to learn about the publication of this book, as I have been in awe of Billie Jean Young's talents since first hearing her speak in the late '70s. I very much enjoy and appreciate the soul-baring prose in this book -- so much so that I have purchased a copy to donate to our local library. I find it especially eye-opening for those of us with the ""privilege"" of white skin, who have much to gain by better understanding the issues facing women of African American descent. I especially like her searing and sometimes gut-wrenching poems in Part 1. The excellent preface and introduction put her writings in context and give us greater insight into the ""why"" of her writings. It is definitely worth reading -- and reading again."
5,An Extraordinary Work of Art,"In this book, we not only learn about the life and times of Billie Jean Young, but also of ourselves. This work has the universality that only a classic would contain. She does not write for just one race, one sex, or one identity. In this piece of literature, we can all see a little of ourselves in sometimes positive and sometimes negative perspectives.At the end of the poetry section there is the inclusion of her two act play ""Fannie Lou Hamer: This Little Light..."" which is transforming in its description of historical events. It is as if you can hear the low treble of Fannie Lou's voice coming off the pages when you read these prose. To accentuate the prose it is written in the southern twang that is elemental to understanding the Mississippi condition and persona.This book is a definite must read for poets and anyone thinking of creating a historical drama."
5,My daughter loves these CD's!,"My daughter loves both the first Mommy & Me and Mommy & Me More. We can't go through a day without watching one of them. The segments in between are a bit goofy, but the songs are fun and it gets my girl up and moving. When I first tried these on her around 14 months, she could care less, but now at 2 years, she loves them!"
3,Mommy & Me,This DVD is almost the same thing as the other mommy and me.Same songs and some actors with few changes...But it is good asIt was the other one.
4,Grandson loved this,"He is within the autism spectrum, loves videos, and let's face it...any concept of keeping close and loving with Mom or any family member is probably worth more than this price. Joy in an otherwise depressing and worrisome outlook."
3,It is ok. The kids like it.,"It does ""blip"" a few times while playing but it is ok. The kids still enjoy all of their favorite songs and the characters."
5,The best family vegetarian cookbook I've read!,"I've been a vegetarian for over eight years. I now have 2 children, and it's been a struggle to find recipes that they will eat. This is the book I've been looking for! It is a realistic approach to feeding a family vegetarian-style meals without breaking your pocket book or using weird ingredients that you can never find at your local grocery store. I've tried several recipes from this book so far, and all have been winners. The only caution I would give is that some of the foods seem a little high-fat to me, but there is not a nutritional count done for each recipes, as I have seen in some other cookbooks. But that's the only complaint I have--overall, it's my favorite cookbook right now!"
4,"Good book, but disappointed","I bought this book based on the reviews I read. Lots of the recipes sound delicious and it has readily available ingredients. However, I am a simple cook, don't like a lot of ingredients or things that take a lot of prep. Most of these recipes have many, many ingredients. I am keeping it and I will use a few recipes, but it won't end up being a favorite go-to book. I am disappointed because it sounded so good in the reviews!"
4,Food for the body and the mind,"I found this book at my public library and loved it so much that I had to have my own copy. In response to a previous reviewer, Mr. Haerdrich (a vegetarian himself) and his wife (also a vegetarian) have raised their children as vegetarians. This is all noted in his introduction. I am excited to take the advice of such an expert and to share the wonderful results with my family."
5,excellent cookbook,We bought this book to get some ideas for healthy meals for my vegetarian step-daughter and it turns out the whole family loves it. We've made lots of different main and side dishes from the book and they're a big hit all around.
3,So-so.,"""One for My Baby"" written by Tony Parsons centers around Alfie, an English as Second Language instructor who has to deal with the tragic loss of his wife, Rose. Alfie returned to Britain after residing with Rose in Hong Kong for several years. Without Rose, Alfie never seem to fit in and frequently wallowed in self-pity. On top of that, his family was torn apart when Alfie's father left his wife for a younger woman.I read ""One for My Baby"" after reading ""Man and Boy"" which I was very impressed. I didn't enjoy ""One for My Baby"" because I feel that the story seems to drag itself. At times, the main character Alfie seems to be forever wallowing in self-pity and after 50 pages or so, it can get tiring. Regardless of that, the Tony Parsons's writing is still remarkable and he has the ability to make his readers identify with his characters."
3,Not for me this time,"Like other readers I was a little disappointed by this. It had much of the formula used in Man and Boy - the emotion, the humour, the eastern flavour. But it did nothing for me. I found it hard to get close to any of the characters. It deals with the difficult subject of loss - but never quite gets there. In fact it began to get on my nerves after a while.Having said all that I still read in two days. It isn't boring. Maybe it just isn't a holiday read."
3,"not bad, not bad",Good story line althought I found it a little hard to dive into at first. It was a boring start. Worth the read in the end.
2,Good writer with a poor story.,This is a well written book with a poor story. I got the Chinese translation edition and enjoyed reading it at one setting. The character seemed to be thinking too much of himself and did not realize the fact he was taking advantage of the student and teacher relationship to sleep with his students. I just don't see how one can love another person so much and still behave like an teenager. Too much self-pity and self-justify irresponsible sex acts and the confession of his best friend just made the perfect wife picture looked ugly. This has to be a man's fantasy of love story. I think it is a unrelistic self-portrait of the author himself.
2,Meh...,This book is horribly repetitive. The main character isn't very likable and is distractingly inconsistent in his thoughts and actions. And a cleaning lady who wears hooker clothes and stilettos to work is just ridiculous.All in all it's just a mess.
3,Fairouz,"This is a good CD. Ziad Rahbani (Fairouz's son) is an excellent songwriter. I enjoy his intrumental pieces. Fairouz has a great voice. My favorite song is 'Li bayrut', but altogether the whole thing is pretty good. I also recommend her Christmas CDs and her son's 'Kyrie Eleison'."
4,"A great, strong-holding clutch.","This clutch holds up well to my 590HP big block, against 40"" boggers. I broke the last one of these clutches I had, because I broke some of the bolts holding the bell housing in place, but that's what it took to break it. It is still a smooth catching ride, and actually seems easier on the leg (with the mechanical clutch in the truck) than the OEM clutch did."
5,NOT ONE OF HIS BEST,This one wasn't as good as some of the others I have read. I agree with the person who rated this book a 2. The ending was really bad
1,Not Scary,This story did have a twist to the end but it was corny and made me wonder why I read the book in the first place. The end really messes the story up...
2,Where is the Horror? What happened to R.l Stine?,"I have to admit that R.L Stine is my favorite auother because of his horror, but this book of his wasn't very good. Its just about a guy named bobby who starts dating the wade twins. This book is just love, no horror at all, Booby just thinks theres horror. The most intese scary part for was the DRIVING! I really haven't finished this book because so dull for R.L. Stine. So readers out there, if you wan't horror from R.L. Stine, don't get it from this book!"
1,"Anna says , ""Don't read this.""","In the beginning of the book, I thought it was a total bore. Bobby, one of the main characters, always said the same things over and over again. And his thoughts were always the same too. So it felt like I was reading the book in circles. Only the two last chapters I thought were interesting.Bobby always gets all of the girls. Including the Wade twins, wild Samantha, and shy Bree. When both the Wade twins fall for him, he decides to go out with both of them behind each others backs. But people keep telling Bobby that they are dangerous, but when he doesn't listen the, Wade twins take him for a ride.I don't think anyone will like this book, unless you love boring books, which no one does."
4,imangtive and creative,"it's a really cool book,and it has an important moral,watever bad thing u do,it'll com back and bite u in da a$$,da coke think was kind stupid though,then again,i guess not,theres 1 thing this book had tat none others had,beliveble charcthers,it has a kinda weak plot,wat he does is risky,and there stupid not 2 nocited,but then again the endind explains all.it is higly onrignalreccomened to all"
3,"okay, but not one of the best","r.l. stine is a wonderful writer...my favorite. i have read many of his books, all of them fear street. i love the plot twists and the twisted endings. yet this book's ending is kind of lame, there is still much that it does not explain. and just the plot of the book is kind of predictable...i had pretty much figured out the end before i got there. if you want to read a book with a better plot and ending, i would reccomend some of R.L. Stine's other books, such as the face, wrong number 1 & 2, secret admirer, etc. this book just really lacked alot of the qualities that i usually expect from r.l. stine."
1,This book is good if you don't read the ending,"I don't think this is the greatest book that was written from R.L.Stine. The title was very interesting. And yes, I was very, extremely interested in the beginning and the middle of the story. But I got a bit confused of what had happened near the end. And the ending (I've to admit)was tooooo suprisingly bad! I can't believe it! I can't believe such a good story would be destroyed entirely because of the ending. So I would recommend you to read this book but don't read the ending cuz you will definitely be disappointed."
3,"corny, man that was corny!!!!!!","if u read this book, i think that u'll think it's corny also. it's not scary, it's corny, dumb, confusing, and pointless. all of stine's boox r really good, except this 1. it was sooo corny. (sorry if i said corny 2 much)."
5,It's a terrific book with thrills & unexpected twists,"If it's horror you want, it's horror you'll get with the book Double Date. The author of this book, RL Stine, knows exactly what the readers want, horror. This book is about three high school students, the Wade twins Bree and Samantha, and the school date-machine Bobby. Bobby meets the twins at school and suddenly, everything changes. He asks them both out, but doesn't realize what he got himself into. I liked how Samantha & Bree handled Bobby because it seemed as if it was the right thing to do.The setting of this story is good because it is a place most people can relate to, high school. If the story didn't take place in the school it wouldn't have been as realistic. Other places the story takes place in are a mall and dance club. I liked these settings because most people can relate to them. This book is a must-read. Go get a copy today. Trust me, you'll get so involved you won't want to put this book down."
4,Exciting yet lacks a good ending,"This was the first Fear Street book I read. When I read a couple of others, I realized there was something missing in this one: a good ending. but i still rate it 4 stars since it's really intense in all the other parts of the book.so basically, the book is about Bobby Newkirk, the guy that thinks he's like a God's gift to women. His friend dares him to date both of the Wade twins-Bree and Samantha-who recently moved to Shadyside.The Wade twins look the same, but act completely different. While Bree is quiet and shy, Samantha is bold and daring. And they will put Bobby through a lot of trouble.I like the concept of twins and all the mystery in the book. I like all of it except for the ending. well the ending is quite fun, but it doesn't have a shocking value all the other Fear Street books have."
2,Two thumbs down,"This wasn't one of R.L.'s best books. The results were pathetic. You already knew the ending, and it wasn't even scary! Keep writing R.L.!"
4,good start,"His explanations and examples are clear and easy to understand, although you do need to have knowledge on Java language itself.I like the structure, but as others pointed out, it does focus strongly to the MIDP protocol and there is more to J2ME.Looking through the other books I found this the best to get started with J2ME and definitely worth to have it sitting in your shelf when you progam."
2,Nothing new...,"The book is supposedly new, published 2005 but it really didn't provide anything new regarding J2ME. I was hoping to learn new things by buying this book. I'm quite disappointed with my purchase."
1,Please Buy The PA Version,Why do they even include the edited version in amazon? It ruines the WHOLE cd when it's edited. Buy the PA version.
1,great cd but get the PA version,this is a horrible edited cd and ruins the whole music sepecially yall want a single buy the regular version
2,BOO!,"I got this as a gift from a friend and unfortunately they gave me the clean version. Like my favorite song on this cd is ya'll want a single, but i hate listening to it on this cd. They bleep out about every word so it sounds like J.D is just screaming jibberish. The only really good song on this cd is Did My Time which can be heard on the new tomb raider movie. Next time i hope one of my friends gives me the real version cause this one is just crap!"
5,Empires of the Mind,"Reading twice in row , I finally had to put aside but not it's Philosphy ..Waitley's ""Empires of the Mind."" a revolutionary book so persuasive and convincing , unfolds the secret of reinventing oneself to thrive and deliver in the dynamically challenging enviornment , where Change is the Rule, Risk a Relegion and empowerment a pulse you better start sleeping with this book if you need to be awakened !!"
4,A good entry into a sometimes difficult subject,"This book is a good read for people who are technical, but not information security experts. I see from Amazon that there are other books in the series; I will definitely be reading them soon.It is a fictionalized account of people (on both sides of the enforcement/criminal side) who are dealing with identity theft and forgery. I would recommend that anyone who has questions about identity theft gives this book a look - it's definitely opened my eyes.The technical sections are useful illustrations for those who understand them, but the main thrust of the book is in the concepts applied. Anyone who does not understand the details of the technical approaches would still be able to understand the plot movement and basic areas where they may want to bolster their own identity security."
1,Wrong author,This book is listed as Babette Cole as the author. I ordered the book. The author of this book is Brenda Cole. It is not a Children's book.
4,gopher1010,This was the second one I have orderd. First one lasted 1-1/2 years and water corroded the middle of the wire. They are easy to install with A screwdriver and A little time. But I had thought the unexposed /unopen to weather conectors would have lasted longer. Still like it over cutting in my own wires or if you are not comfortable with splicing into wires. These just plug into your rear lights and your done.
5,Best Price....ANYWHERE!,"I looked EVERYWHERE for this and people on eBay are GOUGING $50,$60 and some even more then double dipping by RE-GOUGING $12, to $15 or even MORE on shipping and bogus ""HANDLING FEES"". This was so reasonably priced and FREE SHIPPING and was delivered FAST and top quality. It was SO EASY TO INSTALL. Works like a charm. I was going to cut my harness and solder in all kinds of hacked up wires with a universal plug but paid the extra few bucks and ....BAM....It was so easy to do with NO CUTTING of any wires. I am so happy with this product. 5 STARS."
5,Very Simple to Install This Kit,It took no more than 30 minutes from the time I opened the box until I was putting the last screw for the tail light. Worked correctly on the first test!
2,Only last about a year,I have tried Hopkins wiring harnesses for several times on my Toyota Tacoma. It is easy to install but after a year or two it no longer works on one side for the tail light or brake light. They are the best price but this time I will spend the extra bucks to try a Curt harness.
2,Applause For The Power Of The Spirit,"One of the few things I applaud about this book is Borg's emphasis on the power of the Spirit and the new life it can create. I am too firmly indoctrinated, however, in the popular image of the Jesus of the gospels to enjoy reading much about modern biblical scholarship's attempts to discover the historical Jesus."
3,Spray?,"I was a little disappointed. I've tried lightly spraying but it still dribbles off too quick. It does shine the leaves, but I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Mustek GSmart D35 Digital Camera,"Very ""Plastic"" Feel to it, Color was Purple (i thought it was blue) Functions badly in dark rooms. It's an 'ok' camera but you can get better for the money"
3,"OK, but not spectacular.",This is an OK toy. Was somewhat messy. Stamps were clear but not great. Just so so.
5,The Big Nothing,"The Big Nothing, by Adrian FogelinThe Big Nothing is about a boy named Justin whose parents are not getting along, and whose brother is being shipped off to the war in Iraq. His best friend Ben now has a girlfriend, and Justin feels left out. He is finding some relief from the outside world in discovering his talent for music, and falling for his piano teacher's granddaughter.The story develops through letters Justin writes to his brother, and the brother's responses. It is a story most young people can relate to, as it deals with everyday teenage situations, experiences and conflicts. Included are interracial relationships, and how they unroll in everyday, inner city life.I highly recommend it to all ages, including adults who wish to better understand teenagers. Everyone can relate to these characters."
4,Consistently unpredictable,"David Murray is one artist who never rests on his laurels. I have just about every note he's released (that's a lot of CDs!), and you can always expect two things: A quality set that has twists and turns; and a sense of adventure from a man who refuses to recycle themes just to maintain popularity. I'll add that his taste in pianists has led me, over the years, to some of my favorite artists, including DD Jackson, John Hicks, Don Pullen, Dave Burrell, and others - and I originally discovered David Murray via a McCoy Tyner recording.Waltz Again is partly a tribute to his late father. The first piece has the most dissonance, but it flows, makes sense, and is a pleasure. The other compositions are stronger melodically, but also travel inside and outside - my favorite kind of Jazz Journey. Once again, Davis Murray illustrates that he's a great artist - a veteran who is still restless."
2,"A Teaching Tool, Not a Reference Book","As a professional in the IT industry I did not find this book a helpful reference. Perhaps I did not carefully read the subtitle ""...in plain English"". So, this would be a good teaching tool, not a good reference book.Although written ""in plain English"" it is verbose. I really would not want to be a student reading all of this for a class. There is much repetition (a good technique for oral instruction). And much emphasis is given using BOLD, Italics, and Underscore. Whew!Finally, the list price is too high. I would borrow the book from a friend, but I would not purchase it on my own (especially if I were a student on limited income)."
5,"Nice, soft sheets that stay put!","After listening to my husband complain about our mattress, I bought a 4 inch tempur-pedic mattress topper. As a result, I had to buy a set of deep sheets to cover both the mattress and the foam topper. I am very pleased with my purchase of these sheets. They are very, nice quality sheets that fit well and stay in place! They have not faded after many washings and are oh so soft! I wish they came in additional colors that matched my bedroom so I could buy more!"
3,A Decent Massage Book for the Beginner,"Although this book is not for someone who is serious about learning massage techniques (I recommend getting Stewart Mitchell's The Complete Illustrated Guide to Massage) it's very good at making massage less intimidating and more intimate. There are actually some very good suggestions in the book and isn't a waste of money or time. But if you want more information on technique you'll need to get other books, as suggested above."
3,The book is OK but buy the video.,"As far as massage books go, this one is on par with with all the other ones out there. If you are thinking about getting this book, don't if you own a VCR. There is an instructional video out there by the same name and the same folks which is far superior"
1,soft core and inept,Playboy etc. has covered this territory for years without pretending to be a massage book. Save your money.
1,Not what I expected,"Reluctantly, I have to agree that this book is a slap-dash affair. Due to the very crude attempts at art it's hardly erotic. Weak writing and poorly put together. Pass."
2,Where's the beef?,The models in this book look like they were picked up in a local bus terminal. You want them to put their clothes back on. Good luck trying to take this seriously.
4,Works just as advertised....,"The first one we tried was the 2.5A model with a temperature rating too low for a heating application (72F) and it burned out internally, so we bought the 5A model with a higher temp rating and this one seems to work just fine. The first one didn't produce any whine in the motor where this one does, but it is still quieter with the whine than it was with the motor at full speed. Our application is a 1.5A, 980RPM fan motor."
2,"OK Earbuds, but noise-cancelling? Not really.","I set two standards for evaluation -- 1. No noise cancelling. and 2. My (expensive!) Bose noise-cancelling headphones that deliver superb sound and do an excellent job of cutting down on noise. When I tried these earbuds, I thought that the sound that they delivered (from my iPod) was good (hence the two stars), but a substantial hum was activated when I turned on the noise-cancelling feature and, in addition, I was unable to detect any noise-cancelling (in striking contrast with the Bose headphones) when I tried turning on kitchen appliances (a blender and a food processor). Obviously I probably shouldn't have expected the same performance from these earbuds that I got from the Bose headphones but, in fact, I couldn't detect any noise-cancelling at all from the earbuds."
5,A font of great ideas for cardmaking,"I agree with the other reviewer: I loved reading this book. I pored over every page and card idea.You get one sample recipe or template where the how-to's are explained and then several riffs on the recipe, all very different and done by different designers. It was easy enough to figure out how these other cards were made.I would describe the card elements used as being mostly those in a scrapbooker's arsenal: embellishments, ribbon, and patterned paper, and the designs are all very clean and contemporary. Hallelujah! There is hardly a country or Victorian/romance design in the bunch and for that I am very grateful.I am excited to get going on making some of these."
2,the joy of card making,I have so many card making books and magazines. Thisbook seemed repetitive and fairly elementry. I don't see myselfusing more than reading it once. A person just starting outmaking cards might find it quite imformative.
2,A magazine?,"I thought this was an actual book, but it is just a thicker magazine. It's okay. Good for the pictures."
1,The Monitor never fought the Merrimac,"I would not buy this book because the Monitor fought a Confederate Ironclad called the C.S.S. Virginia. The Virginia was built upon the salvaged hull of a union ship called the Merrimack (with a ""k""). There was another ship built by the union, called the Merrimac (without a ""k"") but it was a paddle wheel boat and it never fought the Monitor."
5,like,Like the product mounted real well in car stereo fit great used product two months now did not need extra stereo bracket to have fit
4,Useful for Beginners,"This is for someone who has never published a book. I've been writing for a long time but realized I needed some help getting my thoughts together. The ideas in this book are obvious, yet enlightening. For example, it's obvious that characters and plot should be awesome, but they explain how they should also be able to stand alone. At the end of this book, there are business tips as well. Everything Guide will not outline your novel for you...it's not that kind of detailed plot book."
3,Hopkins 43415 wiring kit for toyota 4runner,"After I install the cables and try to test it, and I found out the left and right signal was reverted each other. So I have to cut the wires from the wiring kit and reverted it back in order to turn the signals from the SUV to corrected them signals right to right and left to left to the trailer. I hope the manufacture corrected the problem so we ( the customers) do not have to do it twince."
1,Hopkins Tailer Light Converter,"Installation was a breeze, but it made my under performing factory converter (dead) look like a champ. Doesn't work, have opened the package, likley can't return it. Wasted my money and time!!!!!!"
4,I KNEW I WAS RIGHT,This man makes it too easy to buy great music.Look for Michaels name & youre laughin.This is good Badloves music only better.I want more.
4,"Wow, A Very Classy Release","I must admit I bought this CD on the basis ""Michael Spiby"" was a name that sounded familiar and ""what the hell...."" and I have been rewarded for my gamble. This is a very classy release, which quietly sneaks up and leaves its very warm laidback beats in your mind, so the next listen it sounds so familiar and friendly. This is not a CD to dance & rave with, more for a chatty easy get together or just play it for yourself!! This is fantastic music from an authentic musician and composer, easy, softly funky, friendly, grooving...."
4,"Good starting point, but you'll buy more...","Being a fan of psychedelic music, I have always heard of this band, but aside from the occasional song on some compilation, I have never given Amon Duul 2 a chance. Now I know what I've been missing! This group is incredible. It's progressive psychedelia that ranges from totally out there and lysergic to very melodic and accessible, sometimes within the same song! The vocals are an acquired taste, but the music is always compelling. The album lacks the extended jams from early albums like Phallus Dei, Yeti, and Tanz, but the song choices provide a good, albeit brief overview of the group's early '70's efforts. Now that I have listened to this disc many times, I find myself seeking out Amon Duul 2 albums. It's a good compilation, but this group needs to be heard in album format. As an introduction to the band, the CD is excellent."
4,Primer for the dawn of Krautrock,"Sometimes it takes seeing the gleam in someone else's eyes to produce the motivation to give a second shot at something that seems not immediately accessible. I have a friend who works at a record exchange who is enthusiastically applying her vast musical knowledge towards recording experimental sounds. Amon Duul represents the cornerstone for her component of ecstatic experimentation to the palette. I had to get over my bias towards awkward accents and Hawkwind primitivism to catch a glimpse of the same sonic chalice that motivates her pursuit. I'm not sure if my next move is to see if I can lose myself in one of their longer pieces, (Yetl or Tanz) or move on to Ash Ra. (Meanwhile, I'm starting to really put some work into a little sculpting with the TimeWarp 2600.)"
2,Another Misguided Compilation,"I don't like compilations and compilations do little justice to an album oriented band like Amon Duul II. Don't get me wrong the music contained herein is amonst their best however ""Kannan"" sounds out of place when not contained on the great lp ""phallus dei"" and this is the problem with the rest of the songs--they seem out of context slapped on a compilation album. the suggestion here is to pass on this and buy ""Phallus Dei"" and ""Yeti"" and if your still inclined to listen then search out the rest of their records....."
5,"Great video, but heartwrenching","I saw this movie several years ago. It took me days to stop thinking about it. I thought all of the acting was good-to-excellent, and the subject matter is extraordinarily powerful. This is NOT just for homosexuals or people coming to grips with AIDS. This is a wonderful exploration of the prejudices that occured with the emergence of AIDS in this country (and continue to be a problem in some quarters even today). But the subject matter is somewhat disturbing. It really makes you stop and THINK about the AIDS epidemic and it really brings home what is happening in Africa right now."
2,not really worth the time watching,This movie is about a doctor who tries to help those infected by aids in his home country. I didn't really like the movie but maybe those who wants a better understanding of HIV or AIDS may want to view it. It is something that a hetrosexual may not to view this movie. But the Homosexuals or HIV OR AIDS positive people may want to view it to show what people goes through with this deadly disease.
3,"Looks nice, but...","I bought this because it looked nice and was priced nice. However, it has one major flaw which drives me crazy-- the buttons on the side are *very* easy to push in, so much so that I am constantly bumping into them and changing the mode, time/date screen, etc. It'll do for now, but I'll get another kind of watch when this one goes."
2,great watch - if it held together,"i've owned 2 of these. both broke where the band joins the watch body and are unrepairable. loved the low profile, big numbers and illuminator, but got tired of them breaking."
2,One fatal flaw,"When I found this watch, and even for the first couple days I wore it, I thought it was a 5 star product. I was completely happy until the first day I wore it to work. I'm a critical care nurse and have to be able to GLANCE at my watch ALL the time. Simply put, with this watch you can't. The viewing angle for this display is dismal. I can't wear it to work. I really wanted to like this product, and if the viewing angle isn't a big deal then by all means get it. For what I need it didn't work. I realize this is a highly personalized review, but I feel like it's worth mentioning. Hope this helps."
2,Keep away from water!,I liked this watch with one big exception: it isn't water resistant at all. It seemed okay for the first couple of weeks with an occasional submersion in water but now it's full of water.I liked the large display and thin profile. The buttons stick out too far so the display mode keeps getting changed.I wouldn't recommend buying this watch.
5,Review of Casio Digital Watch,I really like this particular digital watch mostly because of its thin construction. It is easy to read and has actually generated compliments from others. It is also keeping very good time. My past experiences with Casios' is that they usually run a bit fast.
5,Owned for over seven years,"I've had this model watch for over seven years and i'm on my forth one. I just received two more and I guess I will continue to buy this watch until I can no longer find them online. This watch has every thing I need and nothing more and it looks good as a dress watch or for everyday use. I continue to buy this watch due to it slim light weight design and big digits, its like not wearing a watch at all. I never had to replace a battery and it continues to work although the only problem is one side of the band breaks after two years. I will try to wear it a little loose this time to see if I can make the band last. Other than that an excellent watch."
5,Great Value,"So slim and lightweight. Bought this for my elderly father, does not too many functions and is easy to read. Very happy with purchase."
4,Looks great,Got this for my boyfriend for XMas. He loves it and it looks great. Sleek design. He says it works good. Basic watch at a good price!
3,Looks good,"Wanted an every day watch, this looked good. The button for changing the 12 hour to 24 hour fuction continues to be activated by the movement of my hand. This might be due to the watch being slightly loose on my wrist (another notch, and the band would be too tight on my wrist).Other than that, functions well and looks good."
4,"Thin, cheap, looks good","I was looking for a watch for working out. This has a very low profile for a digital, is very light with an easy to read display. I have had it for 3 months and it's doing fine. The bands on digital watches are always the first thing to go, so many of the stories in other reviews regarding this do not surprise me. This band is a bit delicate compared to a hefty dive watch. Also the connection of the band to the face is not standard- you can't by a generic 20mm band to replace a broken one. But at 16 bucks, its not like you're losing much when it goes."
4,"Good watch, band needs improvement",I first purchased this watch because I needed one with an hourly chime but not a lot of bells and whistles. It is a good watch for what I needed at the time. It is not bulky either. I am on my 3rd watch because the plastic band breaks. This time I ordered a replacement band to go with it. I would be nice to have a better quality band on it. The first two watches are still ticking.
5,I would buy this again!,"I love this watch! I already had one but the LED display finally died after 9 yrs. I love that it is a thin lightweight watch that serves all my needs. It has a backlight, alarm, stopwatch, is waterproof and best of all it works in 24 hr mode. I love it so much I ordered 2 this time and will always order it so long as its available."
4,I love It - Make myself a Gift!,"I am a big fan of geeky, digital watches. This is in fact a very cool geeky watch. The digital face is very modern and I like the shape of the buttons that allow you to adjust the lighting, set alarms, use a stop watch.It looks great!It is exactly what I was looking for.Digital and thin.It works perfectly and is very light and durable.Programming the time, date etc, is very simple. The price makes it a great deal!Nice and good Product!"
5,Good value,"Nice watch, large and easy-to-see numbers. For a plain, no frills watch, this is a good buy."
5,I love it,"I can read the time very fast. It is very light, the armband is very flexible. The illuminator is a nice feature.I hope they keep it in production for the time this one breaks: I would buy it again and again. Very simple and efficient; good price."
4,Subtraction fun,"I got this for my 7 year old twin girls as a Christmas gift. It's March and it is still intact with the string despite the fact that they have let their one and two year old sisters play with it. I think that speaks volumes for it's durability. It took them a few tries to get the hang of the subtraction wrap. In the beginning I had to help them hold the string tight enough so that it didn't slip down to the wrong number, but it didn't take them too long to get the concept. Now we have fun setting the timer and racing each other to see who can finish the fastest."
2,Hard to see correct lines on back of key,"The key works by wrapping a string around the proper numbers on the front of the key. Then to check whether the answer is correct, you must flip the key over and look at the pattern on the back of the key. The pattern is made by raised ridges the same color as the key and is hard to see when the black string is wrapped around."
2,another boring book,"I wonder how many more books she can write about her life, and yet avoid reality"
2,DONT BUY!!,Sure they look pretty in the picture- so pretty in fact that I ordered them- BIG MISTAKE!!!! They were so cheap looking and the glitter was like falling off- The colors are ugly and one of the butterflies was so poorly glued on that it wasnt attached to the mirror! The other one had so much glue it basically took up the small dinky mirror-Again i repeat dont buy! I was so disappointed!!
3,BE MINDFUL ! ! !,"The reviews listed here are NOT for this CD release but are for the excellent Rufus FEATURING CHAKA KHAN lp from 1975! THIS HERE is the band's very first album release, and while impressive, they are still testing the waters. Because of the very similar album titles, the reviews were somehow transposed - which is what often happens under the circumstances! So, just be mindful if that sort of thing is important - to you!"
5,A real gem and a must have!,This is undoubtedly one of the best Rufus & Chaka productions. Chock full of hits!! I'm glad to finally add it to my collection once again.
4,Still hot after all these years,"Let's face it Rufus and Chaka Kahn were truly the thing for the 70's, but it's always good to step back and check music against time. Well in this case time becomes better than remembered and offers those who missed the first time an entry into the funk of it all. You'll find it will make you nod and smile. What more can you ask for, Enjoy!!!"
4,Still Love Rufus and Chaka,"Anything Chaka does is FIRE.I love Rufus and Chaka, to me it was the least thrilling album by them.I love Circles and Dance With Me the most."
2,Debut album by inferior first incarnation,"The reviews below where it says ""This refers to the Audio CD edition"": they actually refer to the later, classic album named ""Rufus featuring Chaka Khan"".There was no ""featuring Chaka Khan"" billing on this first album by the group, and frankly, I don't like it much. There was this other singer guy (Ron Stockert) who left after the second album (along with some other members), and he kind of gets on my nerves with his country-tinged songs and singing. It wasn't until the third album, ""Rufusized"", that Rufus & Chaka really hit their stride - and by then it was almost a whole new group anyway.The debut album isn't bad - ""Maybe Your Baby"" is good, ""Keep It Coming"", ""I Finally Found You"" and ""Feel Good"" are pretty nice... But there's nothing too remarkable here, really. And the whole thing feels unfocused.Don't bother getting this until you've bought all the other Rufus albums. I guess it's worth getting for its few good songs, or if you're a completist."
3,A blessing for hypochondriacs,"I thought the anthology of stories gave a rare insight into those at the scalpel handle end of medicine, being written by those in the profession, while helping me to shed some of my own hypochondria.While firmly rooted in medical knowledge/background the book still manages to be - dare I say - infectiously funny and I was much relieved to see that my syndrome is probably worse than many I 'could' have suffered.Couldn't help feeling that my fear of doctors had pleasantly eroded."
4,hard to find (three year search) and in good condition,"Most important, no surface scratches to prevent or mar playback. reasonably quick shipping.For d'Cuckoo fans of their later work, some will feel familiar, some less so. IMO the first four tracks make the purchase worthwhile."
4,AHEAD OF THEIR TIME,"Linking African rythms and instruments with high-tech synth triggers, the ladies of D'Cuckoo put on a joyous show. their performances helped catch the ear of Brian Eno, who worked with them in the studio at one point.Their sound unique, and it's a shame a broader audience could not see them."
1,Missing Items,In the description it said that I would receive a cd driver with the package and I didn't.
4,I really enjoyed this book!,"The premise - dealing with the mysterious disappearance and loss of a child - is not perhaps the most original, but this book's execution, telling the story from the eyes of the child's nine-year-old brother, certainly gave this book a unique feel. Though sad, the book still had moments of humour. A child narrator, when done right (as this one was) makes for a wonderful book. It was very British, with several turns of phrase that may leave an American reader a bit lost at times. However, this was very strong for a debut novel and I will definitely keep an eye out for any other books by this author!"
4,Read it and share it with others,"I picked up this book a month after my brother's suicide and found it both comforting and helpful. This book focuses on the grieving process and the reactions of those left behind. For someone who had never put much thought into the grieving process before, it gave the information I needed in a compasionate and down to earth manner.The author shares her own story of her son's suicicde and her path through the healing at the same time she is telling facts and research about suicide. It's what I imagine a suicide support group to be, but from the comfort of my own home.If you or a loved one have recently been impacted by suicide, this is worth looking into."
5,Wonderful - good reading,A must have for those who have lost a child to suicide - regardless of that child's age. My younger son took his own life at age 52 - all alone in a tiny apartment. I miss him.
5,Great buy!,"This paper punch is very simple and easy to use. It seems perfect for students at any level and can be carried along quite easily. I use it simply to punch my bank and credit card statements every month for filing, so I only need to punch one sheet at a time, I would not recommend it for more than 3 sheets though. Its a great buy, well worth the price. There is no backing to catch the punched circles, but that is hardly a problem."
3,"Nice, but hard between the legs and under the arms","We got this vest for our 4 y/o daughter. It seems very well made, and fits well. However, the straps under the arms rub badly no matter what we do (I would certainly never have her wearing it like in the picture without a shirt). It seems that all floatation devices with the between-the-leg straps are wedgies waiting to happen, but this strap has no covering, and little bend, so caused actual rub ""hot spots"" between her legs. Eventually, we switched her to a suit with floats around her abdomen and she is much more comfortable."
3,"Excellent, quick and smooth boring","I've only used this for a dozen or so deep bores for some impel rods, so I can't say how it holds up for long term use. It certainly has performed well for the tasks I threw at it. However, I does seem to have gotten a slight bend to it (I don't think my mind is playing tricks on me). It's still boring smoothly and cleanly and fine for my purposes, but given that I never thrashed it hard, I don't think it should be showing this problem at all. I've been using an 18V Dewalt cordless with no problems to drive it. I am not unhappy. I have a 6 inch Hitachi, however, which seems like it is better quality. If I were to buy again, I think I might try the long Hitachi instead of this one..."
3,"Quirky, catchy, far out pop music.","As enigmatic as any other Rephlex release, this little CD has really caght on with me. I picked up a used copy for 99 cents (yippy!) and its gotten plenty of play in my lasers. ""Disco Dancing"" is a silly song that most poeple really enjoy. ""You're the One"" is actually a very well-written song in a non-electronic sense, but like other Rephlex releases, its electronic textures are otherworldly. I am just so confused, though. I've been unable to find further information on this artist through searching the internet. How can an artist releasing (apparently) a remix EP/Single have never released an original version? The disc features a live version, two mixes by Cylob, and one Hardly Mix. In fact, You're the One seems to be Part II of which there is no Part One. Oh well, I love mysteries. Message me if you ever figure it out."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"While this book has a lot of information for people who have a puppy, it offers minimal information for someone like me who has just brought home an adult Staffy. The book has a lot of info on how to crate train a puppy, the importance of socialization and other topics that can pertain to adult dogs, but if there was just one paragraph on how to make an adult dog feel comfortable in it's new home, or what I should expect during the first week, I would have given this book 4 stars!I was also looking for a book that would give me the basics on what type of collar/brush/leash to buy, but when I got to that section, the authors advice was to ask your vet.While the pictures were great, I would quickly trade them for more information!"
4,"Good, reliable, neat-looking","I don't see why the other buyer is making a fuss about the pen not being a fountain pen. The title nor the picture states that. I owned one before, and got lost (or maybe taken by someone). Now, going to by another one. It is solid, heavier, and has an exclusive look. They used to have a matching mechanical pencil (don't know if they have it now). They are both beautiful."
3,A good start but not deep enough,"When I read a book with 'Mastering' in the title I expect something that gets down and dirty -- you know -- DEEP. This book doesn't do that.Although it would be a great book if I were completely new to NT Workstation, I've been using it for several years and I had already picked up 90+% of the contents of this book through osmosis.I felt the early chapters on the apps bundled with NT (such as wordpad and pbrush) were a total waste of time. The book is over 1000 pages long and I can write all the new/useful stuff I learned from it on one page.This is not 'Mastering' so much as simply 'Basics'."
4,An execllent all round introduction to NT4,"As an NT newby, this book taught me more about windows NT than I ever expected. I only wish I could have found a similar book for win95!It was not only and education in NT, but a good introduction to networking. However, the content was not heavily biased towards networkers.Overall, I found the book highly readable - once I started reading, I read it through to the end: all 1107 pages!"
3,Everything you want to know... all jumbled up,"This is a thorough treatment on NT Workstation 4.0. No doubt about it, it's all here. My criticism is the structure of the book, not it's content so my gripe is with the editors not the writer."
4,This book was very good and it had alot of details.,This book was avery good detailed book. It had alot of details on the fortae of things that could happen and things that will happen under magic and witch craft and all of the monsters the phenomnea and all the other things in the book.
4,Why?,"I was eager to read this biography because I have seen most of the films directed by John Ford and was interested in knowing more about ""his life and times."" I learned a great deal. Eyman provides a wealth of information. However, given Richard Schickel's observation that Ford was a director who ""delighted in in cruelty, publicly humiliating his casts and crews, a man who carried petty grudges for punishing decades and someone whose wihdrawals and silences profoundly damaged his family,"" I had hoped that Eyman would explain the reasons for so many of Ford's failed human relationships. Perhaps the title of one of my favorite Ford films -- They Were Expendable -- suggests one of them. Does Eyman agree with Schickel? Even if he does, he fails to reveal in this otherwise solid biography what Schickel calls ""the complicated truth"" about John Ford."
5,Bobby Lee Rodgers continues to turn out amazing tunes!,"This is the Japanese version of the 2006 'now' which was released here in the states. The Japanese version features a few tunes not available on the US release (but recorded during the same sessions)but a few tunes are not available on the Japanese release .VERY strong musicianship and great songs, melodically and lyrically. Rodgers and his band The Codetalkers have always been praised for their energy and are especially adept at turning a pop song into a lesson in song structure and improvisation. Rodgers is a serious musician with a sense of humor a mile wide; expect to hear sensitive ballads and churning rock anthems. This band is going places! This CD is selling VERY well in Japan and receiving great radio play! The label is also releasing the band's next CD titled ""Galaxy Girl"" either late 2007 or early 2008."
4,Great funk,"I saw these guys at Vegoose last year and they were one of the best bands of the entire weekend. Their live show is incredible.This is an excellent sophomore album. Songs like ""Ike"", ""Saved"", ""Sound Sister"" are old school funk. Whereas songs like ""Worlds Apart"", ""Broken Home"", and ""Sagitarius Face"" really highlight Bobby Lee's ability to write beautiful songs. ""Niagra Falls"" will surely be an all-out party as a live song (like ""Lima"") and ""Tumblin' Down"" is already a regular that brought the house down when I saw them play it.If you are looking for a cross between funk, southern-alt-country-rock, and whole lot more check these guys out. Great songwriting. Great vocals (Bobby Lee), and a really rock solid rythym section.Their first album is also very good, but too many Col. Bruce songs, in my opinion."
3,Should Be the Last Davies Book You Read,"I am an incredible Davies fan, and have lived in and/or travelled to many of the places he writes about. This trilogy takes place in ""Salterton"", a thin veiling for Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and Queen's University, located there.Unlike his other university-set novels, Salterton features contempt for the frivolity of faculty and persons who live in a small town. While not entirely inaccurate in his portrayal of a small university-centered Canadian town, it doesn't relish academia in the way that the Cornish trilogy does.As always, the pages are rife with attention to detail and tangential storylines are fleshed out with loving care. It is as if seven or eight short stories collide into three great novels. If you enjoy these, I strongly recommend the Deptford and Cornish trilogies; both are better examples of Davies' literary gifts."
4,Nice Blend,"I really enjoyed the mix on this CD, it was a really great blend of some different songs."
2,Review of Postscript Language Manual,Manual was not clear and detailed. Was expecting something with a more complete reference with examples. This was not it. Would not recommend to others.
2,Gummy and overly sweet.,"My 3 year old son is allergic to all nuts and soy. When I saw this in the store I thought it would be a great way to make a fast dessert the whole family could eat. The 3 year old told me it was yucky, ate the frosting off his slice and then threw the cake itself away. As stated in the title it is gummy and way too sweet. I will not be purchasing this product again. There are other mixes that have much better results and making a cake from scratch is not that difficult."
4,Big fan - people without allergies actually eat it too!!!,This stuff is great for those of us with allergies. I can finally have birthday cake. Usually egg free cake is virtually ineatable. This stuff is so good people without allergies actually ask for seconds. That sounds like a ringing endorsement to me!!! (Note - stay away from the gluten free products - unless you must - they tend to taste like chalk.)
2,Interesting Perspective,"Moffatt seems to present an Aryan perspective to Jewish writings in his liberal ""translation"" of the Bible. If you already have several other translations and are looking for one which breaks away from the crowd, this may be the translation for you."
4,Great addition to den stereo,"This strikes me as a well-made speaker that's perfect for fleshing out the bass in a den or other relatively small room. The secret is not to overdrive it - it is for filling in the lows that the smaller speakers can't handle, not for booming out distorted bass. For my setup I've found the best results with a Gain setting at about 50%, and a Freq setting at about 30%. I've found it's made a big difference in the listening experience on all types of music. Very good quality for the price."
2,Decent while it lasted.,"The subwoofer worked well enough for about 6 months ( Not exceptionally big sound but about what you would expect for a 8"" sub).Then it just stopped working. Replaced the fuse and it worked for about 24 hours before it stopped again.Replaced the fuse a couple more times but still no go. Replaced the cable just in case this was the problem but it wasn't. Not too upset since the subwoofer wasn't too expensive but still bummed out all the same."
4,"Misleading name, fine product","Be sure to note that this is the MINI Nativity set even though that isn't mentioned in the name. The manufacturer (Enesco) and the artist (Jim Shore) both make a distinction between the regular ""Nativity"" and the ""Mini Nativity."" The name here inexplicably omits ""Mini"" even though that is what it is. The detailed description includes the correct dimensions, and this is a fine miniature set, but the name is misleading and should be changed."
4,All around driver,"A great game if you are looking for a all-around driving game. Tons of different cars with different handling characteristics that can be tweaked. If you want NASCAR racing, you got it. Rally racing? Got that too. Lots of different tracks. The campaign game is challedging, but not overly frustrating. This game challedges you on having a variety of racing skills that you need to have. If you want just one racing game to cover a variety of different racing genres, this is it."
3,deceptive marketing,"basic cabbage cutter works OK,but why can't they be honest in the description-'genuine hardwood sideboards'-the main board is plywood;is it quality marine ply? who knows,because it's not in the description. This item comes from LEE MANUFACTURING COMPANY & one assumes they make it - WRONG! just another cheaply made in China throwaway."
2,COLE SLAW,NOT TOO IMPRESSED. THE BLADE DOESN'T STAY IN THE POSITION I PUT IT. FOUND MY OLD PLASTIC ONE EASIER TO USE.
3,Mirror nuts and bolts.,Furniture is ok in construction however when it arrived the mirror was broken. I emailed the company it took a couple weeks to resolve it and it when the new mirror did arrive the hardware to mount it wouldn't fit. I ended up having to go to the hardware store to find replacements vs waiting 2 more weeks to get the right hardware.
4,"Sturdy, Classy, Budget Priced Vanity","I bought this vanity for my wife to use in our apartment in our bedroom and she absolutely loves it! It shipped very quickly and it was packaged very well.The reason I took away a star is because the vanity didn't come with any assembly instructions. I was able to build it in about 20 minutes without the instructions, so clearly the lack of a manual isn't such a huge deal. However if you are not handy or have had experience with building in the past the lack of instructions could be more of an issue. However, the company website most probably has a pdf manual.The drawer also is not on a typical track so if you pull too far the draw can come out.Other than that the vanity looks beautiful and elegant and seems sturdy and well made. It has a small profile so it would fit well in a small bedroom or a large bathroom. I would recommend this vanity any girl or woman looking for an inexpensive and elegant way to organize and don their makeup in the morning:)"
4,Nice for the price,Very pretty and my girl loves it. Dark mahogany color with a nice seat cushion. It is made of particle board for the most part so don't use the chair as a stool.
3,Okay,You get what you pay for. Its not super great but for the price it is perfect for my tween daughter she loves it and if she breaks it oh well it was cheap.
3,"Looks Nice, Cheap Materials.","I bought this vanity for my girlfriend who wanted it for the bedroom. It looks very nice and is a decent size for what she needs but the materials are very cheap. If you're a guy putting this together, be careful because it is very easy to over-tighten the hex screws and warp or crack the wood.The packaging is terrible. It is lined with old styrofoam that breaks apart into a million pieces and makes an unavoidable mess on the carpet. Also there were a few small scratches on several pieces of the vanity due to the shoddy pack job.Cosmetically this thing looks great. I would recommend it for young girls and wives/girlfriends who need a vanity that won't necessarily be around for a decade. I still recommend this product, but just understand, as always, you get what you pay for."
5,Beautiful Vanity!,"Purchased this vanity for my wife. It came well packaged. However, it did have a couple of scratches on the cherry wood finish. They were not that noticeable. Overall, excellent quality of materials. Very nice finish. Easy to put together. Wife is very happy with it. Great buy."
1,Didn't even get to use it,"I bought this for my mom as a Christmas gift. She unwraps it and was extremely excited. My husband opens the box to assemble it for her and the mirror is broken. We dump out all of the glass thinking that maybe we can just replace the mirror, but after removing the rest of the packing we find that the ""finish"" has chipped off all over the rest of the vanity. This was more than just some damage from shipping. I was not impressed and will not be buying anything else from this dealer."
4,Two Piece Vanity,"I was surprised at the size, hoping for something a little more adult-sized. However, it is beautiful, was easy to assemble, and was greatly appreciated by the recipient."
