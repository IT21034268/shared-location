2,"Nice idea, rarely used in my kitchen",I was excited to purchase this but frankly a knife and cutting board work just as well and are easier to clean!
2,Useless and bulky.,"Ordered this so my wife could cut fresh herbs instead of fingertips. Used it once, and the herbs stick to the blades and it doesn't save any time. Come to think if it, what's so safe about this if you have to handle the blades to get your herbs out?It sits in the drawer taking up space while I cut the herbs."
5,Evanovich is the BEST!,"This series is great, can't wait for the 12th book to come out. These are quick, easy reads and fun. I find myself staying up later than I should to finish each book!"
4,Frozen Waves,"Surfin' Christmas contains splended surf guitar with the best songs Cristmas has to offer. It is a must have for any surf fan in the Christmas spirit. The highlight track of the disk is ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"". This track has many unexpected twists and turns that add a much needed new spin on this tune."
5,A hard rock classic already!!,"Now this is a truely amazing CD! With inspiration and musicianship from Deep Purple, Rainbow and other hard rock bands from the 1970's Moonstone Project resurrects a wonderful sound that demands to be heard! I'm a 48 year old rock n roll fanatic and I have collected over 2000 cd's and 1500 albums to date and this is one of my all time favorite cd's already! It's that good! Damn good! Sooooo good it must be purchased! It must be listened to often and artists like Matt Filippini must be encouraged to continue making cd's just like this one! This is the antidote to bad rock music and pop icons like Britney Spears! Crack open this cd and heal thy soul! Radio one get busy!!!"
5,An excellent read - a must for any manager,The book give excellent advice for any manager who is lookling to improve the teamwork within the organization.
5,Inspirational Book!,This book is a must read for anyone who works with others!Joe and Luke impart their years of experience in communications and leadership in an easy to read style. Joe's Birds is a practical approach to relating to others that can be applied at work or home.Pick this one up for your home and work librarys.
5,Start here!,This is the place to start any indepth consideration of country and western music. In fact Dr. Malone's survey and Nick Tosche's COUNTRY THE BIGGEST MUSIC IN AMERICA are my two favorite introductory volumes. Each book is radically different from one another with Dr. Malone's history by far the more authoritative and serious consideration while the Tosche's book operates more as stream of consciousness fan's notes.
4,For Every Country Music Lover's Shelf,"An excellent reference tool for country music scholars and enthusiasts alike -- a 'who done it' of country music.If you aren't looking for every detail of every aspect of everything country music, you may want to look elsewhere... but if you are, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU.The prose has a narrative quality to it that makes reading enjoyable, while at the same time filling you with every detail imaginable.I recommend picking up this one up! Just make sure you get the most recent edition; it has been updated several times."
5,A must Read for all Fathers,"Marc Pitman opens his heart and soul in this book. This book is one of those books that you find yourself grabing your children and never letting them go. I read it in one sitting and the next day I bought 10 more copies to give to every father I knew. I cried, laughed, and most of all was reminded how tomorrow is never promised. This book has wisdom for fathers that will change the way children are raised. Love is the main theme, and a true love between two men, which is hard to find today was clear. The men that I have given the book to, have read it, cried, hugged their children and passed the book on to others. A must read!!"
5,A must read for parents and their kids,"I was given this book by a very dear friend, a Mom who has a son. I have 3 daughters and I have to say that I can relate to so many things Marc talks about with his young teenaged sons. I truly believe the lessons and experiences inside this glorious little book will touch any parent. It is not only for fathers but for mohters too. I plan on purchasing several copies to pass along to my daughters. Out of a heart wrenching tragedy comes poignant insights to our relationships with our kids. May generations of families make this a must read!"
4,Epson RX 580,"My older Epson C80 died and I needed a reasonably priced replacement which provided quality photo printing, as well as clear, crisp text in printing documents. I got it with the Epson 580! The scanner and copy abilities are an added bonus. (I would give this printer 5 stars, but copy quality is a bit fuzzy.) However, my photos are fabulous! No lines, sharp and clear. Also, it was up and running within 15 minutes of being out of the box. (I am a computer illiterate, hence my love of Mac.) I am a little worried about replacing ink cartridges, as I've heard they don't last long, but all in all I highly recommend this printer."
4,Ink & Printer,"I think today printing is not about Printers, it's about Ink. This Epson Printer is very good, the Epson Ink has excellent quality for home printing. I just subtract a star due to the high ink consumption and its associated costs.I'd suggest that the printer maker could sell the ink supply and give the printer for free. And, for the review magazines, besides to show the printers velocity, quality and so ever, they could show the ink average consumption and related costs, because what really matters, is the (total) price / performance, isn't?"
1,Worst printer ever,"I bought this printer two and a half years ago and I absolutely hate it. I hate it so much that I will never buy another epson product for as long as i live. I swear it eats ink, you can put a full cartridge in it, not use it once and in two weeks it will be at the 50% level. I have put in brand new cartridges at a cost of almost 70$ and only printed about 10 things before they are empty. In addition to that Once even one of them is empty, it is useless you cant print even in black and white or use the sd, or flash card slots.Next time this thing runs out of ink I am buying a new Kodak printer in lieu of new ink."
1,"If you want serious photo prints DON""T buy",As a photographer I have need for professional prints.I find the quality of the prints from this machine to fail miserably.I have been able to print out maybe 50 good prints after that they started to deteriorate.I now can print nothing at all because of the lines blotches and streaks through out my photos.I never could get the print on cd to work properly.Though it does scan well. I bought this brand new so I should not have had any problems with it.
1,Can die after 6 months of using it.,"...and DID die after 6 months of using it. And it wasn't just that its ink was not reading (which, it wasn't, even EPSON brand ink), the printer just decided to kick the bucket. And when you try to return the ink that you have purchased a million times for it, customer service will tell you to sell the $80 ink to a ""friend"", and not accept a return, or give you a refund. The scanner is great, but if you want a scanner, buy a scanner. Don't buy this printer. Or EPSON products, unless you want terrible customer service."
2,Unable to scan to file if ink is empty,I purchased the printer a few years ago and have not used it much except for scanning. It is rather unfortunate that when the printer runs out of ink it not longer allows you to scan documents to a file. I fail to see why having no ink should prevent file scanning but such is the case. Look elsewhere for a more suitable printer.
2,Can't use the printer if any of the 6 ink cartridges are out of ink.,"This is my fourth Epson printer and probably my last. The Epson RX580 needs several ink cartridges. If ANY of them is out of ink, you can't print at all. If you're out of yellow ink, you still cannot print a purely black/white document!! The system should at least default to black printing when a color runs out.I really resent that Epson is taking advantage of customers like that."
2,Great output but teeny weeny expensive ink cartridges,"Just bought it today. The print quality is excellent. However, I had to go back to the store for more ink later in the day (about $90 for a full set) after printing only a couple hundred pages of medical lecture notes for school. Ouch!!!I'll bet cleaning the heads costs about $5. This will probably be my last Epson because of the high cost of ink. To bad the manufactures don't recognize that screwing their customers on the ink lowers the customers satisfaction with them as a company."
3,All-in-one at an affordable price,"This printer accommodates MS Pro, XD, Compact Flash and SD memory cards; allows for camera connection via USB interface. It is a color/ b&w copier, scanner and inkjet printer. I've had it for about 3 years and it is still doing well. The CD/DVD printer attachment is a bit sketchy but does work well once you master the process. The software suite that comes with this printer is great. I really wish Walgreens would refill the ink cartridges. If they could, I'd be even happier with this device."
3,This printer is ALRIGHT,"It REALLY bugs me that this printer will not function without replacing the empty cartridges within a certain amount of time. Come to think of it I am not really sure why we purchased a color printer in the first place. I never print in color and am about to replace the original color cartridges that it came with. My husband used up the colored ink over time and tonight I needed to print something for school and was unable to because this dumb printer all of a sudden demands a new cartridge. UGH. Stupid me and stupid printer. BTW, I will never buy an Epson again only because you can refill cartridges for any other printer at Costco for dirt cheap. Overall it is a great printer and serves its purpose very well. But these are defining factors that had I known in advance I would not have purchased it."
5,Epson Stylus Photo 580,"Since receiving my Epson Stylus Photo 580 I've been scanning in old photos for preserving and restoring, printing stored digital photos of people and places, and scanning historical documents for family tree archives.Aside from having a somewhat dinky viewing screen which makes viewing, cropping and editing a bit difficult ... the versatility of this machine and the documents and photos it produces are nothing short of awsome. Photo print quality is magnificent: Colors are true-to-life,vibrant, and the resolution and detail are outstanding.I printed a series of scenes from a recent trip to Colorado, and the photo quality is so good it's like being there.Old, muddy looking photos take on new life after I've scanned and restored them. The restorals look far better than the originals, with the added bonus that I now have the old photos in digital storage."
2,Send your Claria ink epson Printers back.,"Epson new Claria Ink Printers Suck INK like Monica LewinskyAll us Epson users should buy the R260, R380, or RX580 and then print like crazy till ink runs out (25 or 30 8.5 x 11) and return for a full refund to dealers who do not charge you on a return with ink all used up. Some do and some don't.That way Epson will get the message on this series and change something. $3 to $4 ink for a 8.5 x 11 plus paper price plus your time isn't worth it no matter that the print is great. All us pros and semi-pros should boycott Epson for a while!"
1,hate this all-in-one printer-scanner,"I really and truly hate this machine! What were the manufacturers thinking of when they made the entire machine come to a screeching halt, just because it is out of ink!! What is the point of being an all-one-product, if it will only work if one base aspect is working. What the?? I thought I was buying a scanner along with a printer, but apparently that is not really the case. This is the most frustrating product I have used in years! Do yourself a favor and find another scanner/printer/fax combo."
1,"Big, useless brick","Bought this printer for my wife. After she exhausted the first set of ink cartridges we bought authentic Epson replacements but get the error ""cannot recognize ink cartridges."" Tried cleaning the contacts with alcohol, etc., as recommended on some blogs but no dice. Even bought ANOTHER set of cartridges with no improvement. So it's been sitting like a big ugly brick on her desk ever since. Will be taking it to the dump soon and will never buy Epson again."
1,"Horrible printer, runs out of ink after 30 color copies","We have had this printer for 6 months. It is a money pit. It runs out of ink after 30 copies, the copy quality is poor and it costs a small fortune to replace the cartridges so frequently. Stay FAR away from this printer - save your money."
2,"Good print quality, but ink runs out very, very quickly","I purchased the printer for the 'high definition' printing and because it can print on CDs/DVDs. I owned an HP Deskjet before that and what people say about HP ink fading after a couple of years is true.I am very satisfied with the print quality. The software is a little clunky, especially the CD printing function... looks like Windows 95 to me. What really, brought my rating of this printer down is the fact it literally drinks more ink that any other printer I've owned. I print mostly black and white, but the other colors run out very fast too. They are very expensive to replace and I don't feel the printer cartridges last nearly as long as advertised.The ink replacement frequency, coupled with high ink costs, make me regret this purchase. I am looking for new printer soon."
1,Worst Epson Printer I have ever owned....money down the drain,I had Epson back when they were the only printer still supporting the Mac....and most of them have been pretty good....but this one guzzles ink like crazy. The software is buggy and you can't stop a print if something goes wrong. You'll have to restart and it consumes more ink when you turn it back on. The features sound impressive and you would think Epson would produce a decent product...no...not this one!! Colors are kinda off too. I wish i returned it earlier.
3,Driver install failed until upgrading to Mac OS 10.4,"Although the printer performance has been satisfactory in the two days I've had it working, the Software printer driver installation process was a problem for me. Epson claims Mac OS 10.3 - 10.4 compatibility, but I had to spend an extra $150 to upgrade my 10.3.9 OS to 10.4 before the drivers would install successfully. Prior to upgrading, the driver install program always hung with ""6 Files remaining to install"" and message saying ""Searching: HD"". After I gave up on 10.3, bought a new OS, upgraded, and got install to work, Epson finally replied to my email to their online support (only 3 days to respond) with some generic instructions on ""How to install on Mac 10.4..."", which would further indicate it probably doesn't really work with 10.3 version as they advertise. Hope this review saves someone else from the aggrevation I went through installing their SW drivers..."
4,So far so good...,"I received this printer as an early Christmas gift from my parents. after going through two HP printers (both under 100 dollars) which both ended up in perpetual paper jams from hell I finally gave up trying to buy a new printer. I installed my new Epson two days ago. the set up process was pretty easy as long as you follow the directions, after it was installed it started working right away and perfectly. I've printed a few sheets, scanned in my daughters school photos and printed one all without any problems. I haven't tried it with actual photo paper yet, so I'll have to update this review in the future.so far so good :)"
1,THIS MACHINE WAS A TOTAL LET DOWN!!!!!,"THE PRINTER ARRIVE DOA.ON THE SUPPORT, NO ONE ANSWER'S EMAILS, ONLY AUTOMATED EMAILS. OVER AND OVER AGAIN.I TOOK THE PRINTER EVEN BEFORE OPENING IT, TO AN OTHER COUNTRY TO DO MY JOB, BUT NO ONE IS GIVING ME ANY RESPONSE, I TOOK THE PRINTER TO EPSON SERVICES TO USE THE WARRANTY IN THIS COUNTRY (VENEZUELA) AND HERE IN EPSON SERVICES THEY JUST WASHED THEIR HANDS, BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTED ITEM.EPSON IS ZERO RESPONSABILITY."
1,Big Mistake,"I did all the research and deceided to try this Epson because it's an all in one type photo printer. I noticed it was very loud and right off the bat had loading problems. Pictures were not good either, color was incorrect and there were lines in photo. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Poor quality photos,"Maybe it is an incompatibility problem with Windows Vista, but I am unable to print any good-quality pictures on any kind of paper. After trying several ""maintenance"" options and every single print setting, nothing has worked. Epson responded by saying to make sure I use Epson cartridges (which we did because they came with the printer). I am returning this because it is useless as is."
1,Returned to store same day,"Ran into an Epson rep at Bestbuy and he recommended this printer. Looked really nice, but could never load the ink. Spent well over an hour trying to do what should have taken 1 minute. Spent 20 minutes on the phone with Epson tech support. She basically read the manual to me, then told me to take it back. Hats off to Bestbuy who took it back no questions asked.Oh well the search continues for a printer. Looks like a Canon or HP.Update: Picked up the HP D7360 today on sale.Ink cartridges loaded on the first try.Was up and running in just a few minutes.Select photo quality print in set up and use HP Advanced Photo Paper for excellent results. Very pleased with this printer so far.HP Photosmart D7360 Printer"
1,Very poor product!,This is the first and last Jet product I'll ever buy. Very poor design includes a internal mitered corner that has sharp edges and reduces flow area by at least a third. If you want a dust collector that plugs up use these elbows.
5,Technicals,"When installing a dust collection system, eliminating resistance to airflow is what it is all about. The ideal is as large a pipe as possible, flowing in a straight line, without any ridges in the surface. Of course in the real world at least some of these things wind up being less than ideal. What this Jet 4"" elbow does, is give you a large pipe, that makes a gradual turn as opposed to a straight 90 degree angle, and the sides of the elbow are smooth. So when you need to make a turn with your air flow, this elbow does the nicest job.The fit snugs neatly inside the standard 4"" flex pipe. With some 4"" Jet wire clamps which are also highly recommended over standard pipe-band clamps and this Jet elbow your all set for some hassle free collecting."
5,Country Music,"Bill Anderson truly is a legend of country music. The so-called ""country music"" recorded today is NOT real country music. I have been a Bill Anderson fan since the '60's."
5,Mugworts Forever!,"Linda Rago is a great author! It is because of this book in particular that I recognized the good luck of having Mugwort in my own garden. Without this book, i would have attached no significance at all to having Mugwort, and would have just considered it a pesky weed adding to my frustration and depression regarding war on such things. However this book made me open to the wonders and magic of Mugwort. Not only can i use it in herbal smoking blends (""Sailor's Tobacco""), but it actually competes in the garden with worse weeds like crab-grass, poison ivy, etc. and is far easier to weed when the time comes."
2,All Right Train or Plane Read but Definitely No Joy Read,"The Joy Riders doesn't reach any literary heights and a predictable ending does nothing to make it any more rememberable. The Joy riders is the story of a few days in the life of poor fourteen year old girl Jo, whose father walked out on her and whose mother has to work a number of jobs to keep her brother and herself alive. One of the two biggest losers on the housing estate who everyone including the school teachers is afraid of fancies her and when she doesn't turn up to an arranged car park meeting with him he takes her younger brother along with him and his friend as they steal cars and takes polaroids of her brother enjoying himself. Jo now has a choice, either come along and join in the car thefts the next night or the photographs get sent to the police.Weak characters make this book a definite miss. If Jo is so caring about her brother and supposedly smart she would definitely come up with better decisions."
2,Louie Louie Rides Again,"A collection of their ""hits"" although I only recognized ""Louie Louie"" and ""Jolly Green Giant"". The others may have been hits, but I missed them. If you need ""Giant"", buy it. Otherwise pass it up."
5,"Blazing fast transfers with USB 2.0, great product!",IOGear card reader is really fast. I've used some other USB 2.0 multi card readers but this one is definitely faster. I went looking for an SD card reader in stores and everyone seemed to have ones which attach to your computer with a USB cable. I wanted something more portable and efficient and found this perfect for my needs. This one takes SD and MMC cards. There is another version for micro SD and trans flash cards.Since the SD card goes inside it you can use this like a zip drive and it gives you the flexibility to swap cards without having to erase data. It is a military green color and the cap attaches to the body with a silver thread so it won't fall off. There is a tiny spring clasp at the end if you want to hook it on to something like a key chain.
2,Can it be cost justified??,"In comparision to the counterpart black hose, the only advantage I can think of is that you can see thru this hose to easily identify where any possible clogs are located. With the black hose you have to use trial and error, and possible take the entire DC system apart to find the clog. With the clear hose, you can see it and go right to the problem spot. Is this worth almost double the price of a black hose?That can only be answered by the user. I'm using the clear hose only off of machinery where large chips are make, my lathe and bore machine (drill press). Other than that, I opted for the cheaper black hose. I also have those two machines located the closest to the dust collection machine, so the hose length, and chip travel, is the least possible."
3,Better pricing,Why pay more for the jet name...this hose is great but I get this exact item in 50' lengths for less than $60.00 from other sources. Save your money and do a search.
3,As good as it gets but overpriced,"I've tried about 6 different kinds of dust collection hose and this is the finest quality. It's transparent and pliable yet rigid enough to hold its shape with 1600 CFM. It also is a rubbery texture so it will hold fast to finicky/poorly designed blast gates like Eco-Gate.Good quality aside - this hose is way overpriced.Rockler has similar quality hose for much, much less money."
3,Didn't quite grab me like I though it would,"I really enjoyed ""A Season for the Dead"" and thought I would really like this book as well. Unfortuantely I was kind of dissapointed. It's a good story, but the charachters really seemed to lack something, and I had a little trouble keeping some of them straight. It's not a bad book, the ending was actually very good. I think a little more charachter development would have really made this a great book."
2,Dissapointed.....,"I'd give this 2 1/2 stars if I could, but since I can't it only gets 2 stars. The historic storyline was vivid & beautifully written, however the parallel present-day plot did nada for me. In addition, the characters in the present-day setting didn't seem as developed either. This bk. had such possibilities... By mixing the 2 tales it completely ruined this bk. for me & the 2 stories never seemed to fit together. The bk. isn't awful, just disappointing."
3,Could have been much better,"This book could have been a much better read. The author could have taken this interesting story and made it much much better had he not played out the gimick of mirrored tales which left the book limp and predictable. Too bad for the reader. I do not recommend spending the money for this book. Check it out at the library, maybe."
2,Disappointing,"I've read several of his other books about policement in Rome and Venice and this was much less interesting and complex, even though it actually shares some of the same characters. It was a let-down."
2,"Ok, I got stuck again :(","So, well, this is the second time I am putting this thing down (stuck at chapter # 46).Honestly, if you want to die of boredom, this is IT! Instead, I'll take something that will tease and test and exercise my brain. Mr.Pavic for example.I just do not know where to begin. Characters are unbelievable. The young ones (Daniel and Amy) lead discussions and lil' talk as if they are at least ten years older - with maturity and knowledge above all. I don't think so.I made a mistake I thought I never would. I judged the book by its cover. Thankfully, I bought it for only a buck. Time is also money though :(."
5,tiny powerhouse,"I switched from a Treo on Sprint to this Blackberry Pearl on T-Mobile and am happy with the phone and the service. The phone is *tiny* compared to the Treo and was a snap to set up. The battery life is fantastically long compared to the Treo. I went with the MyFavs plan, which has been great, allowing me to chat with my loved ones without watching the clock. Not to mention, I pay *much* less for a similar plan to the one I had on Sprint.I even got GTalk and Google maps easily setup on the Blackberry, with IMs coming into my central message box. That's perfect for me because I use GTalk to stay in touch normally, and this way I'm not tied to my computer. It also is a nice way to IM via the phone with out txt charges.Love it, love it, love it."
5,Great book all about Guide Dogs,"If you are looking for a very informative book about Guide Dogs, this is the one!(The review below me by ""A reader from Pennsylvania"" is wrong, this book is not about bomb detection, it is all about Guide Dogs. They were reviewing a different book in the same series called ""Bomb Detection Dogs"". I've notified Amazon of the error but for whatever reason they have not yet corrected it.)This book here includes stuff on how guide dogs are trained as well as background on puppy raising of future Guide Dogs. Also covers how the dogs do their job of being ""eyes"" for the blind. Geared towards younger readers, this book will provide plenty of fascinating information for people of all ages."
5,Thomas Merton recommended this book to me,"When I was a Trappist novice at the Abbey of Gethsemani, in 1956, this is the one and only book Thomas Merton recommended that I read!"
5,Oldies,A great collection of old love songs from the 60's that no collection should be without. Definitely worth the price.
2,Personal Fear Abounds,"As a former Chicago improviser in all the new waves she writes about, and a teacher now trying to influence my own students (especially women and minorities) to continue their improv education in the undisputed improv capital, Chicago, I would do my best to keep this book out of their hands. It is a clouded pseudo-history littered with deluded conclusions resulting from her own fears as a female improviser. The talented people I had the pleasure of working with of all colors and genders did not play out of this place of fear that is evident throughout the book, but a place of love for each other and what they do. But I must say kudos to her for even putting a pen to paper about a most neglected subject and I wish that some of the brilliant teachers mentioned in the book would write their own truth about their theatre histories and theories to share with budding improv students throughout the country."
1,A sadly wasted opportunity,"Dr. Seham has the makings of a potentially valuable book here -- she comprehensively details the histories and inner workings of almost all the major improvisation/sketch comedy companies (as of publication date), including The Second City, ImprovOlympic and others. Sadly, she sees fit to contaminate her narrative with intrusive and fallacious critiques bearing all the fingerprints of Marxism, postmodernism and radical feminism..."
1,What a load of cr@p,"please, please, PLEASE avoid this book at all costs. It perpetuates the myth that the Chicago scene somehow stifles women. Which is, if you ask most WOMEN in the Chicago scene, clearly a bass-ackward accounting. In fact, most groups around town are actively LOOKING for women to join; it's not a ""all-white boys club"" because of any exclusionary policies.Also, somehow lost in her diatribe is the mere fact that half the teachers and coaches, as well as the owner/operator of IO, are women.Sad, sad, sad."
4,It is a rotor,Bought thrse to replace the rotors on my 98 XJ. They are a direct fit and the anti-corrosion finish on them is great. Been on the Jeep for 9 months now and no problems.
4,Peace of Mind,"Livatone Plus Powder contains many of the ingredients and nutrients that I need in a form which is easy to ingest with a compromised liver. I only wish some of the vitamins, etc., were of stronger strength. But it does fill a very necessary need and I do appreciate having come accross it."
4,Turtles: One GREAT live band,"Most people would probably agree on one thing in the world of recorded music: While a band might be able to wow us with what they laid down in the studio (thanks to as many takes as may be needed to get one good-sounding result), there are precious few who can do so live. (There may even be one or two groups out there that are better live than in the studio.) On ""Happy Together Again"", the Turtles prove, for those of us who weren't lucky enough to see them before they broke up, that they rank among the best bands ever to record live. If you already know the Turtles' music, you can't get better value for money than this disk provides. If (somehow or other) you don't know about the Turtles, you owe it to yourself to add this CD to your collection, since the Turtles were an important part of the evolution of American rock in the '60s."
1,Not a thicker gauge than an average power cord.,"Some reviewers have commented that this cord is a ""pretty heavy gauge"". One even claims the cord is 14 awg. Well I received my cords and they are 18 awg, the same gauge as your average power cord. In what sense then do these cords deserve to be called ""premium"" power cords? I don't know."
5,I stuck it in. It worked.,"Just received mine and used it to power an older Dell Optiplex GX260 desktop. The 6ft length is very convenient. If I have any problems with it down the line I will let shoppers know. In general all my products from Cables To Go have worked great over the last 6 months, even though they are very affordable."
5,kddamren Pwr Cord,These cable were purchased for my grandson; he is the electronic expert; cables arrived in a new wrap and not only was it a good price but arrived very quickly.
5,STOP THE HOSE COMING OFF THE FITTINGS,"I FIND THIS SET EXCELLENT WITH NO PROBLEMS EXCEPT FOR SOME COMPLAINTS THAT I'VE READ ABOUT THE TAPERED FITTING THAT CAUSES THE HOSE TO SLIDE OFF. I TRIED SOME PLUMBERS PVC PIPE CLEANER AND ALSO APPLIED SOME PVC CEMENT THEN CLAMP THE HOSE. JUST BE SURE THIS IS WERE YOU WANT IT CAUSE ONCE ITS THERE THATS IT. I ALSO USED 4"" SCD 20 RIBBED SOLID PVC DRAIN PIPE & FITTINGS THAT WORKED GREAT AND ALSO SEARCH THROUGH THE LOCAL HOME CENTER FOR PVC FITTINGS, LOT CHEAPER THAN ALL THE COLLECTOR FITTINGS. HOPE THIS HAS BEEN OF ANY HELP."
2,A career in steep decline,"If you like Matthew Sweet then stick to listening to your copies of Girlfriend and 100% Fun. In case you didn't get the hint from In Reverse or The Thorns, Sweet's glory days are behind him. Living Things has no appeal even to a longtime fan of Sweet's work. The late tempo change, feeble anthemic ending, and indulgent, poorly chosen, overly loud steel drums in the first track give you an early indication of just how many things go wrong with this album."
3,"Good, but not his best","I've been a fan of Sweet even before the Girlfriend album (which I still think is his best), and this one has some fantastic songs on it, but overall, I still don't think it ranks up there among his best. Even the last one, Kimi-Ga-Suki is better. Still worth buying, but not essential unless you're a longtime fan like me."
2,Very disappointing to say the least,"I am a huge Matthew Sweet fan, but this album doesn't make the grade. The music just feels lifeless and there isn't one song on here that caught me with the usual Matthew Sweet ""hooks"". I have seen Matthew play several times, I own every stitch of material he has ever released and consider him a ""pop"" music genius, but I seriously doubt this one will ever make it to the CD player drawer again."
4,Under My Skin,"QUESTIONS...Does this album break any new ground for him? Not really.Are the songs a little too long and ragged? Yeah, maybe there's a little too much jamming...a little editing might have helped.BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY...Is it packed with the hooks, melodies, harmonies and sentiment that make Matthew Sweet one of the great pop-songwriters of the post-rock era? OH YEAH...As with all Matthew Sweet albums, the melodies have been sneaking up on me...not leaving my head...until another one takes over.Matthew Sweet is a GREAT tunesmith...plain and simple...and this is a solid effort."
3,Altered Bees-t - Part 2?,"""Living Things"" reminded me a lot of 1993's ""Altered Beast"" where Matthew threw everyone who loved the tight Power Pop of ""Girlfriend"" a curve with moodier and more experimental material. It took me awhile to get to know ""Beast's"" charms and it looks like ""Living Things"" may be the same way.There are some fine songs and melodies here but sometimes the spur-of-the-moment arrangements get in the way or bury the hook. This approach works great for short 3-4 minute Power Pop songs that can be easily bashed out, as on the great ""Kimi Ga Suki Raifu"". But for this kind of experimental material I wish Matthew and company had rehearsed a little more before he hit the ""record"" button. Many of the songs go over the 5 minute mark and could have used some editing or eariler fades. Some sound like rough demos.Like Todd Rundgren, Matthew's at his best when he reins in his experimental tendencies and shoots for the good old-fashioned pop song. This rambling CD could have used a few of them."
1,leaked,"The faucet literally sprayed out the back against the wall. The inside O-ring had a large defect in it, and I had to go purchase an O-ring at a hardware store to keep from damaging my kitchen."
4,return to form for Paddy,"I don't pretend to know what Paddy McAloon's life has been like in recent years; I can say that I Trawl the Megahertz has found him, musically, in fine form. From the opening (title) track, with its found poem narrative (from a guest female vocalist), to the rest of the mostly instrumental album (Paddy only sings on ""Sleeping Rough"" - an apparent nod to Rip Van Winkle), McAloon has dipped back into his love for early 20th Century American pop music; a modern marriage of his polished style with Gil Evans-era Miles Davis."
3,Smoke at his best.,"There is everything that you would expect from the ""Mountain Man"" series in this one. Good verses evil with an lot of gun-fighting and a few good fist fights. Smoke always gives the bad guy a chance to change his evil ways; if he don't then lookout. Smoke's niece, Jenny, finds herself in a bad situation on her ranch that her Mom, that's right Smoke's Sister Janey, left her in the mountains of Montana. Sally Jensen is along on this adventure too and you can expect anything in your belly from her, from a piece of fresh apple pie and coffee to a 44 slug from her six-shooter or short carbine. So sit down and have some fun with this one; it's a fast read."
3,Missing Info,"This book is missing info about the control and equipment. How to cable the home is one thing, to make it all work is another, it's better to spend money on a contractor."
1,huge mistake,"The one person who reviewed this item gave it a bad review but being an optimist and since it was what I wanted it, I ordered it. It is the most worthless piece of equipment and I think Amazon should no longer carry such a defective item. I doubt I could get my money back but a word to potential buyer-BEWARE."
1,are you kidding,"How can anyone claim to have the greatest instrumentals and not have included the greatest of all of them - ""Rumble"" by ""El Maestro"" -Link Wray; There is nothing by the master - whose instrumentals are legend."
4,the secret,it was a good movie and inspirational is what I remember. I did enjoy it and will watch it again.
4,"Great, but not their best","Many Lifetimes is a great CD by an underappreciated band. This CD has different, less urban, rhythms than their previous album, the superb ""Soulfish"". It lacks the distorted guitar riffs of David Gilmore, however(at least I think he's the one providing them on other Lost Tribe albums), which makes ""Many Lifetimes"" a beautiful, smooth, but at times predictable album. Nevertheless, a 'must have' for jazz and fusion-fans. Too bad Amazon doesn't deliver the ""Soulfish"" and ""Lost Tribe""-albums."
4,"""Y"" Is a Good Thing","This is a good connector for a DC system. Not a complicated piece, but a very good one. The ends were all 3"" , the hose fit snuggly and the wire clamps held.When making a branch in the DC system, to go to several different pieces of equipment, the ""Y"" connection is better to use than the ""T"". The Y will allow for a better air flow. Combine the Y with a/several blast gates, then it's almost like having a single hose go to each piece of equipment."
3,problem with packaging,"Our order was sent in several different shipments.When we received some of it, the boxes of staples were shipped ina larger box and the smaller boxes had broken open.It would be good if it would be packaged better next time."
2,Disappointing,"This album was nowhere near his past works. The released singles (Fa Ru Xue, Yue Qu) were not impressive at all. If you want an introduction to Jay Chou, buy Qi Li Xiang or his debut album. There was also not a song that blew me away. In his debut, there was ""Ke Ai Nu Ren."" In Fantasy, there was ""An Jing."" In Qi Li Xiang, there was the title song."
5,The perfect book for a child!!!,My children absolutely LOVE this book!!! It is so worn from use that we almost need to get a new one. My oldest daughter read it so many times when she was younger that she had it memorized and could read it to us word for word before she could even read. It is a wonderful book that teaches that they are special and that God loves them!
3,The Best of Shirelles,This CD album is just great. Not one of them is hard to listen to. They are all unforgettable-especially Soldier Boy! Well worth buying!
2,Muy apenitas...,"La guitarra está muy apenitas. Inmediatamente te das cuenta de que no fue una buena compra. Claro que si el guitarrista es un chamaco, pues entonces la exigencia no es tanta. Sin embargo, yo hubiera preferido mejor compara otra cosa. Por cierto, el amplificador falló al poco tiempo. El cable era tan chafo que hacía tierra constantemente, por lo que tuve que comprar otro. Si quieren comprar una guitarra de este tipo, mejor vayan a una juguetería y véanla físicamente, pruébenla y luego cómprenla."
2,Very much Christian literature,"This starts as a compelling story of a young boy all alone on a remote ranch in the Colorado territory, struggling to take care of the ranch and his comatose grandfather. There were some nice elements to this story; the characters were beautifully developed and the setting and situation made for a great read. But in the second half, the warm, feel good Christmas story I was expecting turned into Bible quotes and preaching. With all respect and no offense intended to Christian readers, I was disappointed that the beautiful, lyrical story I was reading became proselytizing. That's okay but not what I want when reading fiction."
3,"Simple, light story from 1942","I got this for my children because I remembered it from my childhood. Set in NY in the 40's, a captain of a barge keeps a mostly collection of animals on the east river. One day the animals take the boat out alone, get shipwrecked rescued and celebration ensues. Charming rendering of NY City in the 1940's. Interesting historical references / backdrop. Mild ethnic stereotypes (Italian grocer,etc)"
3,Some classic essays but dated,"This little volume has some classic essays- Judith Jarvis Thompson's famous ""violinist"" essay and Michael Tooley's defense of infanticide are both here. Both are still well worth reading, though to my mind Tooley's essay has aged better. There is still something to get out out Thompson's paper, but the fact that it was written (as all of these were) in the early 70's shows more in hers. John Finnis does what he always does- give an argument that you must be a Catholic to accept and then claim that it's self-evidently true. Very annoying. While it's worth while to read the essays by Tooley and Thompson, it might be better over-all to get a more up-to-date volume."
4,"Not perfect, but satisfying","If you're looking for action-packed or lots of blood, this isn't the film for you. There are a few mostly useless ""scream-inducing cat jumping out at the protagonist"" type moments.I watched on Instant Video, so none of the awkward editing mentioned by another reviewer. The Caller is a slow-paced thriller, very reminiscent of some of Hitchcock's works. It does require that you think to enjoy the story."
3,The Caller dark with some suspense,"I love thrillers in the month of October. The Caller was interesting, filled with unantisipated suspense. The quality of the film was dark and left the viewer with frustration as to what was being shown in the film. Overall worth watching in view of other thrillers."
4,Creepy slow paced thriller,Excellent film very Hitchcock vibe. Love the setting of san juan PR. The voice on the phone is just chilling..Like Norman Bates mother only way more damaged. The part with the chicken frying gave me nightmares.worth watching
1,At first it's just boring....then it becomes downright dull,"I hate the thought that I actually spent money and time on this movie. It was awful. The plot was interesting, which is why I rented it, but where there might have been some suspense, some interesting, scary moments - there was well, nothing. Just dull, plodding nothing. Wish I'd never fallen for this plot synopsis."
1,Hang up!,"Don't waste your time on this- nothing scary about it except for the dark, ugly apartment she lives in. Uninteresting characters, plot makes absolutely no sense...just an extremely bad movie!"
3,Rachelle and the others,"I was prepared for a film starring Rachelle and Moyer but it was 95% Rachelle and 5% everybody else including Moyer. That said, she kept my interest, though the film became a total downer by the end. The love scene: very edited and dark; and the next day they didn't even kiss in the morning? Very little chemistry between Rachelle and Moyer."
1,I invested in eight dollars for my weekly best friends movie night. I PAID EIGHT dollars to view...sickening.,I am so upset that I spent eight dollars to watch a horrid movie with my best friend and I value our movie night. It was one the worst movies I have ever seen. Being a valued customer I feel I should recieve compensation for the tortmeting expiernece.
4,good for price,"it is good for price,but it is not comfortble,if you use it over half hour,and it is not a headset for listen to musics."
4,More about learning,"Learning is one of my passions. Over the years I have seen a number of references to Leclercq's book and then I read it. In the Middle Ages (Eleventh century and beyond) learning happened in two social contexts: monastery and school. Leclercq focuses on the monastery, where the monks learned in order to praise God and live devout lives. To pray they had be be able to read the scriptures and other texts - both Christian and classical. What they read and prayed about prompted them to write their own expositions. The more famous of these are ones by Bernard of Clairvaux, Anselm and a few others. In general, the monks had little interest in abstract or conceptual learning; they left this to those teaching at the schools. Overall, Leclercq clearly and thoughtfully describes the learning at the monasteries, which influence later Western thought. The Middle Ages were not as ""dark"" as we sometimes think they were."
2,More needs to be offered to justify this price.,"I was amazed when I saw the listed price. Nearly $60 for 13 episodes? Even with the Amazon discount, it is still over $50. This equates to around $100 for an entire series, which is the price range of a few years ago, when the quality of the video was higher, the packaging was more appealing, and there were many more extras. Currently, quite a few 25-26 episode series can be picked up for between $40 and $50, and yet, today, we are being asked to pay nearly double that when much less in terms of quality, packaging, and extras are being offered in compensation. If the fast food service of the anime industry thinks it can charge for gourmet fare, they have not seriously sampled their own service.And why, oh why, did Funi once again alter an opening sequence? The original was much more appealing! Why can't this company just deliver a series without re-editing, re-writing, and doing their utmost to neuter an otherwise creative television series?"
5,Deep and Thoughtful,"One of the best books I've ever read-- deep, meaty, poetic, and contemplative. Need to read it again to escape into the prose and ponder each word of poetry."
2,Missed it by that much.,"Robert over thought the 70 weeks of Daniel it was right in his face, he didn't need to do all his math.Daniel 9:26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. Messiah was crucified/cut off for the world at 62 weeks, right there in scripture."
4,In depth and articulate...arguably too articulate,"A little ""wordy"". The writer is the type who will impresswith his vocabulary and sentence structure ability...if youdon't choke it up before finishing the book.Still, great in depth prophecy analysis."
5,Top Pick,"The Fanfare Want List 2006Jennifer Koh's ""Portraits"" presents three top-notch performances of extremely challenging repertoire. Szymanowski's Violin Concerto No. 1 has for years been near the top of my shortlist of favorite concertos for that instrument. Koh's purity of intonation, the sumptuous sound of her high position e-string-playing, her ability to float an unbroken legato for pages at a time, and her razor clean articulation are in a class of their own. The less-recorded Martinu's Second Violin concerto goes in similar fashion, but with a keen understanding that Martinu's sound world is of a completely different nature. It is realized vividly, especially his bucolic second themes. In the Bartok Two Portraits, Koh et al. successfully realize a third sound world. The result is a third musical home run.By William Zagorski"
1,Stanley 20-045 15-Inch Fat Max Hand Saw,"Have owned this saw since 12/07 and used two or three times, am totaly unimpressed with it. imho my bow saw probably works as well or better. Purchessed this because of all the exellent reviews. must not be holding my mouth right, But this saw does not work for me!"
5,Handy Thing To Have,"I got this because I wanted a little saw to use for things that I could not use a power saw on. It rips right through composite railings, 2x4s and tree limbs. It cuts on push and pull and fast! A good choice for any homeowner."
5,Great Bargain,"I wanted this saw for occasional use. I read the reviews and gave it a try. The price was great, the shipping fast, but best of all this saw gets the job done with little effort ... exactly what I was looking for. It has coarse teeth so it won't crosscut smoothly but I use it for ripping also. It has a comfortable handle so I don't really see any negatives associated with this tool. I'm very well satisfied with the Stanley Fat Max Saw and can't say enough about the service that Amazon.com provides."
5,Excellent,"This book is an excellent book to help the reader beginning to learn the depth of the Hebrew words in our scriptures. The author does a great job of keeping it simple enough for those of us who do not yet know Hebrew, but have an interest. If you are seeking to grow closer to God and want to know and understand more of His character, this is an excellent tool."
3,Not much there,I guess I expected more than what was in this book. Could've been an article on the internet. There was very little substance there.
5,Excellent Book,"I learned a good deal from this book. I particularly liked how he addressed the mistranslations in modern day biblical text and exposed some of the more popular but ignorant modern day views. I think his intentions are genuine and that is more than I can say for some preachers and so called teachers. Jeff's book seems to bring light to the hebrew perspective and I respect the fact that he encourages study and cross referencing of material to dismantle bias. I am awaiting his lexicon. I sincerely hope that the Lord blesses him in his endeavors and he is able to truthfully share. And yes, I am a Christian!!!Leo Williams"
5,A 'Must have it 'if learning Biblical Hebrew,"In spite of its rather coarse presentation, this book is an eye opening experience when learning biblical Hebrew. Benner explains in a simple way what theologists and other adepts do not tell us about the sacred names of God, making us want to delve deeper and deeper, be it the culture, the Hebrew language or Kabbalah. His explanations and examples are cristal clear, even if one doesn't have any previous knowledge about Semitic languages. Now, The Bible, when reading a compared version (Hebrew-English) makes much more sense than before. Excellent work."
5,"Truly, the Habraic meaning takes us deeper in God!","I would like to thank the author for this wonderful work which helped me better understand the covenant relationship and the name Shepherd along with other names. In particular I would highlight the meaning of the commendment ""thou shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain"",it is not just saying the name in vain, it is actually not representing His character in vain, since we are made in His image and His likeness and thus His character must be represented. This truth changes everything because we must show Him to the people, and when we don't we thus violate this very commandment.God bless you all."
4,The NexStar User's Guide,"If you own a Celestron NexStar telescope and you are not ""GoTo"" savvylike most of us, this book will walk you through it and then some.I have the SLT 102, which is not covered in this book because the three SLTmodels are new and did not come to market until after this book waspublished. Nevertheless, it does cover the former models which operatealmost identically. I had no problem following his explanations ofoperating my scope. There are many tips and illustrations on the NexStarline of scopes to give you the confidence needed to get the most outof your investment. There are trouble shooting guides, suggested acessories,software reccomendations, power sources, and what you can see in the skywith your scope. The author has a web site for the most recent informationand tips on the NexStars. You will never feel like you are alone. Mr. Swansonwill answer your questions directly or via the Yahoo NexStar newsgrouppages. It is a good investment and resource for your telescope."
1,out of date,"I bought this with NexStar 6SE which is not covered in the book. I know most of the contents still applies to mine. However, you can find most of the information from internet, as the book says. It's time for the author to revise it to make the 2nd edition."
2,Dept of Redundancy department,This is essentially a regurgitation of the owner'e pamphlet. and a rehash of fundamentals of Astronomy....total waste of $$$
3,Good but very very dated,"The content of the book may be relevant and useful if you own or are interested in any of the older model Celestron telescopes discussed. Unfortunately the material is dated and I couldn't immediately find any coverage of telescopes in Celestron's current productline (May 2010). I wanted to use the book to help me learn about Celestron's current offerings and also to help me decide on what to buy but it ended up being a chore trying to match the new and current products to those covered in the book either by name, features and capabilities. So I gave up and returned the book.If you are interested in older Celestron telescope models, the book may be of value to you. If you have some familiarity with Celestron's goto telescopes, you could probably figure out and benefit from the book by applying the content to current models. The book may have a potential and will serve interested buyers well if the author and publisher releases an updated edition."
3,The NexStar User's Guide,"An excellent book because of the care and thoroughness with which it was written. However, so many new products and improved models have been developed since the book was written, I only gave it an average rating. Otherwise, I would rate it with all five stars."
4,NexStar bible,"A terrific resource jock full of insights on the NexStar line of scopes. Some of the material not exactly applies to my scope (NextStar 8 SE), e.g., no need to align scope per book's somewhat tortuous guidance, as the manual with the scope is straightforward. Still a worthwhile purchase especially for first time scope owner and book has many useful web source references."
3,Lionel Train Station Lamp,The lamp is very nice although it is primarily made of plastic which was surprising to me. When you hit on/off button the train moves around the base with train sounds and shortly after complete circle it turns lamp off. You can turn sound off with a switch in back of the base. My son loves this lamp.
3,"Good, with a short life","very nice product, but I bought this as a replacement for one that lasted only 9 months, with minimum use"
1,Waste of money,I was expecting something totally different. Read it in about 20 minutes and couldn't believe I had paid for it.
2,I broke it out of frustration with the fence,"It's noisy, but it works OK in a tight space, like my condo in Cambridge. The fence sticks and it's impossible to get straight, and then it moves and the tiles bind. I yanked it off and in the process I broke one end (it's poly something or other and thinly made so it was easy) I went to MK looking for parts and they provide a list of distributors. ..$12.00 for the fence (OK) $14.00 for the shipping (thanks a pant load). What I'm gonna do is bend a piece of steel to go around and catch the groove that runs along the back. It's not worth it to me to buy another saw. You could also draw a line on the tile and cut by eye but that's a nuisance if you have a lot of similar cuts."
1,this is nice for a toy,"On the very first tile I cut, the motor caught fire. I did not bind the blade or overheat it. What a great tool (not). Only recommended if you want to roast marshmallows or as a toy for a wanna-be handyman."
1,Infuriated,"I ordered this tile saw in the spring and am just now getting around to using it. As I was putting it together, I discovered that the tile guide, which is made of plastic, is broken. I have no way of guiding the tiles and cannot believe the guide was broken when being taken out of the box or during shipping. I am now going to have to go to Lowe's to purchase a saw, as I do not that the time to send this one back or to order a replacement piece. Disgusted."
3,"Will this tile saw work for 12"" ceremic tiles?","Will this small tile saw cut 12"" tiles? How easy it is if it can?I may have 1500 sq ft of tiles to cut for my basement project."
4,good little saw,"We're in the middle of a complete bathroom remodel right now and bought this saw for the job. It did a great job cutting 2"" hex marble floor tiles. We're now using it on 3x6"" wall field tile and it is making nice clean straight cuts. The fence adjustment tends to get clogged with tile dust and fragments pretty quickly, which makes adjustment difficult, but a quick hose-down of the saw fixes this. This is the case for most saws of this type/price range, of which I've used several. This saw is as good or better than all the others in the $75-$125 price range."
5,Can't beat the price.,"Nice small good looking tile cutter.Very easy to use for small jobs, I don't think it will last for big or professional jobs though...."
4,Great (but slow) for the money,"Everyone that has previously reviewed this saw has covered the bases (both good and bad).Cleaning: When I was cutting 12x12x1/2 slate, I had to refill the reservior and clean the workspace every 2 or 3 cuts. I also had to clean the entire thing every 5-8 cuts. And yes, use it outside...but who would really want to use a wet saw in a nice indoor application? :)Motor: I only bound it up 2 or 3 times over 40 cuts, but I know as a first-timer I was definately not trying to rush the job. Other than that, it cut clean and true.Price: I borrowed this saw from a friend to do my slate job, but I think it is perfect for a DIYer, so I'm buying one for myself. For a small job, or a take-your-time DIY person, this is a great saw. I'd hate to rent a bigger saw, knowing I was paying by the hour I would probably screw up more cuts than I already did on my own!"
4,MK Diamond-good saw for the $,I have performed numerous tile jobs with commercial saws. For the money the MK gets the job done. I have used it on 2 small bathrooms and it has performed well. The only negative comment is the water run-off. You have to fill the resivoir back up after every cut because most of the water runs off the tile and not back into the grooves around the base. This was with 13inch tile. Smaller tiles (8inch) would not have this problem.
2,Brittle plastic parts won't last,"While this is a functional basic wet-saw, it has a number of drawbacks:1. The fence is poorly designed and manufactured - the tabs broke off in the first week of use. Cheap Chinese crap plastic and poor industrial design.2. The blade will only cut ""soft"" clay tile - don't even try to cut porcelain.3. Limited to cuts under 8"" because of the way the fence is attached.4. Hard to find this size of replacement blade,Next time I would pay more and buy a 7"" wet saw with the motor and blade above a sliding table."
2,Not all that it's cracked up to be!,"The first thing I noticed after assembling the saw was that the motor was loose causing the saw blade to wobble. I had a deadloine to complete a small project so I didn""t have time to return the itme and wait for another...who knows if the next one would have the same problem. The fence is practically useless. It's nearly impossible to adjust the fence to your desired cut and then tighten the fence and not watch it move. I ended up not even using the fence. Very time consuming!! Also, I'm not sure if this is the saw's fault or the cheap tile I used but at the end of every cut the tile would chip rendering one peice useless. But hey...I guess you get what you pay for!"
2,Bad Buy,"Don't buy this saw! Despite slowly feeding the tiles so as not to overtax the small motor the motor on this saw burned up after cutting less than a dozen 1/4"" floor tiles."
3,Product Not As Pictured,The Octagon Clock I received had black face hands not gold as pictured. The black against the green felt background was impossible to see unless you were right on top of the clock. I bought some white paint and after painting the hands I can now see the time across the room. Also there is no hanger on the back of the clock and very little place to attach one (This doesn't sit up on a table by itself either). I was able to attach a picture hanger across the back at the top but had to be careful not to split the wood. After a few improvements the clock is fine but definitely not ready to use when received.
4,A valued book for my favorite film,"After 20 odd years of studying this film over and over (at least 25 viewings), I was glad to find Sanderson's book filled with pictures and interesting commentary, although he seems to skirt over the film's considerable suggestion of Jungian concepts about synchronicity, etc. He does make a firm case for DON'T LOOK NOW being one of the best films about grief and grieving ever made, and,moreover, uncovers its gothic text intelligently. Not highbrow in any sense, just thorough and smart, and good reading to boot! It's also great to have a list of the opening and ending sequences in this shot by shot format, since there's never been a montage anything like Roeg's jewel created since 1973."
3,Leaves me wanting more,"I bought this cd at Starbucks, thinking it was a greatest hits. I bought it without looking too closely, for it has some very obvious omissions.While it is a good overview of his work, it concentrates on his earlier work, and leaves out some other compelling works. This would seem to be an ideal cd if only it had What'd I Say? and Georgia On My Mind. With those glaring omissions, this an above average cd at best. However, with the exception of Cinncinati Kid, it has some strong matieral, so it isn't a complete waste of my money."
1,What History?!,"Very weak in my opinion, especially regarding the historical Jesus. He does not touch on any of the purported historical evidence of Christ outside of the Bilbe. I did not see mention of any of the following ""outside of the Bible"" historical sources for Christ's existence:Josephus The Talmud Pliny the Younger Tacitus Suetonius Thallus Phlegon Mara Bar-Serapion Lucian HadrianIf you're going to discuss the history of Christ in a fair and balanced approach, you need to address the outside of the Bible sources.To me it almost seems like the author didn't dig too deep for fear that he might find something that would not agree with his vision.Save your money, check it out from the library!"
2,A Limited Effort,"You can come to any conclusion if you carefully omit the pieces of information that conflict with your intended outcome. That's what this book does. It's a good read if you're seeking to reinforce the comfort found in your beliefs. The author states that the virgin birth story is too weird to have been made up, yet virgin birth stories already existed at the time the biblical one was written (the stories of Apollonius of Tyana, Krishna and Mithras to name a few). Evidence clearly suggests that Christianity ""borrowed"" these concepts from much older religions. This type of information was omitted from this work, making it, in my view a very narrow study."
2,Tried to be too 'scholarly',"A great subject. Lot's of good information. Dry as dust. Skip the first 70 pages... they amount to an excuse for writing the book. I don't understand how such an exciting subject could be presented with so little spark. Some pictures would not have hurt, either. The U.S. News article by the same author was better."
2,Too Conservative,The parts on the bible codes and Dead Sea Scrolls were good. Otherwise author favored conservative views excessively. It seems there wasn't a conservative position he didn't agree with. He wasn't critical enough. As an example consider his treatment of the book of Joshua. He said the archeological evidence seems not to agree with the book of Joshua about the destruction of Jericho. Then he said that the evidence seems to support the conquest happening about 1250BC. Evidence of destruction of Hazor fits with that time. Then he says new evidence seems to support the destruction of Jericho in 1450BC. He doesn't see or at least doesn't emphasize that this conflicts with the other 1250BC evidence. The author doesn't mention lack of evidence like no record of eqyptian artifacts carried in by the arriving Isrealites.
1,Great films ruined by hideous musical scores,"These Buster Keaton classics, ""The General"" and ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" are two of my most favorite films in the world. My viewing experience for both were shell-shocked by the wacked out scores by the Alloy Orchestra on this DVD. The experience was like having a hammer being repeatedly smashed into my brain. There are several GOOD versions of these two masterpieces out there, and I hope everyone buys one. But these disgraceful versions are not among them."
5,"Buy it, Buy it Now!",The General is a great movie. The Prints are the best I seen for this movie. Alloy Orchestra is the best. The Chugging sound fits in good. In Steamboat Bill Junior Buster Keaton does a stunt where a two ton wall falls on him but he goes right through the window.Buy It!
5,Keaton is great,Laughs come in bunches. Keaton gets in and out of many situations and a lot of action. Recommend viewing for all Keaton and silent film fans.
4,"Great product, messy shipping","Product was great and easy to use, but the shipping envelope it came in was beat up, as was the box and the plastic holder of the heart rate monitor. It was almost embarrassing to give as a gift."
5,Another great Montana Mavericks story,"I really enjoyed this story. Leanne Harding was the misunderstood, but tough heroine. Her older brother, Rand and her fiance, Bill never quites listens to what she says. They don't hear her hopes and dreams for the future as well as her feelings. Cade Redstone never has that problems. While he might not completely understand why Leanne has run from her wedding he is willing to give her the time to sort out her feelings. When Rand and Bill, start to pressure Leanne Cade comes up with a solution. His temporary solution, to give Leanne time to think about what she wants to do, gives Leanne the breathing room she needs. Both are falling love with each other but can't tell the other of their true feelings. In the end they come together. A meeting of minds, goals, and love."
3,A great companion to the Red Sox Hall of Fame induction.,"Although the book reads like a laundry list of quotes and anecdotes gathered over the last 12 - 15 years, the book reveals a goodly amount of information. The writer does a hard job at not being biased against any one person or event in the life of Jackie Jensen. Though the union of Jackie Jensen and Zoe Ann Olsen did not produce another pro or Olympic athlete, the children have gone on to be happy and successful in their lives in their own ways with the future of their grandchildren still wide open. I would have liked to have seen this documented by the writer. The story reads as if it was a failed generation. Not at all like the reality."
5,A most wonderful conversation,"I first read this book in the 1970's when it was new. I've owned a copy ever since, and I've given so many away as gifts that I've lost count.It is easily my favorite book. From the moment I first read it, until today; I open its pages and feel as if I'm having a literary conversation with an old friend.The ""moral"" in the title puts off some folks, but don't be deterred. Gardner uses the term ""moral"" as you or I would use the word ""truth."" All Gardner is imploring is that authors seek the truth when writing fiction and avoid cheap tricks and cheap effects. That is all.Yes, Gardner did feel that writing comes with a responsibility. He also felt it was nothing less than a privilege, and thus comes the responsibility that goes with privilege.Buy it, enjoy it. If you share Gardner's view (as illustrated in the paragraph above, I promise you -- you will cherish this volume)."
3,Back to the old days,"After the commercial failure of ""Real"", Belinda Carlisle returns to somewhat familiar territory with this album, which has the same slick production feel of her first three solo records. That's not a bad thing, just a safe one. Still, ""In Too Deep"" ranks as one of her best records, and the album contains other great songs too(""Listen to Love"", ""Love in the Key of C"").It's remains a travesty that she can't get any airplay here in the states--though she's always been accused of being slick, who can argue that her most hook-filled songs are miles ahead of the teen boy/girl band phase that America is going through now?"
5,WHAT A WOMAN from her MAN!,"Belinda Carlisle has such a wonderful appeal. Her selections here certainly bring her back to the ""Runaway Horses"" era with catchy melodies and breathtaking harmonies & vocals. IN TOO DEEP is fantastic,and if you are an avid fan, she sings a great version of Roxy Music's ""Jealous Guy"" and ""The Ballad of Lucy Jordan"" which were both released on the singles of In Too Deep and Always... respectively. Buy this album! Look forward to her new song ""SYMPHONY OF LONELINESS AND HEARTACHE"" to be released about now!!!!"
3,musicaly - nice. but an averege DTS production...,a Nice rock albom. If you like Belinda's singing.The mix is too crouded. Sometimes it seems like instruments are overloading eatch other. and the overal sound quality sounds like it's all synthisized sounds. not live like in Sting's DTS CDs.If you like Belinda - buy it. If you're looking for a good DTS demonstration - skip this one.
1,"The Slamming of ""Real""","I am really surprised to see how many people referred to Belinda's ""Real"" album in their critique of this album. Real is an amazing piece of work that doesn't deserve the lambasting it's getting in these reviews. The album was heralded upon its release as a treat for all those fans who loved the Go-Gos's feel of Belinda's style. While I think her debut solo album still rates as her best effort, Real is in second place for her most accomplished work to date. Each song is different and explores so many areas. The HIT single ""Big Scary Animals"" ranks as one of my favorite songs. Listen to it again guys/gals, I think maybe, if you get today's overproduced generic music out of your systems first, Real will take a bite of you, and won't let go!"
2,"""A Woman And A Man"" pitiful and vapid","I love Belinda and I can honestly say this is the one CD of hers you can, without ever missing a thing, leave out of your collection. There are a few good songs (like the wonderful ""Kneel At Your Feet""), but overall it feels like Belinda trying to do an impression of Wilson Phillips. If you want a terrific CD by this artist, pick up the artistic ""Real,"" her best work to date, or ""Runaway Horses,"" which features Belinda's best song ""Summer Rain."""
4,Make a difference!,"I replaced my old O2 sensor with this new Bosch 13957 3 Wire O2 Sensor. Change my idle at first, but get better gas mileage now!"
4,Good book,"I collect insects around my region and I had no idea what they were. I bought this book and now have names for about 94% of them. The only thing that disturbs me about this book is that scientific names are not offered and the ordering of insects isn't reflective of scholarly knowledge. For example, they have insects commonly known as ""stink bugs"" in the category of ""beetle"" even though these two insects are of a completely different order. Overall, it's a great book and I'm glad I purchased it."
5,Feel Fabulous in the Buff,"I love this book. Laure writes with honesty and frank discussion about ""body hate,"" a distressing emotion that we've all encountered at some time during our lives.Laure used to be fat, but she overcame her problems with eating and is now a respected fitness and life-style expert. Her recommendations are simple and easy to follow. Drink lots of water. Treat yourself. Sit up straight. Exercise for 10 minutes a day. In all, there are 10 steps in her program. Nothing is grueling or so difficult that a regular woman (or man!) couldn't handle it.I'm planning on buying this book for my sister and my mom.Give it a try for 8 weeks, and I promise you'll feel better about your body."
5,A must read for mothers and daughters,"Feel Good Naked should be a must read for every adolecent girl and her mother. I got this book for my two college age daughters, but I wished they had read it when female body hatred begins in middle school. Laure has a realistic and positive approach to self acceptance and self love. Thank you for writing it! Now, my 30-something girlfriends are reading it. Delenee Brugman, Author of Happily Wed and Happily Fed."
3,interesting title,lots of fun tips... builds self-esteem while reading... cant tell if effects are lasting. hopefully they are.
5,Hasn't anyone read this incredible book?,"Does anyone remember Omar Tipton, the soldier with the cleft palate, face down in the woods, injured, sucking in wet dirt and leaves? This book prompted me to visit Antietam!"
3,A good movie in its own right,"Lacks a lot of the look and feel of the original ""Carry On"" films, but then again those movies were all personality-driven to a large degree. Nevertheless, I'm glad I saw it. Especially funny was the bit where they met the ""Americans"" (get the SPECIAL gold we give visitors).Funnier than most of the stuff being produced nowadays!"
1,UTTER RUBBISH,"Do not buy this, it is utter utter utter rubbish, made on the back of the original Carry On's years later, this would have the original cast turning in their graves. It is British comedy at its worst, the script is just full of old one liners which we've heard all before, innuendo which is just crude and not even funny. This film should not be associated at all with the Carry On name and should never have seen the light of day. The sad thing is that the film stars many of UK's biggest commedy acts such as Julian Clarey, but he must have been scrapping the barrel to star in this. Nil point from me."
2,Make Your Own for Pennies on the Dollar,"Have used this product for years with great success; HOWEVER, buy Miracle-Gro Water Storing Crystals and make your own. Exact same active ingredient minus the Ca and other minerals but your herp's diet should be taking care of this or you can dust with supplements. You will cry when you see how cheap it is to make your own."
3,Basic read,"Basic story with average characters. Decent book without anything to write in depth about.I was disappointed with the lack of humor that was supposed to be in the story. I also dislike it when authors wrap a mystery with information that was not shared in the process of the book. While I was able to surmise most of the story line while reading, there was simply too much stuff to fill in the gaps at the end that wasn't in the book.This review is based on the book and the audiobook with George Guidall narrating for Recorded Books."
4,"Good, but not the best Gideon Oliver novel by A.E.","A fine author. I just felt this one fell a little flat for me personally. I enjoyed some of Julie's revelations toward the solution. And as always, I enjoyed Professor Oliver's inspection of the bones and time spent along those lines. Joly was fun. But this one wasn't my favorite. The institute characters were dull and annoying. I think I liked Twenty Blue Devils better for teaching me about the coffee farming business, and that one, IMHO, had a more interesting, and satisfying, ending. I just finished GOOD BLOOD (#9?) and LOVED that one. For a good mystery, I also enjoy authors Elizabeth Peters, Anne Perry, David Lindsey, and Nancy Atherton."
4,Typical With a Good Twist,"This is typical of the series. The characters are fine to spend time with, the puzzle grows more complex and there are nice twists related to bones. Unfortunately some questions of who did what are not dealt with succesfully. But all in all it's a good read. On a related note, I would like to see more of the author's wife's series on golf."
5,A pleasure to read,"I wanted to wait a few days after I got this book to read it because I knew that if it was a good one, it would only take a day to read - and it only took a day. My house is a mess, but I spent a very enjoyable day with my nose stuck in this book, and it was nice to revisit some old friends in this latest Gideon Oliver book. I highly recommend it."
4,A review of Aaron Elkins' SKELETON DANCE,"Aaron Elkins has written another enjoyable Gideon Oliver mystery. Anyone who enjoys richly detailled exotic settings and an unusual assortment of clues to puzzle over will enjoy this book. The author regales the reader with lovely descriptions of pastoral France as well as some pretty intriguing anthropological data (e.g. the current new twists on an old debate about the human qualities of the Cro Magnon vs. the Neanderthal add color to the central conflict of this mystery). Unfortunately, the dialogue between characters in SKELETON DANCE is not as witty and smooth as in earlier books of the series. Since Elkins relies primarily on dialogue to flesh out his characters, the book suffers a bit in this regard. Still, as the season of lazy afternoons is almost upon us, the book is a good addition to any bach bag or picnic pack."
3,"Gideon Returns, But Not Triumphant","I was ecstatic when learned in February that a new Gideon Oliver mystery was about to be released. As the previous reviewer states, however, this is not as good as Elkins' earlier books. This is much better than Twenty Blue Devils, but the characters are primarily painted through their conversations, and I grew tired of how many people said ""um, hmmm,"" etc. In his earlier Gideon Oliver novels there was much less dialogue, and thus better stories. Old Bones and Dead Man's Hearts still stand out in this series. If you love the series, read this one; if you've not yet been hooked by Gideon's discovery of murder through bones, start with an earlier title and come back for this one when it hits paperback."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book is poorly written. Nothing happens that is very exciting or unexpected and the ending is just drivel. Most of it is boring and I guess lifelike, and some elements are just far too far-fetched to be believable. The setting is the only redeeming feature of the book. I read it all to see how it came out and it just never got better and I feel like I really wasted my time. I came here to review it so you don't waste yours to read it. I guess the good part here is that I'm inspired to write a work of fiction."
1,Boring and without focus,"I found the book dry and the characters boring. Carrie Debary was the heroine--and I use the word loosely. There was nothing heroic about Carrie's behavior. Her husband, Alex was involved in a boating accident, which left him paralyzed, and instead of watching out for her husband, CArrie was contemplating having an affair with the man that worked for her and her husband.Carrie was so low-class with no redeeming qualities. While her husband was in a convalescent home, trying to regain the use of his legs, Carrie was running around on a motorcycle with a man she had the hots for, and drinking beer. There was a scene that showed Carrie drinking these men under the table. She was just terrible, as was the book. It was just too descriptive, and the dialogue was lifeless"
4,Does whatis says it does,This product does exactly what it says it does. But to my surprise it does even a little more. I thought it would just paint the scalp but the colored powder actually attaches to the hair strands making them appear thicker. Very cheap. and effective.
1,TOO SMALL!!!,Item says it fits most cars. IT LIES!!! DOES NOT FIT CHRYSLER 300!!!!!!!!!! bought this for my boyfriend but IT DOES NOT FIT!!! Logo is small too. UGGH!! So much for THAT christmas present.
2,Poor Quality Product,"I have had this chair for 1 week and am very dissappointed in its quality and comfort. This chair is made in China, the assembly instructions were all pictorial and very difficult to understand. The manufacturing tolerences were very poor with over a half inch gap between the back of the chair and the seat. The bolt connecting the back rest to the main mechanism pulled out due to bad threading. (The bolt was supplied by the manufacturer). The inserts that go in to the metal tubing fell out and were improperly installed by the manufacturer. The gliding mechanism has a clicking sound when used.Overall I would not recommend this product."
1,Roy Rogers-Grand Canyon Trail,Still waiting for this item---have sent updates that still want this item---hope to see it soon
4,Great for Senior BB forms!,Grand Master Kim has helped perpetuate he art with his work. This video was very helpful to me.Kam sam ham ni-dah
4,Good,"The video is well made, you can see the sequences from every angles and the esecutioner is very skillful. To give five stars I'd like to see the application of the techniques behind the forms."
2,Disappointed that it was not up to date,"I buy alot of travel guides and I was disappointed after purchasing this one. Because it was published in 1999, I thought it would be up to date, but it was woefully inadequate. For example, the growing area of the so-called ""Maya Rivera,"" for which I was particularly interested, is not current with the majority of resorts there. Also, I didn't feel Cancun was adequately covered.Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Frommers (Fodor's too was not very current either), but I was very disappointed in this purchase."
1,Have they been to Cancun this decade?,"Complaints about this book:1. The book recommends ""Restaurant Los Almendros"" as a good place to eat. One of the two locations isn't even there anymore, and the other one was some of the least impressive food from my whole trip.2. Scarcely a mention of what turned out to be the best attraction in the whole region, Isla Contoy.3. I wonder when the authors last visited; the advice given about having to ask for your check at a restaurant seems out of touch. I never once had to ask my entire visit.4. The book should be called ""The Yucatan."" Cancun and Cozumel do not get enough coverage to justify their prominence in the title."
1,Diamond MK100 Tile Saw,"Home Depot rents the Diamond tile saws, one model up from this one so assumed that if they are good enough for rental and associated heavy use its right for me. The saw arrived and we immediately found that the reset button which is located on the motor fell right into the motor and was not attached to the housing. I returned it without trying it. Amazon wants you to pay postage and they will refund it due to being defective. Well, this big and heavy box was UPS $120 to ship. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a return label, much better idea! They get far better rates. In conclusion, the saw probably is ideal, just not this one. I got a Ridgid instead, cheaper and miter's and is great!"
2,MK Diamond MK-100 tile saw,"You would think that MK Diamond would have the table alignment down pat by now, but they don't. We couldn't even get the center grove in the table lined up with the saw blade while keeping the back of the table at a 90 deg. to the saw blade. Table bearings are very poor quality, won't hold lubrication for more than 10 minutes making it very hard to push table when sawing tile. The 45 Deg cutting attachment that comes with the saw is useless because of its ill fit on the table. Forget this saw spend a little more money and go buy yourself a DeWalt tile saw even if it's a refurbished one. I am very dissatisfied with this saw."
1,Good saw for the money only if the motor works.,"For $600.00 it is a good quality saw if the motor works. Unfortunately after the seventh project in a year and a half, the motor quit. I just got word that a replacement will cost me $425.00. The repair will be $250 to $300 if the parts can be located. The problem with the repair is that all the parts necessary are not readily available.Don't waste your money on the Hot Dog blade if you are cutting large pieces. It is too thin and has a mind of its own. Your cuts will not be straight."
5,Canon Printer,So far any of the procedures I've used I have been well pleased with the results. I would recommend this product highly for the home photo processing.
3,Just a toy! Not for anyone over 6 yrs old.,"This is strictly a toy for children 6 and younger. Very light pull, not a strong bow. Rubber suction cups make it fun and safe for youngsters.I have a 7 year old granddaughter who really hunts, and I wanted a real bow. Not bad quality for the price."
1,Didn't hold up,"I bought this as a birthday present for my 9 year old nephew. The first time he went to use the bow, it broke. The good news is the company refunded our money immediately and were very accommodating. Now we just have to find another brand that won't break!"
2,It was ok for a half of a day.,My son was so excited when he got his box. But was not happy with the product. He is a special boy and he expects his stuff to work and if it doesn't he is mad. The string does not stay on it so he can't shoot the arrows so it went in the trash the same day.
5,Great on chrome rims and logos,"I've used this on my chrome rims as well as front and rear chrome logos. The results are very good. Now obviously if the parts you are trying to polish are already worn out for instance for scratches, you cannot expect miracles. My rims for instance have some scratches as my car is 5 years old. So on them, you could only see partial improvements. But the logos, that are not scratched, are visibly more shiny than before."
3,Avaerage!!,"I bought this product for my car but the chrome areas were worn down so bad that this product could not bring the shine back, however on those areas where the chrome was good intact, it worked well."
5,Not a documentary,"First and foremost this film is not a documentary on the life of Princess Kai'ulani nor is it a documentary on the overthrow of Hawaii. Instead it is a touching story based on truths about her life, her exile to England and the struggles of a 17 year old teenage Princess losing her kingdom. Upon returning home to Hawaii she must make the choice between true love or the love of her homeland and fellow Hawaiians.I felt that Q'orianka Kilcher did a great job portraying Princess Kai'ulani in this film. The films supporting actors such as Barry Pepper as Thurston, Will Patton as Dole were also very good. I highly recommend this film to everyone!"
3,Read The Book,I read the book and the true history of Hawaii. I will tell you now the movie left out key points and it was truly a disappointment and a waste of my money.The book is truly better than what was filmed.
4,American Shame,"A very good presentation of how a peaceful, literate, and progressive society was destroyed by self-serving American citizens using the military forces of the United States to overthrow a non-violent and non-discrimanatory nation. It is a shame never to be forgotten and has resulted in a strong undercurrent of now found prejudice. I only wish this film would get major play throughout the United States so people can see how evil the off-spring of missionaries became."
2,Awkward and Uncomfortable,"The movie overall was a 6 out of 10 stars. Being 22 years old and being hawaiian myself. I felt very uncomfortable with the movie. I do want to let you know that my family in Fact has royalties from my great-great grandmothers side. In the movie there was a lot of kissing which in fact back in the day, the true hawaiian look down on public affections because it was disrespectful. The first half of the movie was boring. It only got good when Princess Kaiulani came back to the Hawaiian Island was when it was getting good. Hopefully when they make King Kamehameha as a movie they will do a better job portraying the story!"
1,Won't play on Region 1 DVD players (United States),Even though this DVD is supposedly coded for Region 0 (All) it doesn't work in my Sony DVP-NS315 coded for Region 1 (the United States) or on the DVD player in my computer. The DVD was manufactured in Argentina (I was execting it to be from the UK).I was originally waiting for the U.S. version but it was never released on the date published (October '05) and now is simply listed as unavailable. Nice way for the American music industry to treat one of the true founding fathers of rock-n-roll.Too bad...Buddy is awesome and the content would be great if I could view it!!!
5,Pretty cool!,"This is a real science book (so it takes some brains to read), so it is not for everyone. But, I thought it was cool because the content was diverse, balanced, and not hyped. It is pricey, but it is priced like textbooks. The best source there is!"
4,Nice phone for the money,"I've had this phone for a few weeks now and love it. It looks sharp (like a black RAZR), but not many people have this. I got it because it was cheap and different. It has Cingular Video and high speed data (3G, but only in certain large areas). Good battery life and clarity. Loud speaker phone, blue tooth. Cool camera too, seems like a nice, durable phone.Cons:It doesn't allow you to change to soft keys. The phone ring type ascends only, you cannot change this. Seems like the voice of the person you are talking to also ascends slightly. The alarm doesn't have volume controls, but I don't use that anyway. There are a few minor user interface flaws, but overall a great phone. I would recommend it."
1,"If You Want A Toy Get This, If You Want A Phone Stay Away","I've owned Samsung phones for the past few years and I thought I was getting a heck of a deal with this LG phone but all I got was a stupid toy. You can do a lot of stuff with it like load music, create cool ringtones, etc. but the one thing that it doesn't do is give you clear reception. People can never hear you because you. You've seen that commercial where the guy talks to that girl and half way through she can't hear him, well that's exactly what will happen to you with this phone. Worse decision I ever made buying this phone. I should have stuck with Samsung! Beware buyers, you'll want to toss it out your window."
2,worst phone ever,"this phone is by far the worst phone i have ever purchased. the guy at the cingular store recomended it to me and now since iam out of the 30-day return gap, they wont switch me a new phone. the phone has horrible reception and it always drops my calls, compared to my mom's nokia from the 90's which has perfect reception."
4,finally happy with cingular,"pretty cool phone, having problems sending msgs sometimes due to lack of reception at my home, but definitely the nicest phone i have had. i like the reversible camera but cant get it to zoom, still need to buy the cable and memory card. battery dies within 2 days but im always either on the phone or texting, or on the internet, which is also very fast and works great. overall a nice phone for the money, even though i had to upgrade my data plan to get the special price."
2,No cables for connection,"not a bad phone, but if you want to move files to your phone, and photos back to your computer. I have had other phones, and they came with a cable for making transfers to my PC. This should be standard with any phone that plays MP3s, but LG insists that you buy their software at addictional costs, and the cable too. I refuse to do this, so in order to move my files, I have to remove the battery, YES, remove the battery to access the memory card. Then remove the card and plug into my all-in-one card reader. This works fine, but not really worth it for just a few pics. In hindsight, I would have went with a different phone, but was not given much choice, since this was a warranty exchange from cingular."
3,"basic needs met, advanced features expected","the phone's clear, feels good, neat features. it still doesn't support address book syncing with any software so i haven't bought the cable yet. also the battery drains way to fast, if i leave the phone on and maybe make one or 2 short calls it is dained within a day. i can not find larger batteries anywhere yet either. i subscribed to cingular video and xm radio on it and it's great! make sure you get unlimited bandwidth or else you're going to pay hundreds! :P they had an error on my statement i needed fixed and had to call 2 months in a row now since they didn't get it right yet."
1,junk,"Been using this phone for about 10 months now:- The speaker is too quiet to hear without putting it up to your ear- You will get ""service unavailable"" often, even though you have bars, though you still get notified of new voicemails- After ""service unavailable"" you are taken back to the main screen, where you can start fishing all over- The center button takes you to the internet, where you get charged by the KB- You will be charged for internet even if you request an internet block- Cingular will sign you up for roadside assistance without your appoval- The discussion group on Cingular's site has thousands of trouble tickets- The micro sd chips aren't recognized by the phone- etc."
3,Quite Enjoyable,"I really liked this book. The plot may not be the most practical, but I was quite drawn into the story. This is not a book for someone who loves historical fiction, but it isn't a science fiction or romance novel. If you've read other Victoria Holt books, and liked them, I would very much recommend The Shivering Sands. Enjoy."
3,"Great shop helper, BUT",This clamp and the face frame clamps are the idea tool for clamping. They are light easy to work with and you can work on one joint at a time without fighting a bar or pipe clamp. The problems come with the design. I have snaped two right at the throat of the threaded end. That was tighting only hand tight. Iam not a hulk of a man so be careful in tighting. Otherwise I would give this clamp and its brother the face clamp 5 plus stars
4,Another great one by chomsky,"Another excellent book by chomsky.Two of the main recuring themes in this book are dependence on capitalism on the state through various subsidies and control. Ranging from early US protectionism, IMF planning of many third world economies and how even the most 'laisez faire' nations have all had enourmous regulation. Such as chile under pinochet.Espicially good are the chapters on cuba and the third worldazation of south america.A book no one should go without reading."
1,"If you're looking for something that won't rust, don't buy this.","I used this martini shaker once, rinsed it, but did not dry it. A couple of days later it had rust in the bottom. It is also very hard to open when cold."
2,Rust,Purchased this item and ran it through the dishwasher prior to using it and the bottom of the shaker and the top of the cap both rusted.
4,"Good, but not the best.","Item was as described, although it leaves a bit to be desired as a cocktail shaker. First off, no leaks! I wish the inside of the cap had measurement lines (1 oz, 2 oz, etc.). The lip of the strainer cap doesnt protrude out so you have to be careful how you pour it or you will get a big mess. Hard to open when cold, as mentioned in previous reviews. Still, for a guy on a budget who wants to shake his cocktails in style, It works just fine."
2,Difficult to close,"It is very difficult to close in order to shake, when I put liquid in it and tried to close it always spills"
2,Hard to open,The lid is hard to get off and it don't shut all the way! I was very disappointed! Not worth the money
1,Hope that you can get it open,Be suprised if you can open the cocktail shaker. It is not commercial grade as with commercial grade you do not need a crow bar to open it.
1,Mine is a Leaker - Beware,"First, the good: The shaker comes well packaged and looks attractive. The capacity is good and it sits with stability on flat surfaces. Unfortunately, mine leaks profusely. Not only does the shaker spray liquid everywhere while shaking, it also dribbles from the perimeter sleeve when pouring. In short, expect a mess. The problem might be attributable to a slight warm in the middle sleeve (from which is intended to remin on when you pour). This might be unique to one particular sample, but the metal seems very thin and therefore vulnerable to warps. This item is touted as commercial grade, but no bar would use this item more than once. I am not waiting to check the reports of rust. This is going back."
3,Cocktail Shaker,"Not the strongest of stainless stell, however the finish on the product is very good, product does the job. Can't complain."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS--WASTE OF MONEY,By far the worst shaker I have ever used. The top is impossible to take off without spilling the drink everywhere. Feels cheap and flimsy. Waste of money. I'm buying a replacement immediately. Please do not buy this--it is worth paying an extra 10 dollars for a shaker that works
3,Useless for Pouring,"Nice size but my first clue was when I removed the top after shaking, the liquid cascaded down the sides of the shaker. Then bad goes to worse when you try and pour from it. I will attempt to return and buy something with a lip that will pour.One week later. The size is very nice and it does not leak when you shake it. It's possible to pour but you have to dump it upside down all at once. It has a very comfortable and user friendly shape and weight. It works and for the price, I'm liking it."
3,Not the best,"This is ok, but you will probably need a tutor. My Romanian tutor found this book to be very difficult for someone with no experience with Romanian. It also lacked exercises until the end of the book. I feel there was alot of useless vocab and grammer (ie ""fairytale"" grammer). If you are just travelling to Romania, don't worry, most people under the age of 35 will know at least some English. If you are serious about learning Romanian, this book is useful."
1,Useless,"The Kindle version drops all accented Romanian characters in the text, making it impossible to pronounce and learn the words correctly. In the scanned paradigms the accents are there, but the type is so small as to be illegible, and cannot be enlarged."
2,So disappointed...,"I was so excited to get this book and start on the task of learning some Romanian. However, I found it to be very unhelpful. There is almost no guidance on the tapes for pronounciation. The book does provide useful vocabulary and grammar lessons, but what good are they if no one will understand you when you speak?"
3,A decent album that needs polish,"Frankly I was a little bit dissappointed with this. There are some good songs on here but some of her lyrics need work and some of the beats seemed out of place. Not to mention her voice is annoying too. That being said, there are still some good songs on here like the lead single ""Gettin Some"" and some good guest spots and production but I would only recommend this to Shawnna or DTP fans."
1,All garbage doesn't sell,"In today's rap market the hot commodities are the albums that have the most materialism, disrespect to women, and ""gangsta fairytales"". Well Shawnna's album has all of the above and her sales are poor. So what does that say for Shawnna. She can't even sell in a market that caters to commercial BS!!!!!! This album is garbage, Shawnna is chi-town garbage and needs to find a new occupation. I suggest her finding either the nearest strip club (since she is from the chi I suggest Arnie's in Harvey!) or find the nearest porn studio for a more productive career."
3,Raw,"This is a good CD. Tight beats and good lyrics. But, sometimes, the beats in the songs overshadows Shawnna's raps and also the other rappers featured in some of the songs ""steal"" the song away from her or the song ends up being ""too much"" including them. She has skill and she has talent, don't get me wrong but, a lot of the songs on this CD tend to blend together due to the fact that the majority of the songs on here sound a lot alike. A lot of the same bassy beats and background shouts.Standout out tracks:""Gettin' Some"" (Remix)""Damn""""Block Music (Bang)""If you are already a fan of Shawnna, I think you will be satisfied with this CD. If you don't know much of her previous material, I would just stick to to songs that she is featured in."
4,finest!,this is some hip-hop at its best!shawnna has what it takes to get flowin on these tracks!!highly recommended stuff here!check it out and please your ears!you will have a good time!
5,Like discovering a classic,"I was especially fascinated by Claudel's handling of the theme of murder during a time of war (WWI): on a gut level it's a perfectly crafted who-dunnit, with an amazing twist. The policeman who narrates the story thinks he's a pretty sharp judge of human nature, but he learns a thing or two not just about his neighbors but ultimately about himself, as he tries to solve the murder of little girl while the sons of the nation are being slaughtered at the front near his town. Ultimately he finds you can't completely uncover anyone's nature, not even your own. This is such an interesting book and such a beatifully told story--like discovering a classic--I want all my friends to read it so we can discuss. You'll be thinking about these characters long after you put the book down. Held me from start to finish. Bravo!"
3,Easy Writer: pocket reference,"Its a pocket guide, what else you wanna know about it? it got me through my class. ! ! !"
1,Not my cup of tea,"I purchased this album several years ago and ,as today, I can't sit to hear the whole thing. I admit there some nice orchestration here and there but every piece is a protest song or some kind of social comment. I want music to move me, not to lecture me. This album is so dense that I don't feel the salsa vibe it needs. Salsa music is about fun, dance, etc. I really missed his flavor on earlier albums like ""Siembra"" and such. Even those albums contained some social content but they were very enjoyable."
4,Buena musica,"Aqui Ruben demuestra de nuevo todo su talento como canta autor. Diversifica su repertorio saliendo del genero tropical, componiendo y ejecutando magistralmente toda clase de musica. Hay que tener en cuenta que este no es un disco bailable, ni de musica que vas a oir en la radio. Como muchas de sus canciones, es para sentarse a escuchar la letra y musica, y no es popular con los djs. El tipo es un maestro y un orgullo para Panama. No mas falta que viviera lo que predica en sus canciones, pero, quien este libre de pecado.... Espero por nuestro bien que NO VUELVA a ensuciarse con la politica y que siga produciendo buena musica."
5,One of the Best album's of the century.,"Sin duda alguna, Ruben Blades ha demostrado ser el mejor ""poeta"" de la musica latina. Definitivamente, este CD ha sobrepasado cualquier otro en su categoria, se lo recomiendo a todos aquellos que tienen un gusto selectivo en la musica latina. La letra de sus canciones son Absolutamente Increibles!!! Este artista si que no tiene pelos en la lengua para describir la realidad de nuestra America."
5,This music is transporting,"I've been a Ruben fan for many, many years, but this CD has floored me! The new musicians, Editus, are not necessarily an improvement...it would be difficult to improve on Oscar Hernandez, Robby Amin and company, but they lend a completely new sound to Ruben's vocals. ""Dia a Dia"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard in a very long time, but it's only icing on the cake for a diverse, intelligent, romantic collection of songs. AND THE LINER NOTES AND LYRICS ARE IN ESPANOL! It's about time! Ruben, you're the best!"
5,Ruben Blades's musical manifesto..,"By accident I saw Ruben Blades perform for the first time on a PBS television show called ""Sessions on West 54th"". Immediately after the show I ordered his latest CD ""Tiempos"". Though I can barely speak ten words of spanish, I believe this CD will both amaze and entrance you by the beauty and complexity of every track. The supporting musicians who call themselves ""Editus"" are also incredible and could one day become bigger than the Gypsy Kings! I'm sorry Mr. Blades didn't win the election for the Presidency of Panama, but his political loss is our musical gain. Thank you Senor Blades for an unbelivable work of art!!!"
1,Totally Overpriced Chinese Item,"You must be kidding me! 30+ bucks for this cable? Total joke! I just bought a Monster Cable (item no. DVI400-2M) which is a top-notch DVI cable for less than 20 bucks. Don't buy this crappy cable, buy a Monster Cable instead if you want a high-end quality cable or spend less than 5 bucks for another brand with the same quality/specs of this Dayton DVI cable."
3,"No libretto, mono sound","I agree with the comments about the cast, singing, etc., but I was disappointed that there was no libretto included. If this is important to you, look for another recording. Also, the sound seems to be mono. I also bought another opera on this label (Opera D'oro), with the same problems. The price is great, but in this case, you get what you pay for."
4,great bag,"I love it, perfect for me. Very comfortable while I do not look like a school kid when taking this to a business meeting. Wish the front flap had a little bit of Velcro though."
2,Not as good,"Old Songs --- Just not as good as the first one. His last 2 cd's really [stunk]. Try again next time, Louie."
2,"Wow, Im never listening to this CD again","Im really upset to have been so excited when i purchased this CD to wanting to throw it out the window. The songs chosen for this CD are just not hot enough. The only songs that make the CD keepworthy are numbers 1 and 2 and maybe even the mariah carey song. The drunkenmonkey song makes me mad because it is not appealing at all. Actually it samples eminems song ""Without Me"" but its still wack. Dont purchase this album. The first dance factory is way better."
3,"great treatment of complex subjects, but would be better if more recent updates were available.","This is an increasingly relevant topic as markets become more internationalized. Particularly with the passage and implementation of Dodd-Frank legislation, with its extraterritorial application, this is a subject that requires frequent updates. However, it is to be expected that those most interested in this subject will be monitoring developments from the government agencies involved. It serves as a great primer for events before the 2008 financial crisis.Once Dodd-Frank is more fully implemented, it will be more possible to update the materials frequently. Given the depth of coverage, updated material will be very helpful to market practitioners."
4,"Great advice, nothing too complicated","I bought this book years ago, imagine my surprise to see it here (and in the free section no less).This is a great book that contains rules for writers. It's common sense good advice and it's in a simple numbered format so it's easy to read and remember.How-to books on writing can be so convoluted and complicated so it's nice to have something like this around."
1,disapointing,"Henckels should work at least like the rest. They don't come apart.. so you can not clean between blades... :( disapointing.. otherwise, they do work well, but this is a basic requirement for sheers. I should have read carefully I guess..."
3,"Great blades, weak handles","We have had these scissors for a couple of years. The blades have stayed sharp, but a crack that soon developed in one handle finally broke all the way through today, leaving them useless. We never used them to do messy chores because the blades do not separate (The Fiskars scissors get used then). We will buy a different type next time."
3,Shears do not come apart for washing,"I love kitchen shears, and my last pair died. I bought these because the brand is well known. They cut everything just fine, but they do not come apart for washing like the other pairs I have owned. Sad."
3,does the job,"expected better quality from the Henckels name, but cant complain too much as the blades cut well and seem to keep there edge, i hate the ugly cheap plastic handles, for not just its cheapness but also the fact that it doesn't match any of my other Henckels cutlery."
5,State of Mind is my State of Mind!,I play this CD all day. Waiting All My Life is so very touching. A great wedding song classic to be.
5,Great!,"I haven't been as excited about an album in a long, long time as I've been with ""State Of Mind"". This is really a great album by a great artist. Good songwriting, great performance and a new fresh sound - simple as that! Words can't describe! Really!Any music lover will love this album. Get it! NOW!"
3,Pretty Good debut,I enjoyed hearing Raul Midon's guitar playing&tone. I enjoy how He blends styles of R&B mixed with latin&other flavors in his Music. I feel that the sky could be the limit for him if he keeps on forward.this is a Pretty Good start. I enjoy His arrangements.
5,Intense listening experience,"This CD is by far the best ever. The simple lyrics and intricate eclectic musicianship make for one amazing CD. If you need something to relax, pop this one in and click repeat."
4,Wow,"Great stuff here. I'd prefer the album to be live as Midon is an incredible performer and some of this magic isn't easily translated into this album, however, it was well worth it. I can't wait for his next one!"
3,Midon offers a satisfying debut release,"I saw Raul Midon on Letterman when he performed ""State of Mind"". I was very impressed with his performance and ordered the album without hearing any other songs. ""State of Mind"" remains my favorite song on the album, but the other tracks are just as good in their own right. Track 2, ""If You're Gonna Leave"" takes a turn towards the R&B; part of the specturm. ""Keep on Hoping"" is a catchy little tune with a fun little bouncy melody. ""Sittin' in the Middle"" is a fun song with a very flowing guitar accompaniment. ""Sunshine"" is the kind of song you listen to on a summer drive across country. The other tracks stick to a more R&B; flavor, which I don't prefer, but they could hold their own in that genre. Midon shows his mastery over his instrument, not to mention he is blind.Overall: a good listen."
3,Southwestern Soul,"Midon first nationwide release displays and individual and welcome change of pace from most other pop artists. I believe he released one self produced CD prior to this. Best described as a cross between Stevie Wonder (who makes an appearance on the CD) and Jose Feliciano he displays both vocal and intrumental prowess. His writing is very good, but still heavily relies on Stevie's influence, which is not a bad thing. A very enjoyable effort with a bare bones production by the infamous Arif Mardin to allow for Midon's talents to shine. There are no drum machines, computer driven synths, or excessive overdubs to cloud the listeners perception of this major talent. There is defintely a wealth of talent here with room to grow."
3,Raul Midon,The lyrics are good but I found the acoustic guitar dominated tracks to start to all sound the same after about track #5.Be OK if you made a compliation CD and stuck him in about every 10th song.
2,Only One Hit,The first song is really the only good song. It has it moments here and there but overall not worth the purchase.
5,Blown Away!,Wow! Raul Midon is a modern day Stevie Wonder - A true musician filled with raw talent. I was lucky to catch his live performance on comcast OnDemand; I was speechless! This kind of talent does not come along everyday. I look forward to seeing one of his live shows.
5,Stunning!,"I too have just watched his perfomance on the Letterman Show, and in the 6 or 7 years that I have been watching it, I dont remember sitting up from my bed in pure disbelief of what was going on. I was just sitting there, thinking: ""this cant get any better"", and then the ""trumpet"" solo started. Thank god my DVR got it all, so I can endure the couple of days before this CD gets here :-)"
4,music for the soul,Raul Midon is a tremendous guitar playing monster that infuses r&b style with latin style. The man has a incredible voice that at times reminds you of Stevie Wonder(who appears on the album for a harmonica solo). I find this to be a very soulful album that can put you at piece when needing to relax.
5,Bread and Butter,"This album is a must have for any dinner with friends, romance or time to yourself for some serious R & R. It should be shelved next to Paolo Conte, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles. Enjoy."
5,Music Virtuoso doesn't dissappoint,"We saw Raul on tour with Jason Mraz last summer, and he INSTANTLY won us over!His percussion/guitar/vocal/trumpet ""one-man-banding"" manages to stay nearly undetectible, and avoids being gimmicky. His lyrics are bright, and uplifting, and his voice delivers them with strength and passion.A must-buy!"
5,Buy this CD!,"Raul is my favorite new artist, my boyfriend gave me the cd for our anniversary after seeing someone else buy it and I'm so thankful that he did!! After listening once I was hooked w/ all of the tracks. Quickly after that I looked up Raul's website and found out he was going to be in my city in a few weeks and I instantly bought tickets to the show. Raul's cd is amazing, but boy seeing him in person was even more amazing!!! You don't realize just how much on the cd is all him until you see him live in front of you. The cd is a perfect blend of r&b;/soul/latin/reggae. I honestly love all of the tracks, although I will say I'm partial to Waited All My Life since it's a song I hope to use at my wedding some day.Please check out this cd and suggest it to all of your friends - I know I am and I'd love to see Raul get more attention because he deserves it."
5,Discover Your Bliss,"I had the happy accident of encountering Raul Midon at the Vienna Jazz Festival. Simply put, buy this album and you too will discover a wonderful talent about to breakout bigtime."
5,Umm Wow!,"I heard ""If You're Gonna Leave"" on the radio and I was highly interested in the artist. After some good searching I found out a Raul Midon did it and his album was out. All I can say is wow! I was at a lost for words (in a good way). It has great tracks and it's consistent in it's quality. If he gets promoted more he could really be big amoung those looking for quality smooth r&b."
5,Remarkable and depressing,This film is very effective in portraying what I imagine was an utterly horrible time in history. And it really is all thanks to Adrien Brody who was utter perfection in this. He never overdid it and his performace was gut wrenching. Everybody should see this movie. Words can't really give it justice.
4,One of the greatest Holocaust movies,"I purchased this DVD without first seeing the movie in theaters, and I knew from the reviews I read I wouldn't be disappointed. This is a classic masterpiece of one man's struggle against the inhumanity of the Nazis of world war II Germany. Adrien Brody's portrayal of Polish pianist Wladislaw Szpilman is both beautiful and nuanced. Nothing overdone. Although I wouldn't rank this as high as Schindler's List (as some have done), it's definitely one of the finest of the Holocaust movies ever made."
5,Highly Recommend,The depiction of how the Jewish were treated brings out empathetic feelings for those who suffered through the experience. It leaves one wondering how such atrocities could have really happened. The strength and determination of the human spirit to survive through such deprivation is awe inspiring. The movie is long but worth it. This true story based movie is excellent.
2,not Speilberg,"A good movie about WWII Poland and a view inside the Warsaw ghetto, the movie is an interesting journey of a man who spent most of the war locked in rooms evading the Germans.The problem is that the movie spans the entire war, leaving me disconnected emotionally with the principal character. The leaps of months and months in time were boldly displayed throughout the movie. In the end, only two things could have truely made this an epic emotional picture: a) Steven Speilberg should have finished the movie in his sytlistic dramatic fashion, or b) the character should have been mistakenly been shot by Polish troops thinking he was German.Neither the stunningly impressive scenery of war time nor the drama of dead bodies being walked around in the streets were not enough to promote this film past two stars."
2,Boring protagonist,"This film's story is potentially moving, but rendered rather boring by Adrien Brody's uncaring and mushy performance of its protagonist. As the plot dragged on, I kept asking why I should care about the sufferings and torments of this man who didn't seem to care himself what happened to him. No matter what happens, Brody's reaction is always a bland, disinterested smirk that becomes more and more irritating. Too bad: the story deserved a better presentation."
3,Very Much Overrated,"No doubt this is a good picture, though too long and often boring. Undoubtedly this movie is not material to win the Academy Awards it won. There were far better movies (directors and actors) during 2002. Just for example, there is no comparison between Nicholson's performance in About Schmidt and Brody's in The Pianist: Nicholson should have won the AA hands down!! And, it is amazing that every few years Hollywood has to remind us of the Holocaust and reward the makers of such movies (particularly in this one) with Academy Awards they don't deserve."
2,More proof that the Oscars are a total crock!,"Even though I'm simply echoing stuff that a lot of other negative reviewers have said, I feel I must help counter all the mysteriously great reviews this film got! Adrien Brody TOTALLY didn't deserve the Oscar for this -- hell, he hardly even has any lines, and spends most of the movie hiding like a rat, with an expressionless face, watching Nazi atrocities out of his window! And (though this is not Brody's fault) his character is totally unsympathetic and cares for no one but himself. All the Nazi brutalities have been shown ad nauseam in other, far-better movies like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Life is Beautiful."" As someone else said, I think this movie (and Brody) did well because 1) it's a Polanski film (whoopee), and 2) it's about a politically correct subject. Frankly, I don't need any more movies about the Holocaust unless they have something new to say about it -- and this film definitely doesn't."
2,Very disappointing,"This was one of the most disappointing movies I have seen in a long time. The events that it portrayed are horrible and tragic, but the movie and its presentation of the events were severely lacking considering the awards it was given and the huge budget that it must have taken to make the movie. There was nothing that has not already been said repeatedly from Hollywood, and the movie spent more time highlighting bloody scenes than any sort of plot line. I realize that it is unpopular to say that anything portraying the Holocaust is not magnificent, but this movie was tragically lacking in anything like substance or quality.In my opinion, if you've seen ANY other Holocaust movie in the last 10 years, save your money and the 2 1/2 hours for a movie that has something new to say and says it with intelligence."
1,"Good movie, defective DVD","Universal Widescreen, will not play through, but stops at ch. 13.I have seen the film, which is excellent, but am very disappointed at the poor quality of the disk, which will not finish playing, even on a brand-new Sony DVD player."
1,DVD HD (High Definition),"Please be aware that when you sell a CD that the customer should be able to use it. I dont know anybody who has a player which can process a DVD HD. My understanding is that the ""Blue Ray"" is the next generation of DVD and not HD DVD which was not accepted as a standard. In my case I returned the first DVD as it would not play. I received a second DVD with the same result. I threw it in a corner and forgot about it.The Pianist [HD DVD]"
1,Don't toss your money on this one!,We purchased the DVD based on the many claims that the moviewas a terrific addition to the world of entertainment. Yet wewere very disappointed with this predictable piece of pseudo-drama. There were a few highlights giving credit towhy Adrien Brody is off to a great career. But the story andpicture quality...not worth a third of the money. Skip this one.
2,Cowardly,"To the Michigan reviewer. What the heck does this mean? ""Or are you really that narrow-minded that nobody suffers like us?""I have No Clue as to what you are talking about. Be concise.The movie is well acted & directed. The fact that the story is true sickens me.If I find the movie boring due to the pianist's lack of backbone, that is my right. I do not hold well with spineless acquiescence nor willfull brutality.The mere fact that you enjoyed it seems to vilify your own sense of right and wrong. The entire movie imputes flight rather than fight. Wrong, wrong, wrong!National treasure? National coward!"
4,feels authentic,"A movie that makes you feel like you are realy living in 1940's poland because everything seems and feels authentic. Admittedly, not as good a movie as Schindler's list or even Europa Europa. But even though not as good, those movies felt like they were a bit over dramatized for effect (for a good purpose mind you). If you are a history buff, or one that questions what actually happened during WWII, perhaps this film will help you get a clearer picture of what actually happened (yes I know this is just a movie, but it is based on a person's real life experiences).I would like to see more movies like this. Not only that of jewish experience during WWII, but also that of all participants of the war and done in a realistic manner, with real people's stories and experiences."
5,Must see,True story of both the pianist and the German captain who saved him at the end. We should not forget these lessons.
1,Never received item.,I would not recommend buying from a private source through Amazon as I did with this used DVD. It never showed up.
1,The Pianist,"Supposed to be NEW! Had circular scratches on it upon opening. Would not play. DVD player gave message - ""Disc damaged or dirty""."
5,Excellent Tape,Played well. One of the best (although heart-wrenching) movies I've ever seen. It should be a must for everyone to see.
4,Excellent,I would like to give a 4 1/2 Star it keep my attention the whole movie! I will keep looking at it many times
4,Thought provoking,"The Pianist is one of those movies which holds your attention every minute. I was nearly afraid to see what was to happen next all through the film ! I ordered an extra copy of the film to lend to my family and friends so that they could experience some of the horrors which had taken place when Hitler began his goal to take over the world.A plus in the film was the excellent piano playing which for me was tear jerking. I don't suggest The Pianist for the younger folk without adult supervision, but for those who have heard anything about the events during the holocaust in Europe, this movie will help to realize just what occurred during during that period !!"
5,Humanity is still there,This DVD i was searching for last so many days and afterall got it from amazon.com. It's a very very good movie. What a brilliant acting and a true story too! After seeing this dark movie I came to conclusion that humanity is still there.
5,Ignore the morons and watch this film.,"Ignore the reviewers who call this film ""dull"" or ""boring"" or ""overlong""; they're obviously the kind of people who think Will & Grace is the height of comedy.Ignore the ones who claim Schindler's List is better; Polanski's film goes way beyond Spielberg's sugary tale.Most of all, ignore the beer-swilling, NASCAR-loving rednecks who claim Brody's character is a coward. They must have thought this film had lots of explosions and guns."
2,"Technical Excellence, Uninspired Story","Stories of the holocaust need to be interesting. After all, who wants to spend their recreational time reliving one of the worst atrocities in history?The Pianist puts a very personal face on the Nazi occupation of Warsaw, and walks the viewer through the struggle for survival of one man and his family. This interesting perspective should bring something fresh to a topic that isn't very appealing, yet has been relentlessly overdone by Hollywood.But it doesn't. The story isn't terribly interesting, though the unique hero perspective this movie chooses should be fertile for a new treatment of the subject. We don't get any additional insight, and are treated to countless acts of violence hung over a thready plot.I distracted myself with the movie's excellent cinematography, editing, and music. It's sad that I spent the time watching the movie for its technical qualities instead of its story, but I found the story to be less than enthralling."
2,"Nothing New, Liked SCHINDLER'S LIST Better","This film is competently made, even very involving in the beginning, but the disappearance of the Pianist's entire family so early on and endless shots of him staring out of various windows made me think there was a more interesting story going on elsewhere.It would have had a much more profound effect if I'd never seen SCHINDLER'S LIST, Steven Spielberg's best ""adult"" masterpiece, but I kept comparing the atrocities of this film's color scenes of horror with Spielberg's black-and-white ones and had to go with SCHINDLER every time.I've always loved what Polanski did with THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS, ROSEMARY'S BABY and especially CHINATOWN, but I've been scratching my head since then with efforts like FRANTIC, BITTER MOON and THE NINTH GATE.THE PIANIST is one of his great films told at the pace of one of his bad films.Sorry."
1,freeze/jump problems on widescreen version,"I bought the widescreen DVD of The Pianist at Circuit City and it froze and jumped within chapter 13. I got a replacement copy and it played fine until near the end when the German officer shows up and then it jumped back to chapter 13. I played the DVD's on different players, different brands. Don't know if it is a widespread problem or related to Circuit City's batch. (The movie itself is 5 stars, I'm only reviewing the DVD.)"
4,Brilliant,"I loved this movie, an epic saga of human endurance and sacrifice.The HD DVD video quality is probably the best I've seen and the audio quality was excellent also.The story itself was tremendous, in the nature of Schindlers list, but not quite as moving or as hard hitting as that movie. The main actors ineptitude and lethargy at times was frustrating, but it is a true story, and remarkable none the less.Great entertainment and well worth the small purchase price, this is a movie that will be played several more times over the years.My wife, 13 year old son and 10 year old daughter enjoyed it also, I highly recommend it."
2,No English Subtitles!,"The movie was great, I enjoyed it so much in the theaters that I bought it when the DVD came out. But I was so disappointed to find out that there is NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES in this DVD (3-disc special edition, Canada), only French subtitles. It may be trivial to others, but it's something that I want and think should be standard in the DVD."
5,One of the best movies ever.,"This is one of the best movies out there. Completely deserving of the 3 Academy Awards it won (Best Actor, Best Director, & Best Screenplay).If you like old war movies, with high drama, and a great story, this is a good movie for you. It is a long movie, but worth the watch."
4,"A thought-provoking, moving film.","It's hard to understand how human beings can be so cruel. Indiscriminately murdering, beating those who are helpless, and tearing families apart are scenes in this movie that are impossible to forget. Roman Polanski doesn't shy away from the reality of what went on. And, of course, it was undoubtedly much worse than what we see in this movie (which is bad enough).This is an excellent movie. Even though it is long, the storyline moves along well and keeps you interested. As I watched it I couldn't help but think, ""How could this happen?"" But it did and the violence such as you see here continues to go on in various places around the world -- just not to this extent."
5,A must own,I purchased the StudioCanal version of the movie almost 4 months ago. The video and audio quality are superb on top of a masterpiece of a movie. Roman Polanski's masterpiece. The higher priced StudioCanal version may have been out earlier but the expense was worth it. You will not go wrong with The Pianist. Get it today!!!
2,I might be the only person who didn't liked this one...,"I usually love Polansky, but this movie for me was the story of someone who survived. I mean if I wanted to show the horrors of the war and how jewish suffered in Polan, I'd rather do a documentary.There are some very good aspects of the movie...I liked the music, ilumination and shooting, but not the story.For me is a story not special in any way, it just shows how some guy can be lucky enough and survive in a very hostile enviroment."
2,Dull,"I realize it is fashionable to rave about this film, but I found it dull. It is well acted and well photographed, but the Brody character is just not very interesting. This guy escapes the holocaust through the efforts of a series of other people, does very little to help himself other than scrounge for food, does essentially nothing to save others and shows little gratitude towards the people who help him. There are seemingly endless scenes of Brody sleeping or staring out a window. This is a yawner. There must be a lot of politics behind all the awards this film got."
5,wow,"this is a very good movie, that i think everyone one in the world should watch, i am so in love with the movie!"
1,It got boring,"I didn't enjoy it yes it was well made but it is very overhyped and isn't anything to rave about , Not really worth your time unless you love long dull films."
1,Read This,"This movie is about A jew that survives the whole bloody war. In the end some German finds him , feels sorry for him and lets him live. He also goes on on play the Piano after all the $hit he has been through. Sorry if I messed up the ending but what can I say......."
5,Keep History alive.,In a day and time when so many are saying the Holicost never happened it's important to remind us that this really happened.
4,Face Frame Clamps,"Clamps like these make assembling face frames, especially larege ones a snap. Rather that needing a pipe clamp the whole width of the frame, these just clamp on the rails and let you clamp down on it. Be a little careful with soft woods or they may get marred by the clamp though."
3,Not his best,"An easy read, but certainly not the best Trollope wrote. The characters don't come to live, and the part about the elections, which quite often Trollope describes well, falls flat. The other Trollope speciality, a hunt, is missing. All in all, the book is rather bland."
1,Not same as pictured,The product i received was not the same product that was shown in the picture and i would like to see if i could exchange it.
5,Three for a low price!,"After several weeks of searching on line, I finally found this bargain! All the other sites had only the washing wand for $25, but this site had all three for $25 and because it was $25...I got free shipping too! Once you use this washing method for your cars or boats...you will NEVER settle for anything else! It makes washing your cars, etc., fun, easy and they come out cleaner than a car wash too!"
2,Wasn't what I needed,"The description of this autowash with brush attachment and one of the pictures with it led me to believe that it could be attached to a regular garden hose. If that is what you are looking for, don't order it. I had to send it back."
2,Not great,I returned this. The water drained out so fast it made it difficult to wash my car and boat. Sorry
2,Only the brush attachment is worth while,"The ""synthetic attachment"" misses a lot of spots around trims, the handle is too short for me.I ended up using the brush only, which I could have just picked up at a hardware store for cheaper."
3,Too soft!,"My husband is the one who uses these brushes to wash the cars, but he says the main brush is too soft to get the grime off the hood of the car. To be fair, the car was rather dirty at that point. The soap tube also collapses when you try and clean the top of the car, but I believe it is designed to do so. Perhaps I didn't understand the initial description. Overall it is a good product for the price. It gets the job done and if you're not picky, would be just fine."
3,The books are good but don't take the classes now offered,"The books are good not doubt about it, they highlight the info in a very easy way. However, they do not elaborate on subjects that are problematic for typical students like acid/base chemistry and fluid motion and magnetism. I think they rely way to heavily on diagrams rather than actually discussing topics. Buy the books if you want the basics but realize that this cannot be your only tool - there is really not a lot of practice in them and you will still have to review major concepts on your own. Its a good start though.Stay away from the classes though! They pretty much hire anyone, do not have their own training protocal and charge you an arm and a leg!"
2,Waste of money....,I bought this book because of all the raves on this site and overall I wasn't impressed. This book is very vague and outlines the concepts covered in the MCAT very briefly. In addition to this set I always felt I needed to look in my college texts for supplementary information. When I actually went to write the MCAT last year I found many of the questions were not even mentioned in the Examkrackers. I might as well have read my textbooks instead of waste 88$.
3,Save your time and money,"Unorganized, hard to follow, some good questions but not very good explanations. Stick to Kaplan Books and the visualaid dvds."
3,Not useful if you have not taken the courses before,"I have never taken the Biology and Organic Chemistry classes and found these books more confusing than the Kaplan's books. Particularly the Organic Chemistry book, the materials were only briefly mentioned and insufficient to prepare for MCAT. It wasn't helpful to me at all. I have taken Physics and Chemistry before and still felt the Kaplan's books were better (however, I am not suggesting the Kaplan's books are worth the money either). I wouldn't recommend this book to others!"
5,Examkrackers is the BEST MCAT study guide,"I researched MCAT study guides extensively, and I don't regret getting the Examkrackers books. I believe their advice is superb, as well as the content. My recomendation is getting the complete study package (but not the audio CD's unless you have $$ to burn). The books are great. I've only had 1, ten week biology course, but after studying examkrackers bio hard core for 1 week, I was scoring 10's in the AAMC practice tests 4R and 5R for biology. Good luck on the MCATs!"
3,Background is definately necessary with this package,"I found these books to be valuable for my studying because I am already a science student. Not only that, I was already in my third year when I took the test so I think that that also helped, I can't imagine having taken the MCAT without having taken my physiology class. The biology section is definately worthwhile. I dont recommend the orgo or physics books to people without a firm grasp of the topics already. The Chemistry is decent, but not amazing either, but it's worth the money. In short, if you have a background, this book is relatively worth it, if not-you'll need something more in-depth."
5,The best in MCAT Prep,"I studied independently using only these materials and scored a 34 on the MCAT. The only other book you may need is ""16 Mini MCATs,"" also by Exam Krackers."
4,Must Have,I awarded this book a 4 since nothing I believe can be perfect and this book comes quite close to that distinction. It's well organized and I never felt my study plans confused while going through this book. Secondly it cuts the stuff and extra details the MCAT would never test. This is the major point where all other prep company's falter. Just remember to keep steady over your study schedule and over all the info presented in the book. Everything is presented in an easily comprehensible manner and can be grasped with comfort.Good Luck.

5,Great product,This is a good product for a younger rock star wanta be. Priced reasonably & the size is just right for about age 10 & under.
3,Get what you pay for.,"Not great, not bad. The amp is fairly pathetic but I expected that. The guitar is hard to tune: direct result of that wonderful chinese craftmanship. The amp has a ""drive"" button that does nothing, guess I was under the assumption it would have some kind of distortion effect. Silly me. I just hooked one of my old pedals up to it-problem solved. Bottom line my 6 yr. old has fun with it. The best thing a parent can do is put an instrument or book in the hands of your child and get them interested in something besides video games and TV. This accomplishes that for a low price."
2,updated review.,I first reviewed this product and gave it an excellent rating. The product itself seems to be doing well but two days after my cousin received this in the mail my sister calls to tell me that The zipper broke on his case the very first day! Otherwise it is in great condition. I just really wish I still had a case for him and it was not broken!!
1,Not So Good,"First the Zipper on the Bag Fall apart instantly, The Guitar itself is alright build quality strings on the guitar loose as can be almost falling off. cord to plug into amp split at both ends after 2nd use. all in all get a better one."
3,Won't stayed tuned.,"The Guitar is the perfect size, and color for my little boy. However, My husband has tuned the guitar several times and before my son playes it it is out of tune. He has only played this guitar with his dad, never without an adult."
2,"Tinny, won't stay tuned, bad connections, Def not pink","I would not recommend this guitar. The concept is good because the little amp is fun, but the connections to the guitar is bad, so it fades in and out and you're always having to play with the cord. The sound is very tinny and no matter how many times I tune it, it's back out of tune WITHIN MINUTES. The look and feel of the guitar is really good however. IT IS DEFINITELY NOT PINK. IT'S RED. So if your little girl desires pink, this is NOT the guitar you should order. It says metallic pink on the box, but it is not in any way pink. Santa brought my 4 year old this guitar, and she doesn't like or enjoy it. She still likes the old acoustic pink guitar much better. It was enticing because the package is complete and the price is good, but I wouldn't recommend this purchase. Sorry Barcelona!"
1,Guitar was defective.,Guitar was unevenly cut and defective on the amp (the amp gave a constant feedback which got worst with time.)
5,Buick book A Complete History,My husband loves Buicks. I drive a 2011 Lacrosse and he has two antique Buicks. I got this book for him as a Christmas gift and he absolutely loves it. I would highly recommend this book for any Buick lover.
4,heads above the rest,"The best hammer i have found, for the price ,it is comperableto the stilleto hammer.thought it is about half the price ,it is twice the hammer,I use my Blue max for every thing Idrive nails,pull nails,chip concreat, break banding straps,pry bar. I have only lost the head once,but one new weadg fixed it .love the hammer!"
5,Fantastic Balance,"I've been through a lot of framing hammers over the past 20 years, and this is my all time favorite. Shark Corp. always makes great nail pullers and great Japanese hand saws, so I was willing to give this a try, even though it looks weird. The balance is incredible, perfect for driving 16 penny nails, the milled face is very precise and really grips so it doesn't slide once you've made contact. My favorite all around hammer to keep in my tool belt."
2,"Eh,",Wierd to say the least. The claws are only good for pulling nails. You beter be accurate with your strikes. If an when you do hit the nail it does it's job quickly. Definitely not a framing hammer replacement.
3,Just too weird!,"I'm biased in the first place because I swear by titanium hammers. Maybe I didn't give it a chance, but it felt like swinging a 3lb drilling hammer. I just couldn't develop any accuracy with it. I'd love to hear from a few folks who use it sucessfully. Good conversation piece. I convinced one guy that the hammer design has been around for 250 years, and that daffy duck was patterned after the hammer rather than the other way around."
1,A pure waste of your money,I expected to get a tool to calibrate my home theater system with - to balance the speaker levels and such. All i got was something that even the simple noise that my reciever can produce out performes. All that and for a very expensive price.In short - don't buy.
3,Not compatible with windows 7,"This may or may not be a good network card, I don't know. I purchased it assuming it was compatible, which was a huge mistake. The drivers it comes with are for windows 95, 98, and 2000. If you spend 20 minutes navigating Proxim's website you can find drivers for windows XP, but it is NOT compatible with windows 7.The tech support told me ""we should work on that to keep up with the market, but I don't know when"" so if you are reading this review in 2020, it may work by then (this timeline is based on not even having windows XP drivers on the install CD, which is close to a 10 year old OS).On the bright side, [...] had great customer service and a good return policy."
1,look elsewhere,"Yet another book that trys to teach you things you didnt actually buy the book for.Like how to come up with a story and character and how you should develop the character and basic drawing tips.Come on,this is supposed to be about Maya.Also I like the chapter thats starts out""What is modeling?""Hmmmm...lets see...I paid a couple of grand for this software...I guess I should learn what exactly modeling is shouldnt I? hmmmmm...what IS modeling?We know what modeling is already...sheeesh.This book is also very vague at times.Why cant anyone write a tutorial book thats any good? I know they are out there.I'll keep searching and so should you."
2,DO NOT BUY,These cost as much as the collections do but for half the number of episodes.Quality of episodes are the same but these are a rip off!
4,The weakest of the New Jersey trilogy is still a great read,"Many of Kevin Smith's fans were dissapointed in his second film, Mallrats, and it certainly id not on the same level as Clerks or the more recent Chasing Amy. However, I feel the weakness of the film is largely due to some weaknesses in the casting, a theory which is supported by this screenplay, which is far far better read than when mouthed by the film's cast."
4,good but not great,"'rats has it moments without a doubt. i think it would have been a better flick if they left the whole governers ball opening in there. im glad it showed up on the dvd....alot of the individual scenes were great, but the movie as a whole was lacking. possibly just due to the fact you cant review it without taking the rest of the trilogy, dogma and the comic's into concideration. and tons of charachters from clerks were brought up in 'rats....willam is in it, just played by eathan instead of moiser. not to mention the julie dwyer connection, and there was a quick stop reference in one of the cut scenes...its still a good movie. just not as good a clerks, or amy..."
4,An Excellent Addition to the Horror Film Fans Library.,"A Taste of Blood belongs in the true horror fan's library sandwiched between David Friedman's A Youth in Babylon and The Amazing World of H.G. Lewis. Taste offers capsulated reviews of all of Mr. Lewis's films as well as interesting interviews with key players. This book is definetly a work written ""by a fan, for the fans"" and lacks the objective insights to make it a five star work. It is ,however, a compasionate and long overdue tribute to one facet of a multitalented gentleman who deserves the title ""Wizard of Gore""."
2,"Well researched, poorly written","I purchased this book because I like and am interested in HG Lewis and his films. There's a very small amount of published information available and this seemed like a decent compendium of Lewis' canon. While that turned out to be true, it's well researched and seems very complete, the actual writing is atrocious. The author, a fan, admits from the start that he's not actually a writer. While I appreciate his candor, and respect the effort that clearly went into this project, it didn't make reading it any easier."
3,Contractor,"I bought this nailer next to the other three nailer I already have, all the information about this nailer telling you that this nailer is one of the best, in fact I,m not lucky or this nailer is no better than any of average nailer on the market, in the first 100 nail been set the nailer jambed also miss fire after one houre, I know it need to clean the gate for not to miss fire but it keep do it very ofen that is not bad the bad news is I could not open the gate after the driver jamed for about 1 hour only the gate open with a screw driver to insert between the gate and the body which is not a simple thing to do this nailer keep jambing for about 7 time for a 600 sf of hard wood floor I do flooring every day and been working with nailer for about seven years this nailer is not a super one like they talke about"
2,no booklit with dvd.,this is the 2nd time I have ordered this dvd and it is the 2nd time I have received it without the music booklet. the dvd itself is good but it does say on the back of the disk package that there is a 44 page tab music booklit included. there was no booklit with either package.
2,Errr...this is not the same stuff I wore around 1980,"Yikes! I was thrilled to find this product still available, but it is NOT the same nostalgic scent I was longing for. You never forget your first scent. I doused myself in it and it smells like bug spray! My husband thought I had applied sunscreen on, not knowing what it was. Not for me."
5,Delicious Floral Scent,"This is a heavy floral scent that I happen to love. It smells like bergamot, with a little rose scent. Very European, classy, and fine."
1,Completely unshippable! Do not order this online!,"While the saw may be good (we dont know), only the craziest of gamblers will order this online after hearing our experiences:o ordered this sawo 2wks later, get the saw. It arrives cracked.o call toolcrib, ask for replacemento 1 wk later, UPS picks it up. Toolcrib gets it a week later.o another 2 wks and the replacement arrives. Its cracked too.o call toolcrib, tell them to cancel everything and refund uso a week later UPS takes away the box from our porch.o 2-4 wks later toolcrib will refund our credit card :(Lesson: go to the hardward store to buy it, unless this 9-week hassle is something you think you'd like.p.s. the same piece was cracked in half on both saws. the piece that moves the blade up and down. It cannot be replaced seperately."
3,Stand is extra $$,"Good price if you are not interested in a stand. If you need a folding stand look at the DeWalt or Bosch, they come with a stand. If you buy this PC and pay extra for the stand you spend almost as much. The DeWalt and Bosch are better saws anyway."
3,"Good saw, horrible customer support!","I just got this saw, and shipped it back in two hours.I just bought this saw after a few months of searching for a replacement for my 16 year old radial arm saw in my garage workshop. I've had great experiences with my Porter-Cable routers and sanders, so I thought I'd give this one a shot.Right out of the box I could tell this was well built, and everything was accurately aligned at the factory. It had plenty of power for ripping birch plywood I use for cabinets.The slight problem was that the rip fence extension would not lock in the extended position....so I called Porter-Cable's 800 number......It was pretty obvious that Porter-Cable didn't want my business, so I packed the saw up and shipped it back. Too bad, now I have to spend ... more for the Bosch, but maybe they will care that their products work."
5,"Inspiring, captivating...this book doesn't last long","I have read all of Mark's books and this is my favourite. Full of humour, you can't help but fall in love with Tara and the magic of India. The sequel Queen Of The Elephants is also worth reading; this film of QotE is shown regulary on Discovery/Animal Planet."
1,Harmageddon is the Worst Anime Available in the U.S.,"I would like to say that I am a fan of subtitled over dubbed. Even so, this is far worse in the original Japanese than even the worst dub. The characters are one-dimensional and caricatures of real people. The movie spends so much time building up the first 3 characters that you would expect to feel something for them; you don't. The remaining cast is not developed. You're torn between hoping that they'll die or the movie will just end now. It never seems to. If only good anime was released with this many minutes of viewing! The ""evil"" character has no motivation beyond wanting to destroy the universe. If you are new to anime, trust me, this will drive you away from it forever. If you're experienced, you know this is everything that you never liked."
3,"Harmagedon, Feels Good","While the animation is somewhat dated, it is a very long and engaging story. Not the best, but very good."
5,An excellent performance from singer and orchestra,"Having recently acquired this recording which is virtually unavailable outside Korea, I can say that I very much enjoyed all the tracks. Sumi Jo's singing is exquisite here as always and in this case she is ably and sensitively supported by the orchestra under the leadership of Stefan von Cron. Highly recommended!"
2,Lack-luster,"Frankly I was not impressed by this recording. The best track on the whole album is ""Summertime"". If you want Sumi Jo at her best try a different CD."
4,Younger readers like this book too!,"Many have said you need to be older (at least 40) to appreciate this book, but I loved it and I'm only 26. Jewett made me feel like I was really there in Dunnet Landing, and since the narrator is never named, I felt like I was the narrator, living her experiences (it helps that the narrator in this story is a writer and so am I). I loved Jewett's descriptive language and rich characterization. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates beautiful imagery and unforgettable characters. My favorite character in the novel is Mrs. Todd's mother, Mrs. Blackett -- I wish I was as loving and giving and self-forgetful as she is! My husband and I are planning a trip to coastal Maine this summer, and I will be thinking about this novel while I'm there."
5,Graveyard literature,"I've read many wonderful novels but I could count on the fingers of one hand those that seemed to transcend literature and, in Kenneth Rexroth's phrase, bring me face-to-face with the meaning of existence. Of that glorious few, ""The Country of the Pointed Firs"" is by far the shortest and yet, mysteriously and inexplicably, the deepest. It's a still and quiet book; it will not show its face it to you if you read it while riding the subway to work. It's the sort of book to read on sitting alone in a graveyard while a cool breeze blows the last autumn leaves from the branches. That's the best description I can give you; it's too subtle and beautiful for summaries. Just read it, please."
3,excellent but dated,"Marcia Yudkin has a great style and many useful hints, but much has changed in the few years since this book came out. I hope she will put out a new edition that takes into account the internet's effect on the way people do research."
3,"Love this author, but not this book.","I too got tangled up in the personal stories and anecdotes while reading. Was looking for practical useful information, and had to wade through to find it. There IS useful information, you just have to read to find what you are looking for.I did however find the information on copywriting and taxes very useful, and marked those pages for to more easily locate the information later, when I need it."
3,Not that good.,"The writer gave valuable information, but it got sidetracked and tainted by her personal stories. I am more interested in facts, not entertainment. In a stack of other books, it was just lost."
2,It Ain't as Easy as She Makes it Look,"This is a good effort. Unfortunately I find this book to be a bit outside the experience of most serious freelancers. Which is to say, the author is living a life to which many may aspire, but in which few find themselves. Also, that the author presents much of what she covers as easier to achieve than it really is.This is not to say that the book is all bad. Ms. Yudkin is an accomplished writer, and she provides quite a bit of useful information. But she really ought to have provided more hands-on, or how-you-can-do-it info. Finally, she might have used a voice that would speak to a wider audience than people like herself."
1,No one takes this book seriously,"This book exhibits deep flaws and methodological failings. The author advances his argument--that Mormonism is some sort of Christian/Masonic populist movement--through speculation, a dubious and selective reading of historical sources, and ""cherry-picked"" parallels. I have no idea how this work made it through the peer review process at Columbia University press, although Forsberg mentions that one of the reviewers was John Brooke, whose own speculative work on Mormon origins has come under fire. Still, at least Brooke's speculations were interesting and consistent with existing literature. By contast, Forsberg's ""examples as evidence"" approach will convince no one (LDS or otherwise) who knows Mormon history. This book should not have been published, least of all by a press like Columbia."
5,Power pilates,The history and success of pilates from Joseph Pilates to our days. The book covers the different styles of pilates. Love it!
4,Wonderful time saver for large projects,"I primed and painted four new rooms and trim using flat acrylic paint. The 1st setup and clean up each took about 30 minutes but subsequent setups and cleanups took 10 minutes. The consistency is wonderful but a quick light pass with a roller is recommend to even out the paint dispersement and user error. It took me a hour to prime four rooms and two hours to paint two coats of flat paint. Overall, I estimated a 75% time savings. Highly recommended. An earlier reviewer had mentioned a broken tip, this package comes with an extra tip and is easy to replace (1 minute)"
4,Pump Up The Volume,"Bill Laswell leads a clubland romp in drum-n-bass which sets an incredible pace that does not abate.What is a Laswell-Submerged project, the latter delivers the hot beats, as guest drummer Guy Licata and trumpeter Toshinori Kondo deliver their takes in the mix. The sounds are provided by Laswell, Submerged and Enduser.There is an artistry in pumping up the volume and Laswell powers that point home."
5,shooting shades,"the smoke colored lenses are just dark enough to cut glare but see the target clearly in the day. I use them over my prescription glasses with no problem. The ear pieces are adjustable, a nice feature. The wraparound sides cut out side glare nicely also."
2,Lots of Emotion over Not Very Much...,"Good actors in a bad movie. Nolte and Bridges play childhood buddies with a dark (dark-ish, by Hollywood standards) secret, which comes back to haunt them. Why now, after so many years, do things come to a head? We don't really know. Characters (like Catherine Keener's) float around with no apparent purpose. Bridges and Stone experience emotional meltdowns rather too suddenly to be believable. The hysteria just isn't warranted, given the crime, and the time that has passed.Even Albert Finney--a great actor by any standard--seems to be wondering what's going on. As always, though, he's a pleasure to watch, and his character possesses a bearing and dignity that the others could stand to learn from.Expect one thing from this movie: a keen sense of disappointment."
4,"Nolte, Bridges, and Stone working together","""Simpatico"" PLOT: The lives of a rich horse-breeder and his wife are turned upside-down when an old friend returns with some incriminating evidence to link them to a blackmailing scheme which occurred about 20 years earlier Directed by Matthew Warchus ("
1,Sharon Stone Fans it is not.,"I had to buy these movie, because I am a Sharon Stone fan. I was so disappointed. In the whole movie you get to see her in about 5 short times, which where the 5 best in the whole movie. The rest of movie was boring. I love Sharon Stone Movies and have them all. Hope to see her in somthing better soon."
1,good actors bad movie,"The main problem here seems to be that the central event in the story, the scam , just isnt interesting, its certainly hard to beleive in the characters and their interrelationship based on this event, from there it just falls apart.Basically boring and very missable."
1,DUDSVILLE!,"Terrible, awful, disgusting. Why Nick Nolte, Jeff Bridges, and especially Albert Finney would lend their name to this garbage should be the subject of a book. I can see Sharon Stone here but not the others. You've been warned. I'd be ashamed to even try and sell it."
2,HORSIN AROUND,"You would think with such a pedigree of talent (four Oscar nominees), SIMPATICO would come charing out of the gates and knock you over! Beautifully filmed in Kentucky and California, the movie however is merely a cinematic version of one of playwright Sam Shepard's character studies. It's plot is so convoluted and erratic, it's hard to keep up with. And the twists the movie takes, most notably the seeming reversal of the two male characters, it becomes annoying in its duplicity. Credit goes to Albert Finney and Catherine Keener particularly for at least trying to flesh out otherwise cardboard characters. Sharon Stone doesn't show up until the movie's almost over, and we get to see her do her sleazy alcoholic hasbeen role once again. Ditto to Nick Nolte, who seems to have made a career playing scruffy looking nobodies. Even the usually reliable Jeff Bridges gets lost in the muddled film. I don't know what I was expecting, but SIMPATICO doesn't win, place or even show for me."
2,"Interesting Enough to Watch, But...","The plot and the characters become incomprehensible about midway through the film. About three quarters of the way through, I was thinking, ""What is the point of this movie?"" Then, for no particular reason, Sharon Stone shoots a horse (a big ""what the...?"" moment). Finally, the ending left me with an ""I don't get it"" feeling.Nolte and Bridges made the film watchable and interesting for a while. But when Bridges' character suddenly changes his personality and starts acting just like Nolte's character for no good reason (I guess it was supposed to have some deep symbolic meaning, but it means nothing when it's totally arbitrary and illogical and unbelievable given the premises of the story), I thought it might be time to give up on Simpatico and try another DVD. I should have."
5,You can't go wrong.,"What a wonderful collection of inspiring pieces from a broad section of the recovering community. Each story offers a glimpse at the challenges faced and how individuals reclaimed what was rightfully theirs - health, happiness and hope. I'd recommend it for anyone entering recovery as well as those who are already living a recovering lifestyle."
3,The Little Heroes.,"I watched this movie when I was little and loved it and then when I was older I watched it again.The plot and the overall movie was good,but it didn't make much sense how at the first Charley Wilson said that her mom always told her it didn't matter what you had it mattered what you are on the inside.Thats great,but through the rest of the movie she was absorbed in Charlie having all the right clothes.She seemed to contradict herself.Like when Alonzo(the local farmer)brought Charley back from her first time at Church,Rachel,Charlie's mother said ""You went in those clothes!""By the way,Charlie had never been to church because her parents were ashamed that they were so poor!It is a good movie still though."
2,THIS IS NOT A ZWILLING SET - THESE ARE MADE IN VIETNAM,"for $2 less, you can get the GOOD German Zwillings. They do not come with a block, but there is a tremendous difference between the 2. I accidentally ordered this, and soon as I opened the package and handled the knives - even before I saw they were Vietnamese, I was not impressed. They handle nicely, but do yourself a favor and when looking for ANYTHING Henckel, look for the ZWILLINGS with the twins stamped into the blade, handle - whatever."
5,best knives for the price,"These knives are the best I've ever bought, they are color coded, each with a different knife, a great little block for them, and boy are they sharp, and they stay that way"
4,Good knives,"I find myself using these more than I thought. As one reviewer said, the color coding is nice when you want to grab a knife quickly. They are quite sharp too. No complaints about this set, and for the price I paid (during the Friday sale), it was a good investment."
4,Cutting edge,"These knives are small and easy to use. Plus, they are sharp no smashed tomatoes!!!! The handy holder keeps them close at hand and not loose in the drawer to cut your fingers when you are rummaging for ""whatever""."
5,Love them.,"I bought these after exhaustive research on knives and wanting a good set. I even bought a $300 complete set from costco which I later returned due to poor quality. I actually wanted an entire set to replace my old crap knives but settled on an inexpensive set which included the Sanduko knife and steak knives and this set (which I use more than anything else). Having kids really deterred my decision for very sharp or high quality knives with the exception of these (which I believe are both high quality and sharp). These knives are small enough to handle without cutting yourself but sharp enough to handle most home kitchen small jobs (which at my house seem to be the majority of them). I could only be happier if there was one good say 6"" Knife then they would be all I use. Color coding is nice because you are always sure of which knife you are reaching for. This is a nice small set for the counter and daily use."
2,knives,"I purchased this item because of the reviews. I should have returned it, but loved the wooden holder and put my own knives in it. The knives are dangerous... thin, bend, extremely sharp. I wish the knives where safe since the color coding was a great advantage."
2,Flawed Sound Murders Carmen,"Whatever merit this performance of Carmen may have, the sound quality rendered it, for me, totally unlistenable. My only hope is that Opera d'Oro does not publish technically questionable recordings like this in most cases (i've debated buying other titles in their catalog but have not yet gathered the nerve). I notice the Opera d'Oro label has another Carmen offered in its catalog - Alberto Erede conducting - and hopefully it is appreciably better in sound (although it is also live) - it would almost have to be better. If not, shame on them."
3,Karajan conducts who?,"The inferior sound is not the only reason to reject this recording. The studio recording with de Burgos (and much the same cast as here) may be slightly less ""exciting,"" but it's a lot closer to what Bizet wrote than this weird-as-usual effort by Karajan, who never met a composer he didn't think could be improved upon by adjusting tempi, dynamics, etc. I'll take Bizet over Karajan any day."
3,Solo work free for all,"A modern intrpetation. Its a free for all with lots of creative solo innovation. Very brassy trumpet solos and with a little too much of the the muted ""wa wa"" gymnastics for me. Violin solos are innovative."
3,Fairbanks' Last Hurrah,"Most of Douglas Fairbanks' sound films were rather dismal affairs - indicating his lack of talkie enthusiasm. However, ""Mr. Robinson Crusoe"" (1932) occasionally recaptures the old spirit. In this lighthearted romp, Doug bets that he can survive on a deserted South Seas island for an entire year. Displaying remarkable ingenuity, he creates a tropical Park Avenue. For his penultimate film, Fairbanks performs a few memorable stunts amid the breathtaking Tahitian locales. ""Mr. Robinson Crusoe"" also benefits from A. Edward Sutherland's breezy direction and Alfred Newman's evocative score. No match for Doug's silent classics, but pleasurable escapism."
1,terrible quality,"This film is unique and deserves the best treatment possible. The treatment here is surely not it. I have a Laserdisc that is considerable better as well as an old (abridged) Super 8, showing that there are far better copies out there.This is a ripp-off. The DVD is not worth one dollar. Could anyone tell me if there is a decent copy out there somewhere?"
4,Enjoy this old Heinlein classic,"A fine old SF yarn, laced with intelligence, about a young farmboy trying to realize his dream of venturing into space as a trained ""astrogator"", a kind of space navigator. I liked the way the book shows young Max Jones making some bad decisions and mistakes in judgement early on, but thanks to good advice and honest self-examination, recovers from those mishaps and gets back on the right path. The result is a story that sends a nice message to its intended audience of young people that nobody's perfect and one can not only recover from mistakes but become a stronger person because of them.Nicely juxtaposing elements such as high adventure and romance with tough decisions and the realities of life, this is a great little book, and I can see why it's still in print 50-plus years after its original publication. And I didn't even talk about the scene-stealing alien pet, the ""spider-puppy"" known as Mr. Chips! Wait'll you get a load of that little bugger."
1,huh?,"this is pointless cuz phones these days have data, when this first hit it was cool but hard to use!"
4,Brilliant!,Absolutely awesome...I use this book like a reference for my challenges in life! Thank YOU!
4,many years of great prints,"I too experienced the paper feeding problems that others have reported but I was able to work out a solution. The LaserJet 6L can feed paper back into an upright bin after printing, or out a slot in the front. A small lever on the front left side of the printer selects where the paper will be directed. After a few years, I experienced jams when the switch was in the upright position to feed the paper back up into the bin. When I put the switch down, to have the paper come out the front of the unit, the problem went away. Print quality is excellent and the cost per print is a small fraction of what ink jet copies cost. Before the 6L, I owned a LaserJet 2 for nearly 15 years. I think that the 6L might equal that record."
3,"Better than its predecessor, still not great","The HP Laserjet 5L jammed constantly; I owned two and both were destroyed by my repeated efforts to clear jams that routinely occurred in an inaccessible area under the fuser. My 6L didn't jam until I'd owned it for a few months, but eventually the same thing happened and I had to invest in about $80 of repairs.Considering that these older printers will inevitably be bought used and cheap, though, one probably has to accept that they won't be perfect."
1,HP Laserjet 6L,"My refurbished printer did not work when it came out of the shipping package. The error light stayed on and I could not get the printer to recognize that paper was in the bin and ready to go. The seller was nice enough to troubleshoot the problem with me, but I had to ship it back. Hopefully I will get a refund because I don't think the printer can be fixed. In addition, when I looked on line regarding this printer, I found another major problem--the printer tends to pull several sheets of paper at a time from the paper bin which has been a major complaint from other customers on various websites."
3,A good low cost laser printer but it jams a lot,"This prints fast and produces adequate low cost laser copies. Also the printer cartridges last a long time, nearly 4,000 pages. The downside of this printer is that it only feeds properly with an absolutely full even stack of paper. Once it gets about 1/3 the way down, be prepared for it to start feeding multiple pages through. Once it gets about 1/2 way down, then it really starts to jam up as it often feeds the rest of the stack through.It doesn't take all that long to unjam it, but it is irritating when you have large print jobs to do.Only buy one of these if you can find a very good price on it and need a low cost laser printer."
4,A touching story of an evolving relationship.,"This is the 1st novel I've read of Grimsley's, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. His use of time and rendering of human emotion and feeling greatly outweigh the tendency for repetition in descriptions of emotions and actions. I did appreciate his descriptions of places and events, like the harrowing medical procedures that Dan has to endure and Ford administers. Ford and Dan's relationship is an unlikely one, but that made it all the more lovely to envision. I really fell in love with both characters, found myself wanting to know more of them and felt sad to see them go at the end, which is my surest sign that I loved the novel."
1,Pass this one buy--read Dream Boy,"Simple and poor attempt at a novel. That is all I have to say. If you want to read a very well written gay novel, read Edmund White. If you are, more spacifically, looking for a gay love novel, there are many far better choices (might I recommend Boy Culture by Matthew Rettenmund.) If you would like to give Grimsley another chance, though, read Dream Boy. While dream boy is anything BUT a well written literary gem, I cherish it all the same for it's heart, sentiment, and pure nostalgia of those adolecent emotions that are never to be relived unless through a book.Though also be warned that the author has a huge ego and responds bitterly to any criticism in reviews. If you loathe something of his you read, either don't your email adress, don't review it at all, or be prepared."
2,Cliche and Juvenile,"Comfort and Joy reminded me of the books that I had read as a teenager. The conflicts seemed artificially black and white. The dialogue felt forced and overused. The story lacked signficant creativity. The characters felt like unreal archtypes. As a younger and inexperienced adolescent, I might have enjoyed this book more, since it gives a glimpse--albeit simplistic--of love between two men. I might have even found the conflicts of the main characters intriguing. As an adult with more exposure to life's complexity, I instead found the work lacking depth--lacking a pulse for how people really interact or for the subtlety and irony of existence--compared with the standard I've come to expect from comtemporary works--gay-themed or not."
1,Poorly written and predictable,"Grimsley's talent isn't on display on this boring ""gay novel"" about a guy and his boyfriend and family. I didn't find anything believable in this book, and the writing was sub-par. Try Dorothy Allison's work instead."
1,Gay melodrama is tiresome,"If you want to read a book by this author, read ""Winter Birds"" and not this far-fetched gay melodrama. Some of the dialogue is laughable. I feel like the publisher has scraped the bottom of the Grimsley barrel and ought to wait for him to write a fine book and then publish that."
1,No Joy Here,"""Comfort and Joy"" is a whisper-thin novel that can be consumed in less than two hours....two UNSATISFACTORY hours. It seems that the usually brilliant Mr. Grimsley wrote this story while he was half asleep. The characters are so slight and underdeveloped, you'd never guess they were created by the author of ""Winter Birds"" and ""My Drowning"".The story revolves around the unlikely pairing of Dan Crell and Ford McKinney. Let's be honest - there is no way we can believe that a relationship could form between a Captain Marvel-Ken Doll- Doctor with tons of cash and an emotionally-stunted, homely, poor, HIV patient. Maybe it's Jim Grimsley's feverish fantasy to land such a prize lover, but it doesn't work for the reader.People who remember ""Winter Birds"" with the same fondness that I do will hate the fact that Ellen Crell, Allen and especially Amy Kay have grown into people with no dimension."
1,"A predictable and ""calculated"" novel","This implausible tale of a gay relationship between a handsome doctor and a homely guy with not much going for him seems ""calculated"" by the author as a romance to appeal to gay men. Unfortunately, when writers try to write deliberately for a certain market (instead of just writing a good book), the results are usually wooden and predictable, as is the case here. I would definitely pass on this one."
1,How disappointing!,"I can hardly believe that the talented Jim Grimsley of Winter Birds is the same author of Comfort & Joy (and of Dream Boy for that matter). Mr Grimsley here delivers a story and characters he himself is not convinced about. Without mentioning his seedy, amateurish style, all his characters are lame and stereotyped. Take Ford's mother for example. Take her phone conversation with him before Christmas. She clearly comes down as an idiotic upper class woman. Only not a believable idiot, but a cliché one, straight from a soap. I can understand a brilliant young writer being pressured from agents and publishers, but why accepting to tarnish one's career so indelibly?"
5,A beauty,"Glad that I managed to purchase this out-of-print book through Amazon market sellers. I read Winter Birds some time back and was discomforted somewhat by its tragic bleakness. I am very pleased that Grimsley has continued with Danny's life in Comfort and Joy. This is a beautiful book about two men's love for one another, their bond ultimately strong enough to achieve what they really wanted despite all the odds against them. I am just glad that Grimsley gave a happy ending to Danny's painful life. Grimsley writes from his heart, his words soulful and heartfelt. His characters shine, each one with a purpose in this beautiful story. Yes the story was a comfort and a joy to read."
3,Underwhelming,"Clear and fluid prose, excellent imagery, under-whelming story. Grimsley's ability to paint beautiful scenery with words is nearly negated by his inability to write a gripping story. I finished this book wanting more. I didn't feel particularly enriched by this novel although it was a quick and easy read. Based on the other reviews of this author I'll try another novel by him but probably not anytime soon."
4,Finally a gay novel with substance,"Comfort & Joy is a flawless novel, as well-crafted as the author's previous books, but with a more fully-realized story. Place is an important element in this novel,as with Grimsley's previous books. The physical locations are nearly palpable. The gay themes are realistic: sustaining a relationship, health, acceptance from family, sex. Yet the novel is larger than even those themes. It is about humanity and Comfort & Joy is a beautiful book for any thoughtful reader."
5,A Joy To Read - Hard to put down,"This is the first novel I have read by this author but it won't be the last. I found much of this novel to be so true to life that it was at times startling. The emotional issues the two main characters experience (families, moving in together, financial differences and the whole coming out process) are issues that any gay man in a relationship is likely to encounter. I read this book in less than 24 hours. I hope one day there is a sequel."
5,I related on so many levels with this book,"I have to read Mr. Grimsley's other books now. I read ""Comfort and Joy"" in 2 evenings. I usually am reading 3 to 4 books at a time, but this one caught and kept my attention, mainly because of the gorgeous prose and the similarities to my own life. Everything in this book rang true for me. Coming home for the holidays, coming out to your family and co-workers, the bittersweet, often fragile family relationships, the fear of coming to terms with your own gayness, from the first feelings of desire all the way through moving in together, the parents who will not accept you or your partner, the class differences between your partner's family and your own...all are explored in this poignant, deeply felt novel. This is one of my all time faves now."
4,A New Hoilday Tradition,"I just finsihed this novel for a local book club and was pleased with story, characters and quality of writing. Although the book ""jumps"" around (I got confused) a little it is still a superb work. Mr. Grimsley had effortlessly caught the emotion that many gay men feel when they go home to their parent(s) for the hoildays. (with partners of not) The barrier of differnce still exists. I like the many opposites this book had, the richness of Ford's family compared to poor, humble family of Dan. (Is it any wonder that Dan's family is more accepting?) The family scenes fly by and I would really like to see a movie made out of this book, I think it would sell! I wish all the new modern Christmas stories were as good as this! Highly recommended!!"
3,"Beautiful, clear, with occasional gusts of schmaltz","Everything I've read by Mr. Grimsley has a haunting, seductive quality. In _Dream Boy_ his prose was RIGHT ON and often wobbled on the line between lush sensuality and histrionics. In _My Drowning_ every phrase and sentence and anaolgy was RIGHT ON. In _Comfort and Joy_ -- I dunno. The novel was laced with schmaltzy moves and over-the-top similes. I still enjoyed it, ultimately, because of that engaging seductiveness, but I was continuously jerked out of my suspended disbelief into a sort of 'disbelief' that really read something as corny as what I just read. I would suggest this book to anybody who had a tolerance of periodic preciousness: with that caveat, though."
4,"Cool shirt, if you're into that sort of thing","My husband's a huge FSU fan AND loves Hawaiian shirts. I bought him this and, while I think it's a bit busy and certainly not in favor of my team, he loved it! Additionally, we ordered through Amazon but the order was placed through Football Fanatics and they were great. When we had to return the shirt for another size (FYI they run large) they couldn't resend the shirt to us as Amazon doesn't transmit our CC info to them. Instead, they refunded our account through Amazon and sent me an email stating that, if I'd like to reorder through their site for another size, they put $10 fan cash in my bank there. We have the shirt my husband wants in the size that he needs and saved a bit in the process!"
3,Picture is deceiving,"The picture is definitely deceiving since it looks much bigger. Because of the dimensions of the box, I thought I would have to do some assembling. Instead, this was very small. My granddaughter is enjoying it, but I was disappointed and will return the second one I bought for another grandchild. Buyer beware!"
4,"Great portable easel, Great price.","I bought this easel for my 3 year old for her birthday to set on top of her art table. It was much less expensive than other table and standing easels and I was impressed by the versatility. My daughter loved the chalk board and the white board and the fact that you could pull the paper up and paint on it. The only things that could make this toy better is a clip at the top to hold the paper in place (we use tape)and a paper holder (dowel) that clips into place as this one just sits there loosely and falls off whenever you move the easel. Removing the wet painting is also a bit awkward but we are adaptable and, all in all, She loves it and will be able to use it for quite a while. Oh! The dry erase markers were almost dead when we received them so a little better quality marker would help but we had some other one as well as washable markers that work too!. Great toy for the price."
2,You get what you pay for!,"This easel was NOT worth even the $10 I paid for it! It is very cheaply made, the paint bottles are VERY small, the chalk was broken, and the roll of paper was NOT 50ft. Very disappointing toy--especially from Fisher Price! Spend more money and get one that will be more worthwhile."
2,"too small, I thought was bigger","this toy suppose to be bigger than really was, I didn't like it, it's too small"
3,What do you expect for the price,A very cheaply made easel. Fisher price usually has quality stuff but not this. Only came with 25 feet of paper not 50 feet like it said. And the paint bottles with it are alot smaller than in the picture. Wouldn't recommend. Spend a little more money for something better. (written for Abby by Mom)
3,Easy & Portable - has some manufacturing defects,"My 3 yr old liked it, good for the price, not upto Fisherprice brand name."
5,Fisher Price Easel,My child enjoyed this toy. It is built very well and has a great value. I recomend this to everyone looking for a great craft toy.Susan Margolis
2,Not as much fun! Not made very well,"I bought this for my 3 year old son. He has fun with it, but it isn't as nice as what I expected. It is very small - even small for my 3 year old. All the chalk was broken, and the markers didn't last long. The paper ran out quickly, and I am not sure there was 50ft on the roll. I was really surprised it was made by Fisher-Price. I really would have expected this quality from the dollar store."
3,Should have read the reviews,The details stated 300 Watts (what I wanted) but the box states only 240 Watts. I could get the 240 Watts cheaper else ware.To late for Christmas now!!.
2,"Great Looks, Poor Build quality","I was originally excited to get the Dulit mixer, however just 3 years on it is broken. The plastic drive gears to the mixer failed prematurely and there is no way to have it repaired. It would be hard to say how many times I used it, but it is fair to say many time less than 100 as we hardly bake anything or need a mixer.I am going to get a different brand this time around."
4,Plastic,"I accidentally broke my mother's solid metal Hamilton Beach mixer. I wanted to buy one like it , but everything is plastic! The Dualit has a good reputation and a chrome color but it still is plastic and doesn't feel as heavy duty."
2,Dualit 88520 Mixer,"This Item was listed at 300 watts. When I received it , on the box, it had a sticker saying it was only 240 watts. I feel that this is a fraud. Jerry"
1,Worst Ever,"This was my most expensive hand mixer and the shortest lived! I have not even had it a couple of months and the motor burned out. I was whipping butter and noticed the smell then little black shavings flew into my bowl then it died! I am SHOCKED, I really had high expectations from this product.Very disappointed."
1,Not Professional,"I waited for a long time after buying this product so that I could test it before writing a review. Every other mixer I purchased burned out after a year or so. I'm not sure how long I have had this one, maybe a year or two. This one also burned out. I was hoping that since it claimed to be ""Professional"" that is would be made with better parts etc. That is not the case. As far as I am concerned, it did no better than than any other mixer on the market. I would not recommend this mixer unless you use it for nothing more than whipping cream."
4,"Great mixer, questionable ergonomics and engineering.","Excellent machine for mixing, whipping, blending. There are a few design issues: 1. It is heavy and bulky. On a standard countertop, I (5ft, 6 in tall) need to hold the hand too high, at an awkward angle, to use the mixer. I suspect it was designed with male users in mind - or for use on lower countertops. My old mixer was much more comfortable. 2. Air intake is in the front of the mixer (a common flaw). The flour (or powdered sugar) will be pulled into the engine, and the mixer will last shorter it would otherwise. You must make sure the flour and sugar are mixed in before you start it. 3. The blending and whipping are performed exceptionally well, but the first speed is too fast."
1,Very disappointed. Couldn't return it fast enough. Chemical smell,"I spent weeks researching hand mixers comparing speed and country of origin. Several reviews I read elsewhere on the web raved that this item was made in Great Britain. WRONG - Made in China!On the first use, the cord would not retract. The chemical smell was overpowering as the mixer ran. So overpowering that I became lightheaded and ill. Yes, I am chemically sensitive but the smell still lingers in the house.The ""chrome finish"" is plastic. It's all plastic except for the beaters.VERY DISAPPOINTED and especially at the price. I expected more, much more for the price than what I got."
1,Didn't Care For It...,"I know there seems to be a lot of fair reviews on this book, but it didn't really seem all that great to me. My biggest complaint overall was the grammatical errors, which is a pet peeve of mine and I kept running into them on just about every page. It made me wonder who exactly did the editing, because they obviously weren't doing their job. The writing just also seemed kind of week, also, although the story was interesting, I feel like the quality of writing brought it down."
5,I Agree with Harriet --Doesn't Get Any Better,"Grave Instinct is a huge roller-coaster ride from start to finish. It begins at lightning speed and just gets faster from there. Those who can't follow Walker's complex sentences need to go back to school. His style is similar to Martin Cruz Smith -- Gorky Park. He's closer to Faulkner than to Hemmingway. So you don't find a lotta easy sentences and you can't go out for a snack until the scene is finished, but the payoff is amazing. My favorite author and I can't wait to jump into his Absolute Instinct and his new series City for Ransom."
1,What Happened???,"I eagerly awaited the release of this in paper back having read all previous Instinct books! The previous books were so well researched, Jessica was smart, savy and knew her proceedure inside out. Nothing slipped past her and she outsmarted everyone!This book she is like a rookie patrolman. It's like someone else wrote this book and just filled it with shock value murder scenes.Oh Mr. Walker, this is such a disappointment!"
4,Good read,Good read. I love books like this..keeps you reading and not wanting to put it down.I would love to read more books by this author.
5,"Gruesome, but Good",I like gruesome stories and this one didn't disappoint. I don't see how can anyone think up these kind of stories.
5,Highly patriotic,"This would be a great CD without Sandi Patty.....but with her, it is outstanding! I also saw her perform her version of the National Anthem at one of the Fourth of July concerts, and while I cringe when someone diverges from the original, when she was done, there wasn't a dry eye or a butt on the ground. When the song stopped, the audience actually erupted. But, back to the CD. Nothing more needs to be said about Kate Smith. Lee Greenwood wrote and performed an excellent song....the Trilogy was great, only thing needed would have been the Jordinaires (sp). Highly entertaining and inspiring, can't go wrong buying this CD."
3,March around the living room,"I was disappointed only because I thought the CD included Ray Charles's America the Beautiful - my mistake. In searching all the patriotic albums, I must have gotten confused. Does anyone know where I can find it? The rest of the CD is a real flag waver."
5,nice quality,"Perfect for every-day use, and come out of the dishwasher with no spots or stains. Nice weight, comfortable handles. Set of 8 is a great value."
2,"Small handles,...flimsy blades...",GERMAN QUALITY NOT! The handle is too small. I am no rocket scientist so they will work. You get what you pay for. These are not a special deal by no means.
1,Not an$80 knife set,These knives don't have an edge. They have serrations. They are more suited to cutting rope than a steak.
3,ok,The knives came very quick and had no problems other than the other half of the order was cancelled and no bothered to tell me.
1,"very lightweight in feel, and flimsy!","I was excited to see this knife set, after we purchased the J.A. Henckels Couteau Series 10-piece Forged Knife Set (from Costco), and there were no steak knives in the set. When they came, I was very disappointed. the knives are flimsy - they don't cut meat, they shred it. The knives themselves are so lightweight, they feel very unsecure when you hold them.It's time to remember, you get what you pay for - don't be fooled into thinking this is a good deal - put out the extra money and get a real set."
1,Don't waste your money,"It may be Henckels, but they are cheap and they rust. Save up for a couple of higher end Henckels that will last. And don't put them in the dishwasher!"
4,As Advertised,"Buying on-line has one major drawback and that is the inability of the buyer to test the product before making the decision. Whenever your purchase comes as advertised, you have made an excellent buy. This knife set qualifies as just that."
3,A bit small,"When I bought these, I was expecting big-ole BLACK ANGUS type knives. You know, the big steak knives you get at steak houses? These are not those knives. In fact, my butter knives are bigger than these puppies. However, they work."
4,strong killer sounds,"this is the third best killer whale cd i have encountered only bettered by orcinus orca, and blackfish sound, i have about twenty whale cds, i reject any whale cd with music totally, happy listening."
3,"Enjoyable, but not as beautiful as Humpbacks","If you're someone who likes listening to different albums by the same band to note and enjoy their change through the years, then pick up this album with one featuring Humpback whales. The contrast and similarities are rich and enjoyable."
2,Instantly Forgettable,"In the ever-expanding sea of downbeat albums, UKO drift with the plankton. I'd read that these guys are likely to fill the void left by off-the-sceners Kruder and Dorfmeister but it's the very quality that has crowned K&D the 'chill-out' royalty that UKO have forgotten to include in their mix. Tunes.Songs meld into each other leaving in their wake dubby bass, bog-standard breakbeats and pointless sampled snippets. As instantly forgettable as their moniker I'm afraid.Collectives bringing something new to a saturated genre are Eighteenth Street Lounge label's Blue States which veer more towards John Barry style movie soundtracks and anything from Manchesters Grand Central label (try one of their compilations first.)"
3,Good for the price,"You get what you pay for with these. At first I was excited to see that such inexpensive glasses came with a little case but it was a nice touch. They seemed pretty solid and looked nice, but I can't wear them sadly because my pair smelled strongly of factory chemicals. I don't know if I just got unlucky or what, but I was disappointed to find this out when I first tried wearing them."
5,This album will definately get me thru till the DP's 3rd album drops,"I saw the show in philly 7/5/2005 and it felt like it was history in the making. It was like the Beatles reuniting. The show was amazing, they performed practically every song off of both albums, they did their new stuff, Mecca did her solo stuff, Butterfly did his solo stuff and they performed for 2 HOURS straight and came back for an encore for ANOTHER half hour for about 8 songs. I got plenty of pictures and Ladybug signed her album for me and gave me a hug. This was the greatest show I have ever been to, and one of the greatest nights I ever had. My only regret is that I didn't save any flim for pictures with Ladybug.And the album is hot to def.Forget 5 stars, IM GIVING THIS A DOGSTAR!!!"
2,very disappointed,I was very disappointed with this purchase they made it look 10 times bigger than the actual size they should be specific when they advertise this if it wasn't for someone out of state i would have return it. He is a fairly big boy he ask what is this a braclet ..so not good at all
3,Soap Opera,"Too much soap opera drama. Good main character. But if I had to watch a ""One Life to Live"" episode, I would rather punish myself in other ways."
3,"Okay, but couldn't get into it","I enjoy the fact that I can download tv shows, and movies. It's relaxing when on a long ride to be able to view a tv show or movie."
4,Covert Affairs Season 2,"Exactly as ordered. Was delivered WAY earlier than expected.Excellent series, good concept. Entertaining. Uses realistic political and technological devices to support the story line."
4,Fun spy work,They fund themselves a talented and pretty protagonist. The stories are engaging and fun. I really liked her heels and wish I was that young.
5,Excellent Program,"I really enjoy this Series. Can't wait for Season 3 to be released. The story has progressed well from the start in Season 1 and it's exciting to see the love interest grow between the 2 main characters - Annie & Augie. If you enjoy spy thrillers and the interaction between people thrown into different situations, requiring all sorts of intervention to save them, then you will really enjoy Covert Affairs. In Australia, it has just started running from the beginning again and even though I have Season 1, I look forward to watching each weekly episode - actually I watch them twice...... If you like Alias, or NCIS, you will enjoy Covert Affairs."
4,New Chapter for Annie?,Nice ending! Shows are starting to link together well with super action. And this looks like a new chapter for Annie as you'll see in the very end. Cool ending. Makes you want to go right to the next episode!
5,An Amazing Season,"Having watched season one of ""Covert Affairs"", there was no doubt in my mind that I had to have season two. Actress Piper Perabo is perfect for the part of Annie. Christopher Gorham, Sendhil Ramamurthy, Anne Dudek, Kari Matchett and Peter Gallagher are perfect for their parts as well. This show features a great cast, adventure, danger, intrigue and romance. ""Covert Affairs"" goes one step beyond all of that by making relationships with family and friends real and important. Each CIA character has the opportunity to portray a little bit of their personal side outside of their job. A nice contrast to the danger and intrigue aspect of the show."
5,What fun!,"This is such a fun, well written show. The acting is great and the adventures amazing. You get lost in the adveture easily and enjoy the ride."
2,Woodworker,"Be careful ordering this JW1319 (5-Pack) I ordered two and thought I would get a total of 10 clamps, nope, I only got two clamps. After a re-order, the same thing, only two clamps for $7.00. Those are some expensive clamps."
1,Why does my university use this book?,"Why does my university use this book? The University of Washington uses this book to weed out the pre med students. Why do they choose this book? Zumdahl purposely wrote this book to be confusing. Try reading pp. 668 through 670 in the fifth edition. He wrote this to be especially confusing by not being consistent with phase signs nor giving clear statements, such as ""When the phase of the right orbital is reversed and combined with the left orbital."" What orbitals is he talking about? The ones on a figure, that happen to be on a different page, which is not in view when reading this page? This book is horrible and is designed for the student to fail. Thank you Zumdahl and UW for trying to ruin chemistry for your students."
4,Pretty Good,"Overall this is a pretty good textbook. Explanations are pretty good, but my chemistry textbooks from high school presented subjects in a more straight-forward and easier to understand way. Also, this textbook is only meant for people who have good knowledge of high school chemistry already."
2,This Ivy Tree needed pruning,"So, I after reading all the superlative reviews of this book, I wished for and received ""Ivy Tree"" as a gift. First off, what was with the font used for this book? It was painful to read. And, anyone who is a lover of mystery books can figure out the plot within the first few pages. I wish I could compare the book to an ivy tree, but if I did, it would I would have to talk only about pruning. Like, cut this book back to its roots and start over. Not even the copy-cat Jane Eyre/Edward Fairfax Rochester, mad wife, fire and scars can make this book worthwhile. If you want to spend time with ivy, come on over to my house, I have some ivy on my back fence that needs to be cut back..."
5,Faithless writer or clueless reader,"Definitely not clueless writer - she left plenty of them.I didn't love this book when I read it. I felt that she betrayed an implied contract with the reader. But then on second reading, I realized that in my rush to devour it all, I had been clueless. So few romance and fiction best-sellers - including Stewart's later contemporary works - demand anything of the reader the way Stewart's early novels did. On the other hand, readers don't get the extra dividends. She leads us by the hand and teaches us that the reason great literature has endured - in this case folk ballads, but in earlier novels Shakespeare and Greek plays - is that they entertain and move us.This book is as richly textured as any of her novels."
2,Dragging....,"I'm currently reading this book. I started on it about a month ago. I'm not even half way through it. No, I'm not busy doing other things. This is the kind of book where I can't even force myself to finish the chapter before I put it down. I would normally finish reading a book this size in a day or two if I liked it. I just can't get into the story. While the writer is very, very descriptive it seems she forgot to add depth to the characters. They seem so one dimensional. I can't care about them, identify with them- nothing."
2,"GOOD FOR MADACY, BUT STILL DISAPPOINTING!","While Madacy may not have digitally remastered their version of Zorro's Fighting Legion, this disc does have decent picture and sound quality. The print is at times a little dark, but overall it is not bad to look at. The biggest problem with Madacy's version is that they not only have cut out the title's beginning and endings, they also removed the chapter recaps as well. This seems an odd choice on their part, considernig all chapter recaps were left in on their Painted Stallion, and New Adventures of Tarzan DVD's. Without the chapter recaps the serial loses some of its flare. I would reccomend waiting for the Image version of the serial. I understand that theirs comes from the original negative."
5,"In my collection, one of the better ones.",I first saw this at 13 now see it at 67. Still holds up for that genre. Lots of well written action scenes. This has the famous stunt under the stagecoach from the team of horses by Canutt. Don Del Oro was a great villan and the music theme was different as well.We enjoyed and still do. My Grandchildren are proof.
2,Enjoyed my 10 year old tape better,"I was going to write my own review but michaeljmoore2 beat me to the punch. My old VHS version of this serial beats this DVD hands down. I still can't understand why the DVD version did not include the synopsis from the previous chapter. For me, this was one of the fun parts of the serial. It can't be because they ran out of space on the DVD since there are two DVDs with this set. Go figure."
2,Republic's Best Serial,I first saw ZFL on tv in 1953 when the networks were looking to fill time slots. Yakima Canutt's one of a kind stunt in chapter 7- falling under the moving stagecoach convinced me that I wanted to be a stuntman when I grew up. The climax- Don Diego and Don Del Oro in hand-to-hand combat- rolling around the floor of the ceremonial cave until Zorro pulls off the Golden God's helmut revealing ? as the villian. I've seen all of Republic's serials & none show the hero & villian fighting it out during the conclusion. The very best serial ever. ZFL ranks as my favorite movie of the century. Look how often scenes for modern movies have been taken from ZFL. I highly recommend it. 5 stars- the very best rating.
1,"POOR SELECTION FOR A ""BEST OF""","What a disappointment! It does cover his work from the 60s to the early 90s... however, this is more a collection of his singles and the selections from the 80s are POOR choices!! Nothing from ""Cat People"" ""Scarface"" ""Flashdance"" ""Top Gun"" -- unbelievable!! His most accomplished works from the 80s are on those albums!! Instead they stuck in some boring 80s tracks including one from the 84 Olympics called ""reach out"" which is horribly shallow in music and lyrics -- i am a fan of Giorgio Moroder and was highly disappointed with the selections -- Now, if you are interested in a collection of his singles then this is the album to buy - but if you want to hear his best stuff i recommend the albums i already mentioned above as well as ""From Here to Eternity"" ""E=Mc2"" and ""Midnight Express"" which are great electronic feats!"
4,decent overview,"Stylistically, this collection is all over the place; covering Giorgio's early pop and rock material to his better known electronic and dance compositions. Sure, it's an uneven collection, but there are enough quality tunes on here (and you are not short-changed by the amount of music; it's an hour-plus) to satisfy me."
2,Knights and Ladies for Children,"This is an action packed account about Knights and Ladies. They fight all the time, but amazingly no one get killed. It seems mostly made for children."
3,"Eh, it was ok",I read this for my GT class. It was only fair...I think if I read it a few years from now I would appreciate it more.
2,Ivanhoe sucks,"I thought that it was a really boring book. It was hard to read because it was like scriptures. They say thy, thou ,ye, and all that crazy stuff. It sucked"
4,Good classic read,I saw the movie when I was a kid and now I have read the book and the book is better. Very enjoyable and I learned a lot about the time period and the Templars. May be difficult for someone young due to the old style of writing but well worth your time.
3,Enjoyable!,"This classic novel includes all the archetypes of a medieval story: knights, castles, tournaments, battles, damsels in distress, etc. Amusingly _ with debatable concern for historical accuracy _ it also includes famous characters such as Richard the Lion Heart, Prince John, Robin Hood and Friar Tuck.Strangely, narration is not linear and often the action is rewound to look at the same events a second time, from the perspective of different characters. This makes things a bit difficult to follow, especially in audio format. There is also a surprising emphasis on Isaac and Rebecca, of Jewish faith, who appear practically more prominently than Ivanhoe himself. It must be mentioned as well that there is a strong anti-Catholic bias, the Church, its priests and its rituals being somewhat ridiculed throughout the work.Still the result is entertaining and those unfamiliar with this famous work will not be disappointed."
5,A fine read,"Scott's Ivanhoe ranks among my favorite books. Although the language can be a bit difficult(and sometimes humorous), the story and characters make Ivanhoe well worth the trouble. This is a fast moving and thoroughly enjoyable old-fashioned adventure story."
5,Historical fiction at its finest...,"A great cast of characters, all lovingly crafted and memorable. The book is filled with drama, adventure and humor not taking itself too seriously while set in one of the most interesting times of England (the time leading up to Hastings being the most interesting - ahem, did you hear that Bernard Cornwell?). Sadly, there are not many books like this out there.There are a lot of disguises used which might be overdone. And the penguin version does not have the notes on the corresponding page but in the back of the book. There is a free version on google books with the notes on each page which is more convenient and the author's side comments were actually very interesting at times. Don't sell yourself short, go ahead and read this."
2,Where does commentary start and narrative begin?,There is no clear place where the extensive commentaries end and the actual story begins. I had to search thru a LOT of pages and a couple of false starts to find the beginning of Ivanhoe.
5,Worth the effort!,"Although it's true that this book might not be the easiest to read, it is definitely worth putting in the effort. Once you let yourself get into it and figure out how to get the meaning out of some of the ""fancy"" language that it's written in, it is really very enjoyable, with everything you could wish for in a knightly tale."
2,Poor sound,"Amazon's reviewer's comments notwithstanding I found the sound quality of this recording unaccaptable. The sound is muddy, and there are a lot of noises. I have other live opera recordings from the same period and they are much better. After just a few listenings I was so dissapointed I had to get another performance to replace this one (Scotto on EMI - great!). Beware."
3,A bargain recording for fans of Scotto,"It has to be said that the sound quality on this live broadcast isn't brilliant but it does have atmosphere and though there are better studio versions(Tebaldi's second recording with Bergonzi is particularly recommendable)one can readily warm to it, Scotto though occasionally rough edged develops this hapless character with great vocal inteligence indeed her unique qualities are ideally suited to Butterfly and she gives a truly heart rendering final scene,Cioni isn't in her league but he does manage to shade his voice beautifully in places,the other singers are fine without being outstanding but this live bargain recording is mainly for Scotto fans."
5,Greater than Great! Better than Best!,"It's a real funny book. It makes me go back to the old days when I bought my first issue of MAD magazine. Actually, no, because I pretty much have alot of Bathroom Companions and this is one of 'em. Very Entertaining or your money back! It's so funny, you feel like you don't have to ""go"" anymore!"
1,Franke Little Butler,"I agree with Mr Vaughn. This is my third replacement in 5 years. The first failed after 2 years, leaking and destroying my brand new cabinet floor. This one is now disintegrating and white material in now in the hot water. Zero customer service from the mfgr. Thanks to Mr Vaughn's review I will search for a replacement from another manufacturer. By the way, i am dissatisfied with all the Franke products (deep double ss sink that stains like crazy, expensive designer faucet that broke in less than 2 years, and the infernal Butler) that I installed in my $100,000 kitchen.Franke : Triflow Series TFT389 Traditional FaucetFranke : Triflow Series TFT400 Traditional Faucet"
1,Poor Quality Zero Customer Service,"Bought this 5 years ago and had it installed which cost well over $500. It has stopped working and absolute zero customer service. Asked Customer Service how to fix it and was told no you just have to replace it. Nice, $100.+ cost per year for a cheap hot water heater."
1,Franke Failure,"The plumbers just left. After 2 years, another Franke Failure. After fixing the same leak last year, I sent away for the kit from Franke and it arrived. The unit began to leak so I called the plumbers and had them install the fix. Problem now is that the inlet has a pressed in washer were can't get to so they have capped it all and I am off to buy another one...but, it won't be a Franke."
2,Nice when it works!,"After 5 years of owning the Franke Little Butler, it started leaking form the bottom of the unit. I researched the unit on the internet, and found specs and diagrams. I called the company, but they were of zero help. So I opened the unit, and found that the part that was leaking was a cheap piece of plastic. I found a metal version of the same part at the local hardware store, and installed it. Wasn't too hard. It fixed the leak, and the unit heated up again. But then the unit's temp controller wasn't functioning properly, and the only temperature produced was so hot that it caused the pressure release feature to activate-- causing scalding hot water to hiss from the Franke spigot (and scaring the heck out of my wife and kids!!) So i'm browsing the internet for either reasonably priced Franke unit or an alternative mini hot water heater. Does anyone know of a more reliable replacement for the Franke heating tank?!"
1,Reputation for quality counts--I'm disappointed by reviews,"I had a Franke instant hot water dispenser installed about 5 years ago when I renovated my kitchen. About a year and a half ago it started leaking so I just turned off the water and stopped using it. When the plumber came out the other day for an unrelated problem, I asked him to take a look at the hot water dispenser to see if he could fix it. His advice was to replace it and suggested that I go to Amazon to check out prices. However, from the reviews I'm reading, I don't think I want to buy another Franke product. If Franke monitors customer feedback, it should be ashamed to hear what's being said about the quality and service of it's products. Meanwhile I think I'll either replace it with another brand or simply use my Keurig coffee maker and not even worry about it. To my way of thinking, reputation is everything and these reviews turn me off to your company and hence your product."
1,Not reliable,"When working, the Franke Little Butler performs as advertized. The problem is, they don't last. My first one went out after about 4 years, my 2nd one after 18 months. Unfortunately, the warranty is only one year. I'll be searching for a replacement from a different manufacturer. By the way, I've had their faucet too and just replaced it with a Moen, which in my opinion is a much better product."
1,Leaked after 26 months,"We had one installed in February, 2010 and it started leaking in April, 2012. Unfortunately, most of the reviews here were made after I started the purchase process. I took the unit apart and it looks like the inlet fitting that is in the corner broke. Unfortunately, this is a plastic part, so there is no easy way to replace it. I know that heaters do not last forever, but it should have last longer, I would expect 5 years. I'm looking for another manufacturer. I recommended that this unit be installed locally, two other units were installed. Now I'm going to recommend that the Franke tanks be replaced pro-actively so as to avoid failure. Franke, you have a PR problem here."
1,Do NOT Purchase!,"This Franke water heater has all plastic fittings that are ill-fitting and it was very difficult to get the heater to be leak-free. I eventually went to the hardware store with the unit and asked for the appropriate fittings to install the heater. He sold me the fittings and then showed me a heater he had in stock with the fittings I purchased. The unit in the store was far cheaper. Also, I paid for one-day shipping and received it in four days. This is not a product that I would recommend to a friend--or even an enemy for that matter."
1,Franke-nstein,"Thanks, Frank. My Franke HT-200 leaked after less than two years and ruined my wood kitchen cabinets. I strongly suggest that you not buy the Franke HT-200 Little Butler Instant hot water unit (or any Franke water heater, considering their failure to properly stand behind their own product)."
2,Jury is still out...,My plumber came this week to install this unit for one of my clients. The client has reported that the unit and/or faucet is sputtering when discharging the hot water as if there is air in the supply lines. Still trouble shooting it...not sure if it is the heater or the faucet yet. Will update when resolved.
1,"Overpriced, poor quality, no customer service","Franke is great for aesthetic design, and I love my Franke sink. But the Little Butler water heater developed a leak in under 5 years, and the Franke faucet started falling apart soon after. I'm sticking with Moen or Delta (lifetime warranty on faucet & great customer service) for faucets and switching to Insinkerator for hot water dispenser and filter. Insinkerator filters are half the price of Franke."
3,Been there and met him in many offices,"Markert is the typical corporate a-hole. He is the reason why 90 % of employees loath Monday mornings. On the positive side, he and his type encourage employees to quit their jobs and start their own businesses (or to avoid the corporate world altogether) like Starbucks or Google. Places where employees actually enjoy working, aren't humiliated into compliance, feel appreciated and empowered.The results are obvious..For that, I thank you Tom."
3,Useful book,"Hi All,This book is more practical oriented and written with his vast experience from a junior level to a CEO. It will be a good guide to those who want to climb up the career ladder .Thanks,Suresh."
3,Safety Power Switch,"The concept is a good one, the ability to turn off your saw without using your hands. If you are guiding stock through your saw and something hangs up you can shut down with a knee or convenient body part. It mounts nicely on the Rousseau PM2700XL. What's missing is a second outlet for the shop vac. My table is used in field applications, where I hookup a standard shop vac to my Makita 2703 with an adapter. The sound of the vac and the inconvenice of adapting the Switch with a grounded 3 plug adapter keep this from being 5 star."
5,Safety switch review.,I bought this to use on my new router table. It went on easy and works good. I would buy again.
1,rks,"The one that I got did not work. There was no power going to the recept. I did not want to take another chance on the 2nd one,because of the lack & slowness of contact from the supplying company. I had no problem with Amazon, they did credit my account."
3,Missing music,"What is the name of this music?In the movie there was a music which I cannot find inthe sound track its missing or maybe its not from soundtrackYou can find it in the movie in time 80m:50s ,The scene starts when Penelope Cruz starts chopping a red sweet pepper ??Any info would be helpful , Thanks a lot"
2,Only Las Espigadoras,I purchased this CD just for Las Espigadoras. The rest is not that good. I was expecting more songs.
4,Loved it,"I bought this CD right after I saw the movie. I love Pedro; anything he does I""ll support. My only problem with the soundtrack CD is the song Volver. I love the song. I would have rather heard Penelope Cruz it instead of Estrella Morenta. Don't get me wrong I love Estrella Morente, I have a few of her CD's, but the way Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) sings it in the movie has more feeling.Overall, loved it"
4,Nice packaging,"The blue pouch, the box and the caring card were really nice. But by the time it arrived, the thin necklace had mostly slided out of the pouch and tangled up a little with the poly-filling of the box. I ordered the 18-inch necklace, but for the one I received, its actual length was 19.5 inches, including the clasp."
2,these shows are on other better collections,the transfers on these disc's are not very good and you can find the same shows on other collections and they have better looking transfers. not worth the money
3,Not Impressed,You might be happier to find the shows you enjoy and get the series. These seem to ramble a bit. I prefer the series products much more.
5,Great laser level.....lousy on /off switch,"I Just got the tool and I use it for many building projects. I can not imagine working without it. This is a very handy and useful tool. I like it's small size and it is very easy to read. The laser is powerful and accurate. It is very well built and feels luxurious in your hand.My only gripe is the on/off switch. It needs a clear indent for the off mode. It is very tempromental and would rather be ON all the time. Not very secure for transporting or using as a regular level.I called Porter Cable to report this, they immediately sent me a New switch...............which has the same problem.I love the magnetic base. makes for handy placement on steel or as an ""in your face ""storege option while waitiing for it's next assignment.I use the tool often.........I just wish I could count on the switch to stay in the ""OFF"" mode when I do not want the red laser to be on.Fix the switch and this tool belongs in the ""Tool Hall of Fame"".chris slye"
5,Great design and value,The photo in Amazon is WRONG as it only shows one beam but this actually has three (as the description says). The quality is fantastic and so easy to use. I got mine just in time to build a fence in the front yard and this will make it so much easier. I've seen other laser levels with less features for more $. And it's a great cat toy *ha* (shine the light on the wall and watch the cat go nuts - just don't get it in their eye.
4,Handy little laser for the price,"Bought one to use for running a gutter extension 60'. Put it on a tripod, leveled it, and then just walked along with a 48"" rule checking the drop every pipe. Couldn't be easier.As the other reviewers have mentioned, the ""on/off"" switch is unscrewing the battery cover. Kinda lame considering how well designed it is otherwise.Besides the leveling plate, the bottom has several magnets which really held. I didn't need to screw it to the tripod, just placed it there."
3,Also consider Dewalt's DW099 ($90). It has a better switch.,"Because of reviewers' concerns about the on/off switch on the Robotoolz laser level, I purchased the Dewalt DW099 laser level instead. It very similar to the Robotoolz model, but it seems to have a switch that is less likely to be accidentally turned on, and which does not automatically turn off. Also, if necessary the switch can be replaced - it costs about $20 through Dewalt. The level itself is available at Amazon for the MSRP's of $90 here:DEWALT DW099 Heavy-Duty 3-Beam Stick Laser Level"
4,"Beautiful voice, great selections...","This recording of Youngok Shin is really excellent, both for her tone and technique, and for the selection of music on it. There are many beautiful songs you don't normally find at all, let alone together on one CD. Some of my favorites are La promessa, Oh! quand je dors, Chanson triste, and Zdes' Khorosho. I originally purchased the CD to help me learn some repertoire, and found additional repertoire ideas on the disc. Shin gives a beautiful performance that is exactly right for this music; it isn't overdone at all. I'm really tired of opera singers turning art songs into some dramatic opera scene, or making them so ""big"" that we can't even hear the poetry anymore. Please remember that art songs are a partnership between singer and pianist; both play nearly equal roles. Lovely job, Ms. Shin."
4,understanding your horses foot,"This book is an excellent guide if you would like to know more about corrective shoeing and the benefits it has. It was very informative, and had many pictures that were a big help in understanding the concepts they were explaining. I would have liked for the book to discuss nutritional or supplemental ways of establishing a healthier foot, but it was only mentioned briefly, and without much depth. Overall I felt the book was well worth the read if you are interested in correcting lameness through remedial shoeing."
1,outdated,"Within the last few years, great progress has been made in healing horses using barefoot trimming methods. It is possible to cure hoof problems fast and for good, but this book doesn't include any of these methods (yet). I can therefore not recommend it."
4,Amazing!!,"This movie was awesome and really captivated my senses. I feel like right now all of my dreams are possible because most of the people in this video are my age or less. Lousis Lautman does an excellent job interviewing these outrageously successful young entrpreneurs!! I had to only take one star away though because I was looking for this guy named Carl Cupid who wrote a book entitled ""But, What if I fail?"" and is making millions as a young dynamic entrepreneur, I just knew he would be on the documentary, but he wasn't there :( maybe next time. Overall watch this documentary and your life will never be the same. Peace and love!"
5,Buy It!,"This is no doubt the best explanatory book on Tibetan Buddhismaround. It may me a little bit hard to read for those withlow IQ's. And since you are reading one of my reviews, I mustassume that you do have a low IQ. But don't worry about it.This book is just the very best. It makes everything clear about the subject matter. And it basically covers everything that you will need. It does so in a very systematic manner.And Wallace writes in a very clear mathematical manner (he is a physicist). I do believe that you will enjoy reading this book like I did. But better yet, I think that it will make a very complicated subject easy to understand. It's quite an accomplishment. This is my favorite book on explaining Tibetan Buddhism. Not one that I would just hand out to beginners. But one that I would hand out to very smart beginners. Pleasebuy and enjoy."
5,Honest Account from the Heart,"Charles Colson has channeled his Ivy League education and rich array of life experience as a USMC officer, corporate attorney, White House counsel, and political prisoner to serve for over 30 years as one of the most intelligent and articulate spokesman for Christian principles. In this lucid and heartfelt biography, this modest man reveals how he braved a clearly unjust prison sentence to transform a horrific experience into a lifetime calling for inspiring millions. Colson's mastery of the English language makes the account read like a novel."
4,From Palace to Prison to a Higher Kingdom,"This is an ineresting story based on the life and times of Chuck Colson. Touched by a Billy Graham revival, Chuck (as played by Dean Jones, star of The Love Bug) re-evaluates his life and all the success. As he winds up in prison, he is able to share the Good News with others. I saw this movie a long time ago and have great respect for Mr. Colson, a man who has a good heart for those in prison (and for those interested in helping out with his ministry, check out Prison Fellowship)."
5,guided imagery for the pagan,This is an excellent resource for anyone and a source of wonderful sabbat meditations to use yourself or to share as a group experience. Especially helpful for those hosting or teaching.
2,Obvious first attempt at romance,"Mrs. Holmes's first attempt at a writing a romance novel is laudable for several reasons. She has an excellent command of the English language and many of her descriptive paragraphs are wonderful. Her inclusion of Italian poetry is lovely.However, the book demonstrates little awareness of human nature. Situations are contrived, unbelieveable.The story line is poor and at times laughable. The use of the Italian language, although lovely poetic pieces, does little to support the plot."
2,Am I the only one who feels like this?,"Mrs. Holmes is to be commended for writing a romance which demonstrates her facility at writing descriptive paragraphs. Her inclusion of lovely Italian poetry is a nice touch. However, the characters are totally unbelieveable. That you could mistake your old uncle's voice and that of a handsome young stranger is laughable. Books shows no understanding of human nature and logical progression of events at all. Poetry, though nice, does nothing whatsoever to enhance the storyline.How someone could assign a 5 star review is beyond me."
5,Must-have!,"I cannot say enough about this recording, so in order to not write on and on I will be as breif as possible. The cast is excellent!!! Just amazing! It is great to see the torch being passed from Varnay to Nillson! Act Two is a non-stop tour-de-force. Anyone who refers to Lohengrin as ""Slow-and-grim,"" will be eating crow after listening to this performance. Varnay is THE Ortrud in my opinion, only challanged by Leonie Rysanek in the latter half of her career. Varnay's gargantuan voice personifies the blood-thirsty presence of Orturd, and the curse is simply amazing."
5,review,arrived promptly and as promised. was in excellent condition and well packaged. a thoroughly satisfactory transaction. five stars to the vendor and my thanks!
4,"A very good book,",This book is succinct and simple but full of usefull information. It helped my clinical skills significantly. I highly recommend it to everyone.
4,Murder in the Cotswolds!,"A successful mystery writer moves to the Cotswolds to get out of the bustle of London. Little does she know that this will put her in the middle of a real life murder mystery that she helps to solve. With the help of her quirky neighbor, Melissa stumbles on some secrets that others want to stay hidden and onto the identity of the real killer.This was a great start to the series. I enjoyed watching Melissa gain her independence from an ex-lover and learning how to do things for herself. The neighbor was a delight with her vegetarian (but not preachy), healthy lifestyle, and the next books in the series promise to show more of these great characters. Great, light reading. Enjoy!"
2,Another cooling fan failure for an otherwise great tool.,"I'm the typical doityourselfer and I certainly think I do not use the Rotozip for more than it was intended, but recently it started sounding like something was loose and scraping inside of it while in use (a very unpleasant and alarming sound). Like other reviewers, I opened up my Rotozip to discover the cooling fan rubbing up against the housing. Years ago, I paid over $200 for my Rotozip and am pretty angry that such a potentially dangerous flaw would find its way into such a widely sold product. Aside from attempting the Loctite fix, I'll probably replace this tool with a Craftsman brand rotorary cutting tool simply because it would seem that brand would make a difference in this case - especially if you plan to use a product for more than a few years. I will never endorse Rotozip tools should anyone ever ask me."
4,"Good tool, but not perfect.","This tool has come in very handy for me and my workers. It's been great for removing cracked ceramic tile in showers (using masonary disk), cutting stucco, etc. If you get one, make sure you ALWAYS wear safety goggles. The one time I didn't I had a piece of stucco hit my eyeball and it was extremely painful (am fortunate it hit the white part of the eye).What I dislike about this tool is the on/off switch. It is so bad that I could see someone having an accident with it. The switch is a slippery piece of plastic that you have to pull to turn it on and it's not easy to get a grip on.I also don't like the cheesy plastic case. The mfg. should include a metal case or at a minimum a quality plastic case.I haven't had great luck with the bits (they always seem to break).Even though there are a couple negative things about this tool, I would definitely buy it again. It has become indispensable to me and gets used regularly in renovating apartment units."
2,Infomercial Hype,"...It in not a heavyduty tool. I did not see any adjustment in speed by the electronics to keep the speed constant. There was a lot of play/vibration in the bearings. The metal cut off disks are [costly]and do not last as long as the ones on my other tools, and you have to buy their brand to fit..."
3,Rotozip Burn Out,"I just wanted to confirm what a few others have said here. The Zip works great with one problem, the fan. If you buy one of these and actually use it more than the average Joe be ready to fix the fan. I have had two and exactly as stated in prior reviews, the unit gets hot and the glue holding the fan in place loosens allowing the fan to slip down the shaft and into the housing. The first time this happened I just had it replaced. The second time I had read these reviews and decided to open it up. I found exactly what other reviewers have stated. I too am using bearing retaining compound to glue the fan back in place. You can get it from Loctite. I recommend using the kind for high heat."
2,not all it is cracked up to be,"If you want to cut electrical outlets in drywall and have extra [money] lying around by the saw. The bits dull remarkably fast. It has a great deal of kick back as do most rotorary tools like the dremel, which I find unsafe. Cutting metal pipe is tricky at best, the sanding is mediocare compared with any dedicated sander and as a grinder it is underpowered. Cutting wood is extremely slow if you don't want to break the blade which means you need hearing protection it whines louder than my exwife. it is very difficult to make an accurate cut. does fine for rough stuff."
1,jhip,"if you order a size 10.5 mens, this pair of shoes will cost you an extra $25! that is outrageous!"
2,"durable but, caused foot pain","I bought these because they were so well priced. They are durable, however I have foot pain for the first time ever."
5,thanks,Great pair of safety shoes very comfortable like walking on air and great quailty very good product thank you so much
2,Honey Almond Soap Not Quite For Me,"I was looking forward to using this soap as I love the smell of almond, but I ended up throwing it out after the third time I used it. It smells lovely and is a really nice size bar, but the grains in the soap just tore up my skin. You really don't notice the grains much the first time you use it, but by the third time it was really uncomfortable. And I never thought of my skin as particularly sensitive. The soap also leaves grains in the tub, so it's probably best used in the shower if you like this type of soap."
3,Carb Counters Hot Cereal,"This is ok, if you like the taste of soybeans and soy products, you will like it, if not, then don't try it. It has a very large soy 'fake' taste. It did have an oatmeal texture and a little bit of oatmeal taste. It wasn't bad, and if you miss your oatmeal, it is certainly a good substitute."
2,"Great acting, poor excuse for a story line","Considering the cast, I had such high hopes for this movie. And while the cast did indeed dazzle, the adaptions made to the original story were unnecessary and down right ridiculous. The writer decided making the squire into something he never was was more important than showing the evil of the pirates as they trounced over all the good men on the crew. A very dark, unsettling adaptation too. Not for younger viewers. Stick with the Disney version for kids under 10 or so."
4,"Treasure this "" Treasure Island!""","This is a charming, dramatic and splendid interpretation of Robert Louis Stevenson's 'Treasure Island'.I found the cast delightful and imaginative with dark, tough, superstitious, violent yet charismatic pirates and the lure of magical untold riches just around the bend. Eddie Izzard is perfectly cast as John Silver (he's a pirate I'd certainly follow) and the representatives of 'society and justice' are as cruel, violent and arbitrary as the pirates they fight against. There are no easy heroes or simple villains in this film. Full of charm and fine actors such as Rupert Penry Jones and Elijah Woods, this is a wonderful treat!"
2,The trappings matter,"I was excited to see this, being a big fan of the book and the original movie version. This one would seem to have all the elements: a faithful adaptation of a great story, and a good cast. Yet it failed pretty dramatically in my view. Why? Mainly the trappings.It didn't ""feel"" like a pirate movie. None of the cast acted like pirates. It felt like it was shot in somebody's summer cabin rather than on a tropical island. I didn't even buy it as a period piece, it seemed much more modern. And then they made inexplicable changes to the characters. The doctor is now a really pathetic coward (why?) And Jim is very duplicitous. And instead of being a generally likeable bumbler, the Squire is now this evil schemer. I don't understand, and certainly don't like the changes.Bah, well, hopefully somebody else will make another attempt."
2,"""Educative"" Effort ..","This movie manages to happily ruin a great classic like Treasure Island.. and this in spite of a great cast that is just spot on for the role.. acting, attitude, atmosphere.. it's all right.. it's just the story that sucks, because .. yeah they changed it.they actually did feel the need to change it..and how? After all the suffering and deaths to find to treasure and when they are starting to sail back home Jim has the brilliant idea of throwing all the treasure overboard. Really great idea, so that it was all for nothing! But there's a high moral standard at stake here.. and I am afraid that it is ""the poor and noble should remain noble, but above all he should remain poor"". Very educative. I' will let you figure out by yourself whose interests this ""morality"" serves..."
3,Fails to folllow the book.,There was no reason to make Squire John Trelawney into a bad person. There was nothing bad about him in the book. Seeing the the movie was long enough it could have followed the book more and been true to the characters. The actors and quality of the film were good enough for a better movie.
5,A Must Have for Distributed Programming,"I have been working with .Net Remoting for a couple months and this book has more detailed information in it, than I could find anywhere. Not only did it help reinforce the fundamentals of remoting, it explores many advanced topics and gives easy to follow examples. The approach is practical and direct even with difficult topics. This book saved me hours of time by explaining in depth delegates and remote callbacks. I highly suggest this book for anyone working with remoting, web services or other distributed programming topics.Also, the code used in the examples can be downloaded from the book's website in C# or VB.NET."
1,Disappointing to say the least!,"Being a Roman history buff I really enjoyed the first two books in the series and was looking to forward to the third. Boy was I disappointed, so much so that I stopped reading with only thirty pages or so left. I just lost total interest. There were too many things that strained credibility. Unlike a previous post, them going to Germania and just start speaking German all of a sudden was ridiculous. That's believable? Yeah right. But what really annoyed me the most was the character of Rizpah. She was the most self-righteous, holier-than-thou character I can remember from any book I've read. The more I read of her the angrier I got.The first two book were well written and inspirational, but ""As Sure as the Dawn"" turned out to be a overblown, melodramatic, credibility-challenged dud."
2,Not as good as the first two,"I have read the first two books in this series and I really didn't enjoy this one as much as the others. I was bored with the book almost from the start. I would recomend the first two, A Voice in the Wind and An Echo in the Darkness, but not this one."
5,Sure as the Dawn,"Finishes of the 3 set serises just right. The best christian novel I've read in a long time. Follows the Bible stories as they were then, brings that time in our history to life.makes me wish I had the faith of some of the early christains as told in these three books. Although fiction, because it is bible based it brings things we have learnt about Christs lifeand what he can do for us more to mind. A book every Christian should read. I'll be passing them along to my friends."
5,Get ready to cry!,Loved this story of unconditional love. If you like historical novels you will love this one. Francine Rivers is a Christian writer so she weaves a wonderful tale.
4,Good ending to the story,"I have all three books in the series. This one involved some of the characters from the first book and was relevant to the first two. Sometimes a little tedious, but the author probably felt it was necessary to get the message of salvation across. It might could be a good movie..."
5,As Sure as the Dawn,I really enjoyed all three of this series. It was nice to read about another great man.I recommed this 3 book series
5,Outstanding Story!,Excellent book. Well written story that brings bible times to life.Book 3 of a series. I loved the first 2 as well. Read them all!
5,Great series!! Brilliantly written!,Wonderful book in the Mark Of The Lion series! These books are certainly a blessing!Francine Rivers is an anointed woman of God with a blessed anointing on the books she writes!
4,Good End to Amazing Series!,"This book completes the story of Atretes, the slave/gladiator that we are introduced to in Voice in the Wind. I almost decided against reading this book because my favorite character Haddasah is not featured. I'm glad I changed my mind. While this was not quite as good as the first two in the series, it was a great read and a fitting end to the series. I loved the development of Atretes & Rizpah's relationship and the book was full of twists and turns. I cried with the first two books, and while this book did not draw tears, I did find myself wanting to leap for joy at some parts. If you enjoyed the first two books in the series, I recommend that you read this book - you'll likely be sad that it doesn't include Hadassah, but Atretes' story is just as amazing!"
4,Romantic but Disjointed,"If you have read the other two portions of the Mark of the Lion trilogy, this is a suitable ending piece and to complete all the stories that were introduced in A Voice in the Wind. However, because it only focuses on the story of Atretes, it seems a little disjointed from the other two. Nevertheless, it is a powerful story that continues to possess Rivers' powerful writing style and prose punctuated with Biblical references and longings for the romantic as well as plot troubles. It is still all well-done though, at least in my copy, it appears that the ditor got a little tired by the third book as more grammatical errors exist. Nevertheless, I am still a huge fan! I just preferred the two previous books to this third which most will still want to read."
3,"The worst of the series, but still okay.","This book dragged for me. It was extremely preachy. It follows Artretes' path from slavery to basically preacher. It follows his path long and drudgingly. If you decide to read this you will need to pace yourself. This isn't the kind of book you read or want to read without putting it down. You will enjoy it, but it is flowery at times and very preachy. At about half the way in the book slows down even more, then it finally picks up about 100 pages from the end.Be prepared for the slump in the book and the preachiness and you will basically enjoy a good story, but not a must read."
5,Love this series,"Awesome, Francine Rivers word flow from the page leading me closer to the Lord. Beautifully written I recommend it to everyone!!"
5,The unexpected,A slow start to the book but still as intriguing and thrilling as the last two books. A story of lost hope in life but the redeeming grace of God that can soften the heart of the biggest giants.
5,Read the whole series!,I love all three books. I got book one from a friend and then bought the final two books. This is the kind of series that makes you want it to keep going. Francine Rivers is a great writer and has some of the best historical Christian fiction I have ever read!
4,Amazon Provides Series Completion,I was really surprised by the plot of the third book. And a little troubled. How awful life can be. It's interesting to me that recently a gladiator training 'camp' was identified near the area where the story took place. It helped me to visualize more clearly what life must have been for those sent into the training.
3,Incredibly too much of the same and too long and too detailed....,"I'm glad I'm in the minority among reviewers because I like Francine Rivers' writing in general. The reader was excellent (Audible)--no complaints there. However, by the third book of perfect Christianity among wicked idol worshippers (I don't question that), the details of evil versus perfection were too many and too typical and too predictable and too endless. I listened to the entire trilogy during my summer walks. By the end of this third book, I sped up the recording and started skipping chapters. I checked in often enough to know there were incredible miracles at the end. Once again. And that's my point. Too much that was incredible became repetitive, predictable and, yes--boring. The first two books were more enjoyable because I didn't always know what was coming."
4,Not what I'd hoped....,"Not gonna' lie, I was disappointed when I found this third book of the series to be based on Atretes and not around Hadassah and Marcus. I had grown to really enjoy those characters and wanted to read about their next adventure together with Christ as their center. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case..It was still a good book and was hard to put down, but I found myself wishing it had been different."
3,feedback,"the service was great and seller sent book right away i,d give them an a+. book 3 of the series is the least of my favorites. it was ok but not as good as 1 and 2."
5,Amazing series!!!,Loved this series!! Definitely start with the first book and read through all three! I would highly recommend this book to everyone.
1,Poor Book -- Don't waste your time or money,I bought this book hoping to learn something -- I didn't. There is no useful information in this book if you are going to be involved in caring for a mare and her foal.This is a nice book for absentee owners who want to talk about their mare and foal at cocktail parties. This is a great book for an 8 year old girl who dreams of having a horse and foal of her own (but who never will). This is not an acceptable book for children who will really be around horses -- the pictures show too many examples unsafe practices.
4,Log Home Contractor,"This is a fabulous tool. I use as many cordless tools as I can because I hate listening to my generator and compressor running all the time. Bostitch has made a top of the line tool with this one. The battery will lay about 2 1/2 square of shingles without a recharge and with two batteries one can be charging at all times so you never run out of power. The tool is loud but not as loud as a generator, it is a bit on the heavy side but much better than having that air hose in tow and the way it holds in your hand you barely notice the weight. You have to buy the nails in the in the plastic canisters which only cost on average two dollars more per box but if you are a real miser you can buy regular coil roof nails and reload the canisters. If you are like me and want to use cordless as much as possible and you do many roofs this is a great alternative to pneumatic. I have literally waited for years for this tool. . . thank you Stanley Bostitch."
4,Great pictures of galaxies & simple explainations for children,"This book provides great pictures of galaxies & simple explainations for children. When I taught 3rd grade astronomy, I looked through all the books I could find on galaxies. I liked the stories and illustrations from My Place in Space by Robin HirstMy Place in Spaceand Galaxies, Galaxies by Gail GibbonsGalaxies, Galaxies!; however, this was the best book with actual photographs. I especially loved the picture that shows the Milky Way and has a tiny dot to show where our sun & solar system is located. Even after reading the story books to my children, it wasn't until I showed them that photograph, did the kids gasp as theyrealized how tiny were really are in this enormous cosmos."
2,Poor Pictures,"With allthe great photos available of the universe and it's galaxies, the pictures in this book terrible."
2,Galaxies a dud,"Do not like the book. Took a gamble there would be some reference information I could use as an amateur astronomer...NOT. Its a kids book. Poor quality pictures. I have seen quality galaxy pictures and these were not it. Big type to take up space. Very basic descriptions. I already knew 95% what author wrote. Very disappointed. Will give book to my nephew as birthday present. That way his mom can show him the pictures and read the basic descriptions.At least someone will get enjoyment from it. No real substance to use as a reference book. Good for a 7 or 8 year old only. Even if your a new amateur astronomer you will want more meat and potatoes about Galaxies than this book offers.Save your money on this one. You can find a better book on Galaxies for grownups. Book is good for young children or parents showing and reading to young children,"
3,"Needed a little work, but decent product for the price","I bought this wig because it was one of the least expensive ones on Amazon. It arrived in good time, but it was a little choppy--the bangs weren't even, and there were a couple 1"" chunks just above the bangs, before the longer part started. It was also about 1 1/2"" - 2"" longer on me than it appears in the photo, so I ended up giving it a haircut until it more closely matched what I originally wanted. It came with instructions that suggested washing it first and then styling it. Even after washing it, I had a hard time styling it until I cut some layers into it. I ended up putting it in rollers so it wouldn't curl out at the bottom. That seemed to do the trick.All in all, it took some work, but it got pretty close to the look I wanted."
3,Wig was too curly.,"I expected this wig to be a straight bob, however it was very curly. I was able to staighten it a little but I am still displeased."
5,the best cd you don't have.,"a little alanis morisette, a little melisa etheridge, the band rocks, she can belt 'em out or whisper a melody to give you goose bumps. not a one-hit cd - these cuts are strong one after another."
4,First Brady Coyne novel I have read,"I enjoyed this novel-an interesting and easy read. Storyline was intriging, plot twists convincing, and character development about as deep as a book of this length can provide. I could best describe the book as Greg IIles-lite."
4,I need to read more of Tapply.,"I've only read one other in this series, so far, but really appreciate that each book stands on this own and I don't feel lost for not having read the previous books. Tapply's characters are real; human and fallible. Because Brady is not a criminal attorney, there are no courtroom scenes, which is refreshing. Instead, the characters drove the story and the focus was family and relationships. The plot was solid and definitely kept me turning the pages, his dialogue is spot-on. Although there were a couple loose threads, this was a very enjoyable read. I'm delighted there are 19 other books in the series awaiting me"
4,"As usual for Brady Coyne, not really a legal thriller","These are indeed well written crime stories, but somehow, it doesn't seem like Brady Coyne spends a lot of time working as a lawyer. And while he's not a criminal lawyer, he does get involved in weird situations.In this novel, it's strictly family as he searches for a cousin who's separated herself from the family on behalf of a dying uncle who raised her as a daughter. The story is engrossing and fast moving, but somehow doesn't reach the heights of excellance."
4,Chalk up another Dan-extravaganza!,"Thanks goodness it didn't take decades for another Steely Dan release to surface. It's always great to hear fresh music from Don & Walt. The band sounds tight, the songs are very good and the recording is super. The Last Mall, Blues Beach, Things I Miss The Most and Godwhacker are a very strong lead-off for the album. The hooks thin out a little, but the attitude continues throughout, with Pixeleen sounding like top notch Dan and ending with the intricate title tune. Great solos and a four-star effort! Not the BEST Steely Dan album - (Who can top Aja?)A VERY good Steely Dan album - and better than ANY recent release by anyone else. Everything must go is a fine addition to the Steely Dan legacy. The tour starts in July!"
3,Warming up to it quite nicely,"(This is the second time I've edited this review as my opinion about this disc has warmed up) My first impression of this latest effort was that it was a weaker version of Two Against Nature, but since hearing it several times, it's really starting to ""ripen"" and sounds much sweeter, more Steely Dan-esque with better songs than TAN. Recommended tracks include: ""The Last Mall"", ""Godwhacker"", and my personal favorite is ""Pixeleen"". I can't quite go with four stars yet but I'd definitely give it 3.5. Next time out, though, I wish the guys would reunite with original producer Gary Katz and make another album in the vein of ""Royal Scam"" or ""Pretzel Logic"". But, short of that happening, this '03 version of Steely Dan is really nice to hear coming out of my speakers."
3,Great...for elevator music lovers,"First off...I'm a big SD fan (if not the biggest). However I think that the group's latest collection of tracks failed to live up to its trademark sound of complex-yet-clever pop which blended jazz/funks rhythms with delightfully quirky lyrics. SD's music has always been somewhat of an acquired taste. As their music is generally not instantaneously accessible to everyone, it is through repeated listening that one gets to fully appreciate the distinctiveness and the engrossing nature of their music....which is my big problem with EMG. None of the tracks contain the unique qualities that separated SD's music from the rest. Gone are the jazzy and funky rhythms, replaced with what sounded to me like adult contemporary pop. Though I liked the song ""My Cousin Dupree"" from SD's previous album (I thought it nicely complemented the overall jazzy nature of the album) I feel as if EMG has been filled with 9 ""My Cousin Dupree"" tracks."
3,A general decline,"Once upon a time a Steely Dan album would contain enough hooks to throw a whole barrel load of fish at. Sadly, this is not the case with 'Everything Must Go', although I'll admit to have only listened to the album a couple of times. Generally the material isn't as harmonically rich as before and with several of the cuts having very similar grooves you get the impression that maybe the album wasn't conceived in exactly the white heat of inspiration. Also, and this is the most puzzling thing, the production values have seemed to have declined since the days of 'Aja' and 'Gaucho', with the disc sounding almost tinny at times."
3,5 stars? I am just stunned by that!,"Being a Dan Fan for many years, I looked forward to this album with anticipation. Two Against Nature, while not quite up to the old standards, was still a welcomed released. This one, on the other hand, is disappointing.Musically, it is far and away the most uninspired release of either Becker or Fagan's career. Lyrically, it's fine, but there are just so few hooks here, it's hard to tell one song from the next. I have never used ""boring"" to describe a Dan album, but this one is oh so close.Which gets me on to my main point. People throw 5 star reviews around here (and all over Amazon) with little or no regard. 5 stars is reserved for the classics: Abbey Road, Who's Next, etc. If THIS album is worth 5 stars, then those albums would get about 10. Please people, BE OBJECTIVE!This album is ok, but not up to the Steely Dan level of the past. Easily, the weakest of their long and distinguished careers. But, something has to be. 5 stars? Absolutely no way."
3,It hurts me to do this but...,"It would not be exaggerating to say that I am a Steely Dan fanatic. In fact, I am going to fly across the country (from Atlanta to Clear Lake, CA) to see them in July. I just hope they play a lot of their old stuff and not too much of their new material. I hate to say it, but ""Everything Must Go"" MUST GO (to the back of my CD case). This is the first Steely Dan album I have heard that I did not want to play over and over again. Having said all that, I will keep listening to it to see if it grows on me. Still a FANatic boys..."
3,Same ole' steely,"Steely Dan has been one of my favorites for years. when Two Against Nature come out, I was on cloud nine! The T.A.N. DVD was supurb! Unfortunately, this cd dropped alittle in creativity. It sounds alot like all the other songs from the past...(Which is not a bad thing)...But being musical geniuses that these guys are, I just expected a little more from them. All in all, a decent cd."
2,Bottom of the deck,"Of all the albums issued under the Steely Dan or Donald Fagen marques, this one is the least satisfying. None of the songs did much for me. Usually with their albums, you want to listen again and again. I'll play it again, but nothing is really beckoning me to do so.The Fagen-Becker project gained steadily in quality through the seventies, peaking with Royal Scam, Aja, Gaucho, the three singles, and Nightfly. It was evident that with Kamakiriad there was a falloff, and although 2vN was a nice comeback, if you play it back to back with the essential albums there is no comparison.This applies even more with EMG. As in 2vN, Fagen's voice does not have the power it once had, and has become a wispy semblance of its former self. The lyrics are now merely clever at best, the chord changes anonymous and repetitive.Something in there sounds like SD, but it's a faded, one-dimensional xerox of what once was."
2,Smooth Jazz Fodder,"When Steely Dan is on, they are capable of the twists in lyric, chord progression and melody line that haven't been heard since Thelonius Monk. They are not on with this release. It reminds me of GAUCHO, which had all the trappings of a band exhausted. This sounds a lot like that. Nothing grabbed me, there are no distinguishing solos, the songs are by no means memorable. And who told Fagan to sing through a sock?Skip it. This is for shopping malls, whatever bars yuppies hang out in, Smooth jazz afficianados (kind of like preferring Dairy Queen to Ben and Jerry)."
2,This is Steely Dan's worst music!!!!,"Being a fan for many years I always look forward to a new cd from the band, however after just one listen I was very dissapointed. This sounds like leftovers from Two Against Nature,the songs sound about the same and mundane. I've tried listening to it several more times, but just can't get into it.I just recently seen them in Denver,and was glad they only played a couple of songs from this cd. Mostly they dove into Aja,The Royal Scam etc... This cd will be in the dust bin."
5,Superlative Steely Dan,"A very well produced album by the Dans. Not as commercial as earlier albums, but a cool collection of tunes with some sweet Fagan and Becker vocals, harmonies and as always, robust rhythm secton driven by Carlock's solid drumming. I love it! Its only weakness, (which non Dan freaks tend to point out) is that the tracks tend have a similar bass and drum beat, which can get a little montonous. Even so, its a fresh vibrant album that is great to listen and brilliant for dinner parties etc."
2,Definitely not their best work,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Steely Dan and of Becker and Fagen individually. I have all their albums, and recently picked this one up. The album is not bad, but clearly not up to their previous efforts. I heard nothing on this album that made me want to listen to it again, unlike Two Against Nature, which played nonstop in my CD player at work for hours the day I got it. It's almost like someone else making a poor copy of a Steely Dan album, or perhaps a collection of Steely Dan studio rejects from previous recording sessions. ""Slang of Ages"" clearly shows why Fagen should handle the vocals. ""Green Book"" has a quirky, repetitious groove that is the best track on the album. Otherwise, the lyrics make for better poetry than music. Definitely at the bottom of my Steely Dan collection."
4,Steely Dan lets go!,"It's hard to believe Steely Dan actually got this album out so (relatively) quickly. However, it doesn't sound as meticulously labored as previous albums. It has a very 'live' feel to it, making Steely Dan in the studio sound like a real band for the first time since their first two albums. The songs themselves take off in style and structure from where Donald and Walter left off with Two Against Nature, but they are far more casually executed. Still, like Two Agains Nature, this album takes several listens to fully absorb. Immediate highlights for me were ""The Things I Miss The Most,"" ""Godwhacker,"" ""Slang of Ages"" (Walter on vocals!) and the title track, which is by far the best song on the album. It opens with a very ""free jazz"" feel, and segues into a classic Steely Dan groove. It will certainly be a treat to hear the Dan perform these tunes live on stage this summer."
5,Time and Steely Dan,"For my sixteenth birthday, my parents took me to the last Steely Dan concert. I have been a die-hard Steely Dan fan since I was very small. I love the new album and find it interesting, witty, and new. I think the major differences that Steely Dan fans will see in their newer work is the Jass influence, and less solo songs. Most of the older albums consist of witty solos, which were both intricate and catchy; however, their newer more laid back albums contain less of their hot solo songs. This will disappoint many initial listeners who are expecting a continuation of their older repertoire. Yet, if one is patient, you will find that the music is as slinky and twisted as ever. On the whole, I lover Everything Must Go, and recommend it to any one who is willing to listen for the heart of the music."
5,"I thougt the missed, again","Got home poped it in, shocked I thought the dynamic duo had finally missed. Played again, can't turn it off. That's the same thing that happened with Against Nature, Kamakiraid, Tracks of Whack, back and back and back. I think I finally figured why this always happens with this duo. Their music is at such a high level, you have to listen to it a couple of times to elevate yourself up to that stratosphere, I guess. That's the best I can come up with to explain this phenomena anyway. Sorry got to go, Gina and Pixeleen are waitng."
4,Hard to rate continued greatness,"It takes all the discretion I can muster to not give this one a 5 star rating. That's only because I don't think these guys can ever match ""AJA,"" the best LP of the 70s. But what a joy to buy a cd, put it on and be delighted with the music from the first note to the last. These guys are in a class by themselves and the high standards they set and always meet keep them fresh and innovative without ever losing their signature ""sound."" As far as I'm concerned, they've never made even an average album. As Lawrence Welk would say ""Thank you, boys-ah."""
2,Two Against Nature...It's NOT,"What a shame. Gone is the funk and satire. The music is good, but average and *hardly* of the level of the last record. If these guys are having fun, it is not apparent in ANY of the tracks.Don't look for any Grammy nominations this time around....Get ""Two Against Nature"" and listen to the superior recording.I can't tell you how disappointing the effort is in comparison to others."
2,Time to pack it in!,This has got to be their worst CD to date!There is not much variety in this CD.Two against Nature was much better!
1,snore....,"I've never been a big Steely Dan fan, so I was kind of disappointed when the local radio station started playing new Steely Dan songs. Of course ""new"" simply means playing the same old boring songs that sound like every other non-hit-single that this band has ever recorded. Truly great bands evolve over time, always creating new sounds and experimenting with different techniques and arrangements (The Beatles, REM, etc.). The stuff on this album sounds like it could fit on any record the band has released over the past 30 years. Maybe change some notes around and add different lyrics, but the songs are basically identical. They weren't that great then, and they're not that great now.."
1,"would give it zero if I could, yes it was that bad!","First I DESPISE with the all of my heart Steely Dan's music! I was forced to listen to this on a car trip with my dad. It sucks!!! Of all the music of my dad's collection(i.e.- Claud Bolling, Rolling Stones Los Lobos, Bonnie Rait,ect.)that I like why, Oh why did we have to listen to this peice of crap!? ALL and I mean ALL of the songs sounded the same! all the beats were the same. DON't Buy this!!! In two words: THE WORST!!! If you want something good Listen to BJORK!!!"
2,Repetition...,"This gig might serve as background music, but it will hardly become a primer record to listen to. If you have an advanced audio you may question the quality of recording - drum is lacking focus and has wash-away sound."
2,"Worst yet from Steely Dan, not worthy of the duo","A Dan fan since '72, to me this was a disappointing product. And I say ""product"" because it's not much more than elevator music, quickly turned out, with little creativity, the same quasi-disco beat in nearly every cut. It makes Kamakiriad sound like a masterpiece. Reminscient of the decline of Paul McCartney, this one. None of the wonderful, inventive jazz solos of the Steely Dan past on this CD; very little that's even slightly interesting. One has the impression it was put together in about two weeks in Fagen's basement, in preparation for their tour. $... concert tickets to hear THIS? That's insulting, Donald and Walter! Save some money on this one, dear reader--there'll be plenty at bargain basement discount prices on half.com and eBay very soon, if not already."
3,A trick for maximum enjoyment,"I stumbled across this completely by accident. I hadn't really gotten into this album very much, finding it pretty much a more generic version of their last outing on first listen. Though it's still not my favorite, I've found that the album plays much, much better if you listen to the songs in backwards order! I don't know what it is about it, but there is a much better, more natural flow to the album when played back to front. Try it and see if you don't agree. After a few listens, particularly listening this way, and I am convinced that this is an album any Steely Dan fan needs to own."
2,A poor shadow of a Steely Dan album,"If this is a ""love it or hate it"" album, count me in the hate-it camp. Steely Dan is one of my top 2 or 3 favorite groups; I began listening to their stuff 30 years ago and began playing their songs in jazz and fusion combos 25 years ago. Everything Must Go can't hold a candle to any of their earlier work. With 200+ reviews posted already, you can read plenty of longer discussions of why, so here is the short version: Almost everything about the music -- the vocal melodies, chord progressions, tempos, instrumentation -- has a deathly sameness to it, both across songs and within songs. This is either forgettable background music or, if you work _really hard_ at listening, a professionally crafted platform for still-great lyrics. I don't know why anyone with a Steely Dan collection would play this album rather than any of the earlier ones after the first few listens."
2,"Number 9, number 9...","I take away stars here not because EMG is BAD but because it says nothing new, even compared with Two Against Nature! I would have been content with a single comprised of the simple, fun, party inducing Blues Beach b/w the dark, jazz-colored Green Book. The rest is old-story all over, modern-Steely-Dan-by-numbers, some tracks even sounding like rejects from older (and I mean older) solo recording writing sessions. But Becker does play good guitar this time out, with some raunchier bite and more taste."
2,Similar Arrangements,"In my opinion, this is the weakest of Steely Dan's efforts in the last few releases. These arrangements were so similar to those in Two Against Nature, that I thought they had just put a new name to the same album. I've been a fan since the AJA album and have enjoyed most of their releases. This is not one of them."
2,sub par,"I've only listened to the new album once, but my initial impression is that it's sub-par for the Dan. Very lip-glossy and groove-slick (as were ""2 vs. Nature"" and Fagen's ""Kamakiriad""), with perfect bass licks and a beat to set your watch by. And the lyrics sound enigmatic, as usual. But it's beginning to sound generic. Nothing grabs you on the first listen (unlike 2vN, which had the title track and ""Gaslighting Abbie"" and ""Janie Runaway"" and ""What a Shame About Me"" and ""Jack of Speed,"" all of which jumped out immediately).I may change my mind in time. Right now, though, it's all starting to sound the same to me. This is a four-star album in the current musical climate, but just a two-star-jobber for Becker and Fagen, in my opinion."
2,Save you Money,"I have always said that Fagen and Becker never wrote a bad song,but I feel that this CD and DVD would have been better leftunrecorded. To me, the music seemed very much beneath the levelof creativity that has characterized their music in days gone by."
5,One of the Best!!,"From the somewhat blasphemous ""Godwhacker"" to the hilarious ""The Last Mall"" (about a pre-apocalyptic shopping spree), this album represents SD at their best (and from me, that is saying a lot). There are two songs especially that I cannot stop playing over and over again and again (both on the CD and in my mind): ""Everything Must Go"", about a failed dot-com company whose employees still have ""the sky, the moon, good food, the weather, and first-run movies"" to ease their pain; and ""Pixeleen"", about a guy with a mad crush on a cyber-heroine. SD and their music never, ever get old!"
2,Good but not the bast.,I'm a big Dan Fan but as good as this is it's not AJA. Also not much texure to the rhythm section. I was disappointed.
4,Not Bad At All,"While not as great as their ABC/MCA stuff, this album is actually full of some great tunes. ""Blues Beach"" is a strange song that grows on you if you listen to it the right way. Certainly a must have if you going to get everything they ever did, but maybe not for the lighter fans."
4,Memories of Aja,"Another classic Dan album, it grows on you with time. After a few sessions through the album to and from work, I find the album excellent. Things That I Miss The Most is my current favorite although the first and last tracks are true Steely Dan. So much of this album reminds me of Aja and their older works. Worth buying rather than downloading selected tracks!!!"
5,You don't need the DVD,"Excellent music.Pure ""Dan""; and Walter SINGS!!!Stick with the CD; you needn't bother with the DVD. It just isn't worth it; and you can see that stuff on their web site. You're really missing nothing without the DVD.Enjoy!"
5,Ooooohhhhhh,"This is good stuff. As a long (I mean REAL long) time listener of Dan, this is up there with the best of them."
2,Fagan/Becker have lost their edge,"Aja and Gaucho were such incredible masterpieces, but I was a little disappointed in ""Two Against Nature"" and even more disappointed in ""Everything Must Go"". The musicianship is superb, as always, but the tunes are weak, and the percussion, which in the ""old days"" with Steve Gadd, Jeff Porcaro, et al had lots of tasty little embellishments, the past two albums have been uninspired and ""drum machine"" like."
3,Welcome Back From Your 3 Year Hiatus ... I guess,"Steely Dan is my favorite band and they have proven themselves very much alive once again with this new album. The album is an overall feel-good mix of tunes set to a smooth blues/jazz background. What this album lacks are the emotionally charged and memorable solos that were so definitive of the Steely Dan of old. This album was also recorded live with all band components present so the ""perfect"" and polished sound of multi-layerd mixing are also obviously absent. Also, the chord changes in most of the songs lack emotional buildup so solos might be very difficult to conjure even in a live ""impromptu"" setting. The previous album: Two Against Nature was much more thorough and entertaining. I really believe that Steely Dan should regroup as many of the session artists from the classic era as they can and create a new masterpice within the next six years. This album is decent ... but I wouldn't name a tour to it ..."
4,Don't bother with the DVD,Looser in feel and freer in mood Everyhting Must Go is a superb return to form. But what were the guys thinking of when they decided to include the additional DVD option (at a price)? Don't expect concert footage or music video. All you get is Fagan and Brecker in the back of a Taxi being interviewed by the driver while a succession of young girls get in and contribute to the interview. Save money and don't bother with the DVD. But get the CD.
3,So-So,"With all the hoopla and praises heaped upon this Steely Dan CD, I was expecting another Aja, but unfortunately, I was disappointed. Although it is a return (of sorts) to the formula that made the older Dan recordings so awesome, there's just nothing there that makes we want to hear it again. Their attempt seems somewhat lack-luster, but then again, Steely Dan at their worst is better than many others best. Perhaps I should give it more time and a closer listen, but initially, I could have passed on this CD. Was probably a ""nostalgia"" buy."
2,The Future of Elevator Music,"Break out the Maalox, kick back in your wheelchair (if you can) and rock to the future of elevator music. I am crushed, crushed by how old this sounds: flat and drab, like a lounge lizard band pretending to be SD. The only SD album that gets WORSE with subsequent listening. By the time you toddle into the ""Green Room"" you feel like you're already in a nursing home. Tragic."
3,Fair,"I'd buy the CD for the Steely Dan ""sound"" alone, but there is nothing on this CD, or Two Against Nature, or Fagan's two solo efforts that are as poignant, melodic, and eloquent has half the songs they did in their heyday. No Aja, no Deacon Blues, no Doctor Wu, no Do It Again, no My Old School, No Royal Scam, and on and on. The songs are all samey, hipster-cool but still worth a listen because the sound is so distinct from anything else out today. But the Dan's best days are clearly behind them."
2,NOT a DVD-AUDIO!!!,"I bought this, thinking it was a dvd-a (dvd-audio), playable in 5.1 surround.While this album DOES come in that format, this particular Amazon product is NOT the one you want, if you're looking for DVD-AUDIO!! I already own the regular CD (great album)... what I wanted was the DVD-AUDIO.I have to return it now."
5,Better than ever?,"Having much of their older music (which I played out) it was refreshing to first come across ""Two Against Nature"". Nice, a bit Kooky perhaps but a good listen. Then a few days ago I picked up ""Everything must Go"". Some of the grooves hit the sweet spot and it seems they deliver this one with ""Panache"". Every song opens up with a catchy riff or beat or rhythm or all three put togather. Nice, very good. I want more. Thanks Steely Dan for making good music again!The improved sound quality of recordings nowdays show how talented these guys are, their attention to fine detail and ability to knit everything togather stirs something inside ( the need to move to the music). Dynamic, powerful yet subtle at the same time with lots of personality. Highly reccomended!"
5,bellissimo,"If you liked Two against Nature, don't think twice: buy EMG!!!! Even better than the previous one, on every aspect.This is one of the best SD records, up to date sounds, lyrics and the same timeless ever delivering structures and harmonies.Greetings from Italy"
2,Rock Bottom,"I've loved Steely Dan since the early days and was excited about this new release. Unfortunately, they've taken the worst qualities from Two Against Nature and stretched them out for the entire album. TAN had it's moments but suffered from a thin, dry recording mix and mechanical arrangements.It's ironic that a band known for it's high quality recordings would put out an album lacking any bottom end. The highs are crystal clear but the mix is not anchored with any depth from the bass and drums.More importantly, the material on this album lacks the edge that made old Steely Dan so great. Their classic albums always maintained a balance between jazz sophistication and raw rock energy. EMG sounds like easy listening radio music from beginning to end. None of the tunes lodge in the brain for longer than a few minutes. Very disappointing."
2,Blue Light Special,"Attention all shoppers!My daughter, who is nineteen will not sit in the car unless this album is playing. Period. She has memorized the lyrics. I have grown sick of it. Yet it is so damn good, that I can't leave it alone.Every songs very well performed, lyrically interesting and musically sophisticated. There isn't a sour note on this thing.Just about every song is about ""the end"", ""bygone days"" or ""after the fall""; yet cheerful. It's just cool. I can relate to them all. But if Fagan and Walter slurred their speech badly, you would still be left with the best performance in years. If you hate Steely Dan, you should still buy this one and pretend it's someone else or something. Otherwise, you will wind up hating yourself if you head one of these songs. They are better then chocolate."
2,Everything Must Go - except the band,"The only flaw with this album is that Dan fans tend to forget - because of lengthy timeout between albums - that Dan material does NOT provide spontaneous gratification. It requires perseverence.From the opening track, 'The Last Mall', revealing uncharacteristic Fagen animus to the final wistful 'Everything Must Go', an album well worth persevering with. Many Dan fans groaned on advance notice that Becker took lead vocal on a track ('Slang of Ages') but he carries it off well.A good album for the thinking rock fan."
2,"Quo vadis, Steely Dan?","It was bound to happen - the blandest chord progressions (for Steely Dan standards, at least) & melodies, and grooves so metronomically clinical they sound like out of a Japanese toy factory. Nothing against Walter Brecker's voice (who doesn't appreciate his old ""Lucky Henry""??) - or some toe-tapping rhythms of ""Hey Nineteen""- nature, with one or two catchy bridges or choruses (try ""Things I miss the most"") thrown in for good mesure. Yet I can't help feeling this latest rendition equals an elevator soundscape of smooth-jazz proportions which even a two-year old would appreciate in his stroller, not to mention the ""masses"" who would more commonly associate the name Steely Dan with that of a motorbike repair shop.Making your living really used to sound so much better, guys!"
4,Classic Steely Dan,"If you love Steely Dan's Last album ""Two Against Nature"", this new one will not disappoint."
4,Not Girlfriend but far from Mars,"Matthew Sweet made his indelible mark on the music world with albums that resonate with Pop, Rock, and a sense of fun. Girlfriend and the aptly titled 100% Fun are two such examples of the musical legacy he has left in his wake. Recent releases have not lived up to such lofty standards but have been decent nonetheless.Kimi Ga Suki, a fan ""Thank You"" cd for the devoted SweetHeads in Japan, is a semi-return to form. Fun, energetic, spontaneous...none of the baggage that or writing-by-numbers performances that drag down some other releases. You are not going to find songs that will define the decade for you as some of his earlier work has for me (can't hear Divine Intervention without opening a time-capsule of memories from a distant era gone by) but you will find an enjoyable listen from start to finish. Buy this album. Enjoy this album for what it is...a thank you note from a pretty cool guy."
4,long time coming,"I have disovered Matthew Sweet after years of listening to music. As a Todd Rundgren fan, I find him the extention of what Todd could have been if he had not gotten off the path of ""popular"" music. The CD is way too expensive, but the music is great. I was waiting for an American release and a cheaper price, but my need for some good music moved me to spend the big bucks. The CD sounds better every time I listen to it. My favorites are Dead Smile, I Don't Want to Know and Through Your Eyes. This CD, along with the Thorns debut, have made my musical summer. Buy it if you can, but hopefully it will become more reasonable soon."
4,"Excellent, Hooky Sweet!","The only reason that I am not giving this 5 stars is the price. I was loath to pay [the money] for an import CD, worried about the quality of the work, and leery of the lack of US-distribution.I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the production, which showcased some of the very best of Matthew's jangly style (track 10), the more somber, bass-note driven melancholia (track 7), and upbeat voice-dubbing (most others!). I am a self-professed Matthew Sweet fan, and if this does not get a US release, it is a crime.By the way, the re-acquaintance of Matthew with Richard Lloyd brings a lot of happiness. The Girlfriend-era band still sounds very, very nice.If Matthew recorded this in one week in his basement, then someone should entomb him in a studio with his band, coming forth only to produce jangly power-pop."
4,This is a glimmer of light for the faithful.,"Yes, it is terribly expensive, but I had to have it. Many of us have been disappointed in the way Matthew's career has gone in recent years, but on this cd produced for the Japanese market, he seems to be on the road to getting his songwriting chops back. This is a home recording, and even if the songs weren't really written and recorded in a week (as advertised), they do seem to have come together in a rush - a bit like a Guided By Voices cd of the previous era. Still, there are two or three things on here that are as good as anything he's done in years. The songs (mostly) seem better thought out from a lyrical standpoint than his last couple of albums. I'm sure no one will be considering buying this unless they are a big fan, so let me say that I spent money I don't have on this cd and - after listening to it -I don't regret it at all. When you hear the first track ""Dead Smile,"" along with ""I Don't Want To Know,"" I think you'll understand why."
1,Not the best,"This breaks form for me: the awarding of a single star. The sound quality here is finally that bad: it sounds as though the master tapes did not hold up at all well in the years between their recording and this remastery. I bought this as my introduction to Callas, and it only disappointed deeply. Callas had, as I have come to discover, a lovely voice...this becomes lost in this recording, though. There are both better versions of Anna Bolena, and better introductions to Callas (Opera d'Oro actually has a pretty nice Callas compilation, as does GALA)."
5,probably the most readable and reasonable book on mind-body,"Clark develops in a very clear way the main threads of contemporary mind-body research. He argues for a non-dogmatic approach to the very difficult questions that epistemology, brain research and artificial life have put in the last twenty years. His position is with those who are not trying to explain everything from a single source or with single set of tools. Not reductionism, not holism or not only emergence or cognitivism or connectionism. Still, he sees the advantages of each theory and he gives a very subtle and insightful overview of what each strand has to contribute. I have read maybe twenty books on the subject in the past few months, from Varela to Jackendorf and from Minsky to Harré, but only Clark seems to be able to make the field transparent and coherent. If he sometimes loses in boldness, he certainly wins in promise. A book that should become a compulsary reading for anyone who wants to be introduced in the field."
4,Classic fearnet,"Yes, this movie is terrible. It's a hilarious ""horror"" movie pocked full of horny teenage boys and gruesome deaths. Obviously this isn't a movie for content, but good for some laughs. Three guys move into a pad way that should be way out of their price budget. That is, except for that portal to hell in the basement... You can guess it's a silly movie, and is only compounded when the guys decide to throw a killer party. And that's where all the fun really begins..."
4,Great reception from over 60 miles!,"I live in PA, 4 miles north of the West VA border, yet I'm able to pick up 12 Pittsburgh channels - likely over 60 miles away - plus 2 Morgantown, WV PBS channels with this antenna. Took a lot of fiddling - moving the TV a few inches and moving/adjusting the antenna - to get each of those 14 channels (17 counting duplicates)without additional antenna adjustments. Initially I was using it with an '80s Fisher TV and an RCA digital to analog converter. The sound had some mild static on some channels but now that I have a digital TV, the sound is as amazing as the cable-like picture. Would give it 5 stars if not for all those initial adjustments."
3,Average performer.,"Unfortunately, product is an older version of model currently owned. In hindsight, would have checked on model year or initial year purchased. Turns out to be an average performer. No way compares to model version currently owned which was reason for second purchase. More of a good thing it turned out not to be."
2,Beware! Not for distant DTV signal,"I've actually had this antenna for several years, and for analog TV signal, this was great for getting both VHF and UHF signals, over 70 miles away! It even picked up a low-powered UHF station over 40 miles away!BUT FOR DIGITAL TV, it's a different story. I can't get a single station with this! Even a $14 non-powered flat digital antenna was able to pick up 2 stations. Apparently the digital part of this antenna isn't amplified, which means it's barely going to get more than your standard DTV (or HDTV) can get with NO antenna! This is really dumb on Philip's part--you can pick up analog channels over 70 miles away, but not digital stations 30 miles away? With analog signal now gone, this is basically only good for AM and FM radio reception.Don't waste your money--if you live in the city, get the $14 non-powered antenna. If you're out in the countryside like me, get the $35 powered indoor antenna at Wal-Mart. Skip this!"
1,Doesn't bring in HDTV stations,"It doesn't work with HDTV stations, but it works perfectly fine with analog stations, which means it will be useless after June 12, 2009!"
1,Antenna did nothing for me,"This antenna did nothing for my TV. Now I live in the desert without a real TV station with 230 miles but I am surrounded by translators. I only was able to receive one channel, and this was done by grabbing one end of the antenna with my hand. Granted that I live in a bad area, but when I can look out my windows and see the transmitting antenna's I would have thought this item would work, but, nope."
5,Pretty amazing,Outperformed my HUGE rooftop antenna. I did have to move it around a bitto find the *Sweet spot*...in the end...I put it in my living room windowand shortened the rods...laid them horizontal and got ALL HDTV stations 50 miles away ! Cable companies compress Hi Def....off the air is BEST.
3,Another antenna,"Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. When it does it works great, but when it doesn't it really upsets me. I've had less expensive antenna's work much better than this one."
2,Poor quality print,"The printing quality of this edition is disappointingly poor. The textual parts of the figures are so blurred, that literally impossible to read. Overall it looks like a poor quality scan with blurred letters and some words appearing in a strange skewed way."
3,Book for System People,"This book is good to someone who wants to think about systems. However, is not the book aim to give details about the system definition. For example, is hard to see definitions of open system, feedback, components, inputs, outputs. The reason for that is the historical moment of the book.It is a good book. Anyone who thinks about system should own this book."
2,Of historical interest,"Somewhat outdated, rehashed and self aggrandizing. More historical than cutting edge. You can do better!!"
2,I wanted to like it.,"From reading Tony's previous work i had expected something funny, clever andentertaining but it was not any of these. Perhaps he's taking a new direction into light, unfunny travelogues. If so i would recommend he not do so."
5,Fun adventure,"This is his best book yet. Finally, one of his adventures turned into a true human adventure. He actually touches on the deeper side of life - culture, friendship, love, loneliness and the importance of each to our true selves. I laughed, I teared up and I felt pure jealousy. In his former books I felt nothing more than, ""when will this book end?"" I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a story with real character yet wants to be entertained at the same time. Very enjoyable."
5,Amazing!,"First of all, I am a high school student who is extremely pro-Israel. I spend most of my free time writing to people about Israel.Ok, I picked up this book in my school library while looking for books on Israeli politics. I expected her to come into it hating Jews/Israel and coming out of it loving Israel. Boy was I wrong.What amazed me was that, despite her hating Zionists and Israelis, she went to Israel and managed to live there for an extremely long period of time.For any pro-Israel person, read this book. It really allows you to walk a mile in the other persons shoes. I had always seen Israel as a place where everything was happy and good. But, this showed me how Israel is just like any other country. Danny also amazes me, as some people say that Israel is worse then South Africa was during apartheid. Here is a South African in Israel. I LOVED THE BOOK!!! Read it if you have not already."
4,a challenging account of an individual arab-israeli relation,I was simply amazed by the courage of Sana Hasan and admired her. I would be very interested to talk to her and ask her about some details in her book that especially influenced me. E.g. the mental pressure on her while she was living on the kibbutz - sharing the room with her israeli lesbian friend. I'd be happy to discuss the book with anyone interested.
1,briliant writer who has a,i was very impressed with her ability to analises but very dissapointed to see that she have turn every thing sweet and nice to bitter and bad.
4,Good read but some of the storyline is off,No one is admitted to the hospital these days for some of the simple procedures written about in the book. Bunionectomy and most shoulder surgeries are outpatient procedures. Genetic screening certainly isn't routine and very expensive. Story was predictable but engrossing and a quick read. A large dose of potassium would certainly be fatal but hard to believe anyone could easily get away with it as potassium IV is extremely painful.Have been a R. Cook fan for many years but his earlier works were his best.
2,ear for dialog,"Here's a snippet of dialog from the African-American Warren character, who is ""a powerfully built, gifted athlete as well as the de facto leader of the local gang."" (p 91) The main character asked who might be expected to show up for a neighborhood basketball game. Warren replied:""We got rained out last night, so thewhole gang is going to show up. So getyour kicks and get that white XXX ofyours out here on the double. Otherwise,you'll be standing around holding yourXXXX. Catch my drift?""""Get your kicks""? ""On the double""? ""Catch my drift""? ""The gang""? Is this Happy Days or McHale's Navy? The Jack character answers that in the next line; ""Jack flashed back a thumbs-up."""
1,Coma minus the Jefferson Institute,This book was very predictable if you have read Coma. Nothing new. I cannot imagine how the heroes did not suspect Potassium in the deaths.What medical examiners office would not notice a pattern in so many deaths?What physician would ignore the classic signs of ectopic pregnancy?How stupid did the Hero have to be to leave the Heroine alone in a suspect murder hospital?I know people need to make these decisions so an actual story can exist but please do not insult your readers this way.Sometimes I like it when an author lets me figure out who did it way before the Hero figures it out but this time it was too predictable and 300 pages too long.
1,big disappointment,"Once upon a time, I was a HUGE fan of Cook's medical thrillers. But how thrilling can a book be when 50 pages in you can figure out every detail of who dunnit and why? The characterizations in this story are ultra-thin stereotypes as well. Formula writing doesn't work. Mr. Cook needs to take a breather and write something completely different, as have James Patterson and John Grisham. Heck...*I* could have written this book, it's so predictable!"
2,No suspense,"""Marker"" is the first Robin Cook I've ever read and I must say I was sadly disappointed. For a medical ""thriller"" this book was almost devoid of any suspense.The book is almost 500 pages long, but by page 60 I had already worked out the entire plot, except for a few minor uninteresting details.As soon as the reader is told that the main protaganist has a certain ""marker"" and you realise that young, otherwise healthy people are dying under a new healthcare programme, it doesn't take a genius to figure out the plot.I was hoping against hope that there was some sort of twist towards the end, sadly it never came.Add to that some very one-dimensional characters who take forever to spring into action, stilted dialogue and a strangely dated feel, and ""Marker"" becomes a very tedious read.And one more thing, did we have to be told about Laurie Stapledon's issues with male authority figures every 3 pages?"
2,Not up to his regular gems...,"I was really excited when I picked up this book, as I've enjoyed his books in the past, and really like medical thrillers. The sheer heft of it also didn't dissuade me, as you can read just about any length if it keeps your interest (the new Harry Potter at 600+ pages is a good example).However, I was 4 or 5 chapters into it (the Robin Cook, not Harry Potter), and kept telling myself, ""It's got to pick up"". When it didn't, I skipped to the end, hoping to entice myself into keep reading. No such luck.Maybe when I finish the book I'm currently reading & can't put down, I'll try this one again. It's just kinda unfortunate to take up time with one that's not ""stay-up-until-all-hours-of-the-night"" good when there are so many out there, including many of his previous books, that are."
2,help me I'm sinking,"Darn, it felt like it never got off the ground and predictable characters with little or no surprise. It just seemed to go on and on and on and well, I put it up. The intertwining forensic info was great-but it just seemed to go on and on and on. You can skip this one."
3,Bad dialog and horribly predictable,"I used to really enjoy reading Robin Cook's novels. That said, this novel was horribly disappointing.The characters are decently developed, but the dialog is downright laughable.The author gives away too much of the plot. There is absolutely no build-up of suspense. We know from the beginning who is killing patients, you can roughly figure out why, and the fact that Cook is setting up the main female lead to get caught up in the middle of it is something my 16 month old nephew could have figured out.Overall, the book is a fun beach read, but definitely not up to the level of Cook's first medical suspense novels."
2,Why?,Why every book he wrote has to be with a Medicare problem? Maybe RC had some problems with them and stopped practicing and started writing. But reading too many books with Medicare problems is boring. Mind that I had read all of his books.
2,Too familiar,This was a pretty slow read ~ maybe it failed to hold my attention because the essentials of the plot have already been used as a story line by other writers. There were also just too many words that did little beyond fill space...tighter writing and editing would have improved the punch.
1,Tedious and Trivial,"Complacent with the wealth engendered by his early and generally good novels, Robin Cook has contented himself with turning out some real duds. This one fits the pattern of his last dozen or so stories and is a most careless and tiresome effort. One has the impression that Dr. Cook simply started typing aimlessly and continued until an idea ocurred to him. Indeed, it takes nearly a hundred pages for something resembling a plot to emerge. However, the faint flicker of a story line is quickly extinguised by plodding prose, banal, ridiculous dialogue and largely irrelevant action which speeds along at a glacial pace culminating in a childishly predictable conclusion.This novel is not worth the effort it takes to lift it."
3,"Ok, but not great","It's ok but I knew the outcome 100 pages in. Everything was too predictable. Also, as someone pointed out, why would an insurance company risk disolution to kill someone over the fact they have increased disease risk decades later when the individual wouldn't likely have the same HMO then anyway. I just expected more plot twist and surprises from Robin Cook. I was also disappointed when NYC doctors in 2006, who earlier in the book had access to the internet, couldn't figure out the meaning of MASNP or MEF2A. Jack had to go around to hospitals to find the definitions. This seems ridiculous. The book is worth reading but not great."
2,What's the mystery?,"[CAUTION--arguably a spoiler in this review] This could have been a really enjoyable book, but instead it was maddening to me. Why would an author title the book ""Marker"" and then not expect the readers to figure out from first chapter that the mysterious deaths were because of markers?? This entirely ruined the aura of mystery to me and made the book frustrating to read. And, as if we're not already unable to put one and one together, the author also begins the very first page with a description of the fertilization of the egg of the heroine, and then drags out her ""revelation"" to herself and the readers that she...hold on to your hats...is pregnant! Who would have guessed! I don't get it. Why would the author pretend to hold out events in this book as mysteries to be solved when he tells the reader right out front what's going on?Had this not ruined the book for me, it would have gotten 4 stars."
4,A Decent Medical Murder Mystery,"I just completed listening to the unabridged version of Marker and I would give it an above average review. The book is about the rocky relationship between two medical examiners, Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton while Laurie is investigation a series of suspicious deaths occurring at a local hospital. As with many murder mysteries, the book starts slow while setting up some of the details for the plot but once you get past that, it grabs your attention. I did, however, feel that the book ended rather abruptly. The author spends a large amount of time building you up in the book and basically takes care of answering a lot of questions in the epilogue. This is my first book that I've read by the author so I'm not able to comment how this is like or dislike his other works but it had a decent and captivating storyline and I would recommend it to any murder mystery fan."
1,"Plodding prose, boring and tedious","I've read all of Robin Cook's books over the years. Each new novel gets more and more tedious and difficult to make my way through. Too much descriptive prose, not enough action. Dr. Cook has lost his way and his cutting-edge talent.I stopped reading this one after the first hundred pages. What a waste of time and effort!"
2,Just okay,"I have to say I was excited when I found this book in the library, Dr. Cook had fallen off my reading radar and this on-going series of medical examiners Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton were my favorite of the author's works.Needless to say, I was disappointed in this novel. The plot was too predictable and the characters and villians one dimensional."
3,Robin Cook on familiar ground,"This book is a improvement over Cook's two previous novels (""Shock"" and ""Seizure""), but that isn't saying much. Cook brings back two interesting characters from ""Vector"" and places them in a straightforward medical thriller plot about patients dying under mysterious circumstances. Unfortunately, Cook fans will find this premise overly familiar (it's those evil HMOs again!) and the novel is far too long. I hope Cook comes up with a truly original idea for his next novel."
2,Unrealistic dialog,I am a Robin Cook fan and own all of his books in hard cover. But this last book may turn me away for good.I agree with other reviewers that the book was way too long and it was hard to slug through it to the end. But what bothers me the most was the terrible dialog between the characters. I don't know where he lives but in my 50 years I have never heard people actually talk to each other in such an unrealistic way. I think that even Shakespeare would have thought the dialog to be pretentious and unbelievable.I'm sorry Dr. Cook but I think you need to listen to REAL people converse before you publish your next book.
1,Get this man a real editor,"This novel is...unfortunate. It's not just that it has the exact same plot as every second Robin Cook novel that precedes it. It's just that:(1) It's at least 100 pages longer than it needs to be. Arguably 200. I gave up around page 250 and skimmed the rest, encountering no surprises.(2) The dialogue is atrocious.(3) The murder weapon, which is revealed early on to be the same substance that is used to stop hearts in state-sanctioned lethal injections, would in real life have been considered immediately by any medical examiner worth her, um, salt, once she were as convinced as our heroine that things just didn't add up.Cook's concerns are socially relevant, to be sure, but he simply isn't a good enough writer to drive the point home."
4,Marker by Robin Cook,"I almost always like his books, the medical aspect of it, and this is no exception. We need more of them."
1,Very disappointing,"I remember Robin Cook from the good old days of his early novels. I have to wonder if he even wrote this book! It reads like something a 12 year old child would write; the plot is ridiculous, the characters wooden, cliches are everywhere. There is absolutely no hint of a ""medical thriller"" if you ask me. I'd stay clear of this book... I cannot stop wondering 'where is the REAL Robin Cook!?!?'"
1,Fetid tripe,"Picked up an old copy during a hurricane power failure. The power wasn't the only thing that failed. Clumsy exposition, unbelievable dialog and characters that simply do not ring true. Next blackout, I look for a deck of cards."
3,Unforgettable for Women,The perfume is not as strong as remembered. The bottles appeared so much larger in the pictures from the ad.
4,Only for Weber,I bought this product thinking it would work on on our Barbeques Galore barbeque. The clamp on the light would not tighten enough to stay put on the handle on our barbeque. I returned it. I think it would probably work well on the barbeque it was designed for.
5,Excellent Product!,"This light is simple, straight-forward, and easy to install. It lights up the grill plenty and makes cooking at night a breeze!"
3,nice til it quit working...,"...had it two years. LED is rated for 14,000 hrs. Light was well protected, grill cover always on. Was an excellent accessory until it just stopped working. Changed batteries (naturally), cleaned the contacts, nada. Debating another one as it was useful while it worked. I'm not fussing two much about getting two years out of a lighting accessory, I'd say."
2,Not very powerful,"It must get very dark at my house, this light does work but you will have a hard time seeing the color of any meat. Its not very bright so on larger grills you may need 2 or 3."
2,Buy Lot's of Batteries!!,"Agree with other reviewer(s) that this is a great light in that it manages to light the grill surface. It does that very well, but like the other reviewer, when the lid is closed the light remains ON in a very dim manner. Forgetting to turn the light to the off mode ends up running down batteries very quickly. I think that the motion switch does not entirely disengage when the lid is down causing this problem. I have tried changing positions on the handle and that has not worked. I had hoped that given a little time it would fix itself as these things sometimes do, but no luck. I will have to return it and see if another one works like it should. This is not typical of Weber quality."
4,Alternate Uses,"I was looking for a cheap, convenient light for reading in bed, and this actually worked great (if you have a headboard with tubes to attach it to)."
5,An excellent product,I found this product to be very easy to install and use and it has greatly enhanced my grilling experience after nightfall. It puts out a nice beam of light that readily enables you see how your grilling is going.
4,See what your cooking,"I like the light, it could be a little brighter but then you would probably be changing batteries all the time. It has a sensor built in that when the light is switched on, and you lower the lid it goes to a low power mode so your not wasting battery life when you don't need it. It's still hard to tell if your meat is cooked to perfection but it's much better than being in the dark."
2,Great in a way,"This light is great, only thing is that when the lid is closed it does not shut down compleatly so it keeps on draining the battery..."
4,Scientific explanaton of the start of the world,The author presents us with a history of the smartest scientists of thwe world and science breakthru's that could lead back to reasons how the world started. This book is a technical description of how the world started. There is an interesting discussion of the fact that some people believe that Gos started the world and allowed the big bang to happen and we still have to show how that God sanctioned trigger occurred.
5,Big Bang is the Big Bang!,"A book for physics-dummies in a clear and precise language. Very recommandable for all, who are interested in the adventorous search of the beginning of the universe."
5,Making The Very Complex Understandable & Exciting,"This is a very exciting book on the origin of the universe. BookTV has an author interview available on tape from January 2005. The author, Simon Singh, does a great job of making the theory of the Big Bang come alive for the general reader. For the reader who is not yet aware, the history of cosmology in the hands of a talented author makes for exciting, interesting and informative reading."
5,Spread the Word,"I doubt that I am alone in believing the reason so many U.S. public school graduates grow up hating math and science is due to the fact that the topics are typically presented as dauntingly difficult, impenetrably arcane and mind-numbingly boring. Enter Simon Singh who does what few writers are able to do in informing the math and science illiterate --i.e., make the subject matter both accessable and interesting. Had I been exposed at a younger age to the science history and theory Singh provides the reader in the Big Bang (as well as in his two other books, Fermat's Enigma and The Code Book), I am certain I would have been far less intimidated, much more inquisitive and, inevitably, better informed about the wonder and magnificence of the world and universe in which we are privileged to live. Thanks to Simon Singh, I look to the heavens with a new sense of fascination, understanding and wonder."
5,One of The Best Non Fiction Book Ever,"I have read my fair share of books and this is one the best non-fiction books ever if you ask my humble opinion. Although the title suggests the work is limited to the Big Bang theory, the fact is that the book surveys the history of physics all the way from how the size of the earth was determined to the atomic bomb to the basic working of the atom. The author does this is such compelling language and with such ease that it's hard to remember this is a physics book. The book has the best explanation of the simple theory of relativity of any work I've read. I can say without reservation that this book is the finest of its kind for the layperson."
5,Edges out Nilsson's earlier one with Bjoeling and Tebaldi,"It is exciting indeed to hear Nilsson and Corelli duel it out, each trying to hold on to high notes longer than the other. I think Corelli is the winner on that strength. Besides that, the two principles are without equals in their perspective fields. The great Wagnerian soprano and the great spinto tenor. I am not thrilled by the Liu of Vishnevskaya, her voice a shaky one. The Liu of Renata Tebaldi have always been my favorite, the conbination of tone quality and pathos. But you have to listen to the splendid singing by Corelli and Nilsson. This is, with all due respect to Sutherland/Pavorotti's Turandot, the finest on the market."
3,You Get Just the Shower,"This is kind of a non-review, since I never actually got to try the shower. This comes with just the shower head. You have to order the hose separately and the holder separately. The hose is backordered everywhere for 6+ weeks. I tried to use the head on my ShowerMassage hose just to try it, but it didn't fit on the connector. So I'm returning it without ever having tried it.While the shower head is pretty cheap, once you buy all the other pieces separately it's pretty expensive."
2,Not as expected,"I felt this product did not look anything like the image when I received it. I suppose I should have read the description better. The plate I received was glass with etchings of the design. I was expecting a black, white, and gold plate that looked similar to the image. Very disappointing."
5,Sacred Choices is helpful reading,This book is insightful reading. It will help many women who are in doubt about their moral choices on this important subject and will help them clarify the teaching of their own religion.
4,Great Contribution,"This book provides much needed information and is a great contribution in refuting the falsehoods spread by the so-called ""Christian"" Right. It is a good companion to a wonderful new book titled Real Prophecy Unveiled, by Joseph J. Adamson. Thank God for books like these, because they shed light in a world made dark by ""religious"" bigotry, hypocrisy, and aggression. They give me faith that the humble and meek shall inherit the earth after all."
1,Disappointing,"""Sacred Choices"" is written in a very readable and personable manner, which belies the almost Machiavellian way the histories, doctrines and teachings of the world's religions are interpreted by the 10 scholars in order to fit a contemporary pro-choice agenda. As a long-time student of the world's religions, I found the way this book was crafted to be very disappointing. Instead of going forward into the 21st Century with a more universal perspective that is ""beyond pro-life vs pro-choice,"" the reader is dragged back into the collective carnal mind of 20th Century feminist-ethicists and theologians. Not a great place to be."
4,"Love the taste, hate the texture!","I love this stuff. It takes a bit of practice to get it right, but I mix it with cream cheese and spread it on bagels in the morning. Yum! I don't know why it is so sticky though. You have to be careful with the lid because if you close it too tight you will have a time getting it open again. The stickiness just freezes that lid shut no matter how careful I am. I have found that running under warm water does the trick to open it again. I love my Marmite. The taste is about the same as the more expensive and famous Vegemite. Enjoy!"
2,Not up to the usual standard,"This Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James mystery was not up to the usual standard. Apparently the author Deborah Crombie found a subject, Glastonbury, which she found fascinating and around which she attempted to construct her story. However, automatic writing from a centuries-dead monk and visions of musical chants are a bit far-fetched. I will grant that the legends and myths of Glastonbury are an interesting subject, but Ms. Crombie's attempt to incorporate them into a mystery to be solved by Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James just didn't work. I hope that in her future books Ms. Crombie returns to the high quality of writing and story-telling that she has exhibited in her previous books."
2,Automatic writing?,"I feel duped. I don't mind a little magic in the books I read, but I plowed through this book to the very end hoping that the so-called communications from 11th century monks and ""Old Ones"" would be explained rationally; I was fooled. Crombie does a good job resolving the crime elements, and I appreciated the medieval history lesson, but the characters' motivation is absurd. I just can't imagine an actual Scotland Yard detective accepting automatic writing, visions, and aural hallucinations as factual."
3,Decent mystery novel,"This was my first Crombie novel and somehow I did not feel it measured up to other detective-mystery books I had read (J.D Robb, Shaun Hutson, James Patterson, etc). At times I felt this novel was dragging on and at times, it even got confusing. Yet this book had its own uniqueness dealing with Glastonbury and other mythical concepts. Perhaps to better enjoy this book one would need to know more about the monks and abbeys."
3,Not Crombie's best,"I've only started reading Deborah Crombie but I found this not not nearly as well written as Kissed A Sad Goodbye. I found the plot to be thin and the characters to be poorly developed, definitely not up to par with others I've read by Crombie.I found it ironic and funny that Crombie lives in a small town in Texas, because she concentrated her stories in London. However, I suppose the thing that irritated me most about this book is Crombie's ignorance of religions. Her book hinges on a New Age-Pagan-Goddess religious connection but she doesn't seem to understand the Goddess knows all things, sees all things. There are a lot of loose ends, again unlike some of Crombie's other better works.Not the best place to start reading Crombie, and perhaps one to skip if you're a fan and haven't already read this."
3,If you like spiritualism and supernaturalism ...,"If you like spiritualism and supernaturalism in your mysteries, then you'll love this book. In it, people today receive a series of messages from a monk who has been dead for more than 800 years. The messages are integral to the plot and are described as completely real.If you don't like spiritualism and supernaturalism with your mysteries, however, this book definitely isn't for you."
3,"OK, but not one of my favorites","Good for escapist reading, with a lot of willing suspension of disbelief, that is. For me, there was too much new-age mumbo jumbo that goes nowhere, and most of the characters were not that appealing. This was my first Deborah Crombie mystery. I may try another; however, to put this novel(as some reviewers have)in the territory of P.D. James and Barbara Vine is a good marketing ploy but a bit of a stretch."
4,Cute,"It is an entertaining love-story meets sci-fi. It has action and some extremely endowed women for guys to enjoy and surprising does have decent character development to appeal to a female audience as well. The animation quality is pretty good, but you can still see the CGI on the dragons. If that is not something that bothers you the show is worth watching."
3,Cool but still pretty average!,"Dragonaut: Part 1 is one of those anime series that presents itself with some epic action & lots of dull moments. The storyline consists of an organization developing outer space weapons in response to a growing threat from an unknown celestial entity. Tied within this storyline are two lovers attempting to prosper their love during a time of conflict between the Earth & this unknown celestial entity. The plot is somewhat interesting with epic battle scenes & cool out of this world combat powers but still has a lot of dull moments that are reserved for fan service; lots of fan service.The voice acting is pretty good in portraying the personalities of the characters. The dialogue is somewhat confusing due to the lack of details given about this unknown celestial entity & this organization's involvement with a developing weapon called ""Dragons"".I will make this anime series optional for all anime fans.Thanks."
4,not bad!,"The concept is interesting, the artwork is excellent, characters are well designed and the plot is multi-threaded...I think the one complaint is that it isn't 'up to American standards'... which I don't care if it is or NOT. The American mindset seems to be more towards the 'kill 'em all let god sort 'em out!' type of stuff.This is a study of a romance and emotional conflicts -teen-adolescent and adult. Though it seems defeatist, if one compares it with say ""Gundam- Stardust"", or ""Bakurano"" or how many other dying hero/heroine style anime, you either like it or you don't.I like it.the real downside... for the money (30 bucks plus shp...) I wouldn't buy it again..."
5,These are so funny that I belt them out at home when nobody's looking,"Whether he's enjoying his Oreo filling (The White Stuff), complaining about bad cable TV (I Can't Watch This), or commenting on the what Nirvana smells like (Smells Like Nirvana), nobody is better at turning a normal everyday song into a side-splittingly funny parody than Weird Al Yankovic."
4,my favorite Al CD,"Although it is horribly outdated (all the artists he parodies on here have moved on), this remains my favorite Al CD. His original songs on here (""When I Was Your Age"", ""Trigger Happy"", ""You Don't Love Me Anymore"") are among his funniest. And he does a good job making fun of music by Nirvana, MC Hammer, New Kids On The Block, Milli Vanilla and others (do I feel a draft?)."
5,this is great stuff!,wow! this CD is awesome. its just plain funny. nothing much needs to be says other than: BUY IT NOW!
4,Funny funny shtuff.,"A time capsule of early 90s pop culture. Weird Al's appeal for me lies in the fact that his albums not only parody the present, but years later, his songs still invoke hysterical laughter as they remind us just how silly Hammer pants :) , NKOTB, and songs like Rico Suave really were. (Look out Britney Spears and NSync, one day you too might find your place in history as just another subject of a Weird Al parody.)"
5,"Nirvana fans, get off your high horse","Nirvana is ripe for parody just as any band is, and ""Smells Like Nirvana"" is a great song (Kurt Cobain and his band loved it, did you ever hear about that?). It is absolutely hilarious, just like ""(This Song's Just) Six Words Long"" on Even Worse. Nirvana should not be placed on a pedestal, and Weird Al proves that; isn't it obvious by now that nothing is sacred for him? Not that Nirvana is the greatest band ever, but that is not a factor for my decision because I love George Harrison's music too but died laughing when I heard Al's send-up.Also, the fact that this album has ""You Don't Love Me Anymore"" elevates it almost to the level of Polka Party, which has nestled in its tracks ""Living With a Hernia"" and ""Christmas at Ground Zero."" But ""Smells Like Nirvana"" is a stroke of genius, espcially the gargling during the guitar solo and the marbles, so quit bashing Al and loosen up; it's only music."
4,A gut-buster of a CD!,"I rated it at 4 stars because that silly polka really makes you impatient to hear the other songs. All I want to say about this album is that IT IS FUNNY! Songs like ""Trigger Happy"", ""I Was Only Kidding,"" ""When I Was Your Age"" and ""You Don't Love Me Anymore"" will have you literally rollling with laughter! I especially love I WAS ONLY KIDDING and YOU DON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE, more songs about Al's pathetic love life. It would be real funny to actually see the fight during the musical of I WAS ONLY KIDDING. ""The Plumber Song"" is a catchy tune, but not real funny. I don't own this Cd personally 'cause I don't care for some the stuff on it, but YOU SHOULD KNOW it is the FUNNIEST WEIRD AL CD EVER!"
3,weird als cool but come on he making fun of nirvana,usually i like weird al but the only song i dont like on this album is smells like nirvana. nirvana is cool come on..... but it does make me feel better that kurt OK'd it and that some of the band members liked it.
1,Dont Waste your Money,This is one of the worst CD's ever an insult to the greatest band Nirvana Weird Al [lacks serious talent]
5,doug does it all (28 different instruments),This album is the best album doug has out. His version of jambalaya on the bayou is the best I have ever heard. He has his own sound. He plays 28 different intruments which is amazing and you can hear a wide range of sounds and instruments throughout the album. The duet with Hank jr. is called cajun baby and is also great. I also recommend anything by hank jr. This style of country does not compare to anything else. He is the best in concert. And the price of the c.d. is cheap so it's a must have
1,Contains aspartame,"What on earth is aspartame (a known neurotoxin) doing in a children's vitamin, not to mention hydrogenated oils and artificial flavors/colors? I bought these because I remembered them from my own childhood, but I do not recommend them. Read the ingredients!"
2,Not like other Flintstones.,"Purchased this because it was cheaper than the other variations. All the tablets turned a shade brown after opening, and they have a weird texture and very metallic taste (tate is probably normal considering these are the 'Iron' version). I'll skip these next time and get the regular version."
2,INFERIOR QUALITY,"This chain has a beautiful color. I put it on. I turned to answer the phone, the chain caught on a button on my blouse, and fell to the ground. I had had it on for less than 2 minutes. So much for the quality. This chain is very weak - not for daily wear."
2,too thin,"I didn't like this item, it's much thinner than pictured. I'm sending mine back and I think it's overpriced."
3,narrower than stated,"I bought this chain for my beautiful gold cross, the color is rich & the chain has acceptable heft, however it measures only 1mm. I'm keeping it anyway as my cross looks good with it & it does feel substantial for the width, but be aware that this chain is 1mm, not 1.5mm. That is a big difference in a small (thin) chain at today's gold prices."
4,the best black sabbath they never did,"witchfinder general are truly the ONLY band to come close to sounding like black sabbath.concentrating on the early part of their career, this album is truly balls out.not as well constructed as their subsequent ""FRIENDS OF HELL"" lp(not available on cd yet).but this one does the band fine, churning away on masterpieces as "" invisible hate""(truly the band's greatest song),""burning a sinner"" and ""death penalty"". if you are a heavy rock fan, this BAND is a must, and this cd will satisfy your need for it, until ""FRIENDS OF HELL"" is released.(please,somebody soon!!!)"
3,Their better album,This album is better than friends of hell and to me what can be understood as metal. The album has three songs I continually played for awhile the last two songs on the album are great and witchfinder general. The pictures on their albums are horrible but that should not distract you from peeking.
4,Rex Stout:Not over my dead body,"Nero Wolfe of Rex Stout can be likened to Sherlock Holmes Holmes of Conan Doyleand both have their aficionados even though the times of their actions hove movedleaving the scenarios of the crimes these detectives solved, remotely different from the contemporary society but the writing is better than in most contemporary mysteries,It is not a hasty page turner,but pleasant reading.Borys Surawicz,M.D."
2,Don't waste your money. These books are so corny.,"I expected something on the caliber of the Stepahie Plum series, but this series is a far cry. They are so corny and the characters are shallow and predictable. I bought the audio series and the reader is no Lori Petty or Debi Mazar (she spells her first name the same way I do):-)Save your money and wait until you can download this free or check it fromt he library."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"The only truly professional meditation CD I've encoutered over the years. The voice of Allen Holmquist is very pleasant and soothing. A very calming, strenghtening, reassuring, revitalizing experience. A real treasure!"
5,Loved it,Loved this book? Fast read. You will fall in live with the characters.? Nora writes with wit and makes it impossible to put her books down.
5,a good series,"Enjoyed reading this one. Have to of course start with the first one and go on from there. Nora Roberts is a excellant author, she keeps your attention to the end.The Calhouns: Catherine, Amanda and Lilah: Courting Catherine\A Man for Amanda\For the Love of Lilah"
2,Disappointing,"I read Northern Lights by Nora Roberts over the summer. Having really enjoyed it, I borrowed this book from my will be mother in law after spotting it on one of her shelves and was pretty disappointed with it. There is very little story in the 600 pages of this book and what is there isn't worth making it all the way to the end for. Roberts is a strong writer, and it's sad to see her talent wasted on a plot (if you can even go so far as to call it that) as this one. I plan to stick to Robert's non-romance novels in the future."
3,Left me hanging,"There was too many loose ends to this story at the end. New characters were introduced and not developed (Aunt Colleen, Bradford's son). Second to romantic story line was the search for the Emeralds and rennovation of The Towers into a 1st class destination hotel. We don't know what happens to either. Aunt Coco's fascinating character is not developed either. We also don't know about Caufield the thief? Does he give up his obsession?"
1,b-o-ring,"I can read a good 500 page book in 5 hours without food or sleep. For this book, it took me 3 days to read the first story. The plot is shallow, the characters were stereotyped to the point of being unbelievable. I'm still trying to read the last story of Leilah but I keep falling asleep. The book contains 3 stories and the first 2 ended abruptly. There wasn't a good flow from the characters as they appeared in the first story to the second story. Plus it leaves you very hungry for the sequel."
3,"Good but,","it was a little repetitve. Each of the three stories were somewhat similar. I did read this book within a weekend and it was pretty good. It was an enjoyable book and along with the stories about each sister meeting there man, there is a Calhoun family mystery that keeps the book interesting. Just wish the circumstances in which the sisters fell in love were unique to each. It was just to predictable!"
3,very good,"I wish more movies like this were made. It contains an engaging love story, some interesing characters, and a good deal more."
2,Not one of his best movies,"I was disappointed in this movie. I love Tom Hanks but this just didn't make an impression. It was very slow to start and the ending just left you there. I won't watch it again and in fact would sell the movie to someone else, it's not worth watching again."
1,Warm Milk,"If you love Tom Hanks, and think it's worthwhile to spend a few dollars just to watch his younger, slimmer, handsome self read lines about as intellectually challenging as the telephone book, you might enjoy this movie.However, I found it to be as lame and even more desperately devoid of a plotline than Harrison Ford's early ""Hanover Street."" But there are obvious similarities: Two soldiers, two war-torn countries, two impossible love affairs, two badly-matched significant others unworthy of the heroine, four conflicted people, one big snore."
3,Every Time We Say Goodbye,"I do not like movies with a lot of subtitles and this one has a lot. In addition, the story line is rather lacking. The typical boy meets girl and girls family does not approve. How are they going to work it out? By the end of the movie, I didn't care. However, the acting is good and it is visually beautiful. It also provides some insight into a part of the WWII that is different."
2,One of my favorite Movies,"I was overjoyed when I saw a DVD copy of this movie in Best Buy last week. I lost my copy a few years ago so now I can buy it again.This is a very romantic movie with great chemistry between Tom and Christina. I wish I could have seen her in other movies, because she's an excellent actor."
3,Just ok,I am glad I didn't buy this album at full price. I like KJ-52 and was hoping I would really like this. It is ok but kind of hard for me to get into as a KJ-52 fan.
1,For automotive work - forget it,"I'm a professional mechanic. I ""owned"" one of these about 15 years ago. Well actually it was given to me by another mechanic...turns out I was the forth mechanic in our shop to inherit this thing. The wheels are great it and over rough surfaces with ease. The problem lies in the design - the wheel wells are too big and inhibit you from raising your arms over your head. It's big, bulky and cumbersome. I was fortunate enough to pass it on to another technician...who gladly accepted it (ha ha jokes on him) I have a feeling this creeper is still being passed around the dealership as a running joke."
5,great item,this is a grat item to have it almost meet all my spectation other than been very static electricity creator it great
4,Good creeper,"I bought this creeper to use on rough concrete and packed gravel. I do have to say that it works pretty well for the terrain. The design looks kind of goofy, bit it really is as good as it gets. The tires are bigger, but you are lower slung which helps out under trailers. It gets pretty tight sliding under a truck rear end. The creeper seems good quality so far. It has a pretty big footprint compared to other creepers ive used, but it hasent proved to be a problem. I would recommend this product."
1,Restore1,Contacted the company to complain about the head and neck rest. Talked to the owner. Absolutely disgusting how he will not stand behind his product to fix the problem. Problem is the head and neck rest is molded in a 3 dimensonal logo out of some very hard product. Feels like a bunch of rocks under your head or neck. Seems company is more interested in a logo headrest instead of comfort for the customer that has to work with it. I would never ever do business with this company again..
2,misinformation,"This book said that multiple rats would fight and did not recommend getting more than one. I thought that this was a really incorrect recommendation, rats are social animals. Unless a person can spend alot of time with a rat I feel that it is cruel to only have one and there are alot of rat lovers that agree with me. I have 5 male rats at one point, they got along really well. At one point some of them did start to fight, I tried natural remedies-which can definately work in some cases-but they continued to fight so I had the trouble makers nuetured and then everyone got along great! If you have rats that fight check out rat web pages for solutions, alittle bit of bickering is to be expected."
3,It's a good starter book.,"When I first got my very first rat, this book was really helpful and informative. Then, I got a second female rat that happened to be pregnant and I found that the book didn't have as much information in it as I would have liked to have known. I would reccommend this to anyone who is just starting out with their first rat. But, if you are planning on continuing breeding or keeping rats as pets, I suggest getting something more detailed."
3,Good... but not the best.,"I've had this book for a while, and while it is helpful, it is not the best book out there on rats as pets. It's not a bad price, though, and I have never heard anyone say that anything in it is flat-out wrong, so it may not be a bad supplement to the rat library. I wouldn't use it as my sole source of information."
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK,"This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. From bad phrasing to over the top descriptions it was tedious. I couldn't even finish it, I made it to chapter four and gave up. Mr. Patterson, good luck in the future. You're gonna need it."
1,Blood runs out of this in droves...,"...and I quote the author. On one hand, I give full credit to anyone who has the gumption to sit down and write a novel. On the other hand, with spell check and grammar check on most word processing programs, there's just no excuse for the multitide of errors found in this book. On the OTHER hand, I've had a great time opening up to random pages and reading things like 'he coped a feel of a corpse.' However, I've been unable to read the book through because the errors are just too distracting. I hope that the author channels some of his energy into editing next time around."
1,So so at best...,"The first thing you need to understand is that this is an IBOOK -self published. It shows!While the IDEA is sound, it goes downhill fast. The writing is a mishmash of ideas borrowed from Romero films, Return Of The Living Dead, and oddly, the bible. The story is woven together in a reasonable way...more or less...and the author doesn't skimp on the gore or perversion (Touching on necrophilia and pedophilia in places) but gore alone doesn't save this one.I wouldn't buy this one mainly because of the godawful spelling problems and syntax errors. - They make it a painfull read. Still if you must have anything zombie this could add to a collection if only for completion. Otherwise, avoid!"
1,boring,"To expensive,boring,poorly written. Not what i expected form a man who compares himself to King."
2,"Uhm, really badly written and incomprehensible","I tried reading this book 3 times. It wasn't possible. I couldn't follow the storyline and the narration kept wandering into wierd territory. The above 'death and his army of the undead' is the kind of drivel that fills the entire book. Not good, although there were some good ideas."
3,Could have been better,"Im a huge ""dead"" fan, so when this book came along I was very intersted...The intro and 1st couple of chapters are very good and orginal..But in my opinion it just jumped around WAY too much from character to character..It seemed like there were at least 15 of them!!! Though it was cool to see how many diffrent people viewied what was going on to them, I would have rather had him build on just a few main characters...There are many spelling a grammer errors through out this book, but besides all of that, I have read it many times over...Im still waiting on parts 2 and 3 of this book!!!If you like zombie stories than you will love this book.."
2,Didn't Quite Work for Me,"This book didn't quite float my bar of soap. But there a lot of subjective reasons for that.1. I've never read Godwin's fiction, so I have no connection to her as author or a person.2. I found it difficult to relate to her lifestyle and personal problems.3. I was hoping for more writing-related tidbits, instead of Godwin's social life.The tidbits I did find were interesting and encouraging, as comisserative comparison between authors often is. But, all in all, through no fault of the author's, I just didn't find much in here that applied to me."
4,A Personal and Professional Journey,"Gail Godwin's latest book is as much about the struggle of a female in her mid-twenties to find her life's work, as it is about writing. As her story unfolds over a two-year period, the reader can sense the author's growth, both as a person and as a writer. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to be a writer."
2,Puma Turf Shoes,"I've been wearing a size 12 for almost 30 years, so I ordered a size 12, but couldn't begin to get my toes in it. I have normal feet (no wide width shoes in my closet). This shoe was incredibly cramped at the toes and loose at the heel. I boxed them back up and sent them back to Eastbay within an hour. I'm now out $26.90 for shipping (to and fro), and don't even own a pair of shoes yet."
5,Michael Manning is in his field as a shining star.,Anything Michael Manning does gets the maximum rating.His story lines and unique characters are way different from anythinjg done by anyone else!!!Amazon sent me two of this even though I had ordered Tranceptor Book One at 34plus dollars and you said you had 6 on hand when I ordered.I figured you gave my copy to a more valuble customer?
3,Hit and Miss like a whip's kiss,"The graphics are absolutely stunning, lush and highly erotic...but, as I went on to read the storyline I felt it cheapened the otherwise stimulating experience for me (read:incestuous sisters - mother w/sons kinda deal). Yes, I know it is based on fantasy and whatnot but maybe I've read one too many stories intended for adults that are looking repetitive which is why I'm pretty fed up with artists reaching for that sort of angle to make something ''darker & more taboo''. I know that depravity is the name of the game when it comes to some if not most of S&M; fiction and some readers may dig that sort of thing but as we politely say on this side of the woods, YKINMK.I LOVE the artwork of Michael Manning. The art is what sets this apart from most things you will come across when looking for deliciously crafted visuals. The storyline is the only reason why I rated this lower."
2,A Bummer from Philips,"It looked great on paper and I had become used to these cordless kettles in Europe where they are a feature in most upscale hotel rooms.Generally, I have trusted Philips appliances but this proved a disappointment. Only eight months old it crapped out and a call to the only ""nearby"" Philips office in Canada wasn't much help. I'm still waiting for a return authorization, While it worked it was fine but it's somewhat fragile and there are no trouble-shooting hints in the instruction manual.I really love the idea but will purchase from another manufacturer."
1,not worth the money,"I read all the reviews on toy guns before I bought a couple for my son and this was supposed to be a good one. The bullets get stuck and don't even come out. My little boys fingers have gotten pinched where the gun is cocked also... He still likes to play with it, but we just pretend that is shoots... could have found something alot cheaper for that..."
4,Wordy but informative,"A good insight into the mind of an inhabitant of the new world in the 1800s. Very unpolitically correct to the point of being amusing (section on 'Indians'). I read this book on a long camping tour and liked in a lot. There are some sections that are more like lists, and arenot as interesting, but you can skip over them."
5,Classic Emigrants' Guide,"This work has long been in demand by the historian and collector of overland travel to California and the Oregon country.The Time-Life Books leather bound reissue is the most elegant of the numerous recent issues from various publishers.It was indispensible for the emigrant wagon trains departing from Independence, MO, and other jumpoffs.At the time this was originally written, the Mexican-American War had just been over and the emigrants simply wanted to pass through peacefully and safely.The only real Indian trouble was rustling, stampeding, and petty thievery, but solitary travel was quite dangerous.Compare with the situation twenty years later when the Lakota Souix had become horse warriors and the threat of Indian war was quite certain. See Mountain ScoutingMountain Scouting - A Handbook For Officers And Soldiers On The Frontiersfor the later situation with open confrontation and contention for the northern plains and the Rockies."
1,Poorly made....spend your money elsewhere....,"Ok...so I purchased for Halloween and it looked great; however, once the lanterns are placed on the ""branches"", the thing is lopsided and falls over. I had to stabilize with bricks as you cannot tighten any of the posts to avoid it from tipping over. I even took the bottom cover off to try and get the thing to tighten and no luck. The little doors on the lanterns don't stay closed and the finish comes off on everything!! If it wasn't such a pain to put back in the box and too expensive to ship back, that I just trashed the whole thing. Don't waste your money!!"
5,Outstanding Look at Children's Art,"Who said children can't be artists? This book demonstrates the delightful variety of children's art around the world. But more, it is sociology, in which the art is placed in the cultural context in which it was made. How different are the artistic expressions from children across the globe. It sets the bar for future publications relating to children's art. We loved this book, as a reference, as an interesting coffee table book, as a compact study of diversity and commonality."
4,Go Boy!,"Gender-bender is back with the comeback of the summer. After a short stint at deejaying for clubheads and co-writing his London musical ""Taboo,"" the frontman of Culture Club is done with trying to rekindle the band's former success with bound-for-failure reunions, and back as a solo artist and a talent in his own right. Boy George - real name George O'Dowd - approaches heteronormity, trans-issues and childhood memories all with his distinctly witty and confessional lyrics with, surprisingly, a very acoustic ambiance to the sound of ""You Can Never B2 Straight."" The album is a definite grower, however, and some tracks stick out from the first listening like the latin-flavored ""She Was Never He""and the sorrowful ""Letter To A School Friend."" This album will probably be forgotten considering the market - but if so, it will be one of the most underrated albums of the year."
2,LOVE BOY GEORGE but NOT THIS CD !,"It's simple, I'm an avid fan of BOY GEORGE (solo) and CULTURE CLUB but unfortunately truly do not like this CD at all ~ !The production sounds muddy and the overall concept of this CD sounds tired and rushed."
1,George knows to ruin a good career,"I've been a fan of George's for 20 years now. I was 9 when it all strated. I can say I'm a hardcore fan in a way. This is actually the 1st time in 20 years that a CD by Georgina has really disappointed me. It IS NOT a new CD (only a few songs) but a plain compilation with a Gay thematic. George clearly lacks inspiration and time for his music (Nightclubbing and DJ mixing are exhausting, aren't they George ?!). It's kinda funny to hear George on 'Wrong' saying 'How did it all go so wrong, it was nothing like this on the magazines...'Well, i might have an answer : wasting time, energy and talent in DJ mixing, forgetting fans and your style ! Don't buy this CD, choose 'Cheapness and Beauty ' or 'Don't mind if I do' instead if you really want good stuff. George it's high time you put out a 'finished business' this time, take your time, concentrate on it and creativeness will be there."
3,Warm and Fuzzy,"I was disappointed with the lack of scholarly research in this book. There are only six references listed, none of which are Kano's original writings. For someone as important in the modern Olympic movement as the author depicts Kano, there must be some of Kano's work extant. The author provides a large number of quotes and conversations, several from letters Kano wrote, but does not provide sources for this. Most of the conversations seem stilted and forced. I can't say I gained much insight into Kano's philosophy and the development of Kodokan judo."
3,Fun film but definitely not restored!,"This is a fun film with a chance to see Douglas Fairbanks doing some of his famous acrobatics--in the unlikely role of a financier! I got the film mostly for the Art Deco decor and period costumes but they are hard to see properly because this film has not been remastered or restored and is full of blips and fuzziness. The story itself is a typical '30s love story. As well, unusually for a vintage film, the only other feature is the original trailer and there is no background info. If it came out in a restored clean version, I'd probably replace this one. In the meantime, I'd rather have it than not. An early Bing Crosby sings a song in a nightlife scene."
3,BAD PACKAGING,"I received the Target Precision RB-H1034 folding saw horselegs,by UPS,and they are a very strong leg system and do real well on my shooting bench. BUT!,they were packed for shipping in the worst box possible. I received the necessary brackets but that was all. The rest of the hardware had fallen out of the box throught one of the many holes that was in the box. I went to the hardware store and bought the additional hardware to put the legs together and use them. In summation I will say that : THE LEGS ARE GREAT BUT THE SHIPPING REALLY SUCKS!!!!"
4,Solid and well-built sawhorse,Great sawhorse. Easy to use after you bolt on a 2x4 (or whatever size you want). When the legs lock open it's sometimes a bit difficult to press the release to fold the legs in.
4,Mr.,"These legs were very good for my purpose. They were not perfect, but they will do well for their intended purpose."
4,Great target holder,"I bought these to make a steel plate target holder. I used a 4 foot 2x4 and hung 3 plates from it. It holds the heavy plates and takes hits from big cartridges with ease. The 34"" height allows for enough space between the 2x4 and the ground for a 12""x14"" plate to swing without rocking the entire contraption. I ordered another to make more targets."
5,Rugged Buddy,The Rugged Buddy is as sturdy as advertised. I'm using it for the supporting legs of a shooting table and I haven't been disappointed with the legs performance.
5,Sawhorse Legs,Rugged just like the name says.I will buy more Rugged Buddy Sawhorse legs.They work great for small work tables.
4,Good Product,"Purchased a pair March 2012.Not as easy (or as hard) as snapping plastic together, but well worth the effort.Very sturdy, look well made.A little pricey (70+-) per pair. Overall, pleased with the purchase.;)"
4,Great for works cited pages,"If you ever need to know how to document something properly for a paper, this book will show you and lead you by the hand."
5,"Attractive and functional TP holder, good price","I bought two of these, one for a new bath and one to replace a post-type holder in another bath that was a constant source of annoyance, as the paper kept coming off. These hold the paper in place and look pretty doing it. The price was good, too. What more could you ask?"
4,Love the easy access wipes flap,"Great diaper pouch to throw in any other bag. The magnetic wipes pocket on the outside is fantastic. Nothing to remove or open or search for, no velcro! Wipes are easy to reach one handed and do not dry out. Mine regularly holds 6 diapers, 2 wash cloths, diaper cream, lotion, disposable diaper bags, wipes and small change pad. Also has convenient wrist strap so you can grab it from your main bag for a quick change."
4,The best of both worlds,"I am a huge Mountain fan with Felix Papilardi being one of my favorite bass players of all time. Bob Dylan on the other hand, I am not a huge fan of. I think he's one of the greatest songwriters of all time, but his voice kills everything for me. Here you get some of the finest songs ever written performed by one of the loudest bands of all time. Leslie West and Corky Laing are tight. Obviously there is no Felix, but there are guest appearences by Ozzy & Warren Haynes. All in all, a very tight album. 4 stars!"
4,A Leslie West solo album?,"It took me a couple of listens, but I do like the album better than I initially did. All of the versions are pretty, good, but all of the versions aren't the ""Mountain"" sound. It really should have been put out as a Leslie West solo album.Simply put, it lacks the thunderous riffs a Mountain album is supposed to have. And there is a definate lack of Leslie's guitar solos too. Leslie is in fine voice on these songs.I like the fact that they cover a bunch of Dylan tunes I'm not familiar with.""Everything is broken"" is a great tune, and the piano version of ""times are changing"" is really tasteful. ""Rolling stone"" is great too, a very different take with Corky rapping over a drum beat.It does grow on you, and it's good to see Leslie and Corky's take on a number of Dylan classics. I hope they put a few of these in their live set."
1,Whatever happened to Mountain,"From the days of ""Long Red"", ""Mississippi Queen"", ""Never in My Life"" and classics like ""Traveling in the Dark"" to covers of Bob Dylan songs. What's going on here ? Mystic Fire was at least an attempt at something original and interesting. Looking back I think things started to unravel with the untimely death of Felix Pappalardi. I think he was a big loss both professionally and personally to the band's spirit and creativity. Although there were some real glimpses of hope in West, Bruce and Laing, it's just not the same caliber of band anymore. I have been a fan since 1969 and this latest offering is just disappointing."
3,MOUNTAIN???????,"GOOD MUSIC, BUT I CAN'T HARDLY CONSIDER THIS TO BE MOUNTAIN, KIND OF DRAGS, SORTA WEAK INTERPRETATIONS OF THESE SONGS, BUT BUY IT IF YOU LOVE LESLIE WEST-"
3,"Some Hits, Some Misses","Just the idea of a band like Mountain doing an all Bob Dylan album is pretty cool. Some adaptations work and some don't, which is probably how it should be. Buy this for the good stuff."
2,"It's All Right Ma, I'm Only Going Through The Motions",Let me start by saying that Leslie West is one of my favorite guitarists and I like his vocals. Felix Pappilardi was one of my favorite bassists. I love Mountain and I'm glad I have this CD. But if your not a big Mountain fan-this is not the first CD of theirs to buy.Leslie West and Mountain have produced alot of CD's in the last several years but precious few contain original songs. That is where they sound the best.I'm getting tired of hearing older artists make albums composed entirely of cover songs by other artists. This Cd is OK but a new Mountain album with original songs would be better.
2,So-So,"This CD is just O.K. I didn't think it was too terrific. I like the other Blues stuff he did much better. If your're a ""Die-hard"" Leslie West fan you would get a little something out of this, otherwise pass on it."
5,Great clamp - weird listing,"This is actually a clamp, as illustrated, and not ""Replacement Jaws"" as listed. They work great and the price is hard to beat."
2,Can't be written by the same author,"I've read all the other books in the series and had been eagerly awaiting this one. While it provided a nice visit with some old friends, I'm having trouble believing it was written by the same person who wrote the other books in the series. Every time someone opened his or her mouth (*especially Eve*) something popped out that was completely out of character. The case was boring and nothing flowed. What happened?!Do not judge this excellent series by this book!"
4,Roberts excels at character development,"Another great murder mystery, as has come to be expected of the ""In Death"" series. I particularly liked the way Eve connected with and empowered one of the victims.The depth of Robb's/Roberts' imagination amazes me. Even after having written so many books in this series, she still manages to develop the characters and make them compelling.It was interesting and fun to read about Eve and Roarke doing ""average"" things like visiting friends and attempting a barbecue. Those parts of the book helped to humanize those characters and to make the reader connect with them even more.Well worth reading."
4,"Good, but not one of the best in series.","I am a huge fan of the In Death series, but this one is a bit lackluster. It had some cute moments (i.e. Roarke and the grill and Peabody's detective exam); but ""cute"" is not all we have come to expect from these books. I still look forward to the next installment."
5,Another GREAT One by J.D. Robb,"I just finished reading this one and liked it very much. It is definitely a keeper. I had trouble putting it down while reading. She has come through for us again. I have read her entire series and plan to read all future books of the series. I am hoping that she gets pregnant in one of the future books. Run, don't walk to buy this one. It is a great book."
2,"Where have all the ""delicious characters ""gone?","Having read all the ""in death"" books, I waited patiently for this one. I am somewhat disappointed. It's the same old, same old, with Eve and Roarke. She confides, he helps, they argue, they make love. Peabody and McNab are well under way, thank goodness. But, where are all the other wonderful, colorful characters I have come to know from all previous books? Don't misunderstand, I LOVE Eve and Roarke, but it is time for a new twist or two in their relationship.I will say that I am in awe of N.Roberts. The talent and scope of her ability to write such an unusual series is amazing."
3,good personal relationships; bad crimesolving,"2 scenes stand out: Roarke and the grill, and the ending. It's clear that JD Robb is really getting to know her characters, but it's unfortunate that the focus on all the relationships is harming the crimesolving portion of the story. Eve just isn't kicking butt like she used to, and it makes the book unwieldy and almost painful to read. Much as I love the In Death series, I can't say it's getting better as the list of titles grow."
5,Imitation in Death Review,"Another great read in the Death series. This one definately concentrates more on Eve, Roarke and Peabody. It is always fascinating to see Eve match wits with a serial killer and come out on top with out getting too beat up and injured. The characters of our main protagonists did not develop much beyond where they were in the last book, but as always the read was easy, fun and riveting. Can't wait for the next in the series!"
4,Well done,Love it. As usual this op was pure excitement and Roaeke (my man) always brilliant and so sexy. The master mine of JD Robb did it again.
3,Imiation In Death,"I enjoyed listening to it while I could, but cassette #5 was not recorded correctly, so I couldn't listen to the period of time that this cassette covered."
2,Eve Dallas vs. A Dead Giveaway,"This book is the weakest book in the In Death series, for a number of reasons. Much like my ex-girlfriend, its just no good. The plot is slow, with the biggest avenu for the investigation being, are you read, PAPER SALES! Thats right, Eve, roarke, Peabody, and the rest, go all over the world to ask people about paper! Then, the killer is a dead giveaway. If the killer was anybody other then who they were, the cover makes no sense. But, it did have a few good moments, such as Eve's new memories, and Peabody making detecive."
3,"Good, but not the best in the series","J. D. Robb's '""In Death"" series, featuring Lieutenant Eve Dallas, is a great detective series. Because Robb (aka the best-selling Nora Roberts) is best known for writing romance stories, many detective fiction fans have overlooked these books. They shouldn't.That said, ""Imitation in Death"" is missing one key feature in my opinion, and that's tension. As always, Robb/Roberts has painted the future with great skill, and it's rewarding to visit again the returning characters. But in the best of the series, for example ""Conspiracy in Death"" and ""Portrait in Death"", there's conflict to be solved among the protagonists as well as conflict with the criminals. In this book, everything just feels a bit too smooth."
4,could have been better,"The 'In death' series, is my all time favorite book series. I loved every one of them. The story, the characters, the mystery. But, Imitation would probably be my least favorite of the series. Though the murder was well written, I had hoped for more interaction with the characters I'd come to know so well. No Leonardo, no Charles, very little Nadine. What about Trueheart, Baxter. I missed all of them. This doesn't mean I didn't like the book; I did. But I was a little disapointed."
5,A five-star author,"For my money, all of J. D. Robb's mysteries rate five stars. She's always consistent in character development & suspense."
5,Imitation in Death,"As usual JD Robb did not disappoint.The book was excellent.So far she has never let her readers down. The romance between Eve Dallas and Roarke is sexy and sweet.They make a breathtaking couple.The intriguing murders and how Eve and Roarke end up solving them together in spite of having very different opinions on the law,makes for a fascinating read.I buy every book Nora Roberts writes and have every book published in the IN DEATH SERIES and pre-ordered the new ones coming out soon."
3,Dead Giveaway,"All right, I've said it before, but I'm sure I'll say it again and again: This series is my guilty pleasure. The characters are great, and if you've read this far in the series (the books should be read in order) you're either hooked or masochistic. I can't decide what that says about me. Being a mystery buff, I'm dismayed at the lack of actual ""mystery"" in these books. Usually, the title gives you the 'whodunit'; maybe Ms. Robb doesn't want to cause her readers any anxiety by making them wait for Dallas to solve the crime. In the case of this book, the answer wasn't in the title, but rather in something equally as obvious. But I'm still reading them because I love the characters and their interaction. No one plays a minor role in these stories, which is in itself an accomplishment. Yep, definitely my guilty pleasure."
4,"A very nice looking product, and grabs my knives with gusto!","I purchased and installed this item in my kitchen to keep my knives out of the reach of my 4 year old and out of my drawers, where they can be dulled (not to mention cut my finger off if I'm not paying attention). It looks great, and was easy to install (provided you have a power drill, which every household should have!)My only complaint is that the anchors included did not work for drywall, which I'm guessing is what most kitchen walls are comprised of. I used some higher quality metal anchors, and it is rock solid even though I didn't put it in a stud."
5,Magnetic Knife Bar,Fabulous Product. How easy to have all my knives right in view and in order! I think it will be better for the blades too.. not knocking around in a drawer or constantly sliding in and out of wooden holder.MIU Stainless-Steel 15-Inch Magnetic Knife Storage Bar
5,MIU Magnetic Knife Hold,"Great Value? Built like a battleship,it's sure to last several lifetimes. This magnetic knife holder easily holds 15 knifes, including Wusthof's very heavy 12"" Chef's knife and their 14"" slicing knife. One screw hole cover was missing from the shipment. Not certain of the steps I'll have to follow to obtain the missing part from Amazon."
2,Not up to parr!,"The MIU France Stainless Steel Magnetic Knife Holder does not have the magnetic hold that I have used before. The strip has a varying magnetic hold and the knives have to be placed in specific spots or it will not hold the knife and it will drop, possibly damaging the knife or counter. Check out another product if you are looking for a magnetic knife holder."
3,Great with one exception...,"I bought this item for my set of knives after reading the reviews of this. The strength of the product was the actual strength of the magnet, i.e. the magnet was strong enough to hold all of the knives. I have found this to be true for all of my knives except one. I have an 8 inch chef's knife that will only stick on one side. If I try to attach the knife on the other side, it slides off. I'm not sure if this is a knife issue or a bar issue. I just know it's annoying.So take my 3 star rating with a grain of salt I guess."
2,magnetic knife holder.,magnet in bar does not have adequet strength to hold knives sescurely. They tend to slide.
3,This magnet is so...wait for it!...wait for it!...ATTRACTIVE!,"LOL! Sometimes I just kill myself!The magnet is strong and the stylishly wrapped in stainless steel. It is easy to mount -- a screw at each end -- and holds just about anything you want it to. Mine currently holds full sets of both metric and SAE sockets. Sure it was meant to hold kitchen blades, but to each his own, eh?Three stars: it does what it's supposed to. Nothing particularly exceptional, but nothing bad about it, either."
1,TERRIBLE - MISSING PIECES AND NO RETURNS ALLOWED,I got screwed by Amazon and this french company. we got the knife holder nd went on a work trip. When I came back I found out some parts were missing. NO WAY TO CONTACT AMAZON OR MIU!!!! And my woindow of returns is gone. AMAZON's a-z policy is not really that at all.Now I have wasted money and still no knife holder.MIU France 15-Inch Stainless Steel Magnetic Knife HolderTERRIBLE EXPERIENCETERRIBLE PRODUCTJUST PLAIN TERRIBLE
4,Mounting could be better,"My knives are highly attracted to the strong magnets in this holder. Carrie would have had to exert some extra psycho-kinetic energy to quickly do in her mother, had the latter kept her knifewarez on the MIU.The only improvement I might add would be mounting holes 16"" on center to avoid having to use some type of anchor."
4,Weak Spots,"It's definitely got stronger spots and weaker spots running across it. So make sure you know where NOT to put the heavier knives and you'll be a-ok. Still overall stronger than any knife holder I've had in the past, for sure."
2,Poor mount and potential to damage knives,"Sure, it looks reasonably nice, but it doesn't seem like it's very well designed. The edge that the knives rest on is metal and rough enough that I suspect it will have the potential to damage knives over time. Also, the mounting screws are in the center of the rack so the whole rack tends to rock slightly as you pull knives off of it."
2,Just OK,"I bought this because I have a really small kitchen and the knife block that I had was taking up wayyy too much valuable real estate on the counter top. That said, I chose this one because it got rave reviews. I disagree. I could have spent less and gotten the same result. It looks ok except for the huge dent on one side. The packaging it came in tells me it was either damaged in the warehouse or in transit (although it was packed pretty well in Amazon's box). It DOES NOT COME WITH THE MOUNTING HARDWARE as stated. It's a good thing hubby is handy. It seems to hold my knives pretty well, they slide down a little....Overall it's fair to say that I am kind of disappointed in this thing. You can get a product that will do the job just as well for less."
4,Nice look - Strong enough magnet,"Product showed up and had a small scratch, at first I was upset but then realized that a knife blade would be covering it most of the time anyway. Price on this was reasonable compared to some of the other stylish and stainless units on the market"
5,"Great buy, easy to install, strong magnet!","After surfing through the Amazon.com reviews, I decided to buy one. It's the perfect length. It was easy to install. The anchors that came with the product was strong enough to hold the strip securely on my sheetrock wall. It's strong enough to hold my cleaver, scissors and the rest of my standard knife set in a horizontal configuration. I've read that most other knife strips can only hold knives in a veritical configuration. I love this product! It cleared up so much kitchen counter space for preparing food and it looks organized and great. Worth the price!"
5,"Perfect size, no slipping",A reasonable price for a quality product. My heaviest knife is 10oz and I don't have any slipping or sliding. Looks very attractive as well.
4,Great tool for my tools,This is a great magnet knife holder. The magnet is strong and holds many knives at once. I wish I would have bought 2.
4,"Looks amazing in my kitchen, holds knives in place !",It looks really pro holding my chef knives on the wall.It is secure and magnet is strong. It also prolonges the life of knives as they don't rub againist each other in drawer ! I love it !
3,An obvious return,"The box was obviously opened before. The inside styrofoam was broken. There were no hanging directions which this product needed. There were a few, minor scratches on the finish but I figured that it would have that the first time I hung some knives on it. It is a strong magnet and works well."
5,"Excellent, Affordable Knife Holder","I was a bit leery buying this item after reading some reviews of the varying magnet strength. Either I got lucky, or those reviews are not accurate. Either way, I love this knife holder. It easily holds 7-8 knives, including a cleaver. I find the magnet strength perfect; not too strong where I fear I will yank the whole holder out of the wall when removing a knife, but plenty strong where I don't fear knives will fly off if there was a shaking disturbance or if someone bumps a knife. I also did not have any issues with the mounting hardware supplied, but perhaps that is because I mounted it on a hard ceramic tile back splash, so it was very secure with the anchor provided. (Hint, if you are mounting on ceramic tile, you can snip off the wide, open end of the anchor. If you don't, you will struggle fitting it in the 1/4"" pilot hole you drilled for the anchor.) Overall I couldn't be happier with this product."
4,Quite heavy,Its quite heavy for magnets. Was hoping to use velcro to put this up but will require some drilling into your studs on the wall. Seen my friends use it at their house and it looks great. Just be wary that you should invest in some knife covers so you dont accidentally cut yourself while trying to grab the knife off the magnet.
2,"Poor workmanship, bad functional design","I purchased two of the 15"" blocks in November 2012. Both were returned.Finish quality problems: Both blocks exhibit discoloration on the outer stainless steel rim at the welds. The edges of both knife blocks are roughly hand ground to smooth the welds and vary ~1/16"" in thickness. The flat polished stainless face of one of the blocks was marred with dimples and scratches, the other was ok. From across the room these look fine, if you look at them from 3' you will immediately notice the flaws in workmanship.Functionality: The magnets were VERY strong. You have to 'roll' the knifes off the block. The edges that contact your knives are brushed stainless and tend to scratch your knives if you make the mistake of sliding the knife as you take it off."
5,Outstanding product,"This is such a functional way to keep your knives and scissors readily available. We put ours on our cream backsplash, and it looks so nice and organized with all our favorite black handled knives standing at the ready. The magnet is very powerfull and the design is perfect for our space."
3,"Arrived cracked, but is a pretty good knife rack.","We like the knife rack, but it isn't very well made. Ours arrived with a small crack in it. We didn't feel like going to the trouble of sending it back, so we just keep a knife over the the spot that's cracked. The rack does look pretty cool hanging up in the kitchen, and the magnet is strong."
4,Attractive and functional!,"A great space saver and looks nice too. As usual, a good deal on Amazon and will compliment any kitchen. We love it!!"
4,Nice and strong,Nice works great. Strong maybe a little too strong I feel like I can hardly get a knife off of it. LOL maybe it will wear down over time?
5,I'll never go back!,"For years I kept knives in a drawer because I don't like how knife blocks can breed germs in the slots. However, I've gotten more than one cut reaching in to get one. After watching yet another celebrity chef extol the merits of a magnet, I gave in and ordered this one. I LOVE IT! It keeps the knives out of the way, but still convenient. It's safer, cleaner, and looks great in my kitchen. This magnet is very strong, holding 8 knives and my honing steel. It even held my cleaver! It was easy to mount, and is easy to clean.Overall, this is worth every penny I spent on it, and I would not hesitate to order another if this one ever failed (3 years and counting!). Highly recommended!"
4,Nice and heavy,"This is what I was looking for. No more space hogging knife blocks on the counter! Easy to install, strong magnet. Great size for about 5 knives, scissors and a steel. The only issue is that the plastic blocks that are supposed to hide the screws at either end do not seem to be made of good quality plastic. It is only a minor quibble, though, in an otherwise well designed, reasonably priced block. I would buy one again."
2,"Strong magnet, weak frame.","As others have mentioned, the magnet in this holder is incredibly strong and would (I imagine) provide years of service; however, the frame and mounting hardware are not of a corresponding quality. I attempted to install this using the provided drywall screws and had just decided to find alternate (better) hardware when I accidentally knocked the bar from a shelf to the counter--a distance of less than a foot. That short fall damaged the bar beyond repair. The front grid bent in several places and due to the extremely soft nature of the material, I was unable to reshape it adequately enough to refit it to the bar. Based on the other reviews and the quality of the magnet, I'd guess this is a great piece that performs as expected...just treat it very, very carefully when installing and definitely avoid the included mounting hardware."
2,Too heavy,"I suppose I should have checked this information before purchasing the item, but once I got it, I realized just how heavy it is - too heavy to install in my apartment. The magnets are fairly powerful, though."
3,great but....,"This works well, but I found one cheaper at IKEA for about 9 bucks. That's the only reason I gave it 3 stars."
1,knife magnet,it was just what I wanted but it would be nice if you included directions telling someone the ends pop off for mounting
4,"Great magnet, BUT the screws to put in wall!!!!",I'm very impressed with this magnet to hold the knives but their were no instructions to put this on the wall and I'm pretty good with drills and a hammer but after I got the screws in the wall they are not even close to what you need to attach this to the wall. They are not what should even be with this item. So once you get this item be prepared to take it to the store to get the right screws to attach it to the wall.
2,not the best,"I really like this product but the bad thing is that it has a magnet gap right in the middle and therefore it is not safe to put knifes there. the 15' holder has the weakness at the ends. but i need one so i am keeping the 15' one. someone else suggested getting the one from IKEA, i will look into it. i returned this product."
3,Works well except for bare spots with no real magnetic power,Looks as pictured on-line. Easy to install and comes with drywall inserts which allow it to hold up to the weight of a bunch of knives. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the poor magnetic power at the ends and one spot close to the middle. Odd but annoying! A number of people complained about this and they are right!
5,"Easy to install, works great","MIU France 15-Inch Stainless Steel Magnetic Knife Holder is easy to install, looks very nice, and works great. magnet is plenty strong, yet it's easy to get knife off with a simple twist. also good for scissors and other utensils. good quality."
5,Awesome!!!,Most certainly the best invention ever. No more knife block sitting on your counter space. Straight to the point I would buy this time and time again.
3,"Strong Magnet, Poor Finish","It holds a lot of knives very well, and would be perfect if it had not arrived with a scratched finish on the front. I should have returned it, but it was for a friend who didn't want to wait. If it had been me, I would not have settled for it because it was quite noticeable even from ten feet away. If not for that major cosmetic flaw, it would have been excellent. This should never have been boxed up by the manufacturer."
5,Love it!,"I love this knife bar. I've worked in restaurants for years and something like this was always back on the prep line for all of the various knives. I really wanted something like it for my apartment since I have a very small kitchen. Lo and behold I found this on Amazon and it's perfect. I now have extra space on my counter since I don't have to use that huge knife block and its also opened up a drawer that I had kept my random knives in (also preventing the knives from dulling in the drawer from hitting the sides, each other, etc.) The 15 in is the perfect size for a smaller space (I debated between this one and the bigger one). In fact, I think I may even order another strip to hold more knives. Perfect."
4,Great product,The only thing I would change about this product is the mounting hardware. The attachment to the wall is a little loose for my liking.
2,"Weak magnet throughout the whole 20""","This magnetic knife holder holds all of my knives, but as the other reviews have said, it doesn't hold them well. The magnet is recessed in the holder itself so that only the edges touch the knife. The middle of the magnet is stronger than the sides, so I have found that I have to place my chef knives in the middle and my pairing knives on the side, handles up of course to help provide them from slipping off..I am not impressed at all. I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to hang the magnetic holder so that I could return it for a better option. This will be coming down out of the kitchen and going into the bar to hold a pairing knife and bottle opener. I can not imagine having a $400 knife slip off the magnet..I don't trust this magnetic holder."
2,Possibly defective but not getting another,"I read the reviews so I was expecting a solid product. Instead, I may have simply gotten a defective unit but I am not ordering another as a replacement to find out. The highly reflective metallic front doesn't show in the stock photo but does show in customer photos and mine was slightly warped. Be careful, the face by be easily scratched by metal.The biggest issue was that knives did not hold with the same force along the entire magnet. I got stronger holds toward the middle while there was an area on the left half that actually repulsed the knife (I don't know know how this is assembled, it's almost like two of the same magnet ends (North or South) were put together in that area). Removing and replacing them made the other 5 knives slip just a little bit each time. I bought the Chicago Cutlery ones a couple of years ago and will stick with that. If anyone had any idea what was wrong with the knife bar, please add! Thanks!"
3,Nice but magnet could be stronger,A magnetic knife holder like this one is a great way to protect your knifes from getting banged around in a drawer. This one holds all of my knives very well except for my heavier Victorinox/Forschner serrated knife. It tends to slide onto the floor if I don't place it onto the magnetic strip just so. That could be dangerous if you have kids or pets.
3,Buy a different brand,"I carefully read numerous Amazon reviews on several magnetic knife holders before purchasing this one. The holder came in a sturdy cardboard box and rested between two pieces of styrofoam. Despite this, there was a 3/4"" long, 1/4"" high scuff on the face, approximately 4"" from one end of the holder. I wasn't happy about it, but figured I could live with it. However, once the holder was affixed to my wall (using toggle bolts as the screws and anchors were NOT going to have a long lifespan), I discovered that the magnet is far weaker on that same end of the holder. Sadly I had missed the comments of at least 2 reviewers who noted this problem. Since I probably should have tested the strength before the holder was installed but didn't, I am keeping it, but I cannot recommend it to anyone else."
5,"convienent, quality space saver","MIU Stainless-Steel 15-Inch Magnetic Knife Storage BarFinally own my space so can do wall installations and found this knive bar which has been on my wish list for years. No longer rummaging thru drawers looking for the right knife as they all are in front of me in easily accessible wall space. Was easy to install, holds all my knives and frees up the counter space a knife block would take. Is strong and sturdy so I have no worry about it falling.Like so well I have bought another for my son-in-law who is always frustrated trying to find the particular kife he wants to use and has very limited counter space.Would definitely recommend."
5,Magnetic Knife Rack is great!,"It looks exactly as it was shown in the online photo, nice and sleek, and quite strong. Very nice."
1,Not impressed,"The item I received was clearly used. The box was not sealed (the item box, not the shipping box) and the Styrofoam was damaged. The reflective face was dented in several places and was warped on one end. One side of the holder was nicked/pitted and looked like knives had already been used, at least several times.Aside from the fact that it looks used, I am also not pleased with the product itself. Within the gaps between the reflective face and the edge I can see what looks like adhesive sticking out. The reflective finish shows fingerprints with the lightest touch. The bar should mount using 4 screws instead of just two on either side in the middle.I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews, but I am certainly not satisfied."
4,Only one complaint,"My only complaint with this product is there is no rubber rim around the magnet.There is a raised lip around the border, and if this were rubberized, it would get 10 stars.I feel like the metal on metal (while providing a nice satisfying sound and feel) is not good for my knives, and degrades over time."
5,Functional and useful answer to my knife problems,"I searched for some time for the ""right"" knife holder, one that would not take much space, but that would hold every knife I use regularly. This compact unit does the job beautifully. The magnets are strong, and hold even the knives with the thinnest blades easily, and was easy to attach to the wall. 14"" of the 15"" is usable, though I do wish they had incorporated some way to store my knife sharpening steel as well, but a heavy duty cup hook took care of that.I have nine knives on the bar, ranging from the thinnest paring knife to the sturdiest chef's knife and can easily remove and replace them with ease, and nothing ever slips or slides. Well done!"
3,Poor construction? Defective?,"The knife holder is essentially two pieces stuck together, a magnet and a steel frame where the magnet is seated. The magnet piece I received is bent so that the magnet is not flush with the steel frame in certain areas, namely the far left side of the knife holder. My 8"" chef knife will not stick when placed there. The ""dead spot"" for my 8"" knife is about the width of the blade, so long as I place it right of that it sticks fine.This issue is not a big enough annoyance for me to return it but I was surprised no one else had mentioned this in reviews. I guess I wasn't one of the lucky ones.I posted a image of my knife holder in the gallery, should give you a better idea of what I'm talking about."
4,very secure yet items easily removed,"Strong enough to hold my 10-inch cast iron skillet without sliding but can easily be removed by mastering a twisting motion that doesn't require great strength - by far the best I've seen. I know, it's for knives, but I want you to know how strong it is, and yes, these racks are great for keeping other tools handy. The downside, however, is that it itself weighs nearly 4 pounds and needs to be solidly mounted - my husband says the best is to the studs rather than just the wallboard. The complaint is that the mounting brackets are spaced at a non-standard 19 inches. My other complaint is that I was expecting a 24-inch magnetic strip. In reality, the magnetic part is closer to 18 1/2 than 19 inches and the overall length is 20 inches. Also, the attractive stainless steel shows fingerprints and scratch marks, so be realistic about your own expectations. I've tested other racks that are strong enough to securely hold knives, but don't have these problems."
4,Excellent Product!! Poor Hardware.,"This product works great, looks great and is a great price! Keeps my knives dry and handy while saving tons of counter-space!The only qualms I had were with the screw anchors they give you in the package. They are a piece of poo--they bent the instant I tried to hammer them into the wall. Do yourself a favor and just get some heavy duty plastic anchors from the hardware store and don't even mess with the ones they give you.This product would get a 5 if they didn't skimp so badly on the hardware!"
2,Beware of scratches!,"I purchased this magnetic knife holder to use with my newKai Pure Komachi 2 8-Piece Knife Set. I had gingerly placed the knives on while it was on my counter and when I took them off, most had grey scratches on the colored blades. The part that comes in contact with the knives is very thin, and not at all smooth metal. Will be returning it and purchasing one that doesn't ugly up my knives. I gave it two stars instead of just one because it does really hold them well, not necessary for me since all mine are light but if you have heavy knives they will not fall off the wall with this."
4,Throw away your knife block,My sister suggested I try a magnetic bar for my knives. I bought this one and wonder why it took me all these years to do it! I can put a whole knife collection on the bar (I have 3 chefs knives and a about 8 other assorted knives.) I also keep my kitchen scissors on the bar. It is off the counter and out of the way. I think this is a great way to store your knives. My knife block is going to the thrift store. I gave it only 4 stars because I have had it only a few months and I do not know how it will last.
4,Just one thing missing to be a 5*,"It is a strong, easy to mount and attractive piece of kitchen wear.I own Japanese knives, some with intricate damascus work and decided not to put metal on metal so use this to hold my steel measuring cups/spoons.I mounted it vertically on the side of a cabinet at head height and it works a treat.If it has some kind of coating/layer on the metal it would have been perfect for my knives. It would certainly be fine for knives that you don't mind treating roughly (Henckel/Wusthof/etc)."
3,Decent but overpriced,"This item is decent and looks good. However, while I was shopping in IKEA, I saw another that is not as good looking as this one but does its job good. It has decent look and is much cheaper, $9.50. I will go for the IKEA one if I need another in the future."
1,Horrible,"This came with no directions, and while most people could hang this without thinking, it was a bit confusing. It is very heavy as well, and looks rather cheap."
3,Incomplete accessories,"As with the above reviewer, my son had been looking forward to receiving this guitar for a while. His excitement turned into complete disappointment when upon connecting the amp to the guitar, smoke started to come out of the amp jack and we got an awful, burnt smell! I first connected a 9V adapter which the instructions said we needed, but was not included, then a 9V battery which got so hot that I had to remove it!Luckily we were able to connect the guitar to a portable karaoke machine, so that satisfied him. The amp is no good, but the guitar is really nice looking."
1,Weak guitar but only for beginners,ok for a few lessons but will need to upgrade very shortly if there is serious interest. I would not recommend.
3,Think Dirty with Marty Feldman: not bad,"Not a bad movie if you're interested in Marty Feldman's take on mid-70's British advertising culture, complete with an ugly American ad exec and lots of hedonism."
1,Dont waste your money!!,"In this case, the old saying is true: ""You get what you pay for."" These boots were of poor quality and HURT my feet. I ended up tossing them and buying a pair of Ariats, which are very comfortable and will probably last forever."
1,Bottle won't stop dripping/leaking.,Even after following the instructions completely (filling the entire bottle and allowing for the water to drip out until a vacuum forms) the bottle still drips and leaks. It wouldn't stop dripping from the steel spout and it wouldn't stop leaking from the blue screw cap even though it was securly fastened.I went to the pet store and bought a gerbal water bottle for $5 and it works perfectly.
1,Useless!,"You cannot program this monitor with your age, weight. etc. so it has little function except to tell you to ""Increase your workout."" It cannot be returned without its original packaging--that nasty plastic that you have to shred to open it in the first of money."
3,Not sure if its ok or not.,"The crickets don't seem to starve, but I don't have them around long enough for them to starve either. It seems like a gel of water."
1,Smell Awful,Do not buy this product. It has a very strong musty smell that you cannot get out. I had to throw it out. It is a waste of your money.
3,Same Problem as Others,"I bought this as a gift, and had considered getting one for myself as well. I also found mold inside the first box shipped. Get Organized sent me another quickly and at no charge, but I wouldn't risk buying another one."
1,Avoid! Mold!,The first box I received had mold in it and smelled bad. The seller quickly sent a second box. It was even worse. Seller told me they had no way to check condition before shipping. They refunded the cost. I was sorry there was no way to work this out because the box would be very nice if it weren't for the mold.
1,Ring Box,"The ring box had a very foul smell to it for which it did not go away. I aired it out for weeks in our three season room which it was exposed to no heat, etc. just cold air and the smell did not go away. I was very dissatisfied."
5,Just what I wanted,This is perfect for holding your rings. I used to have to open individual boxes to find what I was looking for. It is well made and just fun to have.
3,Just OK,I ordered this ring box based on what I saw in the picture.You should know that the lid DOES NOT stay open by itself as shown in the picture. The lid is attached to the box with a piece of ribbon. I find this small complaint to be a hassle. The construction materials are OK.. sorta deceptive on the lid though.
4,GREAT customer service,"The item in itself was constructed solidly and is very attractive, it is also a good size. I was slightly disappointed in the color I received as it was not was what had been pictured, but was acceptable. Upon contacting customer assistance I treated graciously and very fairly. The customer service of this company is outstanding and very rare these days. They responeded quickly to e-mails and worked to make a happy customer. To be sure I will be recommending this company to all my friends and family. I'm sure the recipiant of this gift will be will be as pleased with it as I am with this company."
5,Great CD Hickory Cajun Hillbilly - Al Terry,"All the songs are great. Any one who loves Country and Western, music, will enjoy this CD. All the titles are up beat tempo..."
3,Easy Country,"Al Terry was to 50s Country what Jim Reeves was to 60s. If you like the easy laid-back approach, this might be for you."
4,Great !!!!!!!!!!,Great songs on here some of them are better than othiers. alot hard beating than the very release before. Like Regime Chage and Dive as well as Game On. Which disciple displays great rock songs on here.
4,Quality chain for the money,"I purchased this chain for my mother as a birthday present. She is quite the jewelry connoisseur, and she was very pleased. I feel the chain was reasonably priced yet still a quality piece. The thickness of the chain gave it enough ""oomph"" to stand out yet remain understated at the same time. The lobster claw clasp was very secure and seemed well-made. I plan on asking for this same chain for Christmas from my husband!"
5,pleased as punch,The John Deere book I ordered arrived in excellent condition and was shipped very quickly. I will purchase from this seller again!
2,Good for beginners,"The book lacks depth. It good for beginners as a starting point, that it. Does it explain the problem, yes. Does it tell for what to do step by step, No. Does it even give you a template or a blueprint of what to do, No not in any depth. The year 2000 problem is complicated but achievable. The way to tackle the problem is from a process point of view, because that is all it is, a process problem. The programmers did not cause the problem the real culprits where the ANSI and the FIP but you always here people blame the programmers. (no I am not a programmer) The book needed to be more hands on, teach and explain the process of how to fix the bug, in this way everyone reading will get something out of the book housewife, programmers, and CEO's.Bottom line I could have done a better job no offensive just the facts as I see them."
3,"Great story line, awful grammar and editing","I was intrigued by the story line of two brothers in their 20's taking a small sailboat down the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers and into the Gulf of Mexico, culminating the journey in the Florida Keys. The author makes up for lack of polish with enough insight and humor to keep the reader turning the pages, entranced. A boat trip often strains relationships. He explained the methods they used to cope with trip and relationship challenges while weaving in a story about their Uncle Billy's depression and drinking problem. Their adventures were chronicled in a journal-like fashion, with interspersed reflections on the past, making for an enjoyable read. But the lapses in grammar were obvious, frequent, and distracting. This book makes a good case for the importance of input from a good editor prior to publication."
4,Very cost effective paste wax,"I use this wax for waxing the wheels on my cars and use a different wax for the car's paint. The overall durability is pretty decent, and lasts at least a month. I can't say exactly how long, since I don't go more than a month before cleaning my car. The result is that there is visibly less brake dust accumulated on the wheels.Applying this wax is easy. For buffing off, make sure you don't leave the wax on for more than a few minutes. Otherwise, it hardens and requires noticeably more effort to buff off.The metal lid to the container requires a screw driver to pop open, as it's wedged closed pretty tightly.There is a fairly strong, sickly sweet smell to the wax. I don't find it repulsive, but others have commented that they found it somewhat offensive. As such, you might want to make sure you're applying it in a well ventilated space!Overall, it's tough to beat the effectiveness and usability of this paste wax for less than $10!"
5,Best car wax ever!,"This is the best car wax ever! Lasts a long time, weathers well. This is the only wax my family will use."
2,pieces,"this watch is very nice, but it seem to be build in a cheap way , today 6 months later since i got it , i droop it and the glass just pop out of watch and broke into pieces, i feel so dissapointed about this product ."
3,Stylish Watch but horrible smell.,Really The title says it all. I took a long time selecting this watch because the aesthetic features and size were perfect for my style and smaller wrists. I would have gladly given this watch a four or five star rating if the polyurethane strap on this watch did not have such a strong rubber smell. I am hoping the smell will fade but if not I will have to factor in another 20 or thirty for a high quality Italian rubber strap which has a much more pleasant smell.
4,"Wonderful and Well Made, but Watch Out for the HUGE Staples attached","I would have given this 5 stars, except that the company dediced to attach a large carboard label / advertisement to the mats and the two mat ends came stapled together with a HUGE Heavy-Duty Staple. I was very very careful to try to remove it without making the holes larger, but the staple still wiggled around and tore the staple holes larger.It should not have ANY holes in it when purchased.Other than the stapled ends on arrival, this mat is excellent quality and I am very happy with it.I am using it to go over the Husky Rear FLoor Liners for my MiniVan, as there is not enough traction and way to hold dirt in place with the regular Husky Liners, so this runner works PERFECTLY and does not slide around and is a perfect match in color."
4,Fits great in 1999 Jeep Cherokee,I put thison the floor in the back seat area of my 99 Jeep Cherokee. It fits great. I didn't have to do any cutting. Nice clean look.Geep
5,Great!,Very good quality! Looks great & keeps any debris from going on my carpets. I love the fact that I could cut to fit. Very happy with purchase!
2,Not for the Euro-sleaze fan,"As mentioned previously, this film does not belong in a Euro-sleaze connoiseur's collection. It has very little nudity (by comparison), no sex, and actually seems to tell a story, believe it or not. How much further could it be from a Rollin or Franco film?So don't buy this thinking you're getting a skin flick, because you'll be let down."
2,Spining Leiber,"A good enough film to watch, but why o why do people have to just take a name from a book ,and place a known char. in a completely unrelated story? Fritz lieber is spining in his grave, even though he probably did not invent Baba Yaga. She joins the sad list of Conan(I), The Dunwich Horror, most of the Dracula and Frankenstien, and Doc Savage; with the american Godzila thrown in. If you are going to change the story, charachters, motives, location and timeline; please go ahead and change the name as well. The movie would still be good, and there would not be so many hard feelings from those who read."
1,Fast forward review,"A real zero. There's only one sex sleaze scene, a whipping administered by a leather-trussed blonde while an older lady looks on. It's so late in the movie I almost gave up, my fast-forward thumb got tired. It's marginal. A half star, maybe. That's it, sorry, the reputation of this stupid thing obviously isn't grounded on sleaze."
1,The cast is totally wrong,"If you are looking for Kiss Me Kill Me with Stella Stevens and Bruce Boxleitner, this is NOT IT. Both Blockbuster and Amazon have the wrong cast for this movie version. This KMKM is an Italian Fetish movie, not exactly what I was looking for. The KMKM version starring Boxleitner and Stevens has never been made into a retail version."
4,Suspira meets Blowup,Classic euro trash camp: People moving their mouths out of sync with words...check. Lots of interesting visuals from another time period...check. Tantalizing plot with occasional nudity...check. Worth every penny. Caroll Baker (Babydoll) is the mysterious 'Baba Yaga' and George Eastman is such a hottie! Delizioso! Weird alert for this great Italian film is the dominatrix doll...huh? And the spell placed on Valentina's camera. Just pure fun with film.
2,Great looks...bushings went bad after 7 months...,I have a busy nail salon in WI...this nail dryer did a good job while it lasted. However the bushings went bad and it sound like a tank...only had it for about 7 months and I can no longer use it on clients.
3,nice,"The machine is o.k. I didn't give it 4 stars because I feel that the air that comes out could be stronger. I like the uv light though. It definately speeds up the drying time somewhat. It takes a good 15 - 20 minutes for your nails to be completely dry, which is better than the hour to hour in half I'd spend without the machine. This machine is definately not the same quality as they have in the nail salons, but I think you'd be better with than without. In the future, if this machine for some reason breaks, or if my daughter takes it from me, I may invest and spend the money on the professional ones that they use in the salons."
2,Not much air output. Returned it.,"I was disappointed in this dryer. I have natural nails and was more concerned with the cool air option. What attracted me to the unit was that it was a 2 hand dryer.The air ouput (or lack of) was terrible. You can get better air output with a small desktop fan for under $10. The unit is also noisy. For the $63 I paid, I really expected a more solid product.One thing the website doesn't tell you is, the UV light doesn't operate while in the pedicure position. Also, the website states the UV light will work with the cool air option and that's incorrect. You have to select warm air (for acrylic nails) for the UV light to come on.Returned the unit and then had to pay shipping both ways. $25 mistake. Read the reviews carefully before buying."
2,Not worth the money,It's been 6 months since I bought the dryer and it's already making a weird sound. Wish I had read the reviews before wasting my money.
2,"ok, bad customer service","When my mother in law asked me what I wanted for Christmas I told her to get me this. She said she wasn't going to get it so I bought it myself. To my surprise at Christmas, she bought me this product. This wasn't a product shipped from amazon so I contacted the seller and the would not let me return one b/c it was purchased over 30 days prior to when I received it. The product doesn't seem to work that great either. I've used it a couple times but find it easier to just let my toe nails dry as I walk around the house doing chores instead of having to sit still under the dryer..."
4,"It's pretty good, but fan motor sounds cheap","I have used this twice since I bought it. It works well, helps dry nails faster than nothing. The only potential concern I have is that the fan motor has a buzz and sounds really cheap. I hope they will honor the warranty if the fan motor breaks."
3,ray j,I like this song. Ray J is an Ok artist. He needs to grow up an leave the trashy reality shows alone. I think he could appeal to a broader audience if he does. I would recommend this to others.
4,Wonderful story,A wonderful story that each of us can relate to as it takes place in the not to distant past. Give a life style of a Georgia hill county family and how a family works together. Great story.
4,Christmas Quilt Book,"Book was in condition, as described. Was a bit longer in arriving, than I anticipated, but probably due to overload of holiday mailings."
5,As expected,Very good condition for a used book. Very helpful to me. Book was sold to me as advertised. Would buy here again.
1,Single Jar is Lonely,"Although the description clearly states that this is for a ""set of 6"", I received only one jar. It is a nice jar but it misses the other five members of it's family."
5,Very good product,"Bought it to store lentils, spices and cookies. Vacuum sealing is awesome. Everything remains very fresh. Good buy. Will buy again if we need more."
3,chips/cracks,"bottles were roughed up during shipping, logos are chipped off and one minor cracked bottle."
5,Great for crafting liqueurs like Limoncello!,"We bought these to make fruit waters, and that was great, but we really didn't need six -- one would do. However, we have recently gotten into crafting liqueurs to gift to friends, and these turn out to be absolutely perfect for the aging parts. We are very happy that we got them!"
4,Do your research folks.,"I just bought two cases of 6 half gallon jars from Amazon for $19.59 each. Then, on my next trip into a local family owned grocery I saw the exact same Ball product regularly priced at $9.79 per case of 6. I got taken royally by Amazon. Free shipping indeed!"
4,They fixed it!,"They originally sent me only 6 jars, but the image had 12 jars, and there was no description to know the amount per case. I emailed them and did not get a response, but I gave them a bad review on Amazon and got a response quickly. They sent the additional jars right away, and I believe they changed the image on Amazon as well."
4,Quality Jars,Nice heavy duty jars. Good lids and solid jars. Surprised at how well the jars held up in shipping and all.
5,<3,"Ive been around canning my entire life, but recently started canning on my own. When I saw these jars I instantly wanted them. I cant keep thinking about what all I can fill them with... :)"
5,My sister recommended these,and I love them. I keep my pastas fresh in them. They're just large enough to hold a bag of pasta and keep any critters out.
5,Not Supposed to use them for Canning,I can't find any information on the web about canning in this size jar but they are fantastic for storing dry goods. I love that they are taller than most storage jars and make better use of the space between my shelves. My old storage jars had a huge foot print but weren't very tall. They took up too much shelf space and left wasted head room. These jars are a perfect fit for my shelves.
5,Amazon seller is Ace Hardware - go directly to them & save,"Wide-mouth half-gallon jars are great for pantry and refrigerator storage, craft supplies, more. They work with sealing machines too. Most importantly, though, Ace Hardware is the seller and you can order directly from them and get free shipping to your local store. Yep. Love Amazon and it's my go-to first for everything but my jars came directly from Ace. The shipping rate is very reasonable for something breakable if you don't have an Ace near you."
4,Thinner than expected but good quality,"The chain arrived in a big but elegant box, It seemed very thin when first looking at it, yet once I took it out the box and held the chain it did have good weight to it and was a good size as far as around the neck. This chain does not feel cheap and looks nice in style. I would recommend this product."
1,Hablemos Inglés 7.0: English For Native Spanish Speakers,"This product works only with my computer and not in any of my DVD players and moreso, it is very difficult to even set-up and you have to go thru a time-wasting registration process. I trashed it. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND IT AT-ALL to anyone. There is better out there, that works with both computer or DVD players and requires no registration."
1,this lipstick came out in 1991.,"How are they selling 20 year old lipstick?? GROSSI loved it back in the day, it was an awesome texture, looked very pretty. But that was 20 years ago!That has to be some kind of consumer product law violation. Blech."
4,"Good vest, but O'Neill is better","The flotation padding in this vest, compared to the youth O'Neill vest, isn't as thick and is stiffer. My kids tell me it's comfortable, but if I knew one was going in the drink, I'd prefer to have that kid wearing the O'Neill with more padding in front to keep the face up, and more flexible pads for better swimming ability.When I bought both brands at the same time, it was strictly so the kids would have a few different colors to choose from -- and while the Stearns is a good (4-star) vest, the O'Neill is a five star vest for about the same price."
3,Good but a little short on longer torsos,"Bought this for my nine-year old to go sailing occasionally. She's on the tall and slender side and this jacket is just a little bit short on her. It fits fine circumferentially and isn't loose there, which is why I'm keeping it. I'm not concerned it will come off at all, it just looks a little bit short."
2,waltz music,We needed waltz music to practice waltzing. The music on this cd is not by original artists. The cd is okay for what we needed in our little class. You wouldn't want it for listening only.
2,expected a lot better quality,"I bought these boots and after 3to4 months the insides were shot, and this was not from hard work, as I do inventory for my job. the plastic in the heal plate came out and kept cutting into my feet.. just expected for the price and the name a lot better quality."
3,Acme Anvils And Aches,"When I found out Chuck Jones passed away late February, my heart broke. In my opinion, he was the greatest animator of all time. His most famous pair, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, has captured audiences of all ages left and right.The 1993 video Crash Couse, reflects on some fantastic cartoons that were created by the animation pioneer. The cartoon collection continues the neverending chase in many exciting cartoons like Hip Hip Hurry, Scrambled Aches and Ready, Set, Zoom!In dedication to Chuck Jones, his famous pair, Road Runner and Coyote, still captures the hearts of millions. And that is what makes this crash course so great."
4,Great Road Runner VHS,"1. Going! Going! Gosh! (1952)2. Ready, Set, Zoom! (1955)3. There They Go-Go-Go! (1956)4. Hip-Hip-Hurry! (1958; it's such a greatly directed cartoon, but has such horrible canned music from John Seely)5. Scrambled Aches (1957)"
1,Save that dollar at the Redbox,"Whether or not Splice is a tounge-in-cheek tale, anallegory of Adam and Eve, a modern Frankenstien,or all of these, does not make it a profoundmasterpiece. I won't expound on the film's plot,acting, special effects, etc. as many have alreadydone that job so effectively.I was too disgusted and disappointed to click onthe ""Special Features"", but I imagine possible""Extended love and rape scenes""."
1,Misses the Mark !,"I am an actor, and former biochemistry major. I also enjoy Adrien Brody's work, thus I was very excite the minute I saw the first trailer for this film. All I can say is what a disappointment, the story is flat cheesy and predictable, there are several failed attempts to create any sort of suspense that never develops, and the potential scary moments are killed by the chesses montage of the scenes. I will skip these one on the DVD collection and wait to see what the fall releases bring along."
2,an unfocused mess on multiple levels,"Two scientists engaged in a dna splicing program decide to go the extra step by secretly adding some human genetics to the monstrous melange. Disaster ensues... but the plot takes a turn for the worse as well.This movie can't decide what it wants to be... part science fiction, part horror, part family drama, part social commentary. It collapses under its own weight from the writers trying to shoe-horn every little bit of scrap into it. They seem to think this is something ""profound"" in the way of being a self-perceived indictment of science playing God, but it just comes off as being pretentious and scatterbrained.The film never engaged me and is ultimately forgettable, but for now it's enough in my memory to leave a lingering aftertaste of annoyance. I've seen worse things (which is why I'll give it 2 stars) but there's no question there's better things out there to waste an evening on."
5,Fun Movie!!!!,I loved the hell out of this movie! It's a great sci-fi horror movie so if you enjoy horror and sci-fi movies you'll love this movie!
3,50/50,"The trailers are a bit misleading. Once you get over that, the movie has some good spots but overall its just so/so. If you like the genre its probably worth a rent but only if you are a fan. I watched this in the theater and was disappointed as its totally a made for dvd movie."
2,eclairs crossed with caterpillars in a cage fight,"Not an intelligent expose of ethical dilemmas with genetic manipulation as the PR campaign suggested.Not original.Not shocking.Not well scripted.Not sexy.Not scary.Not funny.Not involving.Not much of anything really, except a big PR campaign."
1,Morbid curiosity....,....is the only thing that kept me watching this movie to the end. It seems like a disaster from the beginning and I kept going primarily to see if it could get any worse - I truly had no hope that it would ever redeem itself. I paid two dollars at a Blockbuster going out of business sale and even that was too much. Don't waste your time or money.
4,More Mutant Love!...,"Two geneticists, played by Adrien Brody (OXYGEN, THE JACKET) and Sarah Polly (DAWN OF THE DEAD, NO SUCH THING), develop a female, human / animal hybrid. They name her DREN (yep, NERD backwards). DREN seems OK at first, but this is a horror film after all, so, unbelievable terror awaits! The idea of ""Don't play god"" (aka: ""Don't mess around w/ nature"") is older than this or any movie. SPLICE is a modern take on this theme, w/ the scientists facing the ethical / moral dilemma of their creation, as well as it's lethal potential. DREN is a well-realized, FX creature, and has several surprises in store. SPLICE does have it's silly moments (the dance lesson!), but makes up for this w/ originality. Recommended..."
1,STORY A+ HOWEVER.........A Few Flaws but they are BIGGIES!,"The overall story and acting is amazing BUT (and that's a big BUT) there is too much gratuitous ""F"" bombs and too many sex scenes. I'm so sorry but I really don't think ""scientists"" talk like a pack of sailors and dress like Rockers. The story could have been told without the sex scenes taking several minutes for each one. Is this an ""adult film"" or what? They should be embarrassed because that's the the kinda thing you throw in a movie when the story can't hold up on it's own. This movie could have until that junk was excessively put in."
5,"5 stars x 5,000,000",I will be recommending this movie to everyone I know. Every one who reads this should watch it. It will change your life.
1,D isturbing R idiculous E rratic N uts,"A totally disturbing film. What starts out very promising as great Sci-Fi rapidly devolves into a inter-species rape fest (whether statutory or actual). Too bad because the film had possibilities. We never learn the reasons why the creations do the things they do or for that matter the humans. It would have been nice to learn more about these characters and it would have helped to have a better writer as well. Clearly, Writer/Director Natali has issues, possibly Oedipal."
3,Splice,Quite a slow movie but very interesting. Reminded me of Species. The ending is intense... and disturbing. It was worth the $3.00 I paid for it.
3,Decent Sci-Fi Film Done In By Ludicrous Ending,"""Splice"" for the majority of the film's running time is an intelligent riveting sci-fi thriller. Then the preposterous ending lands like a giant thud and undoes what good will the film engendered for 95 percent of it's running time. Not to give away the farm the scriptwriters were probably going for a ""Demon Seed"" ending instead it's more reminiscent of ""Humanoids From the Deep"". That would be okay except the latter film was deliberately campy. I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater and give the film a one star review. Those unsuspecting be forewarned that the film's ending negates what could have been a really great film."
2,The kangaroo cockroach girl??? (SPOILER ALERT),"All I have to say is ....this movie had potential but it fell short big time. The story was so disjointed and aimless . I soon realized that it was all just an excuse to show off the special effects that created this creature . Which brings me to something else that bugged me .... what the hell was she supposed to have been spiced with , I mean she had kangaroo legs and cockroach wings WTH...SMH. And the the ""Piece de resistance"" THE SEX SCENE WITH ""DREN"" ...I guess from this ,one must glean that a dude with stick his willy just about anywhere . I hated this movie , and wish I could get a refund of my time. And wow what a step down for Adrien Brody."
2,Oh PLEEEEZEE...,"Nice idea, but the dialog was silly and trite, not to mention their was no plausible reason for creating this thing at all. The plot meandered all over the place and obviously there was little or no research into the science of biotechnology to support it. The film rushed through as quickly as it could with no real point to make except the same warning that was given to Victor Frankenstein with a bizarre sexual twist.. I don't see how this film created such a stir or that it even got produced."
1,.....Awkward.....,"You know those ""good touch, bad touch"" talks and dramatic presentations you saw when you were in elementary school. I have never felt so uncomfortable watching anything since this moment. This movie is full of Bad Touch. Its just that simple."
1,DREN IS DREADFUL,"Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play superstar geneticists with a knack for splicing DNA from diverse species to create new hybrids that can be used for pharmaceuticals. The Brody and Polley characters are also a couple when they go home from the lab.When a conflict with a sponsoring company bans some of their research, they continue, but hide their work. In fact, they take their work home with them. Big mistake.Driven by their dangerous curiosity, a fast growing mutant, humanoid-like creature, Dren, is the result of their secret experiments. Of course things get out of hand.This promising film goes off the rails and loses whatever theme it set out to explore.Too bad, there are lots of relevant issues here that resonate with daily headlines about the morality of harvesting embryonic cells. Also, I thought the creature was not consistent in its appearance.I think we were supposed to feel sympathy if not affection for Dren, but that never really came across."
3,Definately different and was not what I expected.,"This was, for lack of a better word, different....or just plain weird? I saw the trailer and, being a biologist myself, thought it would be right up my alley. This was a lot more science fiction than what I was hoping for but it does raise a lot of questions about the implications of DNA research. Afterwards, it really makes you wonder what kinds of research are being done out of the public eye. It's definately worth watching, but certain parts are not for the faint of heart....trust me."
3,A bizarre trip into the genetically joined worlds of science fiction and horror,"Director Vincenzo Natali deserves some praise for the unconventional and thought-provoking science fiction/sexual horror exploits of Splice. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley give satisfactory performances, and the creature effects are convincing and, at times, downright disturbing. French actress and model Delphine Chaneacis is Dren, the genetically engineered creation of Brody and Polley's scientists. The film begins with a bang and continues along an interesting and enjoyable path until regrettably devolving into the standard horror chase film by the third reel. Worth seeing due to it's bizarre and disturbing themes, but don't expect much more. 3 out of 5 stars."
3,"Excellent Movie, But Left Me Wanting More","***SPOILERS INCLUDED ***I finally had a chance to watch this movie and I will say that while I enjoyed it, there were moments in the movie that made it drag out. The whole sex scene between Clive and Elsa, then Clive and Dren, and then of course Elsa and Dren were way to drawn out and really dragged the movie down. A few simple seconds to show this would make sense, but to waste about 5 minutes on it was pointless. I was wondering why they kept showing this, until the end where they actually showed that Elsa was pregnant. The other problem with this was when Dren changed to a male and went on the attack; they only had this last about 10-15 minutes at the most. I wish they took alot more time to show more of the attack scenes, and have this creature go crazy.However overall I loved how they showed the development of Dren, and I thought the characters were relatable. I almost expect a Splice 2."
2,Excellent movie.,Great special effects and an ingeneous story line make for a special movie watching experience. One of my favourite movies of all time. Very realistic and believable. Highly recommended for Sci-fi buffs.
1,"Boring, boring, boring!","This was on sale at Best Buy for $5.99 (Halloween special,) so I picked it up. Man, it wasn't even worth the price I paid! In fact, I couldn't finish it! There was absolutely nothing scary about this movie. Splice plays out more like a poorly-written science fiction drama. The acting was only average at best. Some of the cinematography was fairly well done, but the over all plot killed it.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone that I like."
2,Scary and lively special effects + Only the first 40 minutes are suspenseful,"The special effects make Dren, the hybrid creature, look lively and scary.Only the first 40 minutes are suspenseful. After that, the movie becomes insipid, and predictable. What a waste! It has the potential to become a good science fiction."
3,Messed up family,"Splice is a movie about a couple, Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley, who are genetic engineers. They decide to splice genes with human DNA and end up with an almost human like creature which has amphibian and bird flight capabilities. Against their better judgment, they decide to keep the baby and study its lifespan. Obviously all good intentions are fraught with dangers and the movie shows us the dangers of humans trying to play good.If you have very low expectations, which I did, you will be pleasantly surprised. The creature turns against the humans but has a personality and the movie tries to delve in to its psyche. This Frankenstein type of saga is watchable. Three stars. 11/15/10"
1,"Disgusting, debasing, demoralizing","Sick, they should just rename it ""Sick"". Utterly disgusting, exactly how low can Hollywood go? I can't help not thinking about the Nuremberg trials, when I wonder how these psyop perverts in Hollywood should be dealt with if they are ever brought to justice for their role in the utter destruction of every conceivable moral value in the minds of people."
1,Total Crap!,The sex scene with the freak pretty much ruined it for me. Nevermind that it's a crap movie to begin with.
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen!,"This was horrible. It is in the top five of the worst movies I've seen, and I watch a LOT of films. The story was offensive and off-putting in so many ways, but also just a really awful script and film. I am shocked that actors of this caliber would put their names on this piece of garbage! If I could give it zero stars, I would!"
1,worst movie ever made,it starts off mildly interesting and then gets worse as the movie goes on. the scene where brody dances with the splice and everything that happens after that point should go down in history as some of the worst film making in history.
1,Really stupid movie,"If I get a movie from the library, and there isn't anything else on TV to watch, I try to at least watch the thing so my time was not wasted picking it up.I wasted my time anyway. This movie was not worth the effort of even putting it in the DVD player.The story line was lame. The boyfriend's going along blindly with his crazy ass girlfriend was lame. Acting as though they could actually pull off carrying on this whole experiment in secrecy was lame.And then the ultimate of lame: The sex scenes were disgustingly stupid.104 minutes shot all to hell. :p"
1,{Painfully Stupid,"Whew! The female and male lead roles were very...hmmmmmm...annoying. Stupid, actually. Both characters behaved so improbably for scientists that I had a difficult time not stopping the movie. Once started, I had to see where they took this story, so I only fast-forwarded periodically after the halfway point. The last few minutes were actually the best since both characters then began to behave as real people would behave. So, unless you really like strange movies with unbelievable characters, don't watch this movie (or at least wait until you can rent it for a buck). 'Sorry for the negative review, but it really was BAD."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Science Fiction is my passion. I write it, I read it, I watch it, & I love it, but movies like Splice are what keeps people away from the genre. This film is twisted, disgusting, and just messed up. Two scientists decide they can splice human and animal DNA to create a genetically perfect being. This being would naturally produce cures to many diseases and could change the world. The whole time I was waiting for this thing to go crazy and kill everyone, but it doesn't quite happen that way. First, the scientists treat it like a pet, than a baby, than they have sex with it... Oh no, I'm not joking! This film is disgusting! ...and how come everything these scientists make looks like a big penis? Seriously, I have never seen something that is just so pointless and disturbing. I can honestly say I wish I hadn't seen this film."
1,Splice,"Splice totally sucks! I rented it as no way would i buy it, nor even want it if it was free... These 2 Biologists are making these blob like things and they create a thing which is sort of human..They keep the thing hidden and it matures into an adult..i suppose..The ending was weird too. The story was overall boring.."
1,Sucked,I wish I would have read the reviews here before I spent my money and time on this movie.I can't say anything more than it really sucked.
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This belongs on the worst movie ever made list. Towards the middle, you will wish that you could get back the time you wasted watching it."
1,UNGODLY PURE BEASTIAL FILTHY RUBBISH!,"IF you don't want to risk being sent to hell, IF you don't want to forfeit your salvation, switch the channel or turn the TV off and read a good book, one that will elevate you. Do not purchase this EVIL rubbish. Don't go out of your way to plant this filth into your soul. I will not look with approval on anything that is vile. I hate what faithless people do; I will have no part in it."" - PSALM 101.3"
2,Very disturbing - No spoilers.,"This is not a review for the DVD, it is for the movie itself.The previews for this movie were misleading I thought, making it look like a thriller. This is not a thriller, it is more of a sci-fi drama. At the very end it does turn a little ""thriller""ish - for about 10 minutes.I found this movie very disturbing. And for everyone who would care to be forewarned, there is a rape scene.I was not aware of this when I saw the movie. I believe people should be warned of such scenes.This is not to say the movie is not ""good,"" just that I personally did not like it."
2,"Oh, my gosh!","The previews looked so fun! But this movie actually repulsed me. It's morally uncomfortable to see egotistical scientists clone anything in a movie, let alone a human-animal clone, but then to have sex with it! My skin was crawling. If there was a moral message of some kind in this movie, it escaped me."
1,Disgusting,If you have any moral or values you won't like a few of the messed up adult scenes which ruins the movie. Just wrong.
2,Cannot be unseen,"Good concept, but terrible delivery.The sex scenes are incredibly awkward, and the latter scenes are borderline bestiality.I recommend you watch this alone because it WILL get awkward if you watch it with your friends or your SO."
3,Quick Review - Passable & Relevant Sci-Fi Horror Flick,"This is a quick review on the Blu-Ray version of Splice (rented at Queen Video in Toronto)Passable creature flick with a good script and decent cast. Blu-Ray version didnt have anything outstanding in picture quality that a regular DVD would capture. No stunning scene scapes, creature effects were almost human so you would do fine withe either version.This would appeal to fans for the Cronenburg version of the fly, albeit without the gore factor. Although there is one moment in the film with Adrian Brodie that is just crazy.Its a fun film overall. Don't have high expectations and its worth your time but probably not a buyer unless you are right into the genre."
3,A BAD HUMAN EXPERIMENT,THE MOVIE WAS A OK MOVIE SOMEWHAT STRANGE. THE EXPERIMENT THAT WENT WRONG IN MAKING A BABY WHICH CAME OUT TO BE PART HUMAN AND PART MONSTER WITH A KILLER TAIL.
1,New worst movie ever...,"Don't waste your time or money.This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Any other awful movie I've seen in my entire life is now obsolete.The science is interesting - far out but interesting.... but that's all lost because the ""scientists"" are so unbelievably stupid. Some examples:This creature stabbed me with its stinger and threw me into convulsions - let's put it in a dress and pretend it's our daughter!Hey, the thing I made in a lab and is bizarre in every imaginable way looks a LITTLE like a chick - I think I'll have sex with it!When our genetic experiment that we know virtually nothing about ""dies"" - lets bury it in the back yard, not burn it. We'll burn EVERYTHING else though.Anyone who writes a review about this movie greater than one star needs to quit crystal meth."
1,Just plain bad..........,"I watched this film for free on some satellite movie channel, and believe me, it wasn't worth it - even at that price. I'm stunned that two talented actors like Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley were in this dog of a movie. I love great science fiction and I'm willing to suspend a fair amount of disbelief to enjoy a nice film, but that simply wasn't possible in this case. The movie is silly and implausible from beginning to end and revolves around two brilliant scientists who make infinitely stupid, unethical decisions - one after the other. With bad CGI and gripping dialogue between Adrien and Sarah like, ""I don't even know who you are anymore"", this is a film to avoid. Dumb."
2,terrible,"Adrien Brody plays the weak-minded scientist that is lead and manipulated by his girl friend scientist at every single turn. The role appears to be non-essential. As a matter of fact, I think Sarah Polley's role alone will suffice the entire movie."
3,Decent Sci-fi,"I bought this on my B-day on a whim just wanting to see some decent sci-fi, I got my copy from Target. I don't care for the cast, but do like the basic story and just enjoy the strange aspects of the plot. So it's just decent, nothing great. Scientists in a relationship, working together so synthesize a hybrid life form for scientific exploitations."
3,Average horror flick,"Nothing too exciting here that wasn't spoiled with the previews. I could have done without this movie and aside from killing some time that otherwise would have been spent on farce-book, only that made it better."
2,Had potential,"The story had potential, there are so many things that could have made this a better movie. But for me the most problematic was the acting and the dialog.Here are two supposedly intelligent people creating life, but at no point in the movie did you ever find that plausible. The dialog was something you'd get out of grade school, and the actions taken by the two main characters was just ridiculous. Not even just what they did to create the creature, but afterwards, it just was too implausible. I don't mind suspending belief for a good fantasy or sci fi movie, but the characters have to at least be something you can connect with. The female lead just acted like a spoiled brat the entire movie, a complete distraction. There seems to be no cohesive flow from one set of actions to another, no believable justifications for their actions and decisions.The only performance that wasn't a distraction was that of the creature they created. That part was actually fairly well done."
2,Horror,"I saw this movie in theaters.. From the previews before it came out, it was advertised as a horror movie, they showed a few scary parts, etc.. The first bit of horror in this movie didn't happen until about 15 minutes until the movie was about to end. That right there was a turn off to me. I sat there watching it asking myself ""When does the killing that the previews showed happen?"""
1,Vulgar,"I almost always agree with Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone magazine. Well maybe he was partly right when he wrote ""Provocative"" . It provoked me to throw the movie out."
4,"Great -- Strange, not what I thought....","I've a feeling, that some, like me, are going to watch this twice. It sort of sneaks up on you, science fiction at it's greatest is always able to do this, for me: make the world they're creating, real to me, make it all believable ... make it all cohere, and then slip in 'the idea.'They have brought forth this 'creature.' Sort of a lab rat, only human DNA...all makes sense, and they do it so well, mostly because they don' *over* do it, the creature is about what I imagine would come about. What got me all twisted tho, was that the creature seemed female, and got sexier and sexier, to where I was kind of turned on by 'it.' I didn't feel *too* weird tho, since Adrean Brody was too...But aside from all that silliness: it was a good movie, hard to predict, and it got spooky towards the end...I enjoyed it. :)"
1,Idiotic movie,"My friend picked this for a movie night. One of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen. Can't believe a best actor Oscar winner would agree to this unbelievable premise. It's not even acceptable as a sci-fi, where you sometimes have suspend normal rationale. Adrian Brody had to be desparate to work."
3,"Brilliant CG effects, fascinating underlying concept.... but something still kinda stupid.","Was it worth the $2.99? Yeah, I guess so.Would I pay it again? Not to see it a second time, but I'm glad I saw it once.The creature designs are VERY Patricia Piccanini-esque, which is why I wanted to see it, and I'm interested in explorations of the moral ambiguity of some aspects of genetic research. But at a point, it just got kind of silly, and there were all these weird vague back stories to the two main characters that <could> have been really interested and interwoven with the main conflict more, but for some reason were left half-baked. And, of course, the sum moral that ""genomic fiddling is bad"" sort of irks me in its simplicity, but I wasn't really expecting anything brilliant on that end. I mean, it's a creature feature: as such, it's a good time, watch it! But it does make me wish somebody would take a stab at the same concept, with the same creatures, but more, err, seriously."
2,Predictable and Disappointing,"The premise of the movie should have made for a good storyline. DNA splicing resulting in Chimeras and other hybrids is still fairly new in experimental science, however this ""thriller"" was old, dull, and predictable. Adrien Brody's great acting talent was wasted in this so called drama. It seemed as though the actors were not taking the dramatic portion of the storyline seriously; it felt more or less like a tongue and cheek presentation. The only portion of the drama that worked, and was believable, was the sensual attraction the male geneticist's character (Clive) had for the experimental hybrid (Dren)."
3,Unique and realistic human behavior,"I give 3 stars because the movie is like nothing you have seen, except for the last 5 minutes when the author lost imagination and needed to end it some how.Not worth owning, but great to watch 1 time."
2,Not all that great,"I really does not last as long as the regular battery. My intention was to replace the battery that came with it because it was dying, however this things lasts as long as dying battery I already have. Not too thrilled."
2,LG CU 500 Battery,"The battery works fine, but it doesn't last as long as the original battery that comes with the new bought cell phone. This battery last about 3/4 of a day with out very little calling involved. Other than that, it is a good back up battery for my cell phone."
2,Poor Battery Life,"I bought this to replace the bad battery on my phone, this new battery had a very short life, I found my self having to charge it every night."
4,If your child loves the show Wild Kratts...,"...they'll love this toy. My 6 year old loves Wild Kratts and started getting really into all the different animals of the world. Since I had yet to find any Wild Kratts themed action figures, etc, I decided on these. Now he loves all the Wild Republic animal sets. The addition of the explorer really promotes role playing, and the animals are well done with their details and variety. I would have given it 5 stars if the long tails on some of the animals didn't snap off in my toddler's hands - the tails are able to move, and they can pop out of the larger animal's backsides. However the ""baby animals"" moveable tails actually ended up snapping right off. The tail movement doesn't really add anything to the fun playing experience - they easily could have been stationary and therefore more stable. But 5+ yr olds most likely won't be playing with the animals like a toddler would! So the tails should hopefully stay on in those cases..."
4,"Nice smoke detector, but light is not bright","I found that the light is nearly useless -- even in a completely dark hallway it didn't really shed enough light to adequately see the floor - about all it was good for was seeing the location of the smoke detector on the ceiling. I wish it had a bright LED light instead of a not-so-bright incandescent light.But aside from the light brightness I have no real complaints, it was easy to install with the included wiring harness. I couldn't test the interconnection feature - oddly, my house is wired for hardwired smoke detectors, but they only included the 2 power wires, there's no third signal wire to interconnect with the other detectors."
3,Be careful of the batteries,I like these smoke detectors and replaced my ten year old ones just because of age. After about two months I started getting the nuisance chirp that I have heard other people talk about. At first I thought it was the air or moisture from my swamp cooler but then the one downstairs was doing it too. After some investigation I found that the long life batteries that the units came with were no good and that is what was really causing the problem. New Duracell's solved the problem and everything is good again. Lesson- don't believe the hype of the long life batteries.
4,"Works great, is loud, easy to install","As far as I know, it works. The light is bright, the alarm is loud. We we burn something in the kitchen, the silence button works too. Was easy to install."
3,Hemingway and THE SPANISH EARTH,"For most readers interested in the work of Ernest Hemingway, the 1937 independent film THE SPANISH EARTH offers a small but intriguing window into the famous writer's world as a war correspondent during the late 1930s. Like most of the journalists based in Madrid and sympathetic to the Republican cause, Hemingway saw Franco's fascist rebellion as a prelude to what the Germans and Italians had in store for Europe in the coming years. Of considerable interest is Hemingway's own narration for the film -- even though Orson Welles was originally hired and is still credited -- and we can feel Papa's passion and respect for the freedom fighters and their valiant struggle for the land they love. In the end, we are witness to a bygone world where patriotic songs fill the air alongside simple military tactics and primitive armaments -- all in a vain attempt to preserve a Spain that would never be the same again."
2,"Far from an ""encyclopedia""","For an ""encyclopedia"" this book is severly lacking in detail and coverage on the subject. This is a thin book that gives very short descriptions of a limited number of treatments. Many very common and popular spa treatments are not even included, while other obscure and non-existent in most spas found their way into the book. If you're looking for information on what is done during many of the common spa treatments used today and what their benefits are I do not suggest this book. I was very disappointed."
5,"""The Spa Encyclopedia: A Guide to Treatments & Their Benefits for Health and Healing""",I needed this book for professional and educational purpose. This issue fulfilled my expectations. Besides the price was definitely acceptable.
2,Good while it worked,"This item is attractive and chops very well. However, mine stopped spinning between chops after about 2 weeks. Now I have to manually spin it after every chop.As the other reviewers said, it is a pain to put back together. I almost always have to ask my husband to do it."
2,Not what I had hoped for.,"This chopper looked like the perfect tool, but I never could get it to work right. Food jammed in the cutters, it didn't cut/chop cleanly all the way through the food, like onions. Not so easy to take apart and clean, or put back together. Could've been just me, but wasn't too happy."
2,No longer functioning,"I received this as a gift last year (after putting it on my wish list) and used it a couple of times. To clean it, you undo the few parts that it has and put it in the dishwasher, which is great. But, the main housing has a black plastic part that fits over the zig-zag blade and has to be in place for the chopping to work. Well, I can no longer get that black part to fit over the blades. I tried for about 10 minutes tonight and finally threw the damn thing in the garbage. So frustrating. Either the blades bent or the plastic thing changed shape a bit - it has to fit the zig-zag of the blades just perfectly in order to work. I give up."
2,it did work fine for a couple of weeks but then....,"The handle you depress to push down the chopping mechanism is built in two parts. Mine has come apart and I can not figure out how to get the parts back together. This makes my chopping frustrating when it usually is one of the more fun parts to cooking. (for me anyway) This is disappointing, but you get what you pay for. That lesson is coming back to haunt me time and time again."
4,Assertive Discipline for Parents,"Every time I feel myself falling into unconstructive patterns of handling my children, I re-read this book. It renews my confidence to deal with everyday parenting challenges by ""putting the ball in their court"". As they grow, Assertive Discipline for Parents grows with them because it contains suggestions for all ages."
4,Great book for parents,I think the book offered lots of great advice for parents who have no ideas of where to begin. I also think it did alot to dispel notions of the effects of harsh discipline and verbal abuse.
4,Very nice set,Bought for a friend who kept handing out butter knives to cut steak with. Very elegant and nicely weighted knives. Given the options for steak knives these rank very high in my books.
5,Great knives at a great price and easy to care for,"I'm surprised at all the reviews discussing ""stains"" on these knives. We use these knives ALL THE TIME, throw them in the dishwasher with no special handling, and ours have no stains. The knives are perfectly balanced, RAZOR sharp, and easy to cut with. Our guests often ask where we got them. We have had these knives for 4-6 years now. I bought the original set at a local big box discounter that starts with a ""T""... I found the price on Amazon is better for the same product.Let's see....anything critical to say... pretty much they're perfect. Would be great if they came in sets of 8 vs sets of 6.Highly recommended!"
4,Good knives,"My husband prefers serrated steak knives and we've had a similar Henckel set before. They're good for casual use and a good price. You can tell they're not the top of the line but they're not cheap, box-store stuff. A good purchase."
2,Bigger handles needed.,"These are nice knives but the handles are far too small and thin for the average person. I have medium sized hands and these handled are uncomfortable to hold and cut with. Handle thickness is about twice the width of the blade...that's pretty thin.I own a 10 pc Henckels Twin Select set I love, it has perfect ergonomics and balance. Maybe I am holding the company to too high a standard for a $40 set, but hey, they set the bar."
3,Small But Well Made,"I bought these steak knives about 3 years ago because they were stainless steel and looked nice. As I unpacked them I realized the handle was about 1/4"" too short/small for most adults, but I've continued to use them. Darned if I know exactly why. But, they cut steaks well, clean up easily and always look nice - that might be it. Since I just drop them in a drawer they do take stresses daily, but they've remained sharp and haven't rusted. If you have trouble cutting a steak with these, you need a new butcher."
3,does the job,the knives do the job of cutting and slicing very well. I don't likethe handle but it is a good grip and should hold up very well given thedesign.
5,Nice Steak Knife,We bought them because they were cheap and all stainless steal. They do the job for us but we don't use them for steak really since we are vegetarians!
2,Junk! Buyer beware..,These are all show and no go!!! The butter knife in flatware set cuts a steak easier then these. Even the 29.99 price is high cause these could be had in a dept store for cheaper.
4,Better than our other brand knives,"I bought these knives at Target several years back. Although they *occassionally* get dishwasher stains on the handles, the blades themselves never get dishwasher stains on them, which is important to me; my girlfriend bought a different set of stainless steel steak knives (different manufacturer) that consistently come out of the dishwasher with massive rust stains on the blades themselves, which makes me not use them (who wants to eat rust). This makes me appreciate the Henckels set even more: I would definitely recommend this Henckels set."
2,Stainless - NOT!,"These were sent instead of the black-handled set I ordered so I thought I would give them a try. They are listed as ""dishwasher safe"", but evidently are not. Brown stains (rust?) appeared on the tops of all the handles. I cleaned them with silver polish, but the stains reappeared with subsequent washings. I have returned them and received a refund."
5,"Great sharp knives, good weight/balance, and excellent feel in your hand!","I got this steak knife set to go with a 45 piece flatware set from JA Henckels and was not disappointed. I am extremely happy I purchased this set along with the Henckels flatware set and both sets should last for decades. The knives are sharp, have a sold feel, look great, and are reasonably priced as it appears this set will provide years of cutting meat with ease. I highly recommend this set and thoroughly enjoy them myself. After friends have used them they usually ask where I got these because they are so impressed with the solid feel and ease in cutting meat they want a set of their own. If you get the woodblock too they look great on the counter."
4,great knives for a very good price,This is the only set of steak knives that I have ever owned. That being said I can tell you that these knives are sturdy and up to the task of cutting meat superbly. $30 is dirt cheap too.
2,NOT SHARP OR COMFORTABLE but Good Looking,"These knives look great, but are too small in the hand and have a poor serration design. I eat a lot of steak and I am a professional chef. The knives will actually start to hurt your hand when eating a rare ribeye steak."
1,Alarmist and overly pessimistic,"Armed with ""facts"" from selective and questionable sources, Maudlin is not very convincing; if the Fed thought a ""Y2K Recession"" was on the short-term horizon, they would be lowering rates not raising them! Does Maudlin claim he has access to better information than Alan Greenspan?"
2,Pure fiction at best,"John Mauldin sounds the bell for creating a Bear market. The only investor who could benefit from such pessismistic ""scenarios"" will be Mauldin from the sale of this book. Do yourself a favor... don't short sell your wallet or your stock."
5,A writing teacher's most valuable find.,An invaluable resource! I have been using the progymnasmata to teach writing for two years and I have been looking for a book like this. This book provides richness and depth to understanding the progymnasmata exercises by placing them squarely into the rhetorical handbook tradition. It will give me and my students an even better understanding than before.
4,Good by Wishcraft is better,"This is a good book, but if you only wanted to purchase one book I would recommend you purchase Wishcraft (same author)."
2,too cute and simplistic for those who have been around,"Personally I found the ""exercises"" too simplistic, but I have been around the bend and back again with my life choices.May be appropriate for a newbie to the life/career adventure circuit. ;-)"
1,A waste of time,I bought this book based on a recommendation given during a session aimed at helping employees prepare for retirement. I found the book disappointing and full of the sort of liberal arts twaddle that passes for wisdom but is not at all helpful for someone looking into retirement options.
1,YOU BELONG TO ME,I found this very slow and not very interesting at all. it drags on too much and doesn't keep you focused on the story.
4,Shock Much?,"This little gag prank is pretty neat. It can take some drops and hits. It can make someone get out of bed. I`m not really ""in"" to this stuff, but this is pretty cool."
5,shocking gum,"ordered 2 , one didnt work, sucks when you have two boys and only one working shocking gum pack, they sent me 2 more for free"
4,good practical joke,"My grandson says it's a fun practical joke. The rest of my relatives weren't quite so excited about it, but they were good sports. It works as promised."
5,shocking gum,The shocking gum was exactly as described. Nice gag gift or just something to joke around with. Would purchase again.
3,"My 8 year old loves it, but be aware of other parents' anger","My kid loves this toy. It shocks enough to scare you but not hurt. One parent on the street did get upset about it so she cant take it outside anymore. I also had to explain she can only trick kids her age or older. Over all, the product works and is durable. It still scares me when I get shocked :)"
3,Shock gum review,"I wasn't able to fool anyone with ,they new it was fake because it doesnt look very realistic it says pull here with an arrow pointing to where the big peice of suspicious metal that you pull is. after being dropped on the concrete like 5 times hard its still intact and works with a really powerfull electric shock that will numb your finger,very durable."
1,Too much of a shock,"Wow, this toy really packs a shock! My son tried it on me and I almost hit the ceiling the shock was so powerful. Definitely not recommended. Someone could really get hurt. We had to get rid of it. Absolutely not for children."
5,great,i love this shocking pack of gum the only problem is everyone doesn't trust me so they suspect it will shock them.
2,Cheap fun,This toy is very cheaply made and doesn't last long when played with. It was long after the first use that it broke to pieces.
3,DANGEROUSLY FUNNY,"This toy is NOT A TOY! I cannot believe how much the shock acutally HURTS. We laughed hysterically though, and did have a lot of fun. But now it's just plain dangerous. Be very careful with leaving it around for children to accidentally get a hold of. I have two four year olds who would love to play with this, but it's just tooooooooooo painful to even let them come near it."
1,Don't Get This Product,This is a horrible product. I suggest you do not get it. It hurt me a lot and it is dangerous. It could seriously injure someone. It was not a fun toy and it is a waste of money.
3,Nice gag,"I always like pulling pranks on friends and family, its kind of my the trademark, although its not my best or original, it makes for a nice cheap gag...even better when you put a real wrapper around it...I bought it to meet my 25 min to get my add ons to ship...the items I really needed..."
2,Too much shock to be a fun prank,Almost a little to shocking for kids... as a parent the shock was quite uncomfortable & could be felt up into your arm. Similiar the the feel of licking a 9V lol
2,Ehhh...,"This was very fun for a while, until the battery died about 2 days after it arrived. Did i mention it took about 1 month to deliver???"
1,Freaky,I purchased these as stocking stuffers. Some had a mild electric charge while others were freakishly strong. I made sure I wasn't standing in water when they were around. They went in the trash.
2,"Works great, if you can convince somebody to grab it","Not only does the label actually clearly and boldly says ""SHOCK pull here"". Even if you cover that with your thumb, the ""gum"" in the package is clearly plastic with two lines in it to make it try to appear like sticks of gum. The stick sticking out is a thick piece of plastic with a gray sticker on the top and bottom. It looks COMPLETELY fake. I only got people to pull it after we laughed about how bad it looked and they tried it for fun.From the reactions, it packs a decent punch and I'm still too afraid to pull it myself."
2,Poor,When I purchased this item I was unaware that it was going to be very strong. The shock could still be felt after 5 min. It is unsafe.
5,Excellent Movie! But it needs DVD treatment,This is a must for Bronson fans. Its about a simple melon picker who fights the evils of society .
4,Movies,I like all Charles Bronson movies. I like the way he protects the things that are his when pushed to far.
3,Bronson uses his melon,"Mr. Majestyk (Charles Bronson) is a melon farmer hell-bent on getting his crop in and woe to any who stand in his way. His job is not made any easier when he runs afoul of a local punk (Paul Koslo) and a mafia hit man (Al Lettieri). Given the subject matter, this is obviously not a film that takes itself too seriously. It's a fast-paced flick with a screenplay by novelist Elmore Leonard and some very effective action scenes. A good example of the ""man alone"" low-budget action flicks that were made in the 70s."
3,bronson kicks ass with a shotgun,"I loved this movie when it came out and have seen it a few times on TV. Can't wait to see it again on DVD with all the violence.This movie and the Getaway with Steve McQueen were must see Movies in the 70's. You can add Dirty Harry and Magnum Force too.Bronson is so cool. He could make you freeze just by looking at you. He wastes some dudes with a shotgun that was way cool in the 70's and still good now. Violence back then was better, more dramatic, more shocking, more cool than the current overkill fake stuff that they make now. It was more real back then."
4,mr.majestic,charles bronson plays a colorado melon grower who runs afoul of the mafia. who want to put him out of business.but mr.majestyk is one tough customer!!! solid mid 70s action flick!!
4,Mr. Majestyk,"Mr. Majestyk is a fast paced movie. The part that bothers me is they never say that it was filmed all around the La Junta, CO area. Coming from the area I like to see the old buildings and such."
5,Classic,"Charles Bronson was the role model for other macho actors (Eastwood, Van Damme, etc.). This movie is simplistic compared to the gristle and gore of modern films of the genre, but is true to its story and motive. His understated acting is classic to his genius and his appeal."
5,Charlie B at his best!,"I just love this film! It is definitely an oldie but a goodie. We had it on VHS when I was a kid and I think I wore the tape out watching it over and over again! Have always loved Charles Bronson, and this is just one of his best. A tough, unassuming, kick arse hero. You can't get any better than that. Love the car chase scene in his old pick up and with some classic one liners, Mr Majestyk is a great one for a rainy day or any day! They just don't make 'em like they use to! Glad to find a DVD of it still exists, its going into my basket right now!!"
4,satisfied,"I purchased this movie as a gift, so haven't viewed it, but it arrived in a timely fashion, so I was pleased."
2,Melonhead,"This is a ridiculously contrived revenge drama penned by one of the most over-rated hacks in America, Elmore Leonard. A melon farmer who happens to be an ace Vietnam combat veteran butts heads with a mob assassin. Happens every day. The film is packed with stereotypes, from the noble Chicano melon-pickers to the gruff police detective to the punk labor contractor to the polyester-enveloped 70's gangsters. It limps along from one poorly staged scene to another until Leonard apparently ran out of cliches. It should have been played for straight comedy since there are so many unintentional laughs in it. Charles Bronson was strictly a supporting character actor and when he stepped into leading roles he simply didn't have enough depth to put himself across."
3,The Watermelon Man,"""Mr. Majestyk"" is a classic of sorts in that it's the only film in history (of which I'm aware) to portray a watermelon farmer as the hero. Watermelons suffer the most during the violent moments in this Elmore Leonard penned film when bad guy Al Lettieri's thugs blast Charles Bronson's crop with machine gun fire, but Bronson gets his revenge in a memorable finale.I found it a little hard to believe that mob hitman Lettieri would be so determined to avenge himself against Bronson rather than flee to safety when he had the chance, but otherwise this is a pretty good '70s action pic, one that gives the usually stoic star more dialogue than usual. He even gets a rare chance to display a sense of humor in several scenes. It's also nice to see the beautiful Linda Cristal, best known for TV's ""The High Chaparral,"" as Bronson's love interest.Brian W. Fairbanks"
3,Bronson Just Wants To Pick His Mellons,This movie is entertaining as hell. It is a good 70's action movie. The cast is great and Bronson is at his best in his scenes with Paul Koslo and Al Lettieri. I love when he smashes big Al in the mouth in the diner! Classic!
4,Good looking and well-made.,"Nice piece. Perhaps feels just a little light when held, but it is quality workmanship for the price. I recommend it."
3,Nice bracelet,"The bracelet was nice. It's light weight, which I didn't really like but overall I think it was a good buy."
5,Lovely item!,I am so very pleased with this bracelet. I wasn't entirely confident when I placed my order but I am so very glad I did. I would highly recommend this bracelet for any woman.
4,A very good solo Raider entry,"""Death's Deal"" is a fine entry in the solo Raider Western novel series. This series of books focused on the character of Raider, working alone for the Pinkertons after Doc Weatherbee leaves the agency.Most of the plot is taken up with a grueling cattle drive, which brings out the courage and cowardice, good and evil of everybody involved. The major villain is more of a contemporary sociopath than the standard Western bad guy.The solo Raider books just don't have the quality of the earlier Hardin series, but this one is excellent.Highly recommended."
1,Dissapointed,"Not a bad book, just not what I was expecting given the other reviews. I was hopeing for less action and more insight into the ""killer virus"". Could have used a more medical twist."
