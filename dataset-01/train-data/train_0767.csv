5,This must be the most comfortable way for baby!,"Why put your newborn in a hard plastic seat, when you can have him/her lie on a virtual pillow? My kitchen sink is one of those not evenly split; it has a tiny section on one side and extra wide on the other and this bather fits perfectly into it. My baby has never cried (not even the first time)in this. Why should he? He's covered in warm water, has his head propped up just right, and is on a soft pillow. The really great thing about this bather is that it becomes heavy when wet, so it won't slide around. But when you squeeze some of the water out, it instantly becomes light again. Simply brilliant! Don't even consider any of the others - this one is perfect!!!"
3,BETTER THAN PLASTIC TUBS --SINKS IN USE!,"To tell you the truth, the this bather is only good when you are in the tub too. The reason is because the safe bather fills with water, and it sinks, therefore, it will get water in your baby's ears if you don't watch it. My husband and I found that it works only when you place the safe bather on your feet and have the water level really low. It doesn't float as I hoped it wood. Otherwise, if you like to bathe with your baby, you will enjoy it. We found it better than any plastic tub. Even though we bought one plastic tub, one that folds down to be really compact, we never use it because she sometime clunks her head to the plastic sides, NOT REALLY SAFE UNLESS YOU WANT A REALLY UPSET CRYING BABY. So the safe bather is really better than any plastic tub, BUT sinks!"
4,WORTH EVERY PENNY,"I had received the fold-up tub as a shower gift and could only use it for about 4 weeks. After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to try this. It is wonderful. My daughter (10 weeks) just loves her tub time now and I can keep both hands free without having to worry about her head in the water. She feels alot more secure and enjoys kicking her feet and splashing with her hands. Even if you start off with a tub - I would definately purchase one of these also."
3,Great for bathing little ones in the sink,"I use this when I bathe my child in the kitchen sink. First, it's VERY soft, so it helps to prevent his head ""bumping"" into the sink edges. Because it is so soft, you can manipulate it to fit in the sink how you want it. (Be it more protection for the head as your child gets taller). Drying it is a breeze. Just hook it to your bathroom shower stall and let it drip dry! This also helps keep your baby warm while giving them a bath due to the fact that it's porous, and soaks up warm water to maintain the warmness of it all (as opposed to plastic baby bathers)"
4,functions well,the bath pad is fine - seems comfy for my little guy and keeps him elevated. but beware - do not hang it to dry until you squeeze out some of the water. i did not do this and the cloth that wraps around the hook ripped a bit. but it is fine to hang once some of the water is squeezed out.
1,Wouldn't buy again. Holds too much water.,It soaks up so much water and takes to long to dry. Not really what I was expecting or looking for. Still looking for that perfect baby bather.
2,Arrived Filthy and would not come clean.,I ordered this because I don't have a lot of storage space and thought this bath would be easier to store than a big plastic tub. It arrived sealed in plastic but when I attempted to use it for the first time black dirt seeped out. I have attempted to wash it 3 times through the washing machine and still get black dirt.
2,Not as expected,"I read this years ago and while I read it, and to this day, all I can recall are the two of them going back-and-forth about their relationship. To be fair, there is commentary about the campaign trail, but not as much as I would have liked (and what I thought the book would turn out to be). So, for me, I would have liked more about the campaign (especially since the book is rather long...or feels long, as if it was being dragged on)."
3,Cutesy On The Campaign Trail,"Carville and Matalin deserve credit for being scrupulously honest about the '92 campaign. Matalin especially is willing to fess up to her errors of judgment near the top of the Bush campaign, and bravely reveals what it's like to see a candidate you support and love see victory slip away. But the Carville/Matalin relationship is a bit too cute for politics, and the he said-she said back and forth of the book gets stale after the first couple hundred pages. With the exception of the personal looks inside the campaigns, there's little new here, and nothing that hasn't been covered better by other chroniclers of that strange election year. Matalin and Carville are both very good at what they do, but what they do is not professional writing, and neither is very good at it."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I was very disappointed in this book. The authors are very intelligent and astute, with a keen political sense, and they are excellent TV commentators. I expected them to clue us in on the inside politics of the presidential election and some of the dirty politics that went on. Instead, they rambled incoherently and in a disorganized fashion. I'll never read another political book again."
5,A Slightly Squishy Truck,"My husband saw this in a toybox at a friend's house during a party. They said their son loved it so we decided to buy one for our 2 year old who is obsessed with cars. He loves it. He even insists on taking it in the car instead of a regular ""stuffed"" toy. The best part is that it doesn't make any annoying sounds and it doesn't ""do"" anything. It only makes a soft ""engine running"" sound when you push the bumper. Just a nice, slightly squishy truck with big nubby tires. He loves to push this around and I don't have to worry that it will do serious damage to the furniture or to my son. It's not soft, it just has a little give and there aren't any hard corners. It's pretty big so it's easy for a 2 year old to bend over and push it without too much effort. In a house full of toys that beep, screech, and flash; I love this battery-free, fun and friendly little truck."
4,FUN,My grandson loves this little Pickup. You push the bumper and it sounds like a engine is running and it honks. It is made of a rubber-plastic durable material that is perfect for pre-schoolers and toddlers.
4,soft truck,"Was a great purchase, has good sound, cannot hurt the child or your furniture, could be a little easier for the child to make to sound, but overall I was very satified with how much my grandson had fun with it."
2,My baby hated it,My baby hated this toy he became very frustrated with it because when he would try and push it it would fall over can anyone recommend a better toy truck?
3,A photo book...but doesn't give you anything new.,"I bought this to complement the author's massive B-36 book thinking it would include photos that were cut from that book because of space.Sadly, it doesn't contribute much.Maybe I'm just spoiled by choice with not only Jacobsen's B-36 book, but by Jenkin's B-36 book ""Magnesium Overcast"" and itys accompaning ""B-36, A Photo Scrapbook.""If you have both of those books, there is no reason to buy this.Several of the photos have been greatly enlarged so their quality suffers. However, it does a few shots I've never seen before, so for $10, it's not a terrible deal.Again, it might be worth buying ifm you have Jacobsen's book (and the others) just so you can rest assured you have everything.A few more B-36 books, and my bookcase wil weigh as much as the plane itself."
3,Good product marginal documentation,"This is my first exposure to linux. I read good things about SUSE Linux. It was fairly easy to install, though a more user friendly manual would have made the installation trivial. Now I have a new OS that works fine but I have to buy another book to understand it. If you know Linux this may be a great product. If you don't, well, don't expect much help from the documentation."
2,does not work like others,"we've had other dibucaine's and this one does not work as well as the others, more like preph and others we do not like"
3,not the best,"it's really kinda greasy and can make a mess going on. it's also a bit difficult to remove all the way unless you get in the shower. it does do the job, pretty much pain wise, just kind of messy to use."
5,PITA Relief,Good stuff. Dibucaine Ointment relieved my PITA (caused by hemroids). I recommend it and will purchase it from Amazon. Was surprised Amazon carried medical products. The response in receiving the item was outstanding.
3,Anesthetic Ointment,"I wanted to try Dibucaine. I'd used it after the birth of my 1st child w/success. It was the same, but I realized that another product I'd been using, but had a hard x finding was actually much better. Sorry, didn't mean to be oblique. The product I use for this purpose is Dr. Sheffield's Hemorrhoid Ointment. I was disappointed that I couldn't find an Amazon source for it. I had to order a case through their rep:[...]Hope that clarifies the matter."
3,Replacement...,"Bought this in place of Nupercanial which is no longer available. Its works okay, but it is greasy! I wish Nupercanal was still available, it was the best!"
3,"Guilty pleasure, great spectacle, lousy DVD transfer","This movie is a guilty pleasure, best enjoyed in its original uncut, big screen Cinerama format.The story is corny, but the special effects make up for any deficencies. The Simitar DVD release is taken from a cut TV print running 102 min. The original theatrical roadshow Cinerama release ran aprox 136 min including intermission. The Simitar DVD is widescreen and muted stereo, but it is worn and terribly cut. Wait for a new transfer of the complete film from better source materials. Don't waste your money on Simitar junk."
4,Jules Verne inspired disaster film,"Anchor Bay has re-released this film in all it's 131 minute unedited glory (this is the copy with the hot air balloon on the cover). Some sources say this film originally ran 136 but that's counting the intermission. The DVD is terrific (no skips or jumps), widescreen, great sound and color. The unedited version helps the story along without question so take that in account when reading reviews that talk about muddled plotting in the shorter version. If you are into Jules Verne style films you'll like this one complete with volcanos, tidal waves, hot air balloons, deep sea exploration, late 19-century sailing ships, convicts, etc... Perhaps a little too much brought into the film and dispensed with quickly, but still nifty as far as the genre goes. Maxmillian Schell (the captain in the Jules Verne inspired THE BLACK HOLE) plays the captain, Diana Baker plays his love interest looking for her long lost child, Brian Keith plays an over-the-hill diver."
2,Yikes! What were they thinking?,"I immediately purchased this DVD title because it is the very first movie I remember watching at a theater as a very small child! The theater was the Cinerama Dome on Sunset Blvd. in 1969-1972 Hollywood, (they re-released it a few times, I saw it 5 times at that theater). This DVD simply put, is bad! Even on a big screen TV the picture is squashed, the sound is muffled, the theater experience is lost. The editing seems to have been done with scissors and tape. Entire scenes are missing, or cut very short. However, the best parts of the movie that I remember from when I was four years old are ok. The volcano eruption scenes, tidal wave, and really cool lava piercing the ship! That's the stuff you remember for a lifetime."
4,Entertaining disaster flic....,"if you don't take it too seriously! Mediocre acting, but pretty good special effects. The build up to the tidal wave sequence is quite effective and the wave scene doesn't disappoint. The unedited version does help to put the story together and it's now not so disjointed. Transfer is pretty good for its age and I'd recommend."
2,review of Krakatoa East of Java,"Obviously Krakatoa is West, not East of Java. The story is not very plausible but there are good scenes of the volcano erupting."
4,My Fantasy Adventure,Loved this rip-roaring adventure since I saw it in the theatre. Would loved to have had an adventure like this.
3,KRACKLIN KRAKATOA,"For a film made wayyyy back in 1969, KRAKATOA EAST OF JAVA has some pretty impressive effects, and it's a good thing, because the script itself is lame and rather dull. And as things went back in those days, we get some really bad songs including one sung by Barbara Werle in the film called ""I'm an Old Fashioned Girl."" It's embarrassingly bad. But the effects are what make this volcanic eruption worth watching. Remembering this was before CGI came around, the special effects crew does some fine work in assaying the damage that comes from the cataclysmic eruption. Oscar winner Maximilian Schell looks totally bored, and even Brian Keith as a doomed diver doesn't add much to the picture. Lovely Diane Baker (Journey to the Center of the Earth, Strait-Jacket) is entrancing as the lady of the hour. If you like those big budget disaster films of that time, you won't be disappointed in KRAKATOA."
2,Krakatoa East of Java -,"Krakatoa East of Java, is fine for what it is...an older movie. It wasn't exactly what I expected, but still somewhat entertaining. This DVD will more than likely sit on our shelf and collect dust, unlike others in our collection."
1,"krakatau,east of Java","well well well ! I was going to buy it but thanks to Amazon,there ARE reviews and I am not going to !"
1,Where's the plot?,"I had high expectations during the first 20 minutes or so of this movie, but the were all dashed. It starts out okay and it is interesting but as it goes on, you may find yourself wondering when the story is going to start. Unfortunatly it never does. I describe this movie as a mix of alot of people's stories all mixed up and unconnected. The volcanic explosions were great visually, but the wern't lead up to very well at all. It was kind of like, ""Okay, let's have an explosion."" with no suspence or anything. ALSO, the quality of the DVD is HORIBLE it jerks and the sound is off about a second at some times and it stoped for about 5 seconds at a time about every ten minutes. Very Annoying. Don't waste your money on this DVD."
2,Sound out of sync.,The editing is not smooth and at times the sound either leads or lags the video by up to two seconds. Very distracting. How can they butcher what I remember as a good movie and sell it in this condition. This is the 124 minute version.
4,Good Choice,"I got the movie as a gift for my mom, because it was something she had always remembered watching in her childhood. For the price I paid it was well worth it. It got here fast & was in mint condition. I wasn't too impressed with the film because of a few inaccuracies in nautical terminology, but other than that it wasn't too bad."
3,Fun formula treasure hunt movie,"Hanson (Maximilian Schell) is a smiling cordial captain. He greets the menagerie of passengers. Among which are balloonists, a deep sea diver, exotic female pearl divers, and a lady with a questionable background, a claustrophobic marine biologist, and a last minute pack of chained criminals.They are all going to Krakatau just before it blows its top. Most going for a part in a possible treasure. The captain and his girl Laura (Diane Baker) have ulterior motives. Is there really a treasure or a sham?Lots of scenery and quasi early science. It has the look and feel of all of old Jules Vern movies like ""Journey to the center of the earth.""The tsunami scenes may remind us of a more recent real tsunami.The only real draw back is the extended scenes. The movie over tells disasters by stretching them out for ever. You can get bored before songs are over. And they constantly point out the obvious over and over and over again."
5,Just as important...,As the rest of the add-ons & accessories. The bird singing button still works like new even after almost a year of daily play.I am more than pleased with all of the accessories & Dollhouse I bought here.Amazon.com prices & service are second to none!
3,Amusing,"A bizarre book of photographs chronicling the voyage of a red velvet sofa across the United States. It turns up in places you normally wouldn't expect to see a red velvet sofa - such as on a window washer's scaffold.Amusing the first few times you page through it but of limited repeat appeal. Appropriate to leave on the coffee table so your friends can ask ""What the hell is this?"""
4,A SUPERIOR BLUES CHAUNTESE,"A GREAT BLUES/TORCH SINGER. wHO LATER IN HER CAREER WOULD RECORD THE CLASSIC ALBUM ""sONGS WE TOUGHT YOUR MOTHER"" WITH ALBERTA HUNTER AND VICTORIA SPIVEY."
2,700 Club,"This book by CBN devotee Robertson examines how God has changed people in several case studies. CBN stands for Christian Broadcasting Newtwork. Roberston is an ordained Baptist minister. The 700 Club has been on air since the 1960s. I'm a 1,000 Club member, donating a grand a year. I thought it was a ho hum read. He ran for president in the 1980s, finishing twice second or third in the Republican primary."
4,Wow this cd has got style,"Celly Cel back again in 2005 with nice album. This tru West Coast Music which have got synthesizer bass sound and a lot of great gangsta rhymes, thise man is OG and he from Bay Area this is gangsta getto where black people shut each other and they are exploitation from white goverment in the USA.( Bloods & Crips and the other gangs wchich are situated in all Cali)But Celly Cel don't give up and try to make a good cd. The effect is great. Becouse he is from Sicc Wic Record and cooperate with great mc like Spice1 E-40 B-Legit C-bo, and great producers like Mike Moesly and Studio Ton. Effetc is great. If you are west coast fan oh no If you like good music with a lot of bass sound and gangsta lyrics this album is for you. This is good alternative to MTv"
2,A little...too small,"While I love the idea of making storyboard notebooks, I didn't find this notebook very practical. While it was very portable - it fit in my pants pockets - the book was just too small to write anything down. Forget considering drawing anything in the pages...1.not only are the boxes way too small and impractical for a filmmaker on the go, but2.the creases of the book binding are so hard to bend back that you really only get to write into part of the page.Good idea, but a little too impractical."
2,"Great Idea, Impractical Size","When I first heard about the Storyboard Moleskine I was excited. No longer would I have to draw out boxes to illustrate ideas that I had for various design projects (posters, webpages, book layout, etc.) then when on a trip I found one ina book store I got even more excited. That is until I opened the sample book they had. I was shocked to find out how small the cells to draw in were. Maybe if I worked with motion graphics of motion pictures it would be useful as I could draw stick figures. But for layouts with text and images it was utterly useless. This is problably the first item I have ever not liked that Moleskine has made. This would be a great resource for me if only it were in the larger size."
1,Ordered 2 - Received One,I ordered two of these books and only received one. The book is great! Too bad I only received one of them.
1,An interesting book - unless you want facts,"I waited months for this book to be released - wasn't worth the wait. I don't know about the plagiarism a previous reviewer referred to, but the book was a quickly written hack job with many inaccuracies. Example:Johnny Cash never sang ""The Ballard of Ira Hayes"". At first I thought it was a typo, but the error was repeated.The book says June Carter's first child came from her second marriage, to Rip Nixon. Must be a big surprise to Carlene Carter, June's daughter from her first marriage to Carl Smith.Mr. Campbell says: ""A bond of friendship was never to form between the two stars (Cash and Waylon Jennings)"". That comment is so stupid it's not even worth discussing.The name is Ferlin HUSKY, not Huskie.Was it really necessary, when mentioning money, to give the equivalent in English pounds?"
5,Track Listing Information,1) Voulez-Vous Danser (3:17)2) All That She Wants (3:30)3) Münchhausen (Just Chaos) (3:27)4) Happy Nation (4:11)5) Waiting For Magic (5:17)6) Fashion Party (4:10)7) Wheel Of Fortune (3:52)8) Dancer In A Daydream (3:37)9) My Mind (Mindless Mix) (4:09)10) Wheel Of Fortune (Original Club Mix) (3:58)11) Dimension Of Depth (1:45)12) Young And Proud (3:54)13) All That She Wants (Banghra Version) (4:14)
5,Great Product,"Ordered this to replace the power adapter on my Wife's Toshiba laptop that died. I chose Antec because of it's reputation in power supplies and I wasn't disappointed. It is a quality product with plenty of interchangeable tips and a variable voltage switch on the adapter to select the voltage your laptop requires. It is set to the lowest available voltage from the factory which is great because if you're like me and just plug it in without reading the instructions, it won't damage your laptop. I'd definitely recommend this power supply if it is compatible with your laptop. It's a great balance between value and quality."
4,its OK!,Not sure if works yet! It really does not taste bad. Had some good days but cannot tell if it is related to this
4,Seems to help,I take the recommended doses daily and I have been taking it forabout a month and it seems to be helping. I have to experimentwith it to get the dosing I need for better results.
5,The Best Album I've Ever Had,"I am 66 years old and I can truthfully say that this Album is one of my all time favorites. I have gone thru 3 records and still continue to like it. I now have a CD player and want to order it as well as another of his CD's. My daughter took me to a small club in Houston,Tex.to see this young artist she was wild about. I can say that""He blew me away"".His voice, and guitar playing are among the best I have heard and I am""Hard to please"".Of all his albums,(and I want all of them now on CD),""Alive on Arrival"" is my all time favorite. I am listening to it right now.Steve Forbert deserves more recognition that he has gotten!"
5,excellent,"I have now purchased this album three times (the first vinyl I owned was a gift purchased in a second-hand shop)- I love it, but can't seem to keep hold of it."
5,1st is as good as his best!,"I have enjoyed Jackrabbitt Slim for years, now, but I never heard this, his 1st album. It is as good as JS which I think is one of the best, period. You can compare him to people like Springsteen or Dylan, but he's got his own unique style of writing and perfoming. And it was under $10 at Amazon!"
4,george clinton is proud of his clones,"offshoot of the p funk these are members of the p funk who decided to make a cd on their spare time gc does a guest on a track while the majority of this album features sativa diva which is george's granddaughter and the lovely kendra foster, rico lewis who is george's grandson, belita woods, citrus, and kim manning don't expect the usual p funk madness on here COP leans towards a more gangster rap vibe here not a bad indie release I'm a big p funk fan if you're one also and have to have ebvery p funk project I'd cop this but I advise that you be open minded and be a serious raphead to enjoy this cauisde you know sativa diva talk about getting high but then again what else can you expect from p funk."
1,Poor-Funk,"Uninspired and poorly produced, this is sort-of-P-funk noodling of the worst kind. Yes, George C. appears here on a couple of tracks, as well as a few other P-funk members or related (Shock G of Digital Underground) but to little effect: the songs sounds unfinished, more like demos (and not enticing ones) than material ripe for sale. A shame. The ""Children of productions"" remake is very poor-sounding indeed, with the harmonic changes unmanaged by the band. Too bad for this great P-Funk track, which deserved a better treatment. Those guys need to raise their chops levels BIG TIME. Sad for GC, a genius in bad company."
1,"""I think it's a bear?""","A few unamazing camera tricks aside, there wasn't much about this movie worth boasting. The story meandered, the sound guy should have been fired, the furry BIGfoot costumes were unconvincing, the slice and dice editing was unimaginative...... This is a movie that would have had an uphill battle just to place as average. That it doesn't make that distinction is obvious at the outset. The story was ""borrowed"" from a b-zillion other movies of its ilk: get a group of kids in a cabin and start disposing of them. The trouble is the `action' is late in coming, leaving us with a few unrelated scenes of killings early on. By the time the BIGfoot (feets?) start showing up it's rather late in the game to care one way or the other. The men are killed, the women abducted and inducted into the pact (herd?), whatever.I've seen better, a lot better, this was no keeper. (I'm amazed that I made it through to the bitter end.)"
1,A major disgrace to the original bogg creek(s),"I was seriously disappointed in this movie.It doesn't even deserve the title ""Boggy Creek""!!!Folks,don't waste your money or your time with this one."
2,Boggy Creek Disappoints,"I'm a bit of a bigfoot enthusiast...so it isn't difficult to capture my interest...but this film borrows it's title from a relatively interesting film; ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" (Arkansas)...uses Big Boggy Creek (Texas) as it's setting and provides a thoroughly stilted, boring story of killer sasquatch mating with human females. Poorly acted...poorly filmed and provides little background information or realistic response from local law enforcement regarding multiple homicides. I'd give this a Bigfoots Thumb Down!"
1,Sucked,Nothing like the old one. Don't watch it!!!!! Nothing like the old one. Don't watch it!!!!! Nothing like the old one. Don't watch it!!!!! Nothing like the old one. Don't watch it!!!!! Nothing like the old one. Don't watch it!!!!!
1,worse movie ever......,It's not even worth one star... One of the worse movies ever.. I bought it because I thought it would be like the first Boggy Creek. but this was a waste of money. It has some ugly talking. Everyone gets killed that is staying in the cabins. At the end the woods are full of creatures..Believe me choose something else to spend your money on..
1,Charles Pierce must be rolling..,"As a horror buff and a fan of the Bigfoot movies..I found this underwhelming and detached from the original film (this film claims no affiliation with the prior BC films). Filmed in Uncertain, Tx it has a great location since that area is known for many sightings and folklore. Since most Bigfoot movies are campy at best this one falls both short of comedic and horror value.Eduardo Sanchez (Blair Witch fame) has a new new Bigfoot movie titled EXIST which is backed by a major studio and for once the creatures suit will be done properly and played more for legit scares than comedic value. Until then stay far away from this release as possible..horrid at best..**Do yourself a favor and purchase the awesome new book from Lyle Blackburn titled ""The Beast Of Boggy Creek"" which focuses on the creature from Fouke, Arkansas..**"
3,it was alright,it was an ok movie it keeps you entertained throughout but the plot is a little weak its a movie you watch once or maybe if your bored and there's nothing else to watch
4,Wonderful Pop-Rock!,"Ben Taylor's style comes across as a pleasurable mix of pop-rock in the tradition of the 1970's. The pleasant surprise is that it has a 21st century appeal! A MUST for ""baby-boomers"" looking for new material and their children who want something better than their parents' nostalgia!"
5,Sounds Great!,Saw Ben and his dad JT in concert and loved his voice. A nice combination between JT and Ben's momCarly Simon. Very relaxing and easy to listen to. It's a favorite for me in my car to cruise downthe road to. The CD was used but was delivered in great shape and worked perfectly. Packaging waseven barely used. Had inside info included also.
2,Another Run around the Sun Ben Taylor,"I loved Ben singing "" I Will"", sounded so much like Dad, I thought how could I not like a whole CD by him? Well I was very disappointed, he has a lovely voice but I didn't click with any song on his CD. Don't know if it's just his choice of songs or if it was my 35 year old addiction to James Taylor that clouded my vision, expecting to see what his father has. I bought Sally's CD also, hers was a little better, but not nearly as great as I thought she would be after listening to her sing on her Mom's CD. I love that whole talented family but I wasn't thrilled with this CD, sorry Ben!"
3,3 and a half (c+),"Definitely inapired by the sound of his much more famous father, Taylor, gives a very nicely produced effort. Guitar sounds great as does really beautiful vocals. Honestly, songs are not half bad, however, he falls into the same trap as his Dad and everything starts to sound the same. Realy, though, he gives a lot of nice pleasant songs. lyrically thouhg, the words are awful and do not even make sense: ""One man day rolling in high and grey..I'll keep my time"".I mean he really could have put more effort into the lyrics. i would still recommend this though."
4,OK for a few bucks,"Good Loupes cost money like anything else, but for a few bucks this really isn't too bad. Black or dark loupes are always better, but this was for a specific purpose."
1,sucks,"waste of money. it isn't a 30x loop. I bought it trying to read the serial number on my fiance's diamond ring. 20x's at the jewelers can read that yet this ""30x"" can't POS."
2,"NO eye relief,","Hello,The eye relief is very poor you have to put the loupe right on object thus you cant see very much. The doublets are better and for 4 bucks for two, or 2.50 for one including shipping it is a much better deal. Don't waste your time with this one get doubles much better eye relief, ands less than half the price."
4,getting a better look,30+ is great magnification--it gets the job donewish they made a hands free glass that didn't cost a fortune
4,Does the job,"The product is exactly as it looks. The words ""Triplet"" & 30X all came off after the first cleaning. Still works fine. It does take some getting used to to get the correct focus, but for looking at plant material it does great. Much better than those tube microscopes when your in the field. A 10X and 20X would also be useful."
3,Looks like a 10x loupe.,Looks like a little higher than 10x but definitely not 30x. My 20x magnifies more. Overall quality is very good.
4,Not 30x mag,I can't tell if this is 30x or 10x. It's very well made with real leather case. I would recommend this item.
2,Not Up To Par,"I was not happy with it. It was not what I expected, and the quality was shoddy. The description was sketchy, and I should have paid closer attention to the few details there were. I considered returning it, but figured it would be more trouble than it would be worth. However, I probably will not order from these people again."
5,"Wonderful, Ill buy 10 more!",These work wonderful because they are both functional and beautiful. Imagine stuffing away all those unsightly papers but still being able to leave the boxes out for display on a bookshelf and not having to hide them too!
4,no surprises,the boxes are a lil smaller than I expected but they do the job and stack nicely on the book case to hide clutter/ store photos/ momentos. Bought these for my hubby's stuff. He picked the color. He used em without complaining. Its a win.
5,The best live performance ever!,"This live performance was recorded in Munich 1988. Bonisolli is in very good shape and his ringing high notes are really amazing! He can manage the liric role such as Nadir or Rodolfo as well as the dramatic roles such as Manrico or Pollione. As an encore,he offers a fine ""O sole mio"" with warm timbre and effortless high tessitura."
4,Wonderful Tenor!!,"I love this album! But wanted to add to the previous reviewer's comment that Mr. Bonisolli ""recently disappeared"". Mr. Bonisolli died in October, 2003, a few hours after the MAGNIFICENT tenor, Franco Corelli, died. Our loss, heaven's gain..."
5,Extraordinary display of talent...,"This is a extraordinary document of one of the best tenors ever...i strongly recommend this album. Recorded live in a recital, Bonisolli sings very well known arias, but it doesn't matter if you already know them by memory, because his singing is superb, and gives a new and fresh perspective on each scene. My favourites here are Norma, Luisa Miller and Trovatore (Actually, i downloaded 5 tracks from this album in iTunes).The quality of the recording is first rate, and the applauses don't bother at all. Give a try to this gigantic tenor, recently dissapeared."
2,A Mafia mish mash of a movie...,"This film contains every Mafia/Italian American stereotypical cliche in the book. In an hour and forty minutes you get elements of the ""Sopranos"", ""Goodfellows"", and ""The Godfather"" all rolled into one low budget movie. I was amused at how far the producers were willing to go with this! Hence the two star rating..."
3,Mafioso...,"This movie was ok, not a high budget flick.It stays in the tradition of the MAFIA genre.Not a ""GODFATHER"" or ""GOODFELLAS"".I rate this DVD a 3 of 5 stars!!"
3,Pretty much run of the mill,"I expected far more substantial explanation and real-world advice. What I got was a collection of anecdotes that yielded more common sense conclusions than expert insight.And as a parent raising bilingual, bi-racial, bi-cultural children, I really disagree with restricting the native speaking parent to their own language. To create a family bond in all directions, IMO, it has worked best for both parents to model both languages, with emphasis (of course) at home on the language not experienced in everyday life. Our child quickly-- by age two-- could easily distinguish between the two and perform his own translations when prompted."
2,"badly organized, dissapointing","As an expectant mother of bi-cultural, bi-racial, and hopefuly bi-lingual child, I am reading any kind of books which might help me. On the contrary to many praises, this book was a big dissapointment for me. The authors keep repeating the same thing chapter after chapter, and failed to give any concrete evidence to explain why. If you just want to read many bits and pieces opinions from bilingual children's parents, this may be the right book for you. I rather recommend ""The Bilingual Family."""
3,good but not brilliant,"The trouble is that the sounds are so been here done that it becomes harder and harder to surprise anyone.The ""deepness"" implied by the title sounds like an excuse to put out those endless summery going nowhere don't have a tune ""grooves""house is now synonomous with.This is not a bad C.D.by any means it is something that I would buy if I had no other house music . Much better is Kevin Yosts' outstanding Small Town Underground which any one with ears should own. .Avoid anything with Ibizia in the title anyway and get hold of his Road less traveled on Distance which really does the business.My goodness i'm over house."
5,Perfect!,"Simply the best introduction there is to Kant's third critique. As a guide, it makes reading Kant so much more rewarding. Too bad it's out of print. I got my copy from a library."
5,Typical Paolini excellence,I love this book. I bought it for my kids to give me for Mother's Day. I'm a handspinner and just love this story about Charlie the shepherd who needs a new cloak. He goes through all the steps from shearing his sheep to sewing the finished fabric together into a new cloak. It has great humor and is a fun read.
5,Until the next time,"I am very pleased with this CD and I get so much enjoyment listening to it. I would recommend it to anybody thinking about, or wondering if itis worth buying."
3,Beautiful pictures - not as much detail,"There are party themes presented in the book with beautiful photography and some amount of detail, but for my 6 year old's birthday party I was hoping for more specific information on games, food, goodie bag ideas, etc. There were some good website references, but in general it seemed like the content was at a more generic level than I hoped for."
3,Great place to start,"If you are looking for a book with great pictures to fuel your party fire then this book is for you. As a children's event planner and entertainer I am always looking for fresh ideas. Filled with great pictures about colorful themes, this book shook up my hum drum party ideas and gave rise to a few others. It lacks a little in the details department. I would say it's a great place to start but if you are needing specific guidance, others may be the one for you."
3,pretty good film,the pacing of this film at first was kinda slow&then it picks up.I gotta give Scott Baio much Props for bringing it in this film.He truly did a good job in this film.the film reminds me of a few films that are mixed as one here.the sentiments are felt&This Film ends really strongly.I wish the Film had have been more Consistant from the start.but it's a Pretty Good film.
2,Low production quality,"The low production quality (camera work, sound quality, editing) was distracting. The story was full of stereotypes, exaggerations and inconsistencies. I wouldn't recommend unless you have a lot of time on your hands and you like saccharin sweet romances."
3,The movie was not so bella!,It was an alright movie. It was very sad. I was hoping for a better Scott Baio character.
3,"Simple and sweet ... nothing more, nothing less","I have to admit I am surprised at the 5 star ratings for this film. Despite the fact it went straight to video in Australia, ""A Wedding for Bella"" satisfies if you are after a straight-forward storyline with no complexities involved. This type of storyline has been done before, so there is nothing groundbreaking here.A simple and sweet film ... and I can see why it skipped the cinemas."
5,I LOVED This Movie!,"Okay, so it ain't ""Gone with the Wind"", but what it is is a sweet, sad, funny, romantic, warm-hearted movie. The characters were entertaining, the plot was interesting, and Scott Baio proves that he is really a pretty darn good actor. I got a kick out of the older couple who play the Italian parents as they remind me of my own Greek relatives. Other reviewers are complaining saying that the Italian elders are a mere caricature of real people. Let me tell you, coming from an ethnic family...they are not too far off the mark. One would have to grow up like the Greeks or Italians to truly appreciate and embrace all the nuances presented in this film. I highly recommend ""A Wedding for Bella"". I bought the DVD on the sales rack of a video store on a whim, and I am so glad I did. I can't wait to share it with my brothers."
4,sweet improbable romantic story,"if i may. who knew scott baio was such a good actor? he did a great job here. the rest were good too. his bride to be is beautiful and was cast perfectly. while the storyline was not always quite realistic, i truly enjoyed this movie. some parts of it were very realistic and the movie had a point or two. not the best but pretty good. this was not dumb or hackneyed i would recommend it."
3,The holodeck malfunctions...once again,"Alexander drags Worf to the holodeck to the Wild West and Troi shows up as the ""mysterious stranger"" (I'm really not into the whole Worf/Troi thing). At the same time, Geordi is running a scan on Data and the two merge- resulting in Wild Westerisms in Data and too many Datas in the holodeck. Several cute and funny lines and good sets, but overall not one of my favorites."
3,Good,"Good had it bout 1 month with the Titan T12 550 motor, then i ran a 7.4 5000 lipo 3 time and blew motor. Now i got a Traxxas Rustler VXL with the Brushless Velinion motor and speed control and love it with no problems! It runs bout 70mph and the Rustler runs bout 40mph! I love both my cars bt dont run a Lipo over a 3000 in the Rustler with the Titan T12 550! It will tear it up quick!haha"
3,rustler=ok,"This truck is my first R/C. Let's just say that I was mildly upset that it doesn't get as fast as I would like. But it is fairly fast for a brushed. I am thinking about upgrading to an 8cell battery. The charger they give is junk! It takes 6 hours to charge for only 10-15 minutes of run time. I would recomend getting the RPM Wide Front Bumper. And the RPM A-Arms. Pretty fast,and jumps well,but the shock oil is crazy thin. Overall a decent truck, great for beginers. The training mode really helps for starting out."
4,rip off,the truck they are selling is only worth 209.99 the rustler vxl sells for 339.99 Im at the hobby shop alot . Me and my two sons love our trucks they are great fun .
1,traxxas rustler,I got one for christmas and it is one of the worst cars i have had I have went through two motors the last one i got and ran it twice and it would not work so I called traxxas and they sent me a new one and they didn't say sorry or anything they acted like they didn't even care. they don't even want to make there costumers happy I will not ever buy another traxxas product again just becouse of the rustler and there support when i called them. and the car is not all that great the battery charger takes eight hours to charge which is terrable because poeple don't want to wait eight hours to play with the car. they make the car out of very cheap materials and they want you to have to buy a faster charger becouse they know that most people are going to buy a faster charger.
1,Don't even think about it,"...There appears to be information scattered about, but finding it is next to impossible. They seem to be very proud of the ability to build formulas anywhere in a window you want, but so what? They barely even tell you how to do that, and very poorly. There are no cogent lessons. You go looking for lessons and all you find is help files on how to use the software that tell you nothing but what great software it is. I thought Encore's ""Math Advantage"" was [bad], but I can't even think of expletives appropriate to what a waste of money this was. Unbelievable that after so many years of software development companies are still producing useless bits like this."
3,Like anime like manga...,"Good artwork and a simple plot but with a slightly interesting, if twisted, ending. Sequel to the events of the anime, decades later, Saya is once again hunting down vampires - Chiropterans stalking teenagers. Will she be able to wipe them out or are they waiting for her?"
2,Sequal in only a sense,"Ok, This is supposedly the sequel to the stunning hit anime. Unlike the movie, this book was terrible. I remember nothing in the origional anime about lesbians, yet that is the main theme for the novel. Ther is also some plot that is totally confusing, but I attribute that to a terrible english translation. Instead of buying this, get a good graphic novel instead, or just watch the anime again."
1,Not a shadow on the Anime,The plot was shallow and course. The artwork was uninspired and pornographic rather than erotic. It was an insult to a brilliant character developed in a masterful anime.
1,I Rather Write,I rather write than recommend this book to anyone. I could not believe how disappointed I was in this series. I can see how some may get their rocks off on this manga but it really sucked. I will stick to novels and so should you.
2,Not for Linux,"I installed this card in an Ubuntu 8.04 desktop system. Runs fine using skge driver EXCEPT no 1000 Gbs operation, only 100 Mbs or lower. Earlier revisions of this card are said to run better, but you can't tell which revision you are buying until you buy it.Update: While above may have been true (skge vs 1000 bps), an Intel PRO/1000 card also failed to sync at 1000 bps until I upgraded my cables to Cat 5e. RTFM, again!"
4,Simply reliable and easy to install,"If you've seen NICs (Network Interface Card) before, this is pretty much the standard for gigabit speed. I find D-Link to be one of the most reliable products around and so far, I haven't seen a single problem with the product, very reliable and I highly recommend."
2,Do not get this if you're running Linux,"Works fine on Windows XP, but does not work well with Linux. I've been using Linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time, and still had issues getting this card to run under Linux. My built in 10/100 NIC was much faster than this card would go. Ended up getting an Intel gigabit card that, of course, works with no issues. Save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a Linux box."
1,"Did not work on my system. Win 7 64-Bit, 4GB Ram","This card ruined my night. I spent a ton of time trying to figure out why it wouldn't resolve an IP address. I have a DHCP router, so I typically let it assign out the IPs, but when that wouldn't work, I tired assigning it manually. It still would not take an IP. The router saw it briefly, on the Client Table, and recognised it as an Ethernet connection, but it still would not work. I had to restore my system back to before I tried installing he card to even be able to use the on board card I was replacing. I believe the issue has to be on the driver. I read a lot of posts about this, and even went searshing for a phantom Marvell driver that some said worked. It looked like a great card for the price, but unfortunately it didn't work for me. I have my box ready to go back to Amazon.I recieved it quickly, and was packaged well. As always, Amazon does a good job on shipping and packing."
2,Wil eventually work,"Have yet to actually see this work yet. I have had issues with the computer I bought this for, so it hasn't worked yet. I installed it on my new computer, and it ""shows"" that it's working, but no through-put yet. Reinstalled the old D-link 10/100 and it works fine. Have not had a lot of time to work it through yet, but I'm sure it will. Troubleshooting guide on the disk will most definitely help much more than the ""online help menu"", since this gadget really needs to be working to get you to the ""online help menu to start with."
4,Good Inexpensive Monitors,"I've had these for a couple months now and I can't really complain. The volume is slightly limited but the range is nice and I feel like they do give you an accurate feel for the sound mix. Seeing as they are some of the most inexpensive monitors available I expected less and was impressed.It seems like most of the reviewers here are using them as speakers, which I personally think is a waste. If you are just looking to find good speakers to watch movies and listen to music on your computer you'd probably be much better off looking for a good set of computer speakers, which will cost the same if not less. I mean at that point your definately not going to be taking advantage of the 1/4 inch inputs and that's one of the reason that these cost more than computer speakers."
5,Geology book review,"Oil and Gas in the Mid-Continent Fields (Purchased on 08/16/2009) by Luther C. Snider is a good, useful book for those interested in mid-continent geology.Has interesting geological models and information."
2,Harmony 1000,"Locks up consistently. If any of your devices were turned on by their own remotes, the Harmony doesn't react very well. Loud high pitch sound, when put on charger. Wondering if anyone else experiences this?"
1,I hate this remote!,"I've owned this remote for a few years now. Why I haven't replaced it yet is beyond me. The software is iffy at best, the touch screen is not reliable and the onscreen buttons are too small. You press a button and sometimes the action occures right away and sometimes it takes 15-20 seconds. If you think maybe you didnt hit the button you hit it again and the next thing you know you're cycling through 3-4 button pushes. The programmed actions work sometimes and other times it only executes one or two of the three of four actions you programmed. Sometimes it locks up entirely and you have to take the battery out and reset it. Junk. I hate this remote. I need a new remote."
4,Easy set up but need two hands to operate,"Like all Harmony remotes, the 1000 is simple to set up for any configuration of AV components and controlls them all with ease. If you're fussy about how the screen appears and the order and arrangement of everything, you may need to reprogram several times to get it ""just right"", but that's equally easy.The only downside is actual operation once set up. Because of the shape and size of the 1000, you need two hands to operate it. Unless you really think the color touch screen is a benifit, other models do the same thing, are easier to hold and will save you some hard earned bucks."
2,Should be better for the money,"Very limited programming. If the macro is ""turn on TV and home theater sound system"" you would think that it would allow you to mute the TV right? No option for that. Also the volume ""down"" sometimes sticks and keeps sending that signal until you hit volume up again. Lastly the most annoying is the unit freezes. The only fix is removing the battery to force a reboot. Bottom line looks cool but keep your old remotes handy."
4,harmony 1000 remote,"To keep it short an sweet, it was fast, on time, an about 80% cheaper from beach camera.com. Good product. Good service"
3,Harmony 1000,"This was the 2nd Harmony 1000 I purchased, both units are easy to use and program, customer support is excellent. My first unit, purchased May 2007, would lockup after being left on the charge over night(or Less)and you would have to remove the Battery and reinstall it, the unit then reboots. I contact customer support and they new of the problem (firmware) and would have a fix in Early 08. Before buying my second unit I contact Harmony and they assured me that the lockup problem was fixed. The second unit seem to be ok but after about a week the second unit locked up and I contacted customer support(CS) and they made a change in the firmware. That seems to have solved the problem, however the unit sometimes does not turn on my sat TV unit - CS thinks it a memory problem and is send me a new unit for free. Operationally the unit is excellent and easy to use."
2,Problematic,"Very difficult to get to work properly, many emails and tech supports later, waited two weeks and got new one from factory only to find it unsatisfactory as well. Returning for credit."
1,Warranty Expired and so did several remotes--Logitech NO HELP AT ALL,"I, and two clients whom I have directed to this remote, all had unit failures very soon after the warranty expired. Logitech would not not help, even after acknowledging that at least one unit was defective. They lack integrity, and clearly this product is not built to last. Save yourself the money and the headache and go elsewhere."
1,Stay Away,"I have had this remote for three months now. It runs very slow and often requires reboots because the software is junk. Go buy anything else, especially if you want something that will actually control z-wave lighting systems because this won't do it even though they advertised it to do so."
1,AWFUL product and customer servivce !,- 9 out of 10 times the remote does not operate the devices properly- I had the remote replace twice and still does not work- Also screen of the first remote went dead after few months. Screen of the second remote does not register the commands- Logitech customer service is a NIGHTMARE! You spend at least a hour each time with young clueless folks who keeps forward your call to somebody.- Also Logitech does not have the full codes of all brands and devices in their database so it creates conflicts with commands.Product is as bad as customer service.
1,"No Harmony, just frustration","I have tried numerous times to get this remote working properly, contacting customer service, installing and reinstalling the software to no avail. After my last contact with Logitech, I was informed there was a software glitch and I should be patient while they rectify the issue. My advice is to save your hard earned money and buy a less expensive product."
5,best remote ever,"Purchased harmony 1000 from amazon and not only got a great price, local store was asking 499, but the ease of programming and use is tops."
1,Software set up problems,"Without a doubt, this is the worst electronics product I have ever owned in terms of my being able to set it up. The software is HORRIBLE. Most of the problems are connected with downloading the firmware from the Logitech website. For some reason, I get various messages indicating the device is not connected, when in fact it is. After finally getting it to work, after about 2 weeks it froze up. I restarted it, and now I am going through the same problems all over again, except the action that finally fixed it before won't work now. The instructions are sadly lacking too. I would not recommend this product.If you must have one, I would also recommend staying away from the touch screen. You don't realise how much you rely on tactile buttons. Having to look at the touch screen for each command is harder, and you really wish you had a stylus to give commands."
1,MONEY STARRING BACK AT ME,"WE BOUGHT THIS ALONG TIME AGO DOESN'T DO JACK, YOU LOAD IT UP IT FREEZES, IT'S LINE OF SITE......THIS THING BLOWS...I HEARD THERES A RECALL/LAWSUIT PLEASE HELP SOMEONE STEER US IN RIGHT DIRECTION.....IM A DISABLED MARINE MY GIRLFRIEND BOUGHT SO I COULD USE TV......NOT HAPPENING.ONLY THING ITS GOOD FOR IS $300.00 TABLE ORNAMENT, WHICH WITH MY PENSION I CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THIS MONEY...HOW CAN I GET NEW ONE AND RETURN THIS ONE....IM IN A WHEELCHAIR AND DONT HAVE TIME TO WASTE MONEY OR SIT HERE AND TYPE THIS OUT WITH A PENCIL....LOGITECH SEND 1100 PLEASE!!!!!"
2,Not really for market,Logitech has a lot more work to do on the software of this product before it is put on the shelf for consumers. It does not fuction as it is said to.
3,Old wine in a new bottle..,"I used it for a week and returned it. It is no different from 880 remote except for looks. As outlined by other reviewer, Like other universal remotes, it doesnt have any feedback built in to know if a command was ever recvd and processed.Price tag is too steep.Not worth the price."
1,Logitech Harmony 1000 Advanced Universal Remote,I had to return this item. It's impossible to use. It took hours to program all the variuos remotes to this unit. Each different remote must be programmed by each remote key. Each screen only holds 9 buttons and you can't program 0-9 on one screen. So when you want to see a channel that has 3 numbers and one of them is 9 you can't enter all 3 numbers before the remote goes back to the home sceen. Also when you push a button it is so sensitive that it enters your cammand twice.
1,No User Support,"I have had this remote control for a little over a month now and it has never consistently worked properly. It would not switch to the correct inputs and it would give a low battery error even though it was charged overnight. My e-mails to Logitech support were never acknowledged and considering the cost of this thing, I expected a lot more from them. When I finally got a hold of someone on the phone, they ""found a problem"" with my account that apparently explained why I never got an e-mail back from them. The support person I spoke to on the phone was helpful though and the remote seemed to be working afterwards. Two days later, it wasn't. Again, no answer to my e-mail.I have found it easier to go back to multiple remotes than to experience the frustration I have with trying to get this over-priced piece of hardware to work.To those of you who decide to buy it, I wish you better luck than I have had."
2,nice looking [...],I have had this remote for about a year and a half and have used it only sparingly. It's big bright andbeautiful. It however is way over priced and difficult to navigate. Because it is primarily touch screen driven one will often touch the wrong area and launch an activity or function that you didn't want to occur. My screen has gone dead. The battery contact is broken and the 499 dolloar remote is kaput.I do have two other remotes from logitech that I love. The harmony One is the best hands down. The 880 is a good workhorse. I know the price on the 1000 model has dropped significantly but there is a reason for this. Save yourself a big headache and get the Model One instead. It got a five star rating in Macworld Magazine. The Giz Wiz also loved it.
2,Not Worth it,"Like a lot of reviewers have stated - the unit looks great out of the box, but it never really was able to replace the original remotes. If you look at your cable or audio receiver remote, there are a number of buttons/functions that need to be pushed to fully control the unit. So how can a flat touch screen replace all of those separate buttons on all of the remotes. Well...it can't. At least not well.I like Logitech products - I find them well built and functional. This one just doesn't hit the mark."
1,Worst remote EVER.,"The problem for me was the battery life. The large display sucks thethe battery to nothing in no time. It wasn't long before the remotesbattery would not recharge. Finding a replacement battery wasimpossible, (including contacting Harmony directly).Through in trash."
1,Crummy Remote- Product is Not Worth Hassle and Money,"I have had this remote in remote for almost 2 years now. I would not recommend it. It is hard to program, requires new firmware all the time & is starting to simply breaking down with age.My problems:1. System randomly restarts for no reason. I can be holding the remote and watching a show when the remote just reboots. When this happens is shuts down everything. Whole reboot means ~2 minutes of waiting. Tech looked and figured it was some loose something inside.2. A chronically sticking volume button. It cannot be fixed. Had a local tech inspect my unit and he said this was not due to ""sticky fingers"" but a cheap mechanical that could not be fixed as there are no repair parts.3. Logitech Support is laughable. Good luck trying to call them and get help."
2,"Good functionality, some getting used to, but poor quality","As an update for those of you considering this model (assuming it's being clearanced by some retailers) or the newer one, I want to warn you that my 1000 died after about 16 months. Which is of course, convenient, given the 12 month warranty period. All-in-all it was a good remote while it lasted, though casual users will be confused at first given the lack of physical buttons. Once you're used to it though, the touchscreen is great. I just feel that for an MSRP of 500 it should have lasted a bit longer... Ah well. Customer support is helpful, and the product does what's advertised. Now if only I could find a way to lease one for a year..."
1,"Not fully functioning RF Capability, Marketing was misleading",I bought the remote for easy control of TV components in a hidden cabinet along with control of some home automation lighting control. The short story is that I went in circles being mislead by Logitech tech support for about 5 hours of my time (total). It wasn't until I asked for an answer in writing that I got the truth and the truth is that the 1000 is not fully compatible with the RF extender. It will not support home automation unless it is IR (though there are a few home automation IR products almost all of them are RF). I ended up returning this and getting the 890. The 890 with the RF extender was about $200 less expensive and even if the 1000 had the z-wave capability after using both I like the 890 better anyway.
2,UGH!,"I used to think that I was decently handy with electronic gadgets until I received this as a present. However,despite hours of tinkering, I can never seem to get it to cooperate. While this remote sounds very good in theory it appears to fall rather short in practice."
4,Good if you want to be a show off.,"It works good. The software is pretty easy to use. It supports just about any piece of equipment that you have. I don't think it will work with a Playstation 3, but you'd have to double check that. But it's really for showing off. With my normal remote I can sit back, and mindlessly click through the channels, just by feeling for the buttons. This is kind of clunky and you almost need 2 hands to use it. It's truly a ""look at me and my expensive remote"" kind of thing.I used it for a few months, had my fun, showed it off to everyone, now I'm ready to move on. I might actually sell it, anyone want to buy it?"
2,This is a great idea poorly executed.,"The 'touch screen' is like touching an LCD monitor, in everyway. You don't really just touch, you push. And by push, I mean as hard as you would a button. Kinda fizzles that feature. Moving on.When you choose an 'activity'(Watch TV, Watch DVD, Play Xbox, etc), it is supposed to turn on/off all components involved in that activity. This process simply recognizes the last setting you made on it and adjusts from there. Great, right? Wrong. If anything is done manually, you have to go through all your HDMI inputs, AV inputs, side audio, etc. to get this paper weight back in 'sync'.I find myself using the remotes that comes with it constantly.Bottom line: Looks cool, ...I got nothin'"
3,Great But Needs Fine Tuning,"I love this remote when it works. Has tendency to freeze up requiring removing & reinserting battery. Also, there are times not all components start up or shut down simultenously requiring additional steps. Customer service did not make me confident that the software upgrade they said would be available for a dwonload in the near future would correct these problems. But when it is working perfectly, whioh is 75% of the time, it is easy, intuitive and impressive."
4,very well made and a good unit.,Harmony 1000 is a very easy to program and a very well built unit. It works well IF one has many components and it takes time to get used to the touch screen. I will advise the buyer to play with the unit before ordering as many people may not like the touch screen if they are used to the regular remotes.I am very happy with the unit.
1,Interface and setup problems,"Spent 6 hours working with 8 people at tech support (both Tier 1 and 2) only to find out that the 1000 has interface problems with a Linksys router in a home system. Could only get to 95% of complete setup. When the 1000 went to upload information the last time to the Harmony servers, the unit would freeze up and not complete the process. The 880 supposedly does not have this problem but after 6 hours and no offer of a discount to purchase an 880 I am returning the 1000 until they get the problem resolved. After reading other reviews, the unit seems to have other problems. I would not recommend it."
3,Beautiful - complex - somewhat inconvenient,"Beautiful to hold and to view.Simple to set up about 80% of the equipment. I ran into a snag when I tried to add a very old remote to my setup - it just doesn't work, even when I ""teach"" the harmony the codes.The documentation is sparse, requiring one to go to the Logitech website for help. The setup software is not transparent to use - it requires one to think like the programmer, rather than user-friendly.To save battery, the remote turns off quickly - too quickly if you are fast-forwarding through a commercial. During fast forward, the remote deactivates, one has to lift the unit to re-activate it then find the correct ""play"" button on the remote screen. This frequently causes me to overshoot the program, requiring a backspace.I recommend a software update to make this user-friendly."
2,Disappointment,Fairly easy to setup. However the device works sometimes and sometimes not. For the cost of this control i expect for it to work all the time. I regret buying this product.
3,"Some good things, some not so good","It is easier to use, and quite intuitive. However, as opposed to simpler units, it requires the use of both hands.The software, however, degraded after some use, and had to be reinstalled. It keeps asking whether ""this solved the problem"", when the problem should not have surfaced to begin with. However, a couple of clicks later the problem is solved, but it reappears almost every time.So far we have not been able to delete the buttons in the ""watch TV"" screen (the ones designed, I think, to rewind and fast forward) so we cannot see the picture that we installed as the opening screen. One should be able to see the pict under the buttons or on the alternative one should not be able to place a personal pict in the screen.All in all, it is a good product and I am satisfied with it."
3,My initial experience with the Harmony 1000,"My experience with this was not what I expected. I like to think I have at least an average intellegence and can read technical manuals. I had run the setup program which didn't take to long to run. When I finished it was an almost OK setup. I ended up bringing my laptop in the same room as the TV, But that only helped a little. When I tried to Email Logitech their site was always under constriction, and I wasn't sure if my mesage went thru or not. I finally called the toll free number, got some one in India who to my surprise was able to get my remote up and working with almost no problems. He was good and understandable. For almost a month before the call I had 5 remotes where I had had 4. And my frustation level was very high. I not sure I would do this again for this price even though it works fine now."
1,The 1000,"So far, this remote isn't worth above $50. I purchased this remote to control my home-theater. It did not control the satellite television box, and when it did, it lost control of my av-receiver. I had Higher expectations, but I'll have to live with itTHIS REMOTE IS CRAP"
2,"Tolerable, but it locks up a lot...","I have this remote for controlling my home theater equipment. I have a projector, DVD with Escient Fireball, AV Receiver, Xbox 360, cable box and an Apple TV. The remote works OK, but it does lock up a lot causing me to have to pull out the battery and re-install it to get it to start working on.On the other hand, I have a Harmony 880 for my family room equipment and I never have any trouble with that device."
4,Good Remote - But Not For the Novice,"This remote works great. It took me a few hours to get it just the way I like it. If you love techie stuff and have the time and inclination to tweak it you will be very happy with it. I was surprised how much messing with it was needed to get it just right, but now that I have spent the time I am quite happy with it. Be warned - you will need to roll up your sleeves to get the full effect."
1,Do not purchase this remote,"I've had a Harmony 1000 for just over 18 months. The setup is pretty simple as long as you're running Windows. The setup software allegedly works on Mac, but I could never get it running correctly. It is very nice having a nice-looking remote that controls all (up to 6, no more than 6) the A/V devices in my living room.The disappointing aspect of this remote is that the build quality is so poor. The touch screen is squishy and responds poorly. I don't have especially large fingers, but getting to several touch screen controls is very difficult.This is a product that should be marketed at closer to $80. Because of the poor quality, it is likely that you will (as I have) need to replace it after 12-18 months of use."
1,"Unless you want to spend hours in your pc setting up a remote, this is not for you.","Terrible experience. They force you to register an account with them before you can start configuring your remote. The software asked me to download and to ""upgrade"" the control software about 5 times befre I could even start the ""configuration process"". It was a nighmare experience. I was very exited when I got the control yesterday and after many hours working on the configuration, I will sell it. Logitech is a PC devices company and the harmony 1000 its a failed attempt to extend their a PC device to your home. Perhaps if you have only 3-4 components to install this might be a good option, but with more devices I strongly reccomend that you dont buy this control."
1,harmony remote is loaded with flaws,"I spent 11,000 on a system from bestbuyThey cannot fix the harmony problemThey are not willing to fess up to the issue with this remoteI am presently working on a class action lawsuit to wake bestbuy up"
1,Not worth the money,At the price I paid for this remote it should work wonders. But it doesn't. It usually never turns on all or sets all my devices correctly. My other less expensive Harmony remotes works much better. I will be3 returning this one. Don't bother buying this one.
3,It's harder than it looks,"We ordered this universal remote based on the salesman at our local Best Buy saying it was a must-have for our home theatre room... it would be if we could get it working. My husband has been trying for three weeks to get all of the information loaded to get it to work, but so far, no luck. One of the problems is that we are trying to get it to synch up 2 video game players, a DVD, a receiver, a projector, a Cable Box and a DVR... if the computer was in the same room with all of the equipment it might be easier. You have to tell the remote exactly what it needs to do for every function that you want it to perform. My husband has called Logitech a few times for assistance, but it is just going to take time... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
4,Great Product With Room for Improvement,"I have a six component system (including an Apple TV box) and am very pleased with the performance of the Harmony 1000 and the ease of system setup. However, I attempted to use a new Intel iMac running the Leopard OS to set up the remote and was unsuccessful. The remote programming software locked up. Fortunately, I had already installed VMware's Fusion software and was able to boot up Windows XP on the iMac. Once I was operating in a Windows environment, programming the remote was a snap.BOTTOM LINE: The Harmony 1000 is a good value for the money if you can set it up in a Windows OS. Folks that are limited to an Apple OS will experience problems. I'm not the first person to report this. Hopefully, Logitech will get their software updated to resolve this situation soon."
2,1000 is very flukey,"Purchased the Harmony 1000 with expectations that it might be complicated to set up, but would work fine once that was done. NOT!!! Although the tech support from Logitech was superb, the damned thing would not stay programmed. It would work for a little while, then it would stop activating the television, even though it was taught to do it again and again. Finally, after several hours with tech support, and a week afterward trying to iron out the bugs, I had to return it, much to my regret as it looks great and was ultimately very easy to use -- if only it actually worked!"
2,Absolute POS!!,Look into a good universal remote but NOT the Logitech Harmony 1000. Cost $250.00 and isn't compatible with Windows 7 64 bit or MAC Lion. Its a cool THOUGHT for a remote but not worth the trouble given the many software errors.
3,Easy to operate but a challenge to configure properly,"Pros:- Easy to operate.- Nice touch screen displayCons:- A challenge to setup to control multiple audio/video devices simultaneously.My setup: CableVision DVR (Hi-Def), Sharp Aquous LCD TV, Panasonic DVD/DVR player/recorder."
3,Hard to connect to electronics,"The Harmony Remote is very handy, because it can control many items. It was very hard to set up and get our electronic components into it. We had to make several calls to their hotline and make several adjusments. It also has a tendency to lose some setups occasionally. Also it does not shoot through the doors of our cabinet to control certain items, like it said it should. WE are still working on that issue."
1,You can tell it's windoze-based,"Unlike what several reviewers say, you can in fact make it work with a Mac if you use your head a little.However, they ought to put a reset button somewhere on the outside of the bloody thing. It freezes every so often, just like a peecee, so you have to pop the battery out and wait for the idiotic thing to go through it's lengthy startup procedure every time this happens. (What on earth can it be doing during that?)You sure can tell whenever Windows is involved. (The blasted thing has some version or other of Windows CE inside it.)"
1,"Don't Buy, you will be let down","I originally purchased one of these in Dec 2007. That one broke in July 2008, the screen went white and wouldn't reset. Logitech replaced that one under warranty. Guess what, the screen just went white on that one less than 10 months later. Logitech refuses to fix it and wont replace it under warranty since it has been over a year since the initial purchase. Don't buy this remote, it will break on you, it is just a matter of when."
4,Great remote the second time,I purchased this remote seeking a simple operation. I received it and it worked great after my son programed it. I was actually surprised how simple the operation is. The first remote I received had a malfunction in it and I was sent a new one. It works great just as advertised. I do recommend getting the rf receptors(cost extra)
1,Horrible customer support,Battery lasted less than 2 weeks. Replacement battery has been promised that it is in the mail for 30 days. If you purchase this item pray that you will not need customer support.
1,A useless peice of rubbish,I have owned this for one day. Its going back......It stopped working almost instantly. Has Java errors like crazy and updating the Firmware and the Software produce no result. After waiting for ever for tech support decided to send it back instead.
1,logitech harmony 1000,bought this for christmas. Did all the loading of all my systems. It worked for about 10 minutes then the screen froze and I could'nt do anything. Called logitech directly and they walked me through a couple of things to do to try to fix it. NOTHING WORKED. Returned it to amazon for a replacement thinking maybe I received a bad one. Instead I received a refund and now the price it alot higher so of course I will not be purchased it.
1,Less than 1 star,"I also used to be a Logitech dealer until our customers experienced these same type of firmware problems. Remotes freaks out and locks up, volume go's up in middle of night without touching the remote, RF extender looses connectivity with remote, etc. We have sold over 35 harmony 890 and 1000's half of which have been replaced with a Universal Remote 850 or 900. One customer returned a 890 remote in a zip lock bag after smashing it with a hammer - needless to say he was upset. Harmony remotes are made for consumers who want to program the remote themselves (if the customer can wire and setup a/v equipment then they should have no problem programming) they only offer basic functionality due to the closed software architecture. Our company refuses to program Logitech Universal remotes for our customers, because we can not guarantee results."
3,Logitech Harmony 1000,"Logitech Harmony 1000 Advanced Universal RemoteVery easy to use. Does not always find the right setting for the activity I chose, many times I needed to p[ush the help repeatedly to finally reach the right setting?"
2,STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOWSY REMOTE!!!,"THIS REMOTE HAS DEFECTS AND BUGS I DIDNT LISTENTEN TO THE REVIEWS AND BOUGHT IT ANYWAYS, AFTER SPEAKING WITH TECH SUPPORT NO ONE COULD SOLVE ANYTHING SPEND 3 HRS ON THE PHONE FOR A REMOTE TO END RESULT OF NOTHING. I SENT THE REMOTE BACK TO AMAZON. BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR SELF A HEADACHE DONT GET THIS REMOTE!!!!!"
3,Wait till mobile phone comes with this,I will wait before paying $375 (as I think my money is previous) for this. I own an iPhone and screen looks exactly like this. It has the harware to do it and an excellent user interface. I would wait till iPhone doubles up as Harmony with not so alpha version like feature. Compaq iPaq had that too.
4,"If it worked, it would be great","Having used the remote for several years, it works about 98% of the time without any issues. Once in a while, we have to take out the battery if it locks up. But this doesn't happen that often. We purchased this particular remote as it was also supposed to support Z-Wave. We purchased Z-Wave light switches and we were going to program the lights to dim when you hit play, come up half way when you hit pause and come up all the way when hitting stop. Unfortunately, Logitech couldn't get it right and they removed this feature from their remotes. Still enjoy using the remote, it is our family room remote and it has held up well with heavy use."
5,Great Remote,"I had the old phillips pronto and stopped using it when I bought my Sony HD TV. I downloaded the software to the Harmony and within 30 minutes I was done and ready to test it. Everything worked perfect the very first time. I made some tweaks and custom changes and they also worked the very first time. For the money and no need to have a technician come out and set it up, the computer does it all for you. Unbelievable until you see it for yourself. It puts the TV on the correct inputs and tuns on only the devices needed for the function. Stereo inputs work the same way. It truly is an amazing remote control."
5,Logitech Harmony 1000 + extender,"Set up on the computer is very user friendly. Eventhough there was one command the remonte didn't want to perform, but after help from customer service (very knowledgeable and helpful) the remote now works like a charm. My non-computer literate husband understands and uses the remote with ease."
4,Excelent Remote Control,"This is an excellent universal remote control, bit pricy and tricky to program, but once you spent time and get to know how it works, is wonderfull.I can control my entirely home theatre (HD TV, Receiver, Ipod, Tivo, HD DishNetwok, DVD/VCR combo, 5 disc CD player, HD DVD ).In a normal use (all days, 2 hours, except for the weekends that I used it more) the battery life is 6 days, which is not bad at all.Logitech should improve the programing control of the buttons, so we can have a better remote."
1,Not worth the money,"We purchased this item in December 2008. It is not worth the money. We have it programmed to turn on the TV, DVR and the AV receiver when we tap the ""watch tv"" function. 75% of the time it only turns on one of the 3 units. Same thing when we attempt to turn off all 3. It freezes up at least once a week and we have to go online to reset it. The option to talk to a customer service rep, if support is needed, is only free for the first few months. Also, the screen needs to be recalculated quite frequently-- otherwise the button you tap, may not be the one you wanted."
3,"remote good, software bad","I recently bought this remote and the extender. The remote control now works very well with my components ... it only took 4 hours of programming and 1 week of tweaking to get everything to work together. The software used to program the remote needs great improvement, constantly locks up, and the component database either lacks new models from the manufacturers list or doesn't fully support all the buttons on OEM remotes. The remote can be customized, but you need to think outside the box. I would recommed the product, but be patient."
1,Unfinished firmware/software,"I bought the remote some time ago and was very excited with it initialy. However right away problems began to surface. The remote would lock up and require the battery be removed/reinstalled to remedy the lock up, a few times each week. Now there has been a firmware update to correct this and other problems experienced by other users, and having begun the update it won't finish. I'm left with a non functioning remote. I've left three email services tickets and each time the promise is that a rep will return my email in 24 hours. It's now been one new ticket for each of the three days with no return email within 72 hours for any. My recommendation would be for you to wait till the bugs are worked out. Read Logitechs own forum for confirmation of my experiences and the future resolutions."
4,Harmony 1000 does not support Z-wave,"I purchased the 1000 specifically for this purpose. Everything else works fine.This was posted on Logitech Forum on July 12, 2007:The Logitech Harmony 1000 was announced in September 2006 at CEDIA. Although Z-Wave lighting was never formally announced, the plan at that time was to have full Z-wave support of third-party Z-Wave Modules. Since that date Logitech has made the decision not to offer control of Z-Wave compatible lighting and home automation equipment for the Harmony 1000 remote. The company is focused instead on improving the interaction with the Harmony 1000 as it relates to the control of audio & video entertainment devices."
3,Does NOT control ZWAVE products!!!,"I just got off the phone with the Logitech helpdesk and they informed me that they have decided to not offer the ability for the Harmony 1000 to control zwave lighting. Even though it was advertised as such it will NOT control zwave products. That being said, this is the fourth logitech harmony remote that I have in my house. It controls everything else great and is very easy to set up. Great looking too."
1,Do not purchase this item...,"If you are planning to have control with Z-wave as logitech Harmony H1000 promotes, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM, it does not control Z-wave devices, too expensive for only audio / video devices control."
2,Concept is Great but execution bites!!!,"Simply put, the one I received arrived DEFECTIVE. It will not charge for anything. I called Logitech they are supposed to be sending me a new charger & stand but I am not even going to wait for that. It's going back to Amazon tomorrow morning. FYI It works very well with MAC & it does what it promises but something as simple as not charging is just NOT acceptable."
1,TOTAL JUNK,"Having been very pleased with the model 650, I decided to ""upgrade"" to the model 1000. What a mistake. Contrary to what Logitech claims, the Mac ""solution"" does not work. Blank screens abound in the programming process. You go down long roads and think everything is going well, and then you click next, and blank screen. No way to go back, you must start all over again, leading to the same result. I tried the model 1000, and the 1100, both total junk. I trew both of them into the trash and went back to my 650. I will NEVER buy another Logitech product."
1,don't buy this remote,"Bought this remote over a year ago... nothing but problems. Own many Harmony remotes and while the most expensive, it is the worst. If it worked, it still would be awkward. I would purchase a Harmony One at half the price. Don't waste your money!!!!"
3,"Ok remote, BEWARE FALSE ADVERTISING","The remmote works decently enough, however I bought it because I also needed control of Z-wave products (RF). This remote is described as Z-wave compatible (and until very recently, even on logitechs own web site). However, it does NOT support Z-wave. From my understanding it has the hardware compatibility but Logitech has decided not to support it.I recommend the Logitech 890. It is clearly the superior remote."
4,Logitech Harmony 1000 - very nice!,"The product pricing was outstanding and the delivery prompt. Except for an intial problem programming the unit (had to eliminate router from between computer and cable modem), the setup was a breeze. It really is universal and ties all my components together. You have to get used to the rectangular shape which is tough once you have gotten used to the handgrip shape of other remotes, but it truly solves the problem of setting up and powering off all the components making up my system."
3,Harmony 1000,Good replacement if you have more than 4 remotes.Programming was ok.Battery life good.Interface starts to lag after a few days and requires a restart (annoying).
1,Avoid Deal Stop,"I'll start by saying that this unit was originally provided in the package provided by our high end audit video vendor, less than two years ago. The touch screen failed on the original unit, but it was cheaper to buy another one to work with our system, rather than pay over $1,000 for a new programmed unit. I ordered two units from Deal Stop ([...]) which were supposed to be new and under warranty. One unit appears new, but the package was open and the battery was replaced with one that does not fit the unit. The second package was also open, and clearly, the unit was used, old, scratched and a mess, and the install CD was missing, and accessories were just thrown in the box. Very disapointing."
2,Dead 2yrs later,"If you have unlimited time to program or are willing to have someone do it for you; If you have the patience to reboot at least once a week; If you pay for an extended warranty; If you understand that support is poor for the first year; Then this is the remote for you. Fragile, frustrating, but works very well 90% of the time. I'll buy a 1100 to replace my 1000, but I am not happy about it."
1,Not good!,I have a temendous ammount of trouble switching functions on my home theater. I have reprogramed the remote several times. I alos bought a range extender thinking that may be the problem it was not. The remote is of very poor quality. The touch screen is hit and miss and the lay out on the touch screen is not good. I is dificulut to navigate. I have purchase Logitech products in the past this is the worst one I have owned. Very disapointing.
2,Forgetful remote,"Frustrating remote to say the least. It constantly ""forgets"" how to control the components and even to send the signals. The remote locks up quite a bit which requires the remote to be shut down and plugged into the computer to reprogram. Not worth the money by a far shot."
4,Nice controller,"I replaced an older Harmony with the 1000 and found the programming to be the same. This device is larger and easier to handle. The big plus is the recharge station. I only give 4 stars because of the positioning of the IR transmitter. It's sort of on the bottom edge of the unit and you must tilt the unit vertically. If the unit is laying flat, it doesn't transmit to the controlled devices well."
5,Great Product,"I received the item in a timely manner and once I got through a bit of confusion (based on adding the 1000 when I already had the 890 model), it worked more or less flawlessly. I have a few issues to work through, but they relate to my having a rather complicated combination of components. I think it is going to work out great and would recommend the product highly."
1,doesn't work - not compatable with Vista - waste of money,"I bought two of these units thinking they would solve my remote problems. Not. I should say that I've been installing stereo components for myself since 1978 and have had every major component manufacturer's product at one time or another.After following all the directions and hooking this up to the computer I found that the software is incompatable with Vista and requires serious on-line help. Perhaps, if I was more patient and was willing to spend the 12 - 15 hours to figure this out I could do it myself. I am not. Personally, I believe the electronics industry should be sued for Deceptive Trade Pratices for the efforts it takes to integrate these components, but that's another story. By the way, I have a technical degree from a well known university and am a products liability attorney so I'd like to think I'm not a dummy as to this stuff. Suffice it to say that this, like many consumer proiducts, is junk."
2,"Great at first, but loses it's appeal after a couple weeks.","Our family loved the remote at first, but after a couple weeks the remote becomes more of a hassle than it is helpful. It seems to lose it's programming or just decides not to turn equipment off and on in the proper sequence. If you reprogram it, it will work great for a bit longer, but then starts getting retarded again. We have switched back to the original remotes now."
4,Great Remote,"I have used Harmony before but this is one of the best remotes you can buy. It pairs well with all of my devices, though it does have some problems switching inputs on the tv when you use the activity feature. However, it does correct this if you push the help feature on the remote. The only CON I have is that the battery doesn't fit correctly in the remote control so I had to make a holder out of cardboard. Also it does freeze every once in a while."
1,Don't Buy This!,There is a reason that Logitech discontinued this unit and came out with the 1100. The 1100 is a far superior unit. Spend the extra $40 to get the 1100. You won't regret it.
1,not at harmony with my 1100,"hi, i bought a logitech harmony 1100 about a year ago, i programmed it for my pioneer vsa-ax10, it came out as a receiver(its an amplifier) so i had lots of useless buttons, and many wanted ones missing, i programmed it for my pioneer pd91 it came out blank, pioneer bdp-lx91 incorrect, old denon dvd-5000 incorrect, it got my panasonic plasma correct and my yam sub correct, i've been in contact with logitech many times (all a waste of)it time now to stomp on it, its easier to have a handful of handsets believe me"
4,Works well for me,"I've had several Logitec remotes over the years and while this model has been replaced by a newer one, it works well for me. Mine is a refurbished unit that attracted me because of the significantly lower price. Having already set up my account with the company it was easy for me to simply plug in this ""new"" unit and download my devices and settings. A caveat to the buyer, the software for this unit is problematic on Mac since it is an older model and there is some issue with the drivers. It worked fine for me on a Windows machine though.The touch screen is a little bit annoying sometimes but if one is careful to hit the ""buttons"" properly it works o.k."
3,Good for static people,Good for static people? What I mean is for those folks who don't fast forward or use the touch screen.. I'm a TIVO guy and a FFWD guy and having to watch your thumb to make sure you hit the button and stop it before the commercials are over.. Not Good..I have the Harmony One and now have a 890 replacing this one.. It's a sweet eye catching device.. but functional for us non static users---Not so much.
4,A Great Remote,"This is a great remote, at first i was having trouble with it locking up, It seems that removing and placing it on the charging cradle was the problem. Now i just charge as needed. this remote works with all my devices, a Samsung BR player, Toshiba HDDVD, Xox360 elite , DTV HDDVR, HDMI Switch , Yamaha Sound bar and My Sony 40 inch LCD. The one thing i was most surprised with was it worked with the HDMI Switch."
5,WOW!,"Faced with five remotes on the table it was time for a universal remote. After reading many reviews and going to actually going to see and touch many of them I settled on the Harmony 1000. Wow! This is a great remote. While it may take some time to gather all the input information from your audio-video equipment the actual programming was easy. It worked as programmed the first time. I can now finally operate my CD carousel by remote. While I seldom use it,I'm also going back in to program the unit to operate my VCR. The simplicity is wonderful. Just press Watch a DVD, Listen to Radio, Listen to CD, etc and the right units come on. I am a happy camper."
4,A Good Universal Remote,"This particular universal remote is good in that it allows for controlling several electronic components such as watch tv, dvd, cable etc. It is somewhat limited with respect to its competor, the Pronto, it that the Pronto has greater flexibility with macros and allows for greater customization of functions. The Pronto is, however, more expensive that the Harmony 1000."
5,Thank You Logitech & Amazon,"I own several Logitech Remotes and they all work great.The Harmony 1000 is by far the best remote I ever owned.Large viewing screen for the over 50 generation, feels great in your hands with the non slip backing.Programing was easy with the included software.If your looking for a remote that controls everthing, buy this one.You can't beat the price that Amazon has to offer, I have seen it in stores for almost double what Amazon sells it for.Thanks Again Logitech & Amazon."
2,This is the sequel?,"This story did not seem realistic to me, there were too many things in it that I could not believe would ever happen. While the artwork was good, I didn't like the way Venom was designed. For the most part it didn't feel like it belonged in the whole May being captured saga, but many graphic novel trilogies seem to do that.As a side note, if Spiderman's so hated by the general public, where do these people get all the Spidey outfits from?"
1,"Venom....oh wait, this isn't Venom, this is A FAKE","I am a HUGE venom fan. I have a shelf of nothing but venom comics. I have Venom Action Figures, Shirts, heck I even have a Mask of him!!!!!So when I saw this storyline I was excited. However, the very first thing that turned me away was the artwork. I don't like the new way Venom is drawn, so that's not appealing. He just doesn't....feel right this way.Next is the storyline. The REAL Venom, with the symbiote/eddie brock is no more. That right there is also another turn off for the story. When I say ""VENOM"" I mean Eddie Brock and the Venom Symbiote, not somebody else and the symbiote. Eddie/Venom just have one of the coolest combined minds ever, and they're so much fun to watch in action they way they act together.Personally, the storyline, art, and characters I thought were all bad. The REAL Venom's gone, and I didn't enjoy watching him leave. 1 Star, and that's being GENEROUS."
3,National Geographic Trip Planner 2002 - Good but not Great,"I will keep this simple. The clarity and ease of use of Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2002 has no rival.National Geographic does bring to bear some of their excellent pics. and info. from the parks in their multimedia disk component of their package, but the list of parks was not nearly as complete as I had hoped, nor were more out of the way spots easy to set as waypoints - or even to locate.I can do what needs to be done, without frustration, using the Microsoft product in less than a fourth of the time that it takes me to use the NG product.The NG product is clearly better than anything Rand Mc. ever put out.If you enjoy planning trips with software just for the sake of it, and want another program to complement the Microsoft offering, this is the one for you."
3,Watch what you order,I ordered this disk as new for the higher price and got a used scratched one for the price of a new . I hadn't ordered a different one because of this. Do like the music so I'll keep it but I'll be more careful in the future. The stars is for the music.
4,Fine Texas Blues,"Joe Pullum was a falsetto voiced blues singer from Houston Texas who recorded extensively in 1934 - 1936, and is best remembered for his major hit, the blues standard ""Black Gal"".This CD, the first of two volumes of his complete recordings, features Pullum with two excellent Texas pianists of the Santa Fe school, Rob Cooper and Andy Boy. Rob Cooper had a two fisted technique in part influenced by the Harlem stride pianists, while Andy Boy (from Galveston) was a more inventive accompanist. Both pianists draw on such classic Santa Fe pieces as the Ma Grinder in their accompaniments.Pullum's vocal style could be a little cloying, but it is compensated for by the effectiveness of his accompanists. Lovers of Texas piano in particular should get this disc."
5,This book can make anyone feel all tingly inside.,"I would read this book when I was depressed from the time I was a little girl until now. At age 17, I still read this book when I am upset and it has yet to lose it's ability to make me feel better. Every page brings a smile to my face."
5,"Everything I needed except a light, and sized for a woman","Casio's button layout is always simple and easy to use. This watch has all the functions I need (time, day, date of course, plus stopwatch, alarm, and even a countdown alarm) along with simplicity and water resistance. The smaller size is much nicer for a woman than the large man's Casio watch I had been wearing. The only thing that I miss is having a light so I'm able to see what time it is in low/no light."
4,A very good deal with lots of features,I have bought this model of watch now at least 4 times. I am a middle-aged woman and I find the count-down timer the best feature. I use it several times a day. I also use the alarm in the morning. The watch is slim and functional. The reason I replaced the other watches was that the band broke. I have replaced the band in the past but this time (after wearing the watch daily for at least 3 years) I looked into the cost of a new band and decided to replace the watch instead. The buttons were not as easy to push since I had replaced the battery a few times and the buttons did not stick out as far as they were when it was new. I am very happy with this watch and hope in a few years it will still be for sale. (P.S. I swim with it in the ocean every summer and it is fine.)
5,1-3-5-10-15-20-30 min timer you set without looking!,"Best gift I ever received 18 years ago, and now I always have spareS. Tried to get Casio to market as ""The Mother's Watch."" If the oven timer is in use, I poke my wrist 4x which sets 10 min warning for the eggs. I poke 2x and tell the kids ""I'll be with you in 3 minutes"", and no argument--it keeps both of us honest! I can shop and not obsess about the clock; I just poke my wrist, as I think ""1-3-5-10-15-20-30"" and it's set to ""beepbeepbeep"" when I have to go. I attach to my glasses to catnap in the car. Poke 7 times (sets 30 minutes) and it prompts me to do 4 laundry loads in 2 hours. Even Scrabble timer. It's PERFECT--nice and flat on your wrist-- Tells time, date, stopwatch, too. And I buy replacement bands at WALMART 13mm--in braided or flatleather--keep checking back for stock. Also Mall Kiosks. Love the simplicity. The best GIFT FOR NEW MOMS!"
2,Just what I needed but a little PROBLEM!!,"I purchased this watch online and have had this same watch for about 20 years. When I was unable to buy it at Sears this year I thought Amazon was the perfect place. Unfortunately, I found that the alarm is backwards - AM versus PM so now I have to remember to set the alarm for the opposite time so the alarm will go off i.e. PM for a morning wakeup! I don't have time to send this back and since I bought two, I haven't checked the other one. I left for vacation the second day I got it so, even though I love this watch, I am very disappointed that I got one with a glitch!"
4,Mom's helper,"I've used this watch for many years (though haven't been able to find it in stores for a while). It is perfect for Moms of small children, as the countdown feature is a great help for time-outs! No arguing from the kids (is my time up yet?) -- they know when the timer goes off. Plus, if they whine, they know I will press that button once more, and they will have more time! I have even given this watch as a baby shower gift for just this purpose!"
2,alarm does not work,"Alarm does does not work,that is what I wanted when I purchased this watch. Directions were very hard to understand.Did not know where to get simply directions. I spent way to much time trying to set alarm."
2,Not what I expected,"This watch keeps good time and the alarm comes in handy, but it was much, much smaller than its picture would lead you to believe. It looks like it is meant for a child to wear."
4,love this watch!!!,"This is about the third time I've bought this watch. The watch itself never quits. The plastic/rubber strap will crack or break first, and then the battery will finally die (after a normal life span). I found it less expensive to just buy a new watch, than to replace the battery and the strap.It has all the functions you might need. Love the alarm and the count down timer. I use the stop watch feature for running and I wear it swimming all the time. Never a problem.Also, it is slimmer than most sport watches. It doesn't look ""clunky"" even if I wear it with dressier clothes."
3,"Product is fine, delivery was not","The product itself is nice, functional and cheap. However, having UPS as the only delivery option is extremely inconvenient, unless you can afford the luxury of staying at home the day of delivery or have a very predictable work day."
5,Wonderful teacher's watch,"Awesome watch for a teacher because it has an incredibly easy to set alarm feature. Just push one button to set a timer for 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, or 30 min. This allows you to give students a few more minutes on an activity or a test without having to watch the clock yourself. It's also great around the house as a timer for laundry or cooking. I wouldn't be without my timer watch."
5,Best Value Watch,"I have owned 3 of these watches now and have LOVED every one of them. The watch is easy to use and has an incremental alarm (1-3-5-10-15-30-min), as well as a regular alarm which are very easy to set. Great size amd easy to read. Even though the band is aome sort of rubber - none of mine have ever failed. The ONLY reason I have replaced them is that I have MISplaced them! A+ watch for a really reasonable price. Well done, Casio!"
3,So So,"It is a good watch if you like a small watch. Setting the alarm is easy. Everything functions well, I just don't like the size"
3,"Not quite as I expected, but keeps good time.","The printed instructions must be for someone who has far better eyesight than I. Also, I had hoped to be able to set the alarm to go off twice dailey, but thus far I've only achieved one setting. (The whole point of buying this watch was the alarm feature (to alert me to take two medications that are time critical)."
3,Price is ok but very small face and function settings,"I needed a digital with a timer again - had a great one that quit after years of working. Ordered this one, but didn't realize that the size would be this small. I wear glasses and I cannot read the available timer minutes on the top of the face. The clock display is ok, not good in the dark - and for me, I could use a larger one. That said, if you have tiny fingers (the buttons to set the timer and clock are very very small) killer eyes to read very small detail and want to only spend a few bucks, this is a good deal. The band is comfy for what it is, the watch doesn't take up your whole wrist like some of the larger ones - so just be aware and select a different model if you need a bit more real estate. It arrived fine, quick and the price is great - just not the watch for me."
4,light weight,"This is the 7th watch like this I have bought over the years, and will continue to buy them as long as they are available. There is a timer that is in increments of 1,3,5,10,15,20,25,30 minutes, great for cooking. Plus an alarm and the date."
4,Have used one of these since childhood,"I love the feature for quick timers on the top of this watch and got it because I wanted something cheap, reliable, and easy hour chime. My hearing has got so bad that I couldnt hear the chimes at first, especially the timer ones, when they went off. But I've become more sensitive to it after a little while. If you have high frequencies hearing loss this watch may not be what you are looking for, however for a real wake up alarm you should always use two alarms anyway, and you should pick something louder than this. I believe I did use it years ago for that function though when my hearing was better. I like the stop watch on this better than my sports watch, too so I prefer to use this one for certain functions."
1,broke within a month,This watch broke within a month. It was the plastic part of the watch and no way to even glue it. Sad.
4,I Love this Watch,"I've owned this specific watch in the past, and was very upset when I lost it. It is pretty basic, easy to use, and very compact. Not bulky at all. The only feature I miss on this watch is that there is no light function to light up the face in the dark. If you're looking for a digital watch that isn't bulky like most, this is the one to get!"
5,My favorite watch,"This is the best watch I have ever had, but it is not available in stores. It isn't fancy, but it is very practical. It is waterproof and it has a great timer feature. It is simple to set the timer for 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes, or there is an alarm that can be set for any time within 24 hours."
4,Pretty durable,"I've had this style of watch for the past 5 years. This watch's band snapped in half, the band part on one side broke in half. So I bought this watch again because I liked it so much. I lost it for an hour, and found it an hour later to be ripped apart from the clock part. But I managed to put it back together quite easily. Unfortunately the buckle part has fallen off now and I think I'll go questing for another watch style."
5,casio women's LA11WB-1 watch,"for the lady or man in the kitchen, this watch has an easy to use 5 minute timer that adds 5 minutes each time you push the little button so you will be alerted when it's time to turn your steak, baste your dinner in the oven, lower the temp, that you cookies are done and a whole list of other helpful uses. the watch beeps to alert you to attend to what you've set it to remind you to do....we're all getting older and just hate to find your hard earned pecan pie turned to charcoal in the oven because you wandered off and forgot it!!!"
2,No display light.........,"I bought this watch without realizing that it doesn't have a light button. You can't light up the display to check the time in the middle of the night. I assumed all electronic watches have this feature, so it didn't even occur to me to check the feature set carefully. Not worth sending it back, either. Oh well...."
1,Rip off,"The watch arrived with the battery shot. Clearly old stock. We had unfortunately thown away the box, so we're just eating the watch. Won't buy this here again.EBB"
2,"Agree with Scottsdale reviewer, and more thoughts...","I agree with the reviewer from Scottsdale. I revere Sitchin as perhaps the world's preeminent scholar in this field. However, his most recent work seems to be going in circles. We've read it all, and very entusiastically. However, where are our ancestors today? When will the planet in the 3600 year orbit next be visible? I'd like to see Sitchin's attempts to link ancient earth mysteries to unsolved modern myserties, such as the earth's energy grid, the Bermuda Triangle, the ""afterlife"", psychic ability, and even a more in-depth discussion of the astrology/astronomy rift. Mr. Sitchin, if anyone in the world can do this, you alone are qualified in your most unassuming and appealing manner. It's time to take your work to the next level!"
4,Interesting,"I think this is a good book, interesting for the people who are looking for some answers."
3,Z.Sitchin amazes with commanding insight into myth & history,"Once history is laid bare, the amazing Z.Sitchin will have surely introduced a major part of its enigma in his serial of Earth Chronicles.Keys to unfolding the mystery of man's connections with the universe. Open wide, the truth may be stranger than fiction!You will either love it or hate it, but you can't refuse the challenge of completing it!"
2,Skip this one if you've read his others...,"Hardly any new material and haphazard organization made this book a difficult read. I was disappointed, since all of his other books I would give 5 stars. This book looks like a sorry attempt to dredge up old material and put it in a new package to increase book sales. Has our uniquely talented author succumbed to mass marketing hysteria?"
2,Provocative But More Of The Same Material,"After having read most of Sitchin's books, I keep hoping he'll come up with one that contains hard evidence and not just provocative theories. Maybe that will never come. Meanwhile, I've been reading a book called COSMIC TEST TUBE, which contrasts Sitchin's ideas and 'evidence' with those of all other authors writing in the ancient astronaut genre. There are some legitimate mysteries out there, as COSMIC TEST TUBE skillfully points out. I only wish Sitchin would pay attention to the work of other authors in the field."
2,I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED,"I HEARD @ THIS BOOK AND WAS LOOKING SO FORWARD TO READING IT. I WAS DISSAPOINTED. THIS BOOK WAS FILLED WITH BORE. SOME PARTS PEAKED MY CURIOUSITY. THE COMPARISONS OF ANCIENT LITERATURE WITH THE BIBLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVING THE BIBLES VARACITY WERE WELL RESEARCHED AND PROVEN, TO ME ANYWAY. I AM VERY INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT OF ""WHO WAS HERE FIRST"", AND ""WHO CREATED HUMANS"" ETC. THIS BOOK DIDNT DO IT FOR ME. I ENJOYED THE GODS OF EDEN BY BRAMELY MUCH MUCH MORE. I WILL, HOWEVER, READ ONE MORE ZS BOOK. IF I LIKE THE NEXT, THEN I WILL CONTINUE ON WITH HIS WORKS. I DO COMEND HIS RESEARCH ABILITIES AND VAST KNOWLEDGE OF ANCIENT LANGUAGES."
1,Up to Sitchin's usual standard,"This work is up to Sitchin's usual standard, unfortunately. Trash and nonsense from beginning to end. The most basic facts of science, not to mention the observations of common-sense, are ignored. It is truely frightening that at the end of the 20th Century there are enough gullible people in countries with high technology and expensive public education systems for this sort of thing to flourish. Proves that if you keep an open mind people will throw all their garbage into it."
1,"Read ""The Man-Kzin Wars"" Instead!","Read Larry Niven's ""Tha Man-Kzin Wars"" in 8 vols. It is honest, imaginative science-fiction and there is enough of it to make a good long saga now. Or anything by Poul Anderson.You will also pick up some real science, unlike this garbage that pretends to be true!"
1,"questionable research, questionably concluded from","I'm quite a fan of paranormal--admitting that this descriptor covers a tremendous range of material, from hard-core zoology to pseudo-pseudoscientific nonsense--so I know whereof I speak. Sitchin is a buttonheaded muttonhead. I've yet to discern the merest kernel of anything meaningful or reliable in his opera (plural of opus, not singular of hackneyed-horn-helmeted-Viking-singing-arias). A particularly adept reviewer once reviewed Sanderson's ""Investigating the Unexplained"" as ""Explaining the Uninvestigated."" I wish I had both coined it and applied it to this nonsensical work and its ilk (eleven or so other volumes of affine nonsense)."
5,Vermont cop solves a cold case with personal baggage,"A domestic call gone bad deals Vermont's Bureau of Investigation agent Joe Gunther a second chance from the past. The gun involved in the domestic turns out to be one used in the unsolved fatal pistol whipping of a shopkeeper 30 years earlier. Gunther's young wife had been dying of cancer at the time and he's always felt he dropped the ball.This new evidence allows him to reopen the case and Gunther's painstaking, canny sleuthing is a pleasure to follow as he pursues each lead into the past and around New England. Not that this is any quiet cozy. Not once witnesses begin turning up dead faster than Gunther can track them down. On the personal side, his longtime love, Gail, is running for state senator and Gunther dislikes everything about the political arena and its effect on her. Well-plotted and character driven, this thoughtful series keeps getting better.- Portsmouth Herald"
5,IF YOU LIKE INTRIQUE...,"THEN THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU.HANZO IS BACK IN A STORY INVOLVING A HIGH RANKING PREIST'S CONSPIRACY TO RIP OFF THE SHOGUNATE'S TREASURY.THE RAZOR GETS PERSONALLY INVOLVED WHEN THE PREIST HAS HANZO'S FRIEND KILLED TO OBTAIN HIS PRICELESS SPEAR(A FAMILY TREASURE).THIS TAKES HANZO THROUGH MANY TWISTS AND TURNS UNTIL HE TRACKS DOWN THE LEADS TO THE PREIST AND THE CHAMBERLAIN. GREAT SAMURAI FIGHTS,INTRIQUE,BEAUTIFUL CAMERA WORK,AND OF COURSE, THE SHOWDOWN WITH THE HENCHMAN WHO KILLED HIS FRIEND ,MAKE THIS MOVIE WELL WORTH PICKING UP."
2,Remo and Chuin deserve better,"As a kid, I LOVED this movie. After I read the series, I didn't like it as much. Fred Ward and Joel Grey certainly had the right look (although Chuin's attire wasn't proper, but his acting was perfect as Chuin). The origin was totally stupid, and McCleary wasn't portrayed right, either. This movie deserves a remake!"
2,"Horrible, just horrible","I ordered this movie because I love the Destoyer series of books. I thought that it would be great to see the books come to life. Wrong. The acting is probably the worst I have ever seen. Special effects are laughable. Reasons why I gave it two stars instead of one, I finally learned the correct way to say Chiun. Seeing a young Kate Mulgrew was an added bonus too. But not even these two things could pull this movie from the bottom of the barrel."
2,Where's the widescreen,"I liked the movie back in the day, and seeing it again recently was very nostalgic. If it was widescreen, I probably would have picked it up. If I wanted fullscreen, I'd just tape it the next time it runs on the SciFi channel."
2,big disappointment,"classic 80's adventure and one of my favorite movies of all time. i had been waiting years for this to be put on DVD and screamed with glee, like a little girl when i saw that it was. then my joy was killed when i read the fine print. it is only in full screen format. all theatrical releases (with the exception of Kubrick's films) are shot in some form of widescreen. whether it is 1.85:1 or 2.2:1 or whatever, they are always shot in widescreen. so why they didn't use the origial print in order to restore this film is beyond me. they didn't even add any extras. i don't see the point in putting it on DVD then. you are better off with the VHS version or just catch it on cable."
4,Move Over MR. Bond---Here comes Remo Willams,"A great cheesy mid 80's action flick--Replete with bad acting, cliched dialouge and perhaps one of the most blatant racial stereotypes to appear in any movie. Despite all this it was still perhaps the most entertaining movie EVER: it makes no atempt at seriousness its just pure fun. Great for a bunch of nearly braindead teenagers...Like me and my friends. Buy it rent it whatever just get your hand on this ""motion picture"" I promise you will not be dissapointed--ENJOY!"
5,Remo Williams,Our kids loved this movie. I didn't realize how old it was and how it needs a face lift...but still a great movie.
3,We loved this movie back in the day but...,Not bad but it doesn't hold up well to today's standards. We watched with our 20 something kids and they were completely bored. My wife and I liked it ok but we'd admit it doesn't really fair well against today's movies.
5,Awesome Movie,"Totally recommend this movie. Great movie with a touch of everything. Laughs, Action etc. One of those movies you would watch over & over again."
4,The Adventure was Great !!,"My son and I loved this movie when we first saw it in the 1980's. It was so inventive and interesting, and we wished the adventure had continued with a sequel. Fred Ward and Joel Gray were at their best. This year I was talking with a co-worker who thought he had seen all the best movies ever made. I ordered a DVD for him and one for my son who just graduated from college for Christmas. He said he now has a new favorite adventure movie of all time. It is a great movie for boys 8 years and up, that the parents will also love, too."
4,Love Campy,"My wife thinks there is something wrong with me for likingthis movie, she may be right. This campy movie is a favoriteof mine."
3,Not half bad B movie,"When I was a kid I used to sneak and read my dad's Remo Williams novels. Remo and his Little Father were favorites of mine and I mostly enjoyed the movie. Joel Gray as a Korean upset a lot of people but truthfully, no-one else could've played that role the way he did. The plot moves fast, the good guys are mostly true to the books and if you relax and just try to watch the thing through the eyes of the 17 year old boys it was filmed for you'll have a good time. I'd love to see a remake one day."
2,"4 Stars for the movie, 1 star for the DVD!","I can't tell you how disappointed I was when Remo Williams FINALLY was released to DVD and MGM had the temerity to release it in FULL-FRAME (pan and scan) rather than widescreen in its original theatrical aspect ratio! It's 2003, MGM...people are savvier about film than they used to be, and we want to see our favorite films the way they were originally presented in the theater! I don't even demand ""extras"" like commentary or making-of documentaries...just a crisp transfer in anamorphic widescreen with enhanced sound. Is that so much to ask?Four stars for the movie ""Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins"" - a wonderfully engaging '80s action-adventure flick that doesn't take itself too seriously, featuring terrific performances by Fred Ward and Joel Grey - and one star for the crummy presentation it received on DVD. Remo deserves so much better than this."
1,Nooooooo! Full Screen Format?! Why?!,"It wasn't until after I purchased this DVD that I realized it was full screen format. WHY, WHY, WHY?! Don't studios realize that we want widescreen? At the very least, they could put a large disclaimer on the front. This bites. Remo Williams is a great movie and deserves better than this cut rate DVD."
2,No Widescreen Version? Boo!,"This is a classic 80s film that I enjoyed greatly when I was much younger. I only buy DVDs these days because of their superior features and longevity compared to VHS. So I was happy to learn Remo Williams was finally coming out on DVD so I could add it to my collection.Alas, my hopes were shattered when I went to my local video store to pick up a copy. The movie only comes in FULL SCREEN. I am so disappointed. One of the best reasons to own a feature in DVD is to see it in widescreen, without the sides of the movie cut off to fit TVs with a 4:3 aspect ratio. But for some ungodly reason the studio has released Remo Williams in full screen. This is a very entertaining flick I want to see again in all it's silly, nostalgic, widescreen glory. I cannot forgive the people responsible for leaving it visually incomplete. Unless of course 4:3 IS the original format the movie was filmed in, which I seriously doubt.I give 4 stars for the movie, 1 for the format."
3,A tale of two films. One enjoyable One boring,The first half of the film was quite enjoyable. Joel Grey as 'Chun the master of Shinonjouh' was absolutely hilarious. He has so many great one liners that the movie is worth seeing just for those in and of themselves. It was also quite pleasant to see the relationship build between Remo (Fred Ward) and Chun.The action sequences although not spectacular were certainly entertaining and there are even some pretty good lessons to be learned from Chun's teachings.But the second half of the film is particularly uninteresting. Unfortunately the director or producer(s) chose to focus more on Kate Mulgrew's character and the scandal that is brewing with a major defense contractor. It just really doesn't work.But I always catch the first half of the film whenever it's on.
4,Fred Ward is the man.,"I have a big crush on Fred Ward and since the Remo Williams/The Destroyer books were my favorite when I was a teen, I had to see this movie. Its cheesy, but its fun. I wish it were on TV more often."
3,The Adventure Begins,"I like the premise of this movie being that a man's death is faked so that a top secret agency can give him a new identity and arm this person with new skills to take out the enemy... It is fun to see Fred Ward's Character undergo such a change and through these changes & training become a ""secret weapon"" to help with both domestic and foreign affairs....However, this movie doesn't stand up well against the test of time. It is very dated & filled with all of the 1980's cliches, bad music, cheesy bad guys and various other stereotypes galore! Some of the humor and action were fun to watch and some of it was silly is an understatement.The best part of ""Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins"" is Joel Grey's portrayal of Chiun. Chiun is a Korean master of fighting hired to teach Remo Williams to become a lethal weapon. The interactions between Chiun & Remo Williams are often funny and charming. The rest of the movie overall was trite."
3,Student Level Material,"This material states that it is advanced but I found that all these techniques were taught in school for the State of Washington Massage education.I recommend it to any student of massage therapy for a reference while learning myofascial release.It may be possible that states that require only a low level of education may find this useful for continuing education.I will list the techniques so you can decide if this manual would benefit you or not.Techniques include:MFR for:paraspinalslevator scapulaesuboccipital, temporalis and scalp fasciasubclaviusSOD (suboccipital decompression technique)steranl fasciaintercostalstrapeziusscalenessternal notchmandible"
2,"Why, yes, we do hate your music...","...because D.R.I. did it back in 1987. And they did it better (although with thinner production). To hear a band ranting about other bands ripping off a scene that they love, when they are in fact merely off the same scene is pretty damn sad.""What I really hate is music like yours, makes me wanna smash your head through a door..."" - Who's music? We don't know, but I'm guessing that it's the music of all of the ""fake"" hardcore bands out there. Doesn't really matter because it's kind of a [...]lyric, anyway.Sworn Enemy try to combine the ferocity of metal with the passion of hardcore. The problem is that they are missing both the passion and the ferocity. They are loud, though."
5,Obedience solutions for your dog,"How often have we wished someone successful would show us the ropes? With Ross Allans Dog Training it's easy to tap into the experience and hard work that often take years and years to accumulate. The efforts of Ross Allan in this book show simple straight forward techniques on how to avoid and correct the problems most of us experience with our dogs every single day. I had a bit of a stint working as a Dog Handler in the South African military. Now I work for Guide Dogs Queensland Australia. To see Ross work with his dog ""The Cisco kid"" was something harmonious. Kind of what we all strive for in our relationship with our companions. Give it a read, and pick up the phone... the author is a nice guy too."
2,Finally the truth,This book has some great insights into the frauds put out to the public. It also gives the reasons why trusted people would deliberatey deceive the public.
5,Left Out--The Truth Shall Make You Flee,"Looking for a well written, concise, documented expose of leftist-liberal political/social/historical/academic prevarications over the last century. Look no further. This is the book. It deserves a Pulitzer Prize. It drives a stake through the rotten and dishonest heart of so called ""progressive"" ideology of the so called ""intellectual elites""."
2,"He's a hoodwinker, all right...","Potential readers should know that Jack Cashill knows more about hoodwinking than he lets on. In 2002, Cashill wrote a seven-part series for the conservative website WorldNetDaily purporting to prove the innocence of anti-abortion extremist James Kopp in the murder of abortion provider Barnett Slepian. A few months later, however, Kopp pleaded guilty to killing Slepian, discrediting the series. Such determination to push an agenda in spite of the facts should be a warning of what to expect in Cashill's book."
3,IF you buy this book you are indeed hoodwinked,"This guy is so intent on disproving leftist theories, that he actually misstates the facts. It was never proven, that Bartomelo Vanzetti had Allasendro Beredialli's (the guards) gun. It was however widely known that Berdeilli's widow cried: ""If only he had brought his gun that day!""THe fact is that Cashill did not do his homework and makes unfair and inaccurate statments."
1,Caveat Emptor,"I first came across this book when I checked out Amazon's Bestsellers List for something to read. It was in 24th positin, but the Details page for the book said it was number 572. I re-loaded the page several times, and the Details page corrected to #24. Next day it was #27. Today it is #171. Three days: stellar rise, precipitous drop.The book carried a five star reader rating, but it was on the basis of four readers.The book has not been reviewed in any general-readership publication that I could find. The few reviews I could find appeared in publications having some relationship with the author (his publisher, ideological oublication where his pieces appear). Every one of these reviews refers to the author as an Emmy-winning director, but searching the Emmy website does not produce any hits on his name."
1,In a word: BORING!!!,"This reader cannot easily recall the last time he encountered such a cumbersome work of tripe. This book is easily the most tiresomely and trite diatribe of the year. Save yourself some money and go watch mold growing. There is neither anything new in the way of rhetoric, illuminating in the way of ""information"", or enlightening in the way of political philosophy. It's another one of those works where you'll be slapping your head wondering a. why did you buy this? and b. can I use it as a doorstop? This is fringe reading at best for those who are unable to spend their time more productively."
3,"A Journey of Hoaxes from Alex Haley to Walter Duranty, Cashill Helps One Become Re-Educated","Mr. Cashill takes you on an intellectual ride of hoaxes and misdirection as played out in famously falsified books and news articles submitted by political ideologues and some just plan out liars. Some of the stories of the '30s about Walter Duranty and his false reports for the New York Times on the Russian brutality, I was privileged to learn in school. However, others were quite revealing and some were complete shocks. I guess this craving to promote and for falsities does not come as a complete surprise, as even Ophra has now been publicly duped with one of her book club entries. I pays to ask why, then why again, in our endeavors to become educated. Reading Mr. Cashill's expose will move you along that path to correct some of your false realities as he has mine."
4,An 8 Track Tape Full Of Memories,"This Album is really great, I remember listening to 8 track tapes as a kid at my brothers house and hearing some of the best music NOT in his collection. The 8 tracks were made by his friend, who insisted they didn't buy the same albums. Anyway, On an 8 Track titled Rock Ballad, there were 3 great songs from this album (rock ballad, drive all night, anastasia) If you like mid '70's songwriters, do not miss this album, or Night Lights, Some really inspired Springsteen-ish stuff. Buy it now"
4,it's not all bad,"I enjoyed the book, the writing was excelent and it kept my interest. But i must admit i didn't see one redeaming quality that would encourage me to join that sorority. I am very pro sorority, I am a member of a BGLO, but that mess was just an excersize in all that can go wrong if you choose to make up a process as you go along. The whole idea of sisterhood was lost in the group, service seemed to be just an after thought. I am so sorry for any female who had that experience as their sorority life. I had fun made true friend and do feel like i can connect with any chapter of my sorors. No you will not be best friends with all the members but it seems to me that she did not connect with any of the members. I can go on for days about just how much the book rubbed me the wrong way. To each their own I just did not get it."
3,Interesting Spin on Black Greek Life,It's a quick read for anyone interested in Black Sorority Life. It would provide an interesting discussion on the dangers of hazing and how young women can get swept up in the glamour of joining an organization and put their lives and educational/professional futures at risk. It did end abruptly not to mention there are a few grammatical errors.
1,Leaves a lot to be desired...,"Am I the only one who thought this book was no good? I thought the book was written for a second grade reading level, I found several grammatical mistakes as well... did she publish this in her basement? It is clear that the author had no perception of real greek life and did no research for this book. The things she insinuated and wrote about were ludicrous and dumb. I'm not sure where she obtained the vague information she did have, but it was not from a good source!"
4,"Good, well made","Very solidly built, like all the products from Nature's Instinct. I have nearly every foraging toy they make, and a Harlequin Macaw to test them!I do wish they made a larger version; something big enough to use a unshelled peanut, the largest thing that I can fit in it is an almond- but a clever, good looking and sell designed toy."
3,Can't mount on cage with screws provided.,"This toy comes with a way to hang it from a chain and supposedly a way to fasten it to the cage. The inner section is rotated but I don't see any way a bird can rotate that when it's hanging.I say this is supposedly designed to hang on the cage which is the only way I can see a bird rotating the center, but I don't see any way it can actually mount to the cage. There is a picture on Amazon of it mounted to the cage, but it only shows the front. If you go here [...] they have a short video with it mounted to the bars. Unfortunately there are only 2 screws included, you need 4) and the screws that come with the toy are too short. A trip to the hardware store should take care of that.Apparently Amazon doesn't allow urls in reviews. So if you go to Caitec dot com and do a search on Zig Zag you'll find the item. There's a video in the description."
2,Not their best,"Spirals, while not as bad as the awful 'Paper Monkeys' was when the Ozrics as a band started to fall apart. While I can't say I loved every song on previous albums, I certain liked at least 1/2 the album. With this album I only liked 2 songs.Having seen them live twice last year, I also don't think that the current Ozric line up is that good. I remember seeing them 2 nights in a row back in the mid 90s and being blown away by how different they were. The current line up just don't improvise much and everything seems far too rehearsed. I want the 2nd show to sound different and yet the only person who really improvises is the guitarist. That never used to be the case. They also are relying far too much on the old 'hits', yet they don't play those hits anywhere near as good as they used to. Will the magic every return? Time will tell, though I fear not with the current line up."
4,Best production to date,"I would have to say that 'Spirals' has the best sound of any Ozric CD, with their previous ""Hidden Step"" a close second. But the sound of the cd is immaculate. I only give it four stars because a couple of the later tracks on the CD seem to wander a bit and are a little simplistic imho. But that said, the opener ""Chewier"" is such a fine piece of work I can forgive the occasional aimlessness on some of the songs. This may be due to the synth-bass on most of the tunes now that ZIA is regrettably out of the picture aside from Oakum on this current CD. I guess I like a ""real person playin' bass"" than a machine. But this lp still kicks but and I love it!"
5,League of its Own,"Impossible to describe with words the breadth and beauty of these 9 songs, and the fantastic mental and emotional journeys they take you through. The Ozrics are not only technical masters of their instruments, but also creative genii of brilliantly imaginative and atypical soundscapes and rhythms - a deadly and extremely rare combination.My first Ozric experience; certainly not my last."
5,BREATHTAKING SUSPENSE,"Perhaps one of the best books of all time, I was so impressed I read it again, and bought my girlfriend a copy to read on a flight to the states... its not horror but it will make you jump... its not suspense but it will keep you hanging... its not romance but you will fall in love with the plot... all in all a right riveting read"
1,Sick horror,"Personally I think Laymond is a quite strange author, and Funland is no exeption. He has got a good imagination, writes well and is an excellent story teller. Then he destroys it with sickening violence. Funland has got some of the most disturbing violence scenes I have ever read. Sickening in fact. What is the point ? In my opinion good horror lies in the sublime. For slasher fans this is proberbly great. If you belong in my camp, stay clear."
4,Good Laymon Fun,"""Funhouse"" is a little different from other Laymon books. Less sex and violence. But he tells a great story with rich character development. This book compares more to ""Traveling Vampire Show"" than to ""Island"". He does a wonderful job of slowly building the tension and anticipation to set you up for the final 100 pages. I definitely recommend this book. But, if you want real hard core Laymon read ""After Midnight"", ""Island"", the Beast House series or ""Come Out Tonight""."
3,Passable,"Well written, but I found the story itself lacking, a bit slow in the first half or so. Decent overall."
3,It's ok,The book had an interesting plot. This was my 1st Laymon read and I would definately be inerested in readng more of his stuff.
4,Interesting,"Good book, it was strange and uncomfortable at times but over all good read. Glad it's only a fictional book!"
3,Just Plain Fun,"A nice little romp on the boardwalk. If you do not mind a bit of herky jerk action as the adventure flips from character to character, and a couple of pointless interludes between the two cop characters, you will be in for quite a treat once the whole cast converges on Funland for an epic showdown."
3,Not his best...but not the worst.,"I've read several of his books and this is by far the least exciting. This book didn't really pick up until about 85% through the book and then it was short and sweet. The book was never boring but I felt myself eagerly reading just to get to the good parts, which were few and far between. And in all...it was okay, at best."
4,A definite read,If you're a Laymon fan then read this book. Of all the Laymon books I have read this has to have been my favorite so far. It will be hard to top it. His storytelling skills keep you on edge and his characters jump off the page at you. This book is worth the read!
3,"Its Laymon, but not at his best.","I will start by saying I am a huge Laymon fan, and have read the majority of the books that have been released over the years. This book was one that I am glad I picked up, but there were just some issues I had with it overall. Laymon is always showing us characters who make poor decisions and have to live with the consequences, but some of the decisions that these people make are completley ridiculous.The ending sequence is fairly ludicrous as well, and you pretty much knew who was going to make it out without having to get to the final page.All that said, I enjoyed the book, and read it in just a couple days, but if you are just starting out with Laymon I would recommend the Beast House books, or Traveling Vampire Show, or something like that first."
1,Not the product for me!,I am sure that there are a lot of people out there that this smells nice on. But as you know every scent reacts differently on everyone and this scent does nothing for me. I will not buy it agian.
5,Claiborne By Liz Claiborne For Men. Cologne Spray 3.4 Ounces,"A classic scent. I hope they never stop making this one. Ladies ask me to wear it when we go out. One asked for a hand kerchief sprayed with it, and put in an airtight container so she could keep it.It is not oily at all, and can be used as an aftershave if you like.It is light enough that you really cannot overuse it, even with several sprays."
1,fake cologne,this is fake cologne. real claiborne has the info on the bottom of bottel.this is being ship to a place in new york.water down do not buy from amazon.com till they stop selling fake things. only one star becouse they make you put something dowm.
5,GREAT SERVICE!,"It was a return trip for me to order this product. I am blown away by how easy to order, how great the pricing is, how fabulous the cologne itself is and most especially, how FAST my order arrives! You guys rock, keep up the good work!"
4,Very pleased,I have enjoyed reading and using this commentary in study. Good item for anyone study Colossians. I think it is a benefit
5,Absolutely amazing!,"I watched them live, I met them backstage and they're great! Apart from being a really cool bunch of guys, they play excellent music too. Being a avid Alphaville fan, it comes as no surprise that I would rate this live album so highly. A bit different from their actual CD music but never the less a really different experience. For all it's worth, I never take this one out of my car..."
5,An Outstanding Album....!,"I have been a devoted fan of Alphaville since they began and must say that it is a treat to have all favourites together on one album. I agree with Adrian Ramundo that the best track on this album is without a doubt the hidden track (no 12). Overall the fact that this is a live performance captured on CD, rather than a studio-recording is testament that Alphaville is all about raw talent and brilliance! The lyrics are all captivating and deep. Each song has a melody, unlike mainstream music of today. This CD is one that never leaves my car and I never get tired of playing this album, over and over again. Just buy it - you will never regret it!"
1,Just Get On And Do Another Studio Album,"I am an Alphaville fan but just found this to be a re-hashing of old material. This band already has two 'best of' albums and should concentrate on new material rather than a live album. If their hearts were truly in this project they would have performed many more songs, they have such a large catelogue to choose from. If Depeche Mode could do a double CD after only 6 years, why can't Alphaville after all this time?"
4,Nice!,"CGA-DU21 works as advertised, Charges pretty quicky using the Panasonic Charger that came along with PV-GS80 Camcorder.PROS:(+) Cheap when compared to Panasonic's original battery(+) Greatly improves the Battery life when compared to included battery with the panasonic camcorders(+) 2200mAH capacity extends battery life considerably.CONS:(-) Slightly big, Depending on the camcorder model, you may find the color not matching the camcorder's body color.I have yet to encounter a situation wherein using this battery on a PV-GS80 have disappointed me to see my battery being drained out dead."
1,"Nope, nothing...","From the reviews, it seems like these work well for some people. I guess I just wasn't lucky enough to be one of them. After less than a year and two or three charges, it does not power the camera and refuses to charge at all. Just a warning to anyone who's thinking about buying one, there's no guarantee that it will work properly."
4,Good battery for the price,"Much longer life than the standard battery on my PV-GS250. Build quality isn't as good as the Panasonic brand, but it works and that is the most important part."
1,Not a Sakar (Digital Concept) Battey,Some sellers (Deals Direct) sell it as a no-brand (literally) battery. Ordered one - DOA. They replaced it with another one - broken connector. Seems they sell the batteries that did not pass Chineese Quality Control. Thanks to Amazon I got my money back.
5,Excellant choice for the price,I bought this battery for my PV-GS320 camcorder. I was little worried about the 7.4 volt specification of this battery compared to the 7.2 volt of the original panasonic battery came with the camcorder. But this one works well with my camcorder. A great value for $20 when comparing the price/performance with the original panasonic battery costing $75.
3,Disappointed but okay,This battery ended up being the wrong one but the return process has been painless. Deals Direct has been very helpful and easy to deal with.
1,Brittle. Broke effortlessly.,The little plastic tracks that hold the battery in place broke in less than 10 uses. Now I have to hold the battery in place if I need to use it as a backup.The original shorter life Panasonic battery has never broken in dozens of uses. Nor has the the other long life Panasonic battery that I purchased to replace this cheap imitation.Complete Waste of Money(underline).
5,Double power at half the price of the name brand!,I bought two of these for the same price as the original. And the original was only half the amp-hour rating. It's a great value if they remain servicable several years! Fast delivery and well packaged.
5,BP-DU21,"I was worried that the price of this battery is what I would get...cheap. Not so. This battery is a bit bulky (see pictures), but for extended life it's the only thing to expect and this battery is awesome. It has given me probably more than 3 hours of record time. I bought it for my JVC camcorder. I would buy this battery again in a heartbeat."
4,Does what it should do!,I bought this battery for my PV-GS200 camcorder. Takes about 8 hours to charge completely and lasts for about 3 to 4 hours of intermittent shooting. Fits well for my requirement. I have no complaints except that it looks light gray (doesn't go well with my camcorder's body color) and feels somewhat plastic and low quality. A great value for $20.
1,Junk!,"Fully charged battery overnight, installed it on my PV-GS320, and...NOTHING.It does not work. Total waste of money."
2,Good deal? Not necessarily.,"What I assumed I was buying was a longer life battery, as advertised. What I got was a large battery lasts no longer than the smaller, standard battery that came with my camcorder. I totally discharged and recharged the it several times, but the results were the same. From that standpoint, it's not worth the purchase.I'd prefer standard life performance in a less bulky package."
3,New Subscriber,"I have enjoyed the first two issues. I was hoping to find more articles about actually traveling, but there seems to be more advertising than information. It is a good publication. I don't know if I will be continue the subscription when it expires. It just isn't what I expected."
2,Outdated,"This book was undoubtedly of great use to fledgling societies when it was written. However, 20 years later, it is dated beyond belief. Better advice is found on the 'net, for free."
5,My absolute FAVOTITE!,"""Hose of Whispers"" is my Favorite Saga. I tis so mysterious in AMny ways. It is a MUST-READ! ~Anna"
3,Predictable but entertaining,"Like all the books in the Fear Street Sagas, this one is predictable, but that does not mean it isn't an interesting read. Amy Pierce is visiting her Aunt Angelica (Simon is not in this book at all) and her cousins (Julia, Hannah, Robert, Brandon and Joseph) while her mother tends to her father who was injured in the war. The book gets right into the evil in the beginning, when Angelica shows Amy that she too has special powers. After that there are the usual 36 deaths (all gory). If you wanted to read more about Angelica and her family, then you might want to read this one."
5,A great country blues torch singer from the 20's...,"The best of her genere, Lucille Hegiman was the best of the country blues torch singers of the 20's. She was often backed by some of the best jazzmen of the 20's. This cd comes highly recommeded especially if you like Bessie Smith, Victoria Spivey, Sippie Wallace, and so on..."
4,It makes you think,"The Unquiet Grave smells of the mannered ways of the English Middle Class before WW2. It has a certain pretentiousness which will repel some but open doors for others. It consists of paragraphs each of which contain a thought culled mostly from the wisdom literature of the last 3 millennia. Not all these thoughts are attributed, so some are presumably those of the author. They do, however, hang together well and may spark a high rate of response in their reader. Connolly does seem to reflect the anxious yearning for direction and certainty which infects many. Those people who current wisdom says should be secure in our modern world but who feel anything but secure will find the book reflecting their uncertainties. It will strike more chords in California than Bosnia, and some of the chords will be life enhancing."
1,The author of this book should have been shot,"It is difficult, though not quite impossible, to understand why this tedious piece of self-abuse should still be in print, and selling, after 60 years -- or indeed, why it was ever printed.'The Unquiet Grave' represents the final degradation of an idea that started out without merit, that the feeling artist is the moral arbiter of his society.Fans think Connolly deep. 'Strewth, he was so shallow that he couldn't assign any greater significance to a world war with naziism than that it interfered with his contemplation of the beautiful task of being Cyril Connolly.In any righteous age, he would have been disposed of as useless mouth when worthier people were dying of hunger."
2,Not what I ordered,"Beware, I ordered these and received what appears to be counterfeit generic unlabeled linens of inferior quality, if the deep discount wasn't hint enough! I'm attempting to return them, but its not as easy as it should be."
3,Teardrop Pals Breast Enhancers,Seller delivered item quickly. By product description I was led to believe these were bigger than they actually are. For the cost I was disappointed. Quality of the product itself is good. Works well in a padded bra or padded cup swim suit. Just not the size I was expecting. I'll do my research better next time.
3,Note: Only 22 pages on the Black Dahlia,"Here on Amazon this book is called ""LAPD Rogue Cops: Black Dahlia Murder Case"" leading me to believe this book was about the Dahlia case. But when the book arrived, I was surprised to see the title was actually ""LAPD's Rogue Cops: Cover Ups and the Cookie Jar."" This book is about LAPD corruption across a wide period of time with only two chapters (22 pages total) about the Black Dahlia. What's contained in these chapters is interesting (most of the information appears in the new book THE BLACK DAHLIA FILES by Donald H. Wolf) and I'm sure this book is a worthy read, but don't be fooled like I was into thinking this is a book just about the Black Dahlia case."
3,Not Enough of Eva's Friends!,"In the liner notes it makes reference to two other CDs that include Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet. These two CDs seem to be unavailable. I blame Document Records for teasing me into thinking I could have all of Eva's great records instead of this tiny group, which only gives a hint of what she could do."
4,WOW! Sophisticated and relaxing!,"I was at a music store in, of all places, Dubai in the UAE. This very cool music came on and I HAD to find out what it was...Hotel Costes vol. 1 !!! Can't wait to get the rest of the series, including the DJ's new solo effort!"
2,Fair,Is not the type of music I was looking for! I thought it would have more of a Parisian tone. It did not live up to my expectations.
2,Not worth listening unless you're collecting,"I purchased Hotel Costes backwards from 6,5,4 and then 2. I don't know why I skipped 3 and bought 2 first. But 3 and 1 isn't worth listening to, unless you want the whole collection of the Hotel Costes series."
4,a mix like taking a euro trip...,"I love compilations, when they are good that is, and this one is one of the best I've found in a while. Every song continues and develops the mood that the first track begins. Usually there is a dud in the mix somewhere but not in this case. Each track, and you may have several of these tracks from other compilations or other disc (like De Phazz, or Grace Jones), is a gem on its own. Reading the brief liner notes from Milla Jovovich, and looking at the photos of the Hotel Costes while listening sets quite a nice mood for an after work trip away from it all."
5,MUST HAVE!,I love Costes album. I collect all the album from 1 to the latest. It's really niceeeeee....
2,disappointing,"I purchased this book for my 10 year old son as a basis for discussion for 'the talk'. I found the information provided therein deficient in several categories. There are actually only a couple pages that are devoted to any kind of description or explanation of the sex act itself, and those are non-illustrated and very shallow. The book is much more geared to describing male and female changes during puberty and of course, as a publication of Planned Parenthood, spends considerable time on contraception, STDs, and other topics which are not perhaps reflected in the book's misleading title. I would have returned the book but the return shipping fee would not have justified that process as it would have been more than one-half the cost of the book itself. I would recommend against this book for any purpose."
3,Good Start,"I ordered this book to have ""the talk"" with my daughter. Some parts were WAY over her head at the age of 9, but it's good because it talks about changes in the body and what she might be feeling. It's got a section for males and females, so we obviously skipped the male part for the time being. We will go back and review in a year or so, but do not recommend for under the age of 9."
1,ICC A complete Bible Commentary in Eight Volumes for the General Reader,Never received item and emailed multiple times with no reply. Would not buy from this seller again
2,not a good value,"I was very disappointed in this video. It touched on the basics,but fell short on the in-depth material. The video didn't touch on geocaching or other in-depth features. The garmin free videos are more informative. I would not recommend this to a friend."
1,Redington takes a left turn to nowhere,"Listening to this CD is ok if you are waiting in the dental office to have your root canal done, it is not offensive but it lacks any punch to call it great. Destiny lacks high points and the lingering absence of musical direction leaves you in limbo. Rick's more admirable work can be heard with his former band mates ""The Huge Members"". With the loss of their bass player and a team collaboration with them, the effort is like Robby Krieger without Jim, John and Jay."
1,"Cheap, Plastic...",I bought this because I was traveling through Europe and didn't want to bring a good watch.It barely made it through my 8 week trip.
1,Not 60X,"The description says 60X but the cards I received does not mention the speed. When I tried to read or write to the card with some sample files, it was around 2.25/3.3 MB/sec. 60X is 10MB/sec. It should have been at least 8 or 9 MB/sec"
4,Vintage White In a Variety of Settings,"Document Records produces some of the most historically important recordings on the market -- often obsure numbers of siginifcant value to musicians and genre affcianados. However, the average consumer always has to be at least a little careful, as is the case with this offering.Of the songs on this CD, only 4 are pure Josh White vocal and solo guitar. The remainder feature him in trio and band settings. The songs are great, but it's not what most people would expect. A little more clarification on the label would go a long way in this case.The White solo efforts are the highlight of this offering. Uncle Sam Says and Bad Housing Blues are extremely progressive civil rights songs for the era.Note that many of these tracks were gleaned from rare old recordings, the sound quality is predictably uneven, but perfectly within the standards for this type of compilation."
4,Lynn,This ring is unique and beautiful. I've received a lot of compliments on it and have referred people to Silver Insanity.
2,Not as pretty on as in the picture,"I am disappointed in the way this ring looks when it is actually on a finger...It is VERY wide and the particular ring I got (I believe they are all different) looks crude and amateurish, with gaping ""holes"" in the wirework. That said, when twisted the right way the ring is surprisingly comfortable and I think the ring could look very striking on someone with very long, very slender fingers. I am planning on wiring stone beads into the gaps of the ring and giving it to my daughter, whose fingers are more suited to the style...we shall see what she thinks of it!"
1,Dont Buy it,"Although the picture shows a cute looking ring this ring isn't pretty. The fringed look, only looks like the ring has been left on the floor and someone ran it over with a vaccum cleaner."
3,Pretty but not practical,"I had wanted this ring for a while because of its interesting look, and I finally got one recently. Well, I'm sending it back and exchanging for something else. While this ring is beautiful and large and fun, I didn't realize how much it would bother me wearing it. I was hoping for something I could wear every day, and this is definitely not an every day piece. It snags, it hinders my finger's mobility when I put it on due to its largeness, it kind of irritates me because some parts of it poke my skin, and it's soft metal. It reminds me of strings of solder or just really thin silver wire. I love Silver Insanity's products, but I don't like this ring enough to keep it.But thanks to Silver Insanity for letting me exchange and making it such an easy process."
4,beautiful but hard to keep clean,I love this ring because it is so unique and people always have good comments to give me about it. My only complaint is that the ring is hard to keep clean. It will get tarnished (as all silver does) in the nooks and crannies which can be a pain. But I love this ring despite that!
3,"Attractive, but very fragile","Nice ring, but very fragile. Part of it broke the first time I used it."
3,"Nice looking ring, just uncomfortable.","It's a beautiful ring, but extremely uncomfortable to wear. Possibly if I had a little larger size it might make a difference. Not sure...."
3,Very pretty,"The ring is very pretty, but the odd shape of it doesnt allow the ring to keep its shape. The ring was also about half a size too small for the size it was supposed to be."
3,rings,"the product is nice, however the sizes are smaller than a ring of that size should be. Also the filigree tends to snag on clothing and other surfaces."
2,painful!,"Pretty but painful to wear! Knobby & the same width all around, jams into the other fingers! But it IS really pretty & noticable!! SO I'll suffer!"
2,Lovely -- but.....,"This is a pretty ring, but it is uncomfortable. The sizing is a little on the small side, but the width of the band is uncomfortable on my finger."
2,not happy,it is pretty but the size is off. ordered a 10 but it does not fit. it is more like a 8 or 9.
4,Very nice,"Love the ring! It's certainly unique, and many people have complimented on it. For the sizing of the ring, I used Amazon's ring guide and it fits perfectly. It does on occasion snag my clothes, so I have to be careful when I wear it. Overall, I'm very pleased with it!"
4,beautiful!!,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received this ring. I wasn't expecting much but it's quite sturdy. It's a conversation piece and when a friend of mine saw it, she immediately ordered one for herself. Since they are all originals, you have to expect some imperfections but it truly is a beautiful ring. GREAT price!!"
1,waiting for them to respond to my e-mail,I ordered the wrong size - mailed it back to them and am still waiting for them to respond via e-mail.... I won't re-rate this ring until they send me the correct size.... I gave one star b/c the ring was nice. But I don't have anything right now....
5,A gift for myself,The ring has a wonderful appearance that catches everyone's eye. The sizes are true and I know I will have year's of enjoyment wearing the ring.
3,Would love to give it 5 stars,"I really would love to give it 5 stars. The only reason I am not is because I too have clumps and some of the design isn't as pretty as the picture. One of the clumps is a little pointy and it irritates my finger. I've just had to learn to ignore it and if I twist it just right it isn't that bad. I do this because I do love the ring. It sounds crazy to do all that, but I love it that much! I get compliments on it too. SO...I really want to give it 5 stars but can't because I feel I didn't get the ""best one"" in the bunch."
3,Pretty but not exactly comfortable,"Very pretty ring and I love the way it looks. The only issue I've had so far is that it is uncomfortable when you bend your fingers due to the wire design, there are many wavy points on the edges of the band that dig into your fingers when your fingers are bent. I will definitely wear this on special occasions but not for everyday wear."
2,"beautiful, but not practical","This ring is Beautiful and artistic, however, after wearing it off and on for about a week, one of the wire split, leaving two sharp ends exposed. i tried to sorta 'bend' them into the design, where they wouldn't be dangerous or noticable; but it just didn't work. after braving the danger, another wire or two broke.i'd say i put medium wear on my jewelry and i realize this is somewhat fragile, but i definately expected more from it and was disappointed. Now i'm not sure WHAT to do with it.I'd think twice unless you have a super-cushy job that doesn't require getting your hands dirty or frequent washing. DEFINATELY not a ring for a mom!!!"
2,Silver filigree ring,"I was disappointed with the quality of this ring. It's very feminine but cheaply thrown together... looks like something a child made. If it were of a better quality, this would be a beautiful ring. Some of the wire work is scrunched together and clumped, not like its pictured. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,"Great design, sizing not true to size","A great ring at a great price, but the sizing seems to be smaller than the standard ring sizing. I ordered my usual size and it was too small. When I compared it to my other rings it was easy to see that it was smaller than rings of the same size. Customer service was accessible and the exchange was easy but not terribly speedy."
2,"lovely to look at, uncomfortable to wear","I purchased this item based on it's rave reviews and different look. It is lovely and very different from other rings I have purchased. It is also horribly uncomfortable. There are pieces that cut into my fingers because they are sharp and unfinished. After an hour of wearing, I am dying to take it off and my skin is irritated. Now it is a lovely adornment for my jewelery box and not much else. :("
3,Unique Filigree Wirework Wide Band Sterling Silver Ring,"Unique Filigree Wirework Wide Band Sterling Silver RingI ordered two of these, the first order was perfect, so perfect my granddaughter got it. The second was less, had some areas that would snag. Sizing was not a problem.Thank you"
4,attention getting,Everyone at work loves the ring and my customers ask where I got it all the time... it's unusual and fun!
2,"Looks Nice, But Tarnished and Didn't Fit Properly","I received lots of compliments on this unique ring. But, the trouble that I've had getting just the right fit after resizing and keeping the ring from tarnishing makes it hard for me to recommend."
3,"Interesting, but cheap looking","It is a really funky and fun piece of jewelery, but in real life it looks like something I could have bought at a jewelry dispenser"
5,Changed the climate in our household,"I saw Chick Moorman speak about Parent Talk and ultimately read the book at a time when I needed some guidance on parenting a 4 year old. I shared Chick's feelings of respect and responsibility for my son, but didn't know how to phrase these concepts ""in the heat of the moment"". This book taught me the way to say what I want my child to hear - that I love him and respect him and that I want to teach him to be responsible for his actions.Each page is an example you can put into use immediately. It's common sense all good parents have been searching for.I have recommended this book to ever parent I know."
2,Low budget film,Nothing special about this film. The narration is about Jamaica.The girls were average and the clothing they wore had holes. Adefinate low budget film.
5,Extra Long Cat 5 Patch Cable,I needed an extra long cable to set up a new computer and prepare it for wireless internet access. This cable served the purpose. It was very good quality and the price was great.
1,Worthless,I bought this to have a hardline from my router to my laptop for faster speed. It seemed like the signal didn't even flow through the cord. Waste of money.
4,Received gray cable instead of blue,"This product is described as a blue ethernet cable. The cable was delivered, but it was actually gray instead of blue. Its sometimes a little hard to insert and remove the cable, but it does the job."
5,Works great,"Works fast, good connection. Long cable is convenient for larger spaces. I had mine connected to my xbox for xbox live, works well. Good buy."
1,started losing connection after a while,"I bought two of these ethernet cables. Each one started having spotty connection after a few weeks of using them. Connection would be fine, then lost for a second then back. This is just frustrating for a computer user but is a killer for a gamer! Do not buy if you're looking for something reliable and durable."
1,Does not function,As the review title states--it does not function. I know for a fact that it's not an issue on the modem's end or my computer since they work with another cable.
3,Was OK,The package arrived quickly. Does not state anywhere that it's a Cat5e only that it's a Cat5. A tab broke off when I plugged it into my modem and it basically lives there now. I have to use needle nose pliers to get it out. Seems to work fine though.
1,Ummmm,"Yes it is a functioning, blue, 25 ft ethernet cord. The problem? Trying to unplug the cord is nearly impossible. The plastic sheath over the tab that would allow you to remove the cord is too rough, and doesn't even help unplug the cord. It in fact makes it harder to unplug. The tab itself hurts to unplug. You will spend at least 5 minutes and use some lego pieces in order to try to free the plug.I asked to return it and they require me to pay for the return. I paid $3.44 for this product, and to ship it back costs $3.50. So...yeah.Don't buy this if you ever plan on moving or unplugging it from the modem ever."
5,Very Good,"Seller did a great job sending this to me, took only 5 days, cable works great for what i'm using it for (Xbox360). I would defiantly buy from this seller againSeller was Bargaincells"
2,Misleading Picture (does not have protective clip sleeve),"While this is a nice cable and a good price, the pictures that Amazon posts (as of 12/11/2009) clearly show the proctective, anti-snag sleeves over the clip. This cable DOES NOT have those sleeves on it.Since this cable will be run through walls and 80% of the time, sleeveless cables must be replaced, I feel that this was a poor purchase. Amazon needs to update their images and verify them and/or the seller needs to provide the correct pictures to Amazon. In either case, I feel cheated but the cable isn't worth the hassle of returning.As far as a Cat5e patch cable, though, it does work as expected."
5,Good ethernet cable,Great price. The cable was just as advertised. What else can you say about cable?
4,mm well is ok,"yeah this cable was cheap and shipped pretty fast.however it does appear to be rather mediocre as for quality ""lower than Belkin"" who are the self proclaimed 1# in cables at least USB.the cable thickness and shielding seem very thin not sure how important that is but hey.also it shipped in shrinkwrap not to be pickey but if you plan to resell this beware."
2,Cable is super cheap,The cable seems descent in the beginning but stiffens out and permanently curls. I don't recommend.
4,Great Range bag,"This range bag is well made with plenty of room for all your shooting supplies, pistols, magazines and targets. Very High quality."
2,Small!,"Shirt was way too small. Arm hole loops seemed almost so short that a child couldn't even wear this. I don't even think a large would fit a petite woman. like the logo. had to return the shirt, unusable."
1,"Over simplified, inaccurate.","This is a ""la la"" book, avoiding any controversy and telling theintricate story of Spain. I was taking a trip to Spain and alwaysstudy the history of where I'm going, and this was the first oneI downloaded. It was over simplified, inaccurate, lacking in substance.I did find a scholarly book that dealt with the history and it's worth itto learn the real story."
2,two books,"there are two books in this one. The first should be titled ""the story of john michael talbot"", which I really enjoyed. The other book should be titled ""why you should become a catholic and move to a monastry"", which I did not enjoy. Its not that I'm opposed to being catholic or JMT's conversion. I enjoyed the first half because it was about his life and I really enjoy good bio. of people I admire and respect. I just got booged down in all the explanation about how and why he became a catholic. A little of that goes a long way! So I recommend the book very much. I give the first half a 5 star. Its worth reading if your like me and love his music and the man. Just bear in mind that the second half is boreing!But is worth buying just for the first half."
5,The thingamajig got lost in the Wall Street Shuffle.,"I have long admired the innovative music of 10CC. When I first heard this vinyl recording, I couldn't believe the unique lyrics, musicanship, and down right hummable tunes. All there work is stellar. This may be the best debut album ever. It is more than ""I'm not in Love""; their only hit in the states. Pity that they broke up into separate projects, I prefer the Godley&Creme recordings. Do yourself a favor and BUY this and all their work, while they are still available. They are the thinking man's R&R band."
3,Incomplete,"I am bothered by the claim on the cover stating ""... a COMPLETE and illustrated history of ALL the electric guitars ever manufactured by Gibson Inc.""Although the first edition is copywrited in 1981, it fails to mention anything about the SG production models (excluding unrelated Les Paul versions)produced from the early '60's or lesser known models like the solid body 335-S (not to be confused with the ES-335)produced in the Norlin years (very early '80's).There is a great deal of information on the the early acoustic/electrics, the Les Pauls and the ES series instruments which makes it valuable, but it can hardly be called complete."
2,Not as good as the first one,"I devoured the first book in this series so I was very excited to read the second one. It did not live up to my expectations at all. The story dragged on and only got in the last 30 page or so. Not my favorite, a let down."
3,"not nearly as good as peeps, but still a good read.","I really liked Peeps. I wish this sequel was more a a sequel. This book could have stood alone without being called a sequel because the original characters only made a tiny appearance. I got lost in all the descriptions of the music, but maybe that is because I am an old lady at 26, and I don't understand the new generations choice of music. But the book was a good read, it was quick, not really suspenseful, but the characters were enjoyable."
3,Westerfield's done it again,"HE's done it again. Creating a brilliant fast paced sequal to Peeps. The only down side was the story is about a completely different set of characters. The bonding that we formed for the original characters of Peeps was touch on ever so briefly twice in the story. I found it hard to enjoy these characters as much as those of Peeps and other Westerfield Novels. The story was great, and the ending resolved all problems presented. All and all a fun read."
3,As a sequel - Disappointing,"While this is the sequel to Peeps, Cal and Lace do not make an appearance until more than halfway through the book. This book focuses on the interactions of five people who become members of a band and each chapter is told from one of their points of view, in first person. Sometimes, it was hard to remember who was speaking and this was very confusing. I did like the visual descriptions of the music, but the writing style did not seem quite as entertaining as in Peeps. I was disappointed in this as a sequel, but at least it did have a satisfactory ending."
2,Peeps is way better,"Without being mean.. i did not prefer this book. I loved Peeps and have loaned it out to friends and family. However this book was... strange.I was hoping for something more like the first book. This isn't. It starts out good. There is suspense and it's exciting.. but then you find out what the ""thing"" is and it's a disappointment. Peeps made sense, it was a virus that needed to be controlled. This is defiantly not like that.My advise is to pick it up at the library so you can see how it all ""ends""."
2,Just not interesting. . .,"I was SO disapointed in this sequel! I adored Peeps, and other works by Westerfield, so I kept hoping this book would improve until the very end. I think it was the characters. . .they didn't drive the book like Cal and Lace did. Plus since it skipped around in point of view a lot (which I ususally like), you never got a real sense of personality from anyone. The plot was pretty empty. . .not at ALL like Peeps. Still, Westerfield wrote it, and it had a few decent bits."
2,Decent,"I enjoyed the story behind this book. I did not, however, like the writing style. I kept needing to look back at the beginning of each chapter to determine who was the character speaking. They all had the same type of thoughts and therefore it sounded like one narrator when in fact is was supposed to be a different character each time. It had a pretty good story behind it though so overall I'd say that it was a decent book. The writing was a little bit too distracting for me with all the characters sounding the same, at some points it was difficult for me to pay attention to the reading because I was so bothered by the fact that there was no definition to the character's 'voices'. I can still say that I would recommend this book to another person, so long as they are aware that the writing style is dissapointing."
2,A big let down,"I loved Peeps, and Pretties, Uglies, and Specials, but Last Days was a big let down. Cal and Lace only make a cameo appearance, and I found it difficult to connect with or actually like the characters in Last Days."
1,worst book ever written,boring and i had to do it for a stupid english project too. sooo boring i hate it no one deserves to go throught the torture of reading this book
2,this book [stunk],this book [stunk] soo much i had to read it for an englihs project and i nearly feel asleep in it. this book has a stupid plot and shouldn't of even been published. i do not recommend you to read this.
2,"Neat, but not up to par for IVY","""Long Distance"" is maybe my FAVORITE album of all time by any artist... Ivy set their standard so high with the catchiness and ultra-mod production of ""Long Distance,"" that ""GUEST ROOM"" completely leaves me unsatisfied. Don't get me wrong, it is still a good album, and a must for Ivy fans, but I think it lacks the vibe and passion of other albums. Stylistically it is differnt too, with a much dryer, often generic sounding, electronic sound. Some great tracks, just not up to par in my opinion."
2,poor video quality,"After extensive comparison of digital camcorders, I bought this camera as a well-priced entry level alternative to higher-priced models that all have limitations.The video produced by this camera was simply unacceptable to me and I returned it. The images were grainy and highly pixelated. I thought this problem might be improved with use of an S-video hookup but it was the same (or worse). I also thought it might have been a ""low-light"" problem but the same thing was true (although less dramatic) shooting in well-lit rooms and even outside in the sunshine.The problem was probably exacerbated by the fact that I have a fairly large projection TV but when I hooked it up to a smaller tube set, the image was still very grainy.Too bad. I like the feel of the unit and the feature set was good. COuldn't keep it though because the picture would drive me crazy."
2,Doesn't really suck,Get a Sony or Panasonic if you can otherwise go for this. Inserting tape at the base of the camera is a pain. Menu is not intutive. The flip open OSD is difficult to get out and the hinge seems to be very frail. Installing the drivers was also not swift on Windows XP Pro. I had to really search throughly for where the driver was located in the CD provided. The start/off button is also hard to operate. If can't afford Sony or Panasonic than this might be an okay choice.
1,SAMSUNG SHOULD NOT MAKE CAMERAS,"I Had one of these, and after a year or so the LCD display when black, FOREVER. They want $180 to repair it when the FLEA MARKET sells better ones for half the price. Oh and the image quality was a couple of decades behind, PIXELLATION BELONGS IN THE 80's!!!!"
1,Don't buy this product it stopped working after the warranty.,I am extremely displeased with the life of this product. I shot about 20 hours of footage with it and it no longer works. Don't buy this camcorder.
2,Awful video quality,"The video quality is terrible~ in natural daylight indoors the images are grainy, dark, and the colors are inaccurate. I was filming my kids and my daughter's bright pink ball came out orange in the film. The images were not clear at all and everything appeared darker than to the eye. I have gotten MUCH better results from my old RCA vhs recorder than this digital one. In outdoors, at 1pm, I got similar disappointing results~ the colors of the trees were not captured and again, the images were darker than in real life. Very disappointing.I'm giving this camcorder 2 stars (rather than none) because it does have very good sound quality and it was easy to use. However, because I want decent recordings of my children, this is going back to the store today."
4,Pretty Good Camera.,"I bought this camera at sams club. I didnt know anything about camcorders and this was my first one. Now that Ive had it for awhile, I know more about the features that I want. The cool things about this camera are the numerous functions, like letterbox, color saturation, black & white, etc. The DIS is pretty decent at close range. The mic pickup is great. The noise of the tape recording has never been a problem. The couple of bad things are that the opening for the Firewire and attachments is kinda clumsy. The film quality is very very good.Id buy again."
1,I have had 5 of these cameras break in one year!!!!,"I purchased this camera a little over a year ago. A few days after the one month warranty it broke, it recorded and played everything with lines in it. We sent it to samsung to be repaired and they sent us a refurbished camera that had problems rewinding. Then they sent us a refurbished camera that wouldn't focus, then one that wouldn't record and now one that won't turn off.The camera's all arrived to my house broken!!!We have had the camera for a little over a year and it has been at Samsung's repair facility more than it has been in our home. I will never again buy a Samsung product!"
1,PROTECTION!!!,"Well, I'm glad I didn't pay for it. We won this camera Christmas 2004 as a door prize at a company holiday party. We probably got a total of 3 hours on the camera itself, and when we recently went to use it, flashing in the middle of the screen is the word PROTECTION!- baffled, we called Samsung customer service, and they explained that it is a common and known defect that can be fixed at a service center (at great cost) We explained that we had used the camera so incredibly little since we got it and asked if they could perhaps have it fixed for us. No dice- they wouldn't stand behind their product- and so I will continue on my policy of NEVER EVER buying Samsung products. Had they done right by me and my family, perhaps I would have changed my thinking toward them, but they've lost a customer for life. It's really a shame they don't think about things like that when they make those kinds of decisions. I suppose they really don't care though."
1,I have had two of these camcorders break!,"I liked the options, size and price. I thought Samsung was a good name for electronics, but I was wrong.I bought this as a gift for a friend.On the first week of use the battery clip broke and the battery would not lock on the camera. He was able to exchange the camera for a new one.And for this years holidays the new camera was used to record family and friends. During the recording it broke again and only showed and recorded a bunch of lines.And Samsung does not backup their products with a good warranty so now to repair the camera will cost around $60 US.I would not recommend Samsung camcorders. I have had a Sony for years and have not at any problems with it even after I dropped it a few times; the Sony also has a better picture. I also have an old GE 8mm Camcorder that also has a lot of recording time on it with out every having a problem.Please stay away from the Samsung camcorders."
1,Buy something else...,"My camera also quit working just outside of the warranty period. I am not able to play back ANYTHING other than a blue screen with the date via USB, component cables, nor the lcd screen.I use this thing a couple of times every few months, and then, only for a few minutes. I am disappointed. While the cost of these items have dropped over the years, it makes it cost prohibitive to repair. I would rather spend another $100 and get a new camcorder. It won't be a Samsung, I can tell you that."
2,Samsung will repair or replace this camera!,"If you have the problem of not being able to record other than audio, (bad CCD chip) Samsung will repair or replace this camera for free. Call Samsung with your serial number and they will e-mail you a UPS shipping label and RMA number for UPS. This is the result of a class action suite settlement. I hope this helps someone as it did I.Mark"
4,The best cost/benefit camcorder,"I had a very low budget and a newborn... (you do the math!)I did my research and finally, I got it.The features I love:- Can be used as webcam! I don't understand why they don't promote this feature. In fact, I went to Best Buy to see it and they had no idea about this capability.- Very light.- Resolution... it's ok. It's just for family memories... not to broadcast the SuperBowl in HD!!!- Built-in light.- Memory stick.- Night PIX- Good audio! Nice mic. Really.- A/V connectors in several flavors.Things I don't like too much but I can live with:- Very low resolution in snapshots.- Included battery lasts... nothing.- The cover of the A/V connectors is very weak. Any bad movement... and It's broken."
1,Nice video...but...substandard battery and broken after three uses.,"When this digital camcorder works, it records a nice picture and captures a lot of sound. It has, however, some major drawbacks.Our first main gripe is the substandard battery. We've charged it overnight and then would unplug thinking it was fully charged. After one week we'd grab the camcorder and head out the door to capture a magical moment...only to find the battery completely dead.After our third use, the camcorder now has some type of 'mechanical defect' as the manufacturer's manual calls it. The warranty is recently expired and so we're still debating whether to repair this item or just get another more reliable brand.If you decide purchase this camcorder, be sure to get extra batteries and always keep one on the charger. Hopefully you'll get more use out of yours than we did ours."
5,Taliesin-still alive & its future impact on architecture,"This video is a must for those who want to know the history of Taliesin, it's resident students (the fellowship), its owner Mr. & Mrs. Frank Lloyd Wright and what its history means and especially to the present and future of the architectural realms.I highly recommend owning it and even showing it to future clients of yours. It will enthuse them about the possibilities in our world and that ANYTHING is possible. My quote: ""think about design and he (Frank Lloyd Wright)will come"""
3,The Creepshow wants you to sell your soul,"Take a ride on The Creepshow express, cutting a path through ruffians, fast cars, and creatures of the night. ""Sell Your Soul"" captures the furious assault of their live show, rocking rhythms, explosive riffs, making for a swinging good time. Led by the vocals of Hellcat, a tough-as-nails femme-fetale, this four-piece aim to subvert minds with their brand of sleazy psychobilly (sometimes called horrorbilly) A chanting punk `n roll experience. But call it what you will, The Creepshow is pure rock and roll, blistering and balls-out. Despite the dark titles, their album is a collection of speaker-bursting gems, ""Creatures of the Night, Zombie Ball & Chain, Sell Your Soul, and Zombies Ate Her Brains."" Strap yourself in, let The Creepshow take you for a ride, The Underworld is waiting. But don't be scared, because you'll have a rollicking good time getting there."
3,Beware!,"This CD is great, love this band but beware, the DVD is PAL format, would not play on my DVD player."
3,Junior Wells Story,"If you're a Junior Wells fan, this comes recommended. The picture and sound quality is not great. Some of the jam performances featured on the DVD are also nothing to croon about. Nonetheless, the history of Junior Wells both as a bluesman and as a rags-to-riches story features very prominently. The story of how he supposedly stole a mouth harmonica and 'harped' his way out of the judge's courtroom, his brush-ins with Sonny Boy Williamson II, his value for diversity and love for others who were non-black, the origins of the song 'Messing with the Kid' and his own struggles to bring up his child, all feature is this dvd."
5,Excellent translation,"Although Seamus Heaney's translation is the one getting all the attention, and is very readable, this one is both readable and is a more word-for-word translation. The accompanying chapters on analysis of the poem are also fascinating."
4,Difficult Book But Worth It.,"This is another book that I bought for a college course, but I would have bought it anyway. It is not the easiest book to read and I suggest you take your time with it. But it is well worth the read. Great book."
3,This set is a great value.,"No problems or breaks yet after over a year. everything works as new. But, the helmet does come apart too easily, and the light plastic scratches easily."
5,6 year old son's favorite birthday gift,My son recieved this for his sixth birthday and it has been by far his favorite gift. The quality is top notch and he loves how it makes his voice scary and that it came with a light saber and a sword.
2,MAJOR dissapointment,when i bought this kit i thought it would be great but when i found out that it only had the helmet the cape and the sword i was dissapointed.I was expecting it all to be in it but no and now to be darth vader i had to pay ALOT of money just because this only was an acsessory kit.I say...............................DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,not worth it,i bought this product thinking that it was an excellent mp3/fm radio for the price. when i got it i tried it out and the music coming from the fm radio was so full of static that you could not hear anything the product on the whole looks like it might be worth $20.00 but not the price i paid for it
5,MORE FUN THAN A BAG OF SNAKES!,"Perhaps I'm in need of counselling.Perhaps I'm slightly touched in the noodle. True, it's no Lear, but DAMN, it's a fine piece of writing."
3,Incomplete but still interesting,"I read this a few years ago but I still think about Nijinsky and the causes of his mental breakdown. His wife Romola was always his protector and I had the feeling reading this that she was still protecting him by withholding information. I hope to find a more impartial and extensive biography of Nijinsky that will lead to a better understanding. Still, I was impressed by how Romola kept him alive through two World Wars and with little income, usually relying on the kindness and support of friends. It is sad that no visual footage of Nijinsky's dancing exists because he must have been amazing."
5,Had it before and gave it away. Realize it's benifits and bought it again.,"If you really want to learn Tai Chi, don't have a instructor and can learn on your own this is the book."
4,Worth the money,I was looking to improve my rock climbing abilities to prepare for the spring. This book is definiately informative with a clear and concise overview of what works and what is fad.
4,Nice,"I read this book, over and over. It has detailed exercise programs for all types of climbing, from sport to big mountain mountaineering. Easy to follow. I would recommend."
3,"Good Information, But Not Great","I initially purchased this book without hesitation upon recognizing Clyde Soles' name and recalling his excellent work as the gear editor for ""Rock and Ice."" And while he has done an excellent job of amassing a wide variety of information and adjusting it to a climbers needs, none of the material presented is really that original or profound. The bottom line of this books is eat healthy, train both aerobically and anaerobically, and supplement your climbing with strength training. I would reccommend this book for someone new to climbing and looking to set the foundation for good health and climbing. More experienced climbers looking for an additional edge or those with a solid understanding of the principles of health and fitness, however, should look elsewhere."
5,Even better than when I used it in 1967,At Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute it was an esteemed text. I still use it although the more recent editions embrace the changes in learning such as a CD with a computer graphing tool for better visualization.For brighter students this is the right text.
1,Dont be fooled.,"Those of you that believe those 5 star reviews are true, forget it. After passing a course of differential equations throughout a grueling semester I can certainly attest to the latter.This book has horrid if not completely non-existent examples and even the solutions manual is nearly worthless. If you've spent more than a semester without calculus you might as well forget trying to use this book in a formal course.Perhaps if you're a ""bright"" student you could make use of this book, though still it is absolutely no testament to professional teaching methodology. If you intend to learn the subject for any moderate application, look elsewhere. This book has no practical application examples worth any salt. This book is not for engineers; most certainly it's best application being for theoretical mathematicians.If your instructor requires this book, and you're an engineer, you'd better start hoping he's a darn good instructor."
2,Hard to follow,"Like previous users have mentioned, this book is very hard to follow. They skip many steps in their examples and I was always left thinking ""Where did that come from?"" It tends to be too formal and not explain enough."
5,The best,"I was long looking for a book on differential equations and I found this one to be the most easy to follow. There are lots of solved problems and interesting exercises. I recommend it to everyone who has had an introductory course in diff. equations, but who'd like to pursue a deeper treatment of the subject."
2,"Expresses simple concepts in a formal,complicated manner","This book, especially for the first 8 chapters, explains simple concepts in a difficult way. It is somewhat difficult to read, especially with all the formal notations, and often, it is impossible to tell what the author it trying to say. Some problems are ridiculously hard, requiring mathematical software in order to solve integrals. However, I found that the book does often review results, and this is useful. However, the examples are not the best, and are often too simple, and are missing most steps, which makes it almost impossible for a beginner student to understand."
3,It was hard to milk the PARTIAL D.E.s from this book.,"I felt that this book was generous regarding elementary differential equations, but the boundary value part was a disappointment. It made learning partial differential equations an ordeal. This book also lacks the convienient display of important formulae usually found on the inside covers of most college-level texts."
1,Did not come on time,"The product was ""shipped"" the next day; however I did not receive it until after the estimated 3 weeks. This is terrible. I was about to file a claim when it arrived. Unless you are buying your books a month in advance... do not buy it from this retailer."
5,The Bible on introductory differential equations,This book has just the right mix of real world applications and appropriate theoretical rigor. It is a good book not only for self study but also for a class. I've been following this book since version 3 and it keeps improving with each version.
1,This book sucked!,"If you're a math major, DON'T buy this book! Buy Ordinary Differential Equations by Morris Tenenbaum & Harry Pollard instead - an amazing book!"
2,Even answers too!,"This book was pretty much useless. Yeah, this book definitely sucks. Examples are sparse and not very helpful. The problems are also ridiculously tedious. Only reason I gave it a 2 was because it also had even answers in the back."
1,>>> Looking for another book on this subject... <<<,"This book is simply awful, one of the worst textbooks I've used for class purposes. Even though there seems to be plenty of examples, the books short fall is on explanations (i.e. how to get from one step to the next). This textbook also seems to make many assumptions about what the student may or may not know about prerequisite material. Definitions and General Formulas are not clearly boxed or highlighted, like you'd find in a James Stewart textbook. I'm currently looking for another Differential Equation textbook, in order to actually learn the material, and make it through my class this semester. I'm completely lost with this book. As a student (Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan) I've purchased many math textbooks over the years, and this one would probably rank as the worst- I would NOT recommend this book."
3,A great book for the motivated reader.,"Some of the reviews I've read about this book are rather negative. This is probably due to the fact that the book assumes a strong background in calculus (and some linear algebra), and the weaker student can easily become frustrated with the proofs and problems in this book. Not being too strong in calculus myself, there were times when I became annoyed at integrals which took sheets of paper to solve. However, this lack of ability on my part was easily solved by lectures, study groups, or software such as Mathematica, and I believe this can apply to anyone who isn't confident in their calculus background.The language in this book is rather formal, but this should not become a problem if the reader takes the time to read the book carefully.Overall, this is a great book for anyone who wants to learn diff eq's and is willing to put in the time and effort necessary."
4,Very educational and an Improvment over the 6th edition,"This book is a very good book to learn about differential equations, the most notable difference is that in the back of the book it has the answers to all the problems in each chapter. This is useful to make sure you are doing the problems right the first time. Some of the material is dry, and abstract but that is the norm for this subject matter. I would also recommend the student solutions manual for more worked out problems."
2,"Examples, Examlples, Examples","A great book if you want examples of practical applications of differential equations. All that is required of the reader is copying techniques and applying them to new problems. Nevermind that nothing is explained, just copy, copy, copy.Don't buy this book if you like to understand why and how something works, you won't get any explanations that are worth much in this book. Absolutely no theory behind the methods used is presented.All you get in this book is example after example, with very little worthwhile discussion."
4,Great Book!,"I personally liked this book. It's easy to read and study on your own without the aid of a teacher. Its weakness is perhaps the lack of demonstrations, but since I'm a physics major I wasn't extremely concerned with them."
5,Good Introductory Text,"I had taken this class as a Freshman at University of Texas Austin. It provides a very good introduction to the standard methods of solving diff (especially second degree)equations. Also, there is a very good collection of problems at the end of every chapter. Some of the problems are accompanied with hints which turns out to be quite helpful. The discussion on Sturm Loiville is also quite good. I will reccomend this book to anyone who wants to comprehend the standard techniques of solving diff eqns."
4,Useful for Learning Methods of Solution,"I recently took my college's ""introductory"" differential equations class. We did not use this book, but instead V.I. Ar'nold's, which isn't always quite appropriate for beginner's trying to understand how to solve a differential equation. So I turned to this one for reference. Overall, I found it to be of great help as a reference and guide to learning how to solve differential equations. It may well be QUITE dry, but I didn't really find that to be a hindrance. Overall, however, I would reccomend it more to the reader looking for a practical handbook for solving equations. If you're looking for the deep theory or beauty of the mathematics, you might want to look elsewhere."
3,Smells Great!,My daughters use this and the shampoo to match. They are 5 & 6 years old. They love the strawberry smell! I love that it softens/detangles their hair so that I can comb through it without too much fuss!! The bathroom always smells great when they are done too~like fresh mountain strawberries!This product is very inexpensive and works like a charm!
1,Barely works at all,"Purchased a collection of Garrity Flashlights and I would rate them at the bottom of the barrel of consumer items. Poor design, rarely work but mysteriously turn on in the drawer and runs batteries out. Stay away."
4,SENSATIONAL TALENT!,"I bought Michael Buble's debut album a year ago after seeing him perform on Larry King Live. I don't go a day it seems without listening to that album. I'm 21 years old and I think that he's far more talented than many of the singers out there today. I know most people my age don't listen to this music, but you can't deny talent, and that's what he has. Yes, the songs are not originals, but just the fact that someone as young as him in this day in age can actually pull off these songs and appreciate this music is so great. I would recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates music from the good old days! Very refreshing!"
5,WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO FLY WITH YOU!,"DOCUDRAMA STYLING IS DIFFERENT, BUT MR. BUBLE'S HONESTY SHINES THROUGH AND MOST AMAZINGLY HIS LIVE SHOWS REMOVE ANY DOUBT THAT HE IS TRULY A GREAT SINGER."
5,POWERFUL DVD POWERFUL CHARM,"Michael Buble has won me over with his charm. Charm. It's a word that resonates class and bearing. He's charming and on this dvd we're treated to his exquisite musical journey. From the opening moments you are treated to a private look at the man with the velvet voice. To audiences large and small, he sings with such passion and grace you feel his voice gracing your ears. His is the lovliest of sounds. When he invites the massive audience at one of his shows to sing the chorus of the classic Beegees song, How can you mend a broken heart, you can see the joy in his eyes knowing he is connecting with each and every one of them. And his connection to every audience is remarkable. There is love in the air and you feel it. That kind of magical energy that only the greatest entertainers possess is part of the Buble Gift.Charming...................."
3,Great Performance But Poor Audio & Video Quality,"I'm glad I watched the Michael Buble DVD. He's a very inspiring performer and it showed a little insight to his life. But, most of the Audio quality is crap. There's a lot of inconsistency of quality because the shots were taken with such diverse quality recording equipment, in many different locations. Some of it is bearable but a lot is bad enough to make you to want to turn the DVD off. The highlight of the DVD are three songs included in the bonus video content. These are three, very high quality recordings, that were shot in the studio. Don't miss these three jewels; they're the only reason to own the DVD."
4,Come Fly With Me,"This cd and dvd was recorded in 2004. Just about 2 years after Buble started making great music. He is still kind of raw in this dvd footage but you can tell, as in one of his songs, ""The Best is Yet to Come."" He isn't wearing Boss suits like he is now but he could then and now belt out a good rendition of ""Nice 'n Easy"", ""Fever"" and ""Kissing a Fool"" just to name a few. Great music produced by the ""Hit Man"" himself, David Foster. Great cd and dvd to listen to and watch if you want to see the early Buble."
5,Like Buttah,"One of my favorites. If this were a tape, it would be worn out by now. Excellent, smooth vocals. Michael does not disappoint."
5,"Velvet Voice, Charismatic Performer, Cool Guy","Seldom do I write an opinion, but felt it necessary to do so this time. Having been fortunate to see Mr. Bublé in concert I am left in awe of his talent. This dvd presents fairly a snapshot of what he's about in concert, but it couldn't ever capture the magic he makes when you're sitting there just mesmerized. He is THAT amazing.It seems he's always being compared to the late greats, which in itself is quite an endorsement of his gift. I suggest he will become the one that others are compared to. He's that good.....Yes, this is a good buy and an enjoyable substitute for Michael live!"
5,Great inside look at buble and his band.,"The arrangements are fantastic and the band flat out cooks! The songs are a bit of a memory lane journey (which is not a bad thing). These young guys know what the music is about, and play these great standards with fresh new vitality. Buble is obviously enjoying himself and this is quite clear in the DVD, which is the real treat in this package. There is a crafted balance of dialogue and documentary woven around the songs. On some tracks I wish they would just let the song continue without interuption, but understand the ""promo"" side of things. The bonus tracks from the AOL Sessions are very cool. The musicians again stand out as a group of amazing artists, all with really fine improvisational skills. The AOL Session truely displays a talented group of young jazz cats. This CD/DVD package is a well produced collection of classic standards. Buble is a fine singer, and a great entertainer!"
1,No Excuse For This,"This stuff is junk. The Sinatra and Bennett catalogs are still available for a reson. Please, youth of America - Listen to the originals!!"
1,Forget it. Another Sinatra wannabe,"This album is another attempt, by another guy (in this case a Canadian who has been 25 for like three years now according to his biography), that got under the wing of David Foster and that's about it. The songs are like impressions, and to be honest I like the likes of Brian Evans and Peter Cincotti MUCH better than this guy. The album sounds like karaoke tracks, and there is no feeling in the album the way Sinatra performed these songs. ""Fever"" sounds corny ""Feva!"" is what it should be called, and the way Buble sings it, even spelling it with four letters as I have is too long.I'm not into wannabe's, but there's one born every minute, but I suggest you buy ALL the albums of these guys, and then decide. This guy has nothing on either Evans or Cincotti, and time will tell."
1,Ugh!!!!,"Is this a joke? How in the world are we supposed to take this guy seriously? He has absolutely no talent and I find it hard to believe that anyone, outside his family and friends, finds this stuff enjoyable in any way, shape or form.This, along with his other albums, are virtually unlistenable. I am dead serious. He reminds me of a toned down Mark Harris (Mr. Matha Raye), and trust me folks...that ain't a good thing. Yikes!This CD is little more than coaster material at this point. Save your money!"
5,I LOVE MICHAEL BUBLE!,This CD and DVD are awesome...it's great to hear the live versions - brings you back to the concert...and the DVD shows you how he really is...which is still magnificent!
3,Good. Can be much better by cutting meaningless fillers.,"M. Buble is excellent in his singing! It looks like the producer had tried hard to promote the artist or to lengthen the recording time by adding many minutes of blah blah fillers in between songs which break the listensers' attention. The recording quality is a bit better than the sixties. At times, the brass sounds are not as clear and as sharp as the rest of the orchestra. As sound quality, it is around 3/5 as compared to Diana Krall's Live in Paris. Regrettable! I hate to press the fast forward button. In constrast, I have often used the repeat chapter button when listening to ""Live In Paris""!"
1,GREED,"A very poor recording. Loses a lot being recorded off the speakers in that venue. Could have been a great C.D. if it had not been recorded live. Michael has a fantastic talent, but it is wasted on this. I would send this back, if I could. Buy the""It's Time"" recording, if you wish to listen to real talent, andan outstanding musical background. I would not wish this one onmy worst enemy."
5,"if you love Bobby Darin, Sinatra, Nat Cole, this IS IT!","Good, better, BEST!cd is superb - DVD super superb!Bublé. WOW! One listen/look and like me, you'll be hooked."
5,exciting and wonderful,"My girlfriends and I just loved this new d.v.d. and c.d. of Michael's. What a wonderful treat and great way to spend an evening. We enjoyed with a glass of wine and pretended we were in every venue with this amazing man. He just keeps on getting better and better, if that is at all possible? For those who say he is not good on a previous review, you make it sound personal...is your other half maybe in love with this beautiful, talented hunk, you do sound very bitter!!! Just an observation, maybe you should have a glass of wine and chill, oh jealous one. For those who love to be lost in great music and the joking fun personality of a real down to earth star, I highly recommend this fantastic new d.v.d. from the ever fantastic Michael Buble."
1,He's not the new Sinatra.,"Ive only ever heared his songs on T.V ads, but he sounds like he has a snotty voice. He needs to go blow his nose."
5,Very informative,"I saw Michael during his concert in Tampa so watching him on the DVD was exciting. Enjoyed learning more about him as a person as well as a entertainer. He is awesome to watch. His band is outstanding. A CD and DVD, what a great package for the money. The CD is played at home and at work. Buble has it all; great voice, great music, it's a must have to enjoy again and again."
1,Flying too low,"The sound engineer for this cd should probably find a day job.Throughout several tracks, I could hardly hear Buble, while the band blasted. It seemed like he moved from one side of the stage to the other, but the volume was not increased so that he could be heard. Faded in and out. Somewhat disappointing."
3,"Bad Mix, but Good Combination","Great idea but poor execution of concert album. Buble's voice is awesome, but can be heard only poorly on this poorly mixed album. DVD is great! All-in-all, nice for a fan to own, however CD doesn't get much play in the car due to bad volume mix."
3,"2 1/2 stars for the dvd,3 1/2 stars for cd","I bought this album about 3 weeks ago,the first time i heard his ""MICHAEL BUBLE""album,it was 1 year ago at hmv's store in singapore.....,and it was a terrific album. since then i was so anxious to watch his live in concert dvd and Finally, i found this cd dvd album.unfortunetly, the live concert on this dvd didn't really meet my expectation of what his concert supposed to be.too many interviews and it was like watching a video clip rather than a live concert but anyways u have to watch it for yourself, and u decide !! so 2 1/2 stars for the dvd and 3 1/2 stars for the cd"
2,Pick something else,"I got this album after hearing him sing Sway. Was quite disappointed for two main reasons:1) CD doesn't have many tracks, and I don't think the singing here was that fantastic2) DVD is very distracting because of the constant change of view. After a while it got to the extent of being nauseating for myself, and the overall content isn't be any means spectacular, visually and aurally.I don't have this album any more, but I think the other Michael Buble - Michael Buble album is a better buy, with more tracks and lower price. The DVD in this album isn't worth watching."
5,Best Money I Ever Spent,"Buying this DVD was the best entertainment money I've ever spent --- it's that good.This DVD takes YOU there! Every song, every gesture, every audience interaction -- it's a fascinating look at our generations Sinatra upclose and personal.He captivated every audience and you'll sure see why."
1,This CD is not very good.,"I thought Bean: The Album was a disappointment. After watching the Bean movie, this CD was not nearly as funny and didn't give you the same mood as watching the movie."
2,Could not hold my interest,I was very interested in the interpretation of Baba Yaga but it was a very slow start. This is book is not for a reluctant reader. Gregory Maguire writes very well but Lost and Dream Stealer are not his best.
5,foxes,this was a great early 80s movies about teens partying and durgs and what happens in the end is sad
4,A fan,"I love Jodi and I am a Runaways fan, Ms. Curry should have done more movies, not a bad job for her first one."
3,Sad Ending,"The movie is alright. But the scene right before the end is powerful and intense!! The last scene is all the more powerful with the addition of a melodic piano verson of Donna Summer's ""On the Radio"" playing. These two scenes alone make the movie worth watching - especially with your kids if you have them, and make you want to hug them and tell them you'll be there for them no matter what!"
2,"Not bad to sit through, but don't look forward to it.","The best thing about this movie is seeing Jodie Foster and Scott Baio so young! It is obvious of Jodie's talent even in a movie like this. You wonder where the plot is going, and what is the point of the movie. Also, if you can stop laughing at the clothes, you might enjoy parts of this movie. Not bad all in all, but not one of the greatest. What was up with the skate board craze back then?"
2,HORMONES A GO-GO,"Something like a slut-fest as girls from one summer camp, and boys from the competing summer camp... Your search for sensitivley portayed adolescent issues shall be long, arduous, and wasted. A ""campy"" sequel to the pedophillic ""Pretty Baby""? Sorry. I couldn't help it."
2,"a 'difficult' movie; unfortunately, it ain't very good either","It's always a shame to see a really talented actor/ actress star in a dud of a movie, but that's exactly what happened to Jodie Foster with 1979's ""Foxes"". Directed by Adrian Lyne, who would later go on to direct the notorious ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Foxes"" is a cheap, lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life. The movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another, making it hard to stay focused. The movie isn't a TOTAL waste--a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention; and Jodie Foster, still under 18 when this was filmed, has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she isn't given much to work with. Plus, that piano melody of Donna Summer's ""On The Radio"" which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel. Overall though, ""Foxes"" really is pretty lousy and can't be given much of a recommendation."
1,Was it ever good? I think not.,"Trials and tribulations of Jodie Foster and her 3 twenty-something year old high school friends...Jodie gives a fair performance, but the others were substantially less than average. Sally Kellerman as Jodie's mom was pretty good. Laura Dern (""Jurassic Park"") was interesting in her small scenes. Randy Quaid as one girl's boyfriend was mediocre (see ""The Last Detail"" for his excellent role in a good movie.)Due to music and cultural references, plus the clothes and hair styles, the movie is pretty dated, but that is not a contributing factor to its badness. False dialogue and some typical cliches are factors, however. The partying scenes are also unconvincing, as everyone smokes joints like cigarettes, drinks a lot, and never appears intoxicated.Director Adrian Lyne has made some good movies (""Jacob's Ladder"", ""Lolita""). Unfortunately, this is not one of them.Scott Baio escapes bullies on his skateboard. Need I say more?"
5,Foxes With Jodie foster,"I have been looking on and off for this movie for years. I gave up for almost a decade then found it here on Amazon. I recall it as being one of the first 'grown up' type movies for me, in my teens, in the 1980's that I saw, and loved! It also introduced me to Donna Summer and her new album at the time, 'On The Radio'. It brought back a lot of feelings from that time, of growing up, the difficulties, the hardships, and the fun! It is a movie I have already watched 4 times in a month. It has its depressing moments, but it has its 'teenage' moments that I could relate to at the time, and it brought back those memories. A great movie overall, and to this day, well Dona summers 'On The Radio' still brings back he feelings of the 80's and being a teenager.It is to bad there is not a lot of interviews, or extras on the DVD. It would have been great to hear from the actress' especially Jodie Foster, and compare her to today. A great movie!!"
5,"Simple, but fun!","This is a great, simple, beginner educational toy! I love that you can see through the pieces, and some of the pictures move around. My daughter has played with this toy almost daily for the past year. It seems so simple, but this toy has provided hours of entertainment for our little one! I'm confident it will do the same for your child!"
3,nesting blocks,"i think nesting/stacking blocks are a fabulous toy, but my kids wanted nothing to do with these. they rather play with wooden blocks or plastic colored cups that nest from the dollar store. i ended up giving these away within the first year."
4,Not up to snuff,"My family adore peek a blocks. The nesting blocks are the latest in a long line of incredible toys, so our expectations were quite high. While these toys are constructed well, they are not, in my opinion, peek a blocks because they are not closed blocks. The charm of the peek blocks is that you get to peek inside sealed blocks. These are not sealed blocks. Good, but not on par with other peek block sets"
3,"Made by AvonHome, a division of Croscill","I jumped at the price of this set and the name Croscill, but, as it turns out, it was really made by AvonHome, apparently a division of Croscill. It lacks the quality of Croscill products, but is serviceable and a pretty decent buy."
5,GREAT Stocking stuffer!,"Looking for a gift for someone who has everything? Well this is the one. Fun little cartoons which sometimes are even like a riddle for you to figure out but once you do you'll be laughing eggnog out your nose. B.O. Frosty, Frosty gets the Mumps and Larry Curly And Moeman (snowman with 3 stooges faces on each snowball) are some of my favorite but you have to see them to get the jokes. Also look for others in the series Like ""Ginger Snaps""- Happy Hollidoodles"
1,Not as good as promised,"I have used this on six of DVD's that were skipping. and out of six only one stopped. I have also noted that it gets a little hard to wipe off when it dries the 15 minutes it suggests, and I have concerns of rubbing to hard and breaking the dvd."
4,HARD BOOK TO STOP READING,once you start reading this book it is hard to put down.the stories are hard to believe.I wish that it went into more detailed information.
4,Fun and Informative,"This book is a fun and quick read. Very informative regarding the myths and truths of the Ouija Board. Also gives a birds eye view of the psychology behind this most interesting device. Would recommend for a fun read or for anyone curious about the Ouija board, it's history, and how it works."
5,Various Views of the Ouija Board,I find this book fascinating. Truly anyone curious about the Ouija board will like this book.I am going to read this book from beginning to end again.
1,OUIJA The Most Dangerous Game,The details I needed were pretty much absent from this book.... I also don't like the title. To me the OUIJA is a friendly conduit to the spirit world. It holds the potential to bring comfort and reassurance from those who have passed on to another dimension to those incarnated on earth here and now.
3,White Admiral,"As a film with little budget and an ensemble cast, I enjoyed White Admiral. It's about a woman who has lost her memory and a private detective called in by a blind woman, who maybe has her own motives for keeping close to the memory loss woman. The style is quite attractive and it's well filmed."

1,Next to worthless,"This book was almost a total waste of time and money. First, it only covers configuring Samba using SWAT which makes it worthless if you are running a secure server. In addition to this, the index does not include any of the configuration directives so if you do have some idea what you are looking for you can't find it without thumbing through the entire book."
2,Not Very Good...,"I really wanted to like this album. I really did, I'd heard about how great this album was supposed to be, I had bought Rid of Me and Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea and they're brilliant. Absloutely brilliant. But I bought this one (which was quite a bit more than either of those). I was shocked. Complete and utterly shocked this was a PJ Harvey CD! The lyrics were fine, but the music was TERRIBLE. There were no hooks, it was just kind of there. I didn't like this CD at all, and would prefer if it didn't exist, but to my sadness it does. One star because its PJ Harvey, the other because the lyrics are good."
4,You leave me dry.....,"PJ's early albums. Classic. She's brutal with her lyrics and raw energy. Must have if you're a PJ fan. It's a little more light than her Rid of Me album, but brilliant just the same."
5,More Than A Masterpiece. Huge.,"DRY transcends all genres. It is the perfect marriage of wit and raw passion. It's poly-rhythmic, brutal, literate, raw, brilliant, honest, artful, mythic, original, relentless, courageous, and all the other words I can't think of. It's more than what I'm saying right now, and more than I could ever say. Play it loud to feel its power. (But if you're driving, please be careful and watch the road.)"
4,PJ Harvey - Dry,"Overall, this is my favorite PJ Harvey album. It's not her best (that would be either the rather dark ""To Bring You My Love"" or the generally innocuous ""Stories From The City/Stories From The Sea""), but I keep listening to it again and again. The songs are in a variety of musical styles, ranging from folk/blues rock to 1992-era hardcore rock. So there's a lot of variety. If you don't like one song, wait for the next. Most of the songs are good -- only a couple leave me flat (""Joe"" and ""Plants And Rags""). I cannot say that one song is the best of the bunch, but ""Sheila Na Gig"" represents this period of PJ Harvey's career the best for me. And it rocks!If you have never heard PJ Harvey, ""Stories..."" would be a better choice. She will not appeal to everyone."
4,A very good album,"Hey, to the shmuck who said ""this is what happens when your sister listens to too much Nirvana"" -- check the date, man. This album was contemporanious with Nirvana, and indeed shares a link to that band in producer Steve Albini. PJ is her own artist, posessive of a strength of self not seen since Billie Holiday and this record captures that in a very visceral way.That said, it's not as good as Rid of Me, but it's a very good album. If you can find a bootleg of the demos that led to this album (called ""Jungle Queen""), the non-electric sessions of these same songs are much more captivating...I'd have to say Albini's influence spoiled things a little bit."
4,Excellent book,"This book is very good. As a student in mechanical engineering, I learned a lot about CFD and fluid mechanics. The price is little high but I using a coupon from couponsky.com and save a lot. It is worthy to buy if you are interested in CFD area. I recommend this book to students as me."
3,Archon: Can be fun,"I recently purchased Archon for the NES. This is a truly unique game, in which you play on a puzzle-like chess board. Move pieces around and the team to capture all pieces of opposite color wins. However, when a piece lands on another piece of opposite color, it immediately switches to a new PvP battle-style screen. It's hard to explain, but truely unique and definetally worth a try for any NES collector."
4,Pretty good Flick,Watched several times and still not bored w/it...good clean funny movie where relationships/friendships are tested throughout the movie. Descent performances by R. Downey Jr. and A. M. Hall. Uma Thurman is ridiculously beautiful in this one!
3,Anthony Hall is hot!!,"In ""Pretty in Pink"" he was a nerd....but boy did he grow up to be a hottie in this movie....where is he now???"
1,Worst ever!,"I'm a BIG Robert Downey Jr fan, but this has GOT to be one of the WORST movies I have ever seen... and poor Uma - 'Introducing Uma Therman...' How horrible for this to be your film debut. But, then again, I guess that gives her an excues. MAYBE, if I'd seen it back in the day... but even then, I doubt it. It just doesn't stand up against the Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, etc.Good thing I got it Cheap!"
3,warning the DVD movie is censored,"I've been a big fan of this movie since it first came out, with that said I give the movie alone a 5 star rating. However, the MGM DVD release is edited, which brings the score way down. There's a scene in the movie where Johnny is playing football to win back his girlfriend from her father, during the game 3 cheerleaders flash the cops to distract them. This has been edited and all that is shown is them starting to lift their shirts then it cuts quickly to the next scene. Now I didn't buy this movie for the nudity but censorship in any form is just unforgivable especially when it's unnecessary because all the other scenes containing nudity (that I can remember) are intact. Though more scenes could have been edited I'm not sure. The DVD extras include only one trailer for the movie, so it's basically barebone which I expected it to be. I still suggest you buy this DVD the quality is excellent just a little warning it's not the original."
4,Johnny be good,"Johnny Be Good was a good movie, funny, reminds of the fun that I had in high school. The only difference was that I didn't have the choice of what college to attend. The only thing that I have against the movie is edited. I use to own an unedited copy but I got rid of it."
2,Hollywood spin to the mess that is American high school sports,"This movie was about American high school football at its height of 80s corruption and destructiveness. Of course we see that today (look at the Sandusky scandal) but it was the 80s when this stuff really took off--throwing money at kids who couldn't or refused to apply themselves in something other than playing, sex, and money. Anyway supposedly Johnny was not one to fall for this (which is a farce) as he was ""true"" to his girlfriend (a young Uma Thurman . . . who is not a very attractive young girl by the way). . . . Anyway he is wined and dined and in the end ""does the right thing"" (which again is very very unrealistic for the subject matter). The story is a stereotype at this point . . . the poor football player needing the big college ""ride"" to support his family etc. Anyway the only good thing about this is to see a young chubby Robert Downey Jr. And to see as always a good looking Anthony Michael Hall."
2,Typical 1980's teen comedy movie,"2 of 5 stars to the 1980's typical teen comedy movie Johnny Be Good. To the movies credit, it has several young actors who turn out to be name-brand people. How about Uma Thurman? Robert Downey Jr? Anthony Michael Hall? So that was good.The plot is about a high school football star who is trying to decide which college to attend. So, we follow AM Hall as his character visits several colleges who each roll-out the red carpet with VIP perks to get him to decide in their favor. The whole thing would be OK if you can possible believe that Hall COULD be a football star. My thinking is that on his first tackle, he'd be broken-up into little parts. He simply was not believeable as a star player.So, the movie was mildly funny with the usual plot twists and gags. Nothing special to recommend this movie. As I said at the start, a typical 1980's style comedy. Oh, it had too much 1980's synthesized music--my head hurts.You can skip this one."
2,Uma Thurman in Teen Movie Hell,"Even at the tender age of sixteen, Uma Thurman has the good sense not to appear very much in this death-rattle of a teen flick. Anthony Michael Hall, impressive as a nerd in The Breakfast Club appears to have been living on cow pie ever since, and has filled out to become a most ungainly quarterback. Some colleges try to recruit him. He eventually realise this is a bad thing, and money isn't everything. Ho hum. Funniest bit was realising that people ... now think that the geek is attractive."
1,ripoff,"This would only appeal to you if you did not have access to the internet. This CD simply packages public domain US Geological Survey websites onto a CD. While the websites are updated often, some daily, the CD is essentially a webdump of those sites as of a certain day several years ago. The websites are excellent, this product is simply web mining of public domain stuff, repackaged and resold to consumers. Use this money to get internet access and check out these updated sites."
4,Very fine pianist of little renown,"Sensitive, nuanced playing of the highest order by Mme. Thyssens-Valentin. Especially fine are the adagio of the Mozart concerto and the 1st & 3rd ""Romances sans Paroles"" by Fauré. A scrappy orchestra in the Mozart, and poor Ducretet-Thomson sound throughout are serious drawbacks.I have not heard her all Fauré discs, but they have received very enthusiastic reviews from other Amazon reviewers."
4,Too bad Dan Rather did'nt see this film..,"I am glad to see a documentary about the real power behind the Bush cabal: the manipulation of reality by Rove and his ""Big Lie"" team.This documentary lays down the outline of how, through careful media manipulation; Rove turned a Skull + Bonesing, Bohemian Grove Moloch worshipping, draft dodging substance abuser into the darling of the Republican party. Hopefully this film will aid in the deprogramming of the American people.People need to watch this documentary and others like Bush's Brain, which are replacing ""mainstream"" news as a source for REAL information. That is why you will keep seeing reviews by Neocon minions spouting nonsense like ""The producers hate America"", ""Bush is god!"", ""Dissent is treason, send them to a camp!"". Face reality, watch this film and then do the research yourself.Remember, being a scared, ignorant Neocon lackey won't save you, knowledge will keep you free."
4,well done,"This documentary shows the facts underlying what we already knew about Rove. Well done, but not as great as Michael Moore."
1,"Movie Review, not political soap box","OK, all of the reviewers have stated their political opinions and most have called Bush ""stupid"". What does this have to do with a movie review? Bush has a Harvard degree remember? Back to the film. Very shallow and without enough content to be even mildly entertaining. No matter how much I may disagree with Bush I just can't possibly like this film. 99% of the PBS documentaries I see for free are better than this. Throw whatever dirt you want but at least try to make a descent film; or go back to the PF Chang's where you were waiting tables. Disgraceful attempt at riding on the coat-tail of other political documentaries. I wouldn't even waste space on my TIVO for this."
1,Pure Baloney,"This movie is not only a total distortion of facts, it is also quite boring. What a waste of time and money. Another attempt by the ""enlightened"" Hollywood Media who know so much more than we poor ignorant peons about Bush. At least the BS put out by Moore was somewhat entertaining in its revison on History. This one is total Dullsville."
1,"Oh, please!",Straight-up hack job from some Michael Moore wannabes. Conspiracy theories abound! I invite anyone who watches this film or reads the book to spend a little time investigating the facts... An objective individual will find there's a great deal more fiction and fantasy than accurate reporting in this work.
1,Bush's Brain,"This film stinks because it is a lie. It cuts down the president in time for the election. It is slanted and untruthful. It portrays our intelligent, strong, and integrity filled presidentas a puppet."
4,"Lots of smoke, but no smoking gun","This is an fascinating look at a major player. While it implies a lot without making actual accusations - much like the reputed m.o. of the film's subject - it's an interesting character study. It may not be fair or balanced, but that's not it's point. As an inside glimpse at the bloodsport of party politics, it's an intriguing whodunnit. Perhaps it's best attribute is that it arouses people's curiosity. Rove certainly isn't the only one to play this game, but he may be the reigning master. People may not learn anything watching this film, except how hungry they are to find out more. If it gets folks fired up to dig deeper & learn more, it seems to me that it's accomplished what it set out to do."
5,What a fun set!,"What a fun building set!with versitile mmix and match pieces kids can make many differnt fun birds. Or they can read the incuded book and make the birds in there!The special surprise was on of the bird heads is actually a whistle, a big hit with my daughter!I hope to get more of these sets!"
5,Jack Tales,"This book is very dear to my heart. The stories told in this book came from my family, R.M. Ward. I grew up hearing my grand parents, father & Richard Chase tell these tall tells. I read them to my kids now and I hear my relatives in my head so I begain tellin-um like they told me.My hope is that these stories live on through the generations of my family as well as other families.I love hearing my daughter ask for just one more just like I did."
5,A moving experience,"First of all, it's almost below the dignity of this film to compare it to the recent hollywood George Clooney remake. The remake was awful, in my opinion.On the other hand, I give this (1972 Russian version) 5 stars because it was one of those movies that ... effects you, after watching it, the ideas sink in, and it's something you won't forget.Even if you have already seen the remake, the old one is worth watching, it should feel like a totally different, yet in contrast good, movie."
5,A Rare Blend of Fine Art & Science Fiction,"For those who miss genuine science fiction and also for the ones who have always wondered what science fiction is, Solaris might be a wonderful treat.Science fiction is not just about future technologies. In my view, s.f. explores (human) intelligence and how it enables us to observe and communicate with the universe around us. In this sense, s.f. celebrates being (intellectually) alive.Solaris is a tremendous achievement, a poetic and romantical masterpiece where love is portrayed as the only activity which will enable humankind to break free from the world of symbols and ""see things as they are."""
3,"perplexed, bothered & bewildered","My brain is just not geared to this far-out movie. It took a while to understand the overall concept. I put myself into the characters. Living in a space ship captured into locked- in strange world. Actually, I would behave like the characters presented. The film does make one think & think......."
1,Disappointing 2001 wannabe,"Solaris takes the cake when it comes to throwing in every sort of 2001 effect and no coherent plot line. Racked with tediously long pauses devoid of meaning, Solaris would put anyone not abusing narcotics to sleep or drive them to the stop button on the remote. This movie isn't even worth rewinding!"
2,Sllloooooowwwwwww... ... ...,"interesting to say the least, but no, it's not good, it's boring. is it an intelligant film? yes, but that doesn't mean it's entertaining. watch a stephan hawkins tape instead, at least you'll learn something instead of trying to be some kind of art hippy loser."
1,A great movie for the brain dead,"It you include yourself among the countless people who confuse artistic with long winded and boring, this film is for you. If not, perhaps you'd better spend your time reading real science fiction."
5,"Solaris, given the Criterion treatment","If you are considering buying ""Solaris,"" then you are already a sophisticated buyer, and so you probably want the cleanest transfer, most complete print, and the least clutter. Criterion is superb at that. While the Blu-Ray format's doo-dads are wasted with ""Solaris,"" it would be against Tarkovsky's vision as well as the film itself to allow the machine to dazzle. Just as the movie is about the mystery rather than the process of exploration, so the Blu-Ray DVD relies on an alternate audio alone to provide an ""extra."" This extra track alternates between two film scholars who offer notes on the individual scenes, the film maker, and the background of the movie. Their comments are as often dry as interesting, so they never threaten to step in front of the film itself, but they are a nice auxiliary to the film."
2,only movie worse than Tarkovsky's Solaris is Soderbergh's S.,"There is only one Solaris. It is a great, timeless book written by S. Lem. The two movie adaptations to date are quite bad. Tarkovsky's Solaris is so far removed from the book that it should say that is it loosely based on it, instead of being claimed as an adaptation.It is a russian answer to Kubrick's '2001' as much as the terrible Tupolev-144 was a russian answer to the Concorde. Most educated people have heard of '2001' (heard, not necessary liked it), while Tarkovsky's 'Solaris' enjoys well deserved obscurity, not only in the west, but also in Russia, and in Poland (S. Lem's home country).People who like Tarkovsky's 'Solaris' will continue to like it, I can only hope that people who don't like it won't think that S. Lem's book is as bad as the movie. Because it is so much better."
1,NOT FOR AMERICAN REGION,DO NOT BUY THIS!!The information about this DVD is a LIE! It is NOT for U.S. Region.My DVD rejected it as unplayable because it is restricted to Region 3--NON U.S.!!!What a serious WASTE of money!
3,This one is a selective viewing,"I originally saw this movie when it was on cable a year ago. When I saw it I was in an inebriated state. It is a long and drawn out movie with DEEP metaphysical meanings and short on actual entertainment. I ordered it because I created a weekend activity called ""Bender Weekend"" the point of which is to play drinking games to Sci Fi movies, and as the weekend progresses the movies are more and more metaphysical in nature. The end of bender weekend caps out with ""Altered States"", ""2001"", and this one.If you want entertainment, stay away from this movie. If you like metaphysical tones and are willing to see past the low budget, long drawn out scenes, there is value in this movie. So you will either love, or completely despise this movie."
5,Tarkovsky's Masterpiece,"Tarkovsky's reinvention of the science fiction genre remains his masterpiece. Psychologist Kris Kelvin, leaving behind nature and his family home and burning his guilt in a bonfire, encounters his dead wife in a space station orbiting the ocean of materialized memories and consciousness which is Solaris. This is a film about lost love, remembrance of things past, and the meaning of life which will haunt you in the deepest philosophical and emotional sense."
4,Sci Fi Art Film,"This film would probably be out of print if it was not selected for the Criterion Edition treatment. They cleaned up the old print as usual and added a whole 'nother disk of extras. You need the commentary to try and understand what is happening in this slow moving and deep analysis of humanity, aliens, the future, bureaucracy and more!Don't look for special effects in this Russian language film constrained by money and the communist agenda. Look for great camera work and tough acting where emotions flow freely but are controlled and constrained.This movie will keep you talking for days. Billed as the Russian 2001 at the time, as the commentaries point out, they were trying to make the exact opposite actually."
3,Slow moving cerebral sci-fi,"Russia's answer to 2001 is much slower and murkier than the Kubrick film.The special effects are pretty laughable and there is little in the way of action. It is a real ordeal to watch with seemingly endless dialogue.On the plus side some of the production design is quite good, and the climax is genuinely haunting.Soderberg's tighter update is superior - and is an hour shorter."
2,"Ponderous, dull, pretentious","Dull, ponderous, pretentious, and visually unappealing to boot. As a long-time sci-fi fan, and fan of Soviet cinema, I just do not get the fascination with this movie. It's like watching people standing around talking about paint drying. But hey, some people like to watch paint dry apparently.Read the book. It's shorter (and more lucid) than many of the five-star reviews here.Effusive praise can't conceal the fact that Lem was a far better writer than Tarkovsky was a director. Great novel but dreadful adaptation."
3,Bored out of my mind,"Hi--Wonderful cinematography. But just about every scene was too long, as were many shots. You just felt like shouting 'cut'!Interesting ideas in places. But too much dialogue, too many aphorisms / philosophising; eg 'Man(kind) is...'Detached: didn't feel anything for the main character.Pretentious in feel.Where was the score? Sound?Slow moving, unengaging plot.Overall: cold, stagnant and boring. There were just too many unnecessary pointless moments._S"
3,"very slow, very long and not worth 36 bucks","in the late 1960's head trips were in and this movie is a head trip. maybe that explains its great reputation. it can't be the movie itself which is incredibly slow, highly overrated and not all that much better than the mediocre steven soderbergh remake (though it's certainly much longer and more confusing). it's not entirely the lem novel either. it's a combination of the novel and the director's vision of making peace with your past (or something of the sort). anyway, the movie's not worth 36 dollars. i can't imagine watching it again anytime soon. if you're interested in solaris, do yourself a favor and buy the lem novel instead. it's a little dry but it's better and cheaper than this."
1,A useless adaptation,"I came to Tarkovski's Solaris in a strange way. As a SF adept, I first happened to watch the Clooney's version and I liked it very much. Unlike many, I was really fascinated by both pictures, enigmatic storyline and mesmerizing music.So I decided to read the book ! Stanislas Lem's novel was quite different from Sotherberg's movie, but I found it rather pleasant on the whole, despite clear weaknesses and sometimes clumsy writing (especially character handling and dialogues). Then I had to watch Tarkovski's movies... Alas ! Apart from the end, a few chronological changes, and some details, it is a boring, lenghty, rather mediocre, and useless adaptation of the book."
2,Fooled by the Hype,"The excitement of possibly discovering an unknown gem was real,and the film's beginning meditations on water,earth and sky seemed promising.However the remainder of this movie must have written by a teenager impressed with his own wisdom.LONG and TEDIOUS are the obvious adjectives.It is unbelievable this small film is even compared to the majestic 2001.The scene where Chris places Hari in the rocket and blasts her from the space station is unintentionally funny;he would have been burned to a crisp.I guess at the time we wanted to heap praise and encouragement on the oppressed Russian film industry."
2,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"To those who believe this movie is great: It is NOT.To those who think this movie is too long: It is not; it only seems like it.I fell asleep four times while trying to watch it (while reading subtitles). I would wakeup, rewind to the point where I fell asleep and continue trying to watch it, and try to stay awake.I was expecting a long movie; but, I version I watched was only 2 1/2 hours long. So, I thought may I got an edited version that had critical scenes cut out. But, I now understand that I got the complete movie. Maybe, I just got a bad translation?"
3,Not much spice,"The 180 salsa recipes in this book could be reduced to 12 or so good ones. Many are simply repeats of others in the book with only very slight variations and a different name. I'm glad I got the book, because I will use the 12 good recipes, but don't buy it for 180. You'll be disappointed if you do."
1,Salsa Lovers Cook Book,"I couldn't have been more disappointed- this is a cook book for beginning cooks: like the old Betty Crocker cook books from the 50s. Many of the ingredients come out of cans and the range of chilis used, well let's just say it includs jalapenos, ""green chilis"" (Anaheims, I believe), one recipe with dried anchos, and,I believe, that's it!There are other recipes using ""salsa"" in the broadest term to include sweet dessert sauces, salad dressings and other things that are NOT Mexican in the slighest. There are no roasted tomato salsas, no mention of all the wonderful fresh and dried chilis available out there.I am really glad that I didn't pay full price for this; I'll probably send it to a friend back East who has never eaten real Mexican food."
2,Not the best,There is not really many recipes for a true salsa lover! I got this as a gift for someone who loves salsa and he had troubling finding ones that were hot enough for his taste.
5,Book of Oscar Wilde's Short Stories,I was familiar with these stories but I always enjoy reading them again. Nobody writes with such humor and style like Oscar Wilde.
2,Not his best work,"i usually find Oscar Wilde's stuff to be delightfully witty and wise. Parts of this were excellent, very much up to his usual standard, but most of this book was pretty forgettable."
5,excellent interpretation of Wilder's short story,"This is a CBC dramatized interpretation of Wilde's short story. Taped in front of live audience, this is by far the best story- telling that has ever done to Wilde's work. Both music and sound effect are superb, and best of all, the narration and dialogues closely follow the original story. In this respect, CBC has outperformed BBC by a large degree."
3,Not bad,"A very interesting read.Personally I should have gone one of the cheaper versions of this book - it is a very basic scan and print job and is missing a few minute sections (a word here or there, somehow?)Recommended reading but get one of the cheaper copies."
3,Reminicent of Grand Theft Auto!,"The storyline is excellent but they should've left Liberty City as Brocklyn, Kings, Brix, and Manchester surrounded by New Guernsey instead of changing it to Portland Island and Staunton Island next to Shoreside Vales!"
3,"solid, but I've played better gba games","This was quite fun, however the technology and gameplay were inferior to the independent product by the name of Karnaaj. Plus at $8.99 you can't beat that price. For anyone that is a fan of this title and racing in general I would recommend this as well."
2,Not worth it,"I rather recomend to expend a couple more dollars to get a better bike, i just got it and i already have to put work into it, the breaks sucks, pieces were missing, anyway, that is what you can get for a GMC i guess."
1,Piece of s**t,"I bought a gold one and I found out that my front wheel had some problems, my kickstand broke down, my rear brake was stuck to the wheel. I don't know what other colors will be just DON""T BUY THE GOLD ONE"
2,Low Quality,Assembly wasn't too bad. Once I was able to get it on the road the back tire went flat in under one mile - I'm very disappointed.
5,awesome road bike,"Looked and looked for an inexpensive road bike and finally found this one. Was a little worried it would be junky but it turned out to be great! Fast, light, looks cool too..."
2,Uncomfortable for me - too low handlebar,"It's a good quality for the money you pay.Assembly is simple, but when I tried to ride it , I found that it's not for me.To be able to reach breaks, you need to fold down.If you driving and need to break, it will take you a couple of seconds to change your hands position. It feels unsafe.I tried to turn handlebar into up position, but there you can not use breaks at all.Breaks themselves are too weak - be aware.Overall - OK bike for the racing, not for cruising.Still unused and I am looking to sell it.Somebody interested? I am in CT. 203*809*1462"
2,"GMC Denali 25"" road bike vs Schwinn, big loser.","It is what you paid for, a light frame with heavy forks and rims. The brakes, levers and derailleur's are garbage. Same thing's on my 7 year olds bike.I knew upgrade items would be needed, but also the shifter's? These are not Revos. Bottom drawer crap the Chinese replaced them with. Along with the saddle, rear derailleur and tires. These have 700 x 32c tires on it. Shall I go off roading now? On a road bike?The rear tire has a 5 mm difference between left and right frame seating.Who ever is managing this manufacturing sight for Kent abroad is doing a piss poor job. I will probably send this back due to the poor quality issues.Schwinn is made in China, and they do it right?Guess I have to go back to to Schwinn if I want what I expect. Quality, no questions asked."
2,"Useless Directions, but Easy to Assemble (2 Allen + 1 Adjustable Wrench Required) - Shifting Shoddy","Do not use this as a city bike, I know it's cheap, but get a hybrid. It is not stable dealing with pot-holes, grass, low speeds, or aggressive drivers.Assembly directions are hilariously convoluted (though thankfully the bike itself is a joke to put together) and definitely need to be redone via the IKEA model."
3,"Nice bike, but possibly wrong size?","Everyone who has the yellow, medium bike is it too big for you? I ordered that one and I am a 5' 6"" female. Is it doing fine for all of you? Can anyone give me tips on how to deal with it? Thanks. Nice looking bike for a beginner."
4,Decent Bike,Overall a good buy. The gears seem to have some issues shifting every now and then but other than that this is a good bike.
3,GMC Bike,I like the bike alot. The brakes really need to be upgraded though. The brakes are the onlY bad thing I have to say about the bike.
4,gmc,"This is my second denali bike ( the first one was too big and came broken) I bought a small one and is perfect for me (I'm 5'7) . Really good bike, goes smooth. Brakes suck! do not rely on them, if you can change them, do it, the suck bad. The shifting system is giving me some sounds which idk why, maybe I need to take it for a tune up."
4,Great bike for the price,"This is a definitely not the best bike that you can get, but I think it was a great deal. I got it a few weeks ago to get across my college campus, Georgia Tech, and it's performed admirably. The only problems that I have are the brakes. The location is a little awkward, and they are not the most ""grippy"" brakes, but after two weeks, I got used to it. Another thing is the frame size. I'm 5'7'' and I really shouldn't be riding the medium frame. I have to hop off when I want to stop. But I got used to that as well. However, I wouldn't recommend anyone shorter than 5'9'' riding this. However, you really can't beat the price. Which was the selling point for me."
5,A great bike for the price,"I am pretty particular about what I buy. I have to admit that for the money, this bike is great. It's perfect for my son's first road bike. You can't go wrong with this bike for a growing child.Make sure to check all hardware for tightness. The brake cable wasn't snug and my son could not stop. fortunately, this happened at a relatively low speed and he wasn't hurt. I really consider this to be my fault. Should've checked it myself.Assembly of the handlebars was a bit tricky. I consider myselft to be pretty capable and had a little trouble figuring out how to unfold the cabling and get the handlebars installed.Overall, I'm very satisfied with the bike."
2,Not for us- Not Kid Carrier Friendly,We bought this bike as a father's day gift. Our intention was to smack a toddler seat on it for family rides. (Assumed it would be compatible) Well it's not. We even took it to a specialty bike store to see if we could rig it somehow. But the bike doesn't have the pre-drilled holes or the single bolt to anchor the seat. Other than that the bike would have been fine. (Instructions were a little difficult to understand... need to use your own logic to put it together.
1,Worst Road Bike Ever!,I've been riding for 14 years and looking back on this specific bike I can honestly say that I would never buy nor recommend it to ANYONE!The gear shifting is shotty in both the front and back. The brakes were also cheap and didn't stpo the bike they were supposed to. I'm speaking out of experience when I say all these things because I have bought 4 of these bikes just to see if the reviews were true or not. Bottom line...DONT BUY THIS BIKE PLEASE!
3,GMC Denali Road Bike,"Decent bike. Not what you want if you are planning on racing or triathlons, but a good bike for getting you from A to B. Shifters are awkward and I've had problems getting enough resistance on high gears. Reccomend for beginners, but I'm upgrading to a better, lighter bike, with room for aerobars on the handlebars and toe clips."
2,ehh,Its an ok bike. Good for maybe short rides definitely not a race bike! It has pretty cheap quality gears break easy
4,"Large, Black GMC Denali Road Bike","Excellent bike for the price. It comes partially assembled which is great because it'll only cost about sixty bucks to have the bike assembled and tuned up. It rides great. Brakes are great. I'm 6'3"" and about 190 pounds with 33"" inseam and the bike fits me great. It'd be great for a person from 6' to about 6'4"".Con: changing the gears can be a hassle and somewhat uncomfortable sometimes. inconvenient would be a better word. The local bike shop told me to give the bike about one second to change gears because it doesn't change as fast as a racing bike.The brakes are somewhat low on the handlebars for me.overall, great bike for the great price. i love riding it.Product link:GMC Denali Road Bike"
4,good bike for everyday use,"this is a nice bike..the shifters are kinda weak and not very accurate, but for everyday biking this is great! i use it to get to work/school..it's kinda heavy for a road bike, but then again you're not really paying for a top of the line bike here..it's great for the price you pay."
3,an OK bike,"It is an inexpensive bike! Shifting does leave something to be desired. Back axle has a slight bend. Didn't come with the pedals. I tried to call service but no one returned answers. Too bad, it doesn't look like a bad bike, ride is good."
5,A best buy for an entry level aluminum frame road bike,I just took out the 63.5cm aluminum frame black Denlai road bike after putting it together and it rides and shifts great. I like the fact that I could use it alot more times than a higher priced bike and not worry about someone with bolt cutters stealing it. It's amazing Amazon could sell an aluminum frame 63.5cm 21-speed road bike for $99.99 with free shipping that would cost much more at a local bike shop.
2,IT'S AN OK BIKE!THINK TWICE!,"This bike is nice to look at but that is about all. The bike makes a lot of noises, it's completely a disaster.it's an okay bike if u are not going to bike over 40 miles. i wish i didn't invest in that bike.Was this review helpful to you? (Report this)"
2,horrible,"I thought it would be a decent bike to commute with, but it cannot even do that. Every time I shift gears, the chain goes all crazy and shifts multiple gears at once. Also, even when simply pedaling, once in a while the pedals would skip forward which gets really annoying. Its just a hassle to ride this bike around."
1,Heaviest bike ever,This bike is very heavy. You can only use this bike for riding around the neighborhood and not a good bike for long distances. The components are horrible. The bike works against you if you intend to use it for commuting or racing. Not worth the price...... Very disappointed. I found mountain bikes cheaper and lighter than this bike.
4,awesome,"GMC Denali Road BikeI got the GMC Denali road bike over 2 weeks ago. It is a great bike that looks great. The problems are that when you put to much torque on the peddles the gear will slip,and 7th gear dose not work. the good things are the looks,the speed,and the smooth riding."
4,great entry level bike for the price!,"I became interested in competing in a triathlon, so I started shopping at the local bike shops for a decent entry-level bike. The cheapest ones were still over $400!! So, when I saw this bike on Amazon on sale for $89.99 with FREE shipping I couldn't resist. I had myself measured at the local bike shop to make sure I was getting the correct size and style of bike I wanted.I don't have much to add to the other comments, but I did want to say that the bike wasn't too difficult to assemble (it helps to have someone knowledgeable about bikes to help), and it's a very smooth ride. I was lucky in that there weren't problems with any of the parts. When I called Kent to ask what size allen wrenches I should use, they answered my questions with no problems.The purpose of this bike, for me, is to figure out if I'm really interested in becoming more serious in road biking. This bike is an excellent way to try it out, without breaking the bank."
2,Get what you pay for,"I was initially impressed with the price, look, and decent weight. After a few rides, the cheap components start to show. I am not a professional rider, or even think I will ever make it to a triathalon, however, this bike won't hold up past a stoll in the park. The shifters could never adjust right, skipped gears, and ever slipped the chain a few times. The tires are quite out of round and very unstable at high speeds.I enjoyed riding around with my kids, but on my own training time, this bike worried me. I have taken it back and will spend a few extra bucks to get a good upgrade."
3,Good bike considering the price,"I am not a professional cyclist, I needed the bike to crosstrain and get in shape. I enjoy the bike, the only issue I have is that after I had assembled it, I had to change the brake pads. They simply did not stop the bike. About ten dollars later, I always look forward to my early morning rides."
3,There are better options,"it's cheap but that's about it. , try looking for the ""Schwinn varsity"" for about 50 dollars more you can have a whole lot better bike than this. i have both bikes so i know what I'm talking about. not only does the Schwinn looks better, but also has a big quality difference than this one. when i ride them i can feel about 3 mph difference between them. when buying bikes i would advice adding a couple more dollars than what you intend to spend, because you will easily spend more on accessories and upgrades."
4,Excellent Value,"I'm a newbie cycler, and I wanted a nice, cheap bike for exercise and fitness purposes. I wanted a road bike since I'll be riding on pavement 99% of the time, and this is the cheapest road bike I could find on the Internet at about $150. This bike met all of my requirements in terms of quality, price, and performance. I'm no expert on bikes, but it looks pretty good to me and I've had no problems yet. Only thing I wasn't too excited about was the color - it's gold/yellow. If you don't mind that, you should be very happy with the purchase."
4,Awesome Bike!!!,"Great first road bike...easy to ride and not too expensiveOne of the inner tubes was popped but other than that, it rides very smooth & easy to shift & use...Couldn't ask for anything better!"
3,GMC Denali Road Bike,"This is a great entry level bicycle. I knew next to nothing about bicycles but was in a position where I needed a bicycle to take me to work every day (two miles) and school every other day (eight miles).This bike arrives pre-assembled (for the most part) but be prepared to adjust several functions; such as: the brakes, the crankset, and the chain guard. I spent hours tightening and loosening my chain guard because it was rubbing on my chain, making an awful sound and a vibration I could feel all the way through the bike. I got it to where I can have a decent range of gears, but not what I expected.Also, this comes with somewhat flimsy schrader tubes. I suggest investing in an immediate conversion to presta tubes and buying spares.All around a great entry level road bike; it just needs a little love.Enjoy."
2,heavy slow more like hybrid then road bike,Tire rims did not spin true right out of box. The brakes are slow to stop and are not positioned for quick easy access. You have to squeeze brakes hard to stop on hill. The tires are not thin this was the most disappointing thus not like good road bikes. All components are on the cheap side none are quick release. With this all said it is fairly priced at $169. To get a good road bike you have to pay much more.I should have tried to find a good used road bike instead for the 169 I spent.
1,The sum is just as crappy as its parts!,"I was very excited to receive this bike however I am forced to return it. The front derailer doesn't have enough movement to select all three of the gears so you have to pick either gears 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (so its only a 14 gear bike). The brakes have very little stopping power so if you have to suddenly stop for oh lets say... traffic, then prepare to meet some cars. The rear gears aren't that great either and after a couple days of riding the rear sprockets started slipping and the chain has trouble holding its place. This bike is a mass produced product with inferior parts, sometimes you luck out and everything will work together (all the 5 star ratings) but most of the time things just keep breaking/ falling apart because this bike is built from a spare parts bin.Don't waste your time risking it, this is a DO NOT BUY. I tried to love it but I just can't!"
3,Brakes,"The bike is great, except that I've got a problem with the front brake. It doesn't work at all. Does anyone experience the same problem?"
3,Quick Release and Brakes,The bike looks good but i didn't expect a bike without wheels quick release and those thinks are very important also the brakes aren't good so the manufacturer needes to pay attention to these details and them sent some information about how i can get those quick release done.
2,gmc bike,Cheap bike but ok for the price. The bearings in the crank broke down within 3 weeks of buying the bike. Amazon customer service were v helpful
3,IT TRIED TO KILL ME!!!,"I really wanted to like it, but since the attenpted murder I just can't. Let me start from the beginning. I bought this bike to ride to work. I didn't want anything really fancy or expensive, so I did some window shopping and some research and found this ""gem"". It was totted as an inexpensive, sturdy, bike. I bought it and put it together. Needless to say the first ride I took, ended with the chains skipping the gears and me on asfault. I took it to my local bike shop. They laughing at me and said it is what it is, a piece of crap, but they would look it over. 60 bucks later, the thing still tries to kill me when im throwin out the torque, but it isnt as bad as it could be i guess."
4,Someone help me!,"I'm trying to find a bike for my first ever triathlon. My relay team isn't shooting for a record finish or anything so making sure I have an ultra lightweight, fast bike isn't important. I don't do an extensive amount of biking right now and have only ever purchased a cheap Walmart mountain bike. I've been looking online at several types and websites and am fairly certain I want to purchase a road bike. Would this be a decent bike for me? There's no way I'm going to be able to financially afford a $400 bike so I need to find something that will be cheaper but still a good bike for the price. Absolutely any help would be great!!!"
2,"Good Value, heavy bike.","I bought the bike thinking it was a great value. Tried to tune it myself, wow that was a pain to do. More difficult than any other bike I've owned. There is no suspension and the wheels are 28"". The ride is EXTREMELY stiff, too stiff for me so I sold the bike shortly after I bought it. It has to do with the larger wheels and the steel frame. The aluminum in higher bikes deflects more than steel so aluminum frame bikes ARE a little softer than these steel framed bikes.I'm 5'10"" and I think the large would have fit me better. If you're ok with a stiff ride then go for it, the bike is a good value. Shipping was really fast too."
2,Brings back memories of Windows 95,"UPS delivered the contents intact. The assembly is straightforward but then... Brakes needed adjusting- this was the easy part. Both the rear and front derailleurs needed adjusting and this took a while longer. So, even with the impact of disassembly and assembly, it looks like quality control out of the factory gates is krap. It is upgradable, in the same way that with patience, Windows 95 morphed eventually into 2000 or XP which were more stable. However, given the cost of all you`d want to change by keeping just the frame, one would do better to looks elsewhere. The ride is OK, for what you paid for the bike. Bottom line: If you like tinkering with your bike, this could be an interesting project. It needs persistent massaging, same as Windows 95. If you are not comfortable with doing the adjustments yourself, you may wish to look somewhere else."
1,Not ment for hard rides,This bike is nice to look at but that is about all. I went on what was going to be a 40 mile drive and ended up only going about 18 since the bike broke. I can get the part for free from Kent (when I get all the hoops jumped through) but there is a special tool needed to replace the part. The bike shop wants more that the bike cost to do the repair... So there it sits in my garage awaiting a miricle from the cycling gods.
1,Convince yourself it is real.,"GMC Denali Road BikePlease don't convince yourself that you are buying an actual road bike. Rubber parts are more plastic than rubber. Cheap tires and rims. Looks great though. Aluminum frame. (Just like a beer can). Other than the 4 dollar levers, it's all big box junk parts with pretty paint. It's basically a 49 dollar heap made to look like a road bike. You get what you pay for. It's that simple. If you can justify this in your mind then you'll get what you deserve. Landfill. A new roadbike can be had for under $500. And if you maintain it, the cost will be much less than the Denali. It will have resale, NOT long gone into a recycleing bin."
2,Go to a store and get fitted!,"This bike is sturdy, but honestly you shouldn't be buying a bike off of a website unless you know what you are doing! I made that mistake and even though this bike was right for my height, everything else didn't fit my body. Trust me, go to a store, it's an investment that needs to be taken seriously! I returned it within a week and went to a professional bike retailer and got fitted."
2,Nothing against the bike-don't know til I ride- wish me luck,"(GMC women's road bike) I knew that shipping would be awhile, that wasn't my problem. But I didn't know it would take as long as it did. I finally got my bike, I got it 4 weeks later from a neighbor that I don't even know. It was shipped to the wrong house and left there. Ichecked the address and it was my house, so I don't know what happened with that. Good thing he was honest, it was at his place for a week. Second, I went to the bike shop so they can put it together. I had to pay for 2 intertubes because of a manufacturer deffect on the wheel itself; didn't fit propperly and air kept coming out. I haven't been on the road yet, hopefully it won't fall apart on me. I do like how it looks if that any consolation."
1,Authentic Bicycle Replica,"I'm not sure how anyone could give this thing a good review unless they are very inexperienced and also hadn't ridden the bike much yet. Three piece handlebars? Grip shifters on the bar flats? 30+ lbs for a road bike? I don't (wouldn't) own one but I have repaired MANY of them. There are tons of options in bikes for the same or similar cost that destroy this piece of junk. This isn't some review based on snobbery. This ""bike"" is just a ripoff and someone should say it."
1,Rip off,This is the worst piece of trash I have ever bought. It was essentially like getting my money stolen.
4,Ok bike!,"I got this bike at walmart for 159$It pretty much rock so far. I haven't hada ton of problems. The shifters suck, andso do the brakes, and the tires that come with itaren't real road bike tires. So change the tires,adjust the brakes, and get used to the shifters andits fabulous! I rode 25 miles yesterday."
4,Good quality for its price,I recently bought this bike it came in a box very easy to assemble less then ten minutes. I have taken it on several 40+ mile rides and have had no trouble with it. For the price of the bike the quality can not be beat.
1,poor quality,"When you pay this kind of money for a bike, you know they're skimping somewhere. The tubes are poorly constructed, the welds are ugly, the components are bottom of the barrel. Everything will eventually fall apart on this, and if it doesn't, you're stuck with a heavy bike that you can't upgrade."
1,cheap price cheap bike,"I opted for the cheapest bike and shipping charges and i got what i ask for. The free shipping was great, but I read the shipping eta incorrect the date that was given was the shipping date, about one week from the order date was the actual day the bike was shipped. Got here pretty fast after it was shipped. So expect a two week processing and ship from order date.As i was assembling it I noticed the handle bar wrap was ripped in two different places. I used electric tape to remedy that problem. Put air in the tires rode it around felt okay and sturdy. Next day the rear tire got flat. Not the perfect bike. If you buy this bike be prepared to make some minor adjustments and repairs.Also wanted to note the weird neck and adaptor for the handle bar. Can't figure out why the manufacture would use an oversided neck then an adaptor. Why not just use the correct size. Well I'm over that now. You get what you pay for."
3,Denali road bike,"I got this for my girlfriend who is not a bike rider. It is a decent bike but very entry level with respect to the components. The brake pads are not parallel to the rim and doesn't shift very smoothly. But, for the price not a bad bike to get some miles in and decide if one likes road biking or not."
1,Piece of crap,"This bike was an aweful purchace, the pedal threads stripped out on me after only a week of riding, and i wasn't even riding that hard, most of the protective plastic was shattered when it showed up and the bike never did run to strait."
4,GREAT BIKE DONT LET THE SNOBS stop you from buying,"I was leary of buying this bike because all the people that buy expensive bikes. It is a Great bike for the money.We have been biking for 20yrs and have also purchased high end bike. Got rid of our road biks and kept some others but wanted our road bikes again. But didnt want to invest a lot for 2 bikes. WWell the GMCs fit the bill. Yes I bought my wife a GMC also and she loves her. now she has 2 differnet bikes shr hasnt touched since getting the GMC. BUY IT YOULL LIKE IT!!!Of course Im from an older generation 56yrs old , who doesnt always believe the more you spend for something doesnt mean you are getting better!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"The Large Bike was way bigger than 25"" and the brakes are horrible. Not only because you wont stop but because of their placement on the handlebars.Tube came off of rim on first ride. IT WAS NOT OVER INFLATED.I WISH I COULD REFUND THIS HORRIBLE PIECE OF JUNK BUT unfortunately some minor damage was done while I was assembling it and while i tried to fix the tube because i wanted to use bike.DO NOT BUY THIS BIKE... NOT EVEN WORTH THE $$$ IT COSTS.I am very upset with this purchase and I hope you will avoid this bike."
1,Cyclists BEWARE.,"I received my gmc denal road bike about a week and a half ago, the first day I received this bike the stock tubes blew out after about 20 minutes into riding, then the following day the kick stand on the bike snapped offwhen it was adjusted back up (not exagerating), and on top of these things the chain constantly slips and the brakes are horrible even when adjusted. And when riding one day the allen nut that hold the handle bars and the fork together loosened completely and almosty made me wreck.I guess the saying is true ""you get what you pay for""...I highly DO NOT recommend this bike to anyone, not even a begginer it is dangerous and a number of things go wrong with these bikes. So in conclusion I had to send this bike back after not even 2 weeks of riding it!? unbelievable.Down with wal-mart bikes!"
2,GMC Denali Road Bike,took the bike to get it adjusted for my sons height and they spent over an hour working with the gears. Said it was a really bad gear job. It also came missing a brake pad. the company refunded us without any problem and we bought new pads.
4,Good for commute,"It is a great bike for commuting, very sturdy and easy to assemble. The breaks are away from the gear, so you have to switch hand position to use them. It is not a bike to race or ride 60 miles, because it is a bit heavy, but for me, it works great for my every day 5 mile commute."
2,I sent it back.....,"Beautiful bike, bright colors, nice design...best price ever.I got the 26"" version, it was too tall for me. When I climbed onmy feet were dangling. The brake pad was constantly rubbing againstwheel, even though I constantly adjusted it. The gears would stickin between shifting. I also didn't like the gear shifters, I wouldhave to take my hand off the bar to change gears.Overall it was not a comfortable ride, so I sent it back."
4,Worth it!!!,Nice bike for it price worth it. You need to do few adjustments. Nice brakes. The only bad thing is the seat is cheap. But It is a small detail.
3,Expected better,"I had problems with how they packaged the items because the front rim was ditched,the body of the bike had dents. I would like you to have the option to bubble wrap the item to ship please. I had to pay to adjust the brakes and fix front wheel."
3,Good Bike (Meh on Assembly),"I like this bike, but it's a nightmare as far as who assembled it. if i'd had know I was going to have to pump and extra 100.00 into this, I may have bought in store(probably not) but it just seems like everyday there is somethiing new with it that acts up...I basically feel like it's going to fall apart everytime i use it. I had the shop fix the busted derailer, but there's other stuff that pops up...Yes, good bike...people love it...but the original [partial] assmebler on this was Meh at best."
5,VERY GOOD!!!,"this is A very GOOD bicycle, it is not very expensive but really worth buying!!VERY GOOD!choose this one!You won't regret it"
4,Great bike for the money,"I was sceptical about buying this $160 road bike. After a bit of review reading, I bit the bullet and bought it! I like it and I don't. The handlebar turn shifters are a bit stiff and not really ideal for a road bike. The derailers needed a bit of adjusting and the brake pads needed to be lined up with the rims. Other than that, the bike is pretty decent, taking into consideration that you can't find ANYTHING like it locally (Toronto) for the price. I bought a $100 wheelset that I think was a great upgrade and some clipless pedals ($15 used). After a bit of riding, the cables stretched a bit, which is typical of any bike. A slight re-adjustment is required but overall I like the bike. Make sure you inflate the tires to the MAX psi written on the side-walls for the best performance. I've put just over 300 miles on the bike and really like it. I think I'll be keeping it for a couple years, before I start looking at a lighter one with better components."
4,a good bike with a lot of small problems.,"i don't want to be the bad guy to give this bike a 3 star. it is not fair to compare it to over $500 or even over $5000 bikes. this is a firm bike and ride on it many times. however, it has so many small issues, such as gear change and control, noise from gear and bearing... this bike is not that kind of narrow tire racing road bike. it is likely that kind of hybrid bike which can ride a lot of kinds of road surface. it looks cool."
5,Good Choice,I had to have help in choosing this bike because today fitting the bike to the rider is essential. I bought it on the advice of a young salesman explaining what size and type of bike I needed. This is an excellent choice for riders. It is a simple ride and an easy ride. I am an older rider needing something to help me get back in the exercise routine. I could have spent considerably more money and not gotten nearly the product I got. For those riders that have had bikes in the past that were difficult at best to ride; this is a great choice as it it much more rider friendly than older models of bikes.
4,denali bike review,Shipped quickly with no damage. Easy to assemble. After extensive research this bike is the most bike you can get for the price.Bought the large 63.5cm frame which works perfect for my 33 inch inseam. Rides great and shifts great. The only negative is that you will have to retape the handle bars after the first couple of rides.
3,good for the price,"Pros: light weight, smooth ride, beautifulcons: poor braking, bad gears (dont change smoothly and almost impossible to change gears if you're going slightly uphill)Its a good choice if you dont want to spend much on a bike"
3,Crap shoot,"Look, the bike is great for the price. But if you're looking for something awesome, spend the extra couple of hundred bucks and get a real road bike.This bike is doomed to a number of problems. The brakes aren't great, the shifters don't work well in the higher gears, and overall it's... a crap shoot.I've already had to replace two tires. Whether that's because of the city road conditions or crappy tires is up to you. :D"
2,Not worth the price or effort to even put it togther,"This bike is extremely cheap and heavy. I bought one from Walmart and could only stand to ride it for about 2 days till I took it back. The components are extremely cheap, the bike is very very heavy and the brakes might as well not even be there since they are absolutely awful and dont stop anyways. Save your money and get a nice used road bike or an entry level trek or specialized bike for under 700 new."
2,Not for the Novice!,"This was my first road bike, I don't know a thing about how to fix bikes or why things go wrong with them, therefore I was a novice. I do not recommend this to anyone in the same position. From the day I got it things were wrong. The tire wouldn't stay inflated. Did I say tire, sorry, I meant TIRES! The chain comes off the gears in the rear, and like I said, I don't have a clue why, or how to fix it. If you are not a bicycle repair professional, don't get this bike. On the other hand if you want to spend $200 and learn everything there is to know about how to fix a bike, this is a great on to get."
5,Rides like a Cadillac,My husband says he loves his bike! We go out for long rides and he loves it every time. The packaging made it very easy to put together also.
2,You get what you pay for,"Works as a bike but there are a lot of drawbacks. The crank is already showing signs of cracking after about a year of use (I'm not a very large fellow and unfortunately my legs lack super-human strength) and there's a general feeling of cheapness to the bike. It works fine if you just need a riding around campus bike on the cheap but it will end up requiring work/maintenance quicker than average.The format of the handlebars and the positioning of the gear switching mechanism also limits the number of positions where you can attach a headlight.In sum, if you're going to ride it hard it's not going to last much more than a year or two. It was decent while it worked but now it's sitting in the garage until I can at least replace the cracked pedal crank. I'm too worried that it'll snap at an inopportune time to ride it."
3,GMC Denali 700C Road Bike,"When I bought my Denali, I wasn't sure what I was going to get for $149. So far, I am pleased with the product. I've gone on several 50 mile+ rides and have found the bike to be dependable and ride smoothly. However, the 1st time I rode it I got a flat from a faulty rim strip, which Kent Bicycles gladly replaced.Overall, the bike is a good value and a great bike for beginner cyclists or those looking for an inexpensive road bike."
5,Simply Fantastic,"This bike is amazing. For the price i don't think i could find a better road bike. I bought myself the blue 22.5 inch bike and I love it. I am 5'7"" and the bike fits me fine but i would go with the small frame if you are any shorter than 5'7"". My bike came 5 days after I ordered it. I have never assembled a bike before and I put this beauty together in less than a half hour, it was more simple than putting together small grill i just bought. I bought this bike for exercise and just got back from a 20 mile ride feeling great. I highly recommend this bike."
4,"19"" Denali Gold Road Bike","Very nice bike for the money! Will get another one for my son!Enjoy riding it very much! And also love the gold color! Shifts easy, and I like being able to see what geer I'm in.Great for people that are a little smaller then average."
4,"great bike for the price, quick shipping","i got this for my boyfriend for xmas and was very impressed with amazon's speedy shipping. . . arrived two days early! i was worried about putting it together since we have no experience riding bikes, and the instructions didn't help much, but it was pretty intuitive. The back is assembled, so you can use that to assemble the front. so far so good."
1,Shipping/packaging substandard.,"I just received the box today. Opened it and one of the pans was totally shattered. There was no styrofoam to protect the glass and it was in a box too big for the item so it could move around and it only had paper protecting it. The box had been pierced by something during shipping and that is likely the problem. I am totally dissatisfied with the US Postal Service as a shipping option. This is the second time in less than four years that I have received something damaged. I will get my money refunded and shop locally for fragile items such as this from now on, instead of coming here. I am usually pleased with Amazon. I hope they are reading this."
5,Highly recomend!,This product is excellent. The only down fall is that it is a little heavy for us to throw for our german sheppard but that is NOT a problem with the product but the user.
1,Very toxic toy! Makes dogs VERY sick,"Please be advised ... we bought this toy for our pitt because we heard it was super tough. It was great until he started tearing it apart with his teeth and shredding it. Okay, no big deal, he shreds lots of toys which is why we bought it in the first place. I took the toy away, but about 2 hours later he started throwing up ... and throwing up and throwing up! Poor puppy got sick at least 9 times in the space of one hour. I did some research and found that this toy was making a lot of dogs very sick. Look it up on rufftoyreviews.com.This is a very dangerous toy."
1,Astonishing!,"Astonishing that anyone could like this hoary potboiler. To call the characters 2 dimensional, would be to give them one dimension too many. The story was poorly written and stank (synopsis: Rah, rah, rah, USA, sis, boom bah!). Astonishing how may rounds of automatic gunfire the plane took without explosive decompression. Astonisihing how the characters slid from one plane to another on a rope (haw, haw, haw!). Astonishing that the director of Das Boot would sink to this crummy level.And most astonishing of all is how many reviewers thought this movie rated 5 stars!Truly awful movie. See it on free TV only, don't even bother to rent it. Besides the commercials will lessen the inanity of this turkey."
1,Crash And Burn,"The worst film I have ever seen. Absolutely terrible! You can't care about any of the characters, especially those who are shot within minutes of their first appearance, and the countless explosions and bad one-liners leave you with a headache to beat the band. After suffering through this dreck, the only thought in your head that is still audible will be, ""Why, Harrison, why?"""
1,Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!!!,"This is, quite possibly, the worst movie ever made. The utter absurdity of the premise is only outmatched by the absolute stupidity of the events that follow. In the realm of Hollywood movies about impossible things that miraculously happen with aircraft, this one deserves top awards. I give one star because you can't give zero, or negative stars. Beyond ridiculously abominable."
1,Embarrasing...,"After movies like Sabrina, Regarding Henry, and, of course, the legendary Raiders of the Lost Ark, what a terrible movie! Just another overdone airplane movie that does not compare to the older movies about airline hijacking. I am so glad I waited until it came out on cable, because it was hyped to be so much more than it really was."
4,"Finally, released on Blu-Ray in the US!","This is a great film, and it will be even better on Blu-Ray. I am excited that this is finally being released on Blu-Ray in the US.Harrison Ford turns in a great role as the President.The TrueHD Audio should sound awesome - especially the action scenes.I highly recommend.EDIT: I have now seen this movie and it is AWESOME! The video and audio are superb."
2,"""Executive Decision"" was better","Credibility. You must think in terms of credibility. No motive was given for the secret service agent to turncoat on the president.This is vital. The audience must know why he's turned traitor. Allow a foreign camera crew on board? No way, Jose. Harrison Ford has a gun on one of the bad guys so he won't reveal his position? I thought these guys would dearly love to die for their cause. And the parachute scene? People dropping in a parachute for the first time wouldn't be grinning from ear to ear. If you like airplane hijack movies then ""Executive Decision"" is much better. The much underused David Suchet plays a splendidly hammy and campy villian. And who wants to miss seeing Steven Segal get 'blown away'?"
4,"Great action, mediocre acting","This is a great action film. The acting is pretty terrible though (except for Gary Oldman, he's the ONLY one who adds some dignity to the bunch) and it's so bad you might even get mad at these actors. Still, as everyone has pointed out, the sound is amazing, and the non-stop action will keep your heart-pounding."
4,great action movie,Great transfer onto BD. Harrison Ford great job and how can you go wrong with gary oldman as the bad guy.
4,The president fights back!,"Harrison Ford plays a US President that has traveled to Russia to make a deal with the Russians to fight terrorism, and to seal the fate of a rogue ultranationalist, former Soviet general. When terrorists supporting that general slip aboard and then take over Airforce One, the president and his family are in danger.The action is good, and the bravado of Ford as the US president is exciting. I have to admit, however, that the believability of the entire story is pretty sketchy. There are quite a few holes in the plot, the largest being the lack of an explanation about why a top secret service agent, the one over the President's security detail, would ever help terrorists.Even so, the drama and action are good.Those things together make for a good, but not completely outstanding show.4-stars...that's it...and perhaps a rather weak 4 stars at that."
3,What would they have called the sequel?,"Air Force One (1997) Harrison Ford is the President of the United States. Gary Oldman is a hardliner Russian who has just hijacked the title vehicle, and off we go in the new thriller from director Wolfgang Petersen (In the Line of Fire). Although it obviously has echoes of a Die Hard movie, with ex-Special Forces Prez Ford playing cat and mouse throughout the plane with Oldman's minions, this one stays sharp, smart, and entertaining, thanks to a good script and sure footed direction. Also helping is a fantastic cast, including Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, William H. Macy (Fargo), Xander Berkeley (Terminator 2: Judgment Day), Dean Stockwell (Blue Velvet), Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot) and Timothy Carhart (Beverly Hills Cop III). The action and suspense are plentiful, though it possibly goes on slightly too long, maybe sticking in one crisis too many before the end credits. Still in all, that's a minor quibble, and this is still a fine flick to check out!"
5,I WOULD VOTE FOR THIS GUY!,"harrison ford is certainly better atportraying a president than anythingthat the country will have in the nearfuture.ford makes you believe(almost)that he actually could take on a 747full of terrorists that wiped out hisentire secret service detail,and defeatthem thoroughly.this is the kind ofaction movie that DVD was made for.the picture quality & special effectswill spoil you for wasting $8.00 pluscarfare,popcorn & soda,money to go toa movie,when you can see the same thing at home,a lot cheaper."
2,Silly thriller,Typical Hollywood thriller ... The plot is ridiculously predictable and some action scenes just don't make any sense. Yawwwnnn
4,Strangelove Redux?,"Just as Dr. Strangelove bordered on the impossible (or did it?), this movie follows an implausible track and makes one feel more unsafe by the day. No Peter Sellers black comedy here. Remember also that this film was issued 4 years prior to 9/11. The true irony is that today in 2007, many people,I suspect, would feel safer with Harrison Ford in the Oval Office and having George Bush and Dick Cheney in a mid-air shootout with subversives over the European plain. In any kind of gunfight, take a Texan and a Wyoming man every time."
4,Worth A Look,"There were a lot of gaps in the plot but, then when isn't there? Lots of action, nail-biting suspense and another chance to see a sterling performance by Harrison Ford. My only real complaint was that Gary Oldman couldn't be a good guy..even once."
1,Mislabeled as wide screen,"This is not a review of the movie, rather Amazon's misrepresentation. The description for this movie clearly says the aspect ratio is 2.35:1 -- that is wide screen. A few lines above that is says:Format: Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, NTSCSo ""Full Screen"" is buried. I get the DVD and to my great disappointment it says ""1.33:1"". Yes, it actually is full screen.Amazon lied! I will be returning this DVD immediately.These descriptions should have a big red: WARNING, FULL SCREEN -- INCOMPLETE MOVIE ENCLOSED! to keep people from being tricked into purchasing full screen movies."
4,A Very Entertaining Movie!,This is a good movie from start to finish. Harrison Ford plays the hero role to the limit. Gary Oldman plays an absolutely mean and scary villain. He shows no remorse about shooting an unarmed hostage or using violence. The plot of this movie is outstanding. The idea that these Russian thugs could use the disguise of journalists was unique. Evev the secret service agent who goes bad is portrayed as being wormy. The ending makes Harrison Ford out to be a hero. A very good movie.
4,Amazing!,I luved this movie because it was very suspensful. One time I thought Harrison Ford was going to be captured but I would have never expected him to make the jets fire at the plane. I think that was pretty realistic.
1,"Good lord, what a stinker",It may have seemed pretty good when it came out but in retrospect this is one lousy movie. Clearly high raters are rah rah Americans. Much overacting on almost everyone's part. Harrison is just horrible. Actually he's never been very good has he?
2,Once is enough for a film that everyone has seen a thousand times before...,"I'm just tired of movies that have no individuality. They don't even try to attempt something remotely original, and that seems down into their casting decisions. How many times do we need to see Gary Oldman play a creepy villain? Honestly, how many times do we need to see Harrison Ford play a Presidential figure of some sort? Even Glenn Close gets type casted in those `women who wish they were as powerful as men' roles. That is the big issue with `Air Force One', there is nothing original here. The story is preposterous and pretty straightforward with no real stimulation. It doesn't make a lot of sense and yet it is forgivable action fluff for the most part really. The action scenes are effective and some of the visuals are nicely constructed, but the tension just doesn't live up upon multiple viewings, and really with a film this redundant in basically everything it isn't worth watching more than once."
1,not even good to laugh at,"There aren't very many movies I outright loathe. There were so many times during this movie that my jaw just dropped at the stupidity of it that I wonder whether I might have missed the point - is this some Strangelovesque ironic masterpiece, and am I the dumb literal sucker? But of course that's not true (the first part, at least).The typical argument in defense of a film like this is, ""Of course it's stupid. It's an action movie."" Yes: even the good action movies tend to be stupid. This one, though, is stupid but has nothing to recommend it. The patriotism is simplistic, insipid, and insulting. The plot is trash, the characters trash, the action trash. The movie doesn't even make sense within its own reality - suspension of disbelief fails you.What an awful, awful film. This is the kind of movie that makes me look suspiciously at anyone who thought it was good. I wish there were a no-star option."
1,Sooo Unrealisticccc!!!!,"What kind of plot is this? They land the plane and then take back off when they're not even on the runway. I'm sorry this is just a little too impossible for me. Six Russian terrorists just happen to get on Air Force One unnoticed, please. One of the president's, most trusted and highly scrutinized, secret service detail is a traitor.There's nothing wrong with a fictional account, but at least make it one we can half-heartedly believe.What were you thinking Harrison? This was a ""B"" movie plot at best!"
1,A very bad film with some very good actors,"This film is a real dissapointment. Harrison Ford gives a credible performance as the President and Gary Oldman pulls off his villain role with panache. But this movie simply doesn't work. Overall the film is completely illogical and frankly a bit too patriotic, especially for someone who comes from Europe. Maybe logic isn't exactly what people are looking for when they watch a ""no-brainer"", but this film is really too much."
1,Headache-inducing Fare.,"This movie is so rancid it will appeal mainly to the brain-dead. Any genuine action-movie fan will recoil at the ridiculous over-the-top action scenes: all visual hyperbole and grating melodrama, that it becomes nothing less than a self-parody of a thriller. All that was missing was the cast from Monty Python and, of course, Leslie Nielson to pass this off as comedy of absurd proportions."
1,Why couldn't they have just let it CRASH?,"One of the most important aspects of a movie like this is for the film to make you actually care about the people who are held hostage. This film failed miserably in this endevour. If they'd killed everyone onboard, including Ford, I couldn't have cared less. You may get the idea I didn't like this film... and you would be mistaken. It's not that I didn't like it......it's that I DESPISED it.Complete TRIPE, with final ""cliffhanging"" sequence that is so hilariously moronic it had me laughing uncontrollably."
2,Unbelievable (literally),Fairly entertaining but the President's prowess was a little over the top. What's even more ridiculous (and sickening) is that the Vice President is a WOMAN! What will those hollywood liberals think of next?
1,President Wooden Head,"I saw this movie in the theater and, although I thougth it was stupid, I enjoyed it. I just watched the last 1/4 of it on TV just now. STUPID movie. Harrison Ford looks like he's drugged or constipated throughout the entire movie. He's gotten in the bad habit of narrowing his range of emotions from his usual A-to-B to an annoying A.SPOILER (although, how can you spoil this piece of rotten fruit any more?)William Macy plays a pilot. At the end of the movie, the president takes the helm of the crippled plane while Macy sits beside him in the co-pilot's seat. Shouldn't that have been the other way around?Glenn Close plays an embarrasingly weak vice president."
3,UNNESSARY VIOLENCE AND PROFANITY,"THE PLOT WAS GREAT,HOWEVER THE GUN PLAY WAS A BIT TO REAL AND SUGESTIVE FOR ME. WE ARE LIVING IN SOME VIOLENT TIMES IE CULUMEBINE , AND WACO ETC THE LINE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG AND GOOD AND EVIL IS BLURRED.EVEN WHEN JOHN WAYNE SHOT A GUY I DIDN,T CRINGE AS MUCH...."
2,"Enough cheese to start a, um, cheese store.","It may star Harrison Ford, and may be directed by Wolfgang Petersen, but this block of limburgher's action is borring, and the script is hideous. Throughout the movie I began to hate the capable-of-anything swiss-army-knife-of-a-hero more than anything else. The only reason to watch this movie is for the always excellent Gary Oldman, who plays an enraged Russian."
2,I wish I could say I liked it!,"I love Harrison Ford Films. I love good action films. I love cold war-ish plots. BUT, this film lives up to none of those descriptions. Ford is flat, the action is unrealistic and childish. The plot is outlandish and ends implausibly. I tried to like it but it let me down. 69/100 D"
2,Independence Day meets Airport,"Did the makers of ID4 consult on this film? It sure seemed liked they did. This movie had so many rediculous, stupid scenes in it, it was almost comical. I know playing the president of the United States is a great character to portray, but Harrison Ford should really be more critical of the scripts he accepts. The scene where the presidnent's secretary is floating down in her parachute has got to be one of the most ludicrous shots ever captured on film. This is an action film, however it's just a really stupid action film. Sappy, confusing, melodramatic, and rediculous are just a few words that describe this movie. Oldman, Close, and some good character actors are horribly wasted. Great premise, awful film."
4,IT IS VERY GOOD,I THOUGHT THAT THIS MOVIE WAS A TEAR JERKING AND HEART GRABBING MOVIE. i BOUGHT IT ALMOST 1 1/2 YEAR AGO AND I STILL WATCH IT
2,Not that good,"It's a boring script and the acting is just plain bad - Harrison has one good believable moment, but Glenn Close and Gary Oldman can't manage to pull it off. The drama at Washington about whose going to be in control of the situation is ridiculous. Wait to see it on cable, it's not even worth a rental price."
4,Great Action flick wrapped in honor,"There are some unrealistic elements to this movie, but only when you stop and think about it. It's an action movie and there will always be some stretches of reality. Harrison Ford delivers as does his supporting cast. It will pull you into the story without any real trouble, you will find yourself routing for the President and telling the evil guys ""take that"". In the end, you will feel good about it and you may even be inspired by it. Enjoy!"
3,Poor realism.,"I used to remember this film as being pretty good, and the performances of Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman are enjoyable, but there are parts of the plot that are those 'oh come on' moments that no audience should buy in to. And the special effects are pretty cheesy, with some really bad airplane manuevers. The whole scene where Air Force One lands and takes-off again in the heat of the hijacking is just awful... totally unrealistic."
4,Excellent Entertainment!,As a new critic it was a honor reviewing this film. Harrison Ford showcased his talent in Air Force One. Intense performence also from Gary Oldman and a score percisely matching each scene.Blockbuster special effects taking you inside the cockpit like your experiencing it all. With exact detail to the acually plane. Not much else to say becuase I'm speechless. Must see.
4,I liked it!!!!!,"I first saw this film on ABC, and I enjoyed it,my little sisters didnt like it very much, but I did,Great Peformance by Harrison Ford.Filled with stunts and action expacially on a plane."
4,Good action!,"Ok, I will admitt to the fact that this movie is pure fiction, and has nothing to do with ""the real deal"". But who cares? It has a good plot, although it is a bit far out. This movie only aimes to be 2 hours of good old action, and it absolutely dilivers!"
4,"Great, caliber action movie","Great movie. Lots of action, suspense, and a little humor.Definetely good! Only problem: Harrison Ford is his best in his role but...THE PRESIDENT FIGHTING TERRORISTS? The President? Anyway, still good movie to rent or buy.I also saw Con Air and I think Air Force One is better.Yes, Con Air was fun. The only problem: COn Air doesn't have that much action.Air Force One is awesome! Go buy it now!(Also, Gary Oldman is great as a terrorist. Better than the Fifth Element."
5,"I don't like action movies, but. . .",". . .I liked this one. Of course this is the president we'd all like to have, a loving father, a stunning fighter, and great one-liners for any life threatening situation. This movie was suspense from beginning to the end, and chances are you already know that, cause who likes action has seen this film."
5,One of Ford's best movies!,"Ford plays the presedent of the US. His plane (Air Force One) gets hijacked. Glen Close plays the Vice Presedent and she is down in the White House while all this is going on. The presedent's protector is on the antitaginist's side.William H. Macy plays a General who has to protect the Pres. through the whole movie. At the end the Pres.,his family,and all the other hostiges get off safe and sound right before the plane crashes. On a sader note, William H. Macy gets shot three times in the chest. Ask anybody whose seen it they will say it was a pretty good movie."
2,just another action cliche,"Air Force One had some good action, decent actors in Ford and Oldman, and a few special effects. However, the plot not very interesting. I thought Executive Decision was similar but much better. If you like Harrison Ford or a little action, rent the movie, don't buy it."
1,JCardona,"The one star is for the blu-ray edition of this movie, not for the movie itself (which otherwise I consider to be one of the best action movies I have ever seen).The blu-ray edition is too grainy and has very bad color saturation and low contrast. Worst of all, the digital scenes of air combat with Soviet (Ukrainian) jet fighters are just horrible: blurred sores on screen.It is a shame that an otherwise fine film like this was released in Blu-ray without making the necessary upgrades to ensure that some scenes would not look like crap when viewed in high definition.Save your money and wait for a future version of this movie that is properly transferred to a high definition format."
2,Better wrapping needed,"The disc case was crushed during transport. The disc itself is intact but it suffers from some scratches.Given the low price, I won't ask for much but one extra layer of bubble wrap would be appreciated."
3,Fast Action -- but plenty of absurdities!,"I really want to like AF One but, the screenplay is horrible, the acting is wooden -- especially on the ground with the Vice President Glenn Close going at with an Alexander Haig wanna-be (I'm in control here!)Wolfgang Petersen is a great action director-- the action screnes and the flying sequences rate 4 stars. Production values are first rate.The DVD itself is nicely packaged and the 5-1 Dolby Digital Transfer and the Video sharpness rate 5 stars. Crank up the volume! But crank it down for the silly melodramatic dialog."
4,This action thriller will keep you at the edge of your seat.,"The airplane carrying the US President gets hijacked and the president may be the only person who can save the hostage and get the plane down.This is an unrealistic action movie (unfortunately it doesn't seem quite as unrealistic anymore). But if you don't mind unrealistic action movies, which I don't, I am sure you will be very entertained by this movie. It's well written, and very thrilling, with good actors, especially Harrison Ford and Glenn Close. I have seen few action thrillers that were more entertaining than this one. It kept me at the edge of my seat for two hours and a couple of minutes. I highly recommend it! This is action at its best!"
3,Harrison Ford's Got My Vote...,"...because he is one mean-old President when he gets his Irish up! When terrorists take over AirForce One, it's up to the President himself to subdue the enemy. Suspenseful from start to finish, although feminists should take umbrage at the indecisiveness displayed by the female Vice President who's willing to placate the evil-doers. Notwithstanding that, just the kind of patriotic movie to fire up every red-blooded American."
5,Just An Observation,"Everyone knows by now that this movie is about an American president (played by Harrison Ford) who must fight for the lives of his family and staff on an Air Force One that has been taken over by terrorists. It's a great movie; I had seen it on TV one weekend and had to buy it.But here's the thing: the product description is not quite right. While this DVD is fullscreen, it's not the 1.85:1 that's it is said to be. I know, a truly minor, even nitpicky little thing, but some people actually worry over such things. I do. I was happy to find that this *is* actually fullscreen which it wouldn't have been if the product description was right about the aspect ratio.'Ron"
4,Air Force One,This is a stunning movie. It has enough action to hold a guy's interest and enough story line to hold a woman's. Making it a great date night movie. And the story is clean enough that if the kids walk in it is ok too.
4,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I found this film to be highly entertaining, although somewhat unrealistic. I can accept this because, as a work of fiction, it is precisely that--unrealistic. It had its moments of implausibility, but overall these were forgiveable since we get to see a President who is honorable, decent, and faithful to his beliefs and family--another huge point of fiction considering the current administration. The plane is a bit different from the real thing (so I have been told), but that's ok. Nothing presented in the plane is ""beyond belief."" Even the ""bullet resistant"" cabin is possible. The movie is about ""What if..."" Enjoy it for what it is."
4,Excellent but INcomplete,"Schaum's Outline of Intermediate Algebra 1997 Edition is a clear and helpful text to master intermediate algebra.The authors with long experience in teaching Algebra have written a text that is written in simple and clear language.They even think along with you the student in the section on 885 Solved Problems.They also provide a section on Study Skills for Algebra, really exceptional in textbook writing.Nevertheless, I give the text a 4-star as it does NOT cover sections on Intermediate Algebra : Conic sections, Permutations and Combinations, Hyperbolas, Ellipses. Also, the section on Matrices is basic, not well developed.But, it is the only book you will need to understand and succeed in what it covers in Intermediate Algebra."
5,Schaum's Outline of Intermediate Algebra,"Great tool too have, especially if you haven't had Algebra in over 16 years!"
4,as expected,shipped and arrived as scheduled. individually packed and fit perfectly. Don't know whether filter is working as the rating indicated but certainly feel much better with a clean filter. Will purchase this product again.
2,Caution: This Is Strictly For ESL Students,"This title is really misrepresented as being for general use. In fact, it is strictly for those who are well along in the process of learning to speak and understand English."
2,Hard to use without the small pencil,I bought this for my business because it is touch screen but the screen is not that responsive. You need really tiny hands to hit the right item.
4,Pockets on my desktop,"I've been enamored with the Moleskine line of products for a few years and this item is no exception. I have a small version of this book that I keep receipts in and it works great. I am reluctant to even label the tabs, I like it so much."
2,Not what I expected.,This software was not as user friendly as I expected. I don't think it's easy to use at all and it didn't have all the features I was expecting. I eventually ended up buying Adobe Photoshop.
1,"Kiki in the 60's , But A Bootleg","This CD has been out for years, released by the ironically named MARGINAL RECORDS. It's taken from vinyl, and sounds okay. This "" label "" has issued dozens of unauthorized CD's that many think are legitimate releases. This will only do for someone who wants a CD to play . If you have Kiki's first 2 US albums - "" PATTERNS "" and "" GREAT EXPECTATIONS "" on vinyl, stick to that, and skip this bootleg with 1 page artwork. The cover is a reproduction of her "" I'M KIKI DEE "" UK LP, which was released as "" PATTERNS "" in the US. Sound quality is much better on the LP's."
5,Best of Brands!,"We researched all different formulas and actually started our baby on Enfamil for times when I needed to supplement. Then we tried Bright Beginnings and found that it mixed easier and not to be gross, but him bm's smelled a lot better than when he had the Enfamil -- think it was just easier for him to digest. He is now on the follow-on formula since he is eating solids. We haven't had any issues whatsoever with this formula and think its a great bargain."
5,I love this watch!,"Repeat..I love this watch. I bought this for the tide graph and for the metal dress band to replace my Casio Illuminator, another great cheap watch for boating etc. I use the tide graph all the time for boating and fishing. The metal band is nice enough to wear for work and dress so I now wear it all the time. I took the watch to my local jeweler to have it sized as I had trouble doing that myself without the needed very small screwdriver. There are instructions on the net for how to take out links yourself but my jeweler only charged me $5 and threw in a new fibre band for my old Illuminator. For the price, I'm not afraid to wear the watch boating. If I smash it, I'll just buy another one. Can't do that with my Rolex. I have people ask me why I bought another expensive dress watch and I just smile and tell them it cost me fifty bucks. B-)"
3,little bit disappointing,"in general this watch has a good design with bluish tint, but if you go further in details you'll definitely notice some lacks..first of all, it has no a seconds arrow, the cheap price cannot be the aceptable reason for this.The darklight is TOTALY weak, while it takes some time to figure out what the time is, yet u even cant see the date in the dark, because the light doesnt reach the lower digital display part. and the yellow light color on the blue design looks very awful.And the ""10 year battery life"" slogan on the watches looks like cheezy ad. i wish they left this area empty rather than write such thing.fast delivery for some extra bucks."
5,WALTER PAYTON,"WHEN WALTER PAYTON WAS A CHILD, HE DIDN'T LIKE THE GAME OF FOOTBALL. HE LIKED BASEBALL. WALTER PAYTON LIVED IN SOUTHERN MISSIPPI, AND WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL AT J. JEFFERSON HIGH. HE WENT TO COLLEGE AT JACKSONVILLE STATE UNIVERSITY. AFTER COLLEGE HE PLAYED FOR THE CHICAGO BEARS. WALTER PAYTON MADE THAT TEAM, HE GOT THEM TO THEIR FIRST SUPERBOWL. THE BOOK WAS SO DESCRIPTIVE. IT TOLD EVERYTHING. THE BOOK WAS GREAT. I LOVED IT, I JUST WISH EVERYONE COULD BE LIKE WALTER PAYTON."
4,Seiko generally makes a good watch,"I've had one Seiko or another for over 30 years, now. This one promises to be a good replacement for my old one, now past 20, which was acting up.Pros: the flexible wristband; the chunkier feeling of the watch.Cons: the crown doesn't seem to want to stop in the middle position, which controls the day/date settings. This is a complete nuisance and a fairly important flaw, which cost the watch a star in my rating."
3,Nicely developed characters and great first half.,"It starts off very well, the story draws you in immediately and I really liked the main character. It could have been a five star book, but for me persnally, the story fell apart in the second half with the super soldiers. The battle, as I read it and drew it in my head, seemed a little silly to me. But through it all I couldn't help pulling for the main character and the hope of a new beginning. If you like sci-fi, this is definately worth reading."
3,Good read,"Though dated the material holds up well. Quite a contrast to the movie,which is usually the case. Now that women are allowed in battle gave it a touch of poignancy."
3,I enjoyed this book because of the political views.,"Anyone who fears a world war should read this book. It is obvious that the author knows a lot about politics and is well read. This book presents an interesting main character, good plot, great setting, and believable back up characters to create a dynamic read overall."
5,A classic...very inspiring and moving tale..,These novel by David Brin is one of the most inspiring story he has ever written.The Postman is unlike other SF novels which emphasis on technology.The Postman is about hope and redemption.A very moving story.Keep up the good work Brin!
4,Really good read,"I didn't know what to expect with this book was certainly happy that I read it. All I had ever hear was that it was a bad movie. Now I will watch the movie and see if it really is or not.About the book though... A very deep story that, while not as detailed as most apocalyptic stories, has a really strong and likeable lead character.The complexity of the story is what I found so appealing. The lies that are told from the Restored United States to the Cyclops added a layer to what could have been an average story.I did not like the politics of the book. It seemed to be trying to convey a comment on American history that seemed to be stretching at best. I was also not to fond of the ending. There seems to be something that was trying to be said that would have been better if the author had just came out and said it. Maybe I just didn't get it.Overall a very good read."
5,"It's been a long time, but I still remember this book.","I see a book as well worth reading when, years later, you can still remember the characters and plot. This is one of the few books that stands out for me. I can remember scenes in the book, interactions between characters and the premise. I cannot tell you how it stacks up against other of it's genre, because this is probably the first post-apocalyptic book I read and thus had a big impact on me. But it's been years and I can still remember the changes that happened to the main character as he traveled the crazy new world.I am reading a much newer book calledThe Passage: A Novel, now. It's a similar ""throw back of civilization"" type novel. It is longer than Postman, but has a few similar concerns. Good books both of them, if you like science fiction with introspective angles."
3,So-so apocalypse fiction,"I love end-of-the-world fiction. My picks for the best of the genre include ""The Stand,"" ""On the Beach,"" ""The Day of the Triffids"" and ""Lucifer's Hammer."" Unfortunately, ""The Postman"" just isn't up to the standards set by these works. For one thing, the narrative ark takes some twists and turns into some unusal, but not at all together satisfying directions. For another, several key moments in the plot are based on non-too-plausible scenes of the hero overhearing conversations of his adversaries. Some of the action scenes are not terribly believable, and the ending of the book reads like a cliched Western. Nevertheless, Brin does pack his novel with a number of interersting ideas and notions that at least make it worth reading for those with an interest in this particular genre."
5,A tour de force from David Brin - the Postman delivers!,"Having seen (and liked) the movie, I was really pleased with the book. I have read and enjoyed many of the books from David Brin. He is a very talented writer and his character development is terrific. I guess I was amazed at the extent of the detail and intricate plot development offered in this work. In retrospect, It made the movie seem very one-dimensional..."
4,Nothing like the movie!,The book is nothing like the movie! It allows your imagination much more latitude to fill in and imagine what you might do in this guys situation and how others totally out of his control affect his circumstances. It was a good read!
3,Alright,"Worth reading for the apocalypse fan, but not a life altering book. The good news is that the story had enough differences from the movie that a reader will be surprised here and there with the happenings."
3,robuster,"I bought this book based on how well I liked the movie. I disappointed to find the book was a very little like the movie.One of the few times the movie was better then the book,at least for me.Now having put that behind me,the book was interesting in it's own right.Gordon finds a Postman's uniform and in his desperate struggle to stay a live, he puts it on and the story begins. The clothes give the people Gordon meets in his travels hope that the old days are not gone forever.In this hope Gordon finds the man with in himself that he has all ways wanted to be. Not bad,but not great either.The price point could be better considering how long ago it was published."
2,Drop your expectations.,"Those looking for a novelized version of the infamous Costner vehicle may be surprised/disappointed by its source material. The short novella bears little resemblance to the film other than its title and post-apocalyptic setting. That being said, readers who enjoy day dreaming about the world sans-civilization could do worse than this simple little story with its non-threatening prose and stock characters. Always remember, there is no shame in putting down Faulkner and wasting an afternoon with a little harmless trash....G.R.R. Martin can attest."
3,Good. I don't need to see the movie (nor should I...),"I found the book a quick and easy read. The story premise is an interesting one, and in light of the current militia and survivalist movements, it does make one think. But the book seems to run out of gas 3/4 of the way, and although the isolationist tone of the story is the focus, in the end, you wonder, ""Yeah, but what happens to the rest of the country?"" I can only surmise that in the end, Kevin Costner gets a hold of the postman's badge and the whole thing turns into an utter disaster..."
5,Underrated new classic,"This is going to be one I have to read every few years. A classic of life during nuclear winter. Civil society in America has died in a slow battle with post-war chaos, hypermilita groups, and famine. It's a wonderful tale of a professional liar, a traveling actor who becomes mired in his deceptions and in the process starts a legend that might lead the survivors back to civilization. The first step is the simple act of starting a postal service. There is interesting musing about feminism in this story. I found this narrative to be make the book worth it alone. Also, the book is a great travel guide through some scenic spots in post-apocalyptic Oregon."
4,Don't be put off by the movie!,"One of the best books I've read all year. Brin's story flows with a grace and power little seen these days. His skillfull use of plot device and interludes ties the story together and reveals it's depth. This isn't just the story of a few minor skirmishs in hope-starved Oregon, this is the story of the history, present and future of the world. Brin conveys great personality and belivability in each and everyone of his characters. It will chalenge your way of looking at the world and at history. Highly recomended!"
4,"""Who will take responsibility?""","David Brin's The Postman uses the post-holocaust type of novel to send several relevant messages among them: the importance to take social responsibility, the urgent need of hope and the value of things that we usually take for granted.Brin's novel might not be brilliantly written, and it certainly doesn't have any kind of epic scope. Indeed its scope is quite locally limited and the writing is simple and straight-forward. Nevertheless, the brilliant idea of a made-up Postman bringing new light into a broken country and the weight of the messages that are delivered makes this book a fine read to be recommended."
5,For want of a toothbrush...,"Of all the ways in which you might die after a nuclear holocaust,I had not considered the possiblity that something as mundane as periodontal disease might get you in the end. This is a truly insightful, thought provoking book."
3,Movie is actually a better story than the book,"I know that many people have panned the movie based on this book, but frankly of the two, the characters in the movie are much better drawn and developed than the book. The movie has its slow moments but the book was more than slow, it frankly just stalled and I had to force myself to finish it. In the end I did not much care about what happend to the characters. The movie is very under rated and is a nice jewel about ""hope"" over coming cynicism. Since we live in a country full of cynical critics that is probably the main reason the movie was panned. I would not recommend the book but would recommend the movie."
2,Not his better novels,"Just another post-apocalypse view of the future, and not a very good one at that. I saw the movie and it was even worse. I couldn't believe they made a movie of one of his poorer works. I wish someone would make a movie of this Startide Rising/Uplift War series."
3,A marginal effort,"I read this book a couple of years ago and just decided to write this after I saw a commercial for the film version. This book was nothing more than just ""OK"". Brin was able to hold my interest long enough for me to finish it and that's it. Not totally boring, but definitely not worth a second read. Here's the story in a nutshell: Gordon Krantz survives the Doomwar and after a particularly close encounter with death dedicates his life to attempting to restore America to its former greatness by lying to everyone he meets. His lies cause the deaths of nearly every really strong character in the book. Yet this deceiver has the nerve to whine on and on about ""who will take responsibility?"" as though he is the only person left on the blasted planet who is trying to do more than just survive. What conceit! Don't buy it, go to the library and check it out."
2,A little disappointing...,"The only time I can honestly say I enjoyed the movie better than the book. I suppose my biggest gripe is style...the author comes off almost pretentious at times. Plus the thought of ""neo-hippies"" as some kind of scientist/artist/wood elf kind of makes my stomach turn. All the hippies I ever met smell bad and have no job.Also, I guess it might be kind of picky, but count how many times he uses the word ""irony"". It's just about every other page. Sorry. Loved the movie though."
1,I was surprised....,"When I picked up tis book, I expected it to be another one of David Brin's interesting novels. And, when I started to get into the book, I hated it. I thought, maybe, that the book would be different from the movie, which I also didn't like, but it wasn't."
1,Poorly written and cliched sci-fi,"As a self-professed post-apocalyptic fiction aficionado, I was very disappointed by this book. It cannot compare to some of the classic apocalyptic novels. Poorly written, very painful to read. The characters are wooden, the plot is simple, the dialogue is artificial, and there is nothing about this book that sets it apart from any other post-apocalyptic novel that you could find in the mass-market stack in the Walmart sci-fi section.Very disappointing. Boring. Do not recommend."
1,Do Not Bother,"This is one of the worst books that I ever MADE myself read. That's right, I actually forced myself to complete this poorly written book. I kept waiting for the author to redeem himself, but alas I remained dissapointed. The really sad part is that the theme could be quite interesting. Unfortunately, the author creates a probable view of society after a holocast and does nothing with it.What was the deal with the mutunt soldiers? That was realistic (sarcasm). And of course the author couldn't give women too much credit by allowing them to be victorious in battle. Oh yes, the computer, stupid stupid stupid. If the scietists were able to get computers going again, do you really think that they would only repair hand-held children's games?This is a horrible book and a great waste of time. Unfortunately, Amazon has not given me the option of giving less than a one star review. The author owes my life a more than a few hours."
4,The Postman Delivers,"The Postman is a good, quick read, but about halfway through the plot and story start getting fuzzy as Brin uses the story to explore philosophical issues. I'm a big fan of post-nuclear fiction, and the book does not fully exploit Brin's interesting postnuclear view of the world. (the jack-of-all-trades and the master of none syndrome) The movie, on the other hand, does. It has a good, consistent, patriotic story and is everything the book should've been. (which doesn't happen very often) Still though, the book is quite good and I'd read it again if I had to do it over. I only wish the movie was longer and had more time exploring the postnuclear world as it did in the opening scene."
5,Post-apocalypse wow!,"I've read this twice and it affected me differently each time. For a book that is, ultimately, about hope and optimism and the capacity to rise above, this is an amazingly grim and downbeat novel. But if post-apocalyptic stories are your cup of meat--this is one of the best. It shares with Robert Edmond Alter's novel PATH TO SAVAGERY a strong capacity to make you feel the cold, the wet and the hunger; rather than glorify physical combat, both books convey the fear and desperation of a lawless, dog eat dog world. Kevin Costner's notorious film version isn't as awful as most people claim, but it doesn't manage to hold much interest after the first hour. There are a few things wrong with THE POSTMAN--namely the chief villains, who are a bit unbelievable, but that is just a quibble; David Brin has written an engrossing and thoughtful novel and its well worth seeking out."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Public service prevarication brings realistic results.An ordinary guy who comes up with a scam to get himself through in this nasty postapocalyptic world, after discovering some gear, ends up an important figure in starting to rebuild, and in a conflict. In a society like this it is no surprise that there will be a crazed religiously motivated and influenced ultra-right militaristic fascist group wanting to keep things how they are, and not allow information to again be widely communicated."
4,Pleasing,"This was an enjoyable book to read. This could actually happen to mankind. The book kept my attention throughtout, right up to the end."
4,Had to keep reading,"Be prepared for a slightly different ride to the movie. I purchased this after watching the movie and as usual there are differences, but enough similarities to not disappoint if you have seen the movie.I think, as a book, it captures a lot of the struggle of humanity with it's own self destructive tendencies. I found that I kept making excuses to read a bit more and a bit more. I will be interested to read other of David Brin's work and have high hopes that I have found another great author."
3,"Heartbreakingly poetic at times, but dated","At times, heartbreakingly poetic. Brin creates an interesting character and lets him evolve while staying true to the traits. Yet it felt very dated to me, especially the latter half of the book. I felt that Brin's choices with regard to plot were decisions made on the fly, rather than something planned in advance, and that bothered me. A good read, groundbreaking for its genre, but (can't believe I'm saying this) there were times when I wished it were closer to the movie plotline instead."
3,A great adventure.,"I had not seen the movie when I read this book, so the story was fresh for me. I was looking for a smaller story, I think, of the post apocalypse, but this was an exciting surprise. It is a great adventure and survival story. Good writing, good characters, but it may seem a bit sexist at times, so it should be taken into consideration the times in which this book was written. There was a breaking point for me though, at the ending. I'm not sure why the author made such a departure from the basic plot and tried to go sci-fi."
5,Highly recommended - deserves a miniseries not a movie,"This book has its limits in its origins so it may seem disjointed, but not an impossible read. It is classic science fiction because it gives new points of view and it makes you think. It even tried to explore how feminist ideas might survive the apocalypse and that such a society may not necessarily repeat mistakes of the past.If you are looking for a new book and haven't read this one buy it"
3,not great,"I got this book about 5 year ago, maybe a little longer. I've made several of the recipes, all were okay, none were terrible, but not a single one really worth making again. A lot of the others that I haven't made just don't inspire me. Look through the book before purchasing. I much prefer the Wilson Farm Country Cookbook and Janet Ballantyne's Joy of Gardening Cookbook. Several of the recipes in those books have become family favorites."
1,Phone doesn't matter if carrier's service is atrocious,"It doesn't matter how many bells and whistles come on a particular phone - it's only as good as the carrier. With Sprint, you will be headed for disappointment and frustration. Customer service, when you can actually get through to them, is incompetent. Prepare to have hours of your time stolen from you when you deal with a billing problem with Sprint. After switching credit cards, I've spent days trying to give them the new number to bill to, with no luck. I've had charges for services I never ordered nor authorized appear on my bill, and then spent literally hours of time e-mailing, trying to access their website and calling, with no resolution. Find a phone and a plan you can like with another carrier."
1,Call Waiting Disconnects Your Call,"There is one huge problem with this phone. When you're on a call and a second call comes in - the sound on your first call drops! Most people think that the first call was ended. Though it appears that way, the sound goes dead both ways on your first call.I am amazed that this has not been fixed and was not disclosed when I bought the phone. Search on Treo 700wx and call waiting in a search engine. You'll find a ton of complaints about the same bug.Palm - do some better testing - this is a basic feature!!!!"
2,too many duds,"Like a lot of people probably did, I ignored everyone I knew who told me that this phone has a lot of problems. Mine was no exception. I've had it for less than a year and have had every possible problem with it including multiple freezings, random screens that pop up hundreds of times/day, active sync not working, etc. The only thing I do love is the keyboard and ease of reading the screen. It is a bit bulkier than I would want also. As soon as I can find a well reviewed smartphone, I'm throwing this one in the trash!!"
1,Miserable is an understatement,"I had the Treo 300, 600 and 650, all Palm-based, and loved them all. The 700wx windows version is not ready for prime time. Crashes daily, synchs sporadically, calls people at random, cuts people off on hold, drains batteries .... I could go on and on and on. I absolutely detest this phone and wished I'd listened to the Sprint tech rep in the store who tried to warn me. How about that ... Sprint continues to cell an expensive, high-end phone that its own techs know is bad. The guy seemed to have a negative attitude in general, so I din't listen. I should have. Trust me, stick with the PALM version."
2,"Ok , but not great","The phone has a number of ""glitches"". I had it for 2 years with Sprint and needed to reset it (take off the back cover and push the reset button) weekly. It would constantly freeze. Synching became such a problem that I stopped doing it. My computer would randomly stop recognizing the phone and I would have to reinstall and often this created duplicate entries (contacts, calendar, etc). I used the phone as a modem, but that feature evently went awry as my computer stopped recognizing that too (Think it was a security software upgrade). I was happy to finally get rid of the phone and get hte new HTC Hero.ProsGood size for large handsColor touchscreenIt's a few years old now so the prices are down significantlyConsIts really behind the times relative to what android google os and other phones can do nowIt is a high maintanence phone"
1,Don't buy this,Bought it for Real Estate purposes. Not functional. Not practical. Just not good. Crashes constantly and email does not work well.
2,"Awesome phone, but Sprint is INTOLERABLE","Treo can do anything. Anything, period. There's nothing that I can't get, as long as I'm willing to pay through the nose to get it.Live TV, (Daily Show, et al.) Sirius Music, email, youtube, whatever you can imagine.BUT SPRINT IS TERRIBLETrue, they offer the Live TV and Sirius which I couldn't live without now that I'm spoiled.But do not call Sprint and expect to be sane afterwards. I can understand busy times and what not, but for the last couple months it seems as though they have cut their workforce in half and doing business with them is intolerable.INTOLERABLE"
4,Expanded usage,"I originally bought this phone because I wanted to combine my cell phone and my PDA, and it can use a 2GB SD card. I store a whole medical library on the storage card, and it is easily accessible, accesses files quickly. Sometimes the print runs off the side to the right without a way to get to it. Changing the size of the font sometimes works, but not always. The other PDA functions, such as contacts, calendar, etc., work great and synchronize easily. I also use Pocket Quicken, and it runs well, and syncs quickly with Quicken on the PC.Locking the keyboard when the phone is off is a must, and disabling the touchscreen is also necessary when talking on the phone. I also get better reception than my daughter, who has a new cell phone, using the same service (Sprint). Altogether, I'm sure I will buy another Treo when new ones come out."
2,MS Mobile is the Problem,"Bought this as an upgrade from the 650. It is actually a downgrade though, the software from Microsoft is horrible compared to the Palm, so the 700 with Palm might be better. When on the phone the software will 'go places', i.e. it will open up programs, when the messages or phone rings it will open the volume control, and will not close it."
1,Used book not in condition as described.,"The quality of this book was not as was advertised. I have bought many used books on line through Amazon and they have arrived in the condition that they were described and I have been completely satisfied. This book, through this dealer, was not. It was described as Very Good, but arrived in a VERY USED condition. I was completely dissatisfied and will never purchase from this dealer again."
4,Very good book for beginners,This book is very good. Its difficult to get lost unlike other books out there. It takes you step by step.
4,"Good, but twitchy","This is probably one of the better dance mix CD's out there, but I always find reason to question the choice of songs on these CDs. The remixes of ""Love Fool"" and ""How Bizarre"" are great but I question putting ""Da Dip"" in the middle of those. Many of these other tracks great but I don't like the ""Don't Speak"" remake."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this product based solely on reviews. When I tried it, the Eau de Toilette was even fainter than most others of its kind. It kind of smells like something you'd give a child. Not an appropriate perfume for a woman."
2,Not accepted by all cats,"It might be OK for small young cats who will eat about anything, but my large older cats ignored it after the first few bites, perhaps because the size, shape and texture of the individual bits is wrong for them. The bits are very small, hard, and have pointed tips, perhaps making them uncomfortable to chew. My adult cats go for the kinds of dry food that have much larger and rounder chunks."
5,Made a big difference,"I bought a full set of KYB MonoMax shocks KYB 565009 & 565006) for my 1999 F150 4X4 pickup (which already came with heavy duty shocks as OEM, but had 77k miles on them). These new shocks made a huge difference in handling and ride. The steering seemed much better as the roll is damped out and more controlled. I was not expecting this much improvement! Not too hard to install."
5,The Best Bionicle Game Ever,"I purchased this game for my son, who is 9, and he thinks it is great!! He likes that it has many Bionicle characters and it isn't boring."
1,Overpriced!,"This book is a classic and was a great original resource back in the 1960s. However, the material is extremely dated (from 1963) and the book lacks depth as it consists of a mere 84 pages -- it comes across more as an outline. Yet it lists today for an outrageous price of $95.95! One would do better acquiring a more recent (and comprehensive) book on research methodology that will include and update the information contained in Campbell and Stanley's book.Fred Rovai"
3,Decent,"UD bookstore didn't have it, so I had to order it here. Have opened the book though. Not knocking the book, just a bad buy for the UD HESC 326 class. Helps, but most of the stuff is common sense."
5,Do not miss it!!!,"This book is critical to students who study social scientific methods, especially experimental methods."
4,Very technincal,The books is good for whom has some knowledge in experimental design. The book not have examples is very theorical.
5,Sits on my desk,"The most important book on research designs to have, I use it weekly. It's brief, to the point, and 100% sound. I used it while in academics; now I find it particularly good for real-world (versus only laboratory) studies that need to be done quickly and on a budget. Though I've read it front to back, and have dog-earred lots of pages, it's value is that of a quick refresher and quick reference. A brief, inexpensive paperback."
1,Lousy sound,The sound from this device is almost unlistenable. Compact design is good. Cannot get very loud and distorts at higher volume levels. Better off with earphones.
1,"Horrible product, save your money","I was so excited at the idea of speakers that work with an MP3 player that's not an IPOD. But these speakers are a complete waste of money.They're horrible. You can barely hear the music over the static coming out of the speakers, regardless of the volume setting."
2,MP3 SPEAKERS,I LIKE THAT IT'S COMPACT AND THE SPEACKERS HAVE GOOD QUAILTY.IT COMES WITH IT'S OWN ADAPTER. THAT'S A PLUS.
2,worked for 2 days,Mine worked for 2 days then it quit working.I guess that what you get with China products.I'll be taking it apart to see if I can bring it back to life
3,Oldschool Quartet Singing,"Modern (that is, since about 1950) gospel fans be warned. This is the old school gospel quartet style of singing before the Golden Gate Quartet, Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers, and others jazzed things up and made syncopation and improvisation the name of the game. The version here of ""Precious Lord"" is the earliest known recorded version of this song. Not bad, but largely for historical interest. And since they're also from my hometown of Spartanburg, SC, I can't complain too much."
2,Not Scooby's Best Work,"This is not one of Scooby's better movies. Some of the images are fine, and there are some comical moments. The crime itself makes sense, and the actions of the criminals are interesting. But those are the only real good things I can say about this. Unlike ""Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost,"" or ""Scooby Doo On Zombie Island,"" the plot is quite thin. The misleads are not well placed; the actual criminals are a bit too obvious; and the presence of the real alien in my opinion does not really fit. Young children may like this, but unlike ""Scooby Doo and the Witch's ghost,"" or ""Scooby Doo On Zombie Island,"" this will probably have a young cut off age."
3,An fine family animation movie.,"The plot:Scooby Doo and his gang are going to road trip near in the desert. Scooby Doo and Shaggy believe that they saw a alien spaceship and then later. Then the both saw, them later as a test experences. Then a old man, believe he saw them too. Then one unknown young female and her dog, believe that is alien exist among us. Not terribly funny as the another Scooby Doo films or episodes, but worth viewing once. OK movie, at times, could have better. But i do like Scooby Doo and the Zombies is much better. DVD picture quality and sound is pretty good for a direct to video. Grade:B."
4,Another Triumph For Cartoondom's Greatest Dog Star,"Scooby Doo and the Alien Invaders is great fun for the whole family. Everyone returns(Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby) for this action-packed send up of Everything Alien, from Close Encounters to E.T. to Invasion of the Body Snatchers meets The X-Files. My nine-tear-old daughter particularly liked the part where Scooby pushes Shaggy around the Aliens' ship on a gurney. Funny action, good pacing and solid dialogue make this a sure-fire family treat. Don't miss it!"
4,Scooby Meets the X-Files,"The characters are the same, but their familiar clothes are updated slightly (Turtleneck on Velma is gone, Ascot on Freddy gone, Daphne is in shorts and a tank top, etc) The Mystery Machine is a close match and more importantly the voices are close to the originals.There are new songs and an updated version of the familiar theme song dune by Jennifer Love-Hewett. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE FAMILAR GENRE IS ALMOST THE SAME! Beware, however, as ""the hormones"" are almost on overdrive, and curve hugging outfits are a bit overdone. There is a cute love song & animation sequence. The program is safe for kids, but not as innocent as the originals. The title mentions aliens and delivers. It almost looked like the writers had worked for the ""X-Files"" as there were plenty of similarities. There were several advertisements for Cartoon Network show-themed videos and a short non-Scooby film afterwards. The video lasted 73 mins."
3,"Scooby Doo is OK too, with all aliens not dressed in Blue","""Scooby-Doo and the alien invaders"" is a funny movie except the weird looking aliens, so I give this 3 stars or *** (3 out of 5)."
4,"Pretty cool, great story line, a little too predictable.....","My son loves anything with Scooby Doo on it, weather it be a knapsack or a toy, he loves it. This was a great movie and he enjoyed it tremendously, however, havign to sometimes watch it with him, I found this a little on the predictable side. A little annoying at times also. But, hey, it makes my son proud so I will keep it...."
3,The One Where Shaggy Falls in Love,"Out of all the new Scooby Doo movies (Zombie Island, Witch's Ghost), I found this one for be more like the original tv series-- thin plot and not much character development. As in the later Scooby and Shaggy shows, the ""rest of the gang"" (Fred, Daphne and Velma) are minimal characters. But the new twist of Shaggy and Scooby falling in love with groovy chicks is fun and sweet, and makes it a worthwhilw flick for Scooby fans. Kids will enjoy."
2,Not comprehensive,"Although I haven't taken the board yet, I think this book is not sufficient to study for the board. Topics that discussed are very detailed but left many important topics. There is too much un-necessary details, good for beginners like medical students but not a review for the board."
4,not very helpful for board review,"I bought this book for board review. Did not find it very helpful at all...not very comprehensive but it seems to be an easy read. In all fairness, because I did not find it useful for boards I did not read most of it. For boards, I recommend Laughing Your Way and PedStudy."
2,Bit disappointed!,"It wasn't the book I thought it was! For those having the specific focus of the book it might be of benefit but to me looking for somewhat broader principled guide to the ""art"" of language learning tips etc, it is quite useless! "" Right church,wrong pew"", I guess would characterize it for me!"
1,BEWARE - ITEM NOT MALIBU 2000,"The items shipped were not Malibu-2000 as stated and indicated on the invoice. Items were ""Malibu"" an entirely different and arguably inferior product."
5,Love this stuff!,"Smells good, works great- I swim 2-3x/wk and its perfect- great as a body wash too! I've been using this for about 15 years- I've tried multiple other chlorine shampoos and I always come back to this one!"
5,Great Shampoo,My kids are competitive swimmers. If it wasn't for this product their hair would be like straw. It my daughter's favorite brand of all that she has tried.
1,Truth lives,"Listen to the four-part interview with April Oliver on ""Black Op Radio""(#419) and decide for yourself whether TAILWIND and the CNN report ""Valley of Death"" are bogus. You will be convinced that Oliver spoke truth to power and suffered the consequences for it."
1,Not strong enough to support.,"These plant supports were not strong enough to support my plant, they just bent over with the plant."
3,A nice book,"This book is too nice.it presents the lifestyle of Emerson,the great philosopher in a very analytical way."
5,John Wayne Century DVD Collection,I bought this for my husband's birthday and we've watched John Wayne every night for 3 weeks! There was only one movie we didn't like (The High and the MIghty) and the rest we really enjoyed.
3,Disappointing DVDs,"This is a great collection of films by one of the greatest actors to ever grace the silver screen. Too bad he didn't get the recognition that he deserved. He only won one Oscar and that for his last film, ""The Shootist"". He really should have received more for such films as ""The High and the Mighty"", ""The Quiet Man"", ""The Cowboys"", and others. The films themselves are great. I only gave this collection a 3 due to the poor quality of the DVDs themselves. The sound was remastered for each of the films but no longer is synchronized with the film. In most cases, the sound comes before the action. This is very disconcerting while viewing the film. If not for this, this collection of John Wayne films would have received a 5. Too bad more care wasn't taken in remastering the sound."
5,TRUE AMERICAN,"JOHN WAYNE is what all us AMERICANS THINK and would like to be, these films, despick the lives and way we all wish we were. I WATCH THESE MOVIES WHEN I get discouraged with the way some of our leaders conduct themselves. RESTORES my faith in the COWBOY-AMERICAN WAY."
3,John Wayne Century Collection,Most of the discs played well in both a computer drive or in one of 3 dvd players. However two of the discs would not completely play in any drive. My thanks to Amazon for promptly replacing the defective merchandise.The movies themselves are of course: John Wayne. Nothing else to be said. The second set seems to be OK
5,Twists and turns in a fast action space opera,Fantastic read!The plot keeps you guessing and just when you think you know where it's headed you're proved dead wrong with a shocking about-face.Great characters and clever plotting make this a book to remember.I think it's good enough to rival Star Wars and I can't think of higher praise than that.Hope there's a part 3 soon!
4,Schleich Zebra calf,"This little male zebra calf is very nice. However, he's not quite as nice as the other zebra calf (head turns a little to right instead of left, female). The other one's mane has ridges, and the painting job is a bit more realistic. Still, its a very nice toy."
2,"good , biased so take it with a grain of salt.","i will save you the trouble of buying this, he says that your one child, in the midst of all vaccinated children, doesnt need shots. but i dont think he is 100% accurate, and i eventually decided on a very delayed schedule for school entrance reasons. i dont want to risk my kids getting measles, because i will never know the vax status of everyone around them or what they have been exposed to. i dont like when a source is 100% pro or against vaccination, because neither side is right. so, this is somewhat too one sided for me."
4,Very interesting book about meditation...,"This is the second of three books I have read by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan on the topic of meditation. The one I read prior to reading this was Jewish Meditation. The one I read after was Meditation and the Kabbalah (please see my reviews of both books). This book speaks about the possible meditative experiences or practices by figures in the Hebrew Bible, such as Ezekiel, for example. This book was harder to grasp and less practical than the book Jewish Meditation, but easier to grasp and more practical than Meditation and the Kabbalah. I suggest, read Jewish Meditation by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan first, then move on to this if you want.I give this four out of five stars, for a very well-researched and thought provoking book, which is also a bit too hard to grasp without some background knowledge."
5,Meditation and the Bible,This is one that I take often with me in travel it is well worn and well read one of my favorites.
1,where is it,"still waiting for it , has not arrived yesterday , so when ? I need it for a christmas rpesent"
2,An Uninspiring Story,"""The Deep"" follows Samantha Montgomery, who had spent many summers with her friends at Lake Vintage. Then, during one ""fateful summer,"" something evil is discovered at Lake Vintage.At first glance, the storyline, although unoriginal, is guiltily pleasing, as evidenced by the success of such stories as ""I know what you did last summer"" and ""Scream."" But Ms. Fox would do the story much more justice if her writing did not detract so forcefully from it. Her ineptitude in descriptions, conversations, and pacing are sorely evident. By the end of 219 pages, I was ready to drown myself in the nearest lake.I gave this novel two stars instead of one because I feel that with more time and effort, Ms. Fox could make this story a lot better. The novel itself seems rushed, as if she was trying to rush it to the presses. The result is regrettable."
2,Disappointed,"I own the Vornado 530 model, the smaller brother to this fan. The 630 doesn't move any appreciably more air (turns out just 17% more based on Cubic-Feet-per-Minute specs (CFM), just a broader column of air that is harder to focus. The 530 moves it's colum of air 60 feet, the 630 just 70 feet, ie not much more.I returned this fan. I am going to buy the 660 model, which is more $$, but moves more than twice the air of the 530 and is only slightly larger than the 630.So, Don't waste your money, either buy the 530, or step up to the 660."
5,Quite pleased,"I bought this fan hoping that I wouldn't have to have 3 or 4 sitting around my room aiming all directions (I'm a very hot-natured person) like I previously had. One aiming at my computer chair.. One aiming at my lounge chair.. One aiming at my bed.. And it really does the job. I have an average sized room and on medium it runs quite quietly (although you CAN hear it, I'm just a little hard of hearing so it doesn't bother me) and circulates air all over the room. It kind of feels like you're in a gazebo outside on a day with a nice cool breeze. Unless you're standing right in front of it, you'll get even-temperatured air coming from all directions. It's a little pricey, but given it's amazing performance I'd say it's worth it so far. Just hope it holds up and lasts for some years."
3,"Quiet, but moves less air than expected","I bought my Vornado 630B 3-speed fan about a year ago. It is a very quiet, seemingly well built fan. However, for the money, I was not overly impressed with the volume of air that it moves. It moves no more air than you would expect from even the cheapest of fans (but does so very quietly). So, if you want it for its quietness, 5-stars... for volume of air, I would buy a cheap fan."
4,"Great to circulate air, and for personal use.","It is great for circulating air and keeping a room from feeling stuffy. In addition it is realtively quiet (except for the high setting). However, compared to some of the larger diameter fans you don't feel a lot of ""volume"" being moved around. The fan definitely works as advertised and is a perfect circulator, but if you want to feel like a 'wall of air' is being pushed around, look elsewhere."
3,Small but So-So,"I purchased two of these to supplement circumventing the use of my A/C this summer, but they're not as powerful as I expected, with all of their hype and advertising. They're small, high-tech looking, and do somewhat circulate the air, but in a Southeast Texas pre-summer season, I don't think that these Vornados are going to be much of a lifesaver. One of them is now dedicated strictly for keeping my PS3 cooler, and the other just gets moved around to help out some bigger fans..."
2,publicity is hot air,doesn't do what all the hype and hoopla says it does. no better than any other fan i've bought. has no remote and that means bending down to find knob.
1,Lots of hype and not Much air flow,"I purchased one of these several months ago to replace an aging and abused 10 year old Lasko 3530 whirlwind when I found them no longer available. I figured for $60 dollars it must really be good. Well, I was wrong and was very disappointed with it's performance. Though it is indeed quiet it is also severely anemic when it comes to moving air. I am pleased to find out that my preferred fan is now being marketed under the name Air King 9530. My Varnado will be going to the garage sale or kicked to the curb. If you want a fan that is quiet but actually moves 700 cfm of air buy the Air King 9530 for half the price."
1,MADE IN CHINA - DO NOT BUY.,"If it is made in China, why is it a 60-dollar fan?? I never even opened the box and sent it right back. Spend the extra $12 for the US-Made Vornado 733, which has a limited lifetime warranty, not a 5-year warranty. Its footprint is a little larger but it works amazingly."
1,"Total Junk, avoid at all costs","This fan claims it can push air 70 feet. WRONG! Not possible to feel the air 10 feet from this fan. I have a $19.95 free-standing fan from Sears that pushes more air than this piece of junk. I don't know why all these people are giving it ""rave reviews"". Maybe all these positives reviews are Vornado stock holders. :)"
2,Not like they used to make 'em,"In 2001 (or thereabouts) I bought 3 Vornado fans because I loved them so much. I'm very sensitive to noise and can't stand the sound of a motor! The Vornados I bought are smallish, maybe 10 inches diameter, and the head raises and lowers. BUT the really good thing about this fan is that it had NOT 3 distinct speeds but a knob that let you go by minute gradations from fullest force to least, like the volume knob on an old radio. At the least force, the fan is TRULY ""whisper quiet"" (how many fans advertize this way but turn out to be huge disappointments?). Anyway, last year I wanted to buy another, and lo and behold, they don't make them this way anymore. I bought one anyway, even though it only had a 3-speed (click-click-click) knob, and at the lowest speed it's quite noisy. And though I'm not entirely sure that this model, the Vornado 630B, is the one I tried, I think it is, and it's noisy. Upshot: I don't think there IS a quiet fan made by anyone anywhere anymore."
4,Works great!,"Tried to get by with a less expensive model, but it just didn't do the job. We are HOT in this part of Texas in August, and this little model helps the A/C cool us down. This is the 2nd one of this model I've purchased, and they both run constantly. Would definitely recommend, and would purchase again."
3,Nothing special,"I just returned this fan to Home Depot. No specific complaints (except it was a bit stinky, but I would expect it from a new plastic device). I just did not see how I could justify its price. I have a $25 fan that does the same thing - moves the air around, and actually more efficiently as it's a larger fan."
2,Failed completely after less than 4 months,"Yesterday, I turned the fan on, heard a *pop*, and it died. No response on any of the 3 speed settings. Now I have to ship it back to Kansas for warranty service, though I expect it to cost about $25 in shipping charges (both ways) to get it fixed. I'm pretty disappointed..."
2,"Great when they are new, but...","Hey no doubt about it... when these things are new, they absolutely move air better than anything around. But... (you knew one was coming, didn't you) they are not built to last. Over time, their maximum speed just gets slower and slower. Eventually they just give out (very true of the small and midsize units, much less so for the larger ones). So while I'm a fan of the Vornado fans, I cannot recommend them without reservation. If money is no object, by all means go ahead. Just know that in 3-4 years, you WILL be replacing it (or putting in the pile to Goodwill). If you're on a budget, I'd say you need to look elsewhere. Fans should last 10 years minimum in my book. These don't. Wish things were different."
2,Just ok,This fan is just OK. Not as great as other reviews mentioned. A box fan works just as well. Not at all quiet. Have to turn the volume way up if watching tv.
5,My Third Vornado Because It's Better Than the Rest,"I was in a retail store recently and the store had hundreds of turned-on fans in the fan section. Some of the fans were on full-blast and I barely felt a breeze. Not the Vornado, which was roughly ten dollars more than its competition. More focused breeze gust, less noise, more power, the Vornado is worth the extra ten dollars or so. Now I've got a tiny Vornado in the kitchen and two 630B Mid Sizes, one in my office, one in the bedroom."
4,Great little Fan,"I enjoy this fan as an individual fan, it cannot compensate for more than one person or one small space. Much better with circulating A/C air. Ordered this one and received it, however when I attempt to purchase an additional one they are now unable to ship to the US Virgin Islands. I am certain if I was shipping it to Puerto Rico they would ship."
3,Doesn't seem that much better than less expensive fans.,"I did a side by side comparison between this ""Air Circulator"" and a much less expensive, generic, fan of similar size. I don't think the Vornado Air Circulator lives up to the hype about it. At high speed the circulator does move a lot of air, but it also makes a lot of noise. It is definitely not ""quiet"" as Vornado claims. At low speed, I can't see that it is any big improvement over a ordinary, generic fan."
2,Not the quality I expected,"Having owned Vornado fans in the past, I ordered 2 of these and was expecting a level of quality from past experience. Long story short, one of the fans died within 6 months. The other is fine, but comparing my really old version to the newer ones shows a decrease in build quality.I'm switching to other brands to see what's available. I can't trust the Vornado name any longer."
4,hum + whisper quiet = hum,"Since I sleep with a fan on, I bought the 630 due to the advertised ""whisper quiet"" claim as well as mostly very good reviews. To be reasonable and fair, my expectations for this level of quiet is on the low setting only, thats all I want.I'm really disappointed, there is a distinct low frequency hum thats audible over the air flow. I see a few other complaints about that as well, if these fans are NOW manufactured to where they all have this hum, I have to cry foul on the whisper quiet claim. The other thing is, I have a fowl burnt electrical smell that is still very noticeable after 2 days running.UPDATE:After breaking the fan in, I rate it much higher. (origianly 2 stars)It curculates a good amount of air and if you have iton a solid base, it cuts down on any noises the fan may emit."
4,Decent little fan,Nice little fan. More for 1 person or a smaller room. Pretty quiet. Does circulate the air but I wanted something to really move the air. For that purpose I ended up with a Lasko blower fan. They really move the air with about the same footprint. Noisier than the Vornado though.
2,Not that silent,"This fan isn't as silent in operetion as I used to think of Vornado. By the way, they are not made exclusively in USA anymore they do them in China now. It is not quite even on slowest speed. Vornado good humidifiers, as for fans I am not sure right now."
2,Not a quiet fan,"We purchased this fan because we were under the impression it is quieter than other fans. For the money, it is not much higher quality or quieter than a $20 fan. If you are looking for quiet, try another fan. This one will disapoint."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and reading reviews. One big disappointment for me is the noise - just ok on low and much too loud on the other two higher speeds. Also, I did not find this to live up to its claims of moving air throughout a room. I intend on returning it and for now will be sticking with my 20 plus year old Panasonic F-1205 - truly quiet."
3,Not as quiet as I hoped,"I wanted a fan that would circulate air slowly and quietly without drafts, just enough to mix cool air at the floor and warm air at the ceiling. This fan, while a good product generally, doesn't have a low enough speed to do this. It was too noisy and created a noticable draft even at the lowest setting."
1,Only useful idiots will buy this,"Clinton should scare all freedom loving Americans with this ghostwritten [garbage]. This is pure communism unmasked. She subtly suggests the state would do a better job raising our children than we could. Sounds a little Marxist to me. Take a close look at Chelsea. She is obviously Web Hubbell's child. Would Ms. Clinton have us believe we should have each other's love children and then raise them collectively? As Stalin liked to say, ""only useful idiots will buy this""."
1,Disappointed,"The book in its introduction describes how family life used to be.Its primary focus is the need for ""investment"" to end great social ills such as poverty, homelessness, and illegitamacy. While well intentioned this ignores the failure of government intervention to solve these problems. In the almost 40 years since the New Frontier was first proposed we have seen only limited results, from increased ""investment"" (taxes). That increased tax dollars have marginally narrowed poverty, abuse, and neglect found within inner cities.Government funded good intentions are often the greatest enemy to the same people Ms. Clinton is trying to protect. Often leading many to be unable to escape griding poverty, illegitamacy, and abuse she is trying to protect.The focus should be on greater self reliance, rather than on creating a whole new generation of children who are unable to escape the stranglehold of increasingly repressive Orwellian system."
1,an absurd book,"Hillary Clinton's ostensible support for children as posed by this book is utterly grotesque in the light of her support for many causes detrimental to the welfare of children.[...] her inability to tell the truth except when it serves her own ends is stamped over everything she touches. What village was Hillary in when 900,000 men, women and children--particularly the children of Rwanda were butchered while Bill Clinton was president? Don't waste your time on this book."
1,Family is Foundation of Society,"This book is absolutely scary. It's a look into the mind of a devout Socialist. For thousands (millions) of years, the family has been the foundation of society. In just a few decades, our government (village) has nearly destroyed the family through heavy taxation and social-engineering. The only salvation Clinton sees is that same government (village)."
1,Absolutely Amazing!,"The book gives lip service at the very begining as to how a child's parents are the obvious primary care givers and providers for a child, but the rest of the book is in direct contradiction with this common sense view. In short, a good deal of Hillary's ""village"" is none other than the federal government and its myriad of programs. There isn't a government program she's come across that she doesn't like. Well, I suppose that Mrs. Clinton, as member of a wonderfully successful nuclear family, would be just the right person to be the architect for the ways in which the federal government can rear its big ugly head into the parent-child relationship."
1,"Written by Barbara Feinman Todd, not Hillary Clinton","Hillary was apparently ""too busy"" to do much on this book at all. It was written for her by Barbara Feinmann Todd. There was an agreement that Todd would share the credit when the book was published. As you can all see, there is no acknowledgement whatsoever of her work. This fact, ALONE, makes the book not worthy of attention.However, even if Ms. Clinton HAD, as promised, given co-credit to Ms. Todd, the book is a socialist's dream - ""It Takes a Village"" means ""You can't be trusted to make decisions about how to raise your child - the government has to make the decisions for you"". This is typical of the liberal double-speak; they call things that are terrible by nice, warm-n-fuzzy names. Socialism is a terrible thing. Period. Ms. Clinton embraces it. That truly tells me all I need to know about her."
2,Check your facts,"Some interesting content in the book, but I'm shocked that the tenth anniversry edition still contains a quote in the introduction that is not only paraphrased, but attributed to the wrong author. Did no one fact check this book? Did no editor notice the error in ten years? The quote should be ""Ye cannot live for yourselves; a thousand fibers connect you with your fellow-men, and along those fibers, as along sympathetic threads, run your actions as causes, and return to you as effects"" and the author is English cleric Henry Melvill, NOT American author Herman Mellville."
4,A look into the 20th century socialist mind,"The Manifesto, updated for the 20th century. Well-meaning, but Mrs. Clinton obviously would like the federal government to be involved in every facet of our lives without any regard to where the money comes from. A must-read for capitalists who are tired of big government and high taxes."
2,Disappointing -- I expected better,"I didn't actually read every page of Hillary Clinton's book, but I read the first half and the majority of the second, and I can tell you--- don't bother. There was one chapter near the end, ""Every Business is a Family Business"" that I thought was pretty good, but for the most part I was completely uninspired. Its a hodge podge, anecdotes from her own life, pats on the back for little good things that people are doing, nostalgia for old values, pointing out all the evils and dangers in the world, lots of religious references. There wasn't that much I didn't agree with, but it was all obvious stuff, and if it wasn't someone of Hillary Clinton's stature writing it, it wouldn't have held my interest.All in all, a disappointment. I was hoping at least for some amusement."
4,An easy read insightful book for the 90's and beyond,"Mrs. Clinton provides insightful and alluring ideas about children growing up in the 1990's and beyond. Some sound, sensical information without putting you through the ringer of philisophical thought on childrearing! Only a mom could have written it"
1,It Takes a Village - Good Reason Why Hillary Must Be Neutralized!,"A book that illustrates why Hillary Clinton must be stopped at all costs! Remember the following path to totalitarianism: Dependency (the ""Village"" concept) => Central Planning => Socialism => Communism => Fascism. Hillary would destroy freedom for everyone! She is the devil reincarnated and all freedom loving people should seek to destroy her brand of politics and the ideas she is attempting to promulgate with this book!"
1,Read between the lines,Hillary Clinton's political manifesto. It sings the praises of Socialism and multiculturalism.
4,SO INSPIRING!!!,"This is such a touching,thoughtful book written by such a sincere woman. She has done so much for our country and our children.I have three children and I know how difficult it is to raise them on my own. I need help from my neighbors,friends,and the entire community I live in. I am so stressed out trying to satisfy my needs as well as my children. Nobody knows this subject better than Hillary who is such a devoted mother who spends so much quality time with her daughter.They spend greatholidays together twice a year.I am so glad we have such a sincere role model like Hillary to tell us how to raise our children because I for one need help.I have a life too."
1,"""It Takes an Elitest to Raise Chickens""","Is there anyone who truly believes that Hillary really cares about children, or that she has the slightest idea of what it takes to raise a family? From her lofty perch, she sees people as chickens who need to be managed, feed, medicated, and controlled in order to maximize production and to make things run smoothly for the benefit of those in charge of the coop. Like so many of the professional ""do-gooders"" of our day, she gets her ideas from a warped top-down view of life. The most dispicable element of our society are those who prey upon children and use them for their own gratification. A close second to this are those who hide behind children to further their own careers and political agendas."
1,Socialism is alive and well in Clintonville,"What a total advocate for socialism! Hillary will always push for total Government control of all Americans from the cradle to the grave. She makes it very clear in this book that she expects the Government to do what is best for all citizens, and the ultimate product will be all citizens fitting into the same mold of admiration for her as President. I believe she sees her self as a benevolent dictator."
3,Decent General Information on Wide Variety of Issues,"I review this trying to ignore that it is partisan. I found the personal stories about raising a daughter did not get overly emotional but were still endearing. Most of the book wrote intelligently and cursorily over a variety of issues such as child care, early education programs, and the modern family condition. This book did not try to teach me anything new, but rather synthesize many things I already knew. That made it light reading. I'm not sure who the audience would be if I ignore the partisan aspects. Perhaps by ignoring the politics I have just removed the purpose of this book?"
3,"5 Please tell me where your heart is, Ms. Clinton","As I explicitly state in all my political book reviews, I am a political moderate and social conservative. Another important consideration regarding my view of Ms. Clinton: it has been terribly difficulty for me to forgive her ""I don't sit home and bake cookies"" comment from the early `90s. As many people know, being a full time parent is a noble profession, and I personally believe it significantly more difficult than most sit in a cube jobs, including my own, which I am responsible for five employees and an $800,000 budget. That said, amazingly enough, I agree with 80% of Ms. Clinton's ideas. I just wonder why she does not come out and talk about her religious convictions. She is so fluffy on the topic, which makes me believe she only talks about it for political gain. I will probably be lambasted with some ""separation of church and state"" gibberish, but this is my opinion and I am sticking to it."
5,It DOES take a village,"Anyone who has raised a child knows that one or two people alone do not and cannot do the job completely. Our neighbors, our church, our schools, our friends, grandparents, sometimes total strangers all have an influence on us and our children. We no longer have the luxury of living in homes with extended families, as families in other countries do. I don't know how anyone can imagine that Mrs. Clinton is arguing for government intrusion in the way we raise our kids. If seeing that our schools are the best or our health care is the best then I guess you're right. We do not rely only on parents to raise children, we rely on store owners to see that our kids don't buy things that are not appropriate, we rely on movie theatre managers not to admit kids to R rated movies, we rely on teachers to teach our kids the 3Rs--in other words, the community. A parent's job is to teach kids values and to love them."
4,still love to eat it and never tired to eat it,It s good soup and delicous . I 'll buy it again and again...
2,Very weak induction,This has a very weak induction dosnt get you hypnotised. In one of his other cds he talks about the 4th demension as being your spirit even though the 4th demension is time and everyone knows that except for steve g jones apperently so it just makes you mad.
3,"Not everything I was hoping for, but not ruling it out yet","I purchased this awhile ago, and having used it several times, I've decided that it isn't the ""miracle"" I was looking for, but it was very relaxing, putting me to sleep easily and soundly, and allowing me to meditate easier. Not sure yet if the hynosis part is working, but I'm still using it so I guess we'll see. Either way, you can't lose for only $.99, right?"
5,Steve G. Jones is simply the best,"I first learned about Steve G. Jones through a professor I had a couple of years ago. Since then I have been an avid follower of his work. If you would like to learn more about Steve G. Jones and his work, you may look him up on [...]. He has ""moved the free line"" as Eben Pagan talks about and gives you a massive amount of value there for free. So if you are skeptical, as I was, feel free to check him out there first. Steve G. Jones will not disappoint you."
4,Not a magical solution.,"Keep your expectations realistic. Hypnosis isn't going to magically melt away the pounds while you sit on the couch eating chips and watching TV. But it can help you with the mental challenge of changing the unhealthy habits and attitudes that keep you overweight.Production quality of the recording is very good and the customer service is quick to respond to any questions you may have. Overall I've had good results. Nothing amazing, but I've made many small improvements that I can build on."
2,Didn't work for me,Didn't work for me. I listened every night for over a month. I even tried to listen a couple of times each night but no....didn't do a thing for me.
2,"This tape is OK, but some of them are a waste","Thought Steve G Jones was a pretty good hypnotherapist, but visited his website and I see that he has hypnosis tapes for penis and breast enlargement, which is of course ridiculous. I guess if folks think they are bigger, then they are? Hypnosis cannot increase organ size. That's nonsense. So I'm not sure it is wise to purchase hypno tapes from someone who would participate in disreputable types of tapes. Just my thoughts."
3,"OK, but didn't go the whole way.....","I know got better sleep and it did help with some of my sensless eating habits, but I still was eating too much. I guess I was hoping for a quick fix, but should know better by now. I did not listen for 21 days straight, as suggested and will try again. Hope others have better luck."
4,Very relaxing - helped me sleep,"I have only listened to this one time and fell asleep before the end of the ""suggestions"". The speakers voice is ok, which tends to be a big issue with me with audio books. I am middle aged and have occasional insomnia (as well as battle of the bulge). If this audio does nothing more than help me get a better night's sleep, it will probably help me lose weight (but i""m hoping to be reprogrammed about food too)."
2,Not Effective in my experience.,"Twenty years ago I used a Hypnosis tape that helped me lose over 40 pounds. I couldn't find the tape after years in storage and moving a couple of times. I decided to try this one. Not impressed, it was difficult to connect with the hypnotist because of a couple of reasons. I've heard other people mention someone's voice being annoying or not soothing. I found a little bit of that mix in this case. I also felt it took way to long to get to the deep relaxation area compared to the original excellent system I had used. In the end after faithfully using this program for 30-45 days, I may have lost 5 lbs, and who's to say that wasn't my own doing anyways. I know Hypnosis can work, this particular program didn't work for me. Maybe someone else will have success, but my advice would be to keep looking."
5,"When it comes to hypnosis products, Steve is the man!","I stopped counting long ago, but I own well over 300 of Steve's CDs anddownloads. I've been using his products for well over a year and I've gotten excellent results with them. I've been using hypnosis for over 36 years and I own over 1,000 hypnosis CDs, MP3s, and cassettes, but I've gotten greater results over the past year, using his products, than I've gotten in many years before. I even had a phone session with Steve and it was wonderful! Yeah, when it comes to doing hypnosis, Steve is definitely the man! Don't bother looking elsewhere!Review by Angelo B., Kew Gardens, New York."
1,Creepy Voice and Music,"So, I hate to be so critical... but the music, along with the echoey voice, along with him not introducing himself at all, equals him creeping me the hell out. I started to listen while going to sleep, but I got scared every time he told me to do something. When he says things like ""that's right"" slowly and deeply in the middle of telling me to ""bend over and pick up a conch shell"", I'm sorry, I just had to turn it off. At least it was 99 cents."
4,I am a believer...WOW....,"ok... For anyone with doubts.... i say go for it. I bought it a few weeks ago and started listening to it along with my other meditation stuff... I have weight to lose and I really stopped eating health. I noticed yesterday that I really been shopping healthier..A LOT HEALTHIER!!! My eating is still slow to turn, but I am eating healthier each day without even noticing. I haven't ate fruits in 3 months...now, I eat fruits just because. I think it is working. Still up to me, but it has gotten a whole lot easier to walk pass the cookie isle."
3,Power Your Mind to Achieve Weight Loss,"It's been 3 weeks since I've been listening to this CD at night. I will say it is very relaxing and I don't get very far into it before I fall into a restful sleep. I have noticed that I don't snack as much, but as for weight loss I haven't seen anything yet, but I'm hopeful."
2,Not worth it for me,"I stuck to the Rice and Chicken and GAINED weight. Eating the same things everyday gets old really fast. Plus, I was CONSTANTLY hungry."
2,R.kelly Lite,"Trey Songz has a Good voice. He is very Influenced by R.kelly as are alot of artists over the past decade. Trey like any Newbie has His Influences all over His Musical Sleeves. the Music&Production here is a Dime a Dozen.good to see Aretha Franklin lending a Hand. it will be interesting to see where His career goes. right now He is R.kelly Lite.we shall see if he ever reaches half the heights that R.kelly has.the good thing with a debut is that you can grow as a Writer,Vocalist&Performer. time will tell."
2,Hmm...,"I bought this album when it first came out. There was all this hype surrounding him that he was the future of R&B. Well... I was rather unimpressed by this CD and stored it away after one listen. There's nothing new here. Songs about love making, blah, blah, blah. There's even a song about a girl's... behind, cleverly titled ""Ur Behind."" (Me being the innocent person I am, I actually thought that it was going to be about something different, like someone being behind in a relationship. You know, something with substance. Silly me.) His vocals are nothing special and aren't distinctive. The songs are bland. This is the same stereotypical male R&B that the music industry have been feeding us since the early 90s. An R. Kelly clone. If I may suggest someone, Anthony Hamilton is the way to go if you want something soulful and great. Skip this."
4,Good Album,"Trey Songz's ""I Gotta Make It"" is an album of good standard songs and it really portrays his musical talents. However, there are a couple of songs that I felt he could have done without. Overall I would give the album on a scale from 1-10, a strong 8 due to the fact that the album is good album to clean up to. I would have to say that the ""I Gotta Make It (Remix)"" featuring Aretha Franklin is one of the hottest songs on the album. I like how he tweaks the original lyrics to make it fit the beat of the remix. I think that Trey Songz is a very talented artist and he can really have longeveity, if he sticks to making good quality music."
3,Good....,"I anxiously awaited to Trey's debut CD, after hearing samples here and there I was became very excited. Trey has a wonderful voice, and that was evident on this CD, i just though that his lyrics and song selections were horrible and did not truly showcase his talent. They are good songs, I just expected something more. All in all a good CD, not the best but not the worst. Listen beofore you buy."
3,interesting debut,"Trey Songz debut album got me interested because of his pretty good single, JUST GOTTA MAKE IT. i was quite impressed with his show of refinement and his ""at ease"" attitude towards his music. he sounds comfortable and does not need to use profanity or extremely explicit lyrics to have someone like me head bopping to his cuts.My favs were KINDA LOVIN. YOU NEVER KNOW, FROM A WOMAN'S HAND....I liked the message he was tryn to relay in CHEAT ON YOU but something just wasn't right. He shouldn't have to cheat, letting her know how he feels is good enough.Loved the album. gave it 3 stars cos i think he his lyrics could be better. Can't wait for album # 2!"
3,Well......,"Beautiful voice...body as well...lips...can go on... could have been a better album though. He sounds like R Kelly on some songs, Carl Thomas on others. Fav tracks are Gotta Go, Cheat on You, Ooh, UR Behind, Just Wanna Cut (and interlude) In the Middle..."
4,Impressive!!!!,"His whole CD is really good. I feel the CD isn't just for the young crowd, it's for everyone to listen to. He is very talented. I don't know what it is about those from VA,(Chris Brown,Missy)they some talented people."
3,Eh,"It was OK, but he needs to come stronger with the second CD. I get it, he can sing, but I need lyrics too. He has a great song with Twista that should have been included, so that disapointed (sp?) me. I liked Cheat on You...been there. It was a good white noise CD, but not something I see myself listening to over and over."
3,Just Gotta Make It Better,"Decent album, nothing spectaculaur. Pretty much like everything that has been released recently. I like the songs ""Gotta Make It"", ""Ur Behind"", and maybe a couple of others. Some ok beats at times and then some songs are just obvious in the way they were written that he was really just trying to rhyme some words together. There could be more indepth issues talked about on this album and better song writing. I'm personally not telling anyone to go buy this album, but it is ok."
2,The Hype is called Clive Davis,"This is the first time that I wanted to slap Aretha Franklin. Now she know this boy can't sing! I don't blame it all on her because I know who was behind this. The one and only Clive Davis is now greedy! It is not the music with him anymore. I'm disappointed and I want my money back! I did enjoy hearing Aretha Franklin and the song ""A Womans Hand"" was pretty good, I did not expect the whole CD to sound like a sick puppy dog. I thought he was going to bring a little soul into the music something like Howard Hewitt."
5,In my opinion he has made it.,I really like this album.It doesn't try to be all perfact and top notch. but Trey smoothes you into his voice and style and this album may have to grow on some but once it does you will see all the potential this new artist has. And hopefully he will be making music for many years to come. I think it's about time for some new musical talent and Trey Songz is just what the Doctor order!
3,"Good quality, but redundant","The quality of the art in this collection is great, however the majority of the items are animal based. There are few plain geometric patterns and nothing usable as borders, etc. There is another Dover collection that specifically includes Celtic borders. Most of Dover's collections give you a fairly wide selection, but this one is stuck on a theme and is also a bit thin. Only 96 designs! If you are looking for animal motifs in your Celtic clipart, this is the collection for you! If you are looking for anything else, look elsewhere."
3,Not a complete history,"For Rampage die hard fans, this purchase will be a no brainer...However, if you're looking for a complete history of Rampage I would suggest you steer clear of purchasing this item. While it does show some of his greatest victories, it shows NONE of his defeats. Missing are his first two battles with Wanderlei, Rua, and his loss to Griffin. Great matches, but not matches that he would like to remember since he lost...fair enough, but I would rather spend my money on something with a more complete history of the man then this.Quality - his latest UFC fights look great, while obviously his earlier fights in Pride aren't as high video quality"
5,Love it,"Very good for small things. Can handle 2-4 KC Strips and 4-6 medium hamburgers. If your cooking for a larger crowd, you should look for something bigger."
2,Black stuff on grates,"I was looking for an old style cast iron Hibachi, like from the 70's. Saw this one and decided to try it. Came quickly, no damage. Assembly was easy. Ok, here is what i didn't like. The cast iron grates had some kind of black colored substance on them, something like shoe polish!. It made them look good out of the box , but was really hard to clean off. I kept finding black residue after washing them several times. I finally stopped using the grill and am looking for another one."
3,Cooks well enough; assembly was a bear!,"Received grill in less than a week; very satisfied! But, when we tried to put it together, we found the holes to mount the brackets that hold the cooking grids were misdrilled. The cooking grids stuck up in the air, probably 2-3"" higher in the front than the back; very uncool, 'cause I didn't think a hot dog would stay on there! SO, hubby had to redrill the holes so he could mount the brackets in the correct position to cook. And that was NOT an easy task, considering you are drilling through cast iron! But, he was able to make it work, and it cooks very well now.I would have complained to the company, but we were hungry and wanted to grill that day! Just beware of this problem, as it might happen again."
1,"not a ""cast iron"" hibachi","It is NOT cast iron. It is pot metal. Pot metal is brittle and fractures easily. It is not something you should make a hibachi out of. Worse yet, the design looks nice but places great stress on the metal, in all the wrong places, thus all but guaranteeing failure. Well, I guess you can tell that I'm an engineer. Anyway, the thing broke the first time I tried to use it. I'm not sure what else is out there but how cheap is cheap if what you get is useless? Hey, d'ya suppose it mighta been made in China? Amazon, you should not sell this product."
4,Parts missing but great Hibachi,"My new Hibachi arrived looking great, but missing the hardware kit to put it together. There was a help number in the box to call, and 15 minutes later the hardware kit was on its way. It did arrive and the Hibachi has performed beautifully."
1,Cheap Piece of Junk,My girlfriend found this thing in the bargain bin at a local store for 5 dollars and bought one. Assembly was a nightmare and it just feels cheap. Rusted after the first use. I was looking for a replacement on Amazon when i saw this and had to comment. Stay away from this unless it is for maybe a single use.
3,Great space saver BBQ Grill,"Pros: It's cheap and economical! Portable and space saver.Cons: Only good for small cooks. Takes time to heat/warm up. It cracked in one area of the overtop grill when I was grilling. Not sure how long it will last but need to take good care of it, if you want it to last longer."
3,A little disappointed,We had a hibachi years ago and we loved it. This one has rough edges and is yet to perform for us. We were disappointed for the price.
4,Marsh Allen Hibachi,"This is a great little grill that we purchased from Amazon. Now that there are only two of us, we do not need a larger grill. This item is easy to start and fun to use. The grill came in parts so you had to put it together but we had a power screw driver that made the job easier. We now use the small grill instead of the large one most all the time. It is not so heavy that you are prevented from moving it from place to another but it is heavy enought to stay in place when using it as a table top grill. As I said before, this is a ""great little grill."""
3,"eh, it's okay","Where to start? I had to redrill the holes on the upright brackets that hold the grills in place. The brackets lean away from the unit so that when you insert the grills, they slant upwards at the handle end and are not level. The handles would have been part ways over the coals. The original holes were not even close!! The new holes that I drilled did not even touch the existing ones. I also had to add about 1/4"" worth of washers on the bolts for the uprights to make them stand up vertically (pushing the bottoms out and the tops inwards). I had to file some iron off of the grates in order for the handles to fit properly. So, if you own a small machine shop and/or aren't afraid to use a little elbow grease it's just about perfect. Another piece of junk from China. I looked all over for a similar product but could not find one. After all is said and done, it did perform the job that I bought it for. $25 can I really complain?"
3,Marsh Allen 30052,"The cast iron parts of this grill are great and a huge upgrade from a steel version I had before. However, the handles to the adjustable racks are made of a very light weight sheet metal and one of them broke off on my first use (resulting in the cast iron rack breaking). I contacted the company and they said they would send a replacement part. I am going to replace the handles as they are two flimsy for the cast iron racks (they are the same handles that are used for the much lighter steel racks on the cheaper grills).I rated this 3 stars because this was fairly cheap for cast iron, and the cast iron itself is fine (which is nice), however I downgraded it because the construction around the cast iron was fairly low quality."
1,My uncle put together a broken grill for Xmas,"I'm one of the many, many, MANY people who got a defective unit. I sincerely implore anyone who reads this comment to NOT risk the purchase of this item because you are likely to receive a defective unit.This product was sold by Amazon and I therefore have no choice but to roll over and accept defeat."
1,Not what I wanted picture deceptive,"The picture of the grill make is look like is is similar to the ones from the 70's with a grill bed of at least 4-5 inches. This one is only like 2 inches, and does not hold enough charcoal. The cost of shipping back and paying the initial shipping makes it not worth returning. Total flop. I have learned do not shop on line to deceptive."
1,"Bad Product, Poor Customer Service","Ordered one of these last summer. I had to file down the grill plates with a metal file to get them to fit the racks. I filed them ALOT to make them fit. One of the rack handles was broken in half. I called Kay home products. The woman said she would get a new handle right out to me. 3 weeks later I called to ask where the replacement handle was. I got the ""check's in the mail"" runaround but I could tell the one woman customer service department just forgot to mail the part. It arrived a week after my second phone call. I would not fool with all this again."
2,less than I expected,"after assembling the grill one of the movable racks did not sit even, tilted to one side, it is okay for a few small items only"
1,Lousy grille,"This hibachi is a piece of junk. It stinks, literally. It was made in china and god knows what they coated this thing with. I made chicken breasts the first time with it and the chicken was full of black paint or whatever was on the grates. I ate a piece and didn't die or get sick yet, but it was bad looking. I sanded the grates to remove the black crap, but who knows what's under that. I may throw this thing out. I'm very disappointed in the quality or lack of. I wouldn't ever buy another. Be warned. Stay away from this one."
5,hard to find but worth it,"living in florida, we grill out 12 montha a year.however, this year, we have had several bouts of cold, wet weather.this fits into my fireplace perfectly,the flue pulls the carbon monoxide up the chimney and i get grilled steaks in the comfort of my den. the hibachi is pretty well made and works perfectly"
1,Not So Hot Hibachi,Unit arrived with incorrectly drilled holes for vent on one side. I had to redrill only to find that there is insufficient air space between coal grate and base of grill to provide enough updraft to ignite coals. Would not buy another.
1,It broke first time,"Assembly was simple, but the grates didn't line up. During the first use, one grate cracked from the heat of the charcoal, and it wasn't even in the low position! Don't waste your money on this!"
4,cast inron hibachi,this hibachi is well made and easy to assemble. It is just want I needMarsh Allen 30052 Cast Iron Hibachi 10 by 18-Inch Charcoal Grillas a single person who enjoys grilled food. I am very pleased with it.
2,need better quality craftsman ship.,I bought this grill in hopes it would do me on my small grilling a few pieces of thin cut Korean style meat. I will have to do some grinding of the parts like the slots for the grill height or the grill rack itself. It is a shame that quality is tossed out the window to have things produced out side the US like China. I see this in many Items not just this product. I will do some grinding and it will work when I get finished. I will burn and oil the grills once I have them ground to fit correct. It is a shame that too many Items like this come from China.
5,Great Habachi,More than I expected. Excellent product. If using only one side place a barrier in the middle (like a brick) to maintain heat.
3,What I expected!,This product is pretty much what I expected. The only issue is the grills are casted (somewhat crude) as the grill body and the adjustment/rack in the back are too! They just don't interlock with much accuracy! You can't really trust them to stay where you adjust them to height. I had the right side fall on it's own and a portion of my food fell. I'm mechanically inclined so I ground out the rack/adjustment to accept the grilles more consistently. More than most would do if possible. The parts are not well made/accurately.
3,Not bad,"Was missing hardware to put together , called the number and was sent to me . Looks ok but not as well built as the old ones though"
5,Great little grill,I bought a steel version from a harware store last yeat and it barely lasted one season. I had a real Cast iron grill years ago and loved it.I bought this one in the spring and it is great. The metal is not as good as I remember the original was but it does the job. Makes great steaks over the charcoal. Have not see anything better in this price range plus it had free shipping.
3,BBQ AT HOME,"does the job but not practical for a balcony barbecue, too much finickiness and getting rid of ashes is messy. You absolutely need the coal starter to prepare the coals. My original BBQ came cracked but was replaced rapidly."
4,Works for me!,"Old fashioned Hibachi type grill. Big enough for 2 porterhouses & with charcoal (not briquettes) can cook them in less than 5 minutes to medium rare - Smokin!The legs are stable.I would have preferred the more steeply sloped design of a true Hibachi (deeper sides & uses less charcoal), but oh-well, the Japanese versions are probably 3 times as expensive.Needless to say, the Chinese engineering quality sucks, the grates do not fit evenly in all the slots, but a little touchup with a file takes care of that, and there was a stress crack developed in one of the grates the first time the sucker was fired up."
3,Poor construction watch out for cuts!,"Poor and not precision casting quality. Cast iron parts were not deburred and all the edges were razor sharp. I took a shop griller abd went over the whole unit to remove these dangerous sharp edges. The main grill assembly was not square making one leg 3/16"" short. Put washers between the leg and the base to lever it. One of the grills had a thickness flaw in the back where it goes in the vertical back slotted pieces to raise and lower it and was not level when inserted but stuck way up. Had to take off over 1/8"" on the backside with a grinder to get it to work correctly and level. After all the work, I am satisfied with it but I spent over an hour fixing it so it would work."
2,Marsh Allen hibachi review,"OK, so it's less then $30 bucks. But for a little ingenuity (granted you will loose portability) and a grill grate from a home improvement store, you will have a much better solution for grilling. This item is a cheap manufactured in China thin cast iron product that is painted black to make it look passable. It smelled toxic when I made my first charcoal fire and the right grate cracked during the heat from fire #1. The grilling grates do not line up flat with the charcoal area so even heat will be a problem. Once it breaks in, I am hoping it will be passable for small grilling jobs. If it lasts three years it will save it's cost in the savings from wasting charcoal in a a larger grill. But if you are quality conscious, buy a better product or a LODGE. I know I wish I had."
3,Ok Grill,"Good grill for the price, however one of the grill plates was severely bent, so it wouldnt fit, and the wooden handles were loose and cracked. Still useable, but was upset about the bent plates."
2,Chinese Hibachi,"I looked high and low for an old fashioned hibachi at retail stores. No luck. Then I went to Amazon and was pleased to find just what I wanted at a reasonable price. The goods arrived and the hibachi wasn't all that complicated to assemble. But I immediately noticed that the removeable cast iron grates are of dubious quality. And, sure enough, when I used this item for the first time one of the grates developed a split. The second one split on the third use so color me less than impressed."
1,Plastic smell,There was a strong plastic smell the first time I used the hibachi. I did a thorough cleaning before I lit the coals but that didn't seem to help. They also use cheap hardware to attach the parts together. I won't use the grill again.
2,Not great,"This is definitely not great quality like to grills that were sold during the early 80's. Lighter cast, grills do not fit well into holders and is too shallow to hold heat properly.Not what I was expecting."
1,Absolute garbage,"Do not buy this! Out of the box assembled one of the grills hung at an angle,(that makes it hard for even cooking) After 3 uses (2 weeks) completely rusty! This is a cheap piece of junk...AVOID!"
2,Slightly disappointed,"This product had two redeeming features: 1. It was less than $10.00 2. Free shipping.I got what I paid for. It was impossible to assemble because the parts did not fit each other. I had to drill holes for attaching the handles properly. The parts, once all in place, did not fit each other, so that one rack was level, the other tilted....it made it difficult to grill hot dogs without them rolling off. In short, it was poorly manufactured, but I used it until it burnt a hole through the planking on the deck--and then I set it out for the scrap metal scavengers."
2,sagging rack,I just assembled my new Marsh Allen 30052 Hibachi. All the parts were there and assembled very easily . However the racks are not even. The right rack looks like they ground off to much of the casting causing it not to lock in correctly and sag.
2,Disappointed in Quality,"Received this as a birthday gift. Was extremely excited when I opened the package. That quickly turned to extreme disappointment upon trying to assemble the grill. All the parts were there and it seemed to be of good quality. However, there are 4 legs and clearly there were only 3 sets of holes drilled in the bowl. Who wants a 3 legged Hibachi? Perhaps the workers at the Chinese factory can't count. So this means I'm either stuck trying to use a lop-sided grill or will have to find a machine shop (and pay extra for this) to drill the 4th set of holes so I can put the last leg on. This is the first time I have ever purchased or received anything from Amazon.com that I was disappointed in. And I've bought a lot of stuff in the last 6 years. My poor sis felt terrible about gifting something defective; too much trouble to try to return this pig."
1,Hibachi,"Poorly made, parts did not fit together and metal of grill made it impossible to bend and fit to screw together.. and cooking grills fit into angled slots at severeangle and made cooking area too steep to put food on. Return too difficult in our situation, going to absorb mistake."
3,MADE IN CHINA,This product was made in China. Very rough cast iron. looks like it was cast in someones back yard. Item has sharp edges and the grates do not fit correctly fit into the slots.
1,Absolute Junk,This thing broke the first time i used on the first camp trip of the year. A giant crack split down the side making it dangerous to use. We have to stop getting things made in China. The quality is simply too poor.
1,one use broken,i used the grill for the first time and the grate holder cracked food fell to floor I would not recommend this cheaply made grill made in china
5,"Love it, for the price.","My wife and I owned a hibachi, many years ago and we loved it, used to set it up next to our picnic table and kids and guests enjoyed everything. You have to cook small and thin sliced meats, for better results. But it all comes out well cooked and hot. We love it. And you can't beat the price."
2,help my grill has cracked by the second bag of charcoal,"Both of my cooking grills have cracked!Not good....Please contact me and send new please. My grill is 2 months old, stored indoors and maybe used 20 Times.HELP!"
4,Hibachi barbeque,It works very well and does all we want. The onlt problem is the grid for the coals is not cast iron and the gaps are too big to hold firelighters
1,This thing is JUNK!!!!,"If you are considering purchasing this hibachi, DON'T! It is shoddy and the ""cast iron"" it is supposedly constructed of is really what is known in the trade as ""pig iron"". Extremely brittle, and becomes more so as you subject it to heat. One of the grill brackets broke when I set the grill into it for the first time after putting it together. It is actually spray painted black to give the appearance of real cast iron but is actually so full of alloys and contaminants it is really the color of aluminum. Do you wonder why it is so cheap to purchase??? If you really feel like literally throwing away you money, do buy this item. A much better product is the LODGE hibachi...YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
4,Best of its type now available,This is a very convenient little grill and cooks well. It is the best of its type since it is made of cast iron and not pressed tinny metal like most of the other hibachi 2 burner grills with adjustable grill height that I could find available at this time. It is not as good however as the cast iron grills of this type that were available in the 1970's which were of even heavier and strudier construction But again it is far superior to all others that I could find that are available at this time. If anyone comes across better ones like they used to be please let us know and where to get.
5,Great Hibachi,I have a propane grill but sometimes I just want a steak with that great flavor from cooking over charcoal. This is a great little grill. The reviews I read indicated the need to do a lot of filing to smooth the rough cast iron. I did have to do some to make the grates fit better but other than that everthing went together fine. The cast iron has a very rough appearance but doesn't create any problems. The instructions showed the grate brackets attached to the outside of the grill but they clearly have to be installed to the inside. You can buy other less expensive table top grills but the sheet metal will rust in no time and you can't adjust the height of the cooking grids. You can just use a little charcoal and grill on one side if you just want four burgers or a couple of steaks. I wouldn't trade this little Hibachi for any other small charcoal grill.
5,Never a disappointment,"I remember this little guy from when I went camping as a child, was glad to find it again for my return to camping.This did a great job on the steaks & chicken, then later used it at the lake for hot dogs & marshmellows. It even heated up the water for coffee, it was hot enough to boil the water yet didn't damage the glass coffee pot (from an automatic drip maker .... lol). I need to find one double the size for grilling for more than 2 people .... lol."
3,A good value for the money.,A good value. The grilling grates are a bit uneven but I did not expect perfection for the price paid. If I get two grilling seasons worth of use I will be pleased. Good grill for cooking a small steak or a few burgers.
3,Not your Dad's Hibachi,"I read a lot of reviews on this Hibachi style grill that were pretty negative but I decided that at the price I would try it anyway. I am glad I did. It definitely is not the same quality as the old 70's grill and that's a shame but it cooks like the old one. Note to the manufacturer.....I would happily pay more for the old quality. I did not have paint on my handles, the parts fit okay and the cooking surfaces were even enough to not cause any problems. It is a good little grill for fast cooking for one or two people but if you need to feed more you better fire up the big fella."
4,love hibachi cooking,"Year's ago, I had a hibachi when my wife and I were first married . We loved the way it cooked and its size was perfect for two newlyweds.Our children are grown now and we are back to cooking for two. I have been looking for just the right grill and saw this one. It has surpassed my expectations. Just the right size. We carry it with us out in the boat for cooking on a beach. The food taste just as good as I remember from years past."
1,Made in China...,"This item was made in China and it shows. We could not find a Hibachi locally and we wanted a cast iron one. We bought this one and the 15 minute assembly took over 3 hours. None of the bolt holes aligned. We had to drill new ones. Then when we got them aligned, the grates would not set level over the grill. We probably used over $20.00 in stainless steel hardware to get this grill assembled correctly. Why didn't we return it for another one? Made in China - and it would probably be exactly the same."
3,Some difficulty to assemble,"It was cast so cheaply that the screws didn't always match up in the holes in order to assemble. I have had hibachi before ( in fact the old one just wore out after ten years) but this one seems inordinately heavy. Haven't actually used it yetbut am planning it use it in campgrounds while on vacation. Hopefully, the other issues won't play out as to use."
2,HABACHI,This habachi is not like the ones they used to make. It's too shallow and doesn't allow for a real hot charcoal base. Can't make a true char-rare steak. Not worth the effort to use over my gas grill.
2,Cast Iron Hibachi,"What can I say...it's another item that has to be assembled. I was so excitd to receive it and extremely disappointed to open the box to more screws and pieces than I ever imagined. I'm a widow who wanted to BBQ. If I wanted to assemble something, I'd have taken a class."
5,AG Washington Redskins,I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loved it. All redskins fans should own this!
4,I liked it.,I thought that this was a good book. I can see where people are coming from when they say say it is innapropriate for kids. I agree. But those that say it's not suitable for high school students are just plain silly. I'm a seventh grader and I could've handled it a couple of years ago. The best way I can describe it is kind of like an episode of 'Law and Order.' The author did a good job on writing about teenagers and how they act. I suggest this book.
5,<-----CLICK TO SEE A VIDEO SAMPLE OF THE PLASMAQUARIUM DVD,Length:: 0:58 MinsHere is a sample of the NINE aquarium tanks on the Plasmaquarium Vol. I DVD.
4,"like an aquarium, kind of","This DVD is great, it is very clear and has lots of options and different fish tank scenes. I only wish they would zoom out a little, the shot is fixed on one section of the tank which gives the illusion of a larger area because the fish swim in and out of the frame but on the 61"" plasma its on in my office the fish are the size of my head (which is big) so its not as realistic as it could be. I think it would look more realistic (as far as fish size) on a 37"" or smaller TV. Of all the scenes it has its missing the sunken pirate ship with bubbling treasure chest scene, I men come on this is supposed to be an aquarium right?"
3,Fish Tank Made Easy.,Fun addition to your big screen TV. Makes for fun conversation when you have guests. The menu's are a not that user friendly. Wasn't really worth the money. Buy it used if you get it!
3,Not Life Size!,"The aquarium dvd is not what I was hoping for. I believed it would be a life-sized visualization of a fish tank. In fact it is only a visualization of the center portion of a tank - the fish are not sized to fit the screen - too big, too small - generally not satisfactory."
1,Be Very Careful,"Personally, knowing what I know now, I would have never wasted my money. They are not actually deceptive in their advertising but the view that you get, even in widescreen, is as limited in visual scope to what is shown on the DVD cover. It is a view of what is probably a very small portion of a larger aquarium. You very soon get tired of looking at fish swim around, over, under, and through the same rock and blades of grass!"
1,TREMENDOUSLY DISAPPOINTING...,"After reading many of the reviews listed below, I feel cheated and misled. This DVD has disappointed me more than any other purchase I've made at Amazon over the last 10 years. The lighting and footage just aren't up to par. The fish are too big and the camera doesn't appear that focused. I have no clue how anybody could rate this 4 stars - it's quite frankly horrible.Save yourself some pain and disappointment and get something else. I truly hope some company will step up to the plate and produce a compelling salt water aquarium DVD.I ultimately ended by the Marine Aquarium screensaver by Serene Screen which is a great product. Unfortunately they don't have a DVD version of that yet."
3,Plasmaquarium Aquarium,Although this is a good idea... the picture quality is not the best. More background would be desired. I do like the fact that you can select natural sounds or have a variation of music to select. My preference is the natural sounds.
1,Too Soft!,"A little soft would be good, but this is waaay too soft and floppy. Only get this if that's what you want. They really should NOT call it ""raging hard on"". Very misleading!"
3,Nite White,"Still trying to determine if this is the Turbo or not. The box does not say Turbo, except for a sticker. Hmmm..."
1,"Stay clear, bootleg product","Videoasia/Panmedia is notorious for taking public access movies and re-release them to rip fan off. These are the exact transfers from old vhs tapes, being so lazy High Voltage does not even have the right audio (Japanese instead of Cantonese). Back in 2001, 2002 where you have to grab everything you can find if you are a big fan, this might be a healthy welcome. However at this day and age, vhs transfers? really?If you want this so bad, go to youtube, youtube is enlarging their collection with public access stuff, i'm sure you can find them somewhere.This is so bad I wish amazon allows me to rate 0 star. This is a review from someone who has bought this package and forever regret."
1,Just read the first 30 pages - that is all you need to know.,"This is one of the weakest anthropology books I have ever read. The book starts out fairly strong in the first chapter, describing misconceptions of the the West in viewing Balinese society and explaining the importance of Bright Face for the both the individual and all of society. Wikan should have stopped there. However, she felt the need to repeat herself for several hundred pages in a meandering discussion. My advice: go to the library, read the first 30 pages, then put it back on the shelf."
1,Save Your Money,"If you have a serger now, you will find as much information in the instruction booklet that comes with your machine as you will find in this book. If you are just considering purchasing a serger and want to understand what serging is all about, you will be afraid to even try to serge.I found the black and white sketch/drawings very confusing -- photographs would have been better. There is not one instruction or technique not covered in my intruction manual that came with my serger."
3,Good info but illustrations are confusing,I am new to serging but have purchased several books on it. This book seems to have a lot of good information and is easy to read. The illustrations were stylized and very good from an artistic standpoint but I would rather have photographs.
4,SImple and Clear,I had checked this book out from public library until they thought I was going to steal it! I'm glad to have found for purchase. It is a simple complete book for beginners and intermediate users of Baby Lock serger.
3,Essential for Learning Modelica,"This is an essential book if you are using Modelica. I have found it invaluable, with excellent examples and decent explanations. The 3.0 version of the Modelica specification was rewritten by Fritzson, excerpts of it are essentially identical to passages from this book (the 3.0 specification is a definite improvement compared to the 2.2 specification).My only serious complaint is that page numbers in the index do not match the actual pages; they are off by 2 for pages greater than about 80. This is a minor nuisance, but because it is consistent one learns to adjust."
1,What you would expect.,"The jacket cover, which talks about Walsh being independent and unbiased belies the fact that Walsh's report was issued two days before the 1991 election between Bush and Clinton. There can be no doubt of the animus Walsh had for Bush. If the things in this book are true, after spending 100 million dollars and 7 1/2 years, Walsh could have gotten more convictions than Oliver North for spitting on the ground.This book is terrible"
4,"Sometimes wordy, always chilling account of a very dark time","At times, this reads as a text book. At times, it reads as a spy thriller. Walsh goes into great detail on the investigation and attempted prosecution of those involved in the Iran-Contra scandal. This book is best suited for those interested in the affair, and are anti Reagan/Bush. I was moved by the compassion of Walsh when after interviewing Reagan, felt it would have been more damaging to our nation to try and prosecute Reagan when it was apparent alzheimers had set in. Walsh felt Reagan knew more then he said, but he also knew that the alzheimers would have been humilitaing to Reagan, and would have made prosecution impossible."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"This is reasonable, apart from The Scorpion is the new Venom? The Green Goblin is treating his relationship with Spider-Man as a series of battles, done to his twisted code. His problem is that he is about to be assassinated in prison, and only Spider-Man can get him out. Mostly due to the fact he is going to murder his hostage Aunt. Images of well built girlfriends and other relatives, friends and associates of the pushing up the daisies varieties haunt Spider-Man throughout. Much of the story is internal to the wallcrawler here, not really any of the usual battles with quippage."
4,"Muni, WWII & Tommy-Guns; what more could you want!","This WWII film does have a certain aspect of propaganda to it, but the tense storyline is riveting and will keep you glued to your chair until the last scene (which isn't exactly what you'll be expecting). Muni puts in a fine performance, as always. Overall, an enjoyable war drama."
4,Strike at dawn,I have been trying to find this movie on DVD for a long time. It is a classic ww2 story that illustrates the resistance of the Norwegian people. Very good movie.
3,Great example of WWII era War Movie Production,"Made in the 1940's while WWII was still happening, this movie is very typical of the ones made during that time period. One part love story, one part actioneer, and one part propaganda they all start out with a peaceful life that is interrupted by the bad Axis guys. (in this case the Nazis). When pushed to far, everyone fights back and it builds up to a climactic end. Always ending on a note of hope because no one really knew how the war would end at that time."
2,"OK for sleeping, I guess","I just couldn't get into this at all. And I'm still mad at her for breaking up one of the few great bands of the 90s, Belly. They were awesome live. Bands are ALWAYS better than solo artists. Bring back Belly."
2,Murky and diluted,"I was curious to see how Tanya Donnelly's 2001 solo effort compared with 'Sunny Border Blue' (one of the best of 2001, in my book). The results: whereas Kristin Hersh continues to improve with age, Tanya Donelly's muse seems to be napping. Sure, it has its moments; but the best of those moments fail to measure up to the weakest stuff on 'Sunny Border Blue'. This is the musician responsible for 'Not to Soon' [The Real Ramona] and 'Slow Dog' [Star]? I guess she is the George Harrison of the Muses after all."
4,Return to bizarrepop land,"After 5 years since ""Lovesongs For Underdogs"", Tanya's new LP was either going to be a brilliantly crafted work or something that had been let lie too long, like a lump of cheese at the back of the fridge - still edible, but really you don't want to. Thankfully it falls closer to brilliantly crafted. It is still her beautiful pop sensibilities wrapped around wonderfully bizarre arrangements and lyrics on songs such as ""Wrap-Around Skirt"". Its times like that that the LP is reminiscent of Belly's first album ""Star"", but largely the album is a natural step forward from her previous solo offering. She has shed the ""safeness"" of the commerciality of that album and yet still kept it accessible and familiar. Standout tracks: ""The Night You Saved My Life"", ""Keeping You"", ""Wrap-around Skirt"", ""Another Moment""."
4,*grins*,"After a hiatus of nearly five years, Donelly is back in full swing and more beautiful than ever. Now she's not merely just a musician, but also a momma and it shows (""Keeping You""). However, I don't think motherhood has softened our songstress in the least - her lyricism is still as sharp and witty as ever. Afterall, how could I not love a song that proclaims that ""everyday brings a new breed of [donkey](""The Night You Saved My Life"")? Slightly less poppy than her previous release ""Lovesongs for Underdogs"" and the work she did with Belly, ""beautysleep"" shows a newer, truer, and more musically adventurous side of Tanya Donelly."
4,waking up is hard to do...,"when i heard that this album was going to be hitting the shelves i was nervous. i'd heard a couple of tracks live over time, but there was this nagging sense that i'd been listening to music so different from belly and throwing muses and what if i'd outgrown another one of my favorite artists...thank whatever powers that be that it wasn't the case...college rock tunes like 'slow dog' and 'dusted' that changed the way i looked at music have given way to smoother more adult tunes like 'another moment' and 'the night you saved my life' that reflect a whole new kind of emotion... a softer, gentler, calmer more content way of feeling...and it's good to be let in to it."
5,Tanya does it again!,"Tanya Donelly's songs are uniquely beautiful. Powerful songwriting combined with a sweet voice results in enchanting music. (And if you ever get the chance to see her live, go. She's as brilliant on stage as on disk.)"
4,Pop music!,"Sometimes I am just wondering how they define a CD is pop or not. From every perspect, this CD is so pop, the music is just perfect beautiful. But I know there's few people knowing Tanya Donelly. Give her CD a try. you will love it. Believe me, much better than any CD in Billboard top 40."
4,Best Tribe Album,"Overall, best Tribe album ever released. It is neither pretentious or overbearing. Class STS9. It is complex yet simple, harmonious yet cacophonous all in a way that offers the listener with a perfect balance. Much like any other band of a similar genre, like the Disco Biscuits, or for that matter the Grateful Dead their studio albums unfortunately do not give the band proper justice. While the album can offer an insight into their creative process, only once you see these guys live can you really gain a full appreciation of what they are all about."
5,artifact,"oh my, this new disk is amazingly good ear sex! i lack the ability go into detail at the moment because my head's nodding so hard, but i wanted to drop by and give the boys their due props. they are definitely at the top of their game right now. highly recommended. highly."
1,Sorry Effort,I was really excited about this album and I can not even begin to express what a total disappointment it was. I kept thinking the next track would have some life or some beat and it never got going. Before you invest in this maybe pick up a live show somewhere --if they allow taping of course-- and see for yourself if you can stomach STS9. Still can't believe how overwhelmingly BORING this album is/was. And believe me I have an open mind to the type of cutting edge experimental music this is trying to be.
1,Bad...Very Bad...and Bad Business.,"I bought this CD because only for ""All Night Thing"" of Invisible Man's Band. The rest of the songs I do not care, but for the worse, the disk is fully engaged and could not get the original version of the song in question. Bad business..."
3,Nostalgic.... but nothing special,"This CD basically has the exact music from the game NOT enhanced whatsoever. There does seem to be one ""new"" track at the end which is a pretty cool remix. This is good if you want the original sounding songs because they basically just recorded it straight off the games. It includes music from Legend of Zelda I, II, and III, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and Wind Waker."
4,"Good, but NES songs edited","Unfortunately, I bought this cd specifically for the NES and Ocarina of Time songs. Sadly, I found that the NES songs were merely bad remixes. The Ocarina of Time songs were intact, but about half of them were not present. The rest of the songs were great though. I would recommend this cd UNLESS you are in it for the NES songs."
3,could of had more,"the cd has a wide variety of mainly in game sounds with tracks lasting only a couple of seconds. and the staple of Zelda music(at least to me) was under played, the ocorana of time and majora's mask songs link plays weren't even in there. as well as all track info was in Japanese. The audio is of great quality and for players who love the games will find comfort and remembrance while listening."
3,A bit too video-gameish,"I loved this music when playing the game. It worked really well. However, a lot of the tracks are too short to really enjoy. Also, with ""game over"" tracks and stuff, it sounds like I'm listening to a video game. I'd rather just turn the game on and listen to it that way."
3,Excellent for discussion group,"These essays were a great starting point for a high school study group. It was interesting to compare and contrast prominent historical figures. Not the usual approach to studying history - we enjoyed it.I was able to get a used paperback for just a few dollars, so cost wasn't an issue for me. I'm sure I would have been unhappy if I had paid $40 for it, though."
1,2009 edition is an unproofed very bad OCR scan,"Something like a quarter of the periods are missing. The word ""can"" usually appears as""cam"". One of a pair of quotation marks is often missing. ""Make"" appears as ""snake"", ""1966"" appears as ""1933"", then ""1988"", and so on. I sent the (alleged) publishing ""House of Stratus"" the note below, which received no reply.Never, ever, buy anything from ""House of Stratus"".Dear Sirs,I am reading your edition of ""The Levanter"" and am about to advise my local library system that it is incontrovertibly the product of a low quality OCR scan which was not proofread at all. It is by far the sorriest excuse for a book that I have encountered in some 45 years of avid reading.I thought it proper that I should inform you of this fact before I advise the various library systems I use that they should never for any reason acquire anything from you and make similar representations on Amazon."
3,Just OK,"Perhaps because the Middle East is not my favorite region in the world, I was not particularly fond of this book"
3,Levanter Review,"Eric Ambler was a pioneer in the European espionage genre when he wrote in the 1930's, 40's, and 50's, but his work looks like pulp fiction in 2012."
4,Good but darker than the first,"I loved the first two dvds of this anime and this one continues the story effectively and gives good backstory for Rosette, Chrono, and Joshua. (The first two episodes are pure flashback which is a tad annoying, but is effective in making joshua sympathetic.) The next episode is gabriel hound which has the coolest vehicle yet. And the last episode is a standard christmas special focusing on Azmaria. The reason I don't give this five stars is that it is not nearly as funny as the first two dvds, and while the last episode is light Az annoys me, and watching the dub (I usually check both dub and sub.) Satella has the WORST german accent in history. I mean worse then Asuka in Evangelion dub"
1,Nu Metal that brings nothing new to the table,"Chimaria is a horrid band. These guys brings nothing to the table that hasnt been done about 100x before. First off, every song has a couple easy power cords that a 10yr old could play, and the drumming is weak. This band sounds like a replica of Korn, which gives them 2 strikes to begin with (Ok ,Korn had one good album, but thats it) and I dont hear any resemblance to Slipknot (as some reviewers had posted). Even though I really dont listen to Slipknot, they have more talent then this bunch of losers. If you want Good Metal, avoid this. If you are looking for a run of the mill, NU Metal band that sounds like something you have heard a million times before, then this is for you."
1,"DULL, BORING, DEPRESSING, JUST A BAD BAND","chimaria simply sucks. if you like them, you are just trying to stand out as a ""metal head"". this is not metal. these guys are not songwriters. slipknot is the same way. just a bunch of desperate musicains, playing dull power chords and screaming. i used to listen. i used to not enjoy. this music is boring, uncreative, repetetive, and the worst thing this side of linkin park."
4,clearing up inaccurate comparisons,"Why is this band compared to Slipknot? I don't understand it. Haven't you noticed that this band is actually heavy? Haven't you noticed that they don't try to rap? Haven't you noticed that their singer isn't cocky and annoying? Haven't you noticed that they don't [stink]? One listen to this album will prove that unlike the band they are compared to, this band cares about making good heavy sophisticated music instead of making whatever keeps people happy to keep your dumb gimmick going. My favorite song on here is ""Sphere"". ""Painting The White To Grey"" is also a really good song. The reason this only has 4 stars is because this isn't really one of those bands you can listen to their CD all the way through and remain intrigued and interested. At least, it hasn't been for me. You'll have to see for yourself. It's definately worth a try."
5,HeavY!,"Even tough chimaira's first album was nu metal which doesn't even sound like nu metal only a few sounds,overall is a pretty kick a's album.It's not their best but it's pretty brutal and heavy this is much more like a way heavier slipknot that's why it might seem nu metal and the only people who won't like this are true nu metal fans those who listen to those wannabe's bands like korn and rappers.This to me only sounds metal and not nu so if you have chimaira's other albums i say you should check this out,RAP AND HIP HOP SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not a Masterpiece By Any Means...But Not Terrible Either,This is an album that seems to be bashed more than praised and while it is definitely not amazing some parts of it can be enjoyable to listen to. Too many of the tracks just seem plain boring and thus I never had the urge to listen to them again. However there were the few that were enjoyable and they are good for when you just want some angry metal. Anyways I would probably not recommmend this people unless they know that the cd is mediocre for the most part with some high points in between.
3,Solid,"This is your average speed metal fare. It's not exactly phenomenal, but it'll get your adrenaline pumping. I usually listen to this CD to get pumped up. ""Let Go"" is still one of my favorite songs ever, and it has been ever since I heard it. this cd is nothing new but it shows incredible potential. Chimaira seemed like they were holding back alot on this cd. Iv'e heard a few new songs and I'm expecting alot from the Impossibility Of Reason cd they have comin out."
2,Could Be Worse.,"(...) Although the occasional thrash and old school metal passages can be heard, it is mostly just fodder for the more groove oriented, hip-hop influenced sound that you will hear throughout the record. I have to give them some respect for the bands' relentless tour schedule, so that is where the two stars came from. On top of the fact that their latest offering, The Impossibility of Reason, sounds like a different band entirely."
3,"DECENT , but a bit repetitive","I liked few songs: Severed, Forced LIfe, Dead Inside, And PAss out of existence.Howevere, overall album lacks variety and has a lot of boring guitar riffs and dull musicanship.Just listen to their later work: Self titled Chimaira.It is much more interesting!This one is ok, still has some brutal stuff!"
3,Cheap but worth the money,"some very good and rare tracks on this 5 CD set12"" versions also on hear includin' Oliver Cheatham... Get Down Saturday Night.T.Connection Do What You Wanna Do.10/10 for Value but only 3 over allMind you don't fall off your Platforms!!"
3,the voice is in spanish,I spent an hour installing this alarm only to find out the voice is in Spanish. And i cant find to get in in english. and part of my melted.
1,don't bother,"1)alarm is not very loud (so forget about using it as a panic device), 2)often did not pick up signal from transmitter (had to be close to vehicle) so forget using it to locate your car, and 3)design seems dangerous - leads get clamped to car battery but there is nothing keeping the clamps from coming off, causing a short, or worse a fire - yikes!"
2,not very durable,"I bought this originally for a trip thru Mexico to Costa rica. I bought the Spanish version. It works good enough for the price, but if you are on rough roads, the mounting bracket breaks off the alarm horn and then it is piece of junk. I have had two of them, and they both broke at the same place. Also like some of the other people said, the alarm itself is not very loud,and the remote doesn't work that good. Also trying to work with the manufacture was a total joke. I gave up and bought a real alarm"
2,feedback,"not impressed. woulden't buy another and don't like this one. If you have to get an alarm, save your money and get a good one the first time."
3,Wonderful Piece of Classic Comedy; Rotten video version,"Why didn't they FILM Lily ON BROADWAY instead of this Los Angeles performance is beyond me. I grew up with the Lily Tomlin-""On Stage"" LP, which is the same piece. It had marvelous sound effects and a full stereo soundstage. It was enchanting, and it was played all the time at quite a few parties back around 1978.When I purchased this video I was disapointed because of the cheesy production values, and it just wasn't fresh. I love Lily Tomlin, and as I have said this piece was an instant comedy classic, but the video doesn't get that fact through."
4,No WaY Outta the Cow Palace,"No Way Out was a great Smackdown PPV,Here are the matches:WWE Tag Team TitlesBasham Brothers & Shaniqua vs Rikishi & Soctty2HottyDecent opener, funny when Rikishi Banzai Drops Shaniqua 5/10Boyfriend vs Girlfriend MatchJamie Noble vs NidiaHorrible, crappy match, not worth putting on 2/10APA vs Self Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag TeamLike the other tag team match, decent 5/10Hardcore Holly vs RhynoBetter than expected, Great Brawl 6/10WWE Cruiserweight TitleRey Mysterio vs Chavo GuerreroAwesome match, Both really put a lot of effortinto it, though it sucks that Rey got screwed byChavo Sr. 8/10#1 Contender Triple Threat MatchJohn Cena vs Kurt Angle vs Big ShowGreat match, they all really put on a show 7/10WWE ChampionshipBrock Lesnar vs Eddie GuerreroAmazing match, best of the night, and Lesnars lastgood PPV match.

4,Good and exciting event !,"Really surprising event !the entire show was made with unbelievable results ,the ppv was short (the shortest since wwe created 2 brands ;2h25)but very good compared to the miserable performance we had the last 10 month.Eddie guerrero won the title may be for 1 night ...but its good to see someone else winning titles,Brock is a great athlete but he's so borrrring with the mich' ,and seems to have no brain...whatever...Goldberg presence cost Brock the title but he deserved what happened even Lance storm is more entertaining than Lesnar...All the matchs were good ,nearly excellent except for Nidia and Noble who really @%... but this PPv was worth buying it and i tell u Mania XX will be great but there wont be Angle and Guerrero in the main event as expected...WHAT?"

3,No Way Out,No Way Out was kind of a downfall. There was just a few matches that lived up to the hype but none other than the main event.Undisputed Title[c]Brock Lesner Vs Eddie GuerreroThis match was not the greatest because of the interference by Goldberg leding Eddie to win the undisputed titleBig Show Vs Kurt Angle Vs John CenaThis was the best match of the night and Kurt winning the match O it's True it's TrueJamie Noble Vs NidiaOne of jamie's best matches[ha ha] just kidding.

3,Cute but doesn't hold much,"It's cute! It looks just like a stuffed animal that you can wear as a back pack but its compartment doesn't hold anything really, Its also hard to keep clean. It picks up dirt fairly easy. If you just want a stuffed animal to carry around it works great."
2,Many glaring omissions,"Hitchcock is my very favorite film director, and I think he's definitely one of the best, if not THE best, directors ever, so I was very disappointed to read this book which only skims over Hitch's life, giving some films barely a page or two. Taylor looks at Hitch's many movies with neither a critical or even historical eye--and many, many details are left out, and many facts are just plain backwards, especially that ""Notorious"" was based on an idea provided by David O. Selznick, and that ""Spellbound"" started as Hitch's idea (it was in fact the other way around, with the recently depression-cured Selznick wanting to make a film about analysis; in fact, in the few paragraphs afforded to ""Spellbound,"" Mae Romm, Selznick's therapist who acted as an advisor on the film--and set--isn't even mentioned!). Donald Spoto's two books about Hitchcock, one a film-by-film analysis and the other a straight biography, are much better than this slight volume."
2,Not Up to Mayor Standards,I typically love Joe Gunther mysteries but found this to be a bit boring. Usually Mr. Mayor gets to the heart of the story a lot sooner than he did with this offering.
2,Repetitive Gameplay,"This game is higly repetitive.You get a car and thers one guy sitting and driving(you controling it) and one guy sticking out of the window like some dog with guns,shotting at others(you control this too)and others(the comp players) shooting at you.You drive and shoot...............Highly repetitive!!!!!!!The cars are not so good neither is the nitro and the guns are disastrous.You will love it for the first three,four races then it gets repetitive.Not recomended."
3,word up gansta?!!,"wait aminute I have to grab my balls before I review this one.this game is like need for speed and 25 ta life had baby and named it 187 ride or die!!!this game is simple enough;race to finish first,there is no second place,gangsta. Use an assortment of weapons to dipose of your enemies along the way upgade your cars and dont wreck the ride homie,word."
4,"Interesting, Thought-provoking material","The book looks at some of the most well-known sciptures with a differeent interpretation than that of fundamental traditional religion. I found it an interesting, thought-provoking read."
2,Face is too small,"I didn't realize how small the face of the watch was. I don't wear glasses, so I consider myself to have good eye sight but I strain to see the time on it. It was cheap, so I guess I got what I paid for!!"
2,not as shown,"The face on this ""casual"" watch was shown and descrbed as ""yellow"", but what I received had a gold metallic face. Not sporty and very odd combination with a resin case and band. Product not as shown, but not worth returning for $3.99 shipping fee. I was really looking forward to wearing the one that was shown. Just poor luck that the wrong thing got shipped."
3,You get what you pay for,"Watch was small in person. I wanted something with a soft band, because I type all day. Band was comfy, but the plastic clasp kept digging into my wrist, and I finally took the watch off after a few hours. For $10.00 you can't expect much."
2,its like a little kids watch,I have it on my lanyard at work because it wouldn't begin to fit around my wrist. It is made for a tiny tiny wrist. Like a ten year old or younger. nice looking watch though.
4,Historical Novel of Colonial Quebec,"The Golden Dog is a historical novel of Quebec during the reign of Louis XV. The main character is Angelique de Meloises, who is as unscrupulous as she is ambitious. She's so ruthless she enlists the aid of the local witch, and that doesn't end well for anyone.Equally important in the novel is Col. Pierre Philibert, an honorable man who is attempting to stop a cadre of dissolute French (the Grande Compagnie) from taking advantage of the colonists of New France. The compagnie plots against Philibert to further enrich themselves with the material goods of the colony.Apart from the disparaging reference to George Washington, I enjoyed this historical foray."
5,Lushly evocative musings,"Thhis album is one of the most beautiful that I have ever listened to. This is quite possibly one of the best roadtrip albums ever. Music such as this is perfect for reflection - quiet, slow, contemplative, complementing your thoughts instead of crowding them out. It is music to fall asleep to, music to wake up to, dreamland music, that stuff so right, so perfect that at times, it becomes a part of everything around you, and you only miss it (and miss it so acutely) when it is gone. Try this album out. After the party, when only your REALLY good friends are around, place this album in the player. Sit down and talk. Listen. Enjoy."
3,For the pain....,"It's an even gentler Mojave3. Neil's unmistakable voice carries on through more somnolent songs. These tracks are fragile, and a careful ear will appreciate the depth of the lyrics beneath the gossamer surface of the melody.This album is sure to please fans of Mojave 3. The dreamy shoe-gazer in the intelligent music-listener is sure to be satisfied!"
5,"Great, as expected.","I love Neil's compositions. I find him incredibly talented. A fan of slowdive and, especially mojave 3, I knew I was in for a treat!... And was not disappointed. It's different than his other songs with mojave ( and of course than the wall of sounds of slowdive), more intimate, simpler, but exceptional. It is nice to hear yet another side of Neil Halstead. I always love his voice also. The lyrics are intimate and deep. For me all the songs are withstanding many listenings.It's so different from his other works, though, that I would expect some folks not to follow him in such simple music."
5,Amazing depth and mood,This is one of the best albums I have ever heard...its one of those rare albums where I want to play every song in order and never skip a track. On my pod lying in the park looking at the sky and listening to this album makes for a great day.
3,Doesn't support all time zones :(,"I really wish that I had done proper research before buying this watch from Amazon.comThis watch is not a true ""world time"" watch because it does not support all time zones. I live in India which has time +5:30 hours from the GMT. The timezone of my country does not appear in this watch.Although I can use this watch, most of the features (like time transfer) will not work for me because of the lack of partial timezone support.The description of this watch does not say that all time zones are not supported. But if you enlarge the picture you should be able to see if your timezone is supported by this watch or not.I hope you don't make the same mistake as I did when buying this watch.:("
5,Seiko Worldtime Flight Chrono,"Good service, fast handling. Great watch, easy to use, very usefull for airline and GA pilots. Timedifference settings done in a second. Fuel and distance conversions are easily done with the flight computer."
2,good book with a broken CD,I got this book on time and I was very happy until I found out that the CD that came with it was broken and I couldn't use it.
5,Medical Terminology,Book was in great condition when arrived. Received package in mail sooner than expected. Good price.
3,Wasn't sure what to expect.,More like a home made copy. Price was ok. Just not sure I want to display it which was the point.
1,"i like Scattergories, but not much value in the refill set","all u really get is 12 more lists. u can easily make your own. u do get 6 answer pads, but u could just use plain old lined paper or index cards."
1,Boo Loser!,"""Sparkledoll"" was by far the most inadequate novel I've read in a LONG time. I borrowed it from a friend who warned me about ""a few typos"", but I was NOT PREPARED for the grammatical mess that awaited me! PROOFREADING IS NECESSARY!! The chapters were so short that it should have been easy to go back and correct any errors in grammar or punctuation. What made it worse was that the story had potential to be an entertaining read, but the chapters never really tied together for me. I got to the end of the book and found myself wondering how the plot managed to escape me. I would NOT recommend this to anyone above a junior high reading level - a real disappointment."
1,laughable...,"I remember forcing myself to read this hot mess of a ""novel"" almost 6 years ago. No shade, but I think it's totally pathetic that the author is posting comments w/ attitude based on the fact that this version of the book is now out of print. How is that relevant?? The point is that she put out a subpar product. Period. Who cares if it's been edited and revamped now? There are a lot of us who spent money supporting her in the beginning, but you decide to wait until AFTER folk spend money on your book to come correctly? And then want to cop an attitude because they give it ""bad reviews""? Disgraceful.Feel free to go ahead and rate this review ""not helpful"" - just like you did with all the other unfavorable reviews."
3,Too Many Typos,"The story wasn't bad, however the author needs to hire a new editor and if she doesn't have an editor then she should get one. This book had way too many typos."
5,Lives Up To The Hype,"I had been hearing a lot about this ""Sparkledoll"" book. I read the book in one day. I was so captivated. I am a college student and the author re-creates the college scene-outside of the classroom, very well. She deals with some tough issues such as teen pregnancy, gangs, friendship and the ups and downs of relationships in a realistic fashion. It's not a preachy book. It's fun, and not to sound sappy, but it is a book that may make you laugh and cry. I had never heard of this author prior to reading this book, but I do hope that she writes more in the future."
5,Must Read!,"I was very pleased to be one of the first to read this book and I know I won't be the last.I couldn't put this book down. As I read into the wee hours of the night, I couldn't wait to read more of Lori's antics and stories. She painted the college scene so well that I felt like I knew these people. I'm sure many people who know Dorie will see themselves or people similiar to the characters in her book.I applaud Dorrie Williams-Wheeler freshman novel which shows a glimmer of the genius her work is destined to become. Rarely have I read a book written from a more original point of view than that of Ms. Williams-Wheeler.I look forward to seeing more of her writing. Her style is so personal and gripping. I can't wait to read more from her."
5,One of the Best Ever,"I grew up with this book in the 60s. It was originally published in 1957 -- which shows how incredibly cutting-edge this mid-century modern book was. Through the years later the lessons of the book about language and imagery remained in my mind, and as an adult I finally managed to locate an out-of-print copy. I'm glad it's been republished -- it's true classic by two masters of the era."
2,Disappointing text,"I was disappointed in the book. The text, which makes an attempt at rhyming is not well written and the pictures are very simple, line drawings. I would not recommend it."
5,GREAT PRODUCT.KEEPS YOUR HAIR LOOKING GOOD AND IN PLACE.,Great product keeps your hair shiny and in place. There is nothing else to say except its a great product
5,Good for any photo!,"I have used ACDSee photo products for years. I remember when it came outand it was not as popular as it is today. My family are photo takers,especially my parents . At holidays you would think you were some type of movie star. So thanks to the ease in this photo program, I am making a history tree of my family. I can take an old photo of my grandparents and ACDSee will help you fix whatever is needed to ""fix"" the shot. With this program it has a great tutorial section that explains how to use all their features. Some I did not know how to use! Expansion without getting blur,cropping,fixing those ""red eyes"" on most candid shots,can resize and move the picture around to where you like it. This is a great program for the expert or beginner. Its spelled out very nicely. Amazon services was always second to none with no disappointing dates on delivery!"
2,"Nah ,I don't like hanson's music","All right!not bad but I don't why but I don't like their music but the Hansons are o.k.I have no disagreements against them.Sorry to Hanson's fans but every people has their dislikes and likes.Why not the Hanson produce songs that are not to many drumbeats in it?Try more love songs. Fans of Hansons are not crazy about their musics but their handsome looks.I admit that at first a I also like Hansons,it is only that I realised that I actually like hansons but not their musics. That's my opinion."
3,Not what I was looking for.,"I expected something a little more insightful after reading the reviews, but the book was disappointing. Personally, I would not be interested in reading any of this author's other works."
4,Watch it before you Buy it...,"Word of warning - Tarkovsky's films tend to be SLOW. It's a great movie for various reasons, but definitely not for everyone. You'll either love it or fall asleep."
4,"Slow-moving, but hypnotically beautiful","This movie may require multiple viewings. It takes its time dealing with the subject of the soul of an artist from an seemingly aloof camera viewpoint. It's strangely hypnotic, filled with gorgeous black-and-white imagery. Not in everyone's taste, but anyone who loves the art of cinema should give the movie a try."
3,205 minutes of snail crawling fun.,"Do you like to watch paint dry for hours and then talk about what a visually stunning and spiritually meaningful experience you've just had? You're either zonked out of your minds on drugs or you're an Andrei Tarkovsky fan.In this one, the greatest Russian director since Eisenstein treats us to Ansel Adams type photos that move and lots of mist. There's also murdering Mongols who mercifully liven things up a bit.I have a soft spot for Tarkovsky, even if all of his films have the same theme: The story of a director in love with his camera. What the hell, he's the the best answer to MTV. In Andrei Rublev subplots consist of making a bell in ancient Russia. Good flick if you are very, very patient. Pass the vodka."
1,One of the worst best movies ever made,"Slow moving, ponderous, little character development, with chaotic plot detours to what little plot there is, and the final payoff after 3 hours of this is that you get the ""reward"" of viewing some static images of Russian orthodox icon art.I realize the film is from a different era, and about a different era and culture. Since there is an authentic feelto some of the scenes, the film has value in capturing a way of life that has become extinct. And yes, some of the film is quite artfully done. But the reviews saying that this is one of the best movies ever made left me expecting a whole lot more. I wasdisappointed spending 3 hours watching this movie from the local Blockbuster (VHS)."
1,ANIMAL ABUSE,"This movie involves sickening ANIMAL ABUSE. It's an animal ""snuff film"" and therefore needs to be ignored."
1,Extended Boredom,"That's what you'll get if you purchase the extended version. I am interested in just about any film that is in Russian, with English Subtitles. I loved Burnt By the Sun, and House of Fools. They were mildy stimulating intellectually, and very entertaining. Even if they had been considerably less artistic, I would still be interested in watching them because of my desire to learn Russian. Andrei Rublev on the other hand, is horribly boring, totally mindnumbing, and I cannot even force myself to watch it, as an exercise, and for the sake of learning Russian."
5,Life is a painting,"In this movie Tarkovski paints several small paintings, like Rublev paints icons. They all are linked together yet have no direct link. They depict life in Russia and the works of men and God through Orthodox Church. Tarkovski is Rublev. The movie as surely inspired some main directors, such as Emir Kusturica, as the night bathing nude scene of the pagans is very close to the dreamy wedding scene in Time of Gypsies. The movie is slow and sometimes difficult to reach the links (as for the long 30 minutes scene of the manufacturing of the huge Bell) but is Hypnotic and soulful. Rublev is a humble and pathetic character as he refuses the world, but doesn't attempt to change it. He's the weeping voice in the face of the crualty of the world."
3,Buy the RUSCICO version too ...,This was for me a 5 star edition of Rublev until I watched Ruscico DVD release ... I think Criterion should consider a new and better (anamorphic) edition of this great film.
5,profound and beautiful cinema,"the sheer breadth and scope of this movie is hard to put into words. it is structured as several interrelated short or extended episodes, extending in time across almost a decade, each related in some way to a medieval russian icon painter. some are almost vignettes (the opening sequence of a balloon flight), and others are complete stories in themselves (the concluding bellmaking episode). the violence, disorder, superstition and solemnity of medieval russia are in the background, but the focus is on a handful of characters who search for the meaning of life on earth. the film is surprisingly open ended, punctuated with beautiful and sometimes repeated symbols, emotionally rich, and ultimately ambiguous. it is quite long -- i needed three sittings to finish -- but also worth viewing more than once. next to ""solaris,"" this is my favorite tarkovsky. the supplementary materials are valuable and it's delightful the publishers could pack everything on a single disk."
5,Film perfection!,"I'm going to have to jump on the bandwagon for this one, and say it's great. The most beautiful cinematography I've seen, wonderful directing, acting, and story make this film instantly a favorite. I would recommend it to anyone. And the commentary on the DVD is perfect and non-intrusive (along with the other DVD ""extras""). A flawless film."
5,The Soviets Couldn't Keep a Good Film Down,"Albeit long at 3:25 minutes, 'Andrei Rublev' is often a stunning black and white masterpiece. Outlawed by the Soviet government, this classic chronicles the life of the titled Russian Orthodox monk as he paints splendid, although controversial, icons to decorate cathedrals and enhance the faith during the 15th Century. From the first aerial shot of a peasant gliding on a balloon to some of the battle scenes with the Tartars, the movie intensely zeroes in on its subject matter. Some of the frames show war and torture like few others, making it as urgent as today's films. Famed Director, Tarkovsky, also captures personal strife well from scene to scene, so the tension seldom falters. Excellent camera shots and marvelous cinematography enhance a truly vintage, underground cinematic work."
5,Possibly the greatest film ever made,"It may sound odd, and probably is, but there are very few films that one could seriously call the greatest film ever made. Intolerance by Griffith, Rules of the Game by Renoir and Citizen Kane by Welles are three obvious possibilities, but this film by Tarkovsky seems the greatest of these in scope, in art, and in depth of vision."
4,4 my '05 KTM 200 xc FMF gnarly pipe,The guard fits okay but not perfect. It took about 10 minutes to install after figuring where to position the hose clamps. It looks nice after the install.
