1,Such Books Are an Insult to God,"I understand that there are people out there (some of whom have reviewed this book favorably) who believe in a God who is little more than a petty, mysogynist, cruel, punitive, unstable, immoral human with superhuman abilities.This book is a blatant, commercial appeal to them. It will stroke their egos, making them feel wonderful about having been right in their human choice of one narrow religious belief over all the thousands of available religious, spiritual, and mystical beliefs in the world, thinking in their self-righteousness that they somehow were led to it by God, when in fact they are merely choosing the one that confirms their prejudices.They will find their desperate need for validation of those personal prejudices amply satisfied by books such as this.They will also have their spiritual growth stunted, and perhaps even reversed, by the exclusionary, judgemental, bigoted message it conveys."
1,A Divine Revelation of Hell,"This book portrays a traditional view of the devil presiding over hell tormenting souls. Not only is it repugnant that a righteous God would allow such a thing, Hell is most especially reserved for the devil as his judgement.I am amazed that this book even found its way to a publisher, let alone that it got printed. It is nonsense from start to finish."
5,"I suggest another good book called ""Spiritual War""","I am reading the book ""A Divine Revelation of Hell"" and so far, it's great. Very much information of how the spiritual world is. I wanted to suggest that another book that might backup Ms. Paxter's book is ""Spiritual Warfare"" by Ing. Others are ""Pigs in the Parlor"" and ""He Came to Set the Captives Free"" by Dr. Rebecca Brown. They are some good backups."
5,extremly eye opening!,"This book is incredible, it made me belive in jesus again.Very strong and interesting, a must must have!"
4,A moving work,"Many books written about God and spirituality sway from the messages in the Bible. Mary, however, stays true to the scripture, and therefore adds credibility.But the most credible part of the story are the descriptions themselves. They just sound so real, so intense, so true to what the Bible tells us about Hell.Read this book, even if you don't believe Baxter was in Hell, just to remind yourself of why you stay true to God's law."
5,Get a Clue... While There's Still Time.,"I read this book some years ago. Now that I'm dealing with some people still suffering from the sin of hatred, manifesting through racism, I'm tempted to buy them a copy and have it sent directly to them. Keep in mind that Jesus sends no one to hell - people send themselves there. It's their individual decision - not His. If you're not sure if you'll make it, look at your fruit... that's what it's for."
5,THIS BOOK IS REAL!!!,"I purchased and read this book over 9 years ago and I STILL remember it as if I read it yesterday! This is a very powerful book! I would advise EVERYONE who want to experience the TRUTH to read it. Another customer claimed that there were no ""biblical truths""..People please DON'T LISTEN TO THAT LIE!!! Please always remember that what Jesus told her at the end of every chapter, John the Baptist also said those things!! Repent for the time is near!. Please also remember we can't put God in a box and just say that HE only said this or that and that's it! I wouldn't test it and I do believe if she said she experienced those things, she did and it's very real! So please believe it!Enjoy this book! I know I did!God Bless You All!"
4,Gift books,"This book was not for me, but the person I bought it for loved it so it was a good purchase. Didn't take long at all to be received. Thank you."
1,Why can't I give it negative stars?,"I'm not sure whether the author is delusional or what, but the book reads like a poorly-written scare tactic. I can't help but think that if it were really divinely inspired God would have helped her to write a more readable and more believable book. Instead we have an unbelievable account, full of absurd gunk.If you are a Christian, don't waste your time with this book! It doesn't have the ring of truth to it. She claims that Jesus wanted her to describe Hell for us so that we would realize it is a real place and that we don't want to go there! I find it highly suspicious that she came out with ""A Divine Revelation of Heaven"" shortly after this book. Was Jesus equally concerned that we needed to know that Heaven is a good place?Don't waste your time and money on this book! Jesus' message is one of Love, not one of fear. I refuse to believe that Jesus has to resort to scaring us into following him!"
5,We Need a Divine Revelation of Hell!...,"Well, ya know peoples, We need a divine revelation of hell. some people just need to realize that they are lost, this book was written to do just that, convince us that we are lost. So i don't care about all the yada yada that some people have written for a review of this book. Maybe they need a Divine Revelation of hell right about now. ....Mike"
1,Laugh Out Loud FUNNY!!!,"This woman should team up with Steven Spielberg & write HORROR! Read it with a group of friends at a drinking party between shots of Tequila!!!The woman is a CHURCH OF GOD pastor! Ever visit one of those churches? Not very high IQ levels & incredibly guillible people. They also believe women who wear pants go to hell, women who wear jewelry go to hell, women who cut their hair go to hell. They go into ecstatic hysterical possessions ""of the spirit"" and roll around on the floor and scream. Some of them in the more rural mountain cultures pass rattlesnakes around.Nuff said!! This book is about as fun to read as stepping in dog dukey!!! Be very drunk if you want to enjoy reading it!"
1,Do not recommend this book,"This book is not a good purchase. However sincere the author may be, it contains questionable material. I would not recommend this reading to anyone. I don't know the author or her intentions, but I find it hard to believe that Jesus gave this vision to her."
5,Don't reject God's love!,"I feel that I need to explain another of the author's major point in this book. Ms. Baxter agrees with the majority, that God is a God of love. In the book, she gives the life story of various souls who have ended up in hell. Repeatedly, Jesus told Mary, these souls where told to repent, and did not obey. They rejected God's love for the temptations of the flesh. Their punishment was well known to them, yet they chose sin over salvation. While God is a being of love, He is also a wrathful God, who will brook no insult to His authority. People can choose to disobey God, and He still loves them and wishes for them to turn back to Him. However, if these same people never return to His care, and die with sin on their lips, He has made the consequences clear and will not coddle sinners."
5,A Divine Revelation of Hell,The book was in excellent shape. I purchased it for myself. The book arrived at the time it was due. I received a nice book for a good price.
2,Entertaining,"This is typical pentecostal stuff. This book certainly caught my attention.I think this type of story appeals to people who suffer from low self-esteem that are easily persuaded by this nonsense.It reminds me of the snake oil salesman who tries to scare you into buying his product.I would encourage anyone who reads this book and others by this author, that they read what the Bible says on the topic of heaven and hell.Remember the apostal Paul was caught up to the third heavens and wasn't permitted to speak of what he experienced. I believe the Bible only gives us a small glimpse of what is beyond the grave."
5,Doubters BEWARE!!! Believers BEHOLD!!!!,"Growing up the daughter of a Baptists Minister, this books simplies re-affirms what I have always been told....Doubters will always find fault in things they can't understand, whereas Believers take heed (Webster's Dictionary : to pay attention, to give consideration or attention to) to all that pertains to the Lord, through prayer. Mary K. Baxter did exactly what Believers do...she took heed to what the Lord revealed to her. Everyone should read this book and share it with as many people as you can...because maybe YOU can reach some Doubters too!!"
5,Horrors of Hell,This is my first review of Mary Baxter's book. I was very troubled as I read every page. Mary is very earnest in relating what she experienced. At no time ever does she foist any vain imaginings upon the reader. She is always trying her best to convince the reader that Hell is real and not worth experiencing...EVER!Who would wish to be stuck forever in the same place with every fear and worry constantly besetting your consciousness???To be forever removed from the Living God is horrible!At various times in her spiritual journeys to Hell she was shaken to the core of her being and only received healing relief from Jesus Christ.I have ordered the three tape English language version of her book and will relate what I hear after I listen.
4,Christian Stephen King?,"This book, if to believed should be read by every Christian. If these things were truly revealed by God, we as a Christan community need to read this and work together to bring this message to the unsaved. This book is somewhat hard to follow, the author tends to write as though speaking to you. The overall message is clearly presented, and very moving. This book is not for the squeamish."
5,Outstanding,I order that book and the day it came I started reading it. I never put it down I finished that book in one day. The book kept me reading and when I was finished I wanted more. If you want to know what hell is like this book is the one. Mary Baxter puts it in very clear terms. The book makes you want to get on your knees and confess all your sins and ask for forgiveness. I loved the book so much I told my husband to read and I also gave it to my mother and my mother-in-law. It's one of the best books I've read.
1,Let the truth be told,"You can only find the truth in the Bible, and not in this book. There is no where in the Bible that states Jesus would come for any person of this day and age, to do any of the things she has stated in this book. So people that agrees with this book should go to their bible, and find any scriptures that backs up the story of this book. Also, read 2 Peter 2:1-3; v10,11 & 13, at least, and see what these verses say. I would even dare to say she must have been having a nightmare."
1,"Satisfactory, eye-opening read, but falls short.","This book was fairly good. I think Mary Kay Baxter does a good job and she's doing a good thing wanting to convert people to Christianity. Things that happen in this book, though, what with worms, etc. gets repetitive. How many times can you read about a person picking worms from their skeleton, or dingy-gray souls trapped inside their skeletons before it becomes less and less of a shock and boring? Personally, I feel that the book is good, though a little far-fetched at times. Being a Christian myself, I can't DISPROVE what she says, put I also can't say a word of this has any truth to it either."
5,Divine Revelation of Hell,"The author, taken in the spirit by Jesus to hell, describes a place of unremitting heat, thirst, torment of body, mind, and soul from which one can never escape once they go there. This should be mandatory reading for every middle school child, harsh though it may be. Our children must be warned in the strongest manner possible of the eternal consequences of their actions. All adults should read this book, and know they will one day wake up to their eternal damnation or eternal reward. The time is short. Our Lord has said 'Behold, I come quickly!' We do not know the day or the hour when He will come. This book makes it abundantly clear what will happen to those who sin against themselves and against God. Let him who hath ears hear the Word of the Lord. Amen. Thank you, Ms Baxter"
1,Christian everywhere let's pray for Mrs. Baxter!,"I believe Mrs. Baxter went to hell but I don't believe Jesus took her. Sound more like Satan took her there. The Bible speaks of false Prophets. Gods word stand true. Read your Bible.... Many so called Christians will be lost. Be aware that Satan is real and only the strong, prayerful, and the faithful will survive. Christians everywhere start praying the DEVIL is a Liar we need to rebuke him in the name of Jesus. Let's not be deceived. If you believe Mrs. Baxter then you're saying the Holy Scripture is a lie. GOD'S WORD STANDS TRUE. Matthew 24:11... AND MANY FALSE PROPHETS WILL ARISE AND LEAD MANY ASTRAY."
4,HELL - IT'S REAL,"It is a privilege of God to be taken in the Spirit realm and be shown things, mysteries by God Himself - it is an honor. It is for the edification of the Body, so that truly you will know that which is real and that which is not. THIS IS REAL. This book offers a revelation of hell previously unknown, unrevealed. It should not be taken lightly nor judged as false. Jesus says ""He who has ears to hear, let him hear...."" Do you hear Him today? A MUST READ for believers and the lost alike - share it with those that you love."
4,A Divine Revelation of Hell,"A very graphic description of Hell as viewed in a dream state by the author hasDivine Revelation Of Heavena chilling effect. Describes a place no one wants to be, much less sentenced to for eternity!"
3,Once saved always saved?,"Does this woman believe that once you give your life to the Lord then you are always saved, or that if you fall away, then you will go to heaven? I believe that once saved always saved. If I mess up, and ask the lord's forgivness, then I am still going to be with him.. This book doesn't portray that!"
5,A. May,THIS BOOK WAS IN EXCELENT CONDITION... IT LOOKED BRAND NEW... IT ARRIVED ON TIME... I WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY... I WAS VERY PLEASED...
3,The Divine Revelation of Hell review,"Good book. Will make you think. There is a lot of repetition, a lot."
1,This book cannot possibly be for real!!,"This book is poorly written and unbeliveable! I believe in Heaven as well as Hell, but this books description of hell would cause even the Bible believing Christian to dismiss hell as a figment of someones demented imagination. Hell shaped like a body...people repenting in hell.....a ""Fun Center? Oh Pa-lease! Don't waste your time with this one."
4,Great Book,"I can't say I believe she was actually visited by Jesus but I can say that we shouldnt judge her and say she is lying. Who are we to say if her dreams were actually a visit from Jesus or not. If her goal in writing this book is to convince people there is a hell (and there IS Im sure) and she saves JUST ONE PERSON, then it did it's job, and it cant hurt to do the right thing in life.I enjoyed the book."
1,Deceitful Liar,"Mary Baxter should be thrown in prison for her major defamation of God's character and of Jesus Christ. I got so pissed off at her version God and Jesus by reading her garbage. I personally know that this is not the person God really is because I tend to be more of a universalists, but I have the greatest contempt and scorn for narrow minded hell driven bigots like Mary Baxter.And it further ticks me off to see that people actually had their Christian faith strengthened by reading this book. How can they rejoice when they think that 75% of this failed god foresaken is going to be tormented forever in hell. Tell me how in the HELL that strengthens their faith and makes them ""happy""? Praise Satan for evil people who call themselves Christians and actually enjoy this book. May they suffer in the afterlife!!"
1,Schizophrenia,"A better title for this book would be, ""Ramblings of a Schizophrenic Fundie"". How in the 'hell' could anyone believe this? This book was totally absurd in every way. Reading this book further proves that most christians are morons, and that they must use scare tactics in order to brainwarp people into following their dogma. What a waste!"
1,lets be more broadminded,"reading some of the other reviews of this book,you can already say that they have been brainwashed by this book and others like it.All of them pleading that 'it is true',all it takes is one book and the gullible will hang on to any belief you put into their minds.I think we have a choice,don't we,you can believe whatever you want,who knows what the truth is.Someone will say that i saw hell in a vision,so believe me and someone else will say that hell is a myth,and they have a right to say what they want.we are 'what we think',so remember that you have the power to choose what you believe in.so don't let somebody scare you by saying things like 'believe in hell and do so and so be4 it's too late',becoz quite honestly nobody can claim to be an authority on these subjects no matter how much they insist that they are right,so the word of a skeptic is just as good as the word of someone who has claimed to visit hell.Lets keep an open mind on the subject instead of taking stands."
1,Worse Than Bad,"This person tells a total and complete LIE. She says those who follow the Antichrist will look and walk like zombies, and that you can just go and visit the Antichrist anytime you want to ask him questions, and that everyone that follows the Antichrist must give him all their personal possessions. A world dictator with control of all the gold on Earth wants your personal goods? Where is he going to store the personal goods of several billion people? THIS BOOK IS A JOKE! TOTAL FICTION!"
2,No,"This book tells about the horrors of hell, which is supposed to incite the desire to share the gospel so people don't go to hell, but it makes the mistake of saying that people went to hell because they weren't good enough, or they escaped hell because they were good enough, and fails to show that we escape hell by grace and grace alone. No, this book fails to bring one to grace and could bring someone under condemnation who is actually saved."
5,Excellent read,"Excellent read, evokes much thought and internal debate. Well written. Easily read in a day, but makes you want to read again. Each time you read, you discover more and more."
1,It was gripping when I believed it,"After cleaning out my basement i came across this book again I got back in high school. I was once heard about it from somebody and i thought that i should give it a look-see. I gatta say it was very gripping and held my attention for a long time which is pretty good because I have ADD.But after reading it again i noticed that some of the things in the book you can't bring together with the bible. For example, she talks about how the spirits in the left leg of hell have rotting flesh falling from their bones. You can't possibly match that with Luke 24:39 where Jesus said ""See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.""You have your choice between Mary Baxter and Jesus. Make your choice."
3,"Good to scrare you, incorrect in a lot of places","This book is very good at literally scaring people out of hell. In that it calls people to salvation from a real place of death and suffering. However, being a Christian, and owning a Bible, it was not very far into the book that I realized that Ms. Baxter took passages out of context. Made statements that the Bible contraticts and I think that some of the errors that she made are key to winning people to Christ. I would not recommend this book to anyone that wants to know the truth. There is no true thing in this book about hell that is not in the Bible."
1,Discern the spirits of delusion in biblical knowledge!,"The reason that this book is totally false is due to two points.First, in this book the author inserted that in the past Jesus repeatedly had undertaken the death of cross and resurrection to save people. what a ridiculous! It's the most funny testimony I've ever read.The Bible proclamed that Jesus was crucified on the cross and risen from dead ""once and forever for our salvation."" I wondered whether or not she really had ever read the Bible entirely. I'm sure that demons used her for their show.Second, accordint to this book, believers may lost their salvation. Alas! It is very sad that Such a opinion will have influence on readers. Christians'salvation is forever because calling of God is irrecocable. If believers'salvation can be lost, it makes God imperfect.Don't purcase this book! Save your money!"
2,Christian Propaganda!,"Basically, there are two groups of people who go to hell: homosexuals and non-Christians. As one can see, this book reeks with evangelical, born-agian Christian claptrap. I give it two stars instead of one star because the book was very descriptive. Gee, the levels of hell in this book almost remind me of another book which describes hell in a similar manner. Try Dante's ""Inferno"" instead."
1,The worst Christian book ever written,"This tripe deserves not even a ""1"". A ""0"" would even be too nice. ""A Divine Revelation of Hell"" has only one salient use: kindling for a fireplace. Better yet, torch it in a bonfire.This garbage shouldn't even recieve a ""-5"". To use this book to scrub oil off a mechanic shop floor would be an insult to the oil AND the mechanic shop floor.It is obvious to even well-educated children that Baxter is mentally ill and a paranoid delusional scizophrenic. This is fear served up as faith, insanity served up as inspiration. Actually, I guess it COULD be used to line a gerbil cage. I guess the book DOES have another use.Now, Mary, just calm down and have a nice cup of cocoa and maybe some depressants. You need to calm down and actually study the Scriptures rather than believe what your mommy/daddy/preacherman taught you, ok? Shhhhh....it's OK, Mary. Shhhhhhhhhhh........"
2,"Unscriptural, repetitive, and possible confusing.","The main question the Gospel Book Club asked was ""Why?"" Why would Jesus have to take a person through what Mary K. Baxter went through when He has already given us His Word? Why would Mary K. be so tormented during the day, when it was Jesus, the Prince of Peace, who was supposedly giving her this revelation? Why was much of the book, and her 40-day tour, so repetitive? Why did she list the Scriptures at the end of the book, when it was at the end where she recommended that we read the Scriptures as we read the book? Examples of areas that we felt could not be verified with Scripture were the jail-like holding cells for some of the lost souls, Hell's shape as a body, and the babies' heaven.The Gospel Book Club believes this book could possibly confuse new Christians or those who are not sure of what they believe or how they believe it. While we didn't doubt that Ms. Baxter went through ""something,""we questioned the ""divinity"" of her revelation."
3,"In Response to J. Hagg ""Wholly His""","I don't think Satan would want you to know how bad hell is. Seriously doubt if he would help the author describe it and keep people away. Just a thought.I have been reading passages to my Sunday School class. Some may think it is a little heavy but considering the world we live in, it is just what young people need to think about."
2,boring,"I hate to say it, but this book was a huge disappointment to me. I always look forward to anything new from Ms. Small and I was excited to start reading this one. A few pages into it and I could tell that this was going to be a big yawn. I find myself actually skipping pages of the book just to reach the end. I hope that her next book can recapture some of the magic that was in her previous books."
4,Glad I found this series,"The Rosamond book is proving to be a great distraction. I'm excited there are more books in this series. The author does get a bit wordy at times, ie. continually telling Rosamond's life history, but the book overall is really enjoyable. A great escape."
3,Enjoyed this Book,"I enjoyed this book and I want to read the sequel to it. Reading this book makes me happy that I live in this day and age. That being said, Rosamund is an engaging character and I enjoyed her story very much, enough so that I want to find out what happens to her in the sequel, Until You."
5,Great Seller,Received very promptly and in great condition. Would order again from this seller. Shipped within two days from purchase.
4,Pretty Good!!,I have to say that this is probably the third book that I have read by Bertrice Small. I greatly enjoyed Skye O'Malley. This book was right up their with Skye O'Malley. Once again we have a strong willed heroine. She attracts the eyes of the King of England as well as a few other men in the novel. I enjoyed reading the history and couldn't wait to read what would happen next to Rosamund. I was also extremely happy with the character of her second husband. He saw her nasty uncle for what he was and helped shape Rosamund into the fiery determined lady that she became. BRAVO!!I also loved the character of her cousin Thomas Bolton. He added alot of humor to the book. The only thing that I grew tired of was the constant explanation of the food. I got tired of reading about capons and rabbit meat.I cannot wait to read the second installment in this new series.
2,A little better than her last few books,"This is still no Kadin or Skye O'Malley but at least this book is a little better than her last few. Same formula...young heiress finds true love, said true love dies, heiress goes to court shags a King, goes home takes a lover. The most exciting part of this book was the last few pages when the Scots man comes after Rosamund...but then you get put off until the next book...."
2,Tired out,"There is nothing new under the sun with Bertice Small. Maybe her sex scenes are a little less spicy than in her past work, but that's about it. This book is like a weak repeat of Bertice Small's past work.I really disliked the ending - I don't like the fact that there's going to be a sequel to ROSAMUND hitting me on the head! I presume Logan Hepburn will be the hero of the second installment, which is nice, but do I want to buy the second installment?? Not if it reads like this one."
3,Fun historical,"For fans of Bertrice Small, this is pretty typical of her stories. It portrays fairly realistically the kind of society existing during the time period. It's a must read for the sequel (Until You), which I thought was better. Small makes a few errors in her historical details, but most won't notice those. As always, she spins a tale that flows smoothly. Readers will meet some of the other Small characters as players in the story."
2,"Interesting, but not too spectacular","John William's lesser known score is interesting, but it doesn't have the same quality as some of his later compositions. His main title is wonderful, it seems almost like a homage to Bernard Hermann. For Gillian is also nice and playful. However, most of the other tracks are uneven. They simply don't contain any memorable material. Also, the music isn't all too scary, despite it being made for a horror/thriller. Some fans may also be turned off by some of the 70's synthesizer incorperations. I recommend that you see this movie to evaluate his score, before purchasing. You never know, it may be what you have been looking for!"
2,"Pleasant, but nothing remarkable","Fogelberg's first album was a commercial dud, despite the singer/songwriter genre being at its peak when it was released in 1972.The problem was simple. While the songs here are pleasant, there is nothing here remarkable enough to have stood out with the glut of west coast senstive singer/songwriters."
5,"Dan's Gone, But not forgotten","This life is merely a passage of time. While Dan Fogelberg was on this earth, He blessed millions of people through his music. Long will he be remembered as a thoughtful balladeer, a romantic troubadour, a passionate rocker, and just plain good folk.I will allways remember the way I felt when I first heard ""Home Free"". I was involved with my first romantic adventure, exploring the wonders of young love. For hours I would sit and listen to ""To the Morning"" and ""Stars"" and ""Wysteria"". It was a sweet time in my youth. A time that I will treasure untill my time on this earth passes also. I would be so happy to hear Dan singing inside when I reach Heavens gates. Can I but chance to dream?"
5,It took me back 30 years,"I had forgotten how much I loved this ""album"" Whoever wrote that it was up there with J.T., Cat Stevens John Denver and the like was spot on. It brings back so many wonderful memories, I will have to listen to his newer material and see if I like it. I know that its great music because my kids hate it!"
5,fogelberg,great music. totally enjoy the album. ordered and received this item in excellant time. completely pleased with the purchasing process...
3,Better Than Most of His Albums but Mediocre at Best,"This album is his first and might be his best album (along with Souvenirs and Nether Lands), but you can tell it is his first - sounding very forced and amateurish at times. There are no great songs here to be sure, but there are several good songs -- To the Morning, Stars, Be on Your Way, Looking for a Lady and a few really bad clunkers -- More Than Ever and Long Way Home (Live in the Country) are just terrible unlistenable garbage. Get Very Best Of instead."
2,Nice Pictures,To quote someone else's review... this book makes a good paperweight and has nice pictures. Also a waste of money.
4,The Bible for underwater gardeners!,"I have continuosly used this book and it has so far gave me much insight and joy over and over again. This book is undoubtly the best book on the topic of aquarium landscaping. However, it has a little weakness due to the translation from Japanese to English. The scientific name for certain plants and fishes are not universal or probably not existent at all. In addition, the author claim that the fishes he uses in some tank setups are native to Japan, but unfortunately it is not.... That's the weakness that I can identified so far. Other than that, it is of excellent quality in terms of photography and presentation."
5,morphine really wins you over with this one,"I don't know how he does it, but the bassist plays with such jangly, determined exuberance that it creeps into your muscles until your body is moving with him and loving every minute of it. Just tenor sax, wah bass, and vocals make up Morphine and it is a perfect recipe for solid towers of song. Turn this album up loud and you will be granted admission into a sinister, penetrating, aching world of music that is truly delicious. Mark Sandman plays the 2-string slide bass and sings with a haunting baritone voice that is smoky, sexy and dramatic. This guy is something very special. You'll see what I mean on ""Whisper"" and the last song, a thwarted-love ballad that sounds like a lovely lullaby, ""Gone for Good"" . And song seven, ""Super Sex"", is just dynamite. A very solid, ground-breaking album."
2,Good sax.,"Good sax, and ""Whisper"" is a gotta-have-it hit. Interestingly off-key, it's a limiting factor - good for a track or two, an entire album that way kind of grates. Despite that, they show great potential."
2,No,"Despite some good songs, like the dynamic opener ""Honey White"", the intriguing ""Radar"" or the well-crafted ""All Your Way"", this record is not very convincing or solid. Morphine have a style of their own, that`s undeniable, yet this release is too depressing, tiresome and unengaging. The peculiar use of sax in their songs is one of the band`s trademarks, still I think they overuse it and the result ends up being repetitive and forgettable. ""Yes"" combines indie rock, blues, lo-fi and jazz in a somewhat innovative way, Mark Sandman`s voice is interesting and strong and the band is professional, yet this album is average as a whole. The filler songs outweight the good moments, delivering an uneven record.Not the best around."
2,What am I missing,"After hearing the song ""Hanging on the Curtain,"" I decided to check out this band that I had never heard of. What a mistake. I really wanted to love this cd but I just couldn't get into it. I have to admit that I'm not much of a blues fan so maybe that's why but I really don't see how so many can think this cd is so good. Anyone interested in buying this cd can contact me because believe me I wouldn't think it was much of a loss."
5,Yes,"Generally underappreciated by fans, ""Yes"" remains one of the more enigmatic additions to Morphine's catalog. It's really no surprise that the album's experimental sound didn't win over listeners who first became addicted to the band's more accessible albums, ""Cure for Pain"" and ""Good."" But the elements that make those albums great are all apparent: bass, drums, sax, and that voice. Here, Sandman doesn't sing so much as speak to us, weaving wry lyrics and low rock into spare and breathtaking gems like ""Yes"" and ""The Jury."" It may not be the easiest listen, but in the end, this unique work is as rewarding as anything else created by these exceptional musicians."
5,Roses In the Woods Review,I thought it was a very good book. It was very intriguing and full of suspense. I would highly recommend this book to avid readers.
2,Disintegrated after 2 minutes,Used this blade with my Crain Supersaw 810 and the blade disintegrated shortly after starting. I was trying to under cut the brick hearth of a fireplace.
4,This is NOT a Gay themed movie,"I don't know why this movie has been categorized as GLBT-interest movie. There is no gay plot or character in it whatsoever!Apart that...It's a pretty sweet movie (""dramedy"") with likable characters, charm, fun ideas about a middle class family in Australia.Generally we enjoyed it despite having expected something completely different (like that cute father would start fooling around with another good looking 'aussie bum"" :)"
3,Okay movie for a lazy day,"The movie was okay - At least there was a decent story line, and did not candy coat life as most movie do."
3,One-sided,"This book is interesting, but it has two main faults: in addition to being out-of-date, it offers a very rosy, one-sided view of Jerry Brown, as evidenced by its very subtitle, ""the Philosopher Prince."" Have you ever heard of a philosopher prince who throws a childish temper tantrum, screaming and cursing for many minutes, merely because his telephone bill is unusually high? What about a philosopher prince who mooches half-eaten sandwiches from his secretaries in order to save himself the cost of buying his own lunch? Or a philosopher prince who privately derides Vietnam vets as ""trained killers""? I worked in Jerry's Oakland office in 1994 and '95, back when he was hosting his radio show, so I know whereof I speak; let's just say that I'm a little cynical when I read effusive praise of Jerry Brown."
2,Looked better on line,"Not thrilled at all with these. One of the MOP discs was put on backwards and it is very obvious to me - one is shinier and has more ""depth"" to it than the other one. I gave them to my niece - she is 13 and imperfections like that don't bother her at this point in her life. She is happy with them."
3,"Funk bass, heavy metal guitar, industrial beats","Bootsy Collins (Bassist supreme for James Brown, Pairlament and later for himself) provides some funky bass lines, add heavy metal style guitar, industrial beats, wierd vocal samples, vocal effects (robotic voices), a bit of ambient and a large dash of Bootsy's general wierdness and you've got an interesting mix."
5,Exccelent,"We have these at work. They are fantastic. I am a big guy at over 400 lbs and sit confidently and comfortably in this chair, it just isn't going to break. A great buy."
4,"Some good, a little bad.","The chairs are as advertised. They have a nice big comfortable seat and seem sturdy. Maybe they will last a lifetime.On the bad side, you're supposed to be able to use them outside. I am using one to sit on while I moderate my dogs' eating since they get snippy if I don't supervise. I notice the seats are getting stained from the rain, etc. I have not scrubbed them but I'm pretty sure some of it is not coming out. But what I find most troubling is ants. Apparently there are small openings in the seat and an ant colony has taken up residence. They use the seat as their patio and the inside as their colony home. So inside the seat is probably all kinds of ant debris. I wish there were no holes in the plastic that allowed this. That is my only problem with this product."
2,Lasted only a few months,"Despite looking very sturdy and that it was called ""lifetime"", my chair only lasted a few months before the plastic seat cracked.I'm not exceptionally heavy either, though I did use it several hours a day.As to comfort, I wasn't particularly thrilled anyway as my hip kept bumping into the framing on the sides."
2,would like more info,"Unable to track the manufacturer of this item. Would be interested in purchasing this item, w/o a logo, as a possible soccer booster club fund raiser item. Can you refer me to someone that can assist........ThanksBobbie at: prost@cox.net"
4,For big band lovers,"Big Band jazz is a gas. A symphony...of Jazz. At the risk of overlookin' a few others...If you dig Kenton, Herman, Rich, Basie....You can add Hollman. Real hip voicings."
5,pumps,I got this as replacement pump for one that has worked for 5 yrs everyday around 12hr's a day. Flawless operation
4,perfect? No....still great? Yes,"Most people will compare this with the fabulous box sets I and II, unfortunately. This set doesn't have quite the sparkle of the first two, but is still great. I think Rhino should be complimented, but derided, for trying something a little different in this third offering. Regarding Disc 3 (entertainment figures' picks), the intriguing liner notes put their choices into good perspective. It seems Disc 4 (""modern"" doo wop) offends a lot of people, but I think it's a fun disc. It clearly shows doo wop's pervasive influence on pop music. And it's obvious the modern groups are performing with love for the genre, and not in comic parody. A solid B+ , warranting any doo wop fan's purchase."
2,Rhino falls down on Doo Wop III,One of the worse selections of Doo Wop I have purchased. The first two CDs are good and keeping with the high standards of Rhino. But the third and fourth CDs are just not there. The Celebrities (3rd CD) must not be listening to the same good Doo Wop that I enjoy. The fourth CD is nothing to rave about. Some of the artist come close...but most are not there! So much good Dop Wop music out there that could have been placed in this collection. A real disappointment!
2,disappointed!,"I waited forty years for something like Doo-Wop Box Set and Box Set II. I bought both and was thrilled with both. Box Set III leaves something to be desired. They could've quit with discs 1 & 2, better luck next time with Box Set IV........keep it pure!"
3,3 Clean closets and 1 dirty trick!,"I wish that I could give this collection more stars. Boxes 1 and 2 were incredible, but it sounds like Rhino is really scraping the bottom of the barrel here. Discs 1 and 2 are decent, 3 other than repeating a couple of songs available on the first 2 boxes (hello people! who is your target buyer? people who already own boxes 1 and 2 perhaps?....duh). Disc 4 was a remarkale misstep, taking Doo Wop out of the 'classic' venue and transporting it into the 'modern' age. It's nothing short of a small miracle that the majority of songs do pull it off (yes it is THAT ""Whole Lotta Love"" and THAT ""Eye of the Tiger"" in Doo Wop format). Still, for the price of this box set, getting songs that I already had owned (regardless of the star's picks) and a whole cd of 'interpretations' of Doo Wop standards was a sad affair and Rhino is a better lable than to pull this on a listener. You got me this time... if there is a Doo Wop Box 4 (and I doubt it) please don't trick me again."
3,Looking For An Echo!,"Ah yes!...The era when four or five guys could be harmonizing on a streetcorner one day; in a recording studio the next, and a week later hear Alan Freed play their record on WINS...This third Rhino box set doesn't hold a doo wop candle to the first two, but it has enough to reccomend it....Examples: At long last ""Here I Am Brokenhearted"" by the Four Jays on CD......a sensational ""Sheik Of Araby"" by the Colts, and the amazingly beautiful ""Mio Amore"" by the Flamingos...The fourth disc of ""Neo-Doo Wop may offend some purists, but who cares???Most of the doo wop purists I know are pain in the a-- bores...Besides this is doo wop, not Mozart....Next time around Rhino don't forget ""Fat Fat Fat Momeo"" by the Chalets!"
2,The Weakest Link In The Chain,"Doo Wop Box #3 has its moments - there are many really good tunes on it - but it falls far short of the first two sets, which were excellent. Disc 3 contains a couple of tunes that were featured in the first 2 sets but otherwise has some really scarce tunes. Disc 4 in this set is a complete waste of time and is suitable for use as a frisbee or coaster. Rhino really dropped the ball with this set. Buy the other two sets before investing in this."
3,The Weakest Link Of The Three,"This set was a disappointment after the first two. I just didn't think that the set was put together that well. Many of the songs were picked by opinions that Doo Wop ""experts"" said needed to be in a box. It has its moments, but overall is not as strong as the first two. Make sure you get them before this one. This is definately a set to finish the collection from Rhino. Once again, the sound is great, as Rhino products are always top sounding (at least the ones I own)."
1,Where are the Girls?,I've never heard any of the cd's but I think that it was poor consideration to exclude the girl groups from this set.
4,Great gift,"This was one of the many presents I bought for my mom this Christmas and it was her favorite! She loved it and so did her students when she showed it at school. I, on the other hand, while I liked it, wasn't 100% convinced by all the arguments - I'm not sure if they're up to date. One section basically consisted of a whole bunch of case studies, and I didn't find it too credible. As for the rest of it, though, fantastic, has really opened my mind on the bottled water industry. I bought myself a reuseable to go mug right after I watched this and plan on using it everywhere!"
5,Never Using Plastic Again,"For years I have known the damage that plastic does to our bodies and the environment, but it never really hit home until after watching this film. While I didn't agree on some parts (some of the people that were interviewed seemed kind of sketchy), the main message was great.I haven't bought a bottle of water in a while, but I sure not buying one ever again."
5,Tapped Up,"Saw this at a film festival and immediately bought it. It changed my life. I have not purchased or drunk out of a plastic water bottle since.The movie covers the subject more thoroughly than others--from who is stealing our water to the quality and safety of the water we are BUYING in plastic bottles, and the pollution. I showed it to the local high school and they removed their water bottle vending machines. I have ordered 2 more to pass around to friends. Well worth a watch."
1,Very Disappointing!,"I debated whether or not to review this album because after all it's just a CD, but if you don't have extra cash - go for something else. I love Chris Isaak's music, but this album has non of the qualitites that make him special. His covers of Christmas standards are lifeless with none of the guitar playing or vocalese that he's known for. On the few songs where he does incorporate the pathos he's know for, he quickly crosses the line between singing the blues and singing dirges. If you want something that truely celebrates Christmas, try Brian Setzer. You cannot go wrong with a rockabilly renditionof the Nutcracker!"
5,200 Stars at least,His music is totally wonderful. I have all of his CD's this one is one of the best. I listen to Christmas music all year round. This is a buy buy buy you will not be disappointed. Try the Best of too.
4,Chris' velvet voice rings in the holidays,"If you know Chris Isaak, you know what to expect. His senseof humor, as well as his seductive voice, make this an enjoyable holiday album. My favorite track, and perhaps a reason in itself to buy this album, is ""Last Month Of The Year,"" a rockabilly tune that perks me up every time it comes up in my holiday music shuffle. ""Mele Kalikimaka"" is another great not-so-standard holiday tune, to accompany the many classics he covers on this CD. If you're looking for something with a little zing, but not too far out of the standard holiday music genre, than this CD is for you. Happy Holidays!"
5,Very pleased with my purchase,I was looking forward to this album and am very pleased with my purchase. Some great old Christmas tunes and a few good new ones written by this artist. Any Chris Isaak fan will like this Christmas album. This IS a very smooth and cool album.
5,Merry Christmas,If you like Chris you will love this CD. I love coming home from work and hearing it play as I open the door as my husband really likes Isaak.
4,Aptly titled,A great collection of Christmas songs done in the key of Chris Isaak. The originals are appealing as well.
3,Details Of PANTERA,"this cd will tell you all about pantera , how they started it all and every other thing... the recording was not so good......"
5,Quick Trip to Nirvana,"I've used many different meditation soundtracks, and this one stands the test of time (over 10 years) as one of my all time favorites. I've owned a copies of this soundtrack for over a decade and still listen to it very regularly. I find it soothing and reliably effective. A nice, quick, fast trip into theta entrancement. Works for me!"
1,Don't waste your money,"If this was a High School project, it would rate a ""C"". Many misleading statements and incorrect facts. It's my opinion this book isn't worth the paper it was written on."
5,fantastic --been looking for this for years,"This movie has always been one of my favorites! The cameo roles are fantastic. Where else do Peter Sellers, Orson Wells and Ursula Andrews appear in the same place? This music makes me want to light the candles and pop the wine."
5,One of the best 60's soundtracks,Casino Royale is full of fun and well recorded music. The sonic quality of Dusty Springfield's vocal on The Look of Love is worth the price of the disk.
4,Fun Soundtrack Album,It's Burt Bacharach and Herb Albert! Good quality recording. Gave it a 4 ONLY because was VERY disappointed that did not include the ending credits song with singing. Had to down load that song separately from iTunes. I'd say the album is worth the $14.99 paid. Maybe worth the $30.00 some are selling it it for IF you have the massively disposable income. IN no way is it worth the $50.00 to $99.00 I saw also offered. UNLESS you have a family member dying and their final wish is to listen to that album just one...last...time. In that case and only that case is it worth the higher price. Fun to play at at party bounce house for kids.
4,"not revolutionary, but very nice","OK, it doesn't break any new ground. OK, you may not need this to make your cd collection more complete or coherent. But why should yuo care? If you can have this music and listen to talented people with a taste for nostalgia and harmony, why don't you? I can stand to the Jayhawks and Wilco (the other bands I do not know) and it's great fun to listen to. Buy it and warm your heart."
4,New Artist Worth Buying !,"I found Liquid Logic to be a refreshing new band. It has tracks that have good rythm with a somewhat heavy sound. I found them to be a little bit like the ""Jimmie's Chicken Shack"" band, but Liquid Logic's lyrics are based on more serious subjects. I think they are a promosing new band worth listening to."
2,good music--CDRom doesn't play,"As a fan of early PF (pre-Dark Side, and most definitely, pre-The Wall), I was excited to find this CD/CD-Rom. The music was great -- a nice illustration of the talents of Sid Barrett before illness derailed his career. However, the CD-Rom has no way to start without a command to download QuickTime 3.0. I already had a more advanced version, but had no choice but to download 3.0. After restarting the CD-Rom, I simply got another message to download QuickTime 3.0, with no way to play the CD-Rom. I feel I got half of what I paid for with this offering."
1,Didn't last long,"I wouldn't buy this tee if you have an older child or a heavy swinger. My daughter (14 yrs)used this for about two weeks for softball practice. The top of the tee that holds the ball cracked and eventually fell off. We have been using the remaining part of the tube to support the ball after I trimmed it with a knife and supported it with some heavy duty duct tape. I'll have to purchase a new one soon. The return on this item is such that it will cost me to return it and I don't want a replacement. Overall the tee appeared to be a good design, the base is well weighted, but the rubber just isn't durable. If you have a small child just starting out this might be ok, but I think I'd try another product."
3,good product but,the top piece that hold the ball has little plastic spikes that over time fall off it they are hit with the bat... other than that its a quality tee with some weight to it... the only other thing is open it and leave it outside because the rubber smell is so overpowering that my room smelled like it for 3 days after i took it outside
5,Most Romantic Movie Ever!,"This movie is simply the sweetest, truest look at young, pure love I have ever seen on film. Zhang Ziyi shines as Di, the smitten young maiden who's fallen for the new school teacher in the villiage. What develops between them, shown through her eyes, is simply captivating. And the underlying story about the son wishing to fulfill his mother's difficult request is moving, especially when it all comes together.I adore this movie and can't wait to watch it again and again!"
5,More than five stars!,"This movie is phenominal and haunting. It is ""G"" rated which is rare. This movie made me feel like I walked into a portrait. I've never seen a film in which there is very little dialogue and yet it said volumes! Don't bother renting, just buy it."
4,A Good Foreign Movie But...,I especially liked the movie for it's music. It's dissapointing that there isn't a soundtrack available! Does anyone know where I can possibly find it?
5,a great film,"There are some movies that are just great films! My wife and I almost turned it off as it starts out in black and white and because it is hard to know where it is going but hang in there. Like the wizard of oz, it picks up when it turns to color. It is one of the most heartfelt films we have ever seen. Not sappy at all, but will pull at your heartstrings. Simple in it's entirety, even the expressions on this fine actress capture deep emotion. This is a great film to see, and will become a favorite. No kung fu, or ""action"" but captures the essence of the heart. A 10! well done. unlike a lot of american films which are so 'visually stimulating', this takes the time to develop the charectors and emotions."
5,One of my favorite movies...,This movie is so touching. I loved the determination of the girl. It's been a while since I've seen this movie so forgive me for not remembering the characters' names. My children got hooked on foreign films after watching this movie with me. A great family movie or just a clean chick flick!
4,A story of simpler times-,"Nice movie--excellent scenery!Luo Yushengs father has died--and he returns home for the first time in years to attend the funeral--which his mother wants to be traditional. The meeting of his parents then becomes the focal point of the story, as it is recounted! Romantic, without hollywoods prerequisite make out scenes--this is a fine story for all ages. From a broken bowl to a lost hairpin to Luo's young mother waiting in the snow for his fathers return--this is a very moving story--of simpler lives and simpler times.Interesting variation-the current scenes are in black and white--but the recollections of days gone by are in color!Audio is mandarin with a choice of dubbed French--and English subtitles."
4,Simple love story,"The Road Home is one of the most simple and tender love story I ever seen. It's noticeable the simplicity of the anecdote, the short dialogues and characterization, but overall very effective movie. Ziyi Zhang is lovely in her character as a very young woman that falls in love at first sight. Obviously one can't judge the social circumstances with occidental eyes. The atmosphere, and the values surround the feelings and actions are of the rural China, with long and strong traditions, sometimes in conflict with the communist view. I recommend it."
5,Amazing,"Yesturday I went and saw this movie at the international theater at my school. When I realized it was about to be over I started seriously getting sad, I figured I wouldn't ever have the chance to see it again. It is just one of thoses movies that is so innocent and sweet, it grabs your heart. It had the whole audience laughing several times, but it was also so unbelievable how tough the girl is. I love it and would recomend it to anyone."
5,THE ROAD HOME,This dvd is excellent. The subtitles take nothing from the beautiful cinematogrophy. The subtle nuances leave the viewers imagination the pleasure of wondering what this beautiful woman is thinking and feeling as she yearns for her true love. Zhang is brilliant and genuine. This was a joy to watch and a fond memory to hold. A pleasure.
5,fabulous movie,"Why can Hollywood make wonderful movies like ""The Road Home"" It is a beautiful, moving love story, goes back and for between the past and the present. The past is in black & white and the present in technicolor. I highly recommend this movie"
2,Boring,It is always nice to see an innocent romance without any sex involved. But this movie is plain boring. Throughout the whole movie Ziyi's character is running through the woods chasing the boy. It is unclear why they even fell in love with each other. I gave it 2 stars for excellent scenery.
2,where's the love?,"Although I applaud the fact that Zhang Yi-mou can portray a love story without reverting back to sexual escapades, this moving is just plain boring! When you are watching it it takes forever and there is also this 30 min. snooze of an intro he takes explaining the background for the lovestory between his parents. Goodness gracious do something! Zhang zi-yi does a great job of prancing about in her pigtails, but I too am flabbergasted as to how his parents ever fell in love. Unbelievably, they said like two words to each other before deciding they loved each other. i dont call that a great love story, I call it a 3rd grade lunch recess fling."
1,overrated,"This is overrated. They said the movie was breathtaking in simplicity. Yeah it was simple...There was nothing going on in the movie....Ziyi runs around the movie with ponytails...thats it!!!! what the hell kind of movie is this???? the only reason its here is the success of crouching tiger, hidden dragon...and after all that happens with nothing going on, the ending is a letdown as well.....lousy!!!!"
1,EXTREMELY SLOW AND BORING!,What a tedious movie to watch. Do not see this film. It'll make you fall asleep.
3,nothing special,"meh.it's good but nothing epic.i got it cause it was cheap and i dig most stuff on the black arc label.the raps,music,etc didn't blow me away but it's a fun disc to pop in from time-to-time."
5,Great Buy!,"The belt arrived earlier than expected and was an easy 5 min. replacement. My mother has owned several bread machines and they all went out,so every 6 months to a year she was replacing them. This bread-machine was very good and so she asked me to fix the problem.I found out it was the belt (as probably the problem was with the others). Fixing the belt was silly so I went online and found this belt. MY mum has been using the bread-machine for a while now and has had no problem.Also saved a good amount of money in not having to go out and purchase a new bread-machine.Would definitely purchase again."
1,It doesn't fit the Sunbeam!,"I'm upset about the fact they have the belt labeled for the Sunbeam and it's NOT, it''s much to large and drops off. Buyer beware this belt will be a waste of money if you punches it for your Sunbeam Breadmaker Model 5891!"
1,It is not working for the model 5981,"The comment under Product Features""Fits models 4807, 4810, 4811, 4812, 4832, 4833, 4839, 5811, etc.""ETC is not quiet accurate.Lost 11 dollar and have to order another one somewhere else."
1,Wrong belt,"I order the belt to repair a breadmaker but eneded up with a belt that was too long. Since you don't sell tha correct size and Sunbeam refuses to make it for that sunbeam model, I'm stuck with my purchase"
5,Filled in a lot of blanks!,"The power of the Bible is such that sometimes one forgets that the stories therein take place in a real world full of interesting living people like the Egyptians, Canaanites, Moabites, Assyrians, Romans, etc. and of course the Israelites. This book sheds a lot of light on the various places and peoples of Bible times and how archaeologists and other scholars have attempted to further our knowledge. As can be expected, there are often disagreements amongst the experts, and the author usually takes a refreshingly neutral stance in presenting different viewpoints. I especially appreciated the historical background information on the likes of the Babylonians, Persians, etc. and the parts dealing with daily life amongst the Israelites were interesting and informative. (And I never knew the Philistines were so sophisticated!) I highly recommend this book as a very good introduction to the Biblical world!"
4,Adorable!,We got this for our 8 month old daughter and he is so cute! A little smaller than we thought but adorable. His feet and butt are filled with beans so he has a little weight to him. Very cute and huggable.
5,Good fun and so soft,My son loves this plush toy. It is so soft and very hug-gable. It arrived even sooner than expected. I do like the Gund Sesame street dolls better because I think they look closer to the actual characters than others.
5,So cute,This was a gift. But he's the perfect size for an adult who loves Ernie. He sits on her dashboard of her car & is always smiling.
5,zoe doll,"zoe ballerina doll is the cutest ever, my new granddaughter named zoe , born on 12/31/12...is a big fan of her new best friend"
5,daughter loved it for months,my 1yr old loved it for months and carried it every where. She still pulls it out sometimes now at 2yrs old.
4,Great Gift,"Purchased this as a gift and having just seen it a year later it has held up great, still looks like new. It looks exactly like the picture on the site shows; 14"" is a pretty big stuffed animal though so just be sure to realize it is bigger than most."
3,Zoe Gund 12 inch Ballerina,"It will work for a nursery decoration but the cost isn't worth the item.The actual purchase, shipping and ordering was very good, no problems."
5,"Gund Sesame Street Cookie Monster, Big Bird and Elmo","I bought these soft durable animals for my granddaughter. She's almost 2 and carries them with her everywhere. There are no hard parts on the animals except the eyes and they are exactly the right size for her arms. She loves the adorable animals. Everytime we watch Sesame Street, listen to a Sesame Street CD or go to the grocery store Big Bird is with us."
4,"What I expected, Satisfied.","Nice shiny soft and blue about 1 foot long from eyes to feet. Eyes are made of hard plastic and some wiring can be felt lining the mouth under the fur but not overly so. For some he may be a bit small, but for the person I made this a gift was perfect. Only thing is the Gund fur like other Gund bears is prone to changing from soft, shiny and pretty to becoming worn-looking, matted, and dull rather quickly even if cleaned. But no matter because it still looks cute and cuddly even still. This stuffed animal is what I expected from the description. I am a satisfied customer."
3,Well made but pricey.,"Well made and durable but not very ""cuddly"" and it was pricey. Get it if you like but don't expect it to be your child's favorite."
4,Good but not soft,"I bought Ernie for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She is a huge sesame street fan and I already had the Gund Elmo, who we were very pleased with on the quality. I have to say I was a little dissapointed with Ernie. He's not as soft as Elmo and seems more like hugging a canvas material. All in all, my daughter is happy, so that is what's most important."
5,Super soft and cute!,"My daughter is 2 and she LOVES Sesame Street - especially Elmo, Abby and Zoe. This plush is SO soft and Zoe's ballerina outfit is very cute and detailed. Perfect for your little Sesame Street lover!"
4,Cathy,I initially bought the Count for my grandaughter who is 18 months old. She watches Sesame Street and could recognize The Count. We had lots of fun playing with him - so much that I ordered another one for my grandson who is almost 8 months old. The doll is well made and fun!
3,cute but not cuddly,"This big bird is well made, but the beak is rather hard so it is not super cuddly. The rest of it is soft, but when you hug it, the beak pokes you. My kids prefer the elmo made by gund better, but it could be because they like elmo better too."
4,"Wesley chapel, fl","Good quality, no complaints. Appears as it does in real life. As any stuffed toy, kind of just sits in the room and is not played with much, but does enjoy it when I bring it out."
5,Zoe...,I purchased this from Amazon after searching in Australia and the price including shipping being better value than anything here. My baby Zoe loves here Zoe!
4,A Great Gift,"A perfect likeness! Cudley, cute, reasonably durable, always cheerful, just big enough. Glad I bought it. The young lady I gave it to treasures it. It has a face that is so lovable it makes it irresistible."
4,Dear Ernie and Big Bird,"Ernie and Big Bird was purchased as a gift for my grandson for Christmas. He is a month old, but I am sure he willenjoy playing with them since, they are so lovable. Perfect size for a young child. Great serviceand shipped quickly. Would order from them again."
1,Item is only 9 inches tall.,"This Oscar the Grouch by Gund is only 9"" tall, not 12 inches as indicated in the product description. Very disappointed, we had ordered it to use with some other puppets and it is the wrong scale so back it goes."
3,Mediocre,Count looks almost the same as the one that you would get from the Sesame Place in PA except its a lot cheaper there. The plush is also a little smaller than what i expected.
2,oscar the grouch,"I love Oscar the Grouch -- He is a nice looking one, but he doesn't talk, but it's ok. My grandson loves him!"
2,"nice product, poor delivery","This product was just what I was looking for: it's a friendly looking Big Bird, good size, and soft and plush. The problem is that it arrived from Bealls,(which I had never used before), DIRTY! It took a while to arrive, also. I won't use Bealls again."
3,Great quality but I question the choice,"Sesame street is big at our house and these are by far the best sesame street dolls I've seen but I am beginning to think that too many toys are not a good idea. They were played with for a few months then that was it. I was brought up to believe if you have trouble valuing your things you have trouble valuing people. Plus I bought these because Gund is American, well it was manufactured in China. With all the environmental concerns and the muliple toy recalls I am beginning to think I will use my buying power as a consumer to go sweatshop free by using freetrade Waldorf school type toys made in America (so hopefully it will boost the economy too). Less of them too."
3,Cute but not for kids that are rough on toys!,We got this for my daughter's first birthday since she loves Cookie. She was in a phase where she sort of beat her toys on the ground alot and she broke his eyes. We still have him a year later but he's put away until she's old enough I don't have to worry about her eating his eye if it falls off again (the front half of one eye came off but we superglued it back) I normally love these dolls but if your kid is in that experimenting phase where they like to drop or hit toys on things wait to get him.
4,Soft Cookie Monster,I bought this toy for my little cousin and she loves it. The Cookie Monster is extremely vibrant and soft. She sleeps with it every night and cuddles it wherever she goes. The education value of this toy would be great if it were to be played with while watching a Sesame Street episode. I recommend it for all ages!
1,The Count,My granddaughter who watches the count on a DVD carried The Count around for days after I gave it to her.
5,cooookie,"for the price, I was surprised at how durable and well made it is. Gundy has always been a good choice in soft stuffed friends."
3,Snuffwhatever,The toy is small it looks like its going to fall apart but my neice loves that thing. I bet its cute in the whole set though.
3,Christmas Present,Giving this to my grandson for Christmas and he hasn't seen it yet but Iknow he will love because he loves Sesame Street
5,We love Ernie!,"So cute and well made, he is the perfect size for our 2 year old granddaughter to haul around. He's small enough that I don't mind throwing him in my purse when she is done. Adorable!"
3,better value than most plushes,"Big Bird looks like the Big Bird we grew up with. he has soft ""feathers"" and a firm beak like you would expect. overall though, he doesn't strike me as very cuddly, the hard beak or something. the cost (in the low teens) is pretty good compared to other similar plushes. it seems to me Big Bird doesn't get much air time anymore which may be reflected in the price of the different plushes with the abby plush being more expensive.however, our experience was disappointing; our kids (2 year old girl and 3 year old boy) did nothing with the doll. it sits in a basket with a dozen other unused dolls/teddy bears (which says something, right?).of course, our experience may be quite different from yours. compared to other plush dolls, most more expensive and others a bit cheaper, i'd say it was a reasonable experiment although it didn't work out for us."
1,Sheds her hair,"When I received this toy I was firstly disappointed at how small and cheaply made it looked. It reminded me of the consolation prizes you win a the fair. I than noticed that her orange hair had rubbed off on my shirt, thinking it was just a few loose fibers I shook it to rid it of anymore, unfortunately that lead to a cloud of orange fuzz everywhere. I don't recommend this toy."
5,Soft and cuddly,This toy is so soft and cute. My son loves to give Cookie Monster a hug. Perfect addition for any little one who loves Sesame Street.
4,Good buy,This is a Great size for toddlers. Soft and good likeness of Oscar. Well worth the purchase and good price.
2,Cookie Monster stuffed muppet,"The Cookie Monster stuffed muppet was poorly shaped, sewn and made, very small and unrealistic compared to the real Cookie Monster toys. I cant imagine what the stuffing was made of."
4,A good value,Do you have a big bird lover? I had been looking for a plush that was larger than a bean bag... And finally found it on here! Super soft other than the beak... Our little one loves it.
5,Who doesn't love Big Brid?,"Of all the toys I got my 2 year old for Christmas, this was his favorite. Very soft and fuzzy for cuddling. Who doesn't love Big Bird?"
2,Couldn't stand the loving,"I bought this present for my Sesame Street fan for her 2nd birthday. It was love at first sight. She can't say Zoe so she calls her ""Baby"". She refuses to go to bed without her and insists on bringing her to the babysitter most days. However, after just a few weeks, Zoe started to get a little sad looking. The fabric on her legs started to get little ""pills"" on them and threads were starting to stick out of her shirt. Finally in November, after just 2 1/2 months, her little bottom busted open and her insides came spilling out leaving little beads everywhere. I went ahead and got her a new one because she loves it so much but if this one falls apart, I don't know. If you have a Sesame street fan, I'd buy the Abby Cadabby doll instead. My girls are twins and have treated their Abby and Zoe dolls equally. Abby still looks great. The fabric used for her body is much better. Plus, Abby is alot easier to say!"
2,seam opened up,"I bought three of these, Cookie Monster, Elmo and Big Bird... but I'm only unsatisfied with this one because the seam opened up in the back and it wasn't played with... it was just for the bed..."
4,Nice Collection,"Overall this is a good 60's oldies collection with good sound for a 1994 release. Exceptions: ""Quarter to Three"" always had bad sound, and ""Kicks"" sounds really horrible."
3,Well written but the plot is weak,"This was the first and only book I have read by Womack and it did not impress me very much. The characters and dialogue were well done but the plot is very weak and overly simplistic. The solution to the case just falls right into the detective's hands without him having to figure anything out. All in all, somewhat of a disappointment."
5,Love that Orange,"Received watch 2 weeks earlier than promised, of course the promise date gave them a month! So basically it was less than 2 weeks. the watch is as perfect looking in person as in the closeups online. The outer dial ratchets firmly and accurately. It is rich looking and has the expensive heft you would expect in any watch over $100. I am very pleased with the looks and quality."
5,Works amazingly!,"The Matrix Sleek Look line is by far the best line I've ever used. I mainly use the shampoo & conditioner. It will work for anyone, but especially if you have curly hair prone to frizz, like mine, you want to try it. I worked in a beauty supply store for a while so I've tried it all, and have not found any store level or salon level product that compares. Especially good for color treated hair to help moisturize. Expensive but worth every penny (you can even just buy the conditioner and use your normal shampoo and it will still help your hair.) I love it!"
4,Love this stuff!,I have very long hair past my booty. It's not real straight and can look puffy and fly away sometimes. This conditioner makes my hair very smooth and shiny. So smooth that it can be tricky trying to put it up in clips that doesn't slide out of my hair. I highly recommend this conditioner if you are needing something that smooths out your hair. Smells nice too :)
3,"Thanks, I'm really pleased.","Thanks, I'm really pleased. good product! you're really responsible. I recommend you 100% percent.Thanks, I'm really pleased. good product! you're really responsible. I recommend you 100% percent."
3,Theyre tshirts...,"They're shirts. They cover my torso. They separate my uniform shirts from my sweaty armpits so I don't have to wash and re-iron my uniform every day. They run a little larger than I expected though, so keep that in mind."
2,OK V-Neck T-Shirts,"I will be brief.They feel good, they fit well,but the price has gone up and I am not sure it isstill a good value."
4,Comfortable and reasonably priced undershirt,"Other than being just a tad shorter than I would like (I am 6'3 and long-waisted) these are excellent shirts. No obvious defects in the cloth or assembly, they wash well, are soft against the skin and for anybody of a more nornal height, plenty long enough to stay tucked in.Compared to a major discount chain's store brand, of roughly the same price, these are an order of magnitude better. The one's from ***-mart are so short I suspect only someone 5'6 would consider them useful. I ended up throwing out an entire pack of those when I got these, wife said they were not even suited for use as rags."
2,Length is not generous,"I bought these because one reviewer said he was tall and the shirts were good and long. I'm only 5'11"" and after one washing they shrank up and won't tuck in good. I'm long waisted, so the shirts will probably be fine for normal guys that aren't tall. The package also says generous length but they seem no longer than Hanes or other regular T-shirts."
2,so-so for me,"These undershirts are warm and comfy inside. However, I did not like that they shrink after washing a bit. Also, when I wear the undershirts, the v-neck always show up under any shirt or T-shirt that I wear. This was the main reason I bought the v-neck style, so that I can wear those undershirts under the T-shirt without showing that I wear them!!!"
2,Very coarse t-shorts,"I am not happy with the quality of the t-shirts. I won't have bought theseif I had touched and felt them at a real store. They are really coarse, bit soft cotton.I actually fell for the 2-for-1 kind of promotion and bought 4 packs for the price of 2 thinking they will last me long. But I am sorry to state that I will be returning them right away t oAmazon :(I am very sad..."
1,Bad Fit,I'm a really skinny person so I bought the tee's in a small and to my shock and dismay they hang off me... They're really comfortable but apparently I need an extra small or else I can't really wear them with anything and I definitely can't use them as an under shirt.
2,Not overly impressed,"When they arrived, I thought they looked like a Ladies Blouse as the V was very big. Larger than I expected. Didn't really notice the shrinkage as my wife washes with cold water and no dryer. We live in the Caribbean, so I didn't purchase them to be used as an undershirt. Two layers equals too hot. But the quality is lacking to be worn as a Tee. Expected better from a company like FOTL."
1,Poor format kills this Kindle version,A lack of line breaks makes this nearly unreadable unless one is already very familiar with the work. The free Kindle version should be withdrawn until this flaw is fixed.
1,"Lack of formatting ruins this, avoid",Unfortunately all lines run together making the poetry unreadable. This is one of the Kindle's many freebie failures. Avoid the free version.
1,"Doesn't fit 350z, leaves nice scratches.","Saris website states that this ""fits"" a Nissan 350Z if you use the hatch huggers, I ordered both. It did not fit well enough for me to even think about using it for more then 10 miles. Don't waste your money. It also leaves nice scratches on your hatch."
4,"good, not great","Does not fit Honda crv, 2009 and has trouble with 2004 odysey. Needs special straps."
4,good,product appears well made and carries 2 bikes well.some mounting suggestions for various bikes would be helpful.
2,Badly designed support bars,"I had exactly the same problem with a Saris Guardian 2, with less damage, however. As we rolled on a highway at a reasonnable speed (110 km/h), I noticed in the rearview mirror that the bikes seemed to have fallen down a bit, on the right side. After stopping, the problem was that the corresponding latch has unlocked. I replaced the supporting arm in the right position, pushed the latch back in place and secured it with a heavy rubber band (blessed He that invented rubber bands). That did the job, but I returned the product to Saris, who provided a new model, the Guardian being discontinued. This new model, the Bike Porter 2, is very poorly designed, cheaply made and unstable, so I returned it also.I think I'll check the other brands. That""s too bad because the older guardian model was almost correct, minus the problem with the locking mechanism.Mike"
1,Not for the Z's,"Horrible fit, missed the earlier review about this not fitting the 350Z, and it doesn't. Can't believe the Saris website can say it does, its not even close.Also, no support from Saris at all. No answer to emails or calls."
4,Saris Guardian 2-Bike Rack,"Bike rack attached to vehicle quickly, with easy set up right out of the box. It also seems to be quite sturdy. Only used localy thus far but we will soon see how it does on the highway."
2,should've told me up front....,"The bike rack seems nice, but who can tell since nowhere does it say that you MUST buy a beam for an additional $35 to use this rack for a women's bike. Returned to Amazon... because for $90 + the additional $35 for the bike beam, I can get something much nicer from my local bike shop."
4,Cool But Messy,"I love that this entirely covers my nano and it looks so cool. My only issue with it is that it doesn't have that coating that prevents lint and dirt from sticking to it so it's always covered in lint when I take it out of my pocket. It comes off easily with a slightly damp towel, but it would be nice if it just had that coating."
2,Avery 3268 Note cards,"Stock fed well and produced excellent color. Cards separated easily producing two cards per sheet. However, the note card once folded in half for a landscape appearance, separated too easily along the top edge producing two note cards instead of one folded card."
2,lay down my sword and sheild,"This was one of his earlier works and it just didn't seem like one of his better ones. actually did not finish it, just seemed to go no where."
2,Did James Lee Really Write This?,"Not until today did I learn that this is a reprint. Thank goodness I read other Burke books before this one. It is dull,rambling, too filled with artsy prose, and has a main character who drinks enough booze most days to kill a normal man.The ""plot"" seems to be about a miscarriage of justice that resulted in the death of a friend. However, along the way we become involved in a labor movement (drunk), go out with friends (drunk), drive around Texas (drunk or drinking, or both). THEN we interrupt the story to go to Korea, get shot, and captured. The prison camp experiences take the stage for a good 10% of the story. After that? Who knows? I am shelving it for a few days to decide whether to finish it or give it to the Goodwill Bookstore.I have really enjoyed Mr. Burke's books, several enough to read twice and buy the Audiobooks as well. Unfortunately, I began to wonder: Did James Lee really write this?"
2,Not one of James Burke best,This is one of the weakest writing I have read from writer James Lee Burke. Rain Gods is a much better pick.
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. Having read all of his previous books, I assumed this one would be good too. The main character Hack Holland is believeable but there is not enough substance to carry the plot. I bought this book to read for my summer vacation up north and ended up with no book to read and no place to buy another one.... can anything be more depressing!..sorry James Lee"
5,Listen to Will Patten Audio,The James Lee Burke books are BEST on audio.Will Patton reads with a soft southern voice that makes the characters live in Burkeland.Just an idea.Linda Palmer
3,An early Holland brothers . . . my least favorite,"Loving the Holland brothers series I was looking forward to reading this early attempt. Very disappointing -- the characters are mere shadows of their later selves. In later books these two characters are very well developed, complex and distinctly different. Not my favorite."
1,Weak and tedious,"As with all other books by James Lee Burke, this is beautifully written. However, the hero(?), Hack Holland, never seems believable to me. To the extent he is, I utterly dislike him - he's a two-dimensional character who is an alcoholic and a womanizer. That I can take, but what I don't understand is why such a nogood would have the slightest interest in Mexican laborers, other that to get drunk a lot and often have sex with a beautiful Spanish woman.It's as if an untalented writer wrote most of a book and, then, paid James Lee Burke to write the descriptive parts. I'll admit that, according to my Kindle download, I've read only 85% of the book. However, I doubt I'll read the rest because I really just have no interest in finding out what happens to Hack Holland, his girlfriend, wife or brother.I'm going back to Dave Robicheaux."
3,works,It's not a beismeyer that's for sure.It takes alot more turns of the knob to loosen and tighten it on the fence.I personally don't like the magnifying curser.It screws me up when I'm trying to read the tape measure. I have a hard time figuring out the 1/4 inch lines from the 1/8's and 1/16's lines.But it does work and seems accurate once you dial it in with the adjustable stop screw.
1,Way too long!,"Welcome to the incredibly boring world of the Mississippi Valley. If you have to read this book, the last paragraph of each chapter will sum everything up for you. There is also a ten page summary at the end of the book! So if this is required reading, don't sweat it. You can get everything you need out of this book in ten minutes! Please don't waste your time reading the entire book."
5,Exquisite Songwriting and Lyrics,"Did not think Lloyd could ever top his 'NY' debut - the self titled 'Lloyd Cole' - but 'Love Story' ups the ante. Few if any singers combine wit, melody and song craft the way Cole can. The album holds together with an underlying theme of the trials of middle age life crossed with wavering idealism. Check out all the tracks."
5,A Perfect June Gift,"A friend left this book in my hangar this afternoon and I read it cover to cover at home tonight on my deck, rocking in a big rope hammock before the sun could set. Listen to the words here, dear reader and discover all over again the joy of flight and love, wrapped in humor and caring. For the pilots among us, at last a flying parable with integrity we can read to our children and revel in ourselves."
4,Perfect for both ferret lovers and pilots.,"I have been a keen ferret lover and my father is a pilot, so this book gives something for both. While the pilot vocabulary can be difficult for those with little experience in flying, the story is simple and enjoyable. I like to think of Baxter as the true hero, I named my own ferret after him. And the spritual transcendence of Bach's books like Jonathan Livingston Seagull are again reflected, which seem to parallel with concepts of the afterlife and how our departed loved ones are much closer to us than we think. A wonderful read with a very heartwarming narrative for both children and adults, and for those who simply love ferrets and flying. Thank you, Richard Bach."
2,For pilots only,"OK, OK - we know Bach is a pilot already! Did he have to prove it once more by filling these not-quite-200 pages with endless technical jargon and flight instructions? There's little room left (if you're still awake) for the measly spiritual insights. I gave this 2 stars because I'm kind, but I'm considering returning the book... Read Bach's classic older books - but leave these Ferrets alone."
1,Fiction,"I'm really sorry to say this and I hope you don't take offence, but there's only one word in the English language that most precisely describes people like Tom Bower: propagandist."
5,A look from inside,"I've seen people say this book does not cover the mainstream or is not the best read, but I would disagree. Hersch takes the time to listen, to let 8 students tell their story. I was in high school at the time when this book was being published, and it is much more accurate that most adults care to realize. It is a narrative, but it is an accurate look at the millennial generation. The only other book that I have seen to compete in accuracy would be 'Hurt' by Chap Clark, but it is more of an academic read. Anyway, if you care for an inside look of adolescence, here is your chance."
5,What a pitiful world it will be when these children grow up.,"As a non-parent, I can't say for sure how I would raise children if I were to have them myself...but I would most certainly try to raise them, rather than ignore them, give them mixed signals, or at worst, condone that they break rules, regulations, and laws both in school and out of school. Apparently, this would place me in the minority.Although I think Hersch does some sensationalizing, the warnings are clear: In a society that seems to reward selfish indulgence and the pursuit of material goods, many parents are leaving child-rearing on the back burner.And when these children grow up and are imparted with the responsibility to run our corporations and government, we are all going to be a heap of trouble.Great book. Should be required reading for all parents."
5,An Insight on the Segmented Society,"Taken alone this is a enthralling and interesting book that attempts to delve into the depths of the current generational dichotomy. I applaud the author's attempt to be an accepted outsider, and her willingness to let the subjects tell their own story. Their perspectives should give anyone not in their generation reason to pause and evaluate why it is so different, and how we have forgotten that we once lived their fears out in our own lives.I strongly recommend Jay Mathews' CLASS STRUGGLE, Jon Krakauer's INTO THE WILD, and Thomas Ricks' MAKING THE CORPS as accompaniment to anyone looking for the motives of those born after 1977. Taken together they create a mosaic snapshot of the segmentation of society that is found in fullest view within Generation Y, but is slowly permeating our whole society."
2,Caution about this book and author,"While I applaud the basic premise that teens have been allowed to raise themselves and society should correct its approach, I must tell you that my conclusion in reading the book and then hearing the author speak is that she is truly in it for the sensational and ""what sells."" I do not believe for a minute that she is truly impassioned with this topic but only as a journalist(and I count myself in that number) found a hot topic. By her own admission, she is working on another book of similar content and my only caution is not to hire her as a speaker. She has no professional background in this area except to realize what will sell books. A true word of caution do not use your organization's money to bring her in as a speaker, because that is truly how she plans to make more money. Just publishing a book does not make a writer an authority."
1,""":42 Minutes? What a joke.""",I bought this because I loved the book. The book is 192 pages so I should have questioned why only :42 minutes? You get one chapter worth of the entire book. How can they do that? What a rip off. Save your money!
5,Back to the roots,I've been a Skynyrd fan since the first time I heard them in 1973 and its been a long time coming that I've enjoyed every song on one cd.This album was made the way music should be put together where every song on an album is good it shows that Skynyrd can still rock with the best of them.I was skeptical about buying the cd now I can't quit playing it.For all you Skynyrd fans out this cd is worth the money you pay for it.
1,hacknayed trite,"The song Red, White and Blue is the most hacknayed neo-patriotic trite I think I've ever heard!! I love old Skynyrd and if you listen closely to Ronnie Van Zandts' lyrics he was for gun control, responsible drinking, etc....a good 'ol boy for sure but he knew the evils of going too far...apparently the new skynyrd didn't listen to any of there old albums!! Very bad and uniminagitive!!"
1,Vicious cycle ran out of gas,"Wow... where to start, This is the worst cd I have ever bought. I have been a fan since ""pronounced"".The boys in the band have never sounded lamer. From lyrics only a mullet head would love (and I know a little), to recycled 80's riffs with washed out synths. There is some wasted firepower here.Huey,Gary,Ricky, all phoned this one in.This should have been the soundtrack to Joe Dirt.Dont even get me started on the Kid Rock awful remake of ""gimme back my bullets""! Gimme back my money! If anyone wants real southern rock,that has grown up and moved on get Hittin the Note by the Allman Brothers Band."
1,Poor excuse for Skynyrd,"This is by far the poorest Lynyrd Skynyrd cd ever made. Tired cliched lyrics.80's retread riffs and synth fills.A total waste of guitarists.Lynyrd Skynrd has some loyal fans and they deserve better than this.The juvenile lyrics...come on Johnny, your better than that man.And the kid rock track is an insult to the original.I am sorry to say I bought it. Gimme back my bullets...nah! GIMME BACK MY MONEY! If you want real southern rock get Hittin The Note, by the Allman Brothers Band."
4,Best Skynyrd as of late,"This CD definitely has more of the ""classic"" Lynyrd Skynyrd honky tonk tone to it. Of course the hit Red, White, and Blue is being played a lot on radio now, but I'm pretty sure we will hear many more of these tunes on rock radio. Gimme Back my Bullets w/ Kid Rock is great, it has a nice hard edge to it. My favorites are That's the Way I Like It, Pick 'em Up, Red, White, and Blue, Hell or Heaven, Rockin' Little Town, and Lucky Man."
3,good and bad in one,"Mixed feelings about it...pretty 'clean' sound ( if anything, just a TINY too much reverb on vocals and drums ), guitars sound very clean though.LOVE LOVE LOVE the pro-America themes, sick and tired of the anti-America music running rampant, so, I enjoy good solid rock/blues/countryish pro-America feel to the discIt does feel a bit over-produced, just a bit, and most people, I suspect, like the 'harder' edge to some of the earlier original bands music, production techniques and sound board apps are better now then in LS's heyday, but I think I still prefer the music to sound just a touch rawer or underproduced.I would give this 3 1/2 stars myself, but man oh man, what a great muscular line-up of guitarists on here, no doubt about it"
2,"Overproduced, hit and miss in quality of songs","Skynyrd is my all time favorite band, but their writing on this album just doesn't do the real band's legacy justice. A lot of the songs are corny, corny enough for country music radio. Red, white and blue--geez, gimme a break. CORN! And then other songs that are somewhat better, like ""The Way"" are just way overproduced with strings and junk. It's like they're trying to make the song better by laying on more and more production, until it starts sounding like the 1812 Overture. How about some raw, guitar-bass-drums-piano driven rock and roll? THAT'S what Skynyrd is mostly known for. This just doesn't cut it. What Gov't Mule and the North Mississippi Allstars have done lately (barring the Mule's latest crappy reggae album) is more of an extension of true Southern Rock than what the current version of Skynyrd is doing here. Avoid this if you're looking for true Skynyrd quality music, and check out Gov't Mule and the North Mississippi Allstars!"
5,Vicious Cycle,"Vicious Cycle is not only the best Skynyrd cd I have heard, but I would have to say it is one the best cds I have ever heard. I think The Way (#4) is the best song lyrically and musically on the cd. The remake of Gimme Back My Bullets with Kid Rock is awesome. I always thought the original version was their worst single released, but this remake is great. Pick Em Up is probably my least favorite on this cd, but it is still good. My favorites are The Way, Life's Lessons, Rockin' Little Town, and Sweet Mama. Vicious Cycle has some of the most thought provoking lyrics that I've heard on songs like The Way, Hell or Heave, and Life's Lessons."
3,not as good as twenty or edge of forever,if you are a fan of the modern skynyrd then you won't like this cd. the previous 2 releases are much better. nothing on this cd matches the power of preacher man or we aint much different.
3,LYNYRD SKYNYRD,"I bought this CD today on accident I thought it was the new greatest hits one but I bought this one titled Vicous Cycle. When I listened to it I was dissapointed this CD goes further down hill then ever I am a classic rock fan I love the early Skynyrd not this new stuff that sounds mostly like country music. The two cool songs on this CD are All Funked Up, and Jake the rest is crap. My advice would be to not buy this if you like rock if you love this band then buy it. I am stuck with this CD it truely sucks expesically the new version of Gimme Back My Bullets featuring Kid Rock. This CD is a Vicious Cycle worst music ever. I rated it a three because it still is worth listening to once. Well the rest is up to you buy it or not listen to the samples and ENJOY?"
1,I've been had,I payed $15.99 for garbage! Where was this thing recorded? A bedroom? I've heard better demo's from eith graders.
5,You must have this guide!!,"This is, hands-down, the most informative and engaging guide to Disney out there, loaded with tips on how to make your trip perfect for you and your children."
3,How boring scientists can thinking,"Wordy and boring. One math book I read has an epigraph ""Mathematicians try to convince us a logical way on subjects they discovered illogically.Children at large are not scientists and will nether think a scientist way.The literature require some drama to attract children attention.This book is full of artificial examples with closer to philosophy discussions of those examples.This approach may fit high school math class but water still needs to be distilled to save class time.On a positive side problem solving steps are precise."
5,Sweat Sweat Sweat!,"Excellent Workouts! It consists of three workouts. I usually do the first DVD (two workouts) as my 1.5 hours exercise routine and the second DVD (one 55 mins workout) as my 1 hour exercise routine.Those workouts guarantee every single muscle get exercised!I could not buy the Amped ""stick"" since International ship is not supported. Still, the workouts without it made me sweaty."
2,Disappointing for the Experienced Tae Bo-er,"My husband is an avid Billy Blanks fan. He has several of his DVDs (Christmas presents from me!), but this one was disappointing, he said. Too much talk during the exercises and his heart rate doesn't stay elevated. This is more for a beginner in Tae Bo than someone experienced in it."
1,Billy's ready for retirement,"This was utterly disappointing. I've been using the older Tae Bo videos for several years now, but this ""newer"" workout is a complete waste of my time. It takes 10 minutes before anything meaningful happens, and, like other reviewers stated, there's not enough flow to keep my heart rate up. It's just a ridiculously easy work out. The worst part though is how clearly made up on the spot the routine is. Billy is half way through making up a new exercise when the thunder plays, and he doesn't even hear it at first. He's getting cues that it is time to do cool down, and he's not even ready for it. It's like someone called him unexpectedly and asked him to show up at the studio to jam out a quick 40 minute tape and then go home. I feel totally ripped off."
3,Old Tae Bo > New Tae Bo,"I bought the 3-dvd pack without the amplifier bar, and I did like that the workout instruction demonstrates both.However, I was a big fan of the original Tae Bo videos and used to play the VHSs and rewind and play them again. The new moves are the same, but there is less of the boxing emphasis I love. The best part about Tae Bo is kicking and punching and I feel like in an attempt to include the amplifier bar they left that by the way-side a bit.It is a great fat burner and will get your heart rate up, but if you were a fan of the old Tae Bo you may be a bit disappointed. Billy also loses track of time in the first dvd (Fat Burn Accelerator) and abruptly announces the workout portion is over. Even though it doesn't really affect the workout, it still really annoys me."
5,Nice progression...,"This is just my opinion, but I definitely saw a progression as I moved through each of the three workouts. The Jump Start Cardio was very easy for me. But as you move through the other two workouts you can feel the increase in intensity. I'm very glad I purchased this DVD, and I added it to my rotation of Tae Bo workouts."
1,too much stop-and-start,"I am very disappointed with all three workouts. with names like ""jump start cardio"" and ""fat burn accelerator"" I expect to get my heart rate up and keep it there--no chance of that here. There is no flow in the movements. Billy makes you do a move super slow like 8 times, then makes you ""amp"" it up, to do it way too fast, for 8 more times. then everyone cheers. then you do the other side. then everyone marches and cheers. then you start a new move.how are you supposed to get cardio this way? it was annoying because at times I was out of breath, like I feel when I sprint, but it didn't last. Once in a while there was a move that got my heart rate up, but then you stop to march out and cheer and it comes back down. especially since these workouts are SO LONG ti's just a waste of time. I am really sorry that I bought these DVDs. I'm going to donate them to my local public library."
4,had to have it!,"I bought this ""first"" cd after having bought the second one (first!). Can you follow that? Well, the second is still my favorite, but this is an enjoyable cd with some funny lyrics as well as more serious songs. I do believe I'll buy anything Eric Dodge records!"
3,Yancy Butler looking her best,"Professional assasin Jeff Fahey is hired by gorgeous Yancy Butler to kill the man suspected of murdering her husband. Naturally the two leads wind up in bed afterwards, but a complicated double cross leads to mayhem and a struggle to survive. James Coburn's acting is sub-par for him. But Yancy Butler fans won't care, because this is the film where she looks her best (though the nude shot is buxom stand-in Amy-Rochelle Weiss). Yancy in her black swimsuit and numerous close-ups of her face make this important for her fans. For everyone else, it is just another bloody suspense thriller . . . which is not good news for Butler fans hoping this will make it to DVD."
3,Unexpected.,I returned this product as it did not offer the sounds and light effects we expected. It was a basic and probably durable lightsaber.
5,A love story whose obsession corrodes your readerly defenses,"Switching back and forth between 1998 and 1972, and between multiple points of view, Keith Banner constructs a quest for salvation through love that is utterly original. The plot twists, flashbacks, and variations on the themes of love, memory, guilt, and redemption are tours de force. But the characters are what burrow into your brain--Indiana trailer trash who are fully human, and whose perversions induce sympathy, not revulsion. Who'd a thunk this could be done to such a tee, especially with langauge that is unassuming but poetic at the same time? Bravo, Banner!"
5,message,"MESSAGE:In my new book by Edwin Mellen Press you list me TWICE as author, including as Daniel A. Matraux. My name is Daniel A. Metraux and I am the sole author of this book"
2,Basically just a clip art book,"This book is basically just a clip art book of 1920's fashions. There are lots of black and white line drawings and some color plates. No years or descriptions are given for any of the outfits, you just have to guess at what year each of the outfits are from. Not worth buying if you are interested in fashion history, but good if you are looking for clip art."
4,WHAT A PAGE TURNER,"This book really gets into a mind of a sexual predator, and explains what they're thinking and of their ""sick actions"" towards innocent young children!!!! But, i can't put the book down!!!"
4,How Did This One Get By Me?,"I took this one on a trip and found that airport time flew by as I became engrossed in the mystery of Dr. Michael Stone. From an own experience with issues of child abuse I can say from experience that the author is pretty much on the money about 1) the legal system (in certain places and this was published in 1997) and 2) sexual offenders.I am definitely going to search out the other books in this series.The only thing I found somewhat wryly interesting, was that even though the main story is set in the north, why the Southern background of the lead characters in books of this ilk?Kate Scapetta, Clarice Starling, Tempe Brennan, Deborah Knott come to mind at once and I'm sure there are others. Seems like there is at least a term paper here."
3,graphic,"This was an interesting mystery that kept you turning pages; however, I did guess the killer's identity. It suffered a bit from first-novel-itis in that the author *told* you much more than showed you. In spots it read like a text on sex offenders. For me, the novel was disturbing and too graphic about child sex abuse although the insights gained were valuable and I did not feel it was exploitative or salacious. I did enjoy the protagonist and found her a fun cross of Deborah Knott, Kinsey Milhone and Clarissa Starling not to mention the sex-offender equivalent of Hannibal Lecter."
3,Black and white political movie,"This movie is alright. I guess even better than some of the currant movies on politics.(example: Bob Roberts)This movie starts out slow but once you have made it past this point, it holds your interest. If your burned out on this subject you might want to wait a while before you see this."
2,movie selections,"was disappointed that the movies listed in the advertisement in the newspapers and some TVs was incomplete. Wanted Casablanca which was in the original listing and was why I bought the collection. When received, learned the ads were false. Probably would not have purchased it knowing Casablanca was not included."
2,Boring -,"I don't know how this movie won three Academy Awards. The story is quite simple (corruption fighter swept into power, becomes corrupt himself) and the ending predictable (assassinated). The acting is so-so. Viewers also are 'treated' to a couple of lukewarm love stories in between. Save your shekels and watch something else."
3,No insight.,"Great performances, especially by Broderick Crawford, can't really save this movie, which doesn't give any insight into why things happened the way they did. Without knowing why the main character becomes corrupted, it's just a downer of a movie, an overlong cliche.Meet the new boss, same as the old. Or, it doesn't matter who you vote for, the government always gets in. Or, to defeat the machine, you must become the machine.That's about it.The only extras on this 2006 release are just promos for the Sean Penn remake."
3,A Movie Bio of Huey Long,Broderick Crawford did a fine job in the title role. Of course all knew that it was really the partial life story of the late Huey (Kingfish) Long of Louisiana; some said he was the ultimate politician. The way that he went from what seemed like a decent guy to a real degenerate was portrayed in a realistic manner.This is a movie that I wanted to watch once but probably not again for a long time. Older people will remember the real life part; younger readers will see again the power of some of the black and white films.
4,All The King's Men,"Sometimes the remake is better than the original, in this case the original is far better than the remake."
4,More things change,"...the more they stay the same. A classic film that's a little raw in its telling, but is still a film with a lot to say. Broderick Crawford gives a great performance of a 'Hick' lawyer that pulls himself through the muck with good intentions, but soon finds out how much mud can stick to you and sling onto others. There are elements in this film that is still true and relevant to our political officials to this day. A man is born in sin and raised in corruption, after all. A good film that all movie lovers should see."
4,Never again as good. Brodrick Crawford is another of that,"select group of actors who peak early in their career. In his case it is 1949, he won an Oscar, & never again got close. Eventually Crawford moved to the small screen where we,of a certain age, remember him on ""Highway Patrol"". But his best was better than most. His character, in All the King's Men, is Willie Stark, an idealistic, honest, populist politician bucking the system. He is also ambitious & seeing his opportunity, seizes it. His greed, lust for power & ego run amok & turn him into the very thing he had fought against only worse. He corrodes everything & everybody he touches & comes to a fitting end a 'la Huey Long, the man on which the film & presumably the book were loosely based. Highly recommended for all who like this style of political noir or junkies."
4,Respect His Gangsta!!!!,"The city of Memphis has been known as the ""Birth Of Crunk"" throughout the Hip Hop industry. Nasty Nardo continues to carry on the legacy of 8-Ball & MJG, 3-6 MAFIA, and others with this album. This album represents classic Memphis style with a new flava. From the local radio favorite ""Bout to Click on 'Em"" to the ghetto sexual ""Let's Get A Room"" featuring the ""Queen of Memphis"" Gangsta Boo, the album gives the listener plenty of crunk for the trunk. The last song on the album, ""Cartel Ni--az"" give you the classic posse song flava that the M-Town has been known for. Be on the lookout for releases from other artist that appear on this album like BURN UNIT, Tom Skeemask, Chopper Girl, Boss King, MG and the BTP, and Longboy Ent."
4,Something I Grew Into,"I've been practicing yoga and meditation for about 3 years now. The first of Cannon's albums I was introduced to was OM Reverberation of Source. I instantly loved it, particularly on headphones or at a decent volume level through speakers. I tried some of his other albums at the time and didn't really like them (listened to cuts on spiritvoyage.com before they were offered on Amazon). Now after a couple more years, I tried this one again along with OM Namah Shivaya and find that I really like them both. Again, I really like them played fairly loud over speakers or through a nice pair of earphones (like Etymotics). Most of my meditations are 20-30 minutes, although I might start the CD during the last 20 minutes of my yoga practice when I'm working through twists and seated forward bends.I don't know that the music does all that Charles Cannon says it does on his website, but I do find it often easier to quiet the mind with these particular CDs."
2,keepsake box,I've had it for 2 weeks and it's already falling appart. not very good quility for how much they charge you for a BOX.
2,shadow box,The insert inside matched the size of the box. This normally isn't a problem but when you add fabric to the side that creates an issue with getting it out. I had to cut all 4 corners once I got out to be able to get in and out. Other than that issue I like the box.
3,Decent book; worth the money,"Basically common-sense suggestions for the traveler. Nothing likely to be news to anyone with much experience, but well written and entertaining. Perhaps a little superficial but that's to be expected when you try to cover an entire continent in one book."
2,"Rick ""Kick Me Charlie"" Steves","While I find that the Rick Steves books have interesting info, I can't get past his loser mind-set. It seems, to Mr. Steves, that we should respect and honor everyone else's culture except for our own. He makes a BIG point in explaining to us egotistical Americans that nobody wants to trade passports with us, so don't go thinking America is the greatest country there is. Let a Parisian bite your head off about the Bush administration - suck it up, Bud! Sure, Mr. Brit, kick me in the pants because you've met some loud and rude Americans - heck! I deserve it! I'm an (sotto voice) American. I don't know why he doesn't move to Europe and stay there."
1,Section on Turkey is judgemental and opiniated,"""Tourists are learning that the image of the terrible Turk is false, created to a great degree by it unfriendly neighbors. Turks are quick to remind visitors that, surrounded by Syria, Iraq, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Bulgaria, and Greece, they're not living in Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.""This is a direct quote.It sounds like they're trying to say that the surrounding countries are painting an incorrect negative image of Turkey. Which is amusing, since he listed both Greece and Armenia there, which were both targeted by Turkey. Either this writing staff has no idea what they're writing and is just happy to sell books, thinking no one will double check the info, or they're Racist and opinionated. Either way, I wouldn't trust the info in here even as a rough guide on where to go."
3,Caveat Empor!,"Warning: this book is NOT a country-by-country travel guide for Europe, filled with specific information on prices, buses, trains, and local site recommendations like ""Let's Go Europe"" or ""Lonely Planet's Western Europe.""It is a general guide to European travel with a explanations of what to take, how to pack, and single paragraph descriptions of what to see in each city to help you decide on an intinerary. While this might be useful for those who this is their first trip to Europe, this is not for those who are looking to update their pre-Euro copies of local guidebooks.Rick Steves' individual country/reigional guides are wonderful for specific country information and quickly getting you oriented in a location and to the places of interest. However, unlike the books that you would find this next to on the shelf, this is not a handy general compliation of the more specific guides."
5,"Great ""inside"" information","Invaluable information that I will use this September, to be more like a native and less like a tourist."
5,THE FEELERS ROCK,"The Feelerrs are an absolutely Awsome rock bandThey have a style a little like BUSH, the second album Communicate is the best I have heard of them, With Communicate, As good as it gets and Fragile being my favouritesA new album has just also been released and Im sure that will not disappoint eitherIf you get the chance its Definitely worth listening too"
2,"losing steam, repeating self","This book is inexpensive, so I don't have a huge bone to pick with Pilkey regarding repetition, but this one is weak compared to the first two in the series, which I read to my daughter often. SHE likes volume three, of course, but to the parents out there brave enough to read such stuff to their kids, get the first two first, because then you can laugh with your kids, too. Great titles, though. They had the same effect on me as the book title ""A Man Cut in Slices"" had on Henry Miller in Tropic of Cancer. Books like these will be embraced by parents who enjoy watching their children jump with joy in mud puddles instead of scolding them about imminent stains in pants."
2,What the [word I can't say at a kids book section]?!,"This is the worst of the lot.CU must stop alien cafeteria ladies (who replaced the quit ones after being publicly humiliated by Tree-House Comix). They want to all the kids into zombie-nerds through milkshakes!The thing that saved one half a star was the humor (that wasn't as good) and the action. Imagine, 2 pranksters and a over-weight, ugly principal in underpants swinging above 7-yearold zombie nerds! Another half was the mix of the two, like that example!"
5,Warning! This book is very exciting book,"Captain Underpants And The Invasion of the Incredibly Naughty Cafateria Ladies From Outer space (and the Subsequent Assault of the Equally Evil Lunchroom Zombie Nerds) by Dav Pilkey is a fiction story with exciting characters that keeps you reading until the end of the book. The main idea of the involves George and Harold who tricked the Cafeteria ladies made them mad. So they stopped making lunch and went to other school. Then an evil cafeteria ladies started to make lunch and made the students into zombie nerds with their potion. But George, Harold, and Captain Underpants destroy the evil and helps everybody. You should read this book because it's very exciting."
5,Hilarious,My son is six and read each book in 2 days laughing all the time. He is reading the 2nd book for the 2nd time and now is interested in other chapter books.
4,Parent's Choice; good starter for chapter books.,"My 6 year old loves Captain Underpants. He loves to read and we wanted to keep him challenged with chapter books without overwhelming him. After trying chapter books on his favorite movies to minimal enthusiasm, we found the Cap.U series. When he reads one he can hardly put it down. Sometimes he doesn'tput one down until he's finished it. But its true the flip o rama does require assistance not to rip the pages. Still...buy the series. By the way...epic novel # 8 is a two parter. We made the mistake of buying only one."
4,THE BEST BOOK YOU EVER READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,its just plain funny.i think its the best book ever.its really funny espeicaly when the aliens blow up their own ship.
4,This Book Is Great!,This book is good. when I read it I couldnt put it down. But it could be longer I've read all of Captian Underpants. I've read this one lots of times.
5,Jazz X - Peace And Niceness CD,"This CD is really excellent. i've been looking for since 1998. I can say it's a rarity. The shipping period has been short and the conditions: ""like-new"". i'm completely satisfied with it. thanx to the seller."
2,Why did such a good manufacturer make such a defective product?,"I got my Paint Remover 2 days ago and got it around to using it today. Unfortunately, after stripping a 2 ft x 4 inch area not one, but two, of the plastic guard doors flew off into the air. The retaining springs that held them on to the pin are long gone. I was skeptical of the other negative reviews regarding these plastic doors. My apologies, they were being generous.As far as being able to rate the performance of the product, I will have to pass because I couldn't use the thing because of all the uncontained paint chips flying everywhere!I have boxed up the paint remover and am having to return it."
4,Historic home lifesaver,"Having now removed multiple layers of paint from an 1890 Charleston area home and a 1926 N.C. Mission style bungalow-- this product is a lifesaver as it effectively removes layers (not with one swipe, though) better than anything else we have tried... and we tried many! We were able to connect the ""exhaust"" attachment to our shopvac via duct tape as the manufacturers' venting apparatus wasn't available. Worked very well-- essential when removing layers of old lead-based paint. Yes, side doors popped off almost immediately even though we were forewarned and were very careful. Would give 5 stars if not for this disadvantage. Still, it is the greatest!"
2,Disapointed,"I tried this out on a small job and within 5 minutes that little door thing was gone. Don't know how as I was pretty carefull with it after the reviews. Does not strip as fast as I would like and timing myself my old burner was faster but probably equal in time as I had to sand afterwards. Decided the tool was not what it should be and decided to return it. Bad news, this CPO company does not do this. I am now stuck with this tool I used for 1 day. Now to purchase a door for it and dump it. I have other Metabo tools which are fine but my biggest disapointment is this CPO company. I will be sure not to make that mistake again."
1,Vol. 4 vs. Vol. 6,I too ordered Volume 6 and received Volume 4. That seems to be endemic with this order. The task at hand is how does one get volume 6?
1,Incorrect labeling,"I have tried two different sources to obtain this DVD. While the case and disk are labeled ""Kata 6,"" the actual material is Kata 4. Be warned.The quality of the series is OK -- although instruction is in spoken Japanese, without subtitling."
4,Great walk-about of West Africa,"I have enjoyed this book. I find Green's observations and history of West Africa very insightful. I admit, I have not verified any of his history, but from other readings from the area, it seems consistent. I truely enjoyed his swaying view of the real existence of magic. His internal struggle seems logical, even though his subject is magic. I found sometimes that his story slows a bit too much, but that said, I would recommend this book."
5,A Gorgeous Book,"I charged this book out of the Beaverton, Oregon, library and may buy it for a friend who loves hummingbirds. It's beautiful. It contains many interesting facts and was an easy read. Some of the information could be used by school teachers to do a nice lecture for their students with a subsequent homework assignment to learn more about birds."
4,Almost like new.,"I got a good price on this book, but was surprised when I received it that there was apersonal inscription inside the front cover. I bought this book as a memorial to a friendand gave it to the Library in her memory. They were kind enough to paste a memorial noteover the inscription, so all was good.The book is beautiful, full of factual information I've never read anywhere else. And thepictures are awesome! Well worth the price I paid."
1,some people will praise anything . . .,"Father of fantasy, my foot. I gave this ridiculous ""story"" sixty pages and am still waiting for something to happen. The epic tradition of Tolkien and (arguably) Lewis hails from the Mabinogion and (also arguably) the Kalevala, not from some pathetic effort by Macdonald to pen a ""fantasy"" that my twin four-year-olds could outdo."
5,"Great to start golf, great to review","This DVD is very well done, Gary's experience as a TV commentator provides a solid performance that is pleasant to watch, and best of all, gives a great series of lessons.I've gotten a lot out of this DVD, highly recommended!"
4,Good for golf dummies as well as others.,"This was a very imfomative and entertaining DVD. Gary did a good job in explaining all areas of golfing. Although the video goes a little fast at times, you can always back it up and see it again. Would purchase this video even if you do have a little golf experience...it is good to brush up on your techniques."
4,not bad,This dvd is actually pretty helpful. It is no substitute for practice but works well. I wish it had a book that came with it to take outside when I do practice.
5,Great set for starters,"I am getting back into the game after a 20 year hiatus. I wanted to find one book / video combo that covered everything. This set was exactly what I was looking for. The video helped to bring the text to life and the drills are very helpful. If you are just starting or getting back into the games buy this combo. It will give you a good foundation to work from. I recommend reading the book, watching the video, practicing, and taking some lessons."
3,golf for Dummies,"Good dvd for the price , not the best video production in the world. Still pretty good golf video."
2,Golf Instruction,"Guess I was a ""Dummie"" for ordering this item. But it's great for someone just starting the game."
2,Won't exchange sizes.,"Vision Streetwear does NOT exchange any of their footwear. They will take them back-at YOUR expense. So, in the end, the great price isn't so great."
4,God is alive and well,"The way this debate is put together it is easy for a Christian to feel validated and hopeful in the pursuit of Gods Grace.Loved it, John"
3,Not as focused as I would like,I am not sure what I was expecting. I suppose I was looking for more of a theoretical discussion. There was more about the individuals than I expected.
4,Good Video,Like this video after seeing play Freud's last session.Like this video after seeing play Freud's last sessionThe end
5,Very Thought Provoking!,"This video gave an excellent view of the countering views on God of Freud and C.S. Lewis. But it also contained interesting information about the lives of those two men. I will definitely use it in several of the college Psychology classes I teach. It is also interesting to watch ""educated"" people talking about the existence of God."
2,Mildly engaging...,"The PBS program was mildly engaging as I remember. It gave a lot of interesting insights into the lives and times of both Lewis and Freud. Still, it left much to be desired in the way of real advancement or meaningful discussion about the existence of God and belief. The panel of ""experts"" are far from expert in their comments, which are more random and opinionated, rather than meaningful or insightful. As a student of philosophy of religion, there is no more frustrating thing than to see an opportunity for fruitful discussion get wasted by people who don't have a clue about what they're discussing. Perhaps a panel of honest thinkers, instead of talking heads, would make for a more interesting program in the future."
5,great comedy,Not recommended for everyone but Bill Hicks was a great biting comedian. Great commentary on our society and very entertaining.
5,This is my title for my review,"I thought this CD was wonderful when I got it... and I still do. Simply put, I listened to the CD enough to where I didn't laugh as much as I once did, but I still listen to it to get insightful, intelligent, information from an evolved being.""I'll show you politics in America: 'I think the puppet on the right shares my beliefs.' 'I think the puppet on the left is more to my liking.' 'Wait, there's one guy holding up both puppets!' 'Shut up! Go back to bed America. Your government is in control. Here's Love Connection, watch this and get fat and stupid. By the way, keep drinking beer you fu*king morons!'"""
1,"""Rant"" is an accurate title for this one","Not much in the way of humor on this one (""Easter Eggs"" and ""Orange Drink""-which was stolen from Bobcat Goldthwait, of all people-being the lone exceptions). If you like George Carlin's ""angry"" period, where he rails against everything without being funny, you'll like this. If you're looking for laughs, spend your money elsewhere."
3,Angry Bill,"This certainly isn't Bill's best. It is not on par with ""Relentless"" or ""Dangerous"". It's far angrier and as a result less humorous than those 2 recordings.I am not sure if the excess vitriol is because Bill knew he was dying of cancer when these sessions were recorded, but whatever the reason for it, the humor suffered. Bill's humor was often controversial and always had a bite to it, but the anger is over the top on Rant.There are certainly some good bits on here, but they are few and far between. I only laughed a handful of times on first listen, mostly during the second half of the disc. I did not find that much funny material near the beginning.Avid fans of Bill will probably like this, but I would not recommend it to a first time listener. I like Bill's body of work, but I prefer ""Relentless"" or ""Dangerous""."
5,The Genius of Bill Hicks,"A friend of mine let me borrow his Bill Hick's CD, Rant in E-minor after I let him borrow Dangerous. I listened to it in the car and almost hit someone because I was laughing so hard! Bill Hicks was a comic genius, and the world just seems a little less funny without him. If you are easily offended by jokes about abortion and religion, then you should buy this album. Maybe you will see how absurd it all is. If you are an intelligent, open-minded, well-rounded individualist, buy this album right away and join the rest of us in knowing what a brilliant man Bill Hicks was."
4,Tribal sounds from the forests and wonderful Violeta Parra composition,"First heard this recording around 1987. Still enjoy listening to it. Particularly good is Dario's rendering of the Violeta Parra song, El Guillatún. There are one or two other great tracks. Worth buying the CD just for these!Christina O'ShaughnessyGeneva, Switzerland[...]"
4,Singin' & Dancin',"While living with a friend; one night she came home from a party still singin'and dancin'. She was singin' and dancin' still to the beat of Mickey Hart's ""Where Love Goes"". She came in the house, put in the CD, and started dancing around the living room. This was the first time I'd ever heard of Mickey Hart, and soon I was joining her in my slippers! From then on I listened to that Song every morning while getting reading for work. Not the whole CD, but that song. I'd set the CD player to Repeat, and dance and sing aroung the house while getting ready for my day. I insist that this song was a terrific motivator to set up your day with a smile and inspirtation. To sum it up, this song was a keeper from the first time I heard it. That's the reason for the 4 stars though. Not any of the other songs caught my attention like this one. However,I still ended up buying the whole CD, just for ""Where Love Goes""."
5,Mickey Mixing Percussion with Catchy melody...,"Yes, Mickey sings on this! But don't let that stop you from buying this. There are excellent songs on here (with nice lyrics by Hunter).Highlights include: Where Love Goes (Sito), Down The Road (with Mickey on lead vocal), Only The Strange Remain (Mickey on lead again), Santre de Cristo, and Sandman. But the whole CD just makes you want to groove!Yes, this CD might surprise you - either you'll hate it or love it. It is a nice cohesive piece of well crafted songs that bring out both voice and percussion in equal quanitities.Buy it, you'll be surprised like I was!"
3,Difficult to erect.,"The stand works reasonably well once you have it setup. However the center support is difficult to align when your trying to erect the stand. I had trouble with it before I attached the saw to the table, can't imagine trying to do this with the saw attached. Also, the side rollers, though a nice feature are difficult to align because you must adjust them front and back instead of at one central point. I use mine in a workshop and don't knock it down or move it around much so it works well as a fixed platform. I don't think I would buy it if I needed to move it frequently. Finally, be careful, there are many pinch points on this stand."
2,nasty pinches and blood blisters,"nasty pinches and blood blisters from set up and transport.Very poor packaging, arrived damaged and no number to call.Suggest makers further refine. Does however have advantages including larger wheels compared to other make. Lots ofadjustements possible."
1,Picky Cavalier didn't like them,We have a picky Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with some digestive issues and he did not like these at all.
5,Appleworks for PC & MAC users,"I have always been a PC user, but my wife uses a MAC. She is working on a book using ClarisWorks. She wanted to upgrade and purchased a new Imac with AppleWorks. This book has allowed my to help her with her project. I even bought AppleWorks for my PC."
5,The Missing Manual / AppleWorks 6 by Jim Elferdink,"I am a user of all the Missing Manuals. I would not be without them. This one is well laid out, is easily understood and very helpful. It is always nice to have directions in print. Unfortunately in today's world, the producers of the software do not understand such a concept. That is why we are lucky to have folks like Jim Elferdink to take care of us."
3,The Missing Macros,Page 323-327 tells you how to use the macros in AppleWorks 6. It says to look under FILE and MACROS. If they're there I couldn't find them.
1,Waste of Money - BUYER BEWARE,"This program was a waste of time and money. My son was looking forward to learning to type and, after an hour of installing/uninstalling the program 4 times we FINALLY got to the point where you could enter you name (it wouldn't run the other times we'd installed it), we got an error message and were kicked out of the program. After trying this whole charade again, we tried to call the help number on the CD. The number is out of order.BUYER BEWARE. There's nothing we can do other than throw it in the trash."
5,George Acosta-The Best Trance DJ out there,This cd is about the same style as his late cd AM Edition but this cd sounds better
2,Was misinformed about the version of this single!,"The beat to this song was great, but I was misinformed about the version of this cd. It was the explicit version and I always prefer the edited version. I had to end up giving it to my co-worker. Other than that, the beat is great!"
2,poor binding,"I adored the chunky farm books, and ordered several when my baby was small. However, now that my daughter is 17 months and actively looks at books herself, I have found none of the farm books to withstand time. The binding has come off almost all of them. They are great books for sitting on the top of a shelf, but if you hope your toddler to get much use from them, they won't.Sturdy and long lasting they are NOT!--"
1,binding is terrible,Within minutes of my child getting this book the binding had already come apart. It's just a thin piece of fabric holding it together. I am very disappointed.
3,Pretty Boy Floyd Rules!!!,"Slam Dunk, written by Kevin Dubrow of Quiet Riot and preformed brillantly by the awsome Pretty Boy Floyd is the sole and only redeeming feature of this mediocre collection of songs from an easily forgettable movie. This clearly came out weeks before Nirvana came along and killed great bands like Pretty Boy Folyd, a shame."
4,One of his best,"I have read many of Robert Adams' books. And I found most of them enjoyable and well written.This series is one of his best.Sadly, Robert Adams died over 10 years ago and we won't ever find out how he planed this series to turn out.I do not hesitate to suggest that this book and vol. 1 be read anyway."
5,"First Rate, Very Interesting, Informative.",I bought this book on a whim and found myself totally absorbed. If you are interested in the politics and issues facing the vegetarian and animal advocacy movement today this should be your handbook- it's mine.
5,wonderful,"this is an awesome book, i found it in the library while i was doing a report on vegetarianism. i am already a vegetarian, but this book convinced me to go vegan and i have been doing so successfully so far. tons of info on animal rights and what is being done about it, on vegetarian diets, and environmental concerns of meateating on the environment. a wonderful book."
5,Best bet for the money,"An excellent work table for your saw. I use it with a very heavy 12"" compound sliding miter and it supports the heavy saw just fine. The best bench for the money. For me the only regret is that due to the heavy weight of the saw it would have been nice to have had a folding dolly type table but they are much more expensive and much bulkier as well."
4,Work center,"This is a very quick way to set up your chop saw, you have options as to how long or short the 2x4 or 2x6 depending on what length materials you are using. It folds up and stores in a small space. The horses are great to."
4,"It's too high, but I still like it.","I like the Trojan Work Center in general, but I ordered the 35"" model and after useing it I wish I had the 27"" model. All the parts on the Work Center work fine. I was a little uneasy about the sawhorse legs when I ordered this item, but they are very sturdy. It's also easy to transport. I would recommend the Trojan Work Center as a good value, but unless you're very tall get the 27"" model."
4,good for kindergarten,"We are using these books in second-semester kindergarten. There are books about Johnny Appleseed, Thanksgiving, Martin Luther King, Chinese New Year, George Washington, St. Patrick's Day, etc. Several of these relate directly to the state of Virginia standards of learning. Most of the mini-books are good, with repetitive, easy to read text. In the St. Patrick's day book, a leprechaun asks various animals, ""Have you seen my pot of gold?"" They reply, ""Go ask the pig"" ""Go ask the horse"" etc. A few of the stories seem to be there because the author ran out of good ideas after about 21 or so, but there are enough good ones to make it well worth the price. Some of our students have no books at home, so it is nice for them to have something to take home to keep."
1,Used Toshiba 10 button handfree Telephone,"The phone came broken and unuseable. We tested the phone on our system and came to the conclusion that it was the handset that was not working properly. We got in touch with the seller, and he responded one week later and said he would send us a new handset. That was on June 28th, and we have yet to receive anything or hear back from him(even though I sent him a follow-up e-mail). Today is July 18th, almost 3 weeks later. Looks like we just threw away $26.48 which is not a fortune, but things like this should not happen!"
5,I love these shoes,"At First I was like humm don't know, but when I put them on and wore them I was like these are really cute, I wore them out for the first time, and a lady came to me and said those are cute shoes! Plus I got these at Ross for $10.00"
5,A foundational find!,"Given the price of 'all-inclusive' books today this is one of those hard to believe finds. Dr. Colin does an exceptional overview of the ""American Mediterranean"" which, seasoned by his photography, makes this a must-have book for your personal library. The bibliography alone is worth the purchase price! A sad bit of nostalgia to see the photos of Diadema antillarum, which used to be so common. The author writes of which he does, both to excellence. His academics and photography are inspiring. To add more to the book would change its size and format and that would destroy the uniqueness of it as a carry-along. Get one for the road and one for the shelf."
2,Dissapointing,"This movie gives quite an objective view on what happened during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and that perspective definitely makes it worthwhile to watch. Yet what is missing is strength in character and acting by the cast, and an exciting storyline to support them. I was really disappointed that the ""spark didn't jump"" - the movie leaves the impression that the script was written by a civil servant, that the director was an accountant, and that the actors were postmen (not that I hold any grudge against these honorable professions - just as a matter of speech).So: good to gain some insights in the attack (also the Japanese viewpoint) - but poor in excitement."
2,Tedious to read,"Didn't like the way it was written, too much inner self talking to make it a good read for me."
2,Mixed Feeling,I was really excited about this book but found a very poor constructive story - but had decent writing. Finished about half the book but never got into it.
3,Soldier's Joy,"It took a lonnng time to read this book, and while it was interesting, it was hard to connect all the parts. Almost seemed like a book of separate stories."
3,Reviewer's thoughts,This book is slow to evolve and story line is very repetitive. I thought it was hard to get into the story. Ending was somewhat of a suprise. Characters were diversed and setting was well done.
2,613 pages still no action,I've read 613 pages of this book and yet nothing significant has happened. Sooooo boring! Very disappointed. Won't buy anything else from this author. This is ridiculous
2,A Soldier's boring life,"This was one of the most tedious books I have ever plowed through. The characters were flat, the setting(s) were boring. I do think the author showed some expertise in writing about the music, but I found it unbelievably dull throughout. I always finish books, so it was a challenge."
2,For some reason this one is not as good as the gold version.,"I had ordered the gold pen before and I loved it since it just glided on paper and never skipped or clogged. I ordered this silver one expecting the same results but it skipped a lot. If I would draw a straight line , it would be a mostly blank line with a few silver spots. I would not reccomend it."
3,A GEORGE PAL SHOW,"This pack contains 3 items:1) ""The Puppetoon Movie"", a 1980s' compilation-movie on George Pals' puppetoons.2) ""The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal"", a 1980s' documentary on Pal's life and career.3) ""The Great Rupert"" (1950), a family comedy starring Jimmy Durante and a squirrel (both real and in stop-motion animation by, of course, Pal)."
2,Bill Hicks must be better represented somewhere else.,"ARIZONA BAY is my first exposure to the late comedian, and has enough comedy to convince me that any of his other albums is better.The comic momentum here runs out midway and the final Elvis impersonation is like every other Elvis impersonation, and I don't know why it's there. More bewildering is the music. Performers like Joe Frank have used incidental music extremely well as a backdrop to their monologues, while those like Babs Gonzales, the Beat poets and Frank Zappa have brought music into their storytelling. ARIZONA BAY's sonic wallpaper and scene shift music could have been worse than the sincere, smooth-jazz strummings. But once it's on this music stays on. Not only does it run uninterrupted for too long, it persists (loudly) over the next comedy routine. If it's intended to counterpoint Hicks's acid wit, its effect is to drown the humor out. Too loud for ambience, too present to be anything but distraction."
3,What's with the music?,"This CD features some of Hick's most scathing routines, but the music that constantly played in the background did nothing but work as a distraction. Perhaps it was meant to be incidental music, like a movie soundtrack. At any rate, I didn't like it. The music was too dramatic, and tended to overwhelm the Monologues. Without it, this CD would be a five."
3,"Funny, but not as funny as they would have you think","I give Bill Hicks total credit for creating his own unique persona; ditto for bits undiscovered by other comics, but Rant in E-Minor is MUCH, MUCH better. This one suffers from the overlapping guitar fill-ins, which only serve to annoy the listener. If I want muzak, Billy, I'll stand in an elevator."
3,Bad production choices mar the routine,"There are some good moments in Arizona Bay, but the production choices are disappointing. The use of music is entirely inappropriate for the medium. The music between sketches chops up the routine and it loses its coherence. Further, playing loud music while Bill is talking is irritating. Part of the charm of live comedy albums is to hear the audience react with the comedian. There is one woman in the audience, however, who is extremely annoying and obviously drunk. She has a Wicked Witch of the West cackle, and I can't listen to her and Bill at the same time.Because of all the production faux pas, I find it difficult to judge the quality of the comedy. If you concentrate, Arizona Bay is a decent album, but it doesn't compare to Dangerous or Relentless."
4,Catch this priest!,"I picked this one off the New Releases shelf in a local store because I like people who like Vivaldi -- and you wouldn't name a group ""Red Priest"" if you didn't. Here's the deal: If you like Andrew Manze's playing, as I certainly do, than violinist Julia Bishop will knock you out. Even more exciting is recorder player Piers Adams, who is a nutcase on that instrument, bringing it to life with a vengeance. In fact, the only drawback is that I think he goes too far sometimes, but maybe that's a virtue because it contributes to the excitement. I mean, this is a group that even makes music by Telemann sound exciting, and when's the last time you got worked up over a Telemann piece?There's familiar music bere by Vivaldi, Handel, Purcell and Narvaez, and a bunch of short works like Schmelzer's Cuckoo Sonata that I haven't heard before. A wonderful recording."
3,Too many notes!,"This wild and fiery CD is very entertaining -- at first. It gets a bit wearing after listening for 20 or more minutes. The virtuosity is exhausting. As a recorder player myself, I respect the incredible power and technical skill of Adams but there seems a bit of soul lacking in his performance. Has this Red Priest sold his soul for unlimited speed on the ventages? In small doses, however, this CD is hard to beat. (Lastly, Vivaldi was the ""red-haired priest,"" not ""the red priest."")"
4,Beautiful,"I got this album from my girlfriend expecting it to be as good as the single, Lo-Fiction. And at first I thought the album was incredibly awkward in that it didn't know which way to turn whether to be retro-futurist or just something different altogether. But with further listening you begin to hear the subtlety that this album requires. Of course Lo-Fiction is good but you begin to find gems in the John Foxx duet on Dislocation and the lovely sounding StyrkkaritLaukkeeTaas. Definitely worth investing in if you like your electronic music just a touch cool"
4,Great choice for the price,"I have been using this reel to catch everything from Large mouth bass, 8Lb Pike even an 18Lb Carp....It hasn't let me down.I highly recommend it."
4,Tribute Album before the Phrase was Coined!,"Not a tribute to any one artist, but an example of The Bobs' love of popular music. If you like the Bobs, you'll love to hear their renditions of the songs they love. All the songs on this album, have that Bobsian a'capella feel, so don't expect the rock tunes to rock out. One exception is ""Whole Lotta Love,"" which definitely rocks, but for the most part, these songs have different tempos and feels than the originals. If you are new to the music of The Bobs, try ""My I'm Large,"" and listen to their quirky originality. If you like it come back and try this one. The best tune, IMHO, on ""Sing the Songs of..."" is ""You Really Got A Hold On Me."" Very smooth and poignant."
3,Flat Sound,"The songs they are covering are great. The Bobs' arrangements are great. Yet this album just doesn't sound all that good. The sound is pretty flat, not doing justice to the tonal range of the singers. The bass doesn't come through as very bassy. The highs are probably accurately represented though.Still, it's not horrible, just a little disappointing. ""Come Together"" is amazing, and the arrangements on most of the other songs are also impressive and entertaining.I'd recommend you don't pay a fortune to get this new, but get the mp3s or a used copy instead. It isn't going to be the gem of your collection although you may find it enjoyable."
4,We use this one as a summer keep sharp workbook,"This was given to me by a friend.Even though we use it as a summer program, I am impressed with this series. I like how it is broken into weeks and it covers many of the skills each week. Some of our other workbooks are divided into parts (Language arts section, writing section, math section) rather than putting all the skills in a weekly package. I have homeschooled in the past and I can see how this would be a very good lesson plan for homeschoolers, but it is fantastic for summer work too!I will be looking into this series for the future summers for my 3 kids that remain at home."
2,Essie Sugar Daddy nail polish,"I was excited to try this nail polish but was disappointed when it arrived. It is not nearly as thick as the picture makes it look. In fact, it's almost entirely translucent. I piled on 3 coats and I could still see my nailbed through the paint. This polish might make a great top coat for someone but as a stand alone nail polish it is not very impressive."
2,correction of previous review by same author,"I was curious to see if my own slightly negative but objective, fair and even balanced review would be displayed by Amazon. Happily, it is (see above). However, the caveat about my review applying to a previous or no longer available version of the book is NOT true. In fact, there is no way for the editors to know what version I have. Indeed, it is the very same version currently available from Amazon (521 pages, 1989). This seems like a mistake that ought to be corrected, or it is a dishonest way to disclaim my criticism. I would challenge others to refute my claims. I will also think less of Amazon if this is followup is not posted or my original review corrected by removing the erroneous note from the editors."
4,Good extension for a good miter saw stand.,"Bought this extension for the Trojan stand. Works great, no complaints, great ladder design to catch the pieces you cut."
4,women's sexual power daunting,"Speaking as a very sexually frustrated individual, I'm here to tell you that I fear women unleashing the power of eros. Most gang fights are about women -who did whos girl....Leftist academics don't know about all this, although some of them do graduate students because that's all they get...sort of a ""you blank my beep and I'll make sure you get a PhD"" as opposed to the good old fashioned ""do me and the car I'm driving could someday be yours!"" I think it terrible that things have to be this way, but no amount of legislating will prevent Marxist professors from approving their girlfriend's incoherent PhD Dissertations in exchange for moments of ""release"" from the struggle to get more Marxists PhD's so they can take over sociology departments first in GERMANY! TOmorrow IOWA!"
2,An Ideological Reading,"This is not a fair and balanced work of scholarship. Thornton has an axe to grind. If this kind of apologetic for the status quo appeals to you then read Camille Paglia instead, at least she is witty. Kenneth Dover's book is still the best study around and it was written by a heterosexual Oxford don!"
2,AVOID THESE ALIENS,PROS:NONE!CONS:Everything about this movie is awful!SUMMARY: This lame ripoff of ALIEN is totally bad!
1,Wate of Money,"I really had high hopes for this movie...What I got was let down HARD....You can tell from the opening of the title that this is a LOW BUDGET film...I cannot review the whole movie for you because I could not bring myself to watch the whole thing...It really was that bad...It is like a bunch of amatuers tried to make a movie in their basement or a deserted wharehouse and use their computer to make some special effects...There is no chemistry between any of the actors and none of them convey any sort of plausable acting skills that would endear them to the character they are potraying.,,Their all good at cussing. This is just a BAD REMAKE of Aliens 2, which was by far better than this stinker. Save your money, if you really have to have it wait till I put my on sale on Amazon and you can have it for the price of shipping. I hope this helps some of you not make the mistake I made by buying this."
1,Poorly described,"When I purchased this product, it had a picture of 4 stanchions. The description also says ""stanchions,"" which makes you think you're getting more than one. Only one was sent, and since then the photo has been changed to show one stanchion.This is a large, lightweight stanchion that is not a very bright white. In fact, the color is sort of yellowish, like plastic looks when it gets old.I returned this stanchion and got a set of 4 on this site from Beistle Company for $64."
5,A Truly Great Album!,"If Buddy Holly had come of age in the 1990s, he would be playing in King Memphis. This album is a throwback, pure '50s Rockabilly. ""Pumpkin Moon"" and ""Take a Little Piece"" have found their way on about twenty of my Mix CDs. One of my favorite albums of all time. If you like Southern Culture on the Skids and early Reverend Horton Heat, you will love this."
4,KarlBarth,The book arrived on time and in good condidtion. Even though the book was advertised as new - it was used with a few markings in the front. This was not problem - but it was not new. I am enjoying the book.
5,Great Printer for the Money,"This is a great product for the money. I have had absolutely no problems with clogging. I use aftermarket ink cartridges which have equal quality to the orignal ones and save a lot of money that way. The color is excellent. remember if you are printing photos and want superior quality, you need to use photo paper. It is a sturdy workhorse that beats the competition HP, Lexmark, etc. in durability at the same price point.Epson Stylus C86 Inkjet Printer"
2,Great until it stopped working at 14 months,"And labor is so expensive, most shops want $50 just to open it up! My Stylus 740 never had this problem, although the 740 is not a photo printer. At ~$200 it needs to perform better, longer."
1,Pure Junk: Epson Does Not Support It's Products,After 1 and 1/2 years it failed to print. Same problem as many others had. Called Epson. Warranty expired and nothing can be done except send me new cartridges (which of course I had just bought). Stay far away from Epson products. They have planned obsolescence down to a science.
2,2nd bad printer in 3 months,"Maybe I am having bad luck..The first one quit printing yellow and Mag after the first cartridges ran out...Bought new epson ones and ran clean utility probably 10 times.. called Epson and they agreed and sent a new one...Now today it is doing the same thing, ink shows 20% full so to be safe I installed new cartridges all around..No change in color... I will be back on the phone with Epson tomorrow.But when it works it looks great..Perfect quality and color."
1,horribly engineered - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This printer is wonderfully inexpensive and prints beautifully. However, the ink cartridges do not last very long (and the ""recommended"" ones are prohibitively expensive), and the cheap replacement ones you can find on the 'net don't work very well. The paper tray holds about 4 sheets at a time (okay, maybe I'm exaggerating....20 sheets). And the worst? The paper jams every third time you print, wasting time, paper, and ink. And now, for some reason, it won't load a sheet properly, so everything I print comes out lop-sided (and the sheet is bent on one side). I've used Epson and HP printers for years, and this is quite simply the poorest printer I've ever used. I will try to return it, but I've had it for several weeks now, and I don't know if they'll take it back."
2,Dies soon... Good while alive.,"I have had my Epson Stylus C86 since Feb. 2005. (About 2 years) However, suddenly it refuses to print. All the printer does is spit out blank sheets of white paper with no black text. After replacing ink cartridges and spending a lot of money, I am going to switch. I do not recommend buying this printer unless you like products that don't last a long time."
1,Two weeks old and uses too much ink,"Had to replace the black cartridge after a week and a half of light usage. New black cartridge is small and cost $25. Fortunately the old printer is still in the garage and can be brought back. This one is going in the trash when the replacement cartridge runs out. Printer is quiet and prints with good quality.Cost of the printer was low due to rebate so it was not too bad to try comething new even if ink cost is not satisfactory. However, it seems that manufacturers should disclose ink usage rate and capacity before the purchase."
2,Nothing But Trouble ...,"I had to exchange my C86 w/Epson within 9 months. No matter what they had me do to try and 'fix' my problem, it still wouldn't print correctly. I've had the replacement for less than 6 months and the heads are clogged! On-line support sent me an email with a lot of instructions that I followed to the 'T', but the replacement printer doesn't print at all now. I threw away 4 good color/B&W cartridges (half-used) and put in new ones and it still doesn't print! I've paid for this printer about 5x's over now in ink $$$. I plan on using it as a dingy anchor ..."
1,Would rate it zero if I could,"I have the same problem. The printer won't print black ink. Half the time it won't print at all. When it does, the quality of the other colors is terrible. The black ink cartridge is nearly full. This is the second black ink cartridge, and I've probably printed less than 20 pages since I bought this printer. I will never buy another epson product."
5,One of the Best Epson ever made,This is one of the best printers Epson ever made. Ink is relatively cheap. Print quality is very good. No problems at all for this printer.
1,Wish I saw these reviews sooner,"I would not have shelled out for this piece of junk if I knew it would stop working after the 1 year warranty expired.I just shelled out $80+ for new ink cartridges when I knew d*mn well the old ones were not empty in the hopes it would start working again. No luck... just blank page after blank page no matter how many times I clean the heads.Called Epson who told me there is nothing they can do for me. Totally useless.I learned my lesson, no more Epson products for me... ever. This is my first and last epson printer... err, blank page maker."
1,A GOOD CASE FOR A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT!,"I am just one of many burned C86 owners. I have used Epson printers for 20 years. This is my last one. Like everyone else reviewing here, it just-stopped-printing when I changed cartridges one day. Out of warranty by 2 months, so Epson says I'm out of luck, would I like to buy a new printer?!!!!. So now I am down one printer AND the price of an entire set of ink cartridges. GOODBYE EPSON!"
1,stopped working after 9 months,"This printer was fine when it worked, but like everyone else says,the inks stopped printing one at a time, even after replacing them and running all the diagnostics.I replaced it with an hp 5440.don't buy an epson printer- they fall apart FAST"
1,Major Banding Problems within 3 Months of Ownership,"I do not recommend this printer for any type of use. Within 3 months of ownership, the printer head began leaving horizontal lines about every 3 inches down the page. Multiple cleanings and new Epson print cartridges did nothing to solve the problem. I never used generic cartridges, so I am very disappointed that these VERY expensive cartridges do not feed properly through the printer head.I am going to try a Canon or HP next time. In the past, I got rid of my Canon and HP printer because the resolutions improved in the new printer technolgies available in the marketplace, not because my Canon or HP stopped printing properly. I can't say the same for this Epson."
1,A poor return for your investment,"Yes, agreed the epson produces a lovely print when it works. Unfortunately for me, as a relatively infrequent user, the printer decided to give up when the cartridges dried and I ignored it for a couple of months - clog. Now I am left with a printer that has produced no more than 300 pages, a set of new cartridges worth as much as the printer itself and a red flashing light that continues to declare that the ink is low. What an absolute waste of money!! I will be going back to Canon or HP."
3,"Good print quality, but the paper feed is erratic","For the large amount of ink this printer seems to go through, it is gratifying that at least the print quality is more than acceptable.This is the printer I use in my home office, where I seldom print even five pages a day. I am not a novice at using printers, so it is a little bit of a surprise that the machine so frequently refuses to load a page for printing. I stand up, ruffle the paper AGAIN, reload, and usually it prints -- at least by the second or third time of going through these motions.Although my printing volume is very low, it is nice that the machine dependably produces ""client worthy"" documents, even when these include line drawings. Without question this is the best inexpensive printer I have used in that respect. The cost seems to be the speed at which ink cartridges run out. And it would be nice not to have to fuss so much about the paper."
1,CLASS ACTION!,"Epson is facing a class action suit in LA Superior Court. Seriously, check it out. You may be due some money. I recently got notice of this by mail from a law firm. Good!! this product stinks! The civil suit revolves around fraudulant ink cartridge performance. Ive owned two of these turkeys. They do guzzle ink, half full cartridges ""inform"" the printer that they are dry, causing the printer to quit working until you replace the cartridge! If a color cartridge is sending an ""empty"" message, you cannot print a BLACK/WHITE document! It will not let you! Until you replace the color cartridge unnecessarily. Another beef, when printing a b/w photo, it uses some color ink for some reason, I often get a greenish black image! I called Epson help, and they were worthless. I finally got a decent b/w photo by setting the printer for mat paper while actually using glossy paper (Epson paper). Both printers had the same flaws! Don't waste your money on Epson."
1,useless printer,I printed about 4 documents before this printer only began printing every third line. Avoid.
1,Worst Printer Ever,"I have been a big fan of the Epson Stylus series for a long time. They all look great for the money, including this one. However, if you don't print anything for a couple days, be prepared to head clean about a thousand times before you get another decent quality printout. I just wasted almost an entire set of ink cartridges, which are quite expensive, head cleaning and the quality still hasn't improved. I'm ready to throw this printer out."
1,"sucks, what a waste of money and time","My C86 died in less a year, I dont mind paying for a good printer as long as it's reliable. I have paid for ink replacements and the cost was more than the printer. Epson should stop making printers, period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Epson Stylus C86 Injet Printer,"I love the printer. The price was quite reasonable, and the output is superb. I'd recommend it to others."
5,Best printer ever,I bought this as a close out at Radio shack for $49.00 year later works like a charm INK is so cheap for Ebay knock offs its sick..If you buy Epson ink cartridges your pretty much a dope. i guess for Office archive work you might want the Durabright But when you can buy like a dozen Cartridges on ebay for $20.00 man oh man..No other ink is so cheap for knock offs...
1,Why you shouldn't buy this,"I've had 3 printers in my life, a canon, hp, and now this- this by far is the worst- and usually I have to ""do something"" to mess up, but this printer practically volunteers to go awol. The cartridges dry up so quick, and filling them is a hassle and you need special little plugs and if you don't do that you have to buy expensive new cartridges. It seems like ""hey, this is a decent priced printer"" but really the prices of the cartridges is how they cheat you. And you even have to buy a ""resetter"" which is like 20 bucks itself to tell the printer ""hey, I'm dry!"" or they won't even let you use the cartridge. WHAT A HASSLE! You'd save more money and time printing at the library."
1,Finally Giving Up on Epson,"The C86 is my fourth Epson printer. All of them eventually starting clogging up and refused to come clean. My C86 has lasted less than a year. Before it started clogging it was smearing extra ink over anything thicker than flat paper -- i.e., envelopes, card stock, etc. The paper feed on anything other than plain flats would angle off slightly at the git go, so type would come out slanted on the page.Why did I go through four Epson printers before giving up? Great discount prices, and the hope each time that trading up would finally yield a decent printer. Fuggedaboudit. Goodbye Epson. Hello HP."
2,Won't print in B&W unless you buy color ink,"I had generally been very happy with this printer, until I discovered that it won't print in black & white unless your three color cartridges are also filled. There is no override for this ""feature"". So if you need to print something urgently and you are out of, say, yellow ink, you have to go to the store to buy yellow ink before you can print with the black only. A great ploy by Epson to keep you buying their ink..."
3,Another Disposable Printer?,"I bought the C86 because it uses the same ink cartridges as the C84 I have but which pooped out after only 18 months of use and left me with unused cartridges - not cheap to throw away. It's the same printer as far as I can tell. For $95 w/S&H (less $20 rebate) I guess anything working over a year is doing OK. Prints fine, nice features, decent photos, compact design - good for basic home use. Amazon delivered mucho pronto!"
2,Spotty photo performance,"This printer works well sometimes if you use the costly Durabrite paper. Its nozzles clog frequently and Epson's drivers for Mac OS X are horrible. If you're patient enough and are willing to go through lots of supplies, this printer is capable of making good prints. However, next time, I will look for a more reliable and consistent printer from a company with better Mac support."
1,I will never buy another epson printer,"I got the c86 to replace a c82(?) that bit the dust after 14 months or so. This one lasted longer, and I always replace with ""Epson brand inks"" but the last 2 times I changed the black ink, I had to do the clean print heads 10 or 15 times to get black, and today, I can't get any black ink to come out at all. I give up, Epson. Canon, here I come."
5,Epson Style C86 Jet Printer,This is an excellent product. I bought it to replace the C86 I had bought years ago and am completely satisfied with the decision to do so.
2,good price terrible quality of all epson printers.,"I have owned 2 epson inkjet printers, although they have a reasonable, price. Epson figured that he might recovered his money through the ink cartridges cause this things are HUNGRY FOR INK. Plus I have always had that misalightment, thing and head clean problem. Personally I have decided to go with Canon, this time. Since they are more heavy duty, and their ink do last."
2,Printed great until . . .,"I bought this printer and it printed great (good graphics, crisp text) until it started running low on ink. And then everything other reviewers mentioned happened. I bought new and expensive Epson ink (directly from Epson) and it stopped printing. Only blank pages printed, heads would not clean, etc. The warranty obviously expired and tech support was useless simply telling me I needed to clean the heads which the printer would not do. The few service centers Epson seems to have are no where near me and I am not wasting more money on this. After reading the other reviews and finding out this is not an isolated case (but rather common) I'm not only fustrated with my printer but angry at Epson and certainly not buying from them again."
1,ink problems killed it.,having to replace all the (expensive) color ink cartridges to print black and white or do a nozzle cleaning is seriously ridiculous. add the fact that even if you *never* print in color the color ink runs out in a month or so and you've got a deal-breaker.look elsewhere.
2,Ink big problem,"I have never had a printer that runs out of ink so quickly! The replacement cartridges are ridiculously expensive. Next time I buy a printer, I will make sure the ink replacement is affordable. Like some Lexmark printers that let you inject a pack of ink into the cartridge without having to replace the cartridge itself."
1,Poorest printer I've seen in 30 years,"I have a Epson Stylus C86 that I have not printed much with for several months. Initially it worked fine.I did the nozzle check recently, it barely printed a trace. After installing all new cartridges (Epson and expensive) and at least 10, maybe 15 cleanings, it just prints a trace of cyan and a trace of magenta, no black and no yellow. I have only ever used Epson cartridges in this printer.I have had many Epsons over the years, it looks like this is my last. Forums have told me that Epson isn't interested in fixing the problem."
1,What an awful printer!,"I print out maybe 10 pages a month and in the year or so that I've owned this printer, I've already changed the printer cartridge twice. Since cartridges are expensive it's not worth my while to continue using this printer. It also has this awful habit of printing out every other line when the ink cartridge is running low. It's so frustrating because the print quality is quite good when it does work. But such a high-maintenance printer causes nothing but headaches in the long run."
1,Epson sucks,I thought that Epson was pretty good in the beginning but it turned into a nightmare. I am experincing all the FUN cleaning and checking the nozzles/heads...still coming up with the same results...dark lines skipping across the page...funny how all this seemed to start after the warranty ran out...I thought my best friend was joking when she said that the customer service sucked...she tried to call for support...they wanted her to pay...then the support/contact is not toll free...and the WORST was that the help desk was not even in the country. Well I guess I gotta invest in a HP inkjet...didnt have as many problem with my first HP...so I think I'll go back to it. Step your game up EPSON.
5,EPSON PRINTER C86,"If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to today's 3 in 1 printers which require very expensive ink, this is the perfect alternative. Good for certificates, photos and everyday use. Best part: one can order cheap ink from Printpal.com that works just fine. I know, I'm a teacher who has used one for the past 15 years-no problems."
2,Not much to write home about,"I bought mine sometime before Thanksgiving 2005 and have had problems with it now for about three months. Despite repeated cleaning of the cartridge heads and their injectors, the best my printer can do in the way of color these days is a general hot pink cast overall. I suppose I can always pull the color cartridges and use it strictly for black and white, but I'm not impressed."
1,Just Don't,"After eight months of paper jams I've finally had it. I'm going with HP. This has given me nothing but trouble from Day One. Load, clunky, impossible to get the paper properly loaded. Even the popup window to show printing progress is ugly and annoying. Utterly useless! Don't waste your money on this."
3,lots of banding problems.,"I purchased the c86 as a replacement for my old, dysfunctional C84. I have found that printing more than a few pages, be they photos or documents, causes banding. I've wasted what seems like gallons of ink just cleaning and re-cleaning the heads in an attempt to eliminate horizontal lines. And then I waste more time and paper trying to get rid of the ink globs that show up on the print outs. I'm researching a for a new printer now, I think I'll see what HP can offer me this time around.*I have found that optimal photo print performance is achieved with the DURABrite inks and (for my uses) DURABright 4x6 Glossy Photo Paper."
1,Broke after 100 pages,"The feeder broke after 100 pages. On screen, it says I have a paper jam and there is clearly no paper stuck anywhere. Online support doesn't address this problem. Go with another company."
2,Great Printer... for three months,"This printer worked beautifully out of the box, and it was cool that Epson even included some pot paper to test out with it. Then, about three months after buying it, the yellow ink head got clogged. After a quick google search for the root of the problem, I found out that this is an extremely common problem with this and other Epson printers. I contacted Epson since my printer is still under warranty, and they informed me that I would have to either get it fixed myself, or buy a new one."
1,Epson Stylus C86 Inkjet Printer -,"Truly this is a junk printer. I wrote a prior review on how youmight extend its life but today it failed for good. It would notrecognize the ink. Read a review that was posted that a class actionsuit is being filed for the ink part. Good. No matter what I did,the printer could not reconize the ink. Same ink stuff I have been using all along, but not Edson. I threw it away. I had brought a HP Photosmart 8400 HP about 5 months ago, but never took it out of the box.Price was good, customer reviewer were mostly 4 plus starsand I wanted a back up; bought it over Amazon.com . Software CD -it went right in. Pictures and pages are excellent. I won't deal with Epson again."
1,Do not buy EPSON printer,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH THIS PRODUCT. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW DISAPPOINTING THIS PRINTER WAS. IT USED INK CARTRIDGES VERY QUICKLY AND AFTER REPLACING THE FOURTH BLACK CARTRIDGE, THE PRINTER QUIT PRINTING BLACK AT ALL(ONE YEAR OLD). I COULD STILL PRINT VERY FAINTLY WITH SOME COLORS FOR AWHILE. THE COLOR PRINTING QUIT WORKING TWO MONTHS LATER. THIS PRINTER LASTED 14 MONTHS AND I CAN ASSURE YOU AFTER READING MANY SIMILAR REVIEWS ABOUT THE C86 AND C88, THAT WE'LL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER EPSON!"
1,"You may be able to afford the printer, but not the ink","I got this printer free with my last Mac, and it was no bargain. It takes an extraordinary amount of very expensive ink. I rarely print anything but have spent hundreds of dollars for cartridges just to print an occasional letter. Forget it. After this experience, I steer away from anything from Epson, even it is free."
4,bulky ugly paper weight,"normally i research almost everything i buy, however on a whim we decided to buy the epson. what could go wrong? epson is an established name, we have them at work. well just like everyone else, the magic ink fairy that lives inside my printer decided to pack her bags and leave. but not before i droppped 60 bucks on ink refills. this piece of junk printer just decided to stop spraying ink, though paper moves through it fine. no ink flows -black or color. i will *never* buy epson again. i hope you don't either. what crap... just looking at all of the posts about this problem has me wondering if there is cause for a class action suit against epson. run epson run! you have angered us all!"
1,"Yeah, same for me...","I had a C86 for around a year, and got the blank-page problem that everyone else seems to have. Oddly, though, after turning it off for a couple of days, I turned it on and an apparent miracle had occurred. It started working again. Well that bought me several more months, but a few days ago, it went down for the count. The software told its usual lie about nearly empty ink cartridges. Hoping for another ""miracle"", I bought a fresh round of ink, and that turned it into a boat anchor: nothing but blank pages, except for the occasional wisp of cyan. Bottom line, this was a really good printer while it lasted, got good reviews back in December '04 when I bought it. I've noticed most of the bad reviews are from 2006. Lesson learned. Don't buy another Epson. My previous printer was a Canon BJC 4550 that lasted over 6 years, and still worked fairly well when I gave it away. I just bought an HP D4160."
1,I walked out,"Save your money, unless you like gore violence and needless sex it was not my cup of tea, but i am sure there are people out there that would think it was a good attempt at a horror film. It left such a bad taste in my mouth it even made my milk duds sour. Save your money and your time, your stomach will thank you. Don't make any dinner plans before you'll puke, and you sure will not want to go out to eat afterwards, not to mention what the movies says about overseas travel."
4,Haters don't get it...,"There are documented cases of these ""hostels"" existing.so, i guess you could say that the concept is based on true events. This film gives the audience a walk-threw of several young adults, living their lives as carelessly as most usually do...when something happens that (if they live) changes their lives forever. It was an awesome horror movie experience, terrifyingly graphic, and the somewhat passive attitude that suggests ""it's JUST a severed limb...or its JUST an eyeball on her cheek...or it's JUST another humans life"" made the film very darkly entertaining and at the same time, all the more difficult to sit threw. After watching this, i had a similar vibe as to the one i got from watching the original Blair Witch Project. Not really scary, just really creepy atmosphere...and above average acting.The sequel, however, is a different story..."
1,Just plain bad,"The idea for the movie was good, something slightly different from the norm. Other than the main idea, this movie was just plain horrible. It wasn't the blood, guts or violence, the movie had no point to it at all and the plot was insanely stupid. You hate to see a good horror movie idea go to waste, but this movie is just not worth watching."
3,What did you expect?,"This movie succeeded in entertaining me throughout despite some dialogue being cheesy at times. The most frightening thing of all is that you know there are people in the world who would certainly pay to do things like this. I have to knock two stars off because of the stupidity of the main charactors, but I guess you need that to some degree to make a horror movie. What I really don't understand are the reviews that call this pointless and disgusting?? Can I ask these folks what they were expecting? Did you pick up the box at the rental place and think it was Gone With the Wind? If you want to watch an unsettling and slightly disturbing movie you won't be disappointed by this one. If you're looking for 2 hours of riveting plot and charactor development, check out the drama section.Just as an aside, this is not nearly as stupid as Cabin Fever, I was afraid when I saw who directed it but fear not."
4,INTELL&#304;GENT HORROR MOV&#304;E,THE AMERICAN TOURISTS ARE PORTRAYED AS ARROGANT IDIOTS AS THE WORLD SEETHEM.TORTURE SCENES ARE NOTHING COMPARE TO GUANTANAMO.
4,"Intense, creepy thriller with realistic gore and a few let downs.","This was a very dark, intense, and sometimes creepy film, but there really are better horror movies out there. There are a few plot holes in the story that can be annoying while you are trying to believe in it. Most of the gore was done extremely well and looks realistic and sickening, except for one effect near the end (an eye wound) that looked really cheesy and fake to me on the big screen.It's a pretty intense and claustrophobic movie, which I think is what it really set out to accomplish rather than trying to be completely believable or artistic.... so I give it 4 stars for that! After you see this, rent ""Eurotrip"" to calm your nerves!"
1,Hostile Towards Hostel.,"Why? That is the question any intelligent person will be asking themselves after they watch this piece of garbage. Why did they make this movie? It is utterly pointless, devoid of entertainment, joyless, and nihilistic. At least ""Saw"", which this movie is clearly formatted after, had some virtues. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of movies. The story is stupid in so many ways that I cannot even bring myself to describe it. The characters evoke no sympathy and are bland and unlikeable. I write this review to warn potential buyers of this movie that you can't get that two hours of your life back if you watch this movie. If you have read this far you can't say that you haven't been warned."
5,I will set the record straight.,"The are some serious negative reviews floating around here so let me clear this up.Hostel is a very good horror movie...it's that simple. If you don't like horror movies, please don't watch, and review them. A good horror movie must have: good characters, a little mystery, tons of suspense, and a strong ending. These are the qualitys of a good, or great horror movie. Without these, a horror movie is just plain boring. You will not fall asleep watching Hostel. It delivers the promise of being the best horror movie in quite some time. It is very gory(much like the original Texas chainsaw Massacre) and for that I say if you get the shivers watching gross scenes, please stay away from this movie. Creepy atmosphere, disgusting, surprise twists,even a little bit corny. All the things you would expect when you want to see a good horror movie."
1,Terrible,"This movie, along with part 2, is truly pathetic. One of my friends somehow convinced me to watch it, saying it was so much better than part 2, which I saw first. It is no better. It is just gore for the sake of gore. To people who say it has great storyline: no, it doesn't. The storyline is just an excuse to show innocent people be mindlessly tortured. I guess this film is loved by so many people because of all the sick freaks in this world, because seriously, who gets a kick out of this crap? Besides the sickos in today's society. I swear, mental therapists could make an entire living off of one Hostel fan. If you like this kind of thing, you are sick."
3,porn....,"ok, first of all half of this movie is nuthing but porn then the goodies come...if u can stomach slotta gore that is. This movie is really gory and scary.....torture wanted..."
2,Im confused...,"The last time i checked ""Unconfortable"" doesn't mean scary. ""Gore"" doesn't mean scary. ""Violence"" doesn't mean scary. But...horror movies...they're supposed to be scary right? At what point did this movie scare you? It was totally disgusting so yeah at times you almost have to look away. Uncomfortable? yes. Gore? yes. Violence? yes. Scary? NO. A big budget snuff film at best. If you don't hate it...you probably own the ""scream"" collection that sits next to your copy of ""The Grudge"". Get a clue."
1,Absolute trash.,This movie epitomizes what is wrong with human beings. Anyone who is entertained by seeing people tortured and horribly murdered is sick and in serious need of a psychiatrist.
1,ZRODN,"man what a terrible dysfunctional film. i myself weightlift am strong and mentally sound but dam i left seeing this film started to doubt myself and very angry. the way this snuff film the torture seen pull the eyeball of the victim out whats up with that, i mean we all know people sell their assess but sell them for a torture club hell no. the film was made in a way to inspire anger in civil audience types or idealist such as myself. i am completely jaded. when you see this film see it with a counselor and friends and make sure when you see it all your friends are strong and viable or packing because when you leave seeing this film you dont want to see any weakness around you thats how much anger this film brought out its like so negative and somehow jades you momentarily. i mean if the god dam aliens landed right now there would be no response from me because i felt after seeing this film i seen the abyss whats next."
3,Where are my fingers? Oh look. A guy with a chainsaw.,"Hostel is a pretty good movie from the director (Eli Roth) of the crappy Cabin Fever. Almost like a snuff movie, Hostel has lots of European female nudity and bucket loads of violence. If you like these two, this movie is for you. Torture scenes are well done with some realism (despite the fact Hostel only cost 4 million), but I had hoped for more violence and torture. Hostel also has a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. From a woman getting run over by a car and a gang of dangerous children smashing in a guys head with a brick.Overall, Hostel is an enjoyable watch and I would recommend anyone to try it out."
1,Ew this movie was terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay. I did not go see this movie in the theater. I have waited months to see this movie because everyone said it was soo good and disturbing. This movie sucked so bad. I am seriously disappointed. The best part of the whole movie was when the guys were trying to get laid. The whole ""scary"" part was soo bad. It was not disturbing , gruesome, or intense at all. I felt like they were in a really cheesy haunted house. I really expected more from a movie that was produced by Quentin. Milo and Otis is more disturbing than Hostel."
1,This movie is not good,"This movie is about Drugs,hooking up with girls,and drinking,and something else I rather not say.If I was you I do not recomend you to buy this movie.Jay Hernandez is a very good actor but this movie was not for him at all.This movie does not make any sense what so ever.He goes to the country to hook up with girls,take drugs and drink and then gets caught in a thing he was not supose to.A torture chamber but that part is at the end for about 30 min of the movie and thats all.So to me this movie really sucks,I do not get it at all.But if you buy it its a waste of money.If you buy it that you this is just what I thing about Hostel....."
1,Yuck,"There was no story to this movie. It was gory and disgusting, just for the sake of being gory and disgusting. If you want a good, gory movie, watch any of the ""Saw"" films.I could have lived the rest of my life without seeing Hostel."
1,bobby standlee,I am a tarentino fan. there was nothing in this movie that related to his work. I am an avid horrow fan. I was realy dissapointed with this movie. The horrow scenes were good that were in it but they were few and far between. I bought this movie and watched it. I am going to put it on the selling block as soon as I get done here. I rate this movie as awful. Don't waste your money. Go to the movie store and buy Sin city. Now that is a great movie.
4,Bloody great time!,What else would one want in their horror movies. This one had the graphic violence and gore. It also had Cinemax late-night soft-core porn for most of the first half. Ain't nothing wrong with that.
2,It was ok...,"It wasnt really all that good, it was more of a soft corn porn...and not enough glore or torture like you think it would be."
2,No balance,"Three young men travel by train to Eastern Europe, Slowakia if I recall well, and are kidnapped from the hostel they're staying. When they awake they find themselves tied down to a chair facing a sadistic maniak who is in a surgery mood. Sofarthe film is looking good, but then the director finds it necessary to show all torture scenes in the most explicit wayhe can think of. If you are really into sadistic violence you will enjoy all kinds of body parts getting chopped of, but if you are not, you may also think that the director should have left a little bit more to the viewer's imagination.Still the movie has a few strong moments....it is a shame the movie is kind of missing its balance. If Quentin Tarantino was truly connected to this movie, he would have noticed this as well. (SARR)"
2,Just a heads up.,"I don't right reviews but, I was VERY disappointed with this movie in the theaters and want to give people that still haven't seen it a quick heads up.It is a horror movie plain and simple. People that went in looking for plot and meaning obviously didn't watch the commercials or make note of the director.BUT, by watching the commercials it was also built up to be one of THE MOST horrifying and shocking movies of its kind due to the GRAFFIC torture scenes.In my opinion, none of these is true. The idea was there, but it visually failed. Everything is a cutaway or the actual torture is blocked by the subjugator or it is just alluded to by shadows. I wanted my money back.I saw it the Wednesday after it was released and I heard rumor that after the first weekend it was edited. .........This is why I will purchase the unrated version in hopes that it will redeem itself."
2,oh my!!!!,i didn't like this movie its so kadiri!!!!!!.... people killing people just for fun??? ewh!!!!!!! but if you dont have any choice this movie would be your last option....its so panget!!!!!
3,This movie was okay,"I was the first and only of my friends to see this movie...it was okay I guess, I only really cared for ONE of the actors, Jay, who played Paxton. Other than him I really did not care for anyone else. the first time I saw this (when it was in theatres) I thought it was great, but then again...I thought EVERYTHING was great haha Back then I'd get pissed and most of the time juset watch a super gory, blood-spilling, movie to get my anger out so every movie I saw with tons of blood, I'd say it's good. But I agree with one of the people who wrote a review, SOOO MANY DUMMIES THAT IF U LOOK CLOSE AT, LOOK VERYYY FAKE!!! This movie is okay and is a movie that SHOULD of come straight to DVD and should of been in the $3.99 box at walmart or something, it's worth a watch, not a buy."
3,And The Whole Point Was ???,I saw this movie in the theater the day that it came out. The whole point of the movie basiclly is about a group of college kids that go to amsterdam in search of a good time but instead a bunch of other stuff happens it was so far fetched violence wise the i could not stop laughing and at the part where the woman gets her eye torched and all that stuff starts comming out i just about choked on the root beer but anyway if you want a movie filled with cheap gore and lots of sex than you will probably like this
1,Worst movie ever,"Poor excuse for a film. Not at all a horror film, an exploitation film if anything. I have no idea how this piece of garbage made its way into the theaters. Waste of time! Little gore, stupid story, bad acting, and tons of cheap sex scenes. Ridiculous! I would have given no stars if possible."
1,Badly Flawed With A Ton Of Wasted Time,"This film finds its best moments in the opening credits, before the title ""Hostel"" ever hits the screen. After that point, it is a quagmire of useless, non-relevent, sex-scenes and expressions of drug use. After trudging through the first half of the movie, dealing with unrelated mentionings about the female anatomy, one hopes the movie will reach a higher standard and show the horror that was promised. The only horror here, is the filmaking itself. While the premise behind the movie is an interesting idea, the filmaker seemed too busy with style over imagery and symbolism over substance. The film never scares the viewer. It even falls short of being anything disturbing. A true waste."
1,HOSTEL (TORTURE ENOUGH JUST TO WATCH IT),"ok yeah this is my opinion.. and you know what they say about those..but yeah.. IF you've ever wondered what would happen if you let a few [...]little 12 year old boys write a horror movie and give them a decent budget.. well this is what happens..let's see.. I think their list of what they wanted to see was..NAKED GIRLS NAKED GIRLS FUNNY JOKE NAKED GIRLS NAKED GIRLS THEN LET'S CUT SOMEONE EYE OUT, NAKED GIRLS NAKED GIRLS, CUT A FINGER OFF END!that's me putting it in decent terms.. I thought this movie was a good idea and could have been way better if the guys who made saw had taken the reigns.. BUT alas they let the idiot who did the other movie that was horrible CABIN FEVER do it.. hell TARANTINO should have had full control.. it would have been better..but oh well.. If this had been sold as a comedy.. PORKY'S STYLE goof it would have been better to me..oh well"
1,zzzzzzzzzz,"it took me 4 times to stay awake, granted the nude girls were nice but why waste you money, just rent a skin flick, this movie was another attempt to scare people with blood and gore, I would have gave it a -8 stars if the rating system would let me."
3,A sick little movie,What a sick concept but compelling nonetheless. The movie's plot (backpackers looking for adventure) is a pretext for absolutely disgusting torture scenes. But you can't turn away as the film takes you on a journey into a nightmarish world of depravity.
2,Pointless,"As enough people have pointed out already, this movie is painfully pointless. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot but I feel the end ruined the movie. The plot keeps you interested to get to the end. There's plenty of female nudity and blood for all the guys out there. I prefer a movie with some kind of depth to it, not pointless slaughter."
2,wasnt worth it,i heard about this great movie that was grizzly and bloodly but it wasnt anything that i expected it to be. It was an ok movie but dont expect anything special from it...
3,Harsh Horror,"Hmmmm...I was between 2 and 3 stars on this one. As a ""scary"" movie, it's pretty harsh to watch. There were no jump out of your seat moments, or scenes where I was so scared I had to watch the movie from beneath my afghan. It was just harsh. The three lead guys are unlikeable, and so are the skanky girls they pick up. Because of the darkness of the film the moments that could have been somewhat humorous are just gritty (like the roaming band of murderous children).The ""gore"" is left up to the imagination, as the film more alludes to images than lets you see them. I couldn't decide if there was some sort of message about the depravity of the very wealthy and the helplessness of the poor, a commentary about...something, or if this was just a gross movie for the sake of being gross. Tough call.Not a moive I will watch again any time soon, but I am not sorry I saw it either (unlike say, The Hills Have Eyes...)"
3,"Great Idea, Sickening, disturbing but Average","This movie comes with its up's and down's, the storyline is realistic and twisted, in the sense of a good scary horror it hit's the spot. The cast is full of fresh new faces, but it lacks something that could had made it a truly brilliant movie. Some scenes are just pointless and stupid, and while the other scenes in which you are supposed to shock you, lets just say the climax only goes half way. The characters in which you are supposed to feel sorry for, it just happens to soon, which makes you not really give a crap.Still I do love the idea, I can't say it was a poor attempt at this movie idea in which two backpackers traveling through Europe find themselves as victims in the under world where anything has its price."
4,Super! I loved it,"Excellent direction. Superb sets and locations. Average acting but very good looking women. I wasn't expecting much from this film cause I didnt hear a big round of praise for it. However, I felt this film got better with every passing minute. Hostel is an intense tense film. It is probably the most bloody film I have seen but what I liked more about the film was it's edge of the seat disorderly unconscious screenplay. I must say it was worth my time. Watch this film if only you think you can stomach it and not be a short attention span dilletante. This is not like Saw and it doesn't try to be SAW. Is it better than SAW? Despite the difference in genres, NO. Anyway, watch it, forget what critics say.Cheers and two fingers,A much satisfied viewer"
3,Not quite what they were calling for,"Though Hostel was supposedly chocked full of gratuitous violence I still felt that it was lacking something in the violent gruesome scenes. The suspense was somewhat lacking, it was more of a cat and mouse chase towards the end of the movie, with the somewhat obvious ending. Though it does have some realisitc potential the movie leaves the watcher somewhat unattached throughout the film, not quite reaching that ultimate climax. Hopefully the unedited version will satisfy the horror movie thrill seeker movie goers a little more."
1,this movie could have been condensed to one hour and still be long and drawn out,"hostle is the kind of movie that make you think,about how many stippers that it would take to make this slow and drawn out movie worth watching. the entire movie could have been condensed into an episode of tales from the crypt and still it would have drawn on id recommend the devils rejects or i spit on your grave if you want a good horror\explotation movie"
2,Not Scarey,"Ok I'm a very big Horror movie fan,Saw, Saw 2, Texas chainsaw ect....This wasn't scarey, it was slightly gross... in places. But the movie trailer leads u to belive the whole movie is gross which it isn't.The whole 1st hour is a waste. I mean yes you get to know the characters and feel for them but how bad can you feel for guys going to hook up with girls to just have sex? HAHAOverall it was worth watching. I wouldn't buy it though. Wait for cable.It did also have a twist at the end... it should have been talked about a few minutes more.And the end there is a justified action. Which was a nice ending."
1,Painfully bad - though it could have been really good,"THIS MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERSThis movie was three parts:1. Some young American guys and their zany friend being stereotypical horrible and rude tourists just trying to hook up - 40 minutes.2. The time spent in this cool, torture 'hostel' - 10 minutes.3. A getaway/chase scene - 30 minutes.Not only was the only cool part only 10 minutes, but they barely touched on why these people do this. The only hint that they gave towards one character is because he is a closeted [...]. It was just ridiculous. It was a let down because it could have been good."
1,BIGGEST DISAPPOITMENT OF THE HORROR GENRE IN 2006!!!!!! HOSTEL UNRATED DVD REVIEW,"Seen this movie a while back and it was extremely wretched and futile. Quentin what are you doing? I can name a couple of straight-to-DVD horror films that were better than this. Don't AGREE WITH ANY OTHER REVIEW EXCEPT FOR THE ONE STAR REVIEWS!OH WAIT, I WAS GOING TO MAKE A TITLE FOR SPOILERS BUT THIS MOVIE ISN'T WORTH WATCHING AT ALL SO...THERE IS ONLY ABOUT TEN-ELEVEN,ETC. MINUTES OF TORTURE SCENES.I CANT BELIEVE THE PREVIEW MADE IT LOOK LIKE THERE WAS AN ARRAY OF TORTURE THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE!!!THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO SCARY PARTS IN THIS MOVIE AT ALL!!A WOMAN GETS AMPUTATED AND.. WELL YOU HAVE TO SEE.THE SAME WOMAN JUMPS IN FRONT OF A TRAIN BECAUSE HER FACED WAS MESSED UP. WHAT IS THAT?MOVIE DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT THE END!!!WHAT IS WITH THE KIDS? VERY DEFICIENT!IN CONCLUSION, I WAS NEVER DISAPPOINTED TOWARDS ANY OTHER HORROR OR ANY OTHER MOVIE IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF GENRE EXCEPT FOR THIS!!!"
3,Spring Break Gone Bad!,"Horny college kids travel abroad to find hot chicks and in the first half of the movie they do find hot chicks...and in the 2nd half they find torture and death.Director Eli Roth ripping off The Most Dangerous Game premise where the rich pay to kill and upping the horror cliche ante of sex leading to death...now it leads to graphic mutilation then death.Hostel is undeniably trashy,not very scary but it's also a lot of fun in a sleazy way.Like The Man Show this film seems specifically geared toward men and is an effective nasty little B-movie.Unlike Saw there are no clever games so it takes very little brainpower to enjoy this film.A likable cast,a wicked sense of humor,nice use of forgein locations,some good gore and an unapologetic immoral approach are what elevate Hostel over safer big budget Hollywood flicks.Not great art but it is great fun."
2,Boring Untill the Last Half....,"I'm a huge horror movie fan, for me the gorier the better. So, I picked up a copy of Hostel on DVD. The first half of the movie, in my opinion, was boring as hell. The first half consisted of talking, sex, talking, sex, talking...did I mention sex? If I wanted to see so much sex I'd watch a porno flick. I like horror movies that start right away, and have gore throughout. This movie seriously lacked the action through the first hour of the movie. On a more positive note, the last 35 minutes of the movie caught my attention. So, my advice: Skip to chapter 18 on the DVD and watch the last half. There are chopped off body parts, an eye popped out, and blood everywhere. If you're like me and love gore, you'll probably find the first hour of this movie a big bore, but will be entertained by the last half hour."
3,"'tis a real eye opener, Jim lad!","After the big lie of Spielberg's 'Munich', it's nice to get back to a movie that tells it like it is. However, the soundtrack is clearly wrong for the film and constantly works against it. Take that out completely and you have a perfect dead pan comedy gem."
4,Strangers on a Train MEETS The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"Now, I knew not what to expect when I purchased this film, but being a fan of horror, I decided to give it a go. At first I was disappointed to find that it was written by the creator of ""Cabin Fever""--a film that I wish I could erase from my movie-going memory. But ""Hostel"" tries to break all the rules and it delivers in that regard. I would only recommend it to DIE hard fans of the genre, especially if you have a penchant for gore. This movie has wall to wall blood and guts. It even evokes some Hitchcockian elements with Americans loosed in a Slovakian country where the characters surrounding them are not on the level. At times, the film is so gratuitous with both sex and violence, that you almost roll your eyes at how unbelievable it is. Yet, the reasons for why the gore occurs is a probable (and profitable) theme that could happen in reality. That's what makes the movie all the more terrifying."
4,"just for the movie, havent seen the dvd yet","ok, while i will admit that there were obvious things wrong with the movie, the ""wrong"" things were overshadowed by the good things. this is one of the most disturbing movies ive seen in awhile, and believe me, it takes alot to disturb me. this movie actually made me uncomfortable. and i havent felt uncomfortable watching a movie since i was a teenager. so the movie's gotta be doing something right. it was vicious, and i dont use that word lightly. i rarely use that word to describe anything. the torture scenes were just downright brutal, and though it actually made me cringe, i HAD to enjoy it. anything that provokes a good reaction like that is worth something, really. i have yet to see the dvd, and hope that the unrated version is even MORE vicious. i did note though, that while the title for it says, ""unrated edition"", the ratings-thing still puts it as ""rated R"". is this a typo, or am i just not comprehending this correctly?"
3,"Good effects, but doesn't save the film.","I must admit, Hostel had amazing effects. The before-and-after of the people being tortured were simply billiant. However, the movies isn't as advertised. It isn't very scary; no jumpy scenes. It's just like pornography the first forty-five minutes of it, as the guys explore what Amsterdam has to offer them. The,n they stumble upon two girls, who end up being apart of the plan. I think it's nice how it all unravels to where everybody they met were involved in this torture somehow, but what it's about doesn't really fit the screenplay: The movie summarized is about a bunch of college guys going to Amsterdam looking for a good time, and end up being part of a legal torture chamber where people pay to torture helpless, innocent victims. To me, the movie is mostly on the good time in Amsterdam subject. The,n it gets gruesome. Overall, I found the movie average, but the make-up effects above-average; brilliant, brilliant, brilliant."
5,Pissed off,I dont understand the 1 star reviews.. This is a horror movie people mayb you should watch more of the genre before u pan this.END
2,dark and disgustingly good,"good movie for the non-squeemish. You have to stetch your imagination a bit at times, and remember the ""good old days"" of teen flicks for other times, but overall not bad at all."
1,What the hell!,"The previews did not show too much about this movie, so I rented this movie without fully knowing what it was about. If guys were in the movie, and were naked and did perverse stuff like those ugly girls did, the movie would have been rated X! Do those girls have low selfasteem or were they desperate for money? I'm so sick and tired of seeing nacked girls in movies after movies. I guess the movie industry only cares about catering to young immature guys with no taste then anything else. AVOID THIS MOVIE!"
1,youd think tarantino directed this....,"This movie got so much hype behind Tarantino as producer, and reviews as the scariest movie ever [the 10000 film to claim this], that it is a wonder it did not get an Oscar.The film is overambitious, and unlike Roths' simple Cabin Fever. A 2nd time director, he benefited from increased budgeting. The plot is described elsewhere, but basically people are kidnapped in East Europe, and tortured for entertainment. Sexy vixens lured them with sex, and they are then kidnapped. The 'vixens' are the most interesting perhaps, as most of the tourists are too bland to register.A must miss."
1,a huge dissappointment,"This movie has stereotypical characters, a weak plot, and basically uses the names attached to it to get any kind of attention. Not only was this movie bad in terms of Quentin Tarantino, but a just plain bad movie."
1,Disgusting and terrible,I have not seen this but everyone i know that has said it was messed up. My aunt who likes horror movies a lot bought this and burned it the same night in the fire where it belongs. My other aunt went to rent it and the guy working there said it was a terrilble soft core porn. Both my friends told me that it was screwed up(not their exact wording just too offensive for here)I saw cabin fever and almost vomited after seeing it. It had no story line. I have no want to see this. i would give it a 0 if i could. Disturbing
1,Terrible !!!!,"I bought this film a couple of weeks ago and i was highly disappointed. Don't buy this film, keep your money"
3,both more and less than i thought it would be,"great idea . pretty good story telling . some flawed prosthetic work (the lovely japanese girl) . yeah , that was the point at which the picture kinda derailed for me a pretty fair bit . i thought the acting was uniformly quite good .the ease of our hero's escape strained credibility a good measure also . oh , and the street urchin flip/flop was silly as well . glad i saw it to judge for myself . glad we had a likable and winning protagonist . satisfactory . i liked MR. ROTH'S CABIN FEVER a bit more . i'd recommend both to folks with strong stomach's ."
3,"Eh...okay,","This movie was fun, but I wouldn't watch it again. The trip through Europe is cool and the European chicks are hot. Pretty gruesome scenes, but nothing deeply terrifying. The scene with Josh is pretty freaky, and he's a good screamer. I liked the crazy guy towards the end of the movie who asks, ""what it's like?""This film kinda makes a person wonder if these types of hunting clubs really exist. Now THAT'S a scary thought.If you want real gore with a lasting psychological impact, skip the fictional horror in this flick and others, and go rent any of the Faces of Death movies."
4,Good movie !,"It will be short and sweet. Pretty good movie, the second DVD has great stuff. A must for any horror movie fans !"
2,Mediocre,"This is as far from ""one of the best or perhaps the best thrillers of all time"" as you can get. Wanna see a really great, suspenseful thriller? Try David Lynch's Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive. This isn't it. It's extremely typical, geared towards gore hungry audiences while not really being extremely gory. The best part of the entire movie were the girls (I'll admit, that alone may be worth the ticket price), but don't expect anything extremely original here. This is basically Saw (which was much better) with a location change and more people involved in making it happen. Long story short, a rental at best."
4,Good stuff.,"Its bloody, gory, and full of nudity. What else can you ask in a horror movie? If you want a good horror experience go for this. The sequals are crap though."
5,HOSTEL (Movie),Got this 2 days after i ordered! played great & the packaging was also great..it was NEVER opened. I would definetly order from this person again (:
3,Did I miss something?,"Am I crazy? Probably. When I originally rented ""Hostel"" several years ago, I found it gory, visceral, disturbing, and not-too-soon forgotten. I do not have the ability to compare that version against the copy I purchased, the ""Director's cut"", but the director's cut seemed shorter, and had much less of an impact on me. If anyone has any solid info on this, I'd be interested to know, is it true, or is it just me?"
3,MUCH Scarier The First Time Watching,"The first time I watched this movie, I was scared out of my mind. It was sickening, I almost couldn't handle it.However, I rewatched it a few minutes ago and it's not half as scary as it was the first time. It actually became rather humorous since in the end there's a lot of irony to be had. So not so scary or horrific the second time watching it.I'm very sure what's shown in this movie has happened and is still happening in some parts of the world, maybe even in some parts of the US for all we know. People go missing all the time, in many countries it's not even a big deal. ""Oh you lost your daughter? Just have another one...""The human species is more naturally prone to violence and negativity, we have to actually work hard to not be.Re-watching this movie, I noticed a ton of flaws I didn't notice much the first time due to being so scared. Do guys typically act this watch around each other? I hope not, I'm a guy and I find the typical a bit insulting."
3,MORE PORN THAN TERROR 6.5 OUT OF 10,"Hostel is definitely one of those movies that no matter what kind of parent you are, this movie is in no way appropriate for kids at all. My big complaint against this movie is the fact it focuses more on pornography than the purpose it's suppose to serve... to scare you. While it's always gratifying to see naked chicks, this movie takes it too far to the point of where you just get tired of looking at them(I've seen enough movies with this already). The gore and level of violence is definitely disturbing and it will really gross you out. It never scared me because I've seen enough horror movies to know what will probably happen, so that partially ruined the experience as well. The characters are basically a group of foul-mouthed people or they are mentally disturbed which didn't really pull me into the storyline either. And the nudity involving the dudes? What was up with that? Seriously folks, it's really nasty."
4,worth ticket price,"Awesome film, not as sickening as I feared, but gruesome scenes and people's personalities abound. After reading the reviews here, I thought the 2 main male characters would be dislikable, but I didn't get that at all. I felt terrible for them and was AMAZED at the ending. See it. You won't forget it for a while."
1,Meaningless Gore Fest,"Every once in a while a movie comes along which breaks new ground in its genre...a movie which delivers memorable sequences, both visual and auditory. A film for the ages. Sadly, this is not one of them. This is a film shot on a shoestring budget with no name actors and whose only purpose is to shock the audiance with ""See, look how much gore I can put on the screen...and get away with it"". This is quite simply a movie reflecting the basest of attitudes by some movie producers and directors. The fact that Quentin Tarrentino is somehow treated as a wonderful contributer to cutting edge movies doesn't speak well for those who actually buy tickets to see this drivel. Fortunately, I paid only a small rental fee and was still upset that I even paid that. If you really want to see gore, join the military and ask for duty in Iraq. There, it's real and stomach churning. Otherwise, spend your money on something worthwhile."
3,Somewhat Disappointed.......,"I just finished watching Hostel. Being a horror movie fan and having heard alot about this movie, I couldn't wait to watch it. I was somewhat disappointed because the first half of the movie was quite boring and pornish. Now, the second half of the movie I have to say was Cool. Cool gore scenes although I heard the movie was much sicker and gorier than it really was. Kind of a Chainsaw Massacre and Saw ripoff. I would have expected better from Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth. I'm not sure if there was a ""rated"" version of the film. I bought the Unrated version. If the rated version was cut down, then I'm sure it would have gotten a 2 star rating from me. If the whole movie would have been like the 2nd half, it would have been a great and cool horror film....... but, I'd suggest horror fans renting it and forward to the 2nd half of the movie!!"
5,Entertaining Movie,"I thought that this movie was very entertaining. I don't think that it was scary though. There are just a couple of torture scenes. But, don't let this be the reason to not watch the movie.Overall, this is a good movie, and a good story. It is a good story because it is realistic - a couple of college boys going off to Europe to have fun, end up in a weird town, meet up with some cute girls, and become the unwilling victims in a scheme where weirdos pay big bucks to torture and kill other people.Also, I think that anyone who watches this movie will be very satisfied with the ending, because what comes around, goes around.You will definitely root for the hero in this movie when you see him handing out justice left and right."
4,HOSTEL THE MOVIE,"THIS IS IT,THE HOSTEL SICKEST FILM IVE SEEN IN TIME,,,,,,,,heavy ,,, brilliant ......sjdamir@yahoo.com"
3,About 20min were really good,"I was disappointed by this film. It starts out with three sex crazed, homophobic bigots, who you can't wait to see die. And that seems to go on for hours. Then you get to the horror stuff which was really excellent. The whole look of the torture chamber was perfect and the torturers were very creepy.After that...it turns into a comedy and I don't know why. Going more for laughs than screams. Once the hero frees himself he has little problem escaping and knocking off the villains one by one. And once the kids were stomping on the guy's dead skull I was really rolling my eyes. It goes from creepy horror to total corn ball."
1,"Ashamed That This Was an ""American"" Film","I am sure that Eli Roth will be remembered for being one of the worst film writers and producers of American cinema. This is a shameful display of sheer stupidity and scatological retardation, the only ""art"" that Roth apparently can produce.What angers me more is how celebrated this piece of vile trash of a film is by all your mental midgets out there, cheering on the violence with glee, and perhaps in so doing inspire some to follow through it. Perhaps such violence will befall you or a love one. If that day shall come, think back on this film that you so delighted in and see if you cheer then for violence.This film is an affront to all that is worthy of life and a paramastabatory mindless act of deficating in public and then celebrating it with joy."
1,IT SUCKED,"This movie was by far the worst movie I've EVER seen. The first 25-30 minutes was boring, then the rest was all the just blood going everywhere, people screming, eyes being ripped out of peoples heads, and people being burned and drilled through. I would not suggest this movie for anyone, unless they are completly screwed up in the head."
4,Insanity.,"The movie is extremely insane and sick. I only recommend it for people who like really extreme horror. Three college guys go to Europe and stay at a hostel in Slovakia where they are kidnapped and tortured. That pretty much says enough. And another thing. I don't know what EvilAngel007 mean't that this does happen, but the movie is made up. Eli Roth saw a Thai website that said you could shoot a villager in the head for 10,000 dollars. He said he didn't know if it's real or not. That inspired him to make the movie. There is no international murder market. That's for sure."
3,"Good,but there were some issues.","This movie was alright for the most part, but I guess I'm too stubborn to watch the SAW movies over again. This movie just reminds us of SAW,but with less gore."
4,More Impressed After Buying,"When I first saw Hostel in the theatre, I was a bit taken back that it seemed more like soft core porn than a horror movie. The entire 1st half is basically filled with nude women, and sex.However, after watching the movie a few times, it really makes sense the way it was put together.Definately not for folks who can't handle blood, guts, and oozing open wounds! Great effects, and great story line. It's hard to believe places like this really exist in the world.I love the twist at the end - sweet justice is always a perfect ending."
3,LOVED IT..BUT STILL NOT THAT GREAT...,"I am glad this film was made , it will open the door for more horror films to be released in the mainstream with good budgets. The movie was good the story was good, i loved watching it once, but since the first 45 minutes has nothing but character development, i don't think i could watch the whole thing again, just the second half. The whole pay to torture somebody idea was great ,,, you will never run out of enemies for sequels.the movie has too much beginning,,,,,"
3,Predictable,"something about hosel just gave me deja vu all over again. man hunting man has been done so many times in so many capacities, that when the gore finally came around the bend it was neither shocking nor surprising.the film itself gave so much foreshadowing and obvious oddities surrounding the disappearance of various characters it made the coming scenes easy to anticipate and added to my notion that all the characters were idiots.that said, it still held my attention and had overall good pacing. you'll probably see the twist coming from a mile away, but it's a fairly frightening concept none-the-less.personally, i am sick of horror films that are staged in one or two settings. hostel tried to reach beyond, but came up short.a truly unique look at torture can be found in the film ""audition"""
2,"well, here we go again","My friend had told me about a movie, a movie which was so disturbing and graphic that he had almost puked........ and this was that movie. I had rented it a few weeks later. I heard people talking about it being a Quentin Tarantino film, but when I had looked on the box I noticed that it was just presented by him and that it was directed by Eli Roth, knowing his previous work Cabin Fever I knew that this DVD was going to be nothing special....... and thus I was correct. This movie is basically like one of those SAW ripoff movies that promise you blood and gore, but give you a ""gruesome noise"" or a moment where they almost show him clipping off the toe of the girl when the camera quickly cuts to the next scene........ boring."
1,Should get 0 stars,"Horrible movie,very poor acting & weak script very predictable.I got this movie thinkin well if Quentin Tarantino had anything to do with it this should be good.But I was way wrong this is one of those movie where you see the trailer you think wow this will be awsome.But basiclly all your seein is the best parts of the movie.Don't waste the time or money it's 94 min you'll never get back & you'll feel alot smarter for not watching."
3,Alright,"The movie was like this: first part was sex and drugs, second part was a nice little mystery, and the final part was were all the gore came in. I didnt find the movie very gory, so I don't know what all the hype about the movie is. Its too bad they have to make a sequel for this movie."
1,Don't waste your time...,"A review is just an opinion, mine just so happen to agree with most of the 1-star people: QT did NOT have anything to do with this movie other than put his name on it (kind of like the ::cough:: ""trump"" buildings in Florida). In addition, I walked out angry as well, my girlfriend seemed to be ammused while I felt it was a waste of my money, time, and my mood. There really wasnt a plot; just sex and gore. So much so that it seemed like it was an appeal to sex/gore fans to make money on low budget. Im not going to go on further.. It was entertaining at a minimum, therefore I gave it 1 star (and not 0)"
4,MR. SERIOUS AMERICAN,"When I saw the movie at the flea market for a buck, I said, ""What the heck, it's Tarantino presents."" I had trouble following the movie due to a lack of confusing flashbacks (It's a joke.)Three guys are touring Europe doing guy things. They meet a man who tells them about a Hostel in a small isolated town in Eastern Europe where there is an overabundance of pretty women who have nothing better to do than to throw themselves at anyone with a foreign accent, and they love all Americans. When they get there (note ""Pulp Fiction"" on TV) it is true. Women who look like models unashamedly share sleeping quarters with men, give them drugs and have sex with them.One by one the men disappear (as do the Japanese girls) and are tortured to death, aka ""Blood Sucking Freaks"". Paxton (Jay Hernandez) the last of the trio demands to know where his friends are... The slaughterhouse was filmed at an actual mental hospital in Prague.Clearly not for everyone.Sex, nudity, f-bomb, torture."
3,Eh,"For all the hype this movie got, it wasn't as good as I expected. When I went to the theater to watch it, I expected to be on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was called the scariest, most gory movie of the year. But I did not think it was scary or gorry. The parts that were supposed to be ""gorry"" were sad attempts. The plot was also weak. There was very little that was exciting or scary about this film."
3,More of a gore movie than a horror movie..,"I never really got any sort of adrenalin boost from the film. The plot was more focused on drama and gore than unexpected action.The movie started out really great. Oli had a lot of strength as a character but the movie had a rough transition from three European backpackers into a slaughter fest. It didn't transition smoothly in my opinion nor was there any particular climax to the movie. It plateaued with minimal suspense and just stayed at that level before cresting down. I think if the movie had some sort of CONTEXT and REASON for the events then it would have been more enjoyable.It was, however, a film about depravity in all sorts of graphic ways. The detailed, intimate portrayl of human torture had an element of realism to it that made it uncomfortable to watch at times, unlike movies like Saw I & II.I was not terribly impressed with this movie. It was more a documentary on torture than an actual dramatic, titillating horror film."
2,Just Bad,"I had heard that this movie was 'smart' with all these 'deep political overtones' so I said to myself: great, I've enoyed the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Saw series, this will probally be like that.But no, no my friends I was wrong. The movie has no discernable plot untill halfway through when you come to realize everyone is on setting these guys up to be tortured and killed. Why? becasue of they are Americans.Seriously, all that happens is the guys get messed up, get laid and get killed with (of course) the one guy surviving and taking revenge on the perps.Come on people, this is not brilliant, its lame, boring and gruesome to make up for a mighty thin plot. Thinner than the laughable pre-teen muggers in the film!Avoid unless you want to see extremely nasty scenes of torture for no appartant reason."
3,"Comfy, suave shoe but made for gorilla feet!","This boot looks awesome & is super comfortable. Seriously though, they're so loose in the ankle/top of the boot that they felt as if they were made for an ape. I can't imagine a 400 lb mammal wearing these, however."
2,Falling Over,"There are some definite postitive features about these particular sawhorses, but as a contractor often on the move some drawbacks. The amount of weight the TS-501 sawhorses can handle is surely impressive, but the folding style legs leave an uneasy feeling with any substantial weight load. The legs never seem to open well all the way. The legs have a potential to fold with any shift of the weight. An accident like this occurred with me. I had set a significant amount of deck boards on the saw horses for the weekend and when I had returned the legs had buckled to the side, the boards were scattered and the opposite legs had broken through the manufactures stop. Fortunately nothing below was damamged and the boards remained in tact, but my saw horses are useless now."
4,Tote-A-Horse Portable Adjustable Sawhorses,"Good heavy duty sawhorses, I have 4, and they are easy to fold up and store. Fairly quick and easy to adjust the height. The only negative thing is they will sink in to the ground if used outside and a lot of weight is put on them, need to support them with 1X material."
3,"Good, but needs improvement.","The main reason I purchased the Tote-a-Horse TS-501 was that the legs folded down inside the body of the unit - making a very small package for storage - important to a weekend warrior like myself. Each of the four legs is made up of two heavy gage stamped metal pieces. One leg segment is bolted to the TS-501 body and attaches to the second 'adjustable' segment via stamped holes and tabs, and secures with a carriage bolt and wing nut. The grist is: the legs wont fold into the body for storage unless you completely remove and re-attatch all 4 of the leg segments at the at the lowest (unusable) level. At that level there is no hole for the carriage bolt through both leg segments. So, you have to store the nuts and bolts (easy to loose) somewhere. I returned my TS-501s and got the Tote-a-Horse TS-101. Same as the TS-501 but the non-adjustable legs fold into the body of the unit - no fuss, no muss - and they're less expensive."
4,babylon and rastafari,"Very good source of information on the genesis of Rastafarianism and it's impact on Jamaica. However it is a little heavy on name dropping, and would have been better if it had more information on the philosophy rather than the biography. The descriptions of the early 'Rasta Camps' was great, but it left me wanting for a description of what was discussed at them. Still I would recommend this book to anyone deeply interested in the 'I'story."
2,scattered thoughts...,"I think a better and more thorough discussion of the rastafarian movement is The Rastafarians by Sr., Leonard E. Barrett. Douglas's thoughts seem to jump around in the book with long lists of individuals whose signifigance and part in the rastafarian movement needs more clarity."
5,Awesome group!,"One of the best groups you'll ever see. Their sounds are AMAZING!!! I saw them live at the Michael Buble Crazy Love Tour in Tampa 2010, and was astounded. They are truly talented. So I bought this DVD to show to my family and friends, and although it is not like seeing them live, it is a wonderful DVD. Must see!"
4,Naturally 7 tears it up at Montreux,I had never really heard of this group before I saw a video clip on them. Their performance on this DVD is simply amazing. I'm impressed and now look for music that they have worked on.
3,Not what I expected,Not what I expected and actually a little depressing but did give the feel of living in that time and under those circumstances.
4,Excellent Rinehart,I reread the end twice. She really is a past master of relationships. It will be a sad day when I read the last Rinehart.
2,"Long, slow, sad story","I like this author, but I did not like this book. I found the characters sad, the setting sad, the story line sad, and the plot extremely slow moving. The book seemed to be all about sadness and struggle, and, yes, after a certain point I skipped through to the end. Writing a ""serious historical novel"" does not mean everything in it has to be so serious. Thank goodness this was free on Kindle!"
2,Not a mystery,"I am a fan of the Golden Age mysteries and regularly read Edmund Crispin, Patricia Wentworth, Agatha Christie, Georgette Heyer, Dorothy Sayers, Gladys Mitchell and Rex Stout. I came upon this book thinking it was a mystery, but it is not. If you enjoyed ""The Case Against Elinor Norton"" you'll like this book. I found it failing in the same way- just too dated for me to read about a helpless female and how shes being destroyed by perceived or real relationships outside of marriage with men. For those who prefer a traditional cozy mystery, ""The Yellow Room"" is a better choice."
3,UUHHMM???--OKAY--JUST OKAY,I MADE IT THRU IT---I WILL SAY THAT MUCH.IT WASN'T EASY---EXCITING WILL NOT BE USED BY THIS REVIEWER.AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER REVIEWERS---I READ FASTER TOWARD THEEND---JUST TO GET IT OVER WITH!!!
5,A great collection to reminisce with friends,"I got the three disk set as used-good. It's actually in really good condition. It was remastered for DVD and keeps the same aspect as in the movie theater. The first disk, the first movie has some extras that was a nice touch. It's as raunchy as ever and that's what's makes it so funny. They really were the pioneers of their time for what it's worth."
4,A Guide for personal story preachers,"This is indeed a very valuable book for a student of story preaching. Thulin classifies personal story preaching into four different types, though that classification could be called a bit arbitrary. Out of the four types, the one called 'self portrayal' is the type that would be most effective. The reasons he gives are well thought-out and the examples are excellent. This would be a basic guidebook for those who intend to experiment with personal stories in preaching. The check list and the table at the end are particulaly helpful.If the book provided a good bibliography for the material dealt, it would have been a help for those who wanted to explore further on the subject.Xavier Thelakkatt"
2,I think its about India and China mostly,"I didn't find this book particularly helpful in terms of investing. I think most people know that India and China have become more capatilistic, in a purely relative sense, and that they will be needing to build roads, indoor plumbing, etc. Coxe seems to be a genius in his other writings and has a weekly conference available on line. This book just struck out for me."
3,Barker isn't Barker,"I haven't read this, sorry. But I wanted to stop anyone who thinks this might be Clive Barker, novelist. It isn't, trust me (I waited months for a copy of this book only to find out too late"
3,Drama training is drama training,"Now who's the clueless bonehead who orders a book called ""... drama training"" and thinks its a horror story. Jeez. Too much television."
4,Some useful distinctions,"This book is more political philosophy rather than political science. However, it makes a useful distinction between liberalization and inclusiveness. I don't necessarily think all of Dahl's conclusions hold on a universal level, but it's a useful distinction."
3,Doesn't cover SiGe HBTs,"I bought this book hoping to learn more about modeling SiGe HBTs, but then in the very first few pages the author states that the book applies to InP and GaAs (III-V), not SiGe. I guess I should have known that SiGe HBTs didn't really count as HBTs, since the title ""Introduction to modeling HBTs"" certainly doesn't include SiGe HBTs. Anyways, it's of little value to me until I get to work with InP or GaAs HBTs."
4,Fits Most Saws,"In case you're wondering if the RipMaster will work with your saw, it most likely will. It's universal design will attach to just about every aluminum top, direct drive, benchtop saw made (including the Makita 2702 and 2703). It doesn't fit the Dewalt 744, the new Bosch 4000 or the Ryobi BT3000, but Trojan makes a cart/stand model for those saws too(SC-744). Good luck."
3,Quality Control?,This stand has helped me out a lot. The only problem is that the fence cam did not work when it arrived the holes were drill in the wrong places. Infact it just barley fit over the rail. I called to get a replacement. Still waiting months later. So I ground the cam down and it works pretty good now. It is a shame thet don't care enough to send a replacement and don't check their product closer before they ship it.
2,Not what I ordered,I ordered mermaid tattoos and in the mermaid booklet were dinosaur tattoos not mermaid. Since it only costs $1.50 it's not worth returning even though my granddaughter will be very disappointed.
3,Very Pretty,"The mermaids are very pretty and fun, however they only last for maybe a couple hours and only if you put no clothing over it and make sure no water hits it. Which was very disappointing because I loved them. One tattoo I put on only lasted 20 minutes before it started fading :("
2,Slightly Disturbing,"These look like Lady Godiva with fish tails to me.For the mom, these are perfect. They go on easily & come off easily. For a child, it's a little disappointing because they want the tattoo to remain on their arm/leg/belly/face/any other weird spot they can find until they run out of spaces for more tattoos.I like the fact that a little Ivory soap and a washcloth get these off in time for pictures, work picnic, or just because I'm sick of staring at a topless mermaid on my adorable daughter's bicep."
4,Good Foundation,"This is a good foundational book on the concept of Influencials. It reads moderately quick and has a great deal of information. I recommend it to anyone who is ramping up on this topic. Caveat: the book was published in 2003. This area has changed a lot given the rise of social and online marketing. Like I said, it's a foundational book."
2,Soporific,"It's just a bunch of statistics with a few mini biographies. Here's how to read this book.. Keep reading through the mini biographies until you stumble across a paragraph that starts spitting out statistics about how X% of ""influentials"" are involved in church, spend most of their free time reading, value our free-enterprise system, etc etc, then stop right there and begin flipping through the pages until you come across a graph. That graph generally sums up what would take 5-10 pages to read. And personally, I'd rather just look at a graph than read through boring statistical data."
4,"Live, Translatable Success Stories -- & A Decent Price","With the excessive number of marketing and business books available these days, I'd nearly stopped even browsing for new ones. But, after reading through this one by Keller and Berry last weekend, I don't feel like I wasted my free time or money! A very rare occurrence! It really brings to life some of the success stories brought about by using these people dubbed ""Influentials"" and provides enough structure that I feel I can put a plan into motion."
2,Not Recommended,"If you can read the title, there's not much of a point in reading the rest of the book...except maybe for one section describing how to identify ""the influentials"". Still, I don't recommend buying it."
3,matrix smoothing system 1 shampoo,"this shampoo leaves my hair too soft and strips it of body. Would be great for dry, brittle hair because it really softens and leaves hair with a great shine. I can use it every 2 or 3 times that I shampoo."
1,There are knows allergans in Matrix Shampoos,"I'm not happy at all with this shampoo. It has sodium lauryl sulfate in it.Common ingredients that are known irritants include sodium lauryl sulfate, used to produce the lather in soaps and shampoos, is a preservative that releases formaldehyde and can cause allergic reactions, The CIR has set concentration limits on both.My neck and ears broke out after using it. I had to take steroids to get rid of the allergy which drove me nuts for a few days."
2,Too dry!,"This shampoo does not work for me, it dries my scalp and I have had minor dandruff issue since. I tried adding a few drops of caster oil but that did not help either."
2,Complete schlock,"This Turkish version of THE EXORCIST is a candidate for one of the worst films ever made. Poorly edited, with rudimentary dialogue and special effects, it is a travesty of the original Hollywood version. By comparison with this effort, Edward D. Wood jnr., PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE - generally accepted to be one of the worst films of all time - is a masterpiece. Best watched late at night after a heavy night drinking in the local bar."
3,Platinum? Hits?,"Of course, fans like all the songs, but for the casual Bananrama fan, or someone unfamiliar...this is an odd collection to encompass their career. ""Young at Heart"", ""What a Shambles"", ""State I'm In"", ""Do Not Disturb"", ""Cut Above the Rest""??? Were these even released as singles? Unless these were released and were popular in Europe and Japan, it's an odd selection of songs to put as a best of collection. No ""Venus""??!! No ""Shy Boy""? No ""Wild Life""? Why doesn't anyone include ""Wild Life"" on greatest hits compilations??!! Good collection, but 'Hits' compilation cd's are for people who like an artist, but don't want to buy all their cd's, and several of their biggest hits aren't even here. Maybe that's why it's called ""Platinum"" and not ""Greatest Hits"" or ""Best of"".I would recommend this cd accomanied by a ""Best of..."" cd."
3,an interesting experience,"Throwing Muses, with the quite talented Kristin Hersh, is one of my favorite bands, but this album didn't strike the same inner-chord University chimes with me. What can I say, maybe I'm just tired of only seeing album reviews by people who absolutely adore the album they are writing about. Limbo is very good, perhaps some of their tightest sounding music, but it doesn't have the same raw intensity of University or their earlier work. But don't let me discourage you...I own all of the Muses cds and all of Hersh's solo work. All are worth the listen."
4,Fantastic ... album,"I love this album. It was the first that I bought by the Muses, and I haven't looked back. Some of their other work is a little less poppy, so this is a great to ""break your self in""Highly recommend it. 4 stars cause it aint up there with Sgt Peppers, but a must have for a rock fan."
3,Smells great but hurts when used after an aftershave,"This stuff hurts! I mean the smell is nice with lemon and mint. I have used Proraso and other aftershave lotions and this one is by far the most painful when applied. I mean you really feel it and it wears off slowly. Skin feels soft afterwards but you have to deal with the pain first. Also, I received a tube not a bottle as shown. Don't like that but I am not returning.Too funny - I get ""0 of 2 people found the following review helpful""What didn't you like? My honesty?UPDATE:I found out that when you use this product alone it is fine - no sting at all. However, when used after you use an aftershave your face will burn."
1,Junk - Skip this item,"I opened the box and was VERY disappointed. They are made of thin metal tubing with flimsy, misaligned welds that clearly can't take much stress (appearance very suggestive of a trainee's first attempt). And then in order to use them I had to bend the crooked mounting brackets to line them up.Cheap, yes. But unless you plan on mounting them on a table top that will never be used, look elsewhere."
3,Best band out there? Really?,"These guys are talented and entertaning, yes. Live they are special, yes. It does sound a little bias, however with these reviews that possibly come from ""down south fans"" that just love their good ole' boys. I think their performances and work is average. I will continually to listen to them but have many other favorites out there."
3,"some songs OK, some plain irritating","I confess I'm not a folk music fan so I don't care for this music. A couple songs are pretty good, so 3 stars."
2,"Bah, humbug.","The Avett Brothers""Emotionalism""-----------------------------I heard a few tunes by these guys in a mellow mix on Pandora, over at a friend's barbecue, and thought, oooh nice: I'll check that out! Then I got this album and happily slapped it on the stereo, and found it profoundly irritating and contrived. I listen to a lot of country/bluegrass/twang and to a lot of indiepop, and thought this was a wholly unsatisfying mix of the two styles, although I can understand why a lot of people may be drawn to it. But, like artists such as Ben Weaver, I think these guys are trying too hard and hitting the wrong emphases, trying to make their songs stick out. The mellow tracks are okay, but the record itself is not a keeper, at least not for me. I'll pass. (Axton)"
2,Huh???,"What happened guys?My dear wife Cathy and I have been listening to these wonderful boys for years. Sometimes (a lot actually) as in-car soundtracks to road adventures we trasure. Apart from the cheeky interest and somewhat ""forward looking"" aspect of the first track, we have a trainwreck. The bulk of this CD is just a flat spin out of artistic control. Emotionalism indeed...What's next?"
1,i hate amazon,"i ordered this album MONTHS ago. i somehoe receive an email from amazon 2 weeks after the order that i am not going to get it for a while. when, i finally get the album the edges are completely destroyed. amazon flopps again."
1,Emotionalism,"Not very good at all, if you could return it cause you didn't like it, I would have, not recommended !!!!"
4,Good new grass,"Starts off with four great songs with great strumming! Good is you like Fleet foxes, Band of Horses, etc. first one I bought from these guys!"
4,The album that started it all for me,"I first heard this album a couple of months before seeing the Avett Brothers for the first time at Sasquatch in 2009. I instantly fell in love with Scott and Seth and have seen them many times and had the fortunate opportunity to meet them at Coachella in 2010.This record displays their superb writing skills and musicianship. From the up tempo Die, Die, Die (which was the first song I heard them play live) to the heart felt Weight of Lies. I especially like The Ballad of Love and Hate as it tells the story of a relationship many people have endured. Emotionalism is just that, an emotional journey I encourage you to take."
5,Emotionalism makes me emotional.,"So beautiful. Perfect, still in plastic wrap. Wonderful CD, seriously. Buy it if you wanna but I highly recommend it."
2,Emotionalism,I've heard them on the radio and seen them on tv but this disk was a let down. Some songs sound has though they like to hear themselfs for no reson other than to make noise.
5,Fantastic Album - Excellent Writers - Tremendous Live,"The Avett Brothers are some of the best songwriters out there today. They have a way of cutting topics down to the simple heart of them and revealing something very true. Their CD Emotionalism is one of my favorite CDs I have in my collection, up there with U2/the Joshua Tree and Bob Marley/Legend (I have many more interesting selections but that's for another post). I simply cannot play the album enough times. The album is somewhat mellow, and you should know that they take on a completely different persona live and play with tremendous energy live. They scream a good bit too, giving it something like a punk-bluegrass feel to it (One of the brothers Scott moonlights in a heavy metal band called ""Oh what a nightmare""). In short, the concerts are FUN and they are building a very loyal following, myself included."
5,Amazing album,"This album is definitely worth the money. I've listened to it a lot, and I continue to find new little surprises. These guys outdid themselves on this album, and it keeps getting better with every album they release."
4,The album IS Emotional,"This album does feel an evolution of the Avett's sound from previous albums - you may like that, you may not. Some of the songs are rockin' toe-tappers, others more contemplative. A couple are downright sappy (""Ballad of Love and Hate""). However, this is a band taking risks, and making GREAT music. This album feels a bit more mature than Mignonette - it aims higher, and on several songs hits that heightened mark (the first 3 songs are the best succession of 3 songs i've heard in many years on one album). But, as sometimes happens when you aim high...you occasionally miss.The ""hits"" far outweigh the ""misses"", though."
5,I'm still laughing,"This is more than just comedy. This is a guy literally spilling out his guts on stage. You won't agree with everything Hicks says, but you will definitely know where he stands. (He's 1/2 radical libertarian, 1/2 anti-capitalist populist - bizarre!) Hicks is a great comedian and a critic of American consumerism. This may be his best album. His insights are still as fresh as ever. Highly recommended for those that aren't offended by filthy language."
5,Bill Hicks rules my little world.,"I love this CD.This, along with all the rest of Bill's work that I've heared, is one of the things that have had a massive influence on my life. It's fantastic, the wry, acerbic humour is brilliant, I 've never laughed so much before or since. More than that though, Bill's observations & assertions defy belief.Buy this CD. Now."
5,Relentlessly Twisted,"So many comics have borrowed from Hicks. The man's skewed visions of the truth are nothing short of brilliant. Like the audience on this cd, sometimes you're with Hicks - and more often you're six seconds less quick on the uptake.A damned shame he's gone."
5,Run Dont walk!,If you dont own this CD you are just plain dumb! Ever hear the turm masterpiece? Well my friends this is it! So give yourself a gift. Run out and get this life changing piece of true Fn Art!
5,"Brilliant Album, though not as Relentless as ""Rant""","Bill Hicks comes on like a steamroller in every performance, flattening illusions and destroying the ""fevered egos"" in our society. However, in ""Relentless"" he still throws out little jokes to the audience to placate it, which is in direct opposition to the hell-bent-on-getting-your-attention Shiva in ""Rant"". So many individuals have stated Hicks was ""obnoxious"" or mean spirited; I view him as an idealist who has been kicked one too many times and bites back. Listening and watching him is cathartic, and of course hilarious. A voice that is too infrequently heard; and now silenced."
5,A succint summary of spitual truth.,"An excellent and definitive work. A brilliantly simple summary of the principles of self treatment. In fact, Joel insights into spiritual healing is astonishingly true and this volume is a major contribution to the spiritual lieterature of the world."
1,Product description and photo don't match!,"The product name is listed as Extended Release, but the photo shows a bottle that is NOT extended release. BEWARE! This vendor does not always write accurately. Read the reviews of their other similar product with fewer pills. There I learned that the pills are mini pills. Not mentioned in the description or title there either!You may not get what you think you will. I will not order from this vendor and then worry about the hassle of returns at my expense, etc. Shame on you, Amazon, for letting this slip by!"
2,flimsy,"We returned these without even trying them. Instead of the solid one-piece construction we needed, they are spot-welded together. For an individual's use, you'll probably get your money's worth, but we have a large facility with many riders, and I just know they wouldn't have held up under heavy use."
3,Too low.,"The saw horses are sturdy, but they are eight-ten inches too low. Even with two 2x4's screwed on top, they are still low for a 6 foot(+) tall worker."
4,Wish I'd been wearing shoes!,"I agree that these sawhorses are stable and collapse easily. I bought them because I am an apartment dweller and need extra work spaces from time to time.Recently, I was using them for an indoor painting project and was not wearing shoes. Ten stiches to my toes later I have learned my lesson. The very bottom of the bases are like razor blades! Not only will I wear shoes when using this product in the future, I have installed foam pipe insullation to the bottom of each--they are sharp enough to require a little extra protection (just in case). Be careful!!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"First, sorry for my poor english as i'm french. I used to be a great lover of Big Sandy 's music . I've seen them twice with fly right trio and boys each time it was killer performances . I loved all their albums (except the doo woop one as i don't like this style very much). For me Big Sandy and his boys were a great original western swing band who don't only cover Bob Wills tunes but try to make something new (FEELIN' KINDA LUCKY IS A KILLER in that direction ).But now where are they going ? I i don't look only for western swing music but i definitely don't like this new style (except the two instrumentals that's why i give two stars ) Where's the energy and creativity of Ashley and Lee ( I KEEP ON LOVING HIS STEELIN' STYLE). Even Big sandy seems to boring . I'm not desesperate and keep looking for their next album but at that time I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH RICH KIENZLE."
5,En Espanol: Level 1,Purchased this book as an extra copy for my son's tutor. I bought it used for under $10 (including shipping) and it was in perfect condition. I paid $70 for my son's original book from a textbook company and it wasn't in as good condition as this one. Seller shipped very quickly.
5,"Fast and easy, a great way to learn!","En Espanol is a great way to learn spanish. Its chapters are set up in an easy, logical order. There are lots of review exercises and the set-up is appealing. Not only do you learn basic vocab, there are sections on culture and history. The pages are bright and are geared toward middle/high school aged kids. At the end of every chapter there is a vocab list compiling all the new words from the chapter. It also contains a Spanish/English, English/Spanish dictionary in the back for easy reference. En Espanol makes learning spanish fun and easy."
4,En Espanol: Level 1,"GREAT BOOK WOULD Be better if you had the teachers version along with this one, but all in all with an iphone or computer translator you can figure things out and learn just fine."
1,Hard back Trash,"As I put in my other review. The ""En Espanol"" series is a total was of money. Unless you are buying this for a class that mandates you own it, stay away. Get Rosetta stone or something else this book went into the trash."
2,En Espanol 1 Uno,I decided to cancel my purchase of this book because of it took too long to ship and I needed to receive it sooner. I went with a different vendor who shipped it sooner.
2,Way too much hair,Fair product for the value but pretty unrealistic. Way too much hair and very puffy! Not one I'd purchase again.
5,Terrific Book!,"This is a wonderful children's book about our third president (US). It provides a fun story about how he loved to read and write and eat! He brought foods back from France that weren't popular here and made them famous. Jefferson got people to finally try love apples or tomatos, thought to be poisonous here in the US, but eaten often in France."
5,My students love reading about Thomas Jefferson,"I go to the Step into Reading books first when purchasing non-fiction books for my classroom library. This book might be at the top of my list for enjoyable, informational text. This is a ""good fit"" book for most of my 1st grade readers. This book is filled with very interesting facts about our 3rd president."
3,"André from Norway, keyboard player in a funk group.","Hi! My name is André from Norway. I'm a keyboard player in a semi-professional funk group here in Oslo. I usually don't like electronic pop music, it has something to do with the way the drums and bass are hard quantized. The Mourning After however, has kept the shuffle in the beat (except for the drum&bass remix of The Way You Move Me) so the music feels alive, especially the originally version of The Way You Move Me. Other great songs to enjoy are Never The Same (almost disco music with a little Erasure mixed in to it) and Waiting Till Dawn (A very nice instrumental tune with some robovocal, my personal favourite). I strongly recommend this CD and if you are into music like Depeche Mode, Erasure and other 80's bands you won't be disappointed. Regards André"
5,great garage band stuff,"Maybe be I am one of those people who likes to have a ""complete"" collection of an artist I especially admire, but this early Alejandro Escovedo effort is great straight ahead rock music even if you are not a hard-core Escovedo fan."
3,Leicester Bangs Review (1997):,"Buick MacKane - The Pawn Shop Years (Rykodisc)Anyone who knows Alejandro Escovedo's previous bands, Rank and File, and the True Believers, will be aware that he's not afraid to crank up the guitars and let rip, occasionally.Although on his solo outings he can come across a little too polite, with Buick MacKane he is back to his Tex-Mex punk roots with a vengeance. Imagine a sun-crazed MC5 raised in the desert rather than the wet and windy motor city and you'll have some idea where these honchos are coming from. If not seminal, definitely spunky."
3,Rockin Alejandro missed the target a bit,"The fact that you are even reading this review likely means that you are a fan of Alejandro Escovedo. He is, without a doubt, a song writer's song writer and is highly thought of by his peers. Prior to his solo stuff, he played in a few bands and Buick is one of them. As far as I know, this was their only release. This is a hard driving album that doesn't relent which could be one of my issues with it. Whilte the ""True Believers"" lacked quality production, the songs were generally quite good and maybe that's the key here. There's not one great song on the album just a bunch of OK rockers which is why it gets an OK review. I would say that the average fan can skip this effort and concentrate on his solo stuff."
4,A Must for Buster Fans!!,"This book is written like Keaton is speaking, and provides a glimpse as to what the ""the Great Stone Face"" may have been like in conversation. The book is great fun, but don't look for great insights to the motivations and themes behind the films...Buster is about as vague on this as his famous face is immobile. Buster leaves out details on his hardest times (alcoholism, his second wife), so it comes as no surprise that this is more a testament to his survival in show business and resurrection in the late fifties. Be ready for the realization that the greatest silent film director of all time has no ego, doesn't take himself seriously, and is a simple guy with great intuition. If you are a Buster fan, you will love this, but for specifics on personal matters, seek out Meade's ""Cut to the Chase"".Doug Straton, Degas98217@aol.com"
3,Something Missing....,"Though this book was well written, entertaining and enjoyable.... Buster never wrote about THE GENERAL! (except to say it was one of his best films) Hello!!!!!! How could he not even write one paragraph about the best-known movie he created? That would be like William Shatner forgetting to mention Star Trek...... For that reason, I cannot honestly give this book more than 3 stars, much as I enjoyed it! S"
4,Suicide Wall,"The unresolved issues of the Vietnam War have marked a generation. Many are still haunted by the decisions they were forced to make when facing death at such a very young age. How we acted and treated each other still hurts, yet we don't know how to talk about it. Five Reno-bound guys, all with different experiences of the war, revisit their choices and deal with the aftermath of those decisions. Alex Paul spins a good yarn. The plot is lively and the characters believable, as they explore the gritty side of their Vietnam experiences. I think it would make a good movie(I'd like to see Gus Van Sant direct it). I would like to see the Suicide Wall erected."
5,"""Suicide Wall""","Alex Paul does a superb job of putting a war with enormous consequences into intimate focus. I read this book a few years ago, and its impact has stuck with me. ""Suicide Wall"" should be required reading for any politician who sends American men and women into harm's way. Today, as our President considers the drawdown of forces in Afghanistan, the lessons of this book are more pressing than ever. I heartily recommend this book and applaud the author's guts -- and the cause he champions."
5,Extraordinary,"I came to Clare Francis without expectation. Women writing spy thrillers are unusual. I have to say though that her characterisations are superb! In the best traditions of Ruth Rendell and PD James, she portrays the minutiae of daily life and the inexorable progression into melodrama. The backdrop of Arctic Norway is presented in stupendous detail. The sheer endurance and uncomplaining attitude of the residents of this area astounded me. Also I have fallen head over heels for Hal...All in all this is a tremendous read - inspiring, absorbing and thoroughly believable, deftly plotted and masterfully brought to life - an extraordinary book."
5,"Haven't gotten to read this yet ""BUT""","This seems like it is going to be a very good book to read, I can't wait to get some free time and start reading it, as for the book and quality, it is in GREAT shape, almost like it wasn't even used although I bought it as a used and good condition, personally I think it should have been rated great condition, no writing on pages and not even one bent page.If you like these type of books then you should check this one out."
3,"Not Great, But The Most Complete Modern Recording","Since the particulars are rather vague here, this CD is: AnthonyAdverse - Erich Wolfgang Korngold; Varese Sarabande VSD-5285,1991; conducted by John Scott; and performed by The Berlin RadioSymphony Orchestra. Regrettably, this recording turns out to bea light-weight and somniferous (especially in the center)rendering of Korngold's film symphony. It's instrumentation isimpoverished with non-string instruments often among the missing.Rarely is the full orchestra utilized. If you are a Korngoldenthusiast, buy it. Otherwise, pass."
2,Missing the opera aria at the climax of film Anthony Adverse.,"This is a real disapointment as I was anxious to purchase the CD afterwatching the film on TV. My research has shown (via Google) that a morecomplete CD version of the import soundtrack is available on the Tsunami site, butafter browsing there and many other web sites, I could not find any that were availablefor purchase. Will this OST version be made available soon?Please e-mail me at e.coste@comcast.net with any info you may have.Thank you."
2,Expectations Not Met,I thought this DVD was about The Science of Internal Energy. It was about a Korean style of movement. The title didn't match the product in a significant way.
5,Awesome!*****,"For my nephew, he loves it and it looked better to me in person than on the website! It is very sturdy and the graphics are awesome!"
3,suspicious that the one I bought was fake,Bought this watch on Amazon.com about 1.5 years ago (naively) and I suspect that the watch I was sold is a fake so be careful when buying this product. The manufacturer hasn't been very helpful and I can't get a hold of the seller (which is my fault for not keeping the sales receipt).
1,i cant belive there isnt more bad reviws,im reading this book right now im twelve and i usualy read a book this size in three days but its been more than a week and im barley half way done i liked the first couple of chapters but then it went down hill i like fantsy and sy fi but this book is lame ive read tons of books but i cant stand this book try somethining like the hunger games or earagon those are good books i am plannimg an finishing this book just not the rest of the series
5,Epic!,The Door Within is an awesome story! It is a book that captures your attention and takes you to the land of Alleble where you follow Aiden as he fights evil enemies and learns to respect his family more. I loved this book and I couldn't put it down! Making a movie out of The Door Within would be epic.
4,Not the Best,Not the best but still good! If you like other worlds with dwarfs and other strange creatures try it out. Maybe you'll like it better than I did.
4,Adventures are funny things...,"""Adventures are funny things, and they always begin with the unexpected. But the best adventures of all are the ones that never end.""So Aidan Thomas learns when he is swept into the adventure of a lifetime.When his parents decide to move from Maryland to Colorado to take care of Grampin, his grandfather, Aidan is devastated. But a series of strange events leads him to a whole new world - The Realm, land of dragons, knights, and raw adventure. Called by the King, Aidan is immediately whisked into adventure after adventure as the knights faithful to the one true king attempt to defeat the evil Paragor. Between rigorous training, lethal treachery, moonrascal tunnels, and thrilling battles, unlikely hero Aidan learns of King Eliam and sacrificial love.Wayne Thomas Batson's debut novel is an exciting fantasy story full of truth, laughter, and adventure."
4,Great Book,This is a great book. Once you read the first chapter you sorta become hooked and then you find your self reading the book in 3 days time. Very easy read. I loved it. Get it. You'll enjoy it.
2,A disappointment,"OK first the disclaimer. I'm an adult who reads a lot, both for myself and to my children, so initially I thought that my age skewed my opionion here, but when my kids agreed I felt justified in giving this book a low rating.Anyway I was shocked to dislike the book as much as I did. 51 reviews and it still held a five star rating on Amazon. How could the book possibly be bad? The writing was overly simplistic (even for a childs book), the charaters where dull and far to emotional, and the Christian allegory was way overblown. Don't get me wrong here, I have nothing against Christianity, I'm one myself, but it's placement in this book took away from any orginality that the author potentially had and made the book come across as an obnoxious Sunday school lesson taught by a teacher whom nobody can really stand."
4,Enjoy...,"I'm not a Jackson 5 fan,, but did enjoy most of this CD. I prefer to just listen to Michael, but it is nice to occasionally hear him at that young age, such a super talent!"
1,Definitely not a quality product.. a contractors opinion!,"I'm not sure how long the other reviewer had his before he wrote it or what kind of work he did but I've had this for 3 months and it's falling apart already. The pivot bolts that hold the wheel side have literally sheared off. The platic wing nuts that are all over this thing are breaking. I can't say which stand would be better because I haven't tried another yet but I can say for sure that unless you are a once in a while user, you had better not waste your money on this one."
3,"Basil, my brother, you were missed!","After reading Valerie Wilson Wesley's ""When Death Comes Stealing,"" I eagerly awaited her next book. I read ""Devil's Gonna Get Him"" and all I could say was, ""Where's Basil DuPree?"" I waded through this book hoping Basil would come. He didn't disappoint me...but the rest of the novel did. The action is slow and Tamara, a seasoned detective stumbled on the solution almost by accident. Where is the spark from the first novel?"
2,This book is very slow.,"This book is slow and it is not getting to the point fast enough. She is using a lot of words to say nothing. Just like Terry McMillian's How Stella Got Her Groove Back, this book is allowing us to get into Tamara's inner thoughts. Some of her thoughts need not be heard. They are somewhat useless to me. I checked this book out from the library a little over 3 weeks ago and I'm only half way through it. It's just plain boring to me. It is going to take me another 3 weeks to finish it. I was reading other reviews about her other books. I am going to try and give this sister the benefit of the doubt and try to read her other books. If you really want to read good mystery written by an African American women then you should read books written by Eleanor Taylor-Bland, now she's an excellent mystery writer. I am going to finish this book only because a sister wrote it. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,A good read!,"This is the second Tamara Hayle mystery that Ive read and I can't wait for the third. However, I must admit that this one was a bit more difficult to follow than her first novel. I agree with the other reader who said that Tamara seemed to stumble upon the answer to this mystery, rather than relying on her detective skills to solve it. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the book and cannot wait to see what becomes of Tamara's relationship with Basil!"
4,"No ""Sleep"" on this novel!","WHERE EVIL SLEEPS wasn't as fast-paced as the last two Tamara Hayle mysteries, but it still had a good storyline that was filled with interesting characters and enough action and mystery to keep me reading. It had it's moments of filler space, still, keep reading. A good third novel in this series. Mrs. Wilson-Weseley, keep the ball rolling!"
3,Detective Tamara Hale's romp in Jamaica is no vaction,"After reading the first two novels starringour favorite Detective Tamara Hale, I waslooking forward to reading this novel.The novel started out good with Hale asthe innocent tourist down in Jamaica on vacationdrawn into a murder mystery(very Hitchcock) in anightclub by a film noir type woman. The rest ofthe novel has the character running around tryingto solve the murder , trying to get her lostpassport and money back, and running from thereal killer.The characters she encounters leave me cold. Theyare stereotypes that have been rehashed countlesstimes in detective novels. The only highlight inthe novel is the sexual tension between Hale andDupree comes to a head."
2,Weak High End,"Maybe it's just me since the other reviewers rate it so highly. I find the high end weak. The horns and cymbals just don't shimmer with life like I've heard on other recordings. I should note that I'm listening to this disc on a conventional cd player. In it's HDCD version, it may sound differently."
5,A whole lotta owls,"This book is lovely as are all the Maurice Pledger books. Henry loves books that he can interact with, and I love them because they are full of UK animals which is where I am from. Our grandchildren really love this one too."
1,ZERO STARS,I imagine this is a ggod book if English is your second or third language and your not trying to speak it that much.
4,"A Good, Solid Dollhouse, if a little pricey","Santa gave this to my then-7-year-old daughter in 2007. It replaced a much smaller dollhouse, also by Plan. It's a great design: pretty easy to assemble and inviting to play with. My daughter and her friends have played with it fairly regularly over the past year. However, her favorite thing to do with it is rearrange the furniture.Be warned -- the house comes with no furniture. Expect to pay an additional [...] for each ""room"" of furniture, if you want to stick with the furniture made by Plan Toys. This basically doubles the cost of the house!"
5,We all LOVE this dolhouse!,"We ordered this dollhouse for my 2 year old for Christmas. It went together pretty quickly, though an eectric drill helps. It's beautiful! It's exactly what we wanted and it's a perfect size! My daughter LOVES it and plays with it multipe times a day. We have the furniture that goes with it and the dolls...all of which are great. The furniture is amazingly detailed, durable and have lots of little extras! The house is just wonderful! We couldn't be happier! I do think we will eventually buy a cube of some sort to sit it on, so that the bottom level is more accessible. I am really glad we saved a little money by purchasing this version of the house, as the newer one is more pricey but no better than this beautiful original! I def. recommend this!"
4,What's in a Chinese Character,A very intuitive book with a historical approach to chinese characters.It helps one learn some of the basic characters and even read some characters from ancient chinese scripts.
2,Terrible writer,"I am shocked to find that so many people gushed over this book. The narrative was boring, cloying and drippy. There were some interesting new things as far as hauntings go, like the cat's strange behavior and the water incident. I really have no sympathy for a family that is too stupid to look into the history of the house sooner. I mean, it was ten years of torture before they even decided to get any kind of help at all. The main problem with the writing was how repetitive it was. I did not need to hear the details of the same ""suffocating dream"" all 75 times it happened. And the dialogue was far too detailed to be real recollections. No good and not scary."
2,So-so,"So-so were the only words I could come up with for this book. While the content of the actual haunting was intriguing, the book was both written and edited poorly. I can't count how many times she repeated she felt ashamed about the haunting. While that may have been true, it didn't need repeated in just about every chapter. The main thing that bothered me though, was that fact that she wrote about being so scared, terrified even. However, upon getting help, 10 years into her situation, she was reluctant to have her privacy invaded and was non-believing in what she was being told by the investigators. Plus, her family was upset that the house was cleansed. That was just weird to me, after years of disturbances, you wouldn't want the spirits to pass on? Ones that have been in agony for almost 200 hundred years of being earth-bound? Seemed kind of wishy-washy to me. I've read a lot better by new writers.Grave's End"
2,Wanted to like it but......,"I went in wanting to like this ""true story"". Left thinking that either: 1) It was pure fiction or, 2) If it were a true story, no one can be that ignorantly defiant. After all of these episodes - years and years worth - you don't move because of potential financial implications. And this is with children involved?Same stories over and over. Found it to be repetitive and not believable - it terms of the events and the people's reactions to the events.If you're going to make up a story and sell it as truth - make it somewhat believable."
2,Too long and repetitive,"This was quite a slog, considering the fact that the events relayed in the book don't seem to build towards any meaningful resolution. It's not particularly scary, and the author seems to spend as much time talking about her bad marriage (basically saying the same thing over and over) and her worries about her daughter sleeping downstairs. Badly in need of an editor, because the author has no sense of pacing whatsoever. Read fifty pages and you've read the whole thing, because the same stuff gets rehashed over and over. Smothering dreams, bouncing lights, stuff whizzing around, an unsympathetic husband, etc."
3,"Interesting, But Disappointed. .","Just finished reading this book. It was very interesting and creepy read, BUT why in the heck would you stay in that environment for 10+ years? There needed to be more information on what the psychics found, instead of a wham, bam, thank you ma'am house cleaning. AND. . isn't there a law that if you find human remains they must be excavated?I believe that what they experience was true, but the book was poorly written and left out some key information regarding pertinant episodes."
5,"Scary, and leaving you wanting more!",I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. Gives you a whole new meaning to living with ghosts. I learned alot from this book. Nothing like reading a book from a real experience and a heartfelt meaning behind it! I had goosebumps all the way to the end.
3,swallowing....,"No, I don't have difficulty swallowing the reality of the experiences this book is about. Not at all. I'm sure it's a very truthful account of what happenened in the spooked house over the years. My difficulty lies with the 'healthy American spirit' of this very much alife woman writing her story, and her obvious and annoying inability to read the right books, talk to the right persons, find the right information to set some steps towards some kind of openminded understanding of what is, maybe, perhaps, who knows, going on. Reading this book I felt increasingly irritated, asking myself what it is that makes people trying to cope with something out of the ordinary for many years, and rather risk their sanity, their health, their children and their happiness than aknowledge the possible existence of something outside their petty prefabricated conceptions?This book is about the value of an open inquisitive mind, written by somebody who definitely doesn't own one."
5,Couldn't put it down !,"If I had read the reviews, I probably wouldn't have purchased this book but I am glad I did. This is a great story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I couldn't put the book down and stayed up all night so I could finish it ! It's a fast read and the story is fascinating, the kind that you remember for years to come ! I especially liked reading about the cat's bizarre behavior when the ""spirits"" manifested themselves. I'll never look at my cat the same way again !"
4,Quick easy read,"I thought this book was really enjoyable. One of the things I appreciated was Elaine didn't leave holes in the story, you're not left wondering why. If you like true accounts of ghost stories than you will most likely enjoy this book."
5,Better Than Most,"I love true ghost stories, but I find I'm usually disappointed with the books I've read claiming to relate true accounts of paranormal experiences--they just aren't that scary and are often rather boring. This book was definately not boring...I couldn't put it down and I actually did find myself getting creeped out frequently. I think the problem with most ""true ghost story"" books is that you don't often get first-hand accounts and you don't get a lot of details regarding witnesses' personal experiences. Here, you get a first-hand account with plenty of detail. Even the stuff that doesn't directly relate to the haunting--namely the author's account of her dysfunctional relationship with her grouchy husband--is interesting. Definately a good read...you won't feel like you've wasted your money."
3,Suffocating Dreams,"This is a tale of a ""true ghost story"" allegedly, taking place in Brooklyn in 1982. It was a fast and entertaining book, nothing better than a good ghost story to read late night when all alone. It was written by Elaine Mercado who at times comes across as a weak and helpless woman who has no control over her life. I only wanted to slap her a few times. It just seemed like she was forever beating herself up throughout the novel. This distracted from the main story of the thirteen-year nightmare only because I thought it was such a shame that she didn't help her daughters out of this terrifying situation sooner. I did enjoy it immensely, but then again give me a story of a haunting and I am hooked."
3,Not That Frightening,"This could have been a terrifying story, but Elaine Mercado did not know how to make you feel the dread that she obviously must have felt in that house !! She didnt stay on the stories of the paranormal experiences long enough, and she talked more about her family problems than anything !!! Besides this it is a great book !!!"
2,Literature's End!,"If you are looking to be scared -- this book does provide some creepy moments, but the repetitive, seemingly endless mantra of ""let's ignore the obvious in every way"" theme only serves to annoy the reader into not wanting to know or care what happens in the end. Granted, the author states in the beginning that she is a nurse, not a writer, but where was her editor? The truth of Ms. Mercado's ongoing haunting is frightening, but the book itself should be buried."
1,If you heard the interview on Coast to Coast AM . . .,"don't bother reading this book. If you absolutely must buy this book, read the first 30 pages and the last 20. Everything in between is Elaine telling how scared she is every other sentence. This was an easy read and she expresses herself well, but this story didn't need to be made into a book."
2,Boring,Throughout the entire book the author refers to her husband as her husband. She never mentions him by name. I found it rather annoying. Either he didn't want his name mentioned when she wrote this book or she has an axe to grind with him over their breakup. The explanation of paranormal experiences are repetitive to the point where I skipped through various chapters and paragraphs in order to get to the meat of the story. I finaly got to the chapter where the mediums come in and clean the house. End of story. Overall the book was boring.
5,book,Ordered this for a gift that was requested by my daughter. She enjoyed the book. Book was received in timely fashion.
3,Meh,"Not a great read, but it was entertaining. The ending came a little quickly, and the lead up didn't amount to much, but it was a good train read."
3,Pretty good,"It had it's ups and downs, but overall it was a good read. The only issue was that it got slow hear and there. Definitely a scary experience for anyone though!"
5,had to read it twice!,"I originally heard about this book from the author on a paranormal radio program... the moment i saw it at my local book store i bought it. It's an excellent read and i couldn't put it down. Being into this type of activity, i've read the book twice and given it to all my friends who were brave enough to read it. Definately scary and interesting. A must read for fans of ghost stories!"
2,Disappointing!,"I am very interested in the paranormal based on numerous experiances that I have had in my life, i have been searching for a book that would really scare me... THIS IS NOT IT. the experiances were weak and the writing was more about her bad marriage than dealing with the paranormal. I say SKIP IT!"
2,Sleep Paralysis?,"I'm confused as to why the author puts so much emphasis on the sleep paralysis episodes. It's a perfectly normal condition, and she claims to be aware of this fact, but she still goes on to attribute it to paranormal acitivty. She implies that the episodes got worse due to the haunting, including a smothering sensation, a sense of an evil presence, and a sense of overwhelming terror, but these are still CLASSIC symptoms of sleep parlaysis. From Scientific American: ""The reason sleep paralysis may explain tales of ghosts and aliens is the strong sense of a presence, usually harmful, that victims commonly feel during an attack.""Also, people tend to experience sleep paralysis episodes more frequently due to stress, so all it demonstrates is that the author was stressed out during this time, not that it was actually caused by ghosts (as she would like her readers to believe)."
1,Author loves to be the victim/martyr,"This was a terribly repetitive book, as others have stated.Oh, I was so, so, so, so, so scared, but I guess I will wait for someone to rescue me.Oh, my relationship with my husband was so, so, so, so, so bad.Oh, I like my job so, so, so, so, so much.Basically, she sits around waiting over a decade for someone else (finally, her brother stepped up) to find some sort of resolution. Meanwhile, she takes the bedroom where no one has been held down and suffocated in their sleep, while her daughter continues to ""deal"" with it. I began to dislike the author as a person, not only as an author.Giving this book a so-so rating would be so, so generous."
2,Redundant,"I feel as though this almost 200 page book could have easily been half the size if the author didn't repeat herself a million times. We get that your marriage was bad, that you were cold in your old apartment, etc. Instead of the ""filler"" material just tell the story.Admittedly, I have only finished about 25% of the story. I keep reading it hoping something will happen but so far it just keeps repeating itself. I don't know if I will finish this one.At least it was a free book so I didn't lose out on anything."
4,Grave's End: A True Ghost Story,This was a very well written and informative book about an actual experience with ghosts. I thoroughly enjoyed how the book was organized and presented. My only question would be why didn't the author seek qualified assistance to deal with her ghosts sooner? I don't think I could have lived in this situation that long without seeking help. Especially since the entire family was affected. This is a book worth reading.
3,ok not great,Although possibly true this book did not hold my attention. I wish the family peace. The author just needed to express her feelings.
2,Eh....its okay,"There are definitively some creepy things going on in the house, but the story is not written very suspensefully. A good quick read."
3,Decent read,This was a decent read. I thought the author did a pretty good job of describing her feelings and her thoughts about what was going on around her.
5,Read the book in 3 days,"I went to a local Borders to browse, and just by chance, I ended up reading a few chapters of this book. After leaving, I decided that I had to go back and buy it, and I ended up reading it in three days. Very good read, and very spooky. The ending definitely gives you closure."
5,Grave`s End,"This was a fun read. It was well written,and has some real spooky moments in it. A lot of these type stories are very hard to believe, but this one wasn't. I also saw this story some months ago on the syfy channels Paranormal Witness. The book is much better then the shows version."
3,don't read it at night :),"It's a very interesting book and I read it quickly, but while reading it I was asking myself all the time why she didn't get help sooner. I just don't get it how can you live for decades (!) in a house like this (tortured by the spirits) and don't get the house cleaned."
4,interesting true ghost account,"Written by a nurse so theres an objective view. It was interesting. Wasnt something that kept me totally engrossed, but I did want to know what happened. The resolution isnt what I expected. I downloaded for free, so def worth it."
4,Ok,Pretty good for a freebie. I don't know if I would read it again or share. Interesting just slow at times.
5,A MUST READ,"I have read this book four times thru the years I love it so much. It is the perfect haunted house book and very believeable. Some people wonder how she could keep living in a house like that, but I understand her because I also lived in two haunted houses myself and you can become sucked into them and sometimes even miss the excitement when you do leave! I love elaine's style of writing and just wish I could find another book as good as this one again. Thanks Elaine for your story."
4,Compelling True Haunting,"I couldn't put this book down. While it is written in a somewhat amateur voice, the author's story was carefully and thoughtfully recounted through the pages. Written with intelligence, honesty and surprising sensitivity [on the spirits' behalf] it was an admirable true tale to tell."
4,I read it in one sitting,"Grave's End is much better than your average ""true"" haunted house story. The supernatural experiences of Elaine Mercado, her family and friends are both frightening and fascinating. If you enjoy a well written ghost story, this one will keep you reading well into the wee hours."
3,honest and spooky,"In this book, author Elaine Mercado relates her personal account of living in a haunted house. Although the dialog generally feels forced and the order in which she relays events occasionally feels discordinant, over all, the book was very enjoyable.I appreciated the author's skepticism, which I felt lent the book a sense of honesty and believability, and there was enough scary stuff to give me a chill- exactly what I am after when I pick up a ghost story."
3,Worth reading for the avid ghost hunter,"If you are anything like me, you've read every book on ghosts that you can find, and you're beginning to run out of new ones to sink your teeth into. I read Grave's End thinking it looked interesting. It was to a certain extent, but not terribly well-written or professional. Mercado strays from the explanation and definition of many paranormal events to use the book as a forum to discuss her personal life, her weaknesses, and to state her grievences against her ex-husband, about whom she has something passive-aggressively nasty to say on every other page. This book was too frequently a memoir instead of a book about the paramormal. The writing style itself was painful in spots, almost childish in its inexperience. I toyed with giving this book two stars, but I gave it three, because it was pretty entertaining at times, and worth reading."
3,its ok,It was interesting but not enough to never put to it down.It was a good read to pass the time but that's about it.I like a ghost story that makes me alittle afraid of the dark after and thisbook doesnt cut it.
2,"A Good Ghost Story Should Make Your Heart Skip a Beat, Not Put You to Sleep",OK I have to say this is the dullest and most confusing ghost story I have ever read. Not only does it create no sense of fear in the reader but the author doesn't convey a sense that she is truly afraid. There is no sense of menace and more a sense that this is a change in her boring life. The writing is flat out terrible. There is no real story being told here other than the author's life living in what she believes is a haunted house. I can't help but notice the more involved she becomes in paranormal research the more she believes her house is haunted. Cause and effect I believe.Don't waste your time here it is a dull book with no real story.
3,"Frankly, a bit suspicious","I enjoyed the book. But now, after thinking about it, I am frankly a bit suspicious. Not to rain on anyone's parade. There's just something about certain the details I cannot verify. Like the ""smell of bananas"" equaling spectral/paranormal activity. I've asked a paranormal investigator about this and he said he had never heard of a specific smell (like banana) equaling the same phenomenon every time. And he hasn't heard of people smelling banana at any rate, in terms of spectral/paranormal phenomenon. Also, were tunnels or mines being dug in Brooklyn? I can't seem to verify that, either."
3,Very Interesting.....,"I have to say this story is believeable. I did find myself scanning through the paragraphs skipping the boring parts, only reading the parts that contained ghost encounters. ..."
2,faulty handle pins,"Assembly was easy but the spring-loaded anchoring pins that pop into the holes in the sleeves of the handle support were faulty. This is a dangerous flaw as the security of the handle in maneuvering the saw is essential. I have to attempt to file the inside ""chads""(!) of the holes to allow the pins to more fully penetrate the hole and be secure. Otherwise seems fine."
3,It works,"This is an ACTUAL Toshiba name brand product, so the computer recognizes it. However, the battery will only attain a maximum charge of 60%, and I would bet the seller knew this when they sold it."
4,"Good, VERY good...","I am a current EMT-B student and currently use this book as text. The book is indeed easy to read, and has a lot of features to help a student prepare for that dreadful exam. I reccomend buying the workbook as well, to really solidify the knowledge gained by reading. In my class the tests are easy in comparison to the questions in the workbook, this is why I recommend buying the workbook. Also, using all of the features incorporated in this book will, with out any doubt, prepare you for the test. The assessment chapters are mangled as the instructor's review says, but there is a great graphic in the front of the book and being how assessment is SO VITAL, one should visualize it on their own and practice till its like tieing a shoe. All in all a quality well thought out book, with tons of features."
4,Excellent Workbook,"I used this workbook in conjuction with the Emergency Care Book, to prepare for the state registry EMT-B test, and the NREMT-B test. This is a MUST have if you are using the Emergency Care Book. Questions are nearly identical in wording and phrasing to the NREMT-B exam, and the inclusion of practice homework problems add even more preparation oppertunities. DO NOT BUY THE EMERGENCY CARE BOOK, WITHOUT THIS WORKBOOK!"
4,Indestructable,"My 19 month old Great Grandson was lavished with fancy gifts at Christmas Time, some played with some not, yet this little drum was truly a hit! He could distinguish the different tones that were made due to the curved cut on the top. I'm certain that it will last for his own progeny."
2,I'd prefer better sounds,"My son loves anything to do with drums, but he really isn't into this toy. I think he'd like it better if it came with two drumsticks instead of only one. Also, I find it interesting that the drum is cut to make three different tones, but the choice of tones is off-putting."
1,"Would be fantastic, if modified","When you look at the design, you will see the center is more ""cut out"" than the rest. While this is necessary to allow for different sounds, this center piece of wood needs to be thicker. My 2 yr old Grandson broke that piece after playing with it for about an hour or so. {It was broken by being hit with the drumstick} The toy had to be thrown out. there was no repairing it as the break was sharp and dangerous.While it does help the child create many different sound & again, all that is needed is to make that one piece of wood thicker. It is a good toy for musical education otherwise. But the ""Otherwise"" is a biggie! I'll be writing to the manufacturer about this as well."
5,pelicula increible,"es una gran pelicula que narra la historia de nuestro heroe enfrentandose a uno de sus mas poderosos enemigos... la verdad vale la pena adquirir esta cinta, seguro que no se arrepentiran!, es una muy buena pelicula, con efectos especiales buenos tambien. No es la mejor del mundo, pero para un buen coleccionista no puede faltar!"
3,Character figure,"I had ordered this item and a wrong item was sent. The Wall of Fame people were so great. They are truly a customer service oriented company. Before buying this toy, be sure to read the description. It says that the arms and legs are removable. They truly are - making it much fun for my 4 year old grandson, and frustrating for my 2 year old grandson."
4,Turning point is MOST DEF on point,"Mario's last album was nice and catchy but very young at best. On Turning Point Mario takes the more grown up approach with not only his songs but his image. When ""Let me love you"" hit I couldn't believe how much range he had in his voice. When the album came I quickly got it. It's very unfortunate that Usher had the year he had because Mario is gonna be put in the ""Trying to be like usher"" list. This album has many high points such as ""Let me love you"" ""Couldn't say no"" ""Call The Cops"" ""Nikes fresh out the box"" and the rock filled ""Here we go again"". Mario is only 18 as he states and if he keeps improving his music like he did with this album there really won't be any more ""like usher"" talk."
3,"Average, jus plain average","Next time, you buy my cd remember I just make average cd'sWhat can I say? This album was dissapointing or what?! Earlier this year everyone was dong their thing to let me love you(you know what i'am saying!). So off the back of that single I decided to buy this. Though there are some good tracks (let me love you,boom and shakedown) average (Girl I need,Directions) and just downright corny(fresh out the box, like me real hard).Overall his sound has developed as he has aged but he just sounds like another average rnb singer. Buy omarion instead!"
5,A Good CD!,"I would reccommend this CD to anyone who has enjoyed Mario's singles off the radio (Let Me Love You, and How Could You)....throughout the rest of the CD Mario continues to deliver the way he did on those tunes.Just to let you know, L.Holmes: this Mario and Mario Winans are not the same person!"
2,Please Mario!,"I must admit, Mario's voice has intensly matured. I see now that he really can sing, BUT why won't he showcase that??!!! Songs like ""How Could U"" & ""Nikes Fresh Out The Box"" keep you listening but by the end of the Cd you're left highly dissapointed. The lyrics in songs like ""Like Me Real Hard"" are ridiculous! If some dude said that to me I'd probably smack him. What is ""I'm not sayin that you should rush and give me your heart. I'm just asking that you like me real hard..just like me real hard"" Take a writing class Mario, pleazzz! In the entrance of the song I catch myself saying this seems like a nice song but when he starts sayin like me real hard I just say ""SKIP"" Directions is the same way. The lyrics are mediocre & Stupid! I hope in his 3rd Album he finds himself and comes w/ more songs like how could u!"
5,Definitely his Turning Point,This album is great from beginning to end. Mario has a great voice and this album has a more mature sound. His impressive first single caught my attention and the remix to it (which is included on the album) I can't stop dancing to! All I have to say is...Go Mario!!!
1,I would have expected more,"Frankly, I generally don't buy much music anymore for various reasons. However, when I saw Mario's album in the store, I gave it a quick listening-through and simply purchased it spur of the moment because I really liked ""Let me love you"" and because the other songs didn't seem to sound abysmally bad. Unfortunately, after listening to the album for several times, I had to discover that other than ""let me love you,"" there really weren't any other songs on the album that I liked. I find myself skipping song after song until I end up at track 2 yet again. Of course, music taste is truly subjective but I still would think that there should be at least one other song on an album that is worth listening to. This album falls very short of that."
3,What a Turning Point,"Gee,What can i say? I really like Mario and I loved his FIRST cd but I can't say the same for this one. Maybe it was the production. Maybe I need to listen to it againI Liked a total of 2 songs from that cd and thats not enough for me.I will give Mario credit, I was able to see him sing live and to be a newbee, he did a very good job. I was able to keep me very entertained with is voice and almost good moves.I think he is trying to transition his self for a boy to a man, so i will give him the benefit of the doubt for that."
4,Great Breakthrough,"This is a new album from a fresh new talent so you can't expect too much out of it. Nevertheless, it is still a great album with one of the biggest songs of 2004 ""Let Me Love You"" and the new single ""How Could You"" and with hits like these, he is on his way to superstardom. He has become one of the hottest stars of 2005 with appearances at the Grammy Awards, BET Spring Bling and countless interviews and he has appeared in many different magazines including People. This album contains some Usher influenced R&B as well as some reggae and his vocals are amazing which makes this CD worth buying. If you like Usher, R. Kelly or even B2K, then most probably you'll like this album so don't wait any longer and buy it."
3,Its oK,"I dont know if its just me...but does anyone else feel like Mario sounds a little like Usher. I mean his runs...the soft spoken confessions (ie. ""Couldnt Say No), even the excessive use of his falsetto. I will admit that this album is much better than the debut but its not original at all. I think he's a talented singer but he needs to come into his own or else he'll always be considered an USHER copier. I know he says that he isnt trying to be like other people but it clearly seems that way. Even the song ""Boom"" is reminiscent of Usher's ""YEAH."" We all know that there is nothing new in music nowadays but I find it kind of odd that his album is so close to sounding like Usher's. Nice Try."
5,Kudos Mario!,"No I didn't buy the first album....but there were a few jams on there but I'm not really into buying new artist albums.....but when he put out ""let me love you"" he really grabbed my ear! Don't get me wrong there are a few songs on the album that are kinda blah but what artist doesn't have fillers.....but as a whole it is excellent! (More jams than fillers!) I heard him say that How Could You is gonna be the next single...that's cool but the best song on the album is Nikes Fresh Out the Box. Being a 22 year old woman I was shocked that a song named NFOTB would be a jam to me. Mario is truly a rising artist that folks should watch in the next few years. His vocals are very strong....yes better than Usher's cause sorry yall that boy can't sing! And as far as the Marving Gaye inspiration that he talks about.......PLEASE! Don't use the late great's name like that! GO BUY THE MARIO ALBUM. It's a great piece of feel good music, and the boy has talent!"
3,Mario's Turning Point,"Mario's second album is better then the first that gave us his version of Biz Markie's ""Just a Girl"" but not much more chart hits then that. Mario has matured and become a young man. ""Let Me Love You"" was one of the best R&B ballads so far this year and topped the Billboard and is obviously the highlight if this album. This album both got some great ballads and uptempo songs. ""How Could You"" is a good ballad aswell and ""Girl I Need"" is a uptempo song with reggae feautures and ""Here I go again"" uptempo and ""Nikes Fresh Out the Box"" sounds like R. Kelly old school, both great additions. There are quite few good male R&B artists these days, and even if Mario both sound and dance simular to Usher he probably got a bright future ahead of him and should not be mistaken for Usher at all. ""Turning Point"" is a good album, both catchy and mature for a 18 year old, that grows on you the more you hear from it. Don't be mislead by the 3 stars, this album is good if you like R&B."
4,"""aight"" album","I thought the album was ""aight"" because it could have been better but I gave it four stars because Mario's cool layed back voice made me like it even if the beat wasn't that tight.Here's the top two I liked1.Let me love you- It was so smooth and he song the mess out of that song.2.Boom- That beat was raw man!So the album was aight but I definately recommend it."
2,"average&Basically Usher lite,but better vocals","Mario has made a change Image wise&also is pushing a few more slow cuts,but on a whole a formula at duplicating what Usher has done seems to be on the drawing boards throughout this set. Mario vocally has improved,but alot of these tracks seem like another batch of Usher lite leftovers. time will tell if Mario finds His own Idenity as a Artist."
2,Turing Point,"I brought this cd , because I liked the first single ""Let me love you"", I was expecting the rest of the cd to be just as hot, but i was wrong. The only other two good songs on this cd where ""Directions"", and the remix to ""Let me love you"". Mario did put some effort into his other songs but they were disappointing.I hope the he does better on his next cd. This also taught me a lesson to always listen to a cd before I buy it."
1,he does not copy usher,"he and usher and omarion and all these losers think they're michael jackson, but they're just computerized dancers who got nothing on the king of pop"
3,How Could He?,"After listening to every song off this cd, the only ones I liked were ""Let Me Love U"", and ""How Could U"". I think they went overboard and tried to cover too many styles of music. Let's face it, he's not Michael Jackson or Stevie Wonder. Some of the songs on the cd were a bit ghetto, and it just didn't work with Mario's voice. The song ""Nike's fresh Out the Box"" is a ballad? Huh? A very uneven album, but still worth listening to."
2,?,"i dont know what to say about this album. i like about 3-4 songs, but his voice sounds so weird, kind of like he's singing through his noes. but still, this is a pretty decent album."
3,This should be Mario's 1st album and the Debut should be 2nd,"This album is not what i thought it would be. The beats are tight and so are the lyrics, but the way the production is makes the songs HORRIBLE! im not calling this a horrible album, because Mario does have a good voice, im just saying he could have done better on his secong LP!.........Stand-out songs are: let me love you, directions, how could you, and Nikes Fresh out the box.....I reccomend this album to Mario FANS! and not the ones who buy it just because they like ""Let me love you"".....It WILL be a waste of money when u can just download ""let me love you"" or buy the Cd single by itself"
2,AN AVID MARIO FAN IS DISSAPOINTED!,"I expected so much from this LP and I am sad to say that I was extrememly dissapointed. I am a huge Mario fan but I really think he took a step backwards on this album. I liked the first album 100 times better. He barely uses his beautiful voice on this one. He doesn't try to show his range or hit any notes. I think he tried too hard to be hip hop or something cuz there is like 2 ballads. I don't know what it is. Theres only one good song, ""let me love you"" and the remix ----such a shame cuz he is so talented."
1,Rotten Blues For An Afternoon,"I tried to find something good about this CD. However, it just might be the worst compilation of half-hearted efforts I've ever listened to. I started to give it away, but was afraid it might fall into the hands of someone who was listening to what they thought were blues for the first time; I couldn't stand the thought of them making an assessment based on this (...) effort. Definitely money misspent. Save yours. Actually a ""no-star"" rating."
4,Not so Rotten After All,A wonderfully diverse selection of slow blues tunes. Great performances and top notch production make this a must have sample package.
5,Understanding the emptiness,"before this book published there were some misunderstanding of Buddhism as nihilism for example. but after publishing of this book it changed. this book is somewhat old but classical text on the philosophical system of Buddhism from the viewpoint of Kantian logic to be readable to westerners.this viewpoint caused some debates these days. but for this viewpoint it's still the best introdution to Buddhism. This book covers the development from primitive Buddhism to Mahayana, especially to Middle way school. the discussion is concentrated on this school. the merit of this book is that the arguments between Buddhsim and Hindi and among Buddhist schools are well described."
4,Great reference for teachers,I like that this book includes referrals for books for different areas of study. It's an essential book to keep after you finish your children's literature course.
2,Had to have it for my class,"This is not a book that I would buy to read just because I wanted to. I had to buy it for my Children's Literature class. I don't know why my teacher had us buy it, because she barely uses it and it's not a helpful book at all."
3,just okay,"This book was rather redundant and boring. I did get a few things from it, but it certaintley wasn't worth the money."
3,3 bucks,"I got this dvd sealed and new at a store for three bucks. Its basically the Smackdowns where the WWE entertains the troops for Christmas. Some good action and alot of bonus features about the tour. If you can get it at the price I paid, then its worth it. Over ten dollars and its not."
1,Confusing,"It is very unclear what this product is, who wrote it or who published it.Is this a book by Houdini or an expose of Blain and CopperfieldI need more information before I could consider buying it."
2,quick set up. but that is it,"Yes it sets up in seconds..but the stabilty is the pits. if you own a dewalt 12 inch saw or any other saw that is other than small, stay away from this product. you will have to make some supports for the saw and also the legs bite into the wood so-so. the teeth on the legs bend as much as they bite. quality of this product is poor."
5,Ring Of Honor: Best In The World review.,Better then any WWE DVD I ever saw. The wrestling in the disc is first-rate even the Samoa Joe-Kikutaro match had better wrestling then the crud they put in WWE. The best matches in the DVD were the Bryan Danielson-Lance Storm-World title match & the Samoa Joe-Kenta Kobashi match which both were the showstealer of this disc. No bad matches on this disc. The rest were also first-rate. I give this DVD a 10 out of 10.
5,Awesome.,"This DVD is a must for anyone who appreciates real pro wrestling, not ""sports entertainment"". The Samoa Joe vs. Kenta Kobashi match alone is worth whatever you pay for the DVD."
4,Proper wrestling & works in UK,"To be honest I bought this dvd without thinking... it looked a good buy and wasn't too expensive so, on impulse I went for it.A couple of days later it dawned on me that it probably wouldn't work, what with me living in the UK. Luckily however, I haven't had any trouble watching it (played on both my PS3 and PC).This dvd is never going to match the production of a WWE release. It's not filled with extra features, interviews or any of those montages which generic rock songs in the background... However, I would highly recommend this to anyone who just wants to chill out, sit back and watch some great wrestling matches."
4,Minus one star for Mick Foley.,"There are some great matches on this DVD, without the politics that go into the bigger wrestling promotions, but whose bright idea was it to put Mick Foley in ROH, a corporation known for wrestling and athleticism? Mick Foley is one of the most overrated wrestlers today, not to mention one of the most out-of-shape. Thank God he's no longer in ROH, and has taken his clowning antics to TNA."
1,dum de dum....,"I must admit that I dont like the spice girls. their musik is somewhat of a mix between the mating calls of a dying whale family and the sound of a hermaphroditic class cestoda inhabitent trocophore/bipinnaria/trilibita larva being squished to near death by a platyhelminthes inhabitent, such as the cross-eyed planaria. That is the image and sound that appear in my mind when I hear spice girls music. Thank you."
1,KINDLE EDITON IS TERRIBLE,"The kindle version of this book is terrible. The words are not on the page with the correct picture. Each picture is just a copy of the book with the text still visible but too small to read on the Kindle. They then put the text in bigger font with the next picture which doesn't even go with the words. Many pictures are seen multiple times, half of the picture here and then the whole picture. There is text on the illustrations and then the text repeated in the bigger font to read. Some text you will see three times (on the illustrations that are repeated and then again on the part that they typed in the bigger font to be read. It makes it very confusing to read."
5,The illustrations are priceless!,"A delightful retelling of the old story of the Three Billy Goats Gruff. This particular book stands out from all the others because of the illustrations, which are priceless! E.g., for the trip across the bridge, the bigger goats dress up the littlest one in a diaper; the biggest goat suits up in a black leather motorcycle jacket and dark glasses!The book is as much fun for grownups as it is for children!"
1,What the....!,"I grew up with this story - what happened?! Somewhere in this grossly underproduced version they forgot that even in a kids story you need talented actors. Kids know when someone sounds wooden and unskilled - and you can't pawn something as poorly done as this off on them. They're smarter than that! I could've done a better job in my garage. ""Under the bridge lived a troll..."" Come on!"
4,The 10156 Storehorse,"This saw house set is really great when doing a lot of working that could give a you a back ache on other sawhores. The extra height(36"") makes working easier. They are very stable provided you have a level work area as there is no adjustment for uneven ground. I use them quite often for a work table in the field. For storage there ability to be collapsed takes up very little room. Plus this makes them much easier to haul to the job site instead of large cumbersome ones. I have recommened these several times and will continue to do so in the future."
3,the killing beach,"It was okay, I have never heard of it brfore so that is why I wanted to review it. at time it seemed alittl slow but not that bad. I liked it."
3,title of review,"Somewhere between ambient drone and post-rock. Most of what stands out about this music is what it's lacking, which at any given moment is either melody, structure, or dynamics, often all three. Occasional inspired moments don't make up for the monotonous drudgery that makes up the majority of the album. All of these tracks are based around some trace of a good musical idea, but it always seems to lose it's impact quickly through the simple repetition it's subjected to. An inferior album to 2003's Pure Tone Audiometry. 7/10."
4,Great fit but too long for me.,"I am also 5 foot, but I have shorter legs and these jeans are about an inch and a half too long to wear with sneakers. They are the best fitting jeans, though, everywhere else but the length and I am seriously considering getting them shortened because they are so comfortable and fit nicely. I just wished they could make a shorter inseam."
5,Lee Jeans One True Fit,"I was very happy with this purchase - I was unable to find them in stores in petite lengths, and since they were replacements I had no problem with the sizing. So all around the purchase was very satisfactory."
2,a disappointment,"This book started off well, with beautiful descriptions of the Scottish coast and an island off the coast. I thought the novel was going to focus on that geographical area. But once the protagonists find one another and fall in love in the first chapter or two, the remaining hundreds of pages are about their angst. Scotland is not mentioned again. Not that it has to be, but why get the reader's expectations up with the initial setting. The characters also seemed stilted to me, with no gradual change that one likes to see as a book progresses. The mother, for instance, remained critical and aloof, the father invisible. Sorry, I can't recommend this one."
4,Really good,"I also found this planer for a very good price, and 24 inch capicty is useful, and a great time saver because it allows you to plane 2 or more boards at once. I just wish there were more speed rates like on the powermatics, but it is good and for the price supurb. Its a very solid tool with plenty of power and well worth is especialy for rough stock, and also saves alot of money."
3,Low-key conducting and a cautious singer in the Four Last Songs,"It's impossible to attempt a new version of Strauss's glorious Four Last Songs without coming up against equally glorious sopranos on the order of Schwarzkopf, Della Casa, Te Kanawa, Fleming, and Norman. However, even if you drop your standards quite a distance, Melanaie Diener is cautious to the point of timidity, and she has a hard time controlling the wobble in her otherwise attractive voice. She isn't helped by David Zinman's lackluster conducting. He must have made a devil's bargain for fame, buecause on this CD as well as his recent Mahelr offerings on RCA/BMG, he couldn't be more tepid and uninspired. Simon Fuchs, the soloist in the Oboe Concerto, raises the standard of musicality a few nothces higher, delivering an enjoyable reading that would have been all the better with an energetic condcutor.If you want these three late works on one CD, raise your sights to the heights and buy Karajan on budget DG."
1,Not enough info from Amazon,"Nowhere on the product description did it mention the content enclosed in the gift set, leading me to believe it was new or unique material. Unfortunately, it is 4 DVDs, one for each comic, 2 of which I already owned.Enlosed isWhite:Tater SaladCable Guy:Git-r-DoneFoxworthy-RedneckEngvall:Here's your sign"
4,Humorous book for poor college students!,"This book had lots of ideas, funny and practical, about how to feed yourself when you don't have any money. I thought it was a hoot, but the recipes were sometimes kind of gross. This book was a gift from my parents when I graduated from high school and now I am buying it for my friends who are graduating this year."
3,"Kula Shaker, please come home!","This is a very good record. That said, for leader Crispian Mills to disband Kula Shaker, one of, if not the greatest rock and roll band in the 1990's, in favor of this project, it doesn't make a lot of sense. For those keeping score, The Stone Roses made the same mistake a few years ago. Two amazing bands that let ego take center stage.There is very good musicianship and great melodic rock and roll songs on here but when listening to it in full, you can't help but wonder what this album would have been if Kula Shaker recorded it. I'm sorry but I don't normally yearn for the past unless it's warranted. It's warranted.Bottom line: It's still better than most new British rock and roll and certainly has it's merit being for the fact that all of this sound is driven by a power trio.Buy this record and hope for a Kula Shaker re-union. That band was simply magic. This band is a particle of that magic."
3,Crispian Mills at the helm,"With Kula Shaker, although there would be brief moments Crispian Mills would shine as a guitarist, I've always thought he never demonstrated his full potential. In the same way John Squire was given a wider latitude with The Seahorses, The Jeevas offers a vehicle where Mills can unload musical ideas. Lyrically '1-2-3-4' seems to gravitate towards themes of Americana. Musically the sound is of stripped-down bluesy Britpop, in the same vein as Cast, The Bluetones, and Ocean Colour Scene. Obviously The Jeevas aren't Kula Shaker, rather rootsy guitar-rock, abrasive energy, and sparkling melodies."
2,Not my type,"Kula Shaker was a great band, mixing pop with 70's influences in a cool spirit making the whole thing if not innovative very creative.The Jeevas uses the same influences, pop, 70's, but the songs are very classic, it could be any band!The jeevas produces a pop Dylan type of music, not very exciting but still well produced and well played.The quality is there so it's up to you to decide if you are willing to pay for more silly pop songs...far from Kula Shaker!"
3,"Not the greatest thing I've ever heard, but","..I can't believe people have reviewed this album and NOT mentioned the cover of The Undertones' ""You Got My Number""."
5,Coarse Sea salt,"Good moderately flavored salt for a bargain price. Our favorite use is in pasta and potato water, but is also great for bbq rub."
5,The Art of Sound,"A magical, mystical, powerful blend of sound that touched my mind, body and soul. This collection is a masterful blend and captures the essence of music as ... the art of sound."
5,Great CD,This is a great CD that contains all of their hits. Hard to review because it's all pre-released music.
3,great introduction to newbies,"if you are only familiar with everclear's hits on the radio , this is for you . everything you could want and a little more . as for hardcore fans , you are better off pulling out your CDs and making your own compilation .as for the reviewer ""chip1978"" somebody needs to be a little more educated on their classic rock .""the boys are back in town"" is NOT a Kiss cover , but in fact a Thin Lizzy cover. nice try chip , better luck next time ."
4,It's about time for a greatest hits album!,"I'm very pleased to see this album come out. Unfortunetly they did not put all the radio hits on here. However, the band is so underappreciated, hopefully this will bring them back into the spotlight. Hands down, they belong in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame. The 2 new unreleased tracks on here are awesome...can't wait for the new record! It's a shame that the band split but as long as they are all friends still that's cool. When is Everclear coming out w/ a DVD w/ all their videos?"
3,Good tunes,"This is a good cd though I thought I would have liked more of the songs based off the singles I'd heard before. All in all, if your a fan of them then you'll like it. Atleaast they have 20 songs on it."
4,"Fine anthology, w/ one serious reservation (no pun intended)","Velie has put together a fine anthology of all different genres of Native American literature. My one qualm is that in the first edition, published in '79 (I believe), a good many of the ""poems"" were represented by the work of Frances Densmore: transcribed into western musical notation, along with the original language lyrics, and with a glossary of the native words provided at the bottom of the page. In the revised edition, Densmore's transcriptions are replaced with simple translations presenting the poems as purely literary works. What's lost is the strong sense of these works as songs-- performances, communal play--and the necessity for the reader to get intimately involved in the work by using the glossary to translate the song for him or herself. The new edition's translations also give no clue about the nonsense syllables the singer often slips in between the syllables of a native word--a kind of Indian doo-wop or hey-nonny-nonny."
3,good book,This wasw a great book it came to me fast and was in good condition just like it said very happy with purchase
5,Only ones that agreed with me while pregnant,"I took these while pregnant and am still taking them while nursing. They are bigger because the vitamins are taken from food versus created in a lab. The concept behind that is that your body will be able to absorbe the vitamins better. I generally don't like taking vitamins because they make me extra thirsy, and these do too (I think it is the diretic effect of B vitamins). But they are the best vitamins I have found for myself. I have taken the non-prenatal multivitamins too and I like those as well."
5,my favorite prentals,"I've taken prenatals for many years now between pregnancy, nursing and during fertility treatments, and these are by far mt favorite. I can really tell a difference in my energy levels and also my overall health."
1,Would not purchase Vitamins,"When I received these vitamins in the mail there was a warning message on the bottle that stated: ""This product contains lead, a substance known to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm."" Upon reading this message there was no way I was taking these vitamins. I returned the product on 16 October and have yet to receive a refund from the seller over a month later. I would not recommend purchasing these prenatal vitamins. Poor customer service."
3,kapoosh,"it does hold lots of knives, but it's still not deep enough to completely enclose 10-inch tools. so it works okay but is a little disappointing."
1,Do not buy this product.. No stars,I thought this block was cool and would solve my knife storage problems. Well it did for about a month. With regular use knives with blunt ends like cleavers bend and break the rods making it impossible to get the knives back. And very sharp knives DO cut right thru the rods leaving shortened rods that bend and turn the middle of the rods into a birds nest. The block looks like a cool invention but it doesn't work yet. I wasted $40 bucks on the stainless steel model.
2,"Works great at first, not so great after a while","I bought this at a brick and mortar. It worked great for a while and, as others have said, it's nice because you can fit all shapes and sizes of knives. After a bit, however, the ""rods"" start to compact and it makes inserting anything next to impossible. This leaves the blade exposed which is dangerous when you're trying to grab other knives. I've removed everything and cleaned it, but there is no way to straighten the rods.Other issues, stainless is low-grade, but it's what you get for $50. Rubber feet on the bottom keep popping out if you move the block around. Knives sit at a fairly high angle, so if you plan on putting it under any standard-height cabinets, you will be moving it in and out a lot, reinserting the rubber feet often.I think I'm being pretty generous with two stars for this review."
5,Get More Referrals Now: Excellent,"This was one of the best books I have ever read on getting referrals (and I have read quite a few). Although it does cover other industries, the focus is on financial services practioners, particularly independant financial planners, and insurance sales people. The principles apply to every one who would like to grow their business using referrals."
2,Not for startups.,"This book ""might"" help you if you are already an established business. But if you are just starting one, forget it. Why? Because you have no customers that can refer you to anybody!It's also a summation of many of the business proverbs that we already know :- be nice to your customers- ask them how you can better serve them- and don't forget to ask them for referralsThat's about it.I'll give the book two stars because I always do for any book that at least introduces me to one new idea. And that new idea for this book is -- don't ever argue with your customer! Use their objections to how you are failing them as an opportunity to do better by them. Put your ego in your pocket and LISTEN to them instead of making excuses for your lack of performance.In that sense, you will have gotten the entire message of this book. 'Nuff said."
5,"Excellent book. A ""must read"" for all financial professinals","Bill Cates is the difinitive authority within the financial services sector for the art and science of getting referrals. This is a book that you will (or should) read multiple times to employ different strategies as you advance throughout your careet.Getting qualified referrals is the best way to build your business, and this book shows you how. The book, as well as Bill's courses, also provide excellent tips to ensure that you are ""referrable.""I give this book my highest recommentation.Steven DrozdeckAuthor, coach, trainer"
5,Best referral book ever,This book has completely revolutionized the way I'm building my business. I have generated so many referrals that it's hard to keep on top of them. This book is easy to follow and can help anyone take their business to the next level.
4,A delicious Habit,"Mike Manno has written an engaging piece of detective fiction. While it may not rank as a classic of American literature it is a good read. The characters are engaging and believable, from the grumbling and tenacious Parker Noble, the frequently frustrated Stan and the seemingly ""dittzie"" Buffy Coyle, who in the end is nobodies fool. The character work together well to weave a genuine American detective novel complete with a suprise ending, numerous ""red herrings"", and a generous dose of legal information from the author/attorney. After finishing the book I was left wanting to read more of these characters. I do hope Manno writes a few sequels. This is an eclectic three-some that begs for more cases, but maybe with the addition of yet another character; Parkers intreped pooch ""Buckwheat Bob"", the wonder dog (Bassethound). My only criticism to the author would be...""don't leave us hanging. Give us some more!"""
2,The Muppets Take Copenhagen,"OK - it's not as if Galaxie 500's live show ever was much to brand with superlatives. Check out Damon & Naomi's modern-day wankfests for evidence (and bring me back some Romilar as a souvenir ... zzzz ... ). Aside from serving some sentimental purpose for the G500 folks now moping through middle age, ain't much this CD, documenting the band's final European performance, has to offer. Like most live recordings, the bass is mixed too high, the guitars too low in some sort of a jagged murk, the vocals from some cave north of Omsk. And those voices - yeesh, and this is when Wareham's forlorn whininess actually sounded most at home. On ""When Will You Come Home,"" though, it sounds as if he's been hanging out in the kitchen with the Swedish Chef and a puppeteer has a hand up his rear. The covers (Yoko Ono, George Harrison) are interesting in and of themselves, but God bless y'all if you see the need to listen to them more than once."
5,Sony MCR-156A,"Great Item,but often hard to locate. Seller gave very fast delivery. Product in its self is very unique because the camera records its pictures directly to this 8cm CD. The pictures on the CD are very clear and you can get alot of pictures on the CD."
5,Thorough and Thought Provoking,"I have read Bible commentaries from several different series and this is the best. The book blends passages from other Gospels and nonbiblical historical facts to put the Gospel of Matthew in perspective. It is as much history as interpretation and explanation. Many commentaries are too academic, making it difficult for the lay reader. I found this book easy to follow, and even entertaining with the use of constant aliterations. It provided a good foundation for understanding both this and the other Gospels. I will buy other books in this series."
4,"good, but could be better","i enjoy this commentary because it is concise. it gives you help on some difficult passages in the gospel. however, if you want something a little more in depth, i would go with john macarthur's commentary on matthew"
2,Not the same as Bawls Mints,"Warning: These look like Bawls Mints, but they've changed the formula-- not just the name. It's like ""New"" Coke-- don't expect to like these if you loved the original. The flavor is quite different; it's not a subtle change. I absolutely loved Bawls Mints, so I am really stunned to regret this purchase. =("
1,Major change in formula,"These do not taste like the original bawls, they don't have the fizz like the original bawls, nor are they hard like the original bawls.These new ones are softer than any hard-candy I've ever had. They have brown specks in them, is this a defect? Very bad change."
5,Minty caffeine fizzy goodness in a tin,A refreshing fizzy mint loaded with caffeine in a small tin container. What more could one ask for in a mint?
1,Not *the* Wavy Gravy,"This is music, more or less. It has nothing to do with our friend from Woodstock, the Ultimate Clown. With no information given about this disc, I fell for it. My mistake. It's an OK coaster, except for that big hole in the middle."
3,Materials Science Made Simple,"Optimistic, easy-to-read, this charming history of the effect of new materials on society is filled with brilliant analogies. From the ceramics and bronze of prehistoric times through iron, steel, aluminum, polymers, transistors, silicon microchips and solid-state lasers, using personal interviews and a number of diagrams, Amato takes the reader on a joyful tour of what became Materials Science. This fount of good (but not excellent) explanations of many things is marred by a number of technical errors, and a Green Party stance on all of the current environmental issues. These flaws drag down what would have been a 5-star rating to 3 stars. The generally delicious writing style is marred by some problems with transitive verbs and a few slang expressions that may be hard to translate. Citation of sources is adequate...."
2,Nothing great,"There's nothing terribly wrong with this book, but unfortunately it came out at about the same time as Phillip Ball's vastly superior ""Made to Measure,"" which covered the same ground, at least as regards technology. Mr. Amato must be one of the few people on Earth who can be so awestruck by a technical conference -- he devotes at least an entire chapter to the thrill and wonder of a Materials Research Society meeting, which is, well, just a technical conference."
2,Fuzzy mess,"I have just recently bought this album at a very low price, yet the sound is terrible, bob mould's singing is drowned out by an undistuinguishable mass of overdone instrumentation and fuzz. There are maybe 3 or 4 redeemable songs on here, but overall a near disaster of an album."
4,Lost Gem,"Wow. Popped this disc in last night after 5 years and damn it's good. Sure the programmed drums sound a little stiff, but that's what makes this disc so freaking great....it's not perfect and it's the work of a great artist trying to do it all himself for the first time. GREAT tunes on this disc with exception of 2 or 3 duds. MUCH better than LDAPS which sounded pretty generic."
2,Not his best,"For me, Bob Mould is right up there with Lennon, Westerberg, and Dylan as fas as songwriters go. But he missed the mark on this one. Musically it's uninspired, despite a few flashes of brilliance (""The Next Time That You Leave,"" ""I Hate Alternative Rock""), but lyrically it's fairly clever still. This sounds like an album he could have written and recorded in a week.Production-wise, it's a step backward from his earlier efforts. He's not good at producing himself. More often than not, the drums get lost, the guitar's too far out front and the vocal is self-consciously buried in the mix."
2,Cups Not Durable,"The cups provided with this set are not durable. Several of the cups were broken and cracked after only a week of use. My son loves to participate in speed stacking at his school and brings home a different brand of cups to practice. These have never broken. Save your money, and purchase a more durable brand."
4,Great video game alternative,"I bought this game for my 11 year old nephew that prefers video games to just about anything else in life. He's glued to any video device for hours to the exclusion of all else. He really took to this game, and he's amazingly fast. He enjoyed the challenge of being able to best his own time AND he more enjoyed whopping up on the rest of use. The kid is super fast. The timing device is easy to use and is placed in front of you at the base of the mat. It makes it easy to start/stop the timer. I really like that the game rolls up into a reasonable sized roll for transport. This game easily entertained all the kids ages 6-13 at our family reunion for hours, and sucked in the ""big kids""/adults just as readily. Good for family fun."
1,Not Paramahansa Yogananda's Kriya Yoga,"I've seen Norman Paulsen's video and read the book that goes with it, The Sacred Science of Meditation. If you're looking for the Kriya Yoga that Paramahansa Yogananda taught then please look into getting the ""real thing"" through the organization Yogananda himself founded for disseminating his teachings including Kriya, the Self Realization Fellowship of Los Angeles, CA. Norman Pausen tries to use Yogananda's name to give his own teaching some clout. Why he would even refer to himself as a direct disciple of Yogananda and yet change Kriya with his own innovations is beyond me. Loyalty and having a Guru like Yogananda are an essential part of the Kriya Yoga path. Norman Paulsen has said in his advertisements that this his own technique is the ""complete kriya yoga"". Don't be deceived. If you want to get the Kriya technique of Yogananda then call Self Realization Fellowship."
3,Not what I expected.,This is a video of a gentleman speaking to a group of people. I'm a little disappointed because he is hard to listen to because he doesn't speak English the best and because I was looking for notes or something specific --- not a DVD of a speaker.
4,A Title,Excellent but old! A must have for any John Wayne collector. One of the B rated for sure but still one of the early ones.
5,This band did it right,"Cranked out 3 albums and were done with it. And, apparently, made the music they wanted to make. Signature tunes are soaring and sad at the same time. So many good songs on these discs-- Blue Thunder, When Will You Come Home, Plastic Bird, Tugboat, 4th of July, Oblivious-- shoot, everything they did is good, good.Saw a car commercial the other day, the music playing in the background was ""Instrumental"" from _Today_."
1,Installation nightmare,"Tried installing on two computers with no luck. Went to Pinnacle website and downloaded driver, still no luck. Clobbered existing USB drivers."
1,Dazzle DVC-120 F.O.D.,This is a piece of FOD (Foreign Object Debris--destroys jet engines) installation was heinous and never worked even after the 67MB patch download.DON'T BUY IT!!!! AMAZON...LOSE IT!
5,A safety capsule for parents !,"This is a brilliant guide for parents who may be starting to realise that they cannot change their teenager but that somehow they need to do something different themselves . Good solid advice and what is almost a workbook for adressing a wide range of teenage related difficulties. I found ideas in here that helped a lot when I had teenagers and as a therapist it is a book I recommend to clients ! It is the best practical book on the topic that I have come across.It addresses well the issues of responsability , control and values as they relate to struggling with one's teenage kids !"
4,Extremely useful and thorough guide,"Once again I used one of Rick Steves' guides as a resource for mytrip. Once again, I found it to be thorough and extremely practical in making my selections throughout the journey."
5,Inspirational to hardcore aquarists,This book is beautiful. The photography is incredible.Amano is the master of aquarium design and it shows in his photos.This is the kind of book that you will pick up over and over again. And each time you will notice some new subtlety that you can incorporate in your aquascapes.
4,#1 para siempre,Cada cancion tiene algo especial. Marco Antonio Solis nunca faya. Puedo escuchar el album todo el dia y no me fastidio. Buen trabajo Buki!
5,Marco Marco bueno!,"As a person that is not fluent in Spanish I discovered Marco's music when he released Si No tu Hubieras Ido in 1999. This haunting song intrigued me to the point that since that time I have almost all of his music. Marco is a phenomenal composer, and song writer. His lyrics are so romantic and full of emotion. I had the pleasure to see him perform live and his strong voice is as mesmerizing live as it is on cd. Te Amo Marco !"
2,Poor DVD for Armchair Traveller!!!,This DVD was really designed for stationary biking but as an armchair traveller I found this to be very poor.The music as mentioned by others had no flow to it and was rather cheesy at times.The imagery was not bad but a little unsteady at times.I actually found it quite boring and had to speed-play thru most of it.
5,Good Refresher To Shakespeare,Its been almost 13 years since I had the pleasure of enjoying Russ McDonald's insight on Shakespeare first hand and it was a pleasure re-engaging with his wit and insight again via this text.
3,Will never read cover to cover,"This book was purchased for a college class, but by the end, our class had decided this book wasn't the most helpful for studying Shakespeare. Though it became necessary to write a paper for the class, there was no other use for this. The essays didn't add to our study the way anyone felt they would. Though it's better than other companions I have seen."
2,"Too long and kind of boring, actually",Too long and very dull. Could have been more exciting for sure. I don't know if I would recommend this.
5,Excelente calidad,"Muy buen disco, excelente musica de Amaury Gutierrez, uno de los mejores cantautores de habla hispana, ganador del prestigioso premio Grammy."
3,Not quite the horse's mouth...,"`The Boss' certainly helps the reader to bridge the gap between the application of Machiavelli's observations and lessons for the leaders of the warring independent states of Renaissance Italy, to today's business world. However, Richard W. Hill is somewhat selective in the topics he uses to illustrate the usefulness of Machiavell's book `Il Principe' for the business leaders of today. He sometimes also `stretches' his metaphors, for instance when he claims a company's sales force to be the exact equivalent of a city-state's army. This leads to the impression that Mr. Hill may have used `Il Principe' to substantiate and illustrate lessons he himself learned from being in business, instead of the other way around. Therefore, I would probably recommend the reader to (also) read the original and construct your own translations."
2,Is He Serious?,"I know he won a Grammy for this album, but man, you should have heard him when he wasn't playing elevator music. This album is pure truck-stop lounge-lizard snoozarama. Dave may be an exceptional song writer, but the boy CAN'T SING! Although if you think about it, neither can Bob Dylan, but the cirtics love him no matter what lands on the vinyl. Don't get me wrong, Dave Alvin's music has inspired many great musicians whom everyone's heard of. Unfortunately, I believe ALvin's name recognition has now surpassed his actual talent."
3,I love the rumble of Dave Alvin's voice...,"I love the rumble of Dave Alvin's voice... the way the some of his songs either feel like they've been around forever or just give me goosebumps. He's a great American song writer and incredible performer & really has THE voice. All I can say is that if these are the songs that influenced Dave, MAN has he taken things a step further in his own songwriting. There is nothing here that can stand up to his own songs... If you dug the Harry Smith anthology this'll put the starch in your pants, if not try another Dave Alvin record. I always like listening to Dave, but this won't be one that I return to frequently."
5,Dave Alvin puts his private touch on Public Domain,"Fans of Dave Alvin will not be disappointed, and those who don't know his work should rush to pick this up. American Music king Dave Alvin, formerly of The Blasters (with his brother Phil singing lead), X, and The Knitters, digs into the back of his record bin for this collection of some of his favorite songs that obviously shape his songwriting. It's easy to imagine young Dave, gleefully hearing these tunes for the first time, just as I found myself gleefully listening to his versions. Dave Alvin proves himself a great interpreter with this collection, adding one more title to his Singer/Songwriter/Historian moniker.P.S. If you haven't yet caught him live, get to the club next time he is in your town."
4,several outstanding performances on this record,"I'm not crazy about Alvin's rumbling baritone but there are some fine renditions of 'Maggie Campbell', 'Delia' (better than Dylan's 1993 version), 'Texas Rangers', and 'A Short Life of Trouble'. The production is almost too modern and the bluegrass-inflected tracks lack swing. But the good tracks are worth the buy."
2,Oh Dave!,I have dug Dave Alvin for years from his work with the Blasters to his solo and production work on Katy Moffat and others .But truthfully this one misses the boat!Sorry Dave your stories are told better by you when you penn them than by you singing classics!
4,Back Porch Summer Evening,"If kd lang's INVINCABLE SUMMER is like a summer afternoon drinking lemonade under a share tree, then PUBLIC DOMAIN is a summer evening on the back porch with old friends playing and singing. There are light tunes on here that are just fun to listen to, sing along if you want, like Railroad Bill or Walk Right In. They aren't the usual rich sound or lyrics for those familar with Dave Alvin songs. There are other songs on here that earlier traveling troubadours of the American West would surely have sung around summer evening campfires, like A Short Life of Trouble. Personally, I found Sheneandoah, Murder of The Lawson Family, and Sign of Judgement to be hauntingly beautiful being sung in that soulfully rich Dave Alvin voice. The tunes, characters and the struggles of love, loss, sadness and joy are familar enough to us and brought back to life in this classic collection done in classic style. Pull up a chair on the back pourch and sing along."
5,"Not cheap, but you get what you pay for","There are similar sets that are much cheaper, and to be honest I haven't tried them, so maybe they're as good, but I read good reviews about this one, and in the couple of times I've used it, it's been truly amazing. This saves so much time having to change bits to drive pilot hole after pilot hole. Did I mention these are not cheap?"
5,"wm425, workmate","This project center is a real helpmate. It took awhile to put together, but was worth it. Its versatility is a nice surprise. It can be raised to different work-heghts, AND folded flat to hang on a wall, and all the adjustments that can be made to hold projects of all sizes is amazing. It will hold my new miter saw AND my sewing machine. It couldn't get better than that."
3,Decent work bench for money,"I'm only giving this three stars because of the clamping force. I realy wish they used something other than the plastic ribbon to open and close the table. If you try to exert too much clamping force it jumps out of hole keeping you from clamping further. It still appears to hold items in place so I guess I can't complain too much. I love how this folds down to small area, I have limited storage space in my home so this is very handy for me. Overall a great tool for the money."
1,Workmate 425 - DO NOT BUY!,"Shame on B&D for selling a piece of junk mechanical bench. AND shame on me for not looking at all of the reviews to understand the difference from the original workmate. I own an original and expected good quality. Why would a company change from a WINNER to such a POOR LOSER? Cheap metal, rough cut in places, thin cheap wood compared to the originals, an adjustment system that is based on a PLASTIC belt (wow!) and handles that adjust as one. I have read that if you crank the handle that would tighten on the smaller end of an angled piece of wood, the wider side slips off of the plastic crank and when the board is almost tightened you use both handles to tighten securely. Doesn't sound good to me. I would have rather spend a little more for the old original workmate than this piece of junk. I will be buying a ""jawhorse"" and sell this new workmate on craigslist."
5,Nice Workbench,Makes so many jobs easier. Feels very sturdy for the most part. Fun to finagle a way to get projects to fit. Only minor complaint is that getting the legs to softly lock in when setting it up is a little tricky.
3,Workmate WM485,"Instructions to assemble are not very good. You need to set up the table for multi uses. Fairly stable.I would recommend it for amateurs not professionals who will use it a lot, lot more than I will."
3,Beats using a pair of horses,"It's ""OK"", and beats using a pair of horses with an old door on top. But that's about it. I was surprised to see that the ""chain"" used for the vise hand cranks was perforated vinyl tape. That being said, you can't grip anything real tight, because the sprockets will slip in the holes.If you are over 5' tall, the optional leg extensions are a necessity. Without using them, you'll end up with a major back ache from bending so low."
4,Black and Decker WM425,Its ok it is not as good as its predecessor but its alright the mechanism that works both cranks at the same time is a little wiggie but other than than that works ok
2,Beware this product,"Here's a couple of things the pictures won't tell you:1) The vise handle, track and pin and quite loose and plastic. Once you install the handles on the item you can't take them apart again as they are held in with pins you have to hammer in.2) The area between the two ends on the vise planks opens only between 4-6 inches so you can only hold something thats between 4-6 inches wide3) The alignment on mine was off by about 1/4"" which is a lot considering it's supposed to double as a vise4) Overall I'd say this item is not really suitable for any kind of serious work. Might be good as a kid's play thing"
2,Old Workmate vs New,I had an original workmate for almost 25 years. When I moved a few years ago I gave it to my son who had just purchased his first house. Now 5 years later I really miss that old workmate. So I decided to replace it and purchased a new WM425 from Home Depot. It promised to be everything the old one was and more. WRONG!! What a piece of crap compared to the original. It's built out of stamped metal instead of heavier gauge aluminum and is not at all easy to unfold. The worst feature is the vise action which is not as tight or precise as the original. The 2 handles are joined by a cheap light plastic perforated strap so that both sides tighten (sort of) at the same time. This eliminates the possibility of clamping pieces whose sides aren't parallel. So it's going back to HD and my son and I will be having joint custody of the old Workmate.
3,Quality has slipped,"I bought this unit to replace my (several) year old (and failing) Workmate bench. To say the new units are not built as well as the older units is something of an understatement.The top attachment is not as goodThe alignment of the screw (clamps) is not as good.The list goes on and onBut, it's still a useful item"
5,tried and true,"I've had my workmate since 1988. It's moved all over the place with me, I've used it to build everything imaginable, I've cut wood with it, steel with it. I even used it to hole a piece of steel tubing the other day while I cut it with my hot wrench (of course gotta stay away from the top). I've used it has a saw horse, the clamps to put wood together, all kinds of stuff. It's one of the best items I own. I was trying to figure out how to build a folding workbench for my woodshop, maybe I'll just buy another one of these!!"
2,Do your own quality control,"Fortunately the unit I purchased was not in as bad a shape as units others received. The wooden slats were splintering in places but not warped. The unit is minimalist, not in terms of design but of quality. If it were made properly - heavier metal, vise mechanism more robust, better wooden slats, it could probably command twice the price at Amazon and be worth it. Unfortunately, it is made as a semi-disposable unit probably not the result of being made in China but of what B & D dictated as cost. The instructions for assembly are close to useless - figures misnumbered and not very informative. Made instructions from IKEA look like a Mercedes service manual."
1,Cheap plastic handles that break,"Had this product for a about 3 years - got it from Lowes for about $55 at the time. It's not very sturdy, and the hand cranks that move the vise are made of plastic - they broke within the first year. I've had to rig it in various ways to keep the vise function working. I would not buy it again due to its cheap parts."
5,Black and Decker Workmate,"This is a replacement for one I earlier had lent to my son that somehow has not found its way back home! The Workmate is such a hand convenience in the shop, the home or at the work site. It is solidly built, but yet very portable and in it's collapsed state takes up very little space. I use it as a table for all sorts of functions or as a vice for clamping all sorts of items that I may be working on. It is very stable in any of these modes. This is a most useful accessory for any home owner or wood worker.......I even use it for working on my racing bicycle!"
2,Workmate portable,"I bought this portable workbench for my son who has just moved into his first home. I have used one of these workbenches for more than 30 years and it has been an exceptional, convenient tool. Sadly, the new model does not come close to the older version. It is relatively flimsy, the vise works ineffectively, and it does not provide as stable a work platform. Cheaper materials; less solid manufacture; useful for its portability, but a pale imitation of a one time flagship product."
1,Horrible Experience,Purchased this as a Christmas gift for someone and am glad that I decided to assemble it. They instructions did not match the version of the product in the box and it had lots of missing parts. I RETURNED IT.
2,"Nice, but","As others have commented - I can't believe the problems has still not been addressed - my flimsy package arrived in shreds with the workbench damaged. Amazon promptly replaced it. Assembling the unit is simple, especially if you ignore the somewhat obtuse instructions, but the tool supplied for tightening the bolts is best replaced with a socket wrench as the bolts were nearly impossible to tighten with the supplied tool.Otherwise, the unit seems quite convenient for light duty work and stores easily. Construction is a bit cheesy, but the unit is serviceable."
1,"Cheap and flimsy, nebulous instructions",I could not believe that this was actually a B&D product. It is cheap and flimsy and the assembly instrucions are nearly impossible to follow. The jaws do not close properly nor do they fit tightly. The plastic assembly wrench is totally useless. What a piece of junk.
2,Heavy Safety Hazard,I have had this workmate 425 for a year and a half. In that amount of time the center part has fallen out on somebody's footThree times.You have really tighten it down to prevent this fromhappening. Also the short legs on the bottom have collapsed twicecausing it to fall on my foot. This needs to be enginered better.It is to heavy. Other than those problems it work's ok.Don't standon top of this table because of the leg problem.
2,pre-assembly,I HAVE JUST GOTEN AROUND TO TRYING TO ASSEMBLE THE PRODUCT-ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS ARE VAGUE AND NOT CLEAR BUT THE MAIN PROBLEM I HAVE IS SOME PARTS SHOWN ON THE INCLUDED PARTS LISTS ARE MISSING SO I CAN NOT ASSEMBLE THE PRODUCT AT THIS TIME
4,Product Good Shipping Delayed,"""Free Shipping"" ""5-9 Days"" WOW, but it took 5 days to get it into the shipping!!"
3,Item received NOT as pictured,"Looking at the 425 workmate as depicted in the add would lead one to believe that the work top surface was some sort of metal. The product I received, while it meets all of the descriptions in the add, has a wood work top surface. I'm not sure yet if that makes a difference since I've only used the unit twice so far.Also, the instructions that came with the unit described mostly how to assemble it and not very much as to what it can be used for and how to use it."
1,Package Appears to be Lost,"This package was supposed to arrive on September 9th.I can track it to Memphis, at which point it disappears.I did not see an easy way to contact Customer Service regarding this package.Thus, I am using this feed back."
3,Good idea - but flimsy,"Maybe I was expecting a bit much for the price, but this table wasn't sturdy enough to be very useful. It is made of stamped sheet metal and has nylon threads. If you try to clamp anything with much force the threads just strip or jump."
1,Not for the serious DIYer!,"Very poorly constructed. Flimsy sheet metal. Catches on the underside of the jaws do not engage securely into the holes in the frame. Adjusting screws were poorly aligned so that the first attachment of the moveable jaw left it crooked and required some disassembly and adjusting on my part. Reasonably sturdy with all 4 legs on a flat floor, but I suspect it will prove wobbly on an uneven surface. Definitely not for the serious DIYer who works with heavier items. Next time I would look for something much sturdier. Made in China."
4,Compare the WM 425 vs the WM 225. I prefer the small one.,"Great product, but it weighs almost 35 lbs. For me and I think for most people, the small one, which weighs 20 lbs, is more practical.Both WorkMates are easy to assemble and to use. Both are extremely stable and can be used with the feet extended or folded under. This model (the bigger WM 425) has a one hand clamping system. Nice to have, but not essential for most tasks. This WorkMate's kid brother, theBlack & Decker WM225 Workmate 225 450-Pound Capacity Portable Work Bench, works just as well but is much easier to carry.If I were going to use a WorkMate as a permanent base for a chop saw or a router bench, I might get the heavy one, but as a portable workbench, which is where this tool shines, the small one costs less and is more practical, IMHO."
3,A mere shadow of it's former self,"I owned one of the original Workmates, given as a gift some 30+ years ago. I thought the top of the line model might be the same. No chance. This will be a good tool, and I will use it. However, the cost improvements over the last 30 years are sad. There are too many plastic components in the clamping assembly. If you crank it too tight you will break the mechanism. The way it holds a piece of pipe is weak. It's not what I wanted. Oh well."
2,Don't buy this if you're expecting a quality product,"I just finished putting this together. Once I was able to parse the sparsely-detailed instructions, it went together fairly quickly, with no 'extra' parts remaining. That's a plus.However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the materials used to construct this product, and the overall design. With the exception of six bolts, the bench is held together with plastic fasteners that will lose integrity in a relatively short time-span, especially under heavy use. Cheap metal, particle board and plastic are poor choices for workbench fabrication. Personally, I wouldn't trust anything weighing anywhere near 500 pounds sitting on this bench. I really don't expect that it will last long.On hindsight, the money would have been better spent on quality lumber and hardware."
5,Nice,Great work bench. It can be used for so many things. I bought as gift for my husband. Light and easy to move around.
2,TERRIBLE directions!,My husband has two years of draft school and a year of tool and die and it took him an hour and a half to put this together.... IN fact I had amazon on the line trying to return it when he finally figured out that the direction in figure 6 was incorrect. He says the directions are TERRIBLE and that it was made cheaply as some pieces don't fit together well. (So glad I got a black Friday deal on it!) It even showed up with some rust on part of it.Needless to say the two star rating will remain until he has tried to actually do work on it.
3,Good for what you pay,"Very easy assembly, nice portable easy to move. The only drawback was the locking mechanism to keep the vice parts engaged, sometimes they would slip, I think thats due to the plastic vs metal gear holes for rotating the knobs."
2,Black & Decker WM425 Workmate Portable Workbench,"Assembly was quite easy. However, the plastic belt that controls the vise jaw was damaged upon delivery. I called Black and Decker about this issue on Nov 15, 2012. The representative said the belt for Workmate WM425 is on back order. I told her to order it for me anyway. To date I have not received the belt. The belt does not show on the parts listing nor in the assembly manual. Not having the belt in stock suggests to me that it may be a common problem item experienced by users of this portable workbench."
4,Black and Decker Workmate 425,"Putting this item together was a daunting task until I finally looked at the picture of the assembly on the packing box and figured it out. It's too bad that the instruction sheet didn't have the same picture. Pounding in the capture pins on the two handles was a bit difficult, but I figured out how to do that too.It's a fairly heavy duty work bench and folds up flat for ease of storing. I needed such an item and was pleased with it. The price was also reasonable.RMT"
2,Bad packaging - bad instructions - disappointed,"Shipped in the single ply cardboard display box - the same one on the floor at Home Depot. Boards chipped in typically careless UPS handling.Instructions in about 20 languages, none of them helpful in getting the top pieces to align properly. (Gee, and I used to do well on spatial relationship test ;-)Main complaint is the shipping. Suggest buying th product locally if possible so you can take it back if you have the same experience of putting it together and will at least receive it without damage."
2,New Models Lack Strength of Old Ones,"I have an old Workmate (10 years old) that has been pretty good. It has a couple parks that have worn out, such as the mechanism that holds it in it's compact form when not in use, but over all it have been a great tool.My in-laws gave me a new one last Christmas and it was much more flimsy and was even missing parts out of the box. My wife called Black and Decker and they said it commonly happens and we should reveive the pieces we need within a few weeks. Well, it's June and still no parts. Granted, I should have followed up with them by now. Even with all the parts, the units are much less sturdy now than a few years ago. Back then their usability justified their cost. Now, that is simply not the case."
4,B&D Workmate 425,"I have used this product for about 15 years. My old one had a small worktop and required the use to two separate latches for setup and takedown. It was so old the rubber feet were gone and the legs didn't work right. My experience with these units has been excellent. It folds up compactly, fits in a small space and doesn't weigh very much. It works well. I like it and have two of the 425s'. In my comparisons with competitive products or other models in the B&D line I would again pick this unit first."
2,"Wow, what a disappointment!","I have one of the original aluminum die-cast Workmates (made in Great Britain in the 70's) that had seen its better day. So I went with this ""updated"" model from Black & Decker. What a joke and an extremely poor excuse for ""progress"". It's mostly made of cheap stamped metal and plastic parts that make for a very rickety and unstable platform that is a mere wisp of the original Workmate. It came damaged, and I have since had to replace several plastic parts to keep it some form of working order (such as it is). When I finally get some time, I am going to refurbish my old Workmate and junk this POS."
2,WM 425 Review,Diffuicult to put together. Wood work surface difficult to attach to table base with plastic units. Adjusting cranks with thin plastic drive belt was flimsy/cheap. Not very reliable. Wonder how long the crank system will last. Very disappointed.
2,Not the best...,"Service and Delivery were great as always w. Prime. The product is not as solid as I thought it would be. The ""vise"" capability is a joke as the two screws dont want to work together evenly and smoothly. The workmate has been around for a long time, I remember the one my dad had, seemed very solid and well built. I would have thought that 20 years later the product would be much better than or at least as good as that 20 year old beauty, dad had. Nope...this thing is a flimsy imitation of that old workhorse. As a portable work surface, it does provide a solid tip free worktable and was stable on the patio pavers as well as concrete. It's just not as solid or well built as I had expected. There must be better out there.....will keep looking."
5,""" well worth the price """,I was alittle hesitant to order this bench as I had owned one 25 years ago and while happy then I thought maybe the quality would not be the same in this current bench. I am pleased to so far Iam no longer hesitant about my decision and would recommend to anyone to order it.
4,WM425,I was glad to see that the manufacturer improved the shipping box. I was a little concerned about how it would arrive. It made it in great shape. It is easy to assemble if you throw away the little plastic wrench and use a socket gently. Over all I like it.
2,Not built for long term use,"If you buy this keep it safe from the elements. The cheap plastic ""chain"" that operates the cranks failed on mine along with the plastic lock for the legs. And the press-board top is cheap as well. Otherwise a nice helpful workbench if you can store it in your house to make it last longer."
3,Work Bench delivery and set up,"I received the product in the original package this afternoon with no damage evidenced from the transport. There was no damage to the frame or wooden jaws.I expected to have a problem with the instructions after I read the reviews and was not disappointed. These directions without a doubt rank as the worst I have ever seen. Only after looking at the picture on the box and trial and error, I was able to assemble the unit in about 1 .5 hours. But most people will probably figure things out much faster than me. I am still not sure about the installation of the top jaws.I think that the unit is a fair value.I believe the product will serve the purpose I need it for so was willing to put up with the fustration of the instructions and quality of the wooden panels. After all, it only cost around $120 dollars compared to the $500 Festool multipurpose table."
5,Black & Decker WM 425 Work Bench,This table is a great little work table/bench for the money. Its excellent for working on big or small projects and is very sturdy. I would buy another one.
2,"B&D Workmate arrived damaged, has some ""cheapo"" features","The product arrived damaged and it wasn't evident 'till the final step in the assembly process. I had to adjust (bend) part of the Workmate to install one of the handles. It would have taken another hour to take it apart and repackage it, then arrange for return or replacement.I wouldn't purchase something like this on the web again."
4,stronger clamping would be nice,"No problems with the bench, other than the clamping part could be stronger. Easy to put together, but go slowly and pay attention. I think I have installed something backward initially. Instructions could be clearer. I wish there were a different kind of removable ""stop"" available, as the hard plastic ones don't grip your work well. Overall, I'm happy with it, but it could use some improvement."
4,Nice unit.,"This workbench arrived in great shape for such a large box, easy to put together, sturdy enough base. Two of the table top pieces were warped about 1/8"", very hard to un-warp these laminated pieces. The lack of surface flatness has not been an issue for me so far, I'm just clamping 2X4's & larger wood with it. Feels like it will hold up to it's rated weight capacity for sure. Not a bad unit for <$100."
4,Great Product ...,"I used to live in England and had one of the original workmates (before they were manufactured by B&D) which lasted for years. When I moved back to the States I bought two from Amazon. The quality and features of the 425 are both different and improved. The chipboard table is not as robust as the original plywood, but the adjustment is better. ..."
3,usefulness,"To be quite honest, this is not as good as I expected. I had an old B&D; Workmate which was Much more functional than this one. Rather disappointed with Functionality and practicality of this unit.Not as Sturdy and easy to use, Live and Learn"
4,"Great product, terrible instructions to put it together",To get started you put the first top board on. It goes on the end where the step is so you can read the print on it. To get it on properly u have to use the '2 front blocks' and not what B&D says in their instructions. They say to use 2 of the '4 top blocks'. NOT! The white plastic parts on the front where the adjustment handles get installed come in one piece and come off with a screwdriver. After you get the hardware installed on the other 2 top boards they just slip out depending on what you want to support.
3,It's OK.,"I have a original Black & Decker Workmate (purchased mid -1990's) that finally ""wore out."" Could not replace wood top pieces. Purchased the WM425. It certainally has more fearures, but lacks strength and versality of old model."
3,Everybody Slides Vol.3,"Like its companion volumes ""(Almost) Everybody Slides"" (RCD 10344) and ""Everybody Slides Vol.2"" (RCD 10345), this disc is a collection of slide guitar tracks by a wide variety of guitarists, some tracks recorded especially for this compilation and others pulled from the vaults.Like the previous volumes some tracks work better than others. This is especially true on this 3rd volume, since the selection criteria here seems to be ""exploring the fringes."" There is some free jazz slide guitar, an Indian raga slide guitar, some punkish slide from Curlew guitarist Davey Williams and a fair amount of Fred Frith-like slide ""guitar solos."" I can fully understand why the previous reviewer was baffled.Nevertheless this volume, as do the others, showcases some incredible talent, and buried in amongst the dross are some real gems (including the first return-to-recording of Bill Harkleroad!) For a reasonable price these three discs belong in the collection of every slide aficionado."
5,one of the last great american bands,"signals, calls, and marches is one of the most powerful debuts in music history and the perfect place to start if you're interested in burma. it shows a band that's not quite worn off their influences(wire,gang of four,pere ubu,the stooges), but has most certainly made the best of them. the songwriting(sometimes a weakpoint in this genre)is good as well, which helps to make this listenable for the uninitiated. the only highly abrasive moments are in ""outlaw""(a jerky gang of four-ish stomp)and ""this is not a photograph""(a hyper slide guitar rocker). the cd tacks on ""academy fight song""(possibly their most recognized song with the exception of ""...revolver"")and ""max ernst""(a dedication to the painter and dadaism). this certainly isn't relaxing music(with the possible exception of ""all world cowboy romance"") and it will probably annoy most of your friends(at least your square ones), but it will introduce you to one of the last great american bands."
2,"I'm one of the ""don't get its""","Well I wasn't really around for the early 80's Boston music scene as I was born in 1977, but still, I definitely don't get this album. That's When I Reach For My Revolver is a truly astounding, beautiful song. I'm glad I own it. Academy Fight Song is good but not great. Nothing else on this album is very interesting. What's the big deal? They were avant-garde? They experimented with their sound? Well that's nice, but the end product is mostly boring. With the exception of the stellar opening track, I'm seriously unimpressed."
2,"Had my hopes too high, I guess.","Based on what I'd heard and read about this record, I was expecting something really special. But unfortunately, this comes off as pretty tepid early ""alternative/college rock."" It reminds me of stuff like Gang of Four, the Minutemen, a less abrasive Saccharine Trust etc. In 1981 this might have stood out. Today it just sounds dated. To me, truly classic music doesn't ever sound dated... or at least not to this degree. You can find great music from any period and era that sounds fresh decades later. That doesn't describe this, unfortunately."
4,Super Soft & Cuddly!,"TY Classics ScrumptiousI bought this adorable bear when it was on sale for under $5. Great buy and wish I had purchased more for Christmas gifts. I have a Christmas Bear collection and ""Scrumptious"" is a welcome addition. He's super-soft, well made and very cuddly. Put him on sale again & I'll buy a boat-load!"
4,Trojan TS-27,They are great. They are easy to use and very sturdy. You can make any size sawhorse you want. I really like them.
5,Best horse yet!,"The best saw horse. I have been on a mission for the best horse and have tried about fifteen other types/brands. these take the cake.You can use a 8 ft 2x4 as a top chord and use as a trim paint rack.Full sheet of ply wide or long.Cut throught the 2x4 too much? chuck it put another one, 2x6 whateverScraps from the pile or in the back of the truck? Use for horse...If you hesitate and look at other sawhorses, you're wrong! I like and use both heights for different operations."
4,A nice follow-up to a 5 star album...,"Being a big fan of Dolorean, my expectations were set high for their newest release ""Violence in the Snowy Fields."" 'Violence' proved to be a very nice record, mixing remnants of their previous ""Not Exotic"" with some new sounds. This album overall is more produced and lacks the ""rawness"" that attracted me so much to ""Not Exotic."" Singer/songwriter Al James does continue to do a great job at tugging at the heartstrings of the listener providing us with tracks like ""Dying In Time"" and ""My Grey Life (Second Chances)."" The CD is quite catchy and did grow on me after several listens."
3,Not as good as the last......,"Pretty solid album but not nearly as good as ""Not Exotic"". 'To Destruction' is a pretty good tune but the other 8 tracks are average. Frontman Al James is no doubt a terrific musician but I found it was difficult for me to relate to his lyrics in this one. If this is going to be your first Dolorean purchase, buy ""Not Exotic"" instead."
2,Falsely advertised,"These fans are falsely advertised. They do not bolt right up like stock fans, and the wiring is a custom job too. They are also 1 speed fans, whereas eclipses require 2 speed fans. I'm only giving these a second star because they seem to be of a decent build quality. All in all, however, I feel I was ripped off."
5,Giving life & self a chance,"""The World in the Evening"" is the story of Stephen Monk in the years before and during World War II. After his second marriage implodes, he retreats to his former home, a Quaker town in Pennsylvania, where he is forced to reflect on the whole of his life: his first marriage, his affairs, his inability to emote truthfully. Years ago, Stephen & his first wife travelled to the Canary Islands, where Stephen had an affair with a young man. After that ended in disaster, his first wife died, leaving Stephen confused and adrift. In the Quaker town, with family, and with friends in the form of a gay couple and a German refugee, Stephen confronts himself and ultimately finds inner peace. Isherwood's magnificent novel is as captivating and moving as it is beatifully written. The way the story ends is so full of hope and beauty that it will leave the reader feeling the same as Stephen."
1,don't like it,there's nothing shows how many messages I have. It is just a toy for kids. Not Worth the price
4,male vocal only.,"Lends atmosphere to a reading of Patrick O'Brian's books. But wish the male vocal can be accompanied by period instruments, for the quality of the vocal is not sufficient to stand by itself."
3,Well...,"This is chock full of mostly one page stories that are mildly entertaining and is advertised as such. Really, this is just for the Lansdale completist only. That being said, its better to have it than not."
4,Great pair of speakers for the money!,"I got these to replace the lifeless factory speakers in my Grand Prix. Along with a pair of Sony's up front, they really bring the stock in-dash unit to life. Plenty of treble and even more bass."
1,Not for an Optio,This product is not the Pentax AC adapter for a Pentax Optio 330 or Pentax 430. It is 9 volts. The Optios require 4.5 volts.
1,wrong adapter,"I purchased the item because the description said it was for Pentax digital cameras. Well, it wasn't for my pentax digital camera. So I returned it and was charged the postage for the purchase because it was a special deal and if you return something that had free postage when you return it the postage becomes due. ??? I realized $7.38 after all the deductions were made. Since I based my purchase decision on the description given I believe I should not have been charged the postage."
3,Pleasant music,"This is a nice collection of folk music and poetry drawn from a variety of sources. I bought it as a children's CD, but it is more than that. Most of the time I use CD's for the kids to keep them quiet in the back of the car, and I suffer the noise. This one I can listen to very easily.If I had a criticism I would say that it is not for very small children. Mine are 5, 3 and 1, and they are a little young for it (except for the song about the Bear).Not a record to set the world on fire, but a good middle of the road CD which will suit just about everyone except teenagers."
2,It's a Bit Overrated...,"I ordered this CD based on the glowing customer reviews that were posted a few months ago, and I am sorry to say it did not live up to its reputation. While the best music gets better and better with every new hearing (no small consideration when you have repetition-loving kids), I have found this overlong, overproduced album has instead become more and more irritating. The whole enterprise strikes me as highbrow pretension, from the Shakespearean interludes (nicely played by Ms. Streep but often hard to hear, and with a tenuous thematic connection to the songs) to the pompous spectacle of opera divas singing traditional children's songs. In our house, the classic recordings of Seeger, Guthrie, Leadbelly et. al. are still the favorites; the straightforward, simple, solid recordings of any one of these greats puts the artsy, precious ""Dance on a Moonbeam"" to shame."
2,NOT classic Bill Crofut,"If you really love folk music, you'll love Bill Crofut; but not this album! I grew up listening to Bill Crofut (my parents' old record is all scratched up from me dancing around in front of the record player to the Chipmunk's Day). I love his voice, I love his poetry, I love the way he plays the banjo. I was so excited to see this album now that I have a child myself. But from the moment I turned it on, I loathed it. It's too operatic (I like Opera, but not when I want to listen to folk music), and it makes the very real and down-to-earth songs sound high-faluten and just plin bad. If your're looking for some great music for your kids (even very young ones), get some Bill Crofut music...but get it with Bill singing, not these non-folk singers."
5,GREAT BOOK PURCHASED FROM AMAZON,"Read the introduction by Warran. It has better history than the book that was not written by John Nolan but by a friend of his name- Sylvester Baxter. The long introduction tells you what happened:Nolan was asked to draw up a city plan for Venice Fl. by Dr Albee, who financed it. Nolans staff drew up the plan, because Nolan was busy with other projects. Nolan asked Baxter to write the booK, which he did.The publisher wouldn't PUBLISHit unless Nolan used his name as author and purchased 500 copies in advance. HE DID!AND THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED. ALL THIS FROM THE INTRODUCTION, WHICH NO ONE FROM, VENICE FLA SEEMS TO READ. SO THEY WORSHIP NOLAN AS THE CITY PLANNER AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK"
2,Too difficult to find a phrase,"The phrases in this book work well and the phoenetic spelling isn't horrible, I just found it difficult to quickly find what I wanted to say. I found the two page ""essential phrases"" list in the back of my other travel guides more useful because you didn't have to flip a bunch of pages to get what you need. I was on a brief trip to Europe, this book may be more useful for longer trips."
3,Too Many Things to Too Many People?,"No question that the trio that make up AI are talented (when you get Ray Manzerek's son on keyboard and drums, that ain't bad). But this album shows how tough it is to combine two forms of music together; in this case, rock and electronic. After hearing this album, you can truly appreciate what Smashing Pumpkins or Happy Monday's achieved.Their website describes their music as ""rocktronic"" (ears back), but the first few songs have the genres fighting each other rather than complimenting. Not until they settle well into the best song on the album ""Soul Rescue"" about a third of the way into the album, that they either put the knob-tweaking or the guitars up front. When they let one or the other take the lead, the result is much more solid.Take it as growing pains of a group's debut and trying to please all with their talents. These boys need to settle down and figure out the direction they want to take. Not a bad album, but nothing terribly redeeming."
3,Careful---It's Mostly in German!,"This collection gives a fine overview of Dean Reed's later (1970s-1986) music career. It's even finer, if you happen to speak German, 'cause all the songs, with 4 exceptions, are in German. That's because Dean spent the last 20 years of his life living in East Germany. Still, for those curious to hear the ""Red Elvis"", this is well worth their time."
2,Died after 5 1/2 years,"Paid $2,000 for this 42-inch plasma wide-screen EDTV (One step down from HDTV) back in 2004. Was the best priced 42-inch plasma on the market at the time. It has served us well over 5.5 years, but I would have liked for it to have lasted a little longer. Now, I'm going to buy one five times as good for a third of the price..."
5,WHAT A WAY TO GET HOOKED,"Even though this was actually the third book written in the series, Hollie Van Horne, had such a sense of continuity, she made it the first in the series, having all the details and relationships follow perfectly.Romance writer accidentally falls through a time portal into the 1890's. Finds love and romance. Sets the background for the new Time Travelers Inc. company to be formed, for future time travel. It's a fantasy, but yet could it be real?Hollie Van Horne sure makes you think so. I recommend buying all 6 books, reading them in a row, and continuing with all the new ones to come. The plot premise of the Time Travelers Series, leaves endless options for future books.Become friends with Sam and Jim Cooper, Bruce Wainwright, and all the characters that you will travel with in all the books.the best time travel romance/history/action books I've ever read. And I've read many"
2,A disappointment,"I really expected to like this book...I love time travel romances. Unfortunately, this one was so poor ly done. There were tons of words spelled incorrectly (confidant for confident, being one that annoyed me several times) or used incorrectly (your when she means you're.) This sort of thing gets annoying after there are several in the beginning of a book. The book is told in the first person by what seems to be the author herself. The main character is a novelist who wears a size 6 and a 36DD bra (which seemed like wishful thinking.) She goes back in time and quickly and easily convinces a local that she is from the future...he decides to marry her and buys her a ton of clothes. The clothes shopping seems to go on forever and in great detail. This was when I gave up. This book has an amateur feel to it, as though it were meant to be published in a fanzine. Regretfully I bought the second book to this series as well, as I thought they sounded so good."
2,Where's the Editor????,"I have never been so appalled at misspellings, grammatical errors, and general lack of professionalism in style. I gave it 2 stars because it does have some entertainment value, but not much. These are stick figures, not characters. Don't waste your time or your dime."
4,REVIEW SAWHORSE,WE ARE VERY SATISFIED WITH DESIGN AND QUALITY AND STRENGTH OF CONSTRUCTION.HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCY................FXM
4,Good product,"These are nice, handy, sturdy sawhorses. Although lately ours are usually set up with a number of boards stretched across them, the fact that they can fold for storage is a nice feature. They are lightweight and when not held down by the weight of your project, can blow over in a windy environment. They assembled easily and seem to lock quite securely in place. I think these are a handy addition to a shop and compared to old-fashioned wood horses, conveniently portable for transportation to a job site."
5,makes great tandoori chicken,rajah garam masala helped me make great tandoori chicken. the spices were fresh and fragrant and made a delicious dinner. i would recommend it to others.
3,Heavy on the nutmeg.,"I've used several brands of Garam Masala in my Chicken Tikka Masala recipe, and this one is by far the heaviest on nutmeg. If you're a fan of nutmeg, that's fine, but it does leave a slight aftertaste and it doesn't appeal to me quite as much as others.The smell of the spice mix is nice (again, heavy on nutmeg scent), and the consistency is good. There were no lumps and it did seem fresh enough. Overall, I'd buy it again if I still can't find the stuff I used to buy near my home."
4,Great for it's designed purpose..,"The unibit is fantastic for putting holes in thinner material. A plus is the hole will be deburred on the side you are drilling from. When drilling stainless steel (my experience was with 1/8"" 316 ss) be careful to reduce RPM as each step goes through. It can work harden the material easily, and ruin the bit. A definate ""MUST HAVE"" for working with electrical enclosures and panels as well as sheet metal. Just don't throw away your normal twist drills."
3,Jacobs was overrated,"Arnold Jacobs was a brilliant man who could have succeeded in practically any profession. He was also a fine musical pedagogue, judging from his verbal insights on this CD with respect to the human body as a musical instrument. Yet, I am amazed that he rose to the rank of tubist in a world-class orchestra such as the Chicago Symphony. Frankly, I found his tone quality uninspiring, although he had fine techinque. I have heard at least half a dozen tubists whose tone is far more pleasing musically. Among the bassmen/women of the world, Jacobs has become a semi-divine entity. I believe that he has been somewhat overrated as a result. I felt that his verbal commentaries were highly educational; I was disappointed by his playing overall."
1,Chubby's silent family,"I am chubby's great grand son on the so called dumb farmgirls side. I find it very disrespectful to write a book about a man's history without interviewing or elaborating on the one person who was there. My grandmother could shed more light on the Orange Blossom conspiracy than any one alive. she has shared very vivid and detailed stories about the man and the song. And believe me, she is no dumb farmgirl. She is brilliant and deserves some respect for keeping an entire family together while he turned his back on them."
3,The Untold Story,"I would like to know where the book tells about Chubby's other family living in Georgia and Florida. He had a wife before Rossy and she was no stupid farmgirl. He also had a daughter that loved her father more than anything. Where in the book does it talk about them. It does not say a single word because of one women could not stand to have anything to do with his other family. If women would leave married men alone (this goes both ways), maybe the right family would be in the book. The picture of Chubby's step-grandson is a slap in the face to my husband. He is the bloodline of Chubby Wise. I feel my husband's family deserves a right to tell the unknown years of what really happened and how Rossy became Mrs. Wise. I enjoy knowing Chubby was my husband's grandfather, but on the other hand, I get really upset when I hear how much pain and greif was caused by this piece of history."
5,Bluetooth Revealed review,"Before I bought this book, I looked through the 1070 pages of the Bluetooth specifications and saw the need to write a book about bluetooth, which in a more understandable form describes this very important technology. After I received the book and read through most of it, I do not see the need for another Bluetooth book anymore. Most of the things in there are very well and understandably described without sacrificing the necessary technical details. Thanks, you saved me a lot of time. I also hope you keep it updated, when the next releases of Bluetooth come along. My best regards, Wolfgang Singer"
2,Frustrating,This book has good potential but doesn't follow it's topic clearly at all. I pity the novice trying to make sense of the Bluetooth spec here. There's too much mixing of levels and not nearly enough illustrations and examples. I felt I was presented with a lot of messy information and a very weak understanding of its structure.
3,"Decent overview, but no code examples",Don't expect that you will be writing applications using the Bluetooth's protocol stack right after reading this book. There are no code examples. I was able to write some Bluetooth application but after some intense study of some sample software. I suppose this book is mostly for beginners starting at ground zero who want to get started on understanding how Bluetooth works. I also wished it talked more about the differences between Bluetooth and 802.11 like it did for IrDA
1,Poorly Written Book,Book is boring and dry. The book does not educate but a mere and dry presentation of facts taken from Bluetooth specifications. It is a disappointment - the cover looks great but the content is a no.
1,Major Disappointment,"After all the hype and the previous reviews of this book, I have to confess that I've found it to be a major disappointment. Much is made of the authors' having contributed to version 1.0B of the Bluetooth spec...Well, I suppose that if you helped author the specification this confusing melange of propaganda, explanations, and wishful thinking is the book for you. For the rest of us, the larger members of the SIG do provide some detailed Bluetooth explication on their respective corporate sites."
1,Don't waste your time or money,I hope you do your research before buying this book. I found it to be a major disapointment. There are better books out there that cover this topic.
3,Enjoyable & Funny,"Nothing too over the top, but a nicely paced flick with good humor. It's on par with the show ""Workaholics"" and benefits from good casting. It seems that the director or the producers were playing it safe with the storyline, and not getting too outrageous, but the film makes a good Sunday evening rental."
4,A number of musical styles put together in perfect harmony,"Williams uses his musical gift and ability to catch the atmosphere of jazz, pop and classical music in a truely artistic way. The musical form being that of the variation uses a theme of french reconaissance and turns it into a perfectly synthesised ""era"" music, each reflecting its own genre. It should more be considered a work of its own, standing aside from most soundtracks by being completely free from theatrical and cheap imitations. This music is the work of true inspiration and ingenuity, by a craftsman who have accomplished above expectations and contributed to making filmscores an art of its own."
5,It's great!,"What brought my attention to this soundtrack was Amazon's ""Essential Recording"" status. I liked what I heard in the sound clips, so I purchased it... And I'm so glad I did!The album contains a handful of different arrangements of the ""Main Title"" theme (aka ""Theme from the Eiger Sanction""), all of which are quite enjoyable, along with the other music composed for the film. The CD has a mix of music ranging from jazz to classical... even with some of that '70s twang.A great listen for all film music fans!"
2,AIN'T WHAT THEY USED TO BE,"I have been a loyal Milwaukee cordless user for many years now, so loyal that I could have been a salesman for their products. A friend bought a 1/2"" Makita 14 volt kit and well I was blown away. It has just about as much power as my 18volt and it's lighter and the batteries are far superior. I guess this is why I am writing this review. Milwaukee has gone on and created their 24volt system with a much better battery and just forgotten us 18volt guys and left us with these crappy batteries. The original batteries seemed to be top of the line and now ther're junk. Still cost a lot though. I must have 10 of them in my shop most of which really need to go to the recycler. My suggestion is if your just starting out and want 18volts avoid the Milwaukee as sooner or later you are going to be disappointed."
1,Awful customer service,"After a few of my Milwaukee batteries would no longer hold a charge (after less than 6 months), I sent them back to the service center. They sent me the batteries back and said that they had tested OK. They won't even take a charge. Buy anything but Milwaukee cordless tools. Even Ryobi and Ridgid have better batteries than these."
3,tools rock batteries suck,"batteries are POS quality. Im running 6 bateries on my tools and its been a touch over a year and they are dead. on one small job i cna go thru all 6 just on the drill alone, its ridiculous."
2,Keeping the faith,"I too own a Milwaukee bag of tricks. I did buy it second hand. However, I do know why the set was sold. The batteries are the sets downfall. Ironically, I was born, raised, and still live in Milwaukee. Over 30 years in the trades, I still believe in the Milwaukee name, U.S.A. To my Milwaukee and U.S.A. designers, builders, engineers and craftsmen, Let us severe the umbilical ties with outside sources and build American products for our, American brothers and sisters, daily uses. Let us no longer allow ourselves to come up short when it comes to providing quality for our own. Let us set our sights within ourselves. Let us build the best. They will come. I will pay top dollar for an American product. If, however, an American family reaps those benefits.Milwaukee Tool, bring your products back into the hands of your American Builders. I will probably sell my kit to a foreigner. Just kidding. Maybe I will melt it into a sculpture.....????"
3,"geniune Milwaukee, but old technology","These were decent batteries 6 or 7 years ago when there were no alternatives but we go through one these things every month it seems. They're just not built to last for heavy duty contractor work. These are actually an improvement over the original Milwaukee 18 V batteries and I think at the time their service center replaced those for free, but unless you have a lot of tools like we do (we have about 4 combo bags and a couple of drills), you might want to consider the new lithium ion tools."
4,Great service,We bought a two pack and one would not hold a charge after 18 months. They sent a fedex prepaid label. They sent a brand new one in a reasonable amount of time. My SO loves their products and has had very good preformance from them.
2,Yet another negative review,"I have nothing new to add, these batteries suck and die within a matter of a few months! I'm a moderate user of my milwaukee 18v drill, and the cost to keep operating it only in the price of batteries is out of control!"
2,Batteries have a short life,"I've been unhappy with the lifespan of the 18v Milwaukee batteries. Compared to my Makita batteries, the Milwaukees last only half as long or less, before they won't take a charge anymore.Too bad, because I really like the 18v Milwaukee circular saw and the 18v Hatchet recip saw. Rather than purchase new batteries from Milwaukee, I'm going to try having the old ones rebuilt and see if that improves their performance."
1,4 batteries dead in 8 months...4!,"Though I did not buy brand new 18v Milwaukee batteries from Amazon (yet) more customers need to be aware their Ni-Cad 18v series has major issues. I bought a multipiece kit, impact wrench, and one extra battery. Not 10 months later, ALL batteried began losing charge in a matter of days to the point the charger would not recharge them they were so dead. No other brand of Ni-Cad's have done this. NOT ONE. And I have 3 other brands, and one generic American Gardner 18v bush trimmer battery.Milwaukee 18v batteries are complete junk, and not worth a dime.Look for their 18v lithium series though. Since I have their tools aready, I dont have much choice but to pay (what I'm sure to be) an insanly high price for one."
1,Milwaukee's worst,"I have purchased many contractor grade tools in the past 10 years. Without a doubt, these batteries (all 6!) are the worst purchases I have made. My 18-volt drill runs great, if only I did not have to blow $80 on a new battery every 4 months. I give up... I am going with Makita. No complaints from my friends on the job site with Makita drills and impact drivers."
2,18 volt battery,I have two batteries and after a little over 1 year they both went dead!! I only use for home work and am disappointed that they do not last longer!! Otherwise the tools are excellent equipment.
1,I have to finally admit...Milwaukee batteries DO suck,"Well, maybe it was pride. Or the fact that ALL of my other Milwaukee tools are solid & dependable. I really do go out of my way (and will spend more $) to buy a Milwaukee tool over most others. Makita & Bosch also get my business.BUT, MILWAUKEE BATTERIES SUCK SUCK SUCK. If that is a professional term ;)I have finally had it, and will be selling all of my used Milwaukee cordless tools. The actual quality of the cordless tools (18v) is superb. It's just that the batteries die FAR too fast. And at $80+ each...I just will not go on anymore. If the batteries were $25 bucks each, I'd definitely keep the Milwaukee gear. Personally, I think that ALL cordless tools are far too expensive in the long run. But, you just can't live without them. The technology is old enough, when will the prices drop just like digi cameras & computers???Save your money & your sanity.....DO NOT BUY MILWAUKEE 18v BATTERIES! (unless you can find them as dirt cheap throw aways)"
1,MILWAUKEE BATTERIES SUCK!!!,"I HAVE 7 MILWAUKEE 18V POWER TOOLS. I HAVE GONE THROUGH 12 OR MORE BATTERIES. THEIR BATTERIES SUCK! THE TOOLS WON'T WEAR OUT, BUT THE BATTERIES WILL NOT LAST. IN A NORMAL DAY I WILL USE 5-6 BATTERIES COMPARED TO 2 DEWALTS ON THE SAME TYPE TOOL. I'M SELLING THE MILWAUKEES AND CHANGING TO DEWALT."
1,NOT EVEN WORTH ONE STAR,"I have always sworn by Milwaukee - up until I have owned their eqiuipment for little over a year.THESE BATTERIES SUCK! I mean that literally, they suck the juice right out of themselves.I have many Milwaukee tools, and have two chargers - two of three batteries died in a year - Milwaukee corded tools are excellent - but for now I stay with B&D; and Craftsman!After contacting Milwaukee they explained how I should jump-start the batteries. It worked on one, not on the other. After a day or so the one that was jumped cease to work. Milwaukee has covered their rears with legal documentaion so is you cannot dispute or return for an exchange. They obviously know what an inferior product they have!Take heed to this warning, as well as others here - SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SANITY!"
3,Good Price - Marginal Product,"As anyone who reads the reviews knows, the batteries last a pitifully short time. BUT, the good news, Amazon has them for what they are worth. Cheap!"
1,"Great tools, bad batteries",I purchased the 18v combokit about 3 years ago. The tools themselves are fantastic but the batteries are terrible. With in a year both batteries were dead. Now that number six has quit i am going to buy another kit from Dewalt or Makita beacuse replacing batteries every year is just unacceptable and expensive!
3,"hit or miss ,","the quality of these things seems terribly variable . i have too many old style tools to change and too many batteries and chargers as well . the trick is to use a battery rebuilding service , find one online , send in your old batteries to be rebuilt for a fraction of the price ."
2,LACKING IN PZZAZZ,"NOT A REAL GOOD COMMERCIAL BATTERY. ABOUT A YEARS WORTH OF MEDIUM HEAVY USE. KIND OF AN EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT, BUT THE MILWAUKEE TOOLS ARE GREAT. HOW DID WE EVER GET ALONG?"
1,One of the two died,"I had two of these, both look like new as I lightly use them. One died. The other still working. Manufacturer's defect is the only reason I can think of."
3,Steady performers,"These batteries are steady performers and help to give my 18 Volt tools ""second-life"" after the factory original batteries wore out."
3,Reviving your dead batteries,"Yes these batteries die quick because they drain too low for the battery charger to charge them. There are 3 things you can do to revive them. Stick a 9 volt battery to them for 30 seconds, positive is single lead then put it on the charger, set battery in the sun till it gets very hot to the touch then put it on the charger, and last put it in the oven at 300 degrees for 5 minutes and then put it on the charger. Also don't leave the battery on the charger after the light has gone out, this causes them to go bad faster. I have six batteries and have had them for over 4 years and I have kept them alive by using all three methods."
2,Batteries are terrible,"While I like the Milwaukee product I detest these batteries. If you use them daily, like I do, you are are lucky to get 6 months out of them. I am constantly ordering new batteries becuase they simply stop charging between 5-7 mos after purchase. I have a Ryobi that I used daily before these for 6 mos and It is now 2 years old and still has the same battery. Had I known the battery stank I would not have purchased the set."
1,bad battery,"I have also had the same problem and it just irks me that I got 2 with the tools set and a free battery, I was only able to charge the free one 2 or 3 times!Granted I don't use them on a daily basis but it was a new battery and now the other 2 are shot! These cost aound $80-120 on line and $60 each at HD or Lowes!At that price I can get Ridged tools set for about the price of 2 batterys!"
1,Milwaukee 18 volt Batteries,I hadmore service life out of less expensive tools. The milwauke batteries are short lived and haved turned me to look at other brand battery operated tools.
1,No improvement,"I had hoped that Milwaukee would work on this problem. However the two batteries I purchaced most recently lasted about 5 months each. I guess they just want us to buy new tools. When I do, they will not be Milwakee tools."
3,V18 Li-Ion A Better Deal,At current prices you can get the superior Li-Ion V18 batteries and a new charger for about $20 more than this pair. Upgrading is the way to go at that price. The new charger will charge Li-Ion and any old Ni-Cad 18 volt Milwaukee batteries you still have.
5,durable,Tough and long lasting. I cut 6 pieces of 3/4 in. plywood in half the long way and still had alot of juice left. With my drill I built a 4' x 8' three step deck on one charge. professional quality.
2,There's a Secret for These Batteries!,OK. I'm the first to admit. These batteries are not good. They lose a charge and become useless inside of a year (maybe two). But I think the problem isn't the batteries themselves. It's the charger. Save yourself LOTS of money and buy the Milwaukee 48-59-0260 Multi-Bay Battery Charger. Amazon sells for CHEAP and they completey recondition the old useless batteries. It's amazing how well it works.
1,"great tools, Horrible batteries","I have both a 18 V hammer drill and a sawsall.I think the tool construction is great, and when they had new batteries, they ran great. Problem is, for an occasional user, the batteries die very quickly, and cannot be recharged.My nephew uses his tools on a daily basis, and has less problems, but he still runs through batteries very quickly. If you are just an occasional user, I cannot recommend these tools. Maybe the new Lith ion V18 batteries will be better.Lets hope."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought the Milwaukee Hatchet recprocating saw a few years ago along with (2) new 18 Volt Milwaukee batteries, From the very beginning I was very turned-off with the rediculously short work-time I got with this tool. Soon after, I stopped using it altogether. I recently tried the tool again. Of course by this time the batteries would not even light up the indicator on the charger. A service tech at Milwaukee told me how to ""jump-start"" the batteries so that they could recharge. Well he was right about the ""jump-start"" in that it caused the charger indicator to light up. But after following his advice to the letter, surprise, surprise. Maybe 30 secs of operation. In conclusion, hope that one day Milwaukee makes a half-decent battery that might actually allow your Hatchet to work off its debt to you."
1,"'Tis true, Milwaukee batteries suck","I bought a Milwaukee cordless hammer drill set, and within 6 months one of the batteries started loosing charge rather quickly. 6 months later the remaining battery crapped out. Yeah, these batteries are bad, guys. The unit works great, they just need to work on the batteries."
1,Don't get me started on Milwaukee batteries...,"I was just browsing for tools when I came across this so called ""value pack"" of Milwaukee batteries. Just seeing the picture of the batteries raised by blood pressure several points. Yes, they will die on you, and sooner rather than later, leaving a wonderful drill useless. At least they've lowered the price on them to a point that is CLOSER to their true value... I suppose to appease those of us who must continue to purchase them.When I bought the drill I couldn't believe these batteries were as bad as people were saying, but now I'm a believer..."
1,Bad deal for me,"I ordered this same cash register and it also did not come with a scanner. I called customer care in India and got a man with horrible English skill. Who said "" No scanner No scanner!"" very rude and nasty like. The next day I got onto an online chat with someone named Pureen (sp) Who told me the only way to solve this matter was to buy another unit and send the defective unit back . Thus charging my cc twice which I refused to do. I asked her for a case # twice for the chat log and she refused to give it to me. She said the log would remain and all was safe. Very poor service indeed. The next day I got an e mail from Amazon India who wanted to know what the problem was because there was no chat log and I have yet to hear a thingAll I want is a working cash register for my company. But now this. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon for myself family and employees. But will really think again before I order anything. Please make me whole again"
5,Royal Cash Register,"The Royal Cash Register we bought actually ended up getting upgraded. The company it shipped from did not include the barcode scanner, but as soon as I called they shipped one out and it was handled very well. We actually use this cash register for our children to play with and they love it and it works great."
4,mob...the best,"mission of burma were simply the best band in boston from 1978-1981...as i remember...vs. is a classic example of their work and attests their recogition as on of the best bands of the ""new wave ""era""...the band rocked with an edge unparalled by any...this cd captures mission of burma at their finest with knockout performances of their best songs...vs is a great cd..."
5,Brilliant Thrash of Energy,"There was a genius in this band (Roger Miller) and they did reach a peak here. Aggressive guitar-driven punk never got more ambitious than this; they play with intelligence, but as if their lives depended on it. ""Fun World"" is brilliant throbbing metal/noise. ""Einstein's Day"" is a brilliant composition played at a slow boiling grind. ""Mica"" is the ultimate pogo music. On this album (their only major acheivement) Burma take their noise/art aesthetic to its maximum length and sit down at the table with peers from their era like Wire, the Minutemen, and Pere Ubu."
4,Better than expected,"I was pleasantly surprised at how good this album was. Every song has its own hook, its own sound. Not all songs are fast and hard (although the ones that are, are good). Good melodies and impassioned singing. One of the best albums of the early '80s."
5,Sawhorse,"These are great! They break down easy for storage or transporting them. You can make them as wide as you want to. We put a 12 foot long 2x6 in them to use for panting metal parts. Then we took them apart and put a 36"" long 2x6 in and we use them all over the place. I think we must have 15 pair of them."
5,"trojan 35"" sawhorse","These sawhorse legs are great. You can use any 2x material with it (although they might become less sturdy the taller you made them). And also you can make them a variety of lengths. They are easily collapsible and very sturdy. They are a little expensive but worth it. Just know that when you purchase one unit, it is only two sets of legs to make one sawhorse."
4,Rugged and convenient if a little pricey,"Bought these kind of on a whim but havent been sorry. Set up and take down is simple and quick once you get use to it and I like being able to use any length 2x I need. Only complaints are the price and if you dont use a perfectly straight 2x they wobble a little, otherwise a highly reccomended addition to any builders truck."
5,"Excellent sawhorses....simple design, incredible strength","These sawhorses can hold an incredible amount of weight. They create a very stable work surface for cutting, and the width can be changed quickly by replacing your 2x4 with a shorter or longer one depending on your needs. They set up and break down very easily too. However, use caution while setting these up, keeping your hands and fingers away from pinch points. Lifetime warranty....can't do too much better than that. Highly recommend these to anyone looking for the best sawhorses available."
5,Strong horses,"Third pair of horses. Now have a pair on each of my trucks. They are worth the money, never by another set of horses again. Like the 35"" legs because Iam 6'8"" and all my guys are tall."
1,Read product description,"my dissatisfaction with this item is my fault more than anything. I assumed (rather than reading the product description) that they were standard 3X5 flashcards -- they are not. They are about the size of a business card. They are also very, very thin."
4,Useful for Many Purposes,"I've mostly experienced using these flash cards for language training. While you can buy pre-printed language cards, the blank cards always proved more versatile and allowed me to focus on the vocabulary lists that my teachers provided. These cards are smaller than index cards, which is good for vocabulary training where you only have a word or two on each side."
3,Vis Ed vocab cards,"The printed French, German, Italian vocab cards are great for jogging your memory but are set at an intermediate level so I had to start making my own advanced level personalized vocab. I bought my first set of blanks from Amazon UK, under 10 including postage. Then I wanted more but had to get them from Amazon in the US where the cards are made. More expensive to have sent of course. I've bought three boxes of blanks now and although Vis Ed do say 'an average of' 1000 cards in every box, they do shortchange you a bit; typically 40-50 short. On the other hand you'll probably mess up more than that writing them out yourself. Its frustrating that they are so cheap to buy in the States (6$) and there's no equivalent anywhere else in Europe."
5,Book about love and relationships,"I hoped this would be a good book because I love the Chicken Soup books for teens, and it is. I couldn't beleive that every single question I could think of was answered AND the answers were good. I loved the section on friends because I am in love with my best friend and I haven't been able to tell him. Now I think I am going to. The reason is because I now know that even if he doesn't feel the same way about me it doesn't mean that I was wrong to tell him. This book really gives you courage to be honest about your feelings and I think teens really need this. The last relationship I was in ended because my boyfriend hated the way everyonetalked about us like we were a television show or something.I think all teens should read this book, girls and guys because it has good ideas about how to handle every situation. The poetry and the stories are great,too, which is like an extra bonus."
3,Not the best book around - check out Chicken Soup,"Teen Love: On Relationships certainly did not live up to my expectations! I found there to be unnecessary, boring inserts fro the author and her daughter that only helped me to put the book down and often cancelled out the effects of the few great stories that are in there.Most of the stories in this book are either immature or cliched and if I had to recommend this book to someone, it will be to those people aged 14 and under. For those people with more life experience, you may find the majority of these stories to be unoriginal and not worth the time it takes to read them.If you are looking for a great book along similar lines, I would suggest Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul - Love & Friendship, or any other book in the Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul series."
4,"The beginning was great, but...","I first sampled this book on my kindle. I thought It was one of the best relationship books i've ever read! But then after I bought it, it just became a book with a bunch of personal stories in it. It didn't really teach me anything after about the first 30 pages."
1,it was a waste of money,"I bought this book in hopes it would be as good as the chicken soup books, it wasn't! This book gave 2nd grade advice on relationships. It was a waste of money. Stick with the chicken soup for the soul books, if you want stories and not the advice of the author."
4,Thoughtful play loud drink whiskey with lights low,"A varied and interesting program, although ""Crooked Frame"" is a better song to play when you're pissed off at 2am than ""Pissed Off 2am."" A songwriter who doesn't get cute for the sake of cuteness or lean heavily on the ever-growing choss pile that is alt-country-Austin cliche, Escovedo knows what he's doing. What I play when I'm driving across Wyoming."
5,my favourite escovedo album,Just a great album. I have now listened to several of his albums and this one is my favourite. This packaging is a particularly good bargain since you get a second disc with Al in intimate live settings.
2,much preaching,"The basic story line is good but I felt like I was reading a book of sermons. All of the preaching did become boring. A revised version featuring some basic Christian principles without all the sermonizing would be much better. One of the romance angles was ridiculous. Do a young woman and man jump into each other's arms every time they see each other and gaze adoringly at each other if it is not romantic love? On a positive note, the descriptions of life along the trail were excellent."
5,Wonderful,"This has got to be one of the best stories I have ever read. I loved Eternal Passage but this book is even better. I felt like I was seeing and experiencing everything along with the the main character Abby on that wagon train, and each step of the Talbot family journey was interesting and compelling and kept me turning pages. The scenic details and characterizations were splendidly done. I actually regretted seeing the story come to an end."
5,Exceptional!,"One of the finest examples of raw songwriting using just guitar, bass drum and a haunting voice."
2,Edith Baines Bunker,"I have always found the MUSIC of Galaxie 500 to be enjoyable...I just could never get over lead vocals that sound like Edith Bunker from ""All In The Family"". I'm just saying..."
2,Boring distorted tenderness,"Could be heard as pretty, but comes across as pretty dumbed-down instead. The playing, songwriting, singing, etc. all feel rather amateurish even if their hearts may be somewhere around right place (which is probably why the band got many people to enjoy these compositions)."
3,Why so hyped?,"If I could choose any Galaxie 500 album to buy, it'd be this one. Having said that, there are only 3 songs on here that I enjoy listening to, and two of them are covers (""Strange"", the Twinkies song; ""Ceremony""; ""What A Pity""). The rest feel unfocussed and wonky, much like the tunes on other albums. I think you'd be better off listening to a friend's copy and spending your money on something else (Pylon comes to mind, as do the first two Lilys albums)."
2,Gimme a break...,"There are exactly one and one-half excellent songs on here, and even when the music is finally on, the lyrics are so trite it nearly completely ruins the moment. For heaven's sakes, the best song on here sings about Twinkies, you guys. Come on!!! I don't know what all the fives are all about in the other reviews here, but it bugs me. These people live in a different universe than myself.Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad CD. It's not terrible. It's OK, in fact. But I was sucked into blowing fifteen dollars on it via the same blowhard unfathomable propaganda that appears in these other reviews here: Yep, one time I read in some or other indie music magazine that was raving about the old ""Galaxie 500""; and, for goodness sake, to this day, I am baffled. For this was not a great group, folks. Not by a long shot. They weren't bad, but they weren't good either. Gimme a break."
5,One of my favorite recordings,I love this album. It's like walking across the street with a friend; a show of appreciation for the everyday workings of this ordinary world. The singer grows on you (he sounds off-key at first) and the lyrics are wonderfully casual--i.e. in one song he sings about eating his twinkie while waiting in line at a store. All of the songs are suffused with an incredible sadness that is beautiful and uplifting at the same time.
3,Night Music by Charlotte Lamb (Large Print),"Description from the book back cover:""I bought you, and what I buy stays bought, even if it proves to be worthless,"" Steve Crawford had told Lisa. Was it any use her going on trying to convince him that all his ideas about her were wrong? Her relationship with Denny was purely platonic and now Steve was being equally blind about her friendship with Jon. But Lisa was still strangely drawn to Steve even knowing he didn't love her. Why didn't he just finish with her and have done with it?"
1,most disappointing,"given the quality of other monographs by this publisher, the beauty of HCB's landscapes etc., and especially the price of this book, one has every right to expect something special. Sadly this book is far from special. Each illustration has a thick black surround which, frankly makes it impossible to concentrate on, and enjoy the image content. The quality of reproduction is average, somewhat lacking the sparkle of other monographs. Still worse are the vast acreages of blank white pages. What is going on here ??, the number of images could have been doubled and more, quite easily. Information on location, and context are frustratingly sparse - I do not know if HCB did keep a log of his locations, but it would be nice to have rather more than, say, ""Japan"". This rich and fascinating area of HCB's work deserves a proper presentation, rather than just something that seems to have been 'cobbled together', as this has."
4,Gem from the Great White North,"I stumbled across this show one day when I was browsing through (that website where you can legally watch shows for free) looking for something new to watch. I'm not sure what compelled me to mouse over the decidedly soapy looking image, but I did. When I read the description, it was the mention of time travel that piqued my interest, if just a little. I watched the first episode, and I was hooked. Not a show most dudes might admit to watching, but hey, good drama is good drama. It's well-written, well-acted, and very entertaining. I can't wait for season 3 to find out more about what it's like to Be Erica."
1,Awful title and presentantion,"Being Erica: Season OneI don't know if the seller knew this before, but the second disc of the first season is wrong, it really contains the chapters included in the second disc of the second season. At least in the boxset I received, but I think it is the same case for all the first season series, because the disc is printed with the first season graphics.If you are planning to buy this first season series, don't do it, they are very expensive for a poor presentation and this kind of manufacture errors.I also bought the second season, it has no errors.By the way, I contacted Netdealz (the seller) and they offered me to return it. I ended up downloading the chapters from a blog (with Portuguese subtitles). It would be more expensive to return it from Mexico. As a suggestion, Amazon should offer you download them for free."
5,"The best show ever made, and it'll make you better too!!","The best show ever made, and it'll make you better too!! Seriously, this is funniest and most dramatic show, but it also has really cool life lessons that'll make your own life better and better. Who knew personal development could be as easy as enjoying a great tv show. Why aren't people like Tony Robbins, Wayne Dyer, Depak Chopra, Brian Tracy, T. Harv Eker, Rhonda Byrne, Ekhardt Tolle, Oprah Winfrey and Dr Phil telling everyone to buy DVD of this show? They should!"
4,You Can't Relive Your Life Exactly,"Having a bad day at work, Dr Tom decides to give Erica a break from his hard therapy session and take her back to a time where she was happy. Erica misses her brother, Leo, very much and the last time she was with Leo was when he was at an amusement park along with her sister. This was the last time she saw Leo before he died. She learned that you can't relive the same experience twice. Each time you relive it, it changes a little.I find this episode ok. I like the scene where Leo has a crush with an older girl and seduces her. I also like the scene where Erica apologizes to her sister at a fountain and splashes water at her."
5,Challenged by the Sheikh,"This book is one that won't let you put it down. The story is fast paced, warm, funny and very tantalizing (think first date chills all from the comfort of your couch).The hero and heroine, both battling past demons learn to overcome their fears, open their hearts and look forward. Set outside of Savannah on a horse farm, Kristi weaves a tale of an investment banker learning to ride inorder to advance her career. The sheik, who's sibling appeared in previous Kristi Gold Books, is attracted to her, and sets his sights on obtaining her, without the complication of settling down. They both find that they are lost, and ultimately make the step toward happily ever after. The secondary characters add spriit and humor, and the sex....well... you'll have to read it for yourself..."
5,A SEQUEL TO BE CHERISHED,"That Ms.Drinkwater's 'The Olive Farm' made me immediately want to pack and fly to see the verdant countryside she described, I never believed for a moment that a sequel could be so much more engrossing and personal.'The Olive Season' is filled with the stories of visitors to the farm, together with the difficulties of bringing the olives to fruit, but it is her baring her soul in dealing with the trauma of a personal tragedy that tears ones heart out. She must be a fighter for she went on with her life and her farm, and in the end one knows she will come out on top. A joy to read and to re-read."
2,Trivia and Facts but no restoration tips or photos,"While Mr. Cropsey's book is full of factual information and trivia of the beloved air cooled VW car, it is essentially a rehash of previous publications. I might recommend Ray Miller's 'Volkswagen Bug: The People's Car,' or Terry Shuler's 'Volkswagen, Then, Now, and Forever.' Mr Miller's book is full of photos depicting model year changes and factual information. Terry Shuler's book is written similarly, and is an invaluable asset to the VW hobbyist. Mr. Shuler was instrumental in the founding of the Vintage Volkswagen Club of America and has many vintage restorations to his credit. Having driven air cooled Volkswagen cars for over 42 years, and having owned 7 vintage Volkswagens during this time, I'd suggest you save your money and invest in the latter mentioned publications. I do not claim to be an expert or scholar on Volkswagen restoration, though I do have many years and time invested in 'wrenching' on these cars and participation in the hobby."
5,Hilarious,"I honestly couldn't stop laughing. The awkward situations that Jessica manages to get herself into are amazing! Jordan is fun and totally believable. Once again, Janette Rallison has perfectly captured teenage personalities with the perfect amount of wit, humor, and romance."
5,Excellent. Clear and Very Well Written.,This book is one of the clearest and well written introductions to the subject I've read. I recommend it hands down over Griffiths or Cohen-Tannoudji. My only gripe is that it needs more problems (and solutions too) at the end of each chapter.
3,Not bad...,"An avarage introduction to QM. Some aspects of the organization are imaginative, but on the whole the book does not convey the beauty of QM adequately. The book contains the necessary reference material for a decent undergraduate course, but anyone looking for depth and insight must look elsewhere."
3,Too advanced,"If your looking for a book to really explain and work out the problems, this book is not for you. Also, a lot of the problems in this book are very advanced for what the test really consist of. If your taking a exam with New York, or some California departments, this book will probably serve you well. However for the rest of us, this book will simply be too advanced for the real problems your going to encounter. The Math section in this book does a good job of letting you know what you need to study, but again, the explanations simply suck, and are very hard to follow.I suggest you try, Smoke Your Firefighter Written Exam. This book really explains in detail every problem and how to solve them by taking baby steps. Really a good book.Keep in mind that almost all of these books are going to consist of the same material. The difference is how the problems are explained. I suggest you buy at least 2 books to study which should give you a good medium somewhere in between."
3,it was a good book,Book was good but didn't help me much for the test it doesn't have much info on the stuff you need to know for firefighter 1 & 2 test
4,Well Written,I got this book based on a friends recommendation. So far it has been easy to work with. I hope to take the exam in the beginning of January so we shall see what the results are. The book is very well written.
2,Not good quality,"I was surprised at the quality of this product after reading the reviews. I was expecting this to be more durable than it actually was. It is already coming apart. I guess the important part is that my daughter seemed to initially like it. I knew I'd been had when I saw the box it came in. They are worth half of whatever the going price is. For the money spent, I'd spring for the few $$ extra and go with a higher end or more trusted name brand for doll accessories."
4,Grand-daughter liked it,"This was a gift, along with a doll, for a 2-year old.It was the right size/weight, for her, and she immediately loved it.The seller did a good job as well, with quality, timeliness, and met expectations."
3,She likes her dolls now!,I bought this for my [...] old Granddaughter. She now loves her dolls as she can put them to bed.The only DRAWBACK to this item is that the handles do not velcro together. It would make it much easier for toddlers to carry around.Reckon I will sew some velcro on myself.
3,Small but nice,This is perfect for a small doll. We ordered the baby Annabelle and had to cram it in. This is nice but small
1,Not For Serious Sign Language Students,"Perhaps you're looking at this title because you see the words ""sign language starter"" and you are wanting to start learning sign language. Well, please do not let that shape your opinion on the use of this book!If you are truly interested in learning to sign with other members of the adult Deaf community, you do NOT want to learn Signed ENGLISH. That is something only used by deaf children in school to teach them the English language. However, once grown, a deaf person changes over to ASL or Pidgin Sign English (NOT the same as Signed English).If you want to communicate with deaf children, this book is sure to be useful. However, if your'e seriously interested in REAL sign, please step to the other side of the aisle and pass quickly. Just this deafie's opinion! :o("
3,Useful but outdated,"Most signs were correct, but there are lots of variations, and this book only shows one way to do them. Also, hard to follow the pictures sometimes (along with the descriptions)."
2,"I wanted to like ""DSKIP""","Really, I did want to like this album. I was a fan of AudioVENT since the day's of their indie release ""Papa's Dojo"" and when they got signed I was glad to see another one of my favorite SoCal acts get to experience their dream and tour so I could finally see them here on the East Coast. But it took these guys forever to get this album out, and sometimes albums are worth the wait. But after about two years passed ""DSKIP"" finally came out, only, much to my disappointment, there were only 4 new songs, 1 old song with brand new lyrics, and 7 songs that remained almost completely unchanged from their independant release in 1999. To me that shows a serious lack of creativity on their part. The four new songs they do have on the album are very good, I just wish that there was more new material to listen to. Hopefully with the next album they'll fix that."
4,Pretty good!,"I'm not the biggest rock fan, but I always can appreciate some good music. Well, along comes Audiovent. I heard this song while playing Madden 2003 on my Playstation 2 and I was like man... This song(The Energy) is really good, so I ended up getting the CD to see if this song's quality could've been matched by any of the other songs on the CD. Well, I don't think any of them topped the song, but quite a few of them sure came close. This group sure has quality as a primary focus. With other songs such as ""I can't breathe"", ""Rain"" and ""Beautiful addiction"", this CD is definitely worth picking up. A lot of times it is hard to spot artists such as Audiovent amongst all of the ""angry"" rock music that I hear, but I'm definitely glad that I had a chance to catch this!"
5,"Great music, Great energy, Great guys","I got their indie album ""Papa's Dojo"" (when they were still called Vent) and I loved it. I couldn't wait for their next album to come out. While waiting and waiting for this new CD I came across these guys and started talking to them. They are really cool guys. I stay in contact with them and I talk to them about music all the time. When you hear them talk about what music is to them, their influences, and why they love doing this, you can hear the passion. When you play their songs, or see them play, you can feel the passion. As long as their our bands like Audiovent, I do not worry about the future of good pure rock music."
5,AUDIOVENT ROCKS!,"I just got Audiovent's CD and it rocks! All of the tracks on ""Dirty, Sexy Knights in Paris"" are great. Right from the start the CD is jammin' with ""The Energy"", ""Looking Down"", and ""Rain"". Then it mellows down with the track ""Sweet Frustration"", and then back up again with ""Stalker"" and Gravity"". I really like the final track ""When I Drown"". It is very unique and dramatic. All around this is an awsome CD!"
5,Audiovent,"The CD by Audiovent, ""Dirty Sexy Knights in Paris"" is the best CD I have heard in a LONG time. I really like the songs ""The Energy"", and ""Looking Down"". The song, ""Looking Down"", is about how the band doesn't need their famous brothers to help them to be succesful in the music business. And that they'll make it. To me, they will make it with this CD! It is the best and people should go out and buy the CD! (And I'm not 12, I'm actually turning 14. I only used the kids review because I don't have a password to write a review on the adult part!)"
2,Who produced this? Fire THEM!,"The music isnt anything special although their are some gems that are worth listening to over and over (Gravity, Underwater Silence, Looking Down). But the sound quality of the album is absolutely horrible, i think the record company owes the band and all their fans an apology."
2,"Not a bad start, but they need work","The only tracks worth listening to are Looking Down, Rain & I Can't Breathe. Besides that every other track is just...blah.And what on earth is up with the lryic, ""I am the hell that saved you."" from the track Beautiful Addiction? That's messed up. He also says, ""to me, & try on my clothes"" in Stalker. Weird stuff."
4,Great sophomore album....,"I started listening to this band back when they were Vent, and their first release, 'Papa's Dojo,' could only be ordered through the band's website. A good first album, but boy, have they come a long way!! Pick this one up, and a copy of 'Papa's Dojo' if you can find it...."
5,"All I Have To Say Is ""WOW!""","Audiovent's ""Dirty Sexy Knights In Paris"" should be bought if you are debating whether you should or not. The answer should be YES. THIS BAND WILL BE AROUND FOR A WHILE!"
3,Audiovent - Dirty Sexy Knights In Paris,"I don't think its fair to keep comparing this band to Incubus just because of the ""relations"". However after listening to this album you just can't help it! You can hear the similarities of Jason's voice with Brandon's. This album has the same laidback attitude that 'Morning View' has and some songs from this album would have fitted in 'Morning View' perfectly.This is a good debut album. For me the standout tracks are 'Looking Down', 'Rain', and 'Beautiful Addiction'. This isn't totally original stuff but in its own way it sounds fresh and is worth a listen."
2,inaccurate information,"Margaret Visser's advice has been quoted on Sage Asian Advice on Soup Etiquette, and the advice looks to me entirely misleading. It reads: ""A Chinese banquet often begins with fruit and ends with soup."" Being a Chinese myself and have attended numerous banquets, I have never seen fruit being served at the beginning and soup at the end. It will help if Ms. Visser can clarify what kind of banquet she had actually observed or attended. The regular way is soup being served close to the beginning after the cold and hot appetizers, and fruit is served at the very end together with dessert."
5,In Honor of Harry McBilberry,"I hadn't heard of the Futures until a few days ago. I was a big fan of Harry McBilberry when he was with the Temptations. When he left the group I had hoped he would someday reunite with the Temptations, but I lost track of him. I was reading a website and saw that Harry had passed away 3 years ago. I'm still filled with sadness. I heard a medley of his singing that was recorded with The Futures. I immediately tried to locate the cd. I found it here at Amazon. Needless to say I love the cd. My favorite is ""Sunshine and You"". It will make all of us miss Harry McBilberry even more."
4,Very Good!,"One of the best groups to come out of Philly. This group definitely did not get the recognition they deserve. This is a compilation of two really good albums. A must have in your collection if you're a fan of ""TSOP"" (The Sound Of Philly)."
5,Love this group -- The Futures,One of my all time favorite song is not on this compilation and that is Breaking Up and I agree with the previous comments. They are certainly underrated and should have been among the top with groups that did harmonize. The album part time party man that came out in 78 or 79 is just great from start to finish and most if not all selections are on this cd. Excellent buy.
4,"New Feeling, But Great","This album will sound different compared to the earlier Steel Pulse albums because of the typical 80's recording techniques, but they work well on this album. The first four songs are brilliant, and the last four are good as well. Overall, a good album, all the songs being nice. My favorites are Tightrope, Throne of Gold, and Roller Skates."
4,Uplifting Reggae with a Social Direction - A Classic UK CD,"The Rasta Boys from Birmingham dropped this album in the early 80s, and tracks like ""Steppin Out"" and ""Wild Goose Chase"" were immediate smashes throughout the worldwide reggae community. Music like this is timeless, and unfortunately the world is not a nicer place than it was when they recorded the album. The message is there for anyone smart enough to have a listen. The keen synthesizer and vocoder bits add brilliantly to the record. Every complete reggae collection should include ""Earth Crises""."
5,Sure to Bring a Smile!,I had a copy of this tape back in college and recently heard it again. Steele Pulse Rocks out! You will be very happy with this addition to your collection. Great for any occasion!
2,Slick as a slimeball,"Slick, polished, poppy. Ughh! When Steel Pulse keeps it real, there's great reggae to be heard. But this disc is firmly on the pop side of the group's coin, and the listener suffers for it. If you like pop-reggae, that's fine; maybe you'll like this. If you like real roots reggae as I do, try the group's far stronger efforts like ""Handsworth Revolution"" or ""True Democracy,"" and steer clear of this."

3,Benise Carnaval,"Benise is a great talent and wonderful performer, but this CD only had a few cuts that were his beautiful arrangements alone. The rest of the cuts have female wailing that is more than difficult to listen to. Its like fingernails on a chalkboard."
1,Total Dreck,"Being a John Lennon fan I bought this on vinyl years ago. Boy do I feel like a sucker. There is no music on this - just John & Yoko's pretentious avant-garde ""art"". Anyone who claims to enjoy this is either lying or just nuts. If Lennon had not been a Beatle then this would never have seen the light of day. Save your money for actual music."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"Avant Garde! Sound Art! Give me a break!!!! This thing is complete, intolerable garbage! I have very eclectic musical tastes, and listen to most anything, but this crap is absolutely painful to listen to. And maybe that's the whole point. It is an outpouring of emotion and pain that followed Yoko's tragic miscarriage, but to actually put this on CD and have people buy it, is a joke. The opening track, ""Cambridge 1969"" is a 26 minute piece of intolerable pain, which features Yoko's offkey screaming, accompanied by John trying to match the pitch of her screams with feedback from his guitar. If you can last the entire 26 minutes on this one, without going into a fit of rage and breaking something, you are a stronger person than I. Let's face it---the only reason Yoko ever sold anything was because of her association with John Lennon. This is awful stuff."
1,"Unfinished Musick #2, Life with the Liars","This is another example of sheer Lennon stupidity and Ono insanity. Unlike Two Virgins, where random noise was recorded and passed off as avante garde musick; Life with the Lions has a theme. However, that theme is sickening. First, you are treated to loud screeching accompanied by Lennon's feedback guitar. This collection of foolish noise takes you through Yoko's ridiculous ""singing"" and poetry, an infant's death, two minutes of absolute silence, and two people playing with a radio.Like Two Virgins, this collection of musick should be avoided at all costs. Don't waste your money on this CD, Two Virgins, and / or the Wedding Album. You'll be very disappointed.I really don't know why these collections of trash were released in CD format. They sold terribly as albums. Just what are they thinking?"
3,"Life With The Lions, not for your MP3 player","I bought the record of this when it first came out, I did not know what this record was about, no body did sounds like this. All very strange to us kids then. I have the Z apple lable record. I know its a type of sound art that Yoko loves to do and John also as on The Beatles White Album Revolution#9. My copy is in mint shape and I played it the other day. No bed For Beatle John, singing news headlines, Babys Heart Beat, Yoko had a miscarriage and the baby will always be remembered here on this record. All of side one is a Yoko voice workout with Johns Guitar jams. This recording is for collectors, its not for the mp3 players. Its part of my collection. My copy is 43 years old, Life With The Lions, Part of the times."
5,I Was Wrong,When I Was About 14 Or 15 Years Old I Bought This CD Thinking It Was A John Lennon Yoko Ono Collaboration Like Double Fantasy Well Back Then I Was Too Unsophisticated To Realize I Was Listening To Art I Wanted To Hear Singing And Not Yoko's I Stupidly Gave It Away Thinking Good Riddance If You Want It You Can Have It Well I Was Visiting My Friend The Other Day And As A Joke She Asked Me If I Remembered It And Put It On She Was Going To Take It Out When I Asked Her Not To She Laughed Because She thought I Wanted To Mock Yoko For An Hour We Sat There Listening To This Amazing Record And It Was Then I Realized I Had Taken The Wrong Attitude About It When I Told Her How I Felt She Offered To Let Me Have It Back But I Said No I'd Buy Another Well Imagine My Shock And Horror To Find It Was Out Of Print Luckily Amazon Had It Thanks Guys
1,This is why one should never use drugs...,"...it gives one delusions of grandeur, a sense that any piece of garbage that comes out of one's mouth is a work of genius. Pure ego. Pretention. Stupidity. Megalomania. Don't blame them so much -- blame us, we who actually bought anything Lennon and the Beatles put out. Now, John came out with his BEST solo album Plastic Ono Band soon after this so it's not John's lack of talent. This is what happens when Cupid strikes you blind...and deaf. Don't even think of buying this. I suppose the only good thing about is hearing the heartbeat of an unborn child and realizing that it is, after all, not a glob of tissues but a baby. So maybe there is some significant ""countercultural"" message in it, after all."
1,Typically Unlistenable,"Not only is this not art, this isn't even good enough to be considered so bad it's funny. John and Yoko being typically pretentious, with the results being typically unlistenable. More than three decades after hearing this for the first time, it grates on me now just as much as it did then."
1,The worst album ever made! Hand's down!!!,"This ""work"" is the worst mass marketed thing that was ever lain down on a piece of wax. I have thoroughly ripped this monument to bombast enough and am only doing this because the Surgeon General forgot to put a warning label on this piece of toxic waste. Just listen to the 30 second trials of each ""song"" on this montage of horror. Don't give Yoko any royalties for this piece of garbage. How bad is this cankerous ode to banality? It is as meaningless and senseless as John's tragic death. Enough said! Yoko, how do you sleep?"
1,ugh,"no need to say more. all the endorsements for this tripe go on & on trying to justify. there's a more accurate description for this that can be summed up in one word...oh what is it?...a four letter word that begins with s & rhymes with hit...ah geez, it escapes me."
2,"Best of the bunch, not like that's saying much...","Random conversation with guitar feedback behind it, clips of read newspaper articles,\a baby's heartbeat...that's bad. There are two tracks I like here: Two Minutes Silence (You'd be hard pressed to find a more self-explanitory title) and Radio Airplay, nice idea behind the latter. At least you get music. Terrible, like Two Virgins and Wedding Album, but I have to say it's the best of the bunch."
1,"Wow................Truly wretched.....No other word, for it.........!!","I bought this, back in 1969. Still not too sure, exactly why. The only thing funny about it, was the horns at the end of Side 1. Otherwise, it's just noise, ie, Yoko's wailing. More of a waste than George Harrison's "" Electronic Sound "". Just a waste of $ 4.98 then."
1,Sickening,"First of all, I am a huge Beatles fan, and like many Beatles fans I decided to check this out. Now I really enjoy the song Revolution #9, and figured this album would be at least something like it. Well I was wrong. There is nothing at all neat like that song. The track of 26 minutes (Yes 26 MINUTES) of sickening, horribly annoying screaming is so terrible it makes me ill Lennon would release this. The Ono ""songs"" are childish nonsense, and also are very annoying. There's nothing on this album worth listening to. Do not buy it."
2,Unfinished Music No.2,"The second in a series of anti-popstar releases designed to, and largely successful in, knocking John Lennon off the pedestal his fans had erected for him. With his new avant-garde wife at his side -- and enough money in the bank to last a lifetime -- Lennon set about ruining his bank value so he could return to being a 'private citizen.' All three albums -- Two Virgins, Life With The Lions & Wedding Album -- are potent reminders of a simpler time when artists could experiment wildly (or just be very silly) and still get released and distributed (erm, somewhat). Rykodisc nicely duplicates the original packaging and the remastered sound quality is, for 1967, pretty darn good.Of course you can't actually LISTEN to this stuff...."
1,Oh yes I tried,"I really tried to listen to this record, to discover its hidden message,hidden secret, hidden whatsoever. But I had to give up. It is unbelievably boring, arrogant and useless. I do love atonal music, I do love John Cage, LaMonte Young, Stockhausen, Goeyvaerts. But here there is not the slightest effort to produce music or even sound. Yoko's screaming is totally void and upsets your stomach. THe radio ""composition"" is totally aimless. You could do this for fun, but it is endlessly arrogant to put this on a record for sale. Yes, I bought it, because of the legend around it, and I have something of a collector's item now. There are two minutes of beautiful music by John Tchicai, at the end of side one. But I'll only play this again to get rid of the dog of my neighbour."

1,Not Suitable For Any Living Creature....,Pure pretention. Anyone really interested in true post-modern art can find more compelling works elsewhere.Minus 5 stars.
5,"interesting book, slim, not what I thought.","This is an interesting book, a slim volume, not quite what I thought (it's also partly in Greek). Worth a look."
4,great literary hoax,"In the late 1890's this book was published as an ancient and recently unearthed work written by a disciple of Sappho, but it was really written by a young French erotic photographer/poet named Pierre Louys. Even the scholars of Greek antiquity and ancient Greek literature were at first duped! But despite Louys' deception, these poems are very nice, worth reading if you enjoy ancient love poetry with slight lesbian undertones.David Rehakauthor of ""Poems From My Bleeding Heart"""
3,Recommended reading for all Golden Dawn people,"This book has been written in true Golden Dawn style.One other reviewer has already mentioned, Israel Regardie himself has recommended this book as essential reading for all believers.I tend to agree with Regardie's opinion, and I also say that all people who are interested in the Golden Dawn should also read this book."
3,"Fascinating reference, not at all practical","First, the book's contents are fascinating, and well worth reading, for the sake of the knowledge. It's a very good reference book for a magickal, arcana, or occult library collection.That being said, the information is not easily used by anyone other than a fairly advanced and experienced practitioner of ritual magick. The rituals are complex and fiddly, and any wrong step will, according to the author, result in a useless or weak talisman.So, it's a mixed review. Good book, interesting information, not at all practical, unfortunately. I'd say buy it if you're interested (as I am) in arcane knowledge, but unless you're a working ritual magickian, don't count on being able to actually make much use of the information it holds."
3,Making Talismans,"A book filled with wonderful information. However! I was a little disappointed when it only had a few chapters in the end that was solely on making these talismans. I really would have liked a more organized and systematic approach to talismans right in the first chapter. I also didn't like the way the author referred to things all around the book for example... ""to do this you must go to this chapter and to do that you must go to this chapter,"" ehh... BUT! I am greatful because the talismans do work. I would've liked a better approach to their creation though. Hope this helps."
3,Very Detailed!! But not at all easy!!,I would highly suggest borrowing a copy of the book 1st or buying used. This book is not at all easy to understand. It seems very well written and researched but will require more reading and research from some people before being able to make the talismans in this book.
2,"Elaborate, detailed, but FULL of mistakes!","The book is full of great information, but the way it was written was like a slap to the face. I'm not even sure if it was sent to an editor! So many blatant mistakes on irrelevant stuff like syntax, not to mention more serious mistakes relevant to the content. Half finished tables, redundant information... I was very insulted.The book gets at least 4 stars for content, but because it was very incompetently presented, I can only give it a 2."
2,More rubbish,"When the Dodd, Mead; Tarcher/Putnam; and Science of Mind copyrights on Holmes's work ran out, rubbish like this began to surface, created by someone with too much time on their hands and zero motivation to learn about the subject matter. A sure sign of the quality is there on the cover: the author's first name is misspelled, for crying out loud. Avoid these shoddy knockoffs and buy a used copy of the original if you have to, though most of these remain in print."
1,A complete waste.,"After listening to a second of each of the songs on this CD, the listener will undoubtedly realize that Whitesnake songs just don't sound good with just vocals and (horrible sounding) guitar. They sound far too empty. These are songs that NEED heavy drums, keyboard, bass, and electric guitar. It's respectable that Coverdale didn't forget about the band who got him on his feet - Deep Purple - by including ""Soldier of Fortune"", but this song and all the rest should never have been released in this stripped down way. Once again, far too empty."
4,Very pleasant relaxing listening,"David+Adrian prove that a song has to have a solid foundation to sound good.All the guitars+drums+effects don't do any good if the songs suck.These songs DO NOT suck.The songs sound good because of the emotion put into them by the performers.David sings every word like they come straight from his soul.He is so ""into it""that he sometimes has trouble singing,and not doing the ""Tarzan vocal""(His words,not mine).The emotion in his voice is unmistakeable."
4,Great CD that no one knows about,"Great acoustic CD featuring David Coverdale and Adrian Vandenberg. It is performed in Japan in front of what sounds like a room of 20 very lucky people. Great sound quality and a really enjoyable CD. Seller shipped the CD fast, it arrived in good condition and exactly as stated in product description. Great seller and would have no problem buying from again."
1,Looks good until it dries,"I have a 2001 BMW. The trim was still in decent condition but I wanted to renew it and wanted it to look like new, which is what this product claims to do. This apparently was the product to use. I started applying the product and though it looked pretty good at first, until the dye dried. Once dried, I couldn't really tell any difference. It looks exactly like it did before applying ""Forever Black"". Even after two coats, I can't tell the difference."
1,Looks good until washed,"I cleaned the faded black bumpers and trim on my 2003 Volvo S60 - the back bumper was seriously faded. I then masked the adjacent paint and applied 2 good coats of forever black - In all the process took about 2 hours. The car really looked good then, almost like new. My impression was, ""cool, this stuff is great!"". Judging by how difficult it was to clean up the spills, it seemed that it was going to stick and be durable. However, because I wanted to make sure the ""dye"" had cured, I did not wash the car for about 3 weeks. Then I used one of those automatic car washes that are at gas station/ convenience stores. The side trim still looks good but the rear bumper has lost most of the ""dye"" - it just washed off during the first wash! Maybe your results will be better if you have the time to hand wash your car, but do you really have time to always do that?"
3,True Punk,"Good punk rock, well before the punk scene even existed. It's an error to claim this inspired anyone, but Yoko still gets kudos for being at the forefront. This is her best record."
5,COOL YOKO!,"So many of these songs are just plain amazing...I guess it's hard being original- but she is. One of a kind, John saw it and so did a few of us. Glad to see it's taken a year or two and people see what we saw all along. Check out SEASON OF GLASS."
3,Onorock,"This double-disc set marks the beginning of the era when Yoko Ono started building on her avant-gard, grunge-lite sound with a more rock oriented approach. It is a flawed album yes, and could quite easily have been edited onto a single disc, but it is undoubtedly an interesting listen. The proto-punk madness of ""Yang Yang"", the mesmerizing tonal poetry of ""Song for John"" and ""Winter song"" and the haunting pop sensibility of ""Death of Samantha"" display her talent for composing off-kilter, yet moving, rock that in time would become as notable as her early avant-garde work."
4,Yoko as Icon: better than Styxx,"Yoko for you useless bashers, was ( and still lives on ) as a pre-patti smith punk/feminist pro-tolerance creature of confrontation and peace who coupled with the late great John...became a centerpiece for young girls/women on the edge who had nothing more to ""look up to"" than Linda Rondstadts frickin' knee-hi's. Yoko was explosive and daring and the ultimate alien... Geez... give john credit. He wanted to 'break up the beatles' in 1965. Buy this. or borrow it. people with balls are rare. and yoko had 'em."
1,No stars,This 'recording' is right down there with her noxious 'Fly'It could make me want to break my stereo if I had to listen to it again.
1,One of the Worst in a Career FULL of Bad Albums,"Vapid, pretentious and embarrassing. Yoko Ono had no talent when this disc was first released, and nothing has changed in that respect. This album, even more than some of her others, demonstrates just how full of herself she was. SO bad!"
1,This whole album sucks butt!!!!!!!!,"This whole album is pretty much the worst thing that ever happened to music. If you have a yoko ono cd, i quickly advise to burn it and/or break it. The song ""Don't worry (and so on and so forth)"" was the funniest song i ever heard. This is not beautiful, it is a total disaster, and I can't believe that it is even considered music. I only gave it 1 star because no stars was not an option.- a very disatisfied customer"
5,Perfect,Awesome onesie. It is definitely just what I was looking for and the quality of it is great. Would buy again!
3,An excellent addition to Alan Silvestri collectors,"For anyone out there who is an Alan Silvestri fan, this score is for you! I remember years ago when I first watched the film and was completely taken in by Silvestri's score for just the opening credits. Since then I have searched high and low for the soundtrack unable to find it anywhere, until now. I will be brutally honest when I say that this is not the best original score for a suspence thriller. So if you're looking for a really good suspence thriller soundtrack, you may want to look elsewhere. But for someone who enjoys the deep rythmic sounds of Alan Silvestri, this will make an excellent addition to your collection. (If you like this sountrack, definately check out Predator 2, The Quick and the Dead, and What Lies Beneath.)"
2,Includes old version of ArcGIS,"The tutorials are a bit weak, especially if you already know something about ArcGIS 8.x and are hoping to learn some more.My biggest complaint is the out of date Arc software you get, and a 30 day extensions trial demo is not long enough.I also noticed ESRI is totally embracing MicroSoft: right down to the cover color scheme of the book matching the XP upgrade box graphics. Maybe thats why the first couple incarnations of 8.x are so bad."
1,no support for demo software.,This was a waste of $50.00. I was unable to register the ArcGIS Demo Edition software and there is no support available on-line or on the ESRI website for this problem. When I called ESRI for assistance their response was for me to go to the website. The book is useless because the software is useless. So beware!
1,It stinks,"It really stinks, its horrible, poor tutorial examples, terribly wrtitten, obviously ESRI needs to hire some better staff.Ive read some bad books , but this one is in a class by itself. It abuses the right to be awful, taking the reader to a low level. I sure hope no instructors think this might be a good text book, I don't think its even a good paperweight."
2,"Ok for demonstrating functionality, but not learning","I used this book in two classes this fall. While the illustrations are nice, it was a little too simplistic. Not enough emphasis on concepts and applicability. Also, shows program as deceptively easy for success with all data on the CD's provided and compatible. Not exactly how things work in real-life. Basically, a walk-through, follow-the leader exercise book."
2,"Good for beginners, not much else","I am always reticient to give a poor or lukewarm review of a book, or to ""damn it with faint praise"", but this is not what I expected. Basically, a glorified user's manual/tutorial. It's great if you're a beginner who wants to get up to speed on using the software, but the book is mostly page-after-page of screen shots with very little text. If you're the programming type (like I am), keep shopping..."
4,GIS Desktop,"Very thorough text on ArcGIS - one of the best I've read for actual use of it. Unfortunately, it doesn't address theory of GIS programs in general that well, and I felt like my hand was being held a little too much in some things. Overall, I'm very pleased with this, and the 6-mo copy of ArcGIS Desktop that comes with the book is the cheapest way I know of to get a fully functional copy - just buy another one when your current one is expired, it's still cheaper than the software :)"
2,Unhelpful if starting with scratch data,"This book runs you through excercises to familiarize you with the layout and tools the program offers. It utilizes pre-made coverages and data sets that, although useful to play with, allow the author to avoid teaching you how to generate new or initial coverages. I would think once we're done converting 3.x to 8.x we want to generate original coverages, and this book really doesn't help you figure out how to do that. So although it's a reasonable resouce, it's not the end all be all guide - and I don't know what it."
5,Roxaynne Smith's Revew!,"This is a really funny book. I am madly in luv with Captain Underpants, because he's nicer than that ""Lumpy PottyBiscuits"" Principal Krupp. I liked it when Mr. Poopypants changed HIS name to Tippy TinkleTrousers... Ha haha! Great book for ""laffs."""
1,What was Dav Pilkey thinking?,"Yes, it's possible to get children to read anything that is slightly naughty (in this case, severely scatalogical), but are the parents who rave over their children's willingness to read this level of literature also pleased if their children are wild about junk food? Perhaps they are, because America's children are not only nutritionally challenged, but it seems that they are also deprived of literature that would add more to the substance of their lives than a collection of naughty words and episodes. What a pity! The only encouraging note about these books is that the buyers also bought books by J.K.Rowling, Lois Elhert and Rosemary Wells. I hope this represents a balanced literary meal for young readers."
5,The Best Book I Ever Read !!!,"Welcome to Captain Underpants And The Perilous Plot Of Professor Poopypants. I think you will like this book because it is funny, humorous, and interesting.This book is about two boys named George Beard and Harold Hutchins. They are the ones that make it funny. The way they make it is they change the school song and that makes the teacher really really mad.But there is a science teacher, his name is Professor Poopypants. He tries to take over the city that they live in.The machine he tries to use is THE SHRINKY PIG 2000 machine. If you want to find out the rest you have to read the book."
3,Captain Underpants,"Gorge Beard and Harold Hutchines are trouble makers that could not go on the field trip because they got in trouble. Both of the boys had to clean the teacher's lounge and it had to be spotless by the time the children got back. George and Harold wanted to get even with the teachers so they did some mean things. And the teachers quit teaching. Then the children got a new teacher and when the teacher told his name, Professor Pippy P. Poopypants, the children laughed. He showed them the Gerbil Jogger 2000 to try to teach them science. After that Professor Poopypants got so mad he made a shrink ray and shrank the school. Then Captain Underpants flew down and fought against the robot. I like this book. Because the lauphter is so much. Anyone who likes fun books like it."
1,It's the best of the best!,"I am 7 in 2nd Grade and this book is soooooo cool! My new name is Pinky Girtlefanny. I like when Mr. Krupp said, ""Lumpy Krupp? I don't want to be called Lumpy Krupp!"" and then he noticed that his new name was Lumpy Pottybuiscuits. Praise for Gidget Hamsterbrains!"
1,Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants,It is disgusting that this trash passes as children's literature in America. Who is Dav Pilkey? I was surprised when my son got this book from the school library. I can't believe that schools encourage kids to read this garbage. Isn't there anything better that american authors can offer for growing kids in this country? No wonder people complain about falling education standards in this country.
2,>:(,"This book was weird. VERY weird. Some evil scientist tries to take over the world by shrinking them and changing their names to teach them a lesson for making fun of HIS name. Finding out what my name is was fun-Stinky Lizardbreath-but the plot was stupid. Some parts were funny, but mostly dumb. The flip-o-rama didn't work, and it was just plain weird. DON'T BOTHER"
1,"Stupid book, stupid series","I read many Captain Underpants books, including this one, when I was a reading tutor. The books are of very poor quality. There are many misspellings in the drawings and comics. The books are all very predictable. There is very little substance in these books. I would recommend that parents encourage their children to read higher-quality book series such as Beverly Cleary's books, Berenstain Bears, Amelia Bedelia, Magic Treehouse, Magic School Bus, or Miami Jackson."
5,An entertaining book for people who love words.,"Verbiage for the Verbose is addictive. Once you pick it up and try to figure out translations of the phrases in complicated English, you'll be hooked!"
2,Must've been on mushrooms....,"On first play this is so so,harsh and almost unlistenable. Much more introspective than Kristens previous effort 'Hips and Makers. After a few plays however some of the hooks do grab you. Lots of plaintive cries about aching and loss. (I think, the lyrics are pretty obscure). The sparse strings and yearning needy, little girl voice does give an atmosphere to the album but to me the whole feels sad, whiny and dysfunctional. This is the poorest effort ever by Kristen. The lyrics are obscure and inconsequential, Kristen's whine grating as never before. The overwhelming depression about it means that I could only listen to this on my my own. If you like Lisa Germano this is your bag."
1,Just terrible,"What was I thinking? I heard a song from this CD about a year ago, wrote down the name and filed it for later. Finally made the purchase, and now I am stunned at how boooooooring it is!"
3,It's both strange and angelic.,"I picked this album up because I'm a fan of ""Throwing Muses"", and I assumed her solo work would be something like that. Well, the similarities are there, but this is no ""The Real Ramona"". ""Strange Angels"" is pretty much an acoustic album, so it's not really alt-rock, as much as it is a folky singer/songwriter kind of thing. Overall it's good, just not great. Because it's only her singing and playing, many of the songs tend to sound the same, all good, just similar. I doubt this is her best release, but if you're a fan, especially of her voice and guitar work, you should love ""Strange Angels""."
5,HAUNTINGLY REAL,"this is the most real and moving cd i have ever listened to in my life. you can't listen to this cd without feeling shivers, as corny as that sounds. it just is like, the soundtrack to all my feelings and problems. however, kristin hersh is not for everyone. her voice and songs are completely raw and vulnerable and deep, and not for those who like music without meaning or feeling. but for those who do, strange angels would be a perfect match."
3,Nice book. I wish it was B/W,lego manuals without Colors are like the ocean without water.The book is nice but I am not going to buy another B & W lego book.
4,p-touch tapes,Very satisfied with my purchase. Smooth transaction. This clear tape has been difficult to find
5,"Brother TZ-121 Tape - 9mm 3/8"" CLEAR","I have used the Brother P-Touch labeling system for about 8 years now with my labeler being a P-Touch 1750. It is versatile with all of the interchangeable tapes that are offered for it. It has many different types of fonts, styles and accents. My recent purchase was the TZ-121 - 3/8"" clear on black tape cartridge. It is perfect for my application as I use it on the leader of 16mm motion picture film to identify each reel. These labels stay on under repeated use traveling through the film path of the 16mm projector. The TZ-121 tape features the new crack and peel backing which is easy to remove and apply. I also use several other cartridges such as the TZ-211 1/4"" black on white tape, the TZ-221 3/8"" black on white tape, the TZ-641 3/4"" black on yellow tape and the Looney Tunes tape. All in all, I can't think of a better system for creative labeling."
1,TERRIBLE,This is the second time you've asked me what I thought about this purchase. A month ago I ordered some Cartridges from Amazons' Tims' Store and have received Nothing. I repeat RECEIVED NOTHING !!!!!!!!!! In a Months Time but repeated question emails from you asking how I liked it. Still Nothing !!!!!
5,Everyone should have this book/cd,"We were on vacation in Cabo San Lucas a year ago, and a hurricane came through. The hotel room had a CD player, and the book Deep Sleep 101. We listened to the CD all day every day. it kept us calm in the storm. Of course we now have our own copy, and it plays nearly each day at our home. Now when we travel. (like this week) The Deep Sleep 101 CD is a must pack.Enjoy"
4,A very readable history,"A briskly-paced narrative of the first circumnavigations, including accounts of Spanish, English and Dutch expeditions, to exploit the Americas and, especially, the Far East. A real page-turner(!)"
5,Great Case,I just love this case it really protects my 280E .Being a boater and since I hook the unit up to my radio I wish it did have inserts like other waterproof cases to cover the delicate contacts Also would wish it had stopping points on the belt clip as my cell phone does.I gave it a 5 star because it really is a great case though.
4,review,"It fits well and it looks like it protects well. The screen guard is great. Other complaint is how the belt clip was designed. Also, it collects dust easily but for 15 bucks, it's a good buy."
4,Good case,"This is a good case to protest my Sansa mp3 player. The only thing I really don't care for is the big plastic piece in the back to attach to a belt clip. You can't remove this piece, so it sticks out and makes it impossible to put this on an arm band or anything. Otherwise it's a great product, and has protected my mp3 player great the couple of times I've dropped it."
3,"Expensive, dirty in two seconds, but overall o.k.","If you don't want your MP3 player bumped around, then this case should help, but it comes at a huge price as if you haven't already noticed. Plus, it's a magnet for every piece of dust hanging in the air too, so don't be suprised if it looks a lot worse compared to the pics you see online as soon as you begin to use your device. Also, the ""protective screen"" is o.k., but it has similar problems with becoming dirty quickly. Also, have fun putting the thing on. Imagine trying to put on a tiny wetsuit over a Ming vase and that's about how it feels to get it on your player without harming it. Overall, it does what it says it does and that is it protects your player, but between the way too high price and experience of finding it difficult to clean, you might be better off putting your player in a ziplock filled with those handy shipping peanuts."
