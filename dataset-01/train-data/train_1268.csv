1,Bad,"I never really watched the whole thing. It was so bad and pathetic, I couldn't watch it. A bunch of idiots acting like morons, that's what this is. And besides, who wants to watch a video that's just taped off the broadway stage. The songs are terrible and the plot is disgusting. Don't watch this. It is ridiculous."
5,BROADWAY IN YOUR LIVING ROOM,"Back when I was in my teens, I remember all the raves about Sweeney Todd and Angela Lansbury's performance; in addition, my cousin is an avid fan of B'way musicals, so when I saw it on DVD, I jumped at the opportunity and purchased it, and I was not the least dissappointed! my cousin and I thoroughly enjoyed it! it was as if we had been transported to a Broadway theater - the performance was flawless, and the storyline superb!!! it converted me on the spot! now I'm eagerly checking for more shows of this nature in DVD format. I really recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Broadway musicals to purchase it; sit back, relax, and enjoy the show......"
5,Best Version Ever,This version is better than the movie staring Johnny Depp. It has all the songs and is beautifully done. Angela does a great job at portraying Mrs. Lovett. A must see and a must buy!
4,Attend the Tale of Sweeney Todd,"The video captured the story of Sweeney Todd and presented it in a very entertaining manner. Angelea Lansbury was absolutely fantastic and Mrs. Lovett, and it was odd for me to see her change to a crazy, people-pie-making old fart from sweet, lovable Jessica Fletcher from Murder She Wrote. George Hearn did a very nice portrayal of Sweeney Todd, but i personally prefer Len Cairou from the origional brodway cast recording which also features Angela Lansbury. The music from the recording and the music in the movie are slightly different, although effecive because the music, when cut, kept the viewer's intrest. Overall, this production was created into a very well done video."
5,At long last!!,"I have been waiting for this musical to come out on DVD for a long time. Sadly I could not get the video as I live in Wales, so have had to wait till now. Hooray to the powers to be for releasing Sweeney Todd. I must admit I am biased about Angela Lansbury because this wonderful lady has been a favorite of mine for a long time, and her performance in this musical, was breath taking. She could be funny and yet you could see the sad person underneath this Mrs. Lovett. The irony of the musical is that Mrs Lovett does not see anything wrong is putting a little 'extra something' in her 'tasty pies'. Of course, George Hearn, is brilliant as Sweeney Todd. I am so looking forward to getting my DVD, as it will arrive by my birthday, so what a present to have eh??Thank you Amazon for your great service!"
3,Exactly what I wanted.,I'd never seen the play and this was the perfect answer. And the price was right for just a one-time view.
2,You guys thought Pippin had bad camera work?,"Well you obviously haven't seen this production of Sweeney Todd! In comparison to this version of Sweeney, Pippin has amazing cinematography.Now yes this is a good musical, yes this is the version with Lansbury and the first version with Hearn. But cinematography wise, this version is a complete train wreck. For one there's too many closeups during the drama scenes, not allowing us to see the rest of the set. As for the far shots and shots from above, they become more of a distraction than anything else. The editing is quite bad too- constant jump cutting, which makes ruins the ""filmed at one show"" thing. I wish my hair could randomly fix itself without me touching it like Hearn's in ""A Little Priest""! Actors' poses change positions, not to mention some songs looked lip synched due to bad production.In short, steer clear of this horrid video, look for a bootleg of the same tour, or get the concert version with Neil Patrick Harris and Patti LuPone."
2,Don't Toss Your VHS!,"Thanks to some nameless technician somewhere in DVDland who doesn't understand ""live"" theatre, we have one of the worst transfers in DVD history. ""Sweeney Todd"" depends upon the audience interactions with the cast; otherwise the actors/singers look ridiculous and mere cartoons. While the sound from the stage is wonderfully clear, the audience reactions are so muted and remote that, even with the sound amplified, they are in the next county. What a poor decision! What a waste of a wonderful performance! And I saw this production live two weeks before it was videotaped. (I can only hope that someone with surround-sound will let us know that one can actually hear the audience around you!) Otherwise, it's a poor investment!"
3,Could have been better,"A rather primitive recording of the touring version of Hal Prince's original production, which was an interpretation of the show too coarse, broad and ""in your face"" for my tastes. I'd prefer a tad more uplift, a little less misanthropy - and in particular I think Lansbury's interpretation of Mrs Lovett is not funny or warm enough. No-one looks like they are enjoying themselves much and it left a sour taste in my mouth, so I felt let down. Musically however it remains one of Sondheim's most fascinating and uniform scores, so I guess any recording is worth owning and we are lucky to have this one to study."
4,The not-such-a-demon barber of fleet street,"It is easy to see why Angela Lansbury won a Tony for this peformance. The sets, scenery and costumes are wonderful. The cast is quite effective, but at times it is very hard to distinguish some of the lyrics in the larger production numbers. A must see for anyone that is aware that Tim Burton is going to bring his own unique take on this story to life."
2,Not as good as I remembered.,"When I bought the Sweeney Todd in Concert DVD, I reviewed that it was a good place-holder until this DVD came along. I was wrong. Except for Lansbury's performance, there's entirely too much about this production that makes the more recent concert version more recommendable. For starters, the camerawork doesn't age well, with cheesy closeup shots that steal thunder from the hugeness of the staging. This is hardly a deal-breaker though; however the supporting performances are. Hearn and Lansbury are great. Lyndeck is good. The young lovers on the other hand are wretched. The actress who plays Johanna makes this DVD nearly impossible for me to watch.Of course those are personal problems; your mileage may vary. The transfer is decent, preserving the quality of the '82 video. I'm glad to own this for archival purposes. It's nice to see the original set and some of the original performances. Those make this DVD worth picking up."
1,"THIS ""PAIR"" OF OVEN MITTS ARE TWO DIFFERENT COLORS EVEN THOUGH THEY CAME IN THE SAME BOX.","THE OVEN MITTS ARE RECEIVED ARE TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT COLORS! ONE IS A NICE ""SHINY"" SILVER, AND THE OTHER ONE IS A DULL GREY COLOR... I KNOW THEY'RE JUST INEXPENSIVE OVEN MITTS, BUT THEY'RE NOTICIBLY DIFFERENT, AND SINCE EACH ONE WAS PACKED IN CLEAR PLASTIC (THEY DIDN'T COME ""HOOKED"" TOGETHER), SO, IT'S LIKE THEY'RE FROM TWO DIFFERENT COLOR CHOICES.... OR BATCHES THAT JUST GOT TOSSED IN A BOX AND SENT SO I DON'T EVEN WANT TO HANG THEM NEXT TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY DON'T MATCH AT ALL...."
3,Average,I don't have any issues with these mits but they r nothing special. I was most disappointed in the color. I thought the would be silver but they were dull gray. They definitely don't wash well but I can still grab out a hot pan after several washes.
2,Only 1 Oven mit Arrived,"Description clearly indicates set of 2, but only 1 oven mit arrived! Oven mit is also thin material. I would not purchase this again"
3,Exterior material won't last,"My interpretation of ""Commercial"" equals ""Heavy-Duty"" or ""Built to last"". These gloves do not deserve that description. They are lightweights compared to my previous Weber oven mitts. I'll use them until they fail and then I'll buy leather fireplace gloves or Weber oven mitts to replace them (which I expect to be in the very near future).12/08: Yup they're history. 450 degree Dutch oven killed them."
2,Not What Was Expected,"Here was an opportunity for a clearly-bright gay porn star to provide some insight into what makes him tick. I was hoping for autobiography but also self-revelation. Why did I go into this line of work? What keeps me doing it? What trade-offs are there? But instead this is a relatively monotonous stream-of-consciousness ""diary"" with little introspection. It's reporting, not analysis. A few interesting moments but mostly a disappointment. I was hoping to find brains behind the brawn. Not so much."
2,The banality of pornography,"Though labeled by some as an autobiography, ""My Undoing"" is more a journal of a year or so in Aiden Shaw's life both before and after a roadside accident which left him partially paralyzed. Much of this journal consists of accounts of which drugs Aiden did in which nightclub in the company of which people. It quickly becomes repetitious and a but dull. Perhaps the private life of a porn star is better left to the imagination because in this account, Aiden's life seems shallow and limited."
3,He's a Fool,"The book is well written but the man's a fool. He's openly HIV+ yet still has promiscuous sex (that is, tops) w/o a condom.At one point he says his sex partner is making ""an informed decision"" not to ask Aiden to put on a condom, yet how can anyone make an informed decision in this book? They're all taking fistfuls of drugs.Here's a passage from the book that shows the extent of drug use: ""Within minutes, back at the apartment, we had smoked, snorted, and swallowed every bit of crystal, cocaine, Ecstasy, Special K, hash, and acid we could lay our hands on. I can't remember ever doing so many drugs in such a short time.""Whoopie.The man's a train wreck that happens again and again."
1,My Poor Grass...,A bigger mistake than the writing of this book was my reading it. I can hardly believe I let my grass go uncut just to make it thru each chapter. If you aren't looking for heroes- or even anyone to like or admire- then this book might serve some need you have. As it turned out- it served no need for me.
1,Shallow and clueless,"Presumably this was written because Mr. Shaw needed money. If he actually intended to share something with a reader - a not unjustifiable expectation on the part of a prospective reader - he failed incredibly well. The title leads one to think that love may actually be part of what is presented and hopefully some insight into that elusive and very pervasive human emotion. However, Mr. Shaw gives the reader neither insight, nor even the occasionally well written sentence. At best this reads like the narcissistic memoir of an inflatable doll. Scratch beneath the handsome picture of Mr. Shaw on the cover and you'll find that there is no there there, as Gertrude Stein once said. And that's the kindest thing that can be said on the basis of what's presented as his life in this book. I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,An introspective of self-love,"I really enjoyed this book. Easy reading and it takes you into his personal journey of life, NOT merely that which provides some steamy memories for Aiden Shaw. He's raw and uncensored in the truth of his discovery of himself, his triumphs, as well as his vulnerabilities!"
1,Bad Reading,"This book exposes Aiden Shaw as lazy(he does nothing but take drugs)and pyschotic(he has unprotected sex and has diseases) and by the end there is no hope of self improvement.This book also exposes us the reader as shallow for even buying it in the first place.I think the saddest part is that Aiden Shaw so desperately wants to contribute to society but has nothing to offer except his body and hasnt realized.I dont believe him either,his drug consumption makes him an unreliable witness to his own pointless existence.I give him one star because its only fair considering how tragic Aiden Shaw must be."
3,Missing Core,"This book starts out in a fast and exciting pace, but halfway through one begins to wonder ""where is it all going?"" Aiden Shaw tells an incredible narrative in a comprehensive, easy to read, subtlety poetic form. However, it's void of any and all emotion. Even in scenes of breakdown or crying, all the reader is offered is the notion he was crying but in no way do we know how he was feeling, other than obviously sad. I thought by reading this I would get an exclusive look inside the life of a porn star and hustler, gain a perspective and a respect for a niche of men whose lifestyles aren't something I would approve or emulate. But all I really got was a tremendous list of what the author had done, disastrously, from point A to B to C. In the end, I'm glad to have read this book as it gives the feeling of being let in on a secret. However, the secret isn't all together too interesting and lacks that personal edge in which I was hoping to find."
2,Mr. Sad,"I couldn't put this book down, because I was anticipating the turning point, where Mr. Shaw realized that his life of sex and party drugs was ruining his life. Shockingly, that time never arrived. Shaw is against taking a prescribed anti-depressant because it interferes with his sexual potency, but he has not hesitation taking cocaine, crystal meth, and LSD on a regular basis, which can't help his HIV status too much. He does a lot of crying and very little introspection. There are numerous relationships with toxic people, most of whom he thinks are his friends.I am curious as to what the author thinks his ""undoing"" really is. In my opinion, his undoing is the fact that he is totally unable to realize how dysfunctional his life is and how much he needs to change it."
4,Improving the On-Q Enclosure,"For those who have the On-Q Enclosure installed, the extender is an excellent way to provide more depth and contribute to better control of wiring, plugs and receptacles contained in the basic box. Improves appearance and air circulation when the door is closed. Not easy to find in local store inventories, even big box hardware stores."
3,Budget Kit,"I had expected more from this kit! While it covers the basics fine, its more of a starting point than anything else! It gives some examples of how to budget using forms but thats it, no blank ones are included, its a real case of do it yourself!"
2,Meh.....,"Book is alright, if you really want a budgeting kit get: The Budget Kit: The Common Cents Money Management Workbook , it really spells everything out for you."
5,"Excellent, brilliant, humoristic, serious","There are a lot of words to be used to describe this movie. But not enough space:)With its humoristic tone, but a serious message, this movie is enjoyable from start to end.It might be because I am a Norwegian, and I know the local setting, that makes me enjoy this movie so much (believe me there are not that many successfull norwegian movies;), but it is definately recommended to everyone that wants to see an original movie with an original subject. I can not really describe the movie it self... I can just tell you my feelings about it...:) See it if you want a special experience!"
5,Very sweet funny film...,Very sweet funny film about two Norwegian men who are released from a mental institution and learn to make lives for themselves in state subsidized housing. Good characters and a gentle spirit make for comforting and fulfilling viewing.
5,"if you watch one movie before you die, make it this one.","(and that's saying something, because I am a diehard original star wars fiend.)not that this movie has any relation to star wars; far from it.Elling is an amazing movie. the characters suck you into their world...I've never actually seen this movie in english, but I would recommend it to anyone, everyone, anywhere.(the other reviews seem to have done a good job summarizing the plot, so I figured I'd go for the emotional punch.)"
4,"beautifully acted, wonderfully written","I thought this movie was wonderful. I love the ""odd couple"" friendship Kjell and Elling have. I think the dialog is beautifully written - it truly felt like a novel that came to life. (I later discovered that Elling was actually based on the Norwegian novel). There are some really great lines here, I want to list my favorites.. but I think it would be more enjoyable if you heard them in the movie before reading them here.You'll laugh out loud (and silently) and sympathize wholeheartedly with Elling. I highly recommend this film to anyone who can read. (the movie is in subtitles).The only reason I gave this 4/5stars is that I thought the ending felt a little lingering. If there was a 4.5 I could give, it would have gotten that score."
5,Norwegian Film with a great message,"If you enjoy foreign language films, this might be a winner. This is one of the films I enjoy watching from time to time.Two men who have met in a mental institution are allowed to move into their own apartment in a normal city environment.How they each come to make friends and build a meaningful life the central theme."
3,An interesting film,"Elling is an interesting film that I have enjoyed watching several times. It is a Norwegian film. The storyline centers around two people living in an institution. Eventually, it is decided to allow them to leave and to adjust to society in Oslo, Norway. From then on, this film takes one on an engaging ride as these two try their hand at something that they are not used to. The two main protagonists--Elling and Kjell Bjarne--are played by Per Christian Ellefsen and Sven Nordin. Both perform solidly in their attention-grabbing roles as polar opposite friends. In addition, the rest of the cast turn in memorable roles--for example, Jorgen Langhelle's portrayal of social worker Frank Asli. Elling also gives one an insightful look into what Norwegian society is like. Elling is a good film, and I recommend it."
4,Absolutely charmed me. Still smiling,"This minor gem was made in Norway and was nominated for best foreign film last year at the Oscars. I had forgotten to check it out, but thanks to my friend Rosanne, I did. ""Elling"" is one of those 'charming' comedies about the mentally ill. That said, it works really well thanks to clever dialogue and wonderful acting from the title character, especially. See, these two guys are released to a welfare apartment from the psychological hospital and have to deal with starting a normal life, or they must return. Sweet bumblings ensue. Great movie to watch with your parents that you'll all enjoy."
4,Elling is a wonderful look at life...,"Elling is a wonderful look at life through the eyes of two dysfunctional men learning how to deal with the world. All of lifes little problems are amplified in these two men. Funny, charming and touching. Don't miss this little gem. It is foreign, so subtitles are present, but like all wonderful movies from overseas, you barely notice that you are reading them because the movie pulls you in with it's charm."
4,Lexar 256mb 40x w/Nikon D100,I have always found Lexar to be a good product.But! the 40x may just be hype. The write speed of my Nikon D100did not increase.
1,Rebate not granted as advertised,I have the same experience as the above reviewer. I sent in all the required stuff for a $25 rebate but got rejected. I don't see this card faster than the one come with my Canon digital camera. (...)
2,speed improvement not seen - advertised rebate refused,"I bought this card hoping to see a speed improvement between pictures. Careful experimentation showed only slight improvement for overall disappointing results.Also, $10 rebate offer yielded a refusal. I could have gotten more flash memory for less money with the same overall results,especially since rebate was not honored. (have found other reviewers complaining about lexmark rebate refusuals!)Otherwise...card and software works."
2,Childish yet informative,"To put it bluntly, if you want to know about the life of Barbara McClintock in an easy to read format written for a younger/children audience, then this book is for you. It goes vaguely into details, but does not really eluscidate the experimental procedures used in her work. It is rather vague, and is greatly targetted to be in the children's section of a library. Cheers."
4,WWE Enhanced Footage of ECW,(THE BAD)1ST.When the camera is far back while facing the ring the colors are a little too bright and may hurt your eyes.(DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ARE)2ND.Crowd chants and shouting are edited to the Liking of WWE. :(-------------------------------------------------------------------------(THE GOOD)1ST.Crowd is easier to Identify2ND.Not as Dark as before.---------------------------------------
2,Who chose the matches for this?,"I am very disappointed in what I thought would be an awesome compilation of ECW rarities. While I was happy to see Taz, Rob Van Dam, and Jerry Lynn, there was entirely too much focus on Shane Douglas and not enough on others that should have been included. Where was CW Anderson? Not one thing included on him and I think he is one of the most excellent wrestlers to come from ECW. No Balls Mahoney or Blue Meaney, Chris Candido comes out for a couple minutes, no Dudley Boyz, Brian Lee, or countless others that should have been included. What started out as excitement and I could not wait to see this, quickly turned into disappointment because of the forgotten stars."
3,WWE continues to ruin the Legacy of Extreme,"They blocked out the cursing. They chose not to spend a few extra dollars to secure the rights for the entrance music of the wrestlers. You can tell Vince McMahon, didn't ""get it"". He didn't get that unlike WWE programming, with ECW you need it as it was or nothing at all. Everything intertwined. Unfortunately The only person WWE has working for them from ECW is ""Corporate Ass Clown"" Joey Styles and he doesn't care as long as he collects a paycheck. Matches are great but you've seen them before. Don't let the title fool you."
2,un released - not,This is a very mis leading title for a dvd because yards of ECW shows were released in the UK by the now tragically defunct Delta Music label. Inevitably they showed up on auction sites after they were deleted so the only honest way for McMahon to have put this material out would have been to release stuff that had been hitherto unseen.
1,"just say, NO!",i do remember ecw being on tnn(the national network) for about two years before low rating killed it. ever since then paul heyman has become a blithering egomaniac and only works for that cracker bully brock lesner which mostpeople don't like.
4,A Smoke-filled Cabaret,"As I listened to Mon Legionnaire for the first time, I was transported back to the late 1930s and a smoke-filled cabaret in Paris. Soon there would be war, but not tonight. Edith Pilaf was on stage and war worries were put aside for the evening. The wine flowed."
4,The Smokey Caberet,"With the Mon Legionnaire CD, Edith Pilaf transported me back. Suddenly I was in a smoke-filled Parisian caberet. The time was 1938, on the eve of war. But on this night the war was not yet; the wine followed and Edith sang."
3,Author works too hard.,Purchased this book for insight into Ireland. The author works very hard to use large and confused language to sound educated. Tires you out just reading it. Perhaps it gets better later in the book.
2,"OK, but not as good as it's cracked up to be","The blurbs on the cover way oversell this book- at it's best it comes up to Bill Bryson's average, imho. There are endless passages about planning to drink, drinking, being drunk and recovering from being drunk. Fair enough, you may say- this is a book about an Englishman looking for his Irish roots. Fine, then don't bill the book as avoiding stereotypes. Looking for stupid / loud / ugly American tourists? You'll find plenty. Looking for old-time Irish Catholics? You'll find them. Looking for stereotypical old Ireland with a lick of paint to gussy it up for the millenium? here's your book. It's fine- readable, with some funny bits, but not especially original or insightful. Wait for the library to get it, or at least the paperback version."
3,Entertaining but repetitive,"The pub stories are amusing,but it gets boring reading one account after another about the search for ancient stones. More troubling is the author's constant attacks on the Catholic church. I understand the church's profound influence in Ireland but one reference to preists having [relations] would have been enough. By the eighth or ninth time I was very tired of it.We have all read the stories about priests and altar boys and we know about the Bishop who fathered children. I did'nt need to be hit over the head with it. The place descriptions became repetitive.There are only so many ways to describe a green field. Even the pub stories all read the same after about 200 pages. The author has a good sense of humor but I could'nt get past the feeling that he was told to stretch the book a bit. All in all a decent book that could have done with about 80 pages worth of editing"
2,Cynical Yankee-Bashing 101,"The pot-shots at Americans get old real fast, as you can tell he embellishes his run-ins with them for dramatic effectI found myself skipping over many parts becasue he goes off on cynical rants about everything ""not-local"" about a place.Spare us please, there are 270 million of us and we are not all on our first trip out of the country, not all of us have fat, dopey butts, and we are not all from Texas!If you want to write about the real Ireland stay out of Killarney and Dingle during the high-season...."
1,Humor at the expense of others...,"I finally put the book down. After traveling much of Ireland myself and being especially interested in antiquities I was looking forward to a wonderful read. One wonders what actually motivated him to write. I do not appreciate the humor of ridicule and cultural profiling. At the risk of doing what he has done to so many others in his book, I won't comment further. I only hope that Mr. McCarthy finds some serious help with the unhappiness in his life so that he may channel his sense of humor to enhance rather than debase."
4,McCarthy has a knack,"Some bits were boring but overall this was a very funny book. I am sure it helps that I have been almost everywhere that he traveled to so it was like watching a vacation slideshow. That being said, the best is how he describes tourists from around the globe. Stereotypes????....sure but who cares, he was right on the mark."
5,Audio Book,Fantastic Seller. Professional and Prompt! Super Fast Shipping :)This seller is a safe bet that I would highly recommend to everyone!
5,Hilarious and Informative,"If you love wit that is both droll and fey, then you'll love this book. McCarthy has observed and then served up the Irish and many parts of Ireland very accurately. In the words of my Irish friend who gifted me with the book, ""He actually got it and didn't make a caricature of it."" He wanders through his various observations, settling upon many thoughts and subjects, which is a big part of the book's charm. But if you need a straight style and less complex sentence structures, then you may be one of the folks who won't provide a great review. I, however, couldn't recommend the book more."
4,Not a book for the uptight reader,"This is an easy hilarious trip by someone who sees life as a joy. Some of the negative reviews are possibly by people who are ultra PC. If you have no sense of irony or picking up on the foibles of stereotypes, then go and read the bible, or if you want your travelogue sanitized, go read Bryson."
3,"Usabile, anche se non perfetto.","Il rating si riferisce, evidentemente, alla presentazione sul kindle ( per il contenuto quante stelle si dovrebbero dare...venti, trenta?).La versione che ho scaricato non ha indice attivo, e`pero`facile trovare il canto o il soggetto desiderato (Caronte, Francesca ecc.) colla funzione SEARCH. Molte terzine sono spezzate, i versi si possono pero`facilmente ricostruire sia sulla rima che sul ritmo del verso stesso.Non posso giudicare sulla qualita` del testo, dal punto di vista filologico. Per me, lettore ingenuo, e`comunque perfettamente leggibile. Da consigliare, anche se non perfetto."
5,Glorious,"This is a fine recording of John Rutter's masterpiece. The Choir of King's is exceptional. The recording features the full orchestral accompaniment with amazing soloists, specifically flute, cello and oboe. I am particularly found of performances by all-male choirs of this composer's music - Pie Jesu is breathtaking as a boy soprano solo. I believe this to be the best recording yet on disc of the Requiem. The programme is rounded out by other secular choral works. The Wallace Collection brass ensemble is a great guest on the disc as well. Highly Recommended."
5,Needles of Stone,"Needles of Stone is probably the most definitive and scientific work on the subject of Ley Lines and standing stones. Graves opens his introduction with the words: ""The earth is alive: living, breathing, and pulsing"" His whole theory is based around this maxim, he proposes that the ancient inhabitants of Europe knew this and deliberatly tapped into this energy. Somehow the standing stones and megalithic structures of this mystical time were tapping into and transmitting this energy for the benefit of the land. This is one of the few books that I've read that actually explores the complete history of this theory and proposes new ideas. Much of the research undertaken into Ley lines and standing stones is actually done my tom Graves himself. An excellent work that has little comparison in today's attempts on the subject."
5,"great, tried and true",glad to find a copy of this small and powerful book! Satir's work never gets old and I had lost my previous copy.
1,The Only Myth is in the brain of Mary Lefkowitz,"This is racism and hatred at it's very best...The next thing she'll write about is that Dr King was white...Give her a few centuries and her ""like minded bigots"" will get around to it....It's interesting that a history of a people can only be told accurately by ""proven"" white scholars according to Left-a-witch....Thank God for the brave Afrocentrics that offer a different view of their ""own"" history..."
1,TRUTH CRUSHED FROM EARTH SHALL RISE AGAIN,"Afro-Centrism is not an excuse to teach myth. Whites are just afraid Black People will finally learn the truth, and that scares them."
1,Lefkowitz book: get a good laugh,"Lefkowitz has never set foot on the continent. I shouldstop there but i will go on. I agree withthe refutations against beliefs that are blatantlyincorrect facts. But she too picks and chooses herarguments, contradicting herself plenty of times in theprocess. She needs to check herself and start sweepingher own front porch before she starts cleaning up otherpeople's houses. She is just not ready to admit that AncientAfrica has played a bigger role in the creation of ""WesternCivilization."" That's sad and so is this book. Do not buy it!"
1,Terrible! Nice work of fiction though.,"I hold a degree with honours in Latin and I have never read anything as perversely misleading under the thin guise of an anthropological work. It saddens me to see racists twist history to their own means as Lefkowitz has. Though I would think that if someone were as silly to state that the holocaust never occured she would be among the first to write to the contrary. To entirely discount the immense contributions that the dark continent has made to the world is incredibly foolhardy, and yet that's precisely what Lefkowitz sets out to accomplish using poorly constructed circular logic."
1,Insomnia Cure,"If you want to read an overly detailed diatribe of factoids that are basically just as one-sided as the afrocentric writings the author wishes to refute, then this is the book for you. This book will definitely lead to utter boredom and sleepiness.. It cured my insomnia. I say myths come in all shades...just because the author regurgitates a bunch of ""alleged facts"" doesn't make her factoids truth no more than the other authors she wishes to defame in her book. Basically, it is all a matter of opinion...and it is difficult to trust the facts of a profoundy dishonest ethnic group who has sought to mitigate or reduce to no value at all every other ethnic group that God created, as absolute truth seekers or speakers, especially when they have never been forthcoming and non-biased with regards to historical facts. However, I will give the lady credit for being a good factoid collector. I'm grateful I borrowed this book rather than having purchased it myself."
5,Excellent and thorough analysis and argument,"When political correctness goes too far, history is re-written, facts are twisted and everyone loses. It is unfortunate that Ms. Lefkowitz felt compelled to write this book. But then thanks to the light her book sheds, we, and hopefully our children, are the fortunate ones.This book is not fiction. This book is pure fact. Read this book only if you are capable of handling the truth. This book is not about rasism -- white or black. It is about history. It is about the truth regarding the relationships between Ancient Greece and the other nationalities of the then known world -- the Egyptians, the Libyans, and the blacks Africans who were basically ignored by the Greeks.Excellent work."
5,good book...,"which absolutely and completely demolishes the myth of afrocentrism.i wish to correct a maligned amazon.com rater (who obviously remembered from an old elementary-school map that egypt was indeed a country located (surprise, surprise) in africa)....when someone comments on the fact that africans developed no written languages and doesn't include egyptians as africans...that simply makes sense from an obvious visual and genetic racial background. north africans are not black, in the sense of what is commonly considered black by western standards. you silly fool. is charlize theron considered african-american? now you look as stupid as you are!"
3,Who cares ....,"Books which go out on a limb to celebrate (or degrade) one culture over another is the reason why we have such turmoil today. I did not find this a racist book, it was fair in its accessments, but I don't think whether the ancient Egyptians were Greek, Black, or White is significant. To me it doesn't matter if they were a race of one-eyed cyclops ... What's more important than where we've been is where we're going. And, based upon the bitter and biased reviews this book fomented, I'm more concerned with the latter. I must agree with the reviewer from Los Angeles. There should be less concern about having great ancestors and more on being a good one."
1,African Written Language,"It's interesting how far some people will go to exploit a myth and then lo and behold up pops another one in the reviews. ""Africans (not Egyptians) had no written language"" Ge'ez was the written language of the Ethiopians who last I heard, were Africans."
1,Denile,"The book NoT Out Of Africa by Mary Lefkowitz is a great big lode of (...). Why is it so hard for White America to except the fact that Egyptian Civilization (Khemit) was BLACK? There's Know way possibe that it was Eurocentric. (...) Oh! and one more thing Cleopatra WAS NOT WHITE,and she did not kill herself for the love of two white men. Her first love was EGYPT and she killed herself because of the fall of EGYPT in Roman arms."
1,tsk tsk u are dismissed!,"Actually the Egyptians, and the rest of africa did have written communications, but i wouldnt expect a bunch of charlatans to know the truth about others, they are only concern with their own fabrications. Mary's book is a educator for continuous racism she couldnt even cover her debates without making personal attacks on others lmao! so in the end mary projects empty information, which doesnt cover much ground."
1,This book is an atrosity!,"This book is an atrosity! THis book exemplifies contempporary scholarary racism and presents a bitter disregard for the genius and wisdom for the Black Africans whom were responsible for developing the one of ,if not the greatest civilizations in the world. IT is a shame that authors such as she are allowed to serve as foremost authorities on civilizations of antiquity!"
1,Really?,"The author systematically wages war on Afrocentrism all the while promoting Eurocentrism using the very same techniques she accuses her opponents of. Listening to hypocrisy is hard, sitting and reading through it is worse."
3,"Everyone, on both sides of the arguement, ignores the racial varieties of ancient Egypt!","Tomb paintings in ancient Egypt reveal 4 distinct colors for human beings: White/Fair, Red/Tan, Brown and Black. There are statues of pharaohs and scribes who appear with both Black and Fair skin tones and facial features. Finally, if you look closely at many of the ancient Egyptian statues it can be seen that there is a definite Asian appearance as well, with straight fine black hair and slanted eyes!I think if we accept the fact that Egypt was truly the center of the pre-Roman/Greek world, we can then begin to allow for a multi-racial nation that has now mixed itself into the Middle Eastern appearance."
1,Debate?,"Anyone who states that Afrocentrists are delusional but agree with the Eurocentric lies propagated for centuries should rethink their position. The fact is that the ""real scientists"" have created falsehoods for centuries in order to justify the Eurocentric agenda. Specifically, I am referring to the German scientists during the 19th century who wished to promote the idea of Aryan superiority. Their ideologies circulated as scientific truth for hundreds of years. You can't accuse the Afrocentrists of creating lies and not acknowledge the role played by the ""academia"" mentioned previously. That is pure hypocrisy."
4,Intilligently heroic,"When something makes good sense the human mind, through experience and emperical evidence, destroys with ease any of the doubts that a few free-thinkers in a society raise about any issue. With history, it is those who are not sure of their own that attack those whose history is well documented. And who shall we blame for the lack of a writing tradition among the Negro people of sub-Sahara Africa? This whole lack of an intellectual history that is so identifiable with ancient, and recent, sub-Sahara Africa, is the ROOT of the Afrocentric movement today. Combine this with a lack of identity and what one gets is the most dangerous group of people on Earth today. It is almost as if they have, thanks to Civil Rights and the victimization philosophy of post sixties society, a license to lie. Thanks to Mary Lefkowits for been a hero."
1,her own scholarship is not scholarship,"She makes assertions and criticisms, but, for instance, her claim that the concept of Greek Mystery schools were not derived from Egyptian teachings 1)Ignores the well known statements of Greeks such as Herotidus (and others) adn 2) establishes no scholarly evidence for her claim. She criticizes the author of James ""Stolen Legacy"" for giving only book titles without citing specific pages, yet James work is riddled with page references throughout. This is not scholarship."
3,Afrocentrism Has No Clothes,"Though occasionally pedantic and distracted, this book correctly holds to ridicule those American academic afrocentric mythologists who would create a fairly-tale history of black Africa. With ironic repartee, Lefkowitz notes the adoption of European standards and definitions of cultural greatness by afrocentric scholars in the invention of this imaginary past. The inclusion of Masonic images and lore into the equation seems forced and unessasary in addition to slowing down the pace of the book's entreaty to truth an accuracy."
1,If you are afraid of truth this is the book for you!,I would give this book a flat zero but it gets 1 star because that is the minimun.As a white student am really tired of reading such outdated material.Who really cares what race the ancients were? Only someone who might be afraid of thier own past.All races made significant contributions to society and if blacks were the first it does not bother me.Come'on lets get over it!
1,She' a white racist,"I find her typical of a white racist that cannot separate her racism from even imagining that since Egypt is in Africa, that just perhaps the Egyptians could possibly be African people?? The reviewer from South Africa is a very sick minded, hateful, hostille person who sounds like he hates black people. Why can't whites separate their racist hostility from their discussions?? Just why are white people so nasty, rude and can only see that Europeans and Greeks are history makers??? I'm baffled by the racism that came through her book."
1,If its possible i'd rather not give this a star rating,"It is no shock to see that many like this book. Racism will never die, not while uneducated, unwilling to progress humans inhabit the world. This book, as many other people have mentioned ,has no proof, as much as the fans like to think just because it is a ""scholarly"" person writing that it is factual, it is not. Brainwashed minorities and white people have been trying to debunk anything not from the elites for years. If you chose to waste your money on this then so be it, but, if you are someone looking to change things for the better, to make this world a livable one for all your fellow beings, then do everyone a favor, do the author a favor and do not purchase this book."
2,Eurocentrism at its finest,"It is amazing how inept even the liberal elitist of classical education have become. Despite the works of scholars such as Godfrey Higgins, Bernal and others, the author presupposes a lack of knowledge by the reader and assumes that the traditional ""western"" education is in and of itself a unique development. History is a continuum and proves the author incorrect. She further confuses nationality with race (a european concept itself). For many years the World Book Encyclopedia called Egypt a member of the European group. How asinine! She confuses a nationality (Greek and Egyptian) with race (black and white) What do archeologists say concerning the origins of the ancient Egyptians? Furthermore, basic physics dictate that all colors originate from black. In addition, the black chromosome is dominant; the white, recessive. I am still searching for her logic."
5,Praise the Greeks!,"Ignore those who would promote their own agenda by PC intimidation. It's hard to ignore facts, and Bernal's crowd has none. Hey, I guess the historians were correct: the Greeks are the bedrock of western civilization. Maybe the romans a little."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book was horrible. It was so bad, I didn't even try to resell it, I threw it in the recycle bin. The stories are all about how one half of the couple is a total loser, I suppose in an effort to get you to use anger and hatred to mask your sorrow. Don't poison your mind with this book."
2,not for use with diesel fuel??? thats what the box says!!!,"It would have been nice to have known that this fuel filter was not for use with diesel fuel.I did not see this on the add,but after it shipped to Alaska. I bought the fuel filter to use on a diesel system but in the box it said not for use with diesel fuel.could not use product for my system. Amazon should this be clearly stated in the description??"
4,Solid album.,"Straight outta Flint, MI, comes The Dayton Family's own Ghetto E with his solo debut. And while this isn't as good as his brother Bootleg's solo (Death Before Dishonesty), Ghetto Theater brings more of the same gangsta we've grown to expect from The Dayton Family.The first single, Lolipops, is a stray from that formula, but the results are infectious. This is a track you'll have stuck in your head all day.On the harder side, Ghetto E comes through with tracks like Ball Like Dat (featuring Shoestring and MC Breed), Playa Hatta (featuring Bootleg and Swift D), and Resume Of A Killa (featuring Bootleg, Esham, and Streetlife).The album falters on only a few out-of-place and misguided tracks, but overall, Ghetto Theater is the perfect snack to hold you over until the next Dayton Family album."
5,Ghetto E is off the HIZZE!,"if u down with the dayton family, you have to peep this cd. all the beatz r tight and the lyrics are ill. all the songz u can just let play through from 1-18!! if u liked dayton family FBI then u gotta own this cd!"
1,Shaman Winter - a disappointment,"I've read all three books in this trilogy: ""Zia Summer,"" ""Rio Grande Fall"" and now ""Shaman Winter."" Each book was more disappointing than the previous. I had picked up ""Zia Summer"" because I'd heard good things about Anaya's work and wanted a ""different"" mystery than the type I usually read. Although ""Zia Summer"" was a good ""long-plane-ride"" book, the other two got extremely involved in Sonny's spiritual side and became increasingly ""hocus-pocus""; they didn't spend enough time developing the now flaky mystery with Sonny and his nemesis, Raven. The problems Sonny got himself into seemed misplaced and didn't move the mystery along very well and the ending, especially in ""Shaman Winter,"" seemed too make-believe. From now on, I'll stick with Agatha Christie's Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot!"
2,Expensive and inconsistent.,"These peanuts are tasty, but expensive. Not all the peanuts are spicy leaving it a guessing game as to which one you will get every time you crack one up open. When you do get a spicy one, they are good. However, the non spicy ones don't taste any different than a normal batch of peanuts you can buy anywhere.I wouldn't recommend this product based on the price and the price of shipping. $8 for a bag and $8 for shipping along with inconsistent seasoning on the peanuts makes this a no go."
5,Praise and Worship songs of Richard Smallwood,just what I wanted and needed.best gosel CD of all time. I need more for gifts these worshi songs will never play out.
2,disappointed,This book was not what I was expecting. It was a Christmas gift and I was ashamed to give it. It looked like someone had printed it on a computer and copied it. I did not read the content.
3,"Old Fashioned, but good material for oral storytelling","Although I knew this would not be contemporary material, I was expecting it to be more like Grace Livingstone Hill's timeless stories. However, the principles are usually strong, so this would be a good book to read, then RETELL to your children as a bedtime story."
4,Looks good but watch out for stability/compatibility issues.,"This card gave me no end of grief when I upgraded my motherboard. After much swearing and wasted time I discovered that the MB wasn't compatible with it. Make =sure= yours is before installing.That said, I hated to give it up, it looked so good and ran so smoothly. It's not cutting edge by any means--wasn't even really when it was first released--but price/performance-wise it can't be beat. (I replaced it with a TNT Ultra which never looked as good or, it seemed to me, ran as fast.)"
2,Installation can be rough,"I suppose this is an OK card for the money, but but beware if you're buying it to replace any other Voodoo-based card. Getting the thing to run correctly is a nightmare -- you'll probably need to fiddle with your registry and settings some. I think I'd rather change the manifold on my car than install another one of these things. Also, you won't notice dramatic improvement over a Voodoo 2. I'd probably take it back if I weren't so tired of dinking around with my machine. The only reason to get one is if you want one card for both 2D and 3D use -- at least you free up a PCI slot."
3,"Good card, but lacking somewhat","The V3 3K is a good card for the mainstream, budget gamer. However, if you are looking in this price range, I'd go with an nVidia Riva TNT2 Ultra--unless you really like to play nothing but old Glide games.If you're willing to spend the extra $$, go with either a GeForce2 GTS(64mb), GeForce256 DDR(I own one--very fast, though not quite as fast as the GTS previously mentioned), or a Voodoo5 5500."
2,An old card,"Tecnologically, this card is out of date. Spend your money for a new generation card. If you are one of those Voodoo fans, at least try the new series."
2,Too little too late,"Seriously outdated technology at this point. If you want to run really really old games fast, than buy it. If you want to play the latest games and have them look good, don't buy it. The image quality is terrible only 16-bit in a world where 32-bit has been standard for years. There is a big difference, your eyes will pay the penalty with ugly graphics."
2,V3 - hahah,"Tragical, not worty of any atention try nVidia Riva TNT2 Ultra and you'll see how a real grafics cart should look like. This ***** supports only 16 bit rendering, no real Open GL support, djasfgsd Direct X - you need a pach for everything, and finaly Glide who is long forgoten. Supports AGP in 1x mode. Only 16 mb of SD-Ram wich is not enough comparing to competition. Try to find some real results that show who is the boss in Grafics Card - Realy cool i can play Mario 2 in 100000000 fps.And Q3 in 3 if i get luky."
4,Suspicous reviews,"Somehow I find the other reviews suspicious in their intent. Either they are excellent or poor. In my opinion, the V3 holds its own with the other cards out there (including TNT2). It does support all the APIs, contrary to what another reviewer mentioned. But it does not support 32 bit color (although all others card on the market which support 32 bit color take a severe performance hit when used at that color depth). I think this card is an excellent value at the price listed."
4,thanks,Just what I was expecting …It was a very good service and on time. It’s good to have business with you.
1,I can't believe I spent money on this!,"I believed the hype and suffered accordingly! I took this product for the recommended 3 days, within 1 week I developed an extremely painful boil in a very sensitive area. This was the 1st time in my whole life that I had to deal with a boil and although I cannot prove the cause, it seems likely that it was due to the use of the 4Life Transfer Factor Classic product. At this point, I won't ever use this product for my dogs or myself. Save your money and do not buy this crap!"
5,4Life Transfer Factor,"A friend told me about this product, and that although it's expensive, Amazon has the best price, which I found to be true.After the start of a flu, I began taking Transfer Factor, and I wasonly sick 3 days. I think this product helped me get over the flufaster than I would have.It's something I always want to have in my medicine chest. It's also good for animals. I read a lot of information and reviews."
2,International shipped product is an issue,"I live in Thailand. And, after taking this product for 2 months, I begin to believe there is melamine in this products. I am not so sure but the products has been labeld in Thai language and may be they are not made in USA but in Mexico or China instead. Not recommend if you buy this outside USA or you better check your kidney functions frequently."
4,chopper,very good. I use it every day to chop my very old dogs' dinner. One is sixteen and one is fourteen and still going strong. It looks like Kitchenaid will out last them.
2,Short blade life,"I've used this product for the past three years, but infrequently. I would estimate I've used it 50 times, on small jobs. Now ready for the trash heap..blade is too dull to chop anything, even when I feed it very small pieces at a time. I tried sharpening blade with a knife sharpener, but still no chop. I should be able to find replacement blades, but I cannot find them, so need to now replace the entire unit. Disappointing."
1,Stopped worn down,"I got this to make baby food when my son was about 6 months old, I've only been able to use it a handfull of times because the mechanism that pivots when you close the lid has worn down, so it no longer pushes the button into the motor to make it work. I see no way to fix this, so now I am stuck with a $50 piece of garbage."
1,Grat price but not an investment,"I bought this form Target. It worked as advertised. However, after chopping up some garlic, some of the small garlic bits got into the handle through multiple holes in the design where the cover and the work bowl locks into place with the motor.There is no way to clean off the bits stuck in the handle once it gets in there.I'm planning on returning this unit."
2,Bad Button,"It's really too bad that the button is so poorly made. We've had this processor for a couple of years and we just loved it until the button suddenly stopped working. It's a shame since the rest of it worked great. Talk about frustrating--filling the bowl only to find that it wouldn't do a darned thing. So now I'm back to chopping by hand, in search of a food processor that's more durable."
2,Liked it when it worked,It was great the first two times I used it to make baby food. After the third use it stopped working. It was a baby shower gift so I could not return it having had it for a year.
5,Terrific product.,"I know that this product is advertised for diaper rash, but I used it on my mother's besore which healed in a couple of weeks. Wonderful product. I use a little big on the bedsore and cover it with a telfa pad and paper tape."
3,Volumes 1-7 are a much better choice - take your pick.,"This is a generally well assembled selection from the Hotel Costes series, however, it lacks the thoughful arrangement and mixing that make the series a true gem. The transitions between songs are clunky though not jarring, and rather uninspired - but then again - this is a best of compilation, so it's exactly what I expected. I suggest that anyone interested in this item pick one of the original seven volumes and enjoy... they're all excellent choices. The one major reason to buy this disc is for the ""exclusive"" Madonna remix unavailable elsewhere. If you're a Madonna fan like I am, Stephane's remix of ""What it Feels Like for a Girl"" is well worth the price of admission, however it feels like a marketing ploy (very well executed, mind you) to get an extra buck or two out of people that own the whole series already but want the Madonna track."
3,interesting choice...,"Stephane Pompougnac's (best of...) compilation of the Hotel Costes series has a few definite good choices on here (Adore, No Communication/No Love, London In The Rain) but some of the songs don't seem to qualify as 'the best', such as 'Clementine', 'Surrond me with your love' and 'S.O.S.' which are not that good (that's just my opinion) I say that 'IN BLACK OF NIGHT'(COSTES 6), 'PONGER STAR'(COSTES 5) and 'PLEASE DON'T LEAVE'(COSTES 7) should be on there instead of the other 3. Ah well... it still pretty good!"
4,Love the stylish chillout/lounge spirit,"This is the only CD of Hotel Costes I have, and I do like its spirit, although I do not like all of its songs. Every time I listen to it, I automatically image a Paris' bar with stylish and sexy men and women in a wealthy and cozy interior."
2,typical lame compliation,"Gotta wonder who puts these compilations together???Perhaps 3 cool songs. Do yourself a favor and buy Vol. 1, 3, 5, and 7 instead."
3,these CDs are variable,"I bought three Hotel Costas CD's. My favorite, by far, was Best of Hotel Costas."
2,Is not the Best of Costes at all,"I have most of the Hotel Costes cds and this cd is really bad. It is not a good selection of the other cds, very disappointed!!"
5,Worth the download!,"Entertaining and informative. Especially worthwhile for new expectant parents, but useful for veterans, too. NOTE: This reviews the actual content of the videos, and does not take into consideration any downloading problems, as other reviews do and end up skewing the ratings of the program."
5,"Compact, Precision, Competent","While I've only tried this reader with Sandisk SD, Viking SM and Lexar CF, I've experienced nothing more than complete satisfaction and ease of use. It's very convenient and well thought out. Couldn't ask for better."
4,It's nice to have an all in one reader,"Prior to purcashing this card reader, I was constantly swaping around card readers - it was a pain. This card reader makes my life much easier, especially since I have so many different memory sticks, 1 from my camera, 1from my palm pilot and yet another 1from my PSP handheld."
2,Doesn't work with new CF cards,"I have the RW-018 Rev.B model. I even upgraded the firmware from the www.lexarmedia.com website. However, it will not work with my two Sandisk Ultra II 512mb cards! This reader takes many minutes to write large multimegabyte files, and when reading back the file it is corrupted! Many others with the same problem have reported this problem, and so far there is no fix but to get another brand USB2 card reader. Too bad. I am very disappointed.(The reader works fine with my 25x Transcend 512mb card, which was made almost 2 years ago.)"
5,Great Multi-Format Digital Media Reader and WRITER!,"This is a great digital media reader and WRITER! I know it is advertised only as a reader, but I have used it to write several things to various mediums. And at [this price]... it's a GREAT DEAL, PLUS it's USB 2.0! Can't get any better than that. :-)"
1,Buy Sandisk Instead,"I recently received this as a Christmas gift, and it didn't work from the start. After much time wasted with their ""tech support"" the device was deemed defective. Their tech support is very poor - all they could say, ""try another Xd card"". The device kept freezing my system, the driver that came with the software didn't work, a very frustrating experience. If the tech support was more informative or supportive, Lexar might have redeemed itself. I recently purchased the Sandisk 5 in 1 reader and it works like a charm, right from the start. Their quick start guide is much more detailed, and their software works! Save yourself a headache and buy Sandisk."
4,Hack - open the case,"Lexar USB2.0 reader went from erratic to consistently dead. Playing with the software was annoying, it seems to crash Windows Explorer or Computer management very easily. Open the case (remove screw under label, pry open plastic), press on some parts, worked. Suspect L1 very near the USB connector. Anyway it seems to work pretty well without the case."
3,It worked for a year and then stopped,"It worked for a year and stopped working. The computer recognizes it, but the memory can't get recognized. I had to buy another reader."
3,Doesn't work with SDHC cards?,"I bought this reader back in 2004 or early 2005. It's been really good to me, I can't complain. However, we just bought a new camera that can use SDHC cards, and my trusty Lexar card reader won't read them."
1,Not compatible with WIndows 98SE; HELP not good!,"I bought this unit to work with WIndows 98SE as listed on Amazon; it does NOT! I contacted Lexar HELP and they sent a new driver file that would not load.The device would NOT show up as an added drive. My PC recognized the device when attached to the USB port but the driver software, after a declared ""succesful"" installation, was ""not found.""I do not recommend this device with WIndows 98SE!!!"
5,1 GB. downloaded in just 4 minutes!,I downloaded to my G5 a 1GB. 80x Lexar CompactFlash in just 4 minutes! SWEET!
5,for frustrated students,"I lived in Germany for two years as a child and attented a German school...but I never took a class on German grammer until now (college). Different verb forms especially had my brain in a knot. Fortunately this book was required for my German Lit class, and suddenly it's all begining to make sense. The book is laid out in chapters(verbs, adjective endings, passive voice, ect.) and each chapter is further divided into levels (I, II, III) according to your experience with German. Start with level I verbs and work your way up, or skip right to the more advanced levels if you are so inclined. The current book also features skill-building excercised at the end of each level. The answers can be found online.All in all, I found this book to be readable and well-laid out. (Take a highlighter to it if you need to!)"
4,great service,quick delivery and good product. I ordered a used book and it was in excellent condition. reached my expectations
2,This is really a 128MB x 2 memory stick,"Don't be fooled by the picture. Even though the ""128x2"" logo is not shown, this is really a Memory Stick that has 2 partitions of 128MB. You have to flip a little switch to go between the 2 partitions. To get a true 256MB Memory Stick with contiguous memory, you'll need to look at the ""Memory Stick Pro"" models."
4,An author as quirky as his characters,"I had the privilege of attending a writer's conference in Indiana where the author was an instructor. He was the kind of person one wants to observe, to be around. Funny, smart, very gentlemanly toward his wife and the attendees! His stories in this book reflect Mr. Gautreaux's innate ability to observe people of all sorts. His is a rare talent. Highly recommend this book to readers to enjoy all fiction, especially Southern fiction."
5,Depth charges for the soul. Best stories I've read in years.,"The only way I could tell you what these stories are ""like"" would be to hand you the book and say, ""Go read some."" Only the words of the stories, themselves, can communicate their content--which, come to think of it, is a good definition of successful new art. To label these stories would just spoil your pleasure in discovering them.Better for me simply to tell you that a person like me loved them, and is rushing to get Tim Gautreaux's other books. And who is a person like me?--a busy, successful, perceptive, cynical, and creative scientist who dislikes both manipulative sentimentality and self-referential academic rhetoric. I generally prefer history or Richard Dawkins to fiction. When I need an escape, I read Rex Stout (Nero Wolfe). Now I'm going to read Tim Gautreaux, who is an escape into reality."
3,worked great,got what i paid for and worked great for the application i was using it for. not very stiff and have to play with a little to get the to secure.
5,Excellent golf hat or for general sun protection.,"Quick delivery, great price, good fit. I was not used to wearing a hat with a brim; always wore a golf cap. I needed a hat for sun protection and I get great complements when I wear this hat at golf."
5,great american made hat,"Do you hate having the sun beat down on you, and then sweating buckets because your hat doesn't let your head vent? I do, and in the summer spend a good amount of time outside and on the water where the sun's rays really start to cook you. I can also vouch the the keeper strap will keep your hat with you and not floating away somewhere.This hat is crushable, breathable and after 1 years use, looks as good as the day it arrived. Plus this is a quality product made here in the U.S. of A."
5,Great Hat,"I bought one of these last spring for outdoor work (I'm in construction), and this hat has held up to constant use. It's breathable, washable, crushable, and always comes out looking good. I've really ran mine through the ringer, and have only good things to say. Mine is still in good shape and am about to buy one for my father for his birthday."
2,Henschel has lost all quality control.,"I have owned a Henschel Breezer for 5 years. I love it but with a caveat that they are correct when they claim it is ""crushable"" but then again so is my Irish crystal - and neither return to their original shape. But now the sizes have changed. My large always fit like a glove, the new one in large arrived packed very nicely in a big box but the hat was huge on me. I returned it for a medium. It arrive in a very small box ""Pre-Crushed"" if you will. I would have returned it for that reason alone but it was so small that it hurt to force it on my head. Not happy with Henschel ""quality control"" or the shipper's packing. I will continue my hunt for this style hat elsewhere."
4,I like the hat.,"The hat is good looking but the fit is a little weird, the first hat that I order was a large when I put it on it was to small so I return it and got a X-large and it was to big so need less to say I kept the X-large one."
4,Nice Hat,You can't beat Henschel for well made and reasonably priced headgear. I have two of their breezer hats I wear for sun protection and both are great.
4,A Real Nice Hat,"Keeping sun off my face in tropical locations has become a priority. The wide brim does just that, while the mesh sides keep your head well ventilated, which reduces sweating considerably. The chin-string is a necessity for river travel by speedboat. For the price, this is a real nice hat. One thing though, it looks much better after some wear when a little dirty and slightly shabby, a condition which also eliminates the ""new hat, eh"" comments when relaxing at the end of a 40 degree Celsius day with fellow ex-pats."
2,henshel hat,I have several Henshel hats so I had no question of what size to order. The hat was a full size larger than the same size I already have and so the return would have been expensive. I gave the hat away of course. Henshel has a quality control issue. I won't order any more Henshel hats.
3,hats,"These hats are okay, but I was disappointed there was no sweat shield in front like the hat I had before. I do not remember the brand of that hat,but it looked identical to these hats. Also, I washed that hat once, and it came out good. I washed one of these hats and it looked terrible, so I threw it out."
4,Purchase Review,I was very pleased with the purchase of this hat. I brought it as a gift for a friend and he loved it. The quality of the material and construction is superb. Well worth the money. The seller was very professional and shipped quickly!!
5,Just the right hat,"This hat is perfect for sun protection in a windy situation. It will also keep my head cool in warmer weather. I am pleased with how it looks, and that it is packable."
2,"Its OK, but there must be better","Frankly, I was disappointed. The book does not come anywhere close to providing enough info to restore a Model A. If you are a beginner, it falls way short; if you are experienced, its too basic. Photos are black and white. I didn't return the book only because I though some of the info might augment books I already own. Save your money. If you are looking for a book to help with repairs, the Model A Ford Mechanics Handbook (Volume I) by Les Andrews is tops.Model A Ford mechanics handbook"
4,The synopsis does not do this book justice.,"The synopsis of this book is very dry and cold, and does not do justice to the warmth and depth of Moffett's skillful writing. This is more than just an environmental cautionary tale -- it is a tender character study, and a home for some extremely interesting, quirky inhabitants. Definitely worth a read if this type of thing appeals to you, whether you are a fan of SF or not. A shame that this is currently out of print. I hope that changes soon."
3,Manuel Barrueco and Leo Brower,"Tecnicamente Barrueco es impecable pero me decepciona la interpretacion de ""Danza del Altiplano"" y ""Danza Paraguaya"". Creo que hay mejores interpretes de Barrios y Brower que el. Carlevaro por ejemplo interpreta Brower mucho mejor que Barrueco en mi opinion. Sin emargo el Preludio de ""La Catedral"" (De Barrios,curiosamente) sencillamente lo borda. Es magnifico de la manera que lo hace. Quizas habria que preguntarle porque las dos anteriores piezas las entiende de esa forma..."
1,"I haven't seen it yet, i lose my money","This is a cd i bought, and it was send for regular mail from US to Mexico.... i haven't seen it yet.... it got lost on the mail and i could not track it even when i wanted to, if i would have the option i would pay for a better mail, but there was not such an option. So i lose my money, i don't have the cd."
4,Pretty good deal.,"I agree with the reviewers who feel these Lexars are not made to withstand very rough treatment, but they're not all that flimsy either. I find them absolutely wonderful for transporting documents from home to work. We've also use them to copy albums of digital pictures and of course to share (fully licensed) MP3s.However, both the 64 & the 128 meg models are not USB 2.0 enabled, so the speed needed to make the latter two tasks really easy with these models is not available. I'd suggest buying either this 64 meg model for text applications or going to the 256 meg model for pics or music files."
5,Wonderful Documentry!,See how Jesus Christ FREED a church fromtheir false unbiblical doctrines andteachings; also from the late Herbert W. Armstrong.
1,A story full of myths and propaganda,"As an ex-member of the Worldwide Church of God cult (who changed their name to Grace Communion International in 2009), I would have to say that the only ""miracle"" that came out of WCG's ""transformation"" is the fact that thousands of other members such as myself, were freed from the stronghold of the cult, and have wanted nothing to do with that denomination ever since! For a more accurate assessment of WCG's transformation story, see the ""Exit & Support"" Website (google it)."
4,Great with a few simple flaws,"First off K&N; does not list compatability with the 2007 Cobalt SS/SC, however all three years of the car's production (05-07) use an identical intake system and it will fit the 07 model. The car gets a high RPM whine with a noticable increase in low RPM boost. Likely due to the removal of the restrictive bends in the stock intake.A common problem with aftermarket intakes is a Check Engine light (for too much air entering the system as would be the case with a leak in teh stock system) which i have NOT experenced. K&N; has changed the initial design of this intake and chances are they corrected the airflow readings of the mass air sensor keeping them within spec.The lack of 5 stars comes form a VERY tight install. It can be a rather large pain however with a little work it will fit and is one of the best constructed/clean looking intakes I've seen for the car."
3,It works well enough.,"It provides enough protection for my harp for easy trips (around town in the back of my vehicle). Be sure to use the shoulder strap to carry your harp at all times - the plastic handle broke within the first 2 minutes of using it. I think it's only meant to assist in ""steering"" the harp around corners, etc."
2,Very poor,This book is not worth the money. I was expecting so much more but is all-in-all disappointing. The quality of the photos is terrible and the maps are useless. For Portugal I cannot understand how is it possible that the only Portuguese national park (Peneda-Gers) is not included.
3,We do it orka! ADRIAN,"Adrian from MUSKOGEE OKLAHOMA shut your mouth and keep my name out of it. First of all you don't Know me, you got a girls name, and what would someone like U from Bug Tussle Oklahoma know about gansta rap anyway! Where is Muskogee Oklahoma anyway? Some little boon hick town nobody even knows is there. I was given rich the factor props fool. The only hater on here is you Adrian from Bug tussle Oklahoma. Only haters are concerned about what the next man says or does. So if ain't nobody said anything about you from jump keep the next mans name out yo mouth u digg!"
4,"It was good, but not as good as the first two","While I love learning about history while I read, there seemed to be a lot more history in this book that sometimes I lost the story. I wanted to know more about what drove Jacob and Esau, there had to be a reason behind their rivalry, but I don't know what it is. When Esau visited Jacob in prison there was a perfect opportunity to provide a back story but it was never done satisfactorily.The story and history about our split from England was well laid out, but I have come to know the Morgan family well and wanted to read more about them than the various historical figures that were in the novel.However, I love the book and will keep it as a part of my personal library to reread in the future."
2,Apalling,"Although I give the book two stars because some of the information in it may be helpful, the editing of the book was a dismal failure. It lowered my confidence in the book drastically to observe how many times a word was spelled incorrectly or used in the wrong context."
3,Was not what I expected,I expected this to have more humor. I am not one that care for dry humor and to me this was dry humor.
1,disappointed,"I really expected this to be funny from an interview i saw her on. But maybe it was the hometown live show that took away from it. I resold it back to amazon, and this is not the norm for me with stand up comics"
3,aimed at elementary/middle school teachers!,"I found most of the ideas rather babyish for my pupils (aged 11-16)! Some of the lesson ideas were interesting, as were some of the suggestions in ""bag of tricks"". However, I'm afraid letters to parents before the school year reading ""I'm so excited to have your child in my class this year. I feel confident that we will have a terrific year, full of learning and fun"" would probably be seen as rather 'over the top' and possibly sarcastic over here in Britain!"
5,Cool I guess,"I haven't really read too much of the book, but from what I have read, it's interesting. I loved the actual book. The physical condition was on the older side (which I had no problem with at all; in fact, I like my books a little older). It was inexpensive and is a nice addition to my book collection."
3,Not as good as O lucky man,"This album is known as Price's masterpiece - but I think that label should be applied to O Lucky Man. Those who love the O Lucky Man soundtrack won't find much of the rock n roll on this album.I'd recommend it to Alan Price fans, as there are some good tracks. But the music hall numbers may put off non-Price fans. As well as the slow quiet tunes. Overall it's a bit of a mixed bag."
2,Bucket is good but the shovel is next to useless,"I purchased these as a giveaway for my son's ""dirt-day"" party. the buckets were great but the shovels are so flat that it is more difficult to dig with compared to other plastic shovels."
4,HTML 4 of 6,"One month ago I knew nothing of HTML and now have a fully functioning site with forms, tables, frames, graphics etc. However, this book was a fun easy read up until the scripting and Dynamic HTML sections where it seems to fall short. The examples of the style sheets, and scripting for the MOST part generated errors or didn't work (IE4, Netscape 3 and 4) if copied exactly which is frustrating and there are dozens of typos in the examples throughout the book which would not create the desired result of course. I don't know how I could read and type for 150 pages or so of, ""Error in line 15...."". Fortunately the nature of HTML is easy enough so that most could probably catch some obvious errors (like leaving closing tags off). Unfortunately, I'm shopping now for a good scripting book. The organization was a little questionable at times: you will create Virtual Reality before you change the background colors of your page. Overall, I recommend it as a great way to start HTML."
2,Edible,"I tried out a bunch of the LaBriute (Amazon misspelled the name!) self heating meals. The Spaghette & Meatballs one was the first I tried, and is reasonably good.The Honolulu nuggets are... umm... edible. Probably great for long-term wilderness survival: you take a look at the box, and think ""you know, I'm not that hungry. I can go for a bit more..."" Dieters might enjoy this too..."
4,Great album!,"I was impressed by the new style brought by the World Wide Message Tribe (WWMT). The songs that impressed me were Heatseeker and Hypocrite. They were totally a different style than what I was used to them being. These songs would probably be categorized as Techno-core and all of the others, Dance-Techno. I would compare them to Raze and, well, Raze. They sound very similar. I love the sound in most of these songs, but some of them are too mellow. I absolutely can't wait until ""Frantik"" comes out. Keep in mind that they are extremly talented and they are not afraid to sing to Jesus."
5,I like the others better,"I love house music, and specificly dancing in the presence of God This new album makes it difficult. So I can actually use some suggestions on more house. A little diappointed."
4,If you don't have a good system... don't buy it...,"You have to have a good system to be able to appreciate this CD. The highs kick, the bass rox, and this CD has a variety of everything. Great mix to thump to goin' down the road or to get a party hoppin'..."
1,I'm sure there were some words there....,"Although this makes a welcome change from ""praise him on the triangle"" and I think their motivation and dynamicism is laudable, I find that the so-called biblical content difficult to discern and music a bit second rate - could they perhaps be concentrating too much on the media rather than the message? Moby is better by far, so why not listen to that instead (or perhaps ""accordian praise"" (jk))? A road may be long, but it has two ends. In short not all that good."
2,Playing too fast,The radio producer had every band playing way too fast in comparison to their record as a way to generate additional excitement. The only performance that is paced well is Elvis -- where he reprises his song at a slow pace.
2,Does not work well with Mac OS X,"Excited to jump from a 1GB Microdrive (which a lot of people bag) I bought the 1GB Lexar 32X WA.When the box came, you have to special order the JumpSHOT card reader (which came for free).While the CF card is in the camera it seems to operate slower than the 1GB Microdrive. Slower burst of pictures.Secondly, to read the pictures, the camera must be plugged in to the computer. The JumpSHOT reader is not compatible with Mac OS 10.2.6. Drive does not even show up.The Microdrive was flawless from my experience with it. Waiting to hear back from the Lexar Tech Support about the issues mentioned above."
2,"Not as ""Fast"" as I expected....","I bought this card for for use in a NIkon D100 with the latest firmware, and I have to say 32x and WA seem like marketing terms. As soon as I shot with this card I didn't notice any speed difference so I did my own ""real world test"". All situations were identical. I used this Lexar card & a Delkin efilm card with no speed rating on the label. In raw mode- Delkin 38 secs, with the lexar 38 secs- in Tiff L Delkin 33 secs, Lexar 28 secs. In JPEG L Delkin 4 secs, Lexar 3 secs.The Jump shot is only compatible with USB enabled Lexar cards. Great transfer rate to computer though. I had no problems with the image rescue software using OS X 10.2.6. Good warranty.However, wished I bought the Viking 1gb card and saved myself 70.00 dollars. This may be labeled professional, but come on...its flash card."
5,An excellent foray into the near future,"This book is a handy guide to issues that will be affecting us in the near future - a great read written in a witty, charismatic style. The authors present the material with clarity which kept me interested from start to finish. A practical guide for those who want to know where the future is going to lead us - in life, love and business. The book provides something that just about everyone can grasp on to - pertinent and relevant information that can help make sense of a changing planet!"
3,Vivid broadstrokes of a Western-centric future,"I find the book a pleasure and a quick read. It is almost like taking a car ride through various scenaries and countries. You get a sense of a larger picture of a possible future, but yet you yearn for the slow walk when you can really see the details. A major gripe would be that, despite pages on Asia, it is still a Western, especially US-centric, future that is being painted. And the Asian section reads like a current affairs report. Interestingly though, what the authors failed to pick up is that the section on Europe holds many parallels for Asia. In summation, NEXT is good for triggering other thoughts and ideas. Not so great if you want to drill down into the whys and wherefores."
3,"Non-fattening, slightly nutritious (con)fusion food","The law of averages says if you make enough predictions, some will end up being right. And there are plenty in Next. Trouble is, the authors want it all ways, with futuring AND global sociology lite AND armchair marketing for theorists who don't have to sell anything.The scope is broad and ambitious, the tone wobbles between authoritative, chatty and breathless. There's evidence of real knowledge, thinking and analysis here and there, but all too often the authors dip into their grab bag of random examples. Trick or treat? The USA Today style statistics are supposed to lend weight but end up showing just how spurious percentages can be.A handy book for the bathroom shelf. Mind bites for the board members who want to look well informed but nothing much for management to get their teeth into."
1,tell me how to read,i haven't read your bok yet. i want to read some chapters of your book online. please suggest how to do that.
4,Great sign but may not be what you want,"This sign is exactly what I was looking for in a giants street sign. However, this is because I WAS NOT LOOKING FOR ONE THAT'S SPECIFICALLY METAL. needless to say this is a tough foam, plastic mix, not metal. It is durable but for those who are looking for a classic metal or tin street sign, I say turn onto a different street; this is not what you are looking for."
3,A change of life,"Chateaubriand writes the biography of Abbe Rancé, the founder of the Order of the Trapenses, the hardest and most rigid of all monastical orders. The biography is true to Chateaubriand's status as a full Romantic. During his first 37 years, Rancé lived like the aristocrat he was, in the life of the Court, pleasure and moral dissolution. But suddenly, like Francis of Assisi or Saint Augustine, Rancé's eyes were open and he realized how hollow and senseless his life was. As it usually happens with sudden moral shocks, Rancé took his to an extreme. He retired to the mountains, to spend his last 37 years in monastical life, like an eremite. The order he founded had the usual votes of obedience, poverty and chastity, plus a vote of silence. The focus of the book is on the moral fight that took Rancé to such a hard transformation."
3,Presents a significant understanding of Afghani factions,"This 1991 work is severely out of date, of course. However, it is interesting primarily because it is the work of Zalmay Khalizad. An old and prominent hand at RAND, he plays a prominent role on Bush's NSC. He is also Afghan, and personally knows the most significant players in Afghanistan's politics, both dead and alive. Consequently, this book is useful for understanding the Bush Administration's understanding of Afghanistan's politics, perceiving its hopes and udnerstandings for Afghanistan's future, as well as the perceptions and attitudes of a significant policy player in the current conflict."
1,Didn't Last Long....,"I bought the Lexar Media 128MB flash drive. It was the first one that I had bought. It was really great at first; no more floppy drives, convienient storage (my keychain). I babied it pretty well, but after a month-and-a-half it died on me. I always removed it from my system properly. Im very wary of flash drives at this point... I'm going to try another brand and buy one. If my next one fails I guess I'll have to stick to my floppy drive..."
2,my jumpdrive died without any reason,I thought that this jumpdrive was my best buy ever made until one day (without any reason!) it just didnt work ans lost all my critical info.
2,"Cheap, bulky, and quirky","I bought my lexar jumprdrive in a store. At the time, it seemed like a real bargain. However, you do get what you pay for and this product shows it. The bulky design makes using it on traditional towers painful if not impossible. Also, the device begins to slowly die within two months. My adivce is to either buy Lexar's 256 MB jumpdrive (which has given me no problem) or another, slimmer brand."
1,OEM 7026A Ignition Module,even thoughyour system said it was the correct part for my vehical. When it arrived it was the wrong part.
3,"Read ""Soldier of the Great War""","Having read ""Soldier of the Great War"", I was disappointed in this novel. ""Soldier"" was superb! I found myself suspecting that this was an earlier work, perhaps his first novel (which it is). It is broad in scope and bold in vision, but too often the use of language is pretentious and obscure. There is some excellent writing, which previews what is to come in ""Soldier"". But ""Refiner's Fire"" lacks the control and the consistent elegance that I had expected and which one finds in his later work. This book is an interesting read for one who enjoys observing the development and maturation of a great writer."
3,disappointing compared to his other novels,"Granted, it must be impossible to live up to the reputation once you have already produced a series of masterful novels. I think Helprin is one of the very finest 20th century writers in English. A Winter's Tale and A Soldier of the Great War (and Antproof) are some of the finest pieces of fiction ever written. I have to admit that I found The Refiner's Fire much weaker than his other books, but I'm still glad I read it. It's heartening to know that even true geniuses have trouble maintaining this level of achievement 100% of the time. Still worth reading for serious Helprin fans."
2,"Read ""Soldier of the Great War""","I've read all of his books now and I think this is the weakest of his novels. Read ""A Soldier of the Great War."""
1,ugh,Not at all good-- like a 384 pages of J. Peterman catalog copy.As soon as I finished it I was mad at myself for wasting so much time reading it.
2,Worst custome ever bought,"As some else reviewed, the tutu started to come off after the first wash. and every day my daughter wore this dress, the tutu kept riping off. I had to sow back the tutu myself.Don't buy it, it is too expensive for the quality you are getting. Look for other options."
3,"Nice, but cheap","This is ballerina costume is really fairly cheap. The tutu started coming off on the first day my daughter wore it, which I felt was kind of pathetic, but at the same time we didn't even really like the tutu that came on the costume so we ended up getting a different one that she wears over it. So, it is nice and pretty but the tutu and the shoes are not built for repeated use, they are made for one or two times use at the most before they start falling apart. The rest of the costume is nice, the headband and the leotard, but you may want to go for something a little more expensive if you want a whole costume that will last."
5,Great family entertainment!,"We first heard this story when my children were very young. They loved it so much that we listened to it over and over. Every once in awhile I'd overhear them retelling parts of it, or shouting out ""Raspberries!"" as Jay does on the tape. It is a truly wonderful, magical, captivating story, which I am now ordering for my nieces and nephews."
3,Not the same Govinda,"Despite what the other reviewers seem to believe, this is not an album by Austin's Shane O'Madden - the Govinda of ""O Earthly Gods,"" ""Entwined and Entranced,"" and ""Erotic Rhythms from Earth."" I've tried to find out who it is, but have not been able to do so. Sorry. But it isn't O'Madden."
3,Good lamps...bad brackets!,"I have had these lights for about 4 years now and use them a lot for night time highway driving. They can hardly be beat for their brightness and range. I really like them. However, I have the same complaint as the other reviewer in that the mounting brackets are pretty cheap, have broken on me and were very hard to adjust since they kind of swivel around on you as you're trying to dial them in. I've ended up making my own metal brackets to mount them with. Not real pretty, but they work now and don't move or vibrate on me like the Hella ones did. Hella really should be embarrassed at what they put their name out on with this mounting system. They need to come up with a better mounting bracket system. Other than that they're great. If I hadn't been able to come up with a good mounting system on my own I'm afraid that they would have been a big waste of some good money."
3,"Great light, lousy mounting system","I bought a single lamp to replace one that had the plastic mount fail from vibration after about a year. Lights are above average in uniformity and intensity of light but the ""all angle"" mounting is extremely iffy on getting dialed in and even more difficult to tighten without overstressing the plastic--which in this case is exactly what I did. For almost 30 bucks more per light you can buy a metal mounting bracket but...folks, Hella should just do it right and include the bracket which is worth maybe 6 or 7 bucks. I'll be more careful snugging this one down but if it fails, I'll go to different lights next time."
3,Not as nice as other calendars,"I had bought LOTR Calendars before, and most were not as 'dark' as this one. While the photos from the movies are nice, they really don't excite me as some of the artwork from by-gone calendars did. Other calendars also had LOTR dates included, while this one did not. Still a nice find, tho I will probably not buy another calendar published in this style."
1,Doesn't Fit,The card shoe I received was clearly marked 8 decks. It is the same size as the one I already have which was marked 6 decks. It does not work very well at all. In order to get 8 decks in you have to force them in and the shoe does not operate properly at all.
4,Evil!,"While maybe not as pulverizingly and brutally appealing as their masterpiece, Severe Exposure, 6 Finger Satellite still manage to add new tricks to their already bizarre and wacky sound on Law of Ruins. While many tracks are a triumphant return to the spastic and abrasive guitar workouts that were left largely behind on Paranormalized, there are also many spacious synth grooves here, where 6FS allow their already harrowing and claustrophobic noise to grow to mesmeric dimensions. For example, Fall to Pieces is 7 minutes of droning drums and bleeping synth noises. Elsewhere, however, the trademark 6FS tweaked-synth + motoric drums + guitar-as-white-noise blueprint is in full effect. As always, 6FS prove themselves to be tireless inventors. Complete lunacy has never been so interesting or so tongue-in-cheek."
4,Good,"I like the Marx Brothers more for their comedy, but this album is pretty good. My only real complaint was that it was a little bit short. Overall though, this is a must have for Marx Bros. fans."
1,Not as advertised !,"Please note: the specs on the camera here show it as having a USB output. NOT TRUE ! Per tech support at Vivitar, this is an error in the camera instruction booklet & on Amazon.com product specifications. Only has serial output & no info available on the A/C adaptor also discussed in the instruction booklet. Why pay $$$$$for a digital camera with a high megapixel, but few other features & downloads by serial only??? There are more choices out there with better features for even less money....I'd advise anyone to shop around....Better is available!"
4,It's a blast!,"I bought this camera, my first digital, with the rationale that it would pay for itself with pictures of items to sell on eBay. That may still happen, but, despite the low resolution, I find myself leaving the Nikons at home and using this for all my snapshots. It has all the minimal essential features, including the LCD display, flash and CompactFlash storage. When I upgraded to Windows XP the camera driver was no longer compatible so I bought a USB card reader ... . This has been much more convenient than uploading directly from the camera. I just plugged it in, XP recognized it and installed the driver almost immediately, and now it's like I have another hard drive whenever I plug it in. I just drag and drop the files, and delete them from the card. I'm sure there are better cameras out there but for the price this will be all I need for some time. It's easy to use and intuitive."
3,vivitar camera 3500,"I love this digital camera,BUT I just upgraded to windows xp and it is not compatible to the software with this camera....I have asked everywhere to find the software i need,,PLEASE can anyone help????Thank YouTwain drive is what i think i need for the 3500 vivtar camera,,DC 1500"
2,...,"The production on this album is best suitable for raw black metal bands, mainly because it helps them enhance an atmosphere. Yes, it is primal and unpolished, but it doesn't work to Final Dawn's advantage. While it doesn't totally eclipse the intruments, it really keeps them from shining beneath a black cloud of mediocrity. Which is the other problem. The guitar playing should be able to carry the weight of a song, but the playing here is just below average. None of the riffs seem to leave an impression. As a result, the songs achieve zero memorability. The monotonous vocals do not help their cause either. There's a degree of technicality in the music, but it feels incoherent and at times unlistenable. If the band worked more in composing songs with perhaps a little catchiness or at least some interesting riffs, then they may be able to stand out more among a sea of unoriginal black/death bands. But as it is now, this record needed some more rehearsing and several shots of adrenaline."
4,Good Quality at a Great Price,"Though this is not the best digital camera on the market it is on of the best deals. I have a number of digital cameras and this one is among my favorites. The quality of the photos is above average, much better than traditional film, and the price makes it a great choice for first timers. I recommend this camera to any first time digital buyer and also to any experienced digital user."
2,Great beginner camera,This camera is great for the beginner who is just starting to go Hi-tech.The pros are that the camera is lightweight and compact to carry anywhere. The upload speed from the camera to pc is not that long and the software that you can edit from is pretty useful as well.The cons are simply the camera is not advanced enough to shoot anything that moves. My friend and I sat as still as humanly possible and all we got back was a blurred image of where we think our heads should have been. Also the color is not as good as I had hoped and the lag time between taking pictures seems to be forever. Some instructions in the booklet are a bit vague and took some creative juices to get the camera properly set up.All in all if you are just shooting stuff for an auction site and color clarity isn't important grab this camera. Also this could be good for kids to mess around with if bought used.
1,Don't buy this camera.,I wish I had bought instant lottery tickets with the money I spent on this camera. It takes horrible photos and takes a long time to do so. I would sell it if it wouldn't give me tremendous guilt. I think I'll throw it off of something very tall.
1,do not buy this product if you expect any customer service,"I bought the camera three weeks ago and it was fine, i know have a problem with it, it comes on but will not do anything.it acts like a computer that has locked up, after 9 calls later someone finally called me back from vivitar and explained to me that they could fix it for $80.?.? i asked about the warranty and they continued with the plastic case was under warranty...Help"
2,Battery Eater,"This is an okay camera for your first one, but it is a battery eater!.. After about 20 pictures with flash, you need to change the batteries. Maybe I am naive but come on! Also...the flash stinks. You need there to be a LOT of light in the room to even make out an object and this is WITH the flash. Without it is just as bad."

1,Virtual hot pincers speak volumes,"It seems only to have occurred to a few of these reviewers that whatever Foucault intended as the poltical upshot of Discipline and Punish (and are we even 'allowed' to ask such a question?) its practical political effect has been to allow senior academics a face-saving way to warn graduate students not to rock the boat while denying any authoritarian tendencies. Perhpas Foucault's work has somehow had more positive political effects in gay rights work, and I would be interested in hearing that argument, but I doubt it. I think his celebrity has done that."
5,"Knowledge, power, and domination","By examining the rise of prison systems in Western culture, Foucault demonstrates the ways modern nation-states exert their power to dominate their citizens. This is a great book for anyone interested in power formations as well as continental theory."
5,Bookbyte Product,"I received ""Discipline and Punish"" in a very short amount of time! Looking over the book I have to say it is in great condition. Based on this experience with Bookbyte, I would recommend buying books through them!Discipline & Punish: The Birth of the Prison"
2,"OK, but pretentious like his other work","A few chapters are interesting because they bring back the gruesome spectacle of publc torture. So, if you're a sadist, and to some extent we all are (by watching horror flicks like Saw, etc.), you will dig how he introduces his power-knowledge theme and applies it to punishment today and yesterday.His writing itself is filled with run-on sentences, albeit with the overused semicolons and colons. And his paragraphs are too long. Did he skip language/writing classes? Foucault's terms are seldom defined adequately, if at all, and he is hard to follow. It's hard to see how this gives any value to his books. It takes a lot away in my opinion, perhaps masking the bleakness of some of his work."
1,Mornign Star Quilt,"Seller was quick and efficient. However, this quilt pattern is also in Quilt Through the Seasons, also by Eleanor Burns, which gives you many patterns for not much more money."
1,incorrect picture or name?,"I would like to buy this ""tea"" canister, as the photo shows, but the description says it's the ""salt"" canister. Which would I get if i make this purchase???"
5,Mallory Aluminum Snow Brush,This was a great present for my friend's new car! The bristles are not too rough so you don't have to worry about scratching the clear finish on the car. The handle is very long (3 ft) as described and it is light weight aluminum. I live in the North East. We get heavy wet snows. This brush is perfect because it gives you extension (cleaning roof and windshield) and it is metal which means you don't have to worry about the brush breaking when moving heavy wet snow. The window Ice scraper has a nice grip and the tool is lightweight. Again great because you get tired moving heavy wet snow! Will buy for friends in the future!
2,The grip slips,"The long reach is nice and the brush and scraper are in fine condition. However, the grip for the hand rotates and does not stay in place which essentially makes the handle grip useless. Would not buy again."
3,something has changed,"I had one of these for years and loved it, but gave it to a friend when I sold my car. I ordered a new one with a new car to battle the Chicago winter. Well, it's still awesome in terms of reach, the brush is still amazing, it gets the ice off nicely, but something is different about the handle. My old one felt really solid and sturdy. This one feels very light. Some may like that, but I find myself skidding off the windshield when scraping the snow / ice off due to lack of ""heft."" Also the grip feels much cheaper and I'm afraid it won't hold up through the abuse like my old one did. Still a nice brush though."
3,Functional,"Not as I was expecting it would be but it's very functional. It gets the job done but I guess, I was hoping for something else, great product though."
1,crap on a recorder,"What a piece of crap. Save your money. It's an insult to Vivaldi, Corelli, the other composers played on this and music lovers everywhere. If you love Baroque music look elsewhere. If you like circuses and carnivals with aberrations then buy this but in no way think that this is an honest interpretation of the composers represented. What a waste of talent and technique as well. Pure sensationalism with the usual life span I'm sure. Here today and gone tomorrow. What will they tackle next; Wagner's Ring?"
3,Tracklisting,"Project of members of Add N To (X), Hairy Butter and Stereolab - Anne Shenton, Barry 7, Steve Claydon, Richard Thomas, Jon Tye, Tim Gane and Andy Ramsay.

1,"No, I'm not alone.","The general public also ignores Essra Mohawk, who just refuses to go away. She's like the roaches in my apartment. I spray all the Raid I have but they still come back. 30 years ago she was a Laura Nyro imitator. In the 1970's she ripped off everyone from Leon Russell to Etta James to Donna Summer (that awful howling/shrieking quasi disco album she did with the coked out flower photograph on the cover). In the mousse haired 80's it was the synthetic new wave and Cyndi Lauper sound. The 90's she tried to ride the country linedancing haycart, and now it's blues. Damn, doesn't this woman have a style of her own? Given, her voice isn't bad but it has deteriorated badly after so many years and it not near the several octave soprano of yore. If you like this style of music you're much better off buying the latest releases by Tracy Nelson and Maria Muldaur. At least those women have their hearts in the blues and not just their wallets."
3,great convection oven..not so good toaster,I received this as cristmas present last year. It's great for cooking small meals. Cooks evenly a quickly but the toaster takes forever. This year I am asking for a toaster.
1,Dont' buy this!!!!,"I purchased this toaster oven because I wanted a good size ""second oven"" to do small entrees, frozen foods. First, the bottom heating element never fully heated so I had to raise the temp. I returned the unit same problem. O.K., I can deal with that. Now four month later, the door doesn,t close all the way. I wouldn't buy anything from Euro Pro again"
1,Broke After Several Uses,"I received this toaster oven as a gift less than six months ago. I've used it only a handful of times. As of a few days ago, the door refuses to close completely. I now have a one-inch gap to let all the heat out into the kitchen when I use it. Thanks, Euro-Pro: now I know never to buy your products if I have a choice."
2,very noisy,"The convection fan in the oven is very noisy until the oven is heated up, which seems to take forever. It says you can toast numerous slices of bread at once using the two racks but the top rack of toast is done way before the bottom rack so it's obviously not heating evenly.If I hadn't received it as a gift, I would have returned it."
1,Dont waste your money,"The looks of the Euro-pro To176 are sleek and the surfaces easy to clean. The door seals nicely and the knobs smooth. However, this is the most worthless kitchen appliance I've ever owned. I replaced an convection oven that had digital controls that stopped working, with this Euro-pro model. This one has more room, but a slower fan. On top of that, everything must be cooked on the highest temperature setting and it more than doubles cook time. 35 minutes for a frozen pizza, put small tray of lasagna in for an hour and the center was still frozen. Save your money and go else where."
2,"Poor as a Toaster, Gets too hot, otherwise fine oven","We recently purchased this oven/toaster because of its dual rack and convection features. We returned it about week later. We don't want to have both a toaster oven AND a separate toaster, that's why we bought a TOASTER OVEN. We owned a small black and decker toaster oven for 8 years and it performed both functions very well. The Europro unit toasts the bottom side more than the top side every time, plus it takes forever to toast and drys out the bread as others have stated. In addition the top and sides of the unit get VERY hot when baking or toasting during normal functionality. You have to be VERY careful about leaving anything next to it when baking or toasting. We never had these issues with the other unit we had.We are going back to Black and Decker which toasted evenly, never got too hot on the outside and performed all functions well enough for 8 years."
2,noisy with uneven toasting - then it broke,"I've had this toaster for about 3 months. I agree with the other complaints about noisy fans, uneven toasting, and difficulty adjusting the wind-up timer (too little, and it won't turn on -- too much and you burn the toast). Finally, about 3 months after purchasing this, the wind-up timer broke, so that the timer always springs to the ""always on"" position."
2,wasted my money on this toaster oven,"This toaster oven has been a disappointment. We got it not too long ago and one of the burners in the front already burned out and the broil pan is so hard to put in and take out. Also the toaster doesn't seem to work. The burners don't come on....it's definitely not user friendly. I've tried broil and the same thing happens, shouldn't the burner on top come on like an oven?! It seems to take forever for me to cook my sons french fries and other foods. You know how toddlers can't wait!!!"
3,I think I really wanted a toaster,"This oven is fine and all, but I bought it to replace a small old cheapie Sunbeam toaster oven that heated up really fast and toasted as quickly as my mom's old conventional pop-up toaster. This machine was a disappointment. It has to heat up for 5-10 minutes before it's even ready for an eggo or piece of bread. Just don't think this thing is going to be fast, because it's not."
2,Wonderful at first.....,"We were extremely satisfied with this toaster oven for about 6 months. I love the wide variety of options available, and used it quite often. At around 6 months of use the springs in the door began to not work properly and the door stopped closing fully. By one year of use the door has a visible 1"" gap, and at times gets stuck open and is very difficult to close."
2,Doesn't Toast Well,"Pros: toaster oven is very roomy and you can cook a lot in thereCons: does not toast well, takes a long time and then can quickly go to burnt; also bottom handle broke in half"
2,This should not be called a Toaster Oven,"I think the name ""Toaster"" oven is a little mis-leading for this product. A couple of reviewers have been critical of those who have complained that this ""toaster"" oven does not toast well. But if you are going to make a product and call it a ""toaster"" oven, then it should indeed toast. Otherwise, just call it a convection oven.This oven does a pretty good job on small items as an alternative to using your regular oven. But if you are looking for a multi-purpose appliance to use for both baking and toasting, keep looking."
2,Barely lasted a year...,I was pretty pleased with this toaster oven until one of the heating elements burned out after a year. I have never had a toaster quit this soon. It also cooked unevenly (much hotter in back corner). I won't buy another Europro.
4,New Life,"I've had this oven for several years.I've enjoyed it and gotten lots of use out of it. I'd hate for it to fail on me because I have several pans that are just its size collected over the years. For some time the fan moving the air for the convection cooking has grown noisier. Recently it got very noisy, then the noise stopped. I was sure the fan had failed and I started shopping for a new oven. On closer inspection, I realized that the fan was working fine just no longer noisy. It may be a short reprieve, but I'll enjoy it while it lasts."
5,I loved reading it... a realistic portrayl that is well written and most informative.,"Anthology of a Crazy Lady written by Sue L. Heisler is certainly one the most beautifully written memoirs I've ever had the honor of reading. This memoir clearly details the all consuming, devastating mental illness known as Bipolar Disorder. Sue L. Heisler covers the broad psychedelic spectrum of how one struggles while in the throes of Manic Depressive Disorder I.e. Bipolar Disorder.In my opinion, this memoir clearly redefines the meaning behind the words ""bearing one's soul.""""I sincerely love this memoir, and I'd like to personally thank Sue L. Heisler for having the courage to write her story."""
1,Piece of Junk,I had my old Rubbermaid wastebasket for about 10 years until the lid disappeared one day (I think my son dropped it inside and it got thrown out with the trash). I bought this to replace it and it lasted about 15 minutes before a piece of it broke off while I was getting it out of the trunk of my car. It cracked in a couple of different places after that--the plastic is incredibly brittle. Then finally the piece that holds the lid on broke off. I had it all of about three months. Don't buy this product--it's (pardon the pun)trash!
3,Works,"It's a standard kitchen trash can. However, the maker did not think through how the trash bag is supposed to fit with the lid. You cannot put the trash bag in without poking holes in the bag to slip over the lid hooks, then you have to add the lid over that."
1,Fowl smelling and burns skin,I have been using this conditioner for years including a few bottles I've purchased from Amazon and directly from Bumble and Bumble. The last bottle I got from amazon smelled like nail polish and burned my skin. Clearly a counterfeit version has ended up in their supply chain.
1,counterfeit product,"I have used this product for years and the item sent from amazon is clearly counterfeit. I was overcome by the smell, burnt plastic is a good description, when I used it. I still had some from my previous bottle and there is absolutely no doubt that the item sent is counterfeit."
2,It was just OK,"I have a lot of hair, and typically love a thick and rich conditioner that leaves my hair silky feeling. This conditioner didn't smell foul, it smelled fresh and nice. I thought the consistency was very thin - seemed watered down, even. I have to use twice as much as usual to get all of my hair, which is the most disappointing part. However, the product did make my hair feel soft. I'm going to try a small container from the BB website and see if there's a difference. I'll let you know..."
5,Arkansas Atlas & Gazeteer,"I have owned several of these in the past for other states but now thatI own property in Arkansas I needed to have one. It's always nice toknow all the backroads, swimming holes, interesting geographical featuresand so on of an area. It makes it easier to identify local landmarkssuch as ""North Hole"" when talking with locals. Great for hunting too."
2,Arkansas Atlas & Gazetteer,I ordered this atlas because it was advertised as showing townships and sections. I was very disappointed that that is not true. The maps did not show township sections. The atlas I received did not have a new copyright date (which REALLY was a surprise) so maybe that is the problem. I do have other state atlas by same company that do have the township and section included in the maps.
5,Excellent Idea!,"Healthy Eating For Busy People offers simple, organized and easy steps to make dietary and lifestyle changes. What I like most about the planner is that the nutrition recommendations build on each other and are reinforced throughout. We all make changes but sticking to them is hard. The concept of Healthy Eating For Busy People will help you overcome this barrier. Healthy Eating For Busy People is a great tool for everybody who wants to eat healthier, increase energy, lose weight, or just feel great!"
2,Great memories but nothing Remastered here.,"To call this CD remastered is a bit misleading. I would have gotten the same results by sticking a cheap microphone near the speaker of an equally cheap television set.The songs and sounds of the Marx Brothers brought back great memories but the skips in the CD and the overall quality of sound was a bit disheartening. If you love the Marx Brothers then buy this CD for the memories, as for the quality, I would definately think twice."
5,aaaaaaamazing,"One of 1999's best. While New York City Boy gets the word out that the boys have a new CD, there are many tracks on this CD worth investigating. NYCB has a Go West/ disco feel to it that is heating up clubs everywhere. Noteworthy tracks are a duet with Kylie Minogue (""In Denial"") and the two opening numbers (""For Your Own Good"") and (""Closer to Heaven""). The album's scheduled third single is ""You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk"" and it could possibly be a UK Christmas #1. It is classic PSB. Definitely worth purchasing. A beautiful piece of work!"
4,Like a vampire walking all night...,"Melodic and relevant, the Pet Shop Boys have created a musical landscape of city living, including the greatest techno-country song ever, You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk. This cd has a definite night-time vibe to it: urban, lonely, and sometimes hopeless, and but with just the right comnbination of irony and hope to reassure us that it could all work out. Also included is a shockingly good duet with Kylie Minogue, which had me checking the liner notes to see who she was. It will never happen, but one hopes that this record will finally allow the Pet Shop Boys to be recognized for what they are: revolutionary, contemporary artsists who have been making masterful records for their subculture for almost fifteen years. But you know what, forget the recognition of the massess, we night walkers would rather keep them for ourselves..."
4,Another fine accomplishment,"The Boys have added another gem to their sterling discography. Anyone who appreciates the underspoken beauty of their music will not be disapointed. Unfortunately, I couldn't give five stars since ""New York City Boy"" is such a wretched song. Notwithstanding, a great CD and a worthy buy."
3,Fun For Half of the Night,"I dont know how to phrase this, but Nightlife is like 2 different cds wrapped in one. How can songs as magical and awesome as ""Vampires"", as rollicking dancefloor fun as ""New York City Boy"" or as poignant and sharp as ""In Denial"", share a CD with such uninspired fare as ""The Only One"", ""Footsteps"" or ""Happiness Is An Option""? As for the singles ""You Only Tell Me..."" and ""I Dont Know What You Want..."" they are fantastic and deserve their rightful place in the PSB canon."
3,Disappointed,"I've been a PSB fan for years. While a throwback to a sound from the past, NIGHTLIFE does not fully cut it for me. The best song (best melody) on the disk is spoiled by a sophomoric lyric (uncharacteristic of PSB) ""You only tell me you love me when you're drunk"" ...both the song title and the lousy lyric... That may sound good, and perhaps even appropriate in a club, but if you want to listen to the songs 10,000 times as I do, you will tire of this lyric very quickly. I consider any disk a good purchase if there is one good song. And on this disk there is: Track one alone is worth the price. If you are a PSB fan, get this disk. If you are considering becoming a fan, get DISCOGRAPHY."
2,Disappointment,"Reviewed all songs and none have any punch. Reminds me of Behavior in 1990. I guess they do not transition between decades very smoothly. Perhaps the CD will seem better over time but it's definetly not one of their better ones. Even the bonus CD has no kick, with remixes and all."
2,"Their Worst Album, what happened??","Boy, this stuff sounds so...LIFELESS. What the heck happened? The Pet Shop Boys were one of the best groups around, did they just run out of gas? There was very little to like about this CD. Its better than most pop music but that's not saying very much."
2,A bit of a mistep,This Cd hasn't caught on with me. The only track I remotely enjoy is New York City Boy. A huge disappointment is the Kylie duet and I am a huge fan of hers. This ranks as one of their worst ever.
5,One of their best albums,"It should be ranked as one of their best (with Behavior and Very - and I think it's even better than Very!)Intelligent lyrics, great melodies. This CD just keeps growing in your mind!And the arrangement of the songs on this CD is just perfect. 'For your own good' and 'Closer to heaven' is so catchy and irresistible. The groove calms down with 'I don't know...' It keeps going deeper and deeper, and suddenly bursts upbeat with 'NYC Boy'. And It concludes with the serene PSB number 'Footsteps' which will linger on your ears for hours."
4,pure pet shop boy pop!,"wheeee! this is the fun part! this album is pet shop boy perfection: a little slowjam melodrama (happiness is an option); orhcestrated dance tunes (for your own good); and, of course, the village people sample in NYC boy. A throwback to late 80's early 90s PSB.The only flaw I can find are the Haddaway leanings in Closer to Heaven. But, packaged between such 80's synth meets 90's dance perfection, it's ok by me!"
5,Pet Shop Boys at its best!,"It really brings out what dance music with smart lyrics can be. These guys have been around and they truly know what they're at, which is making making interesting, deep, dance music with a light retro touch."
5,Mastery,"This album is probably their most accessible album to date. They tap into several avenues of emotions at once. The most pleasing part about this album is that it fuses together elements of their past albums (i.e. Behavior's warmth, Disco2's dancibility, and Very's quirkiness).The trance songs are the ones that keep you coming back.... ""Closer To Heaven"" and ""Radiophonic"" are simply incredible, and as much as I hated ""New York City Boy"" at first, it grows on you. ""In Denial"" and ""The Only One"" are two of the more intriguing slower songs. Armstrong and Rollo are excellent producers who mix well with the Boy's genius... even ""Boy Strange"" is an addictive song for reasons unknown.The album is a remarkable production... the dance mixes should be incredible!"
5,absolute genius,"neil and chris have done it again, from the start to the finish,brilliant. cant wait to see them live in glasgow,newcastle and london"
2,Very Disappointing,"This is not nearly as good as the Pet Shop Boys' previous cds. Tracks like Vampires and You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk are horrible. At least they could have been done with a sense of humor, but lyrics such as ""you're a vampire, I'm a vampire too"" are done with such seriousness that they become really annoying. Also, the music never really takes off. It just plods along at a relatively slow pace for most songs on the cd. However, the first two songs are good - thus accounting for the two stars given here. I'm sorry if you're one you loves this album. I used to think that the PSBs were brilliant and it's sad to hear what their music has become."
3,Only for PetShop Boys fans,"The only reason to buy this album is if you're a Pet Shop Boys fan. If you are looking for a great record to add to your collection, buy ""Very"" or ""Behavior"". Every established artist has bad records, so I guess it was time for Pet Shop Boys to release one. The reason I rated it 3 stars was because I am a Pet Shop Boys fan and I own all of their records. So fans like me will definitely find some enjoyable tunes there, but those unfamiliar with the group will get the wrong impression."
1,Disconnected and Annoying,"As a serious PSB fan, I had a hard time with this one. Sure, you've read over a hundred reviews talking about the good tracks and the sucky tracks, blah blah blah. For me, this is the first PSB album that I could not listen to straight through beginning to end. That alone told me volumes about Nightlife. I credit this album for taking it's chances, but its not well sorted.Now albums like Behavior, Very, or even Introspective: They were spot on. Behavior still sounds fresh even 10 years later."
1,big disappointment!,"I am a big PSB fan, but this album just plain doesn't have it. Even the so-called ""hits"" are just so-so. Throughout all the tracks, they sounded very much like they were half-heartedly re-visiting their glory days from other albums. I very much hate to say it, but they stunk it up big time this time around, and I am stupified at the number of people who believe this to be their best album ever. It's almost as bad as ""Behavior,"" outside of ""Being Boring."" A big thumbs down on this one. Sorry."
3,Buy the singles,Let's face it: the pet Shop Boys are not an album band. Their strong point is their singles and the excellent remixes on these little gems. Regard this album as a sampler for the yet to be released singles.
5,Excellent!,"After a few listens, I think this is a brilliant CD. ""In Denial"" is one of their best songs ever, musically and lyrically. I like Kylie Minogue's addition. ""You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk"" is fabulous as well."
4,Electronica as it should be.,"15 years and still going strong, the Boys once again demonstrate their vitalilty long after all other 80's electronic bands have slipped to ""Where are they now"" status. Standout trax include ""You only love me when you're drunk"" and ""New York City Boy"" which is defiantly 70's-disco in this age of emotionless techno schlock. And for once, the ""G"" word appears on a PSB album. As if we didn't know! Buy it. Live it. Love it."
5,Best from them yet!,"I own all of the Pet Shop Boys music from 12"", to CD to video and I think this is the best they have written. The music really seems to come from the heart, especially the song ""In Denial"" with Kylie Monigue."
2,"Just OK--PSB ""Over The Hill""?","It happens to all pop acts eventually: they run out of nmusical ideas before the record company runs out of promotional ideas.Except for a few tracks, this CD is basically generic filler material. Not quite danceable, not really memorable, and not exactly a first choice listening experience.The ""Thunderpuss Remix"" of New York City Boy should have been included in this CD package, and perhaps a few of the filler pieces could have been dropped in favor of other remixes or other PSB songs.This one is for fans only"
3,Nightlife,"Nightlife being Pet Shop Boys 11th album and their 7th of all new material was released 1999 and sold 1.2 million albums. Singles released from this album were ""I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Any More"", ""New York City Boy"" and ""You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk"". The booklet is filled with the members of Pet Shop Boys in wigs and they look totally strange. All the lyrics are included and we also have a list of whom plays what on the album. I agree with Allmusic that this a 3 star album and is not one of their best efforts so far. 3/5."
3,"Good songs, great price","I agree with Jared that a complete table of contents would make purchasing this book easier. The website www.sheetmusiccatalog.com has a complete listing of all the songs in the book, and there were some that I really wanted so I ordered it (cheaper at Amazon!). It includes some songs from ""Guys and Dolls,"" ""The Most Happy Fella,"" and a few songs written for the movies. (They were the ones I was really interested in.) I think this book will be put to good use."
1,frank loesser songbook,"hey guys- don't you think it might be helpful to list the TITLESof songs included in the advertisement? [like, what's in it?]"
5,Brilliant surreal feel of the film shines through!,"If you enjoyed the film ""Hollywood Hotel,"" I urge you to buy this soundtrack! Introductions to such pieces as ""Let That Be a Lesson To You"" and ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" are included with the songs just as they were in the film. This really holds that Busby Berkeley aura in the soundtrack alone! So ""out there"" you could almost picture Johnny Legend and Dr. Jerry Graham popping out of nowhere to sing a duet!"
3,cute but alittle disappointing,"overall, this shoe is not bad. it fits true to size. moderate arch support and good heel cushioning.seems to be of good quality and sturdy.very cute style. my only problem with this shoe, is that the leather is not as soft as i would like. it is not cushy and does not mold to your feet. my job includes a lot of walking...i work in a hospital. so i found that even though the support was good and size correct after a day of working my feet hurt because the shoe is so firm and unyielding. may be it will be better if you have a sit-down job. i have had this shoe maybe 2 months now and wear it on alternate days to give my feet a break. its getting better though."
3,"Everything's ok, except for the sound...","Grave Digger doccuments their 20+year-career in this double live cd entitled ""25 to Live""... Everything's seem to be fine with this album. The tracklist is awesome, playing old and new tunes...The only problem that I noticed, is the sound. The album sounds more like a high quality bootleg, than a professional recording. The sound of the guitars and drums...Sometimes all the instruments together create noise balls..And it's somehow disappointing, because I'm sure the show was awesome and this live album doesn't give it justice..And Grave Digger's music stands out even more for it's great sound, giving it a more blasting and heavier approach... Old die hard fans will surely appreciate this album, but considering nowadays productions, the live sound could have been much better."
4,Great!,"This is a great album! I always hesitate purchasing ""Live"" albums...usually they are dissapointing. But 25 to Live is FULL of great songs, both old and new, and the crowd is outstanding...so full of adrenaline, and are full of HEAVY METAL FEVER!! I agree that the production could have been better, but it is fine.This 25 to Live, and Rob Halford's Live Insurrection are my absolute favorite ""Live"" albums!"
4,"Seu Jorge, Live at Montreau 2005 CD","I am very biased towards this type of infectious Latin Music. This particular CD, engages the listener with recent contemporary Brazilian music, that's not widely promoted. As a musical persona, I admire Seu Jorge, very much, I like the way he incorporates the rich percussive Brazilian rhythms into his songs....The DVD of this performance is even a cooler thing to own; I turned onto the DVD,way before I ever decided to buy the CD. The need for me to want to listen to this music in another format compelled me to purchase this CD. My favorite song on this CD is #6 ' Te Queria '....The physical quality of my purchase was very satisfactory and so was the price,shipping time,and ease of ordering."
4,The Pacific NW Step-Mother,"When I read the book, it did portray our family dynamics quite accurately. Of course, between the time of the interview and the time the book came out, a lot has changed but the overview of the daily battle is there. When reading the other stories, it was interesting to see how many of the families have the same underlying problems (money, control, privacy) and how each person handles them. I would recommend this book to anyone thinking about entering the step-family way of life or even someone who is there. It is an eye-opener."
5,Tonya Harding Lives on!,"The scandal and controversy that surrounded the Tonya Harding/Nancy Carrigan ordeal was begging for a parody and Julie Brown delivers it with all the overblown melodrama that it deserves. I think the funniest thing in the entire movie is when Tonya is reading her ""death threat"" to a group of reporters and uses VapoRub to start crying but instead ends up yelling that ""it burns"" and then punches her trashy bum of a boyfriend. Though the Lorena Bobbitt portion of the movie is a bit dragged out, it too is a funny parody of a ridiculous story from American culture in the 1990s. Julie Brown is a comic queen and extremely underrated performer. Check this movie out for yourself!"
5,LORENA BOBBIT SCENE IS THE FUNIEST THING I'VE SEEN!,"I think this film is so cool!! I love it when the dog eats the missing penis!! And when Tonya punches out the figure skater for her panties..my mom was crying from laughter, this film is the best!! Julie Brown is so cool!"
2,not worth ninety-two dollars,"This movie has two mini movies. The first is a parody of Tonya Harding and the second one is a parody of Lorena Bobbitt. Julie Brown portrays both of them but everyone's names are slightly changed. Both are somewhat amusing but not gut wrenching hilarious. It's worth renting. Of the two, the Tonya Harding parody is funnier, which happens to star Chrystina Haje of ABC's ""Head of the Class"" as Nancy Hardigan's character."
5,The Possum does it again!...,"I have almost all of George's songs and this album is his best yet. It could almost be compared to his 1980 comeback album ""I Am What I Am."" The song ""50,000 Names"" is especially chilling considering the state of the nation now. I think one of the strongest songs on the cd is ""I Am."" If you want to hear good ol' honky tonk songs and classic George, buy this CD. Long live George!"
4,"Nice Bible, needs Table of Contents showing all that's in it","A very nice bible with large print,colorful art work, and background material for various sections. The only drawbacks are the lack of an index for items such as location of rosary, family geneology, etc.(one has to search their way through the document to find these inclusions) and it lacks a ribboned bookmarker."
5,Great Gift,This was a wedding gift for a neice. Wanted her to have her own family Bible as she is starting her own family now.
3,Australian SF Reader,"A nice change of pace to have Australian mythology in a story like this.A young girl and some other children discover that there arenon-human creatures, and even magical beings living in the corners andhideaways and shadows and parks of the city, and you don't notice themuntil you know how to look."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"This disk is highly compressed in Remastering, the high level frequencies are in your face causing the trombones to sound thin with no low frequency punch, plus the music overpowers the vocals compared to older cds. This cd is probably ok for car or home listening but not recommended for djs, unless you tweak the audio with editing software or during live performance."
5,Good old salsa,"This album is a must for all salsa lovers. Colon and Lavoe are at their best in this cd. For me, this album comes from an era when salsa was at it's best. Calle luna, calle sol and Todo tiene su final are my favorite songs from this cd. This cd brings back great memories when I play it for my friends and family. Just serve a some drinks, and the dancing begins."
4,Red Sox lunch bag is a hit!,My son likes this lunch bag alot. Looks like you can fit alot in it and I like how it has a divider in it.
5,Fine Porcelain at a Fair Price,"This is a birthday gift to my wife and she is very happy with it. Just by looking at the cups and saucers, it is apparent that the quality is very high. The product itself is a real feast for the eyes and coupled with a nice hand-made espresso, it will also excite your taste buds."
1,"Capacity is wrong!!! 3,5 oz max!","Everything is perfect about this set, but... When I finally got it & tried with my coffee machine, I realized, that capacity is not 4oz! It means that if you use an ""European size espresso"" option you definitely can't get your cup from machine without spilling some coffee, I don't even mention putting some sugar in it... So I measured cups first with the previous cups I have for this volume of coffee - Mikasa's one appear to be smaller, then I used a measuring cup & I can say for sure that this cups capacity is neither more nor less than 3.5 ounces."
2,Bad Cookbook Pretty Pictures,"This book is very deficient on the basics. For example, in the directions for Ham Croquette anybody attempting to make béchamel as directed by the book will end up with wonderful wallpaper paste. Save your money there are much better Cuban cookbooks."
1,Too basic,"This is a case of judging a book by its cover. I bought this book for my brother as a gift and decided against it. It is not a book I would recommend to someone who is looking for more than just the basic three or four recipes. It is definitely overpriced for its contents. It was useless since even my brother already knew how to cook the few recipes in it. I have since found a better book (for a better price) ""Memories of a Cuban Kitchen"" by Mary Urrutia Randelman. This has over 200 easy to follow recipes."
5,Great as a snack,"The reviewer below who states these have high fructose corn syrup is wrong. I'm looking at the ingredients list for the Chocolate Fudge bar and it lists corn syrup, but not the notorious high fructose variety. It's a good, tasty snack and a good way to get soy protein on the go."
2,Goodbye old friend,"At one time these bars were my favorite. Tasty and soft. Now they are suitable to be used as paving stones. I have purchased from three or four different Amazon suppliers. Each time the result has been the same - hard and unpleasant to chew. I have stopped purchasing the Genisoy Chocolate Fudge Brownies and now purchase and eat Cliff Bars exclusively. A shame, but life goes on. Even without you Genisoy."
3,"Very very chewy, and tastes good.","The bars are good, however seem to be very hard. Just a little too hard for my taste. They taste good and have good protein. I will try a different flavor next time I order. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys something very chewy."
3,Less good than before,"This used to be one of my favorite bars, but not any longer. Earlier this year, think around the April 2012 time frame, they changed the ""model"" and made it a lot more ""hard"" and less tasty. They used to be much softer and tastier. In fact the last set of bars before they made this change were absolutely great and hence this change has been harder to take. Hope they change it back to what it used to be."
4,chocolatey taste and texture. ..,These brownies tasted funny. I don't know how to describe it but i actually had to give them away. Would never buy it again or refer it to someone. Grainy and weird chocolatey taste and texture. ..
4,A Good Solid Horror-Suspense Thriller,"If you like fast-paced thrills, scary nightmarish scenes, solid plotting, and a pantheon of interesting non-cliched characters, then this is the book for you! A wonderful evening's read that takes you into a world of dark conspiracies between warring vampire families. It is given an extra shot of something special with the author's strange heroine, Professor Silver, an undead criminologist, as she walks the fine line between the dimension of the living and the dimension of the dead. Very entertaining!I just read BloodyMary's review of this horror novel and I sure would like to know if we read the same book or not! Is she kidding? I suppose if you are a ""purist"" who only sees Anne Rice novels or the ""Blade"" movies as the only template for modern vampires, then you wouldn't like this book, but I totally enjoyed its freshness!Check it out!"
5,A fascinating glimpse of a much ignored chapter of radical womyn's herstory,"In ""Free Women of Spain"", Martha Ackelsberg does an excellent job documenting the lives and struggles of Mujeres Libres, a revolutionary organization of Spanish libertarian socialist women fighting against capitalism, fascism and patriarchy. This outstanding book will resonate with activists today engaged in class war feminism (not to be confused with the liberal, corporate, reformist women's movement, i.e. Hilary Clinton or NOW). Not only is the book informative, it is also a real page-turner! I highly recommend this book!"
5,Great product,"Very easy to assemble. Looks great on my deck. Seems to be good quality, but I cannot say how it will hold up in the weather. Nicer than I imagined."
5,Great Outdoor Trash Container,"This is a great product, very durable and looks nice outside. Will come in handy this summer outdoor."
5,Great outside trash can,"I have been looking for an outside trash can when I saw and used this product at a neighbor's backyard party, I was sold. It is nicely design, pretty sturdy and holds a lot of trash (important)."
2,Nice except for the handle,"The product seems sturdy enough, but the handle will not stay on the lid. Every time I try to open the lid to throw something away the handle just comes off in my hand and the lid doesn't even open. I could just glue it on but then it won't slide and the locking feature will not exist. I would NOT recommend this product if you plan on keeping it outside in even slightly windy conditions."
1,"Flimsy,cheap and lightweight.","The large number of glowing reviews induced me to purchase this item. After opening the box which arrived very quickly (shipped UPS by Amazon) I noticed that the plastic panels comprising this item were very light and flimsy. Following the instructions I attempted to assemble it,which proved impossible as the pieces did not fit together. If I had been luckier perhaps I would have gotten one with better fitting pieces,but unfortunately I had no alternative but to return it to Amazon because it could not be assembled successfully. I may not be a rocket scientist or engineer,but I have assembled computer desks,tables and other furniture successfully over the years even allowing for an initial error or two. Even following the instructions to the letter this item could not be assembled so that it was a usable product."
5,Nothing better,"My sister has one of these but I was certain I could find something better for less money. I couldn't. Finally got one and put it together in less than 5 minutes. This will last for years. Great size; good weight for stability; nice looking addition to patio. Will probably get a second for recycling. Don't hesitate; best on market. (Fast shipping, too!)"
4,It's tops of the top loaders,"These tidy and attractive trash containerssnap together with bottom and top making the unit rigid and secure.rated as a 30-33 gal size, it small enought to fit into a corner out of traffic. I would buy them (we purchased 3) again."
5,Awesome looking for Outdoor Trash Cans!,These trashcans are really upscale as far trash containers go. they have lock down lids and seal very nicely. They have clean lines and really cleaned the area up. I did order 3 in place of the 2 containers that I had and I will probably still need to order one more. So be aware that they are a smaller size.
1,Not Practical,"There's no way to attach a trash bag inside and it's impossible to put in a completely filled bag so in order to use it, I have to only partially fill bags."
5,Best outdoor Garbage Container,This is exactly what I was looking for. It is the best outdoor garbage container. It makes outdoor cleanup so much easier and neater. It's a nice size and holds a very large black bag. Highly recommended!
5,Suncast GHI732 Outdoor Trash Hideaway,"Easy to assemble, holds a lot of trash, is rain proof and doesn't overturn. Matches my pool deck box and cabinets."
5,Great Trashcan,"Bought this trashcan for the deck - it's GREAT. Was easy to put together and LOVE that the lid locks tight, no worry about critters getting into the trash. A MUST for every deck/patio/pool area."
2,Suncast Outdoor Trash can,"While the product went together quickly and just like the instructions said, the lid leaves alot to be desired. The mechanism designed to slide/open and lock does not stay attached to the can and instead ends up in your hand.Because there is nowhere to hook or secure a trash bag inside I have decided to make it my recylcle can instead.I would not buy this item again nor would I reccommend it if you are planning on placing regular trash in it."
1,Worst customer service,"I needed some help when I put the pieces together. The customer service person was not helpful and kept saying not our responsibility. Once a piece is set up you can not remove it which make the trash hard to clean or even to put well together if you make a mistake bec that's it. Not a nice company, product okay, over rated. They are better companies and product for this price out there."
3,Disappointed in the size,I thought this product would be larger...it is nice looking but I would have preferred something bigger
1,Almost bought this...,and when I got to check-out realized that the shipping was a whopping $23.88! That is insane. It's exactly what I'm looking for but no way will I pay such a criminal shipping charge.
5,Assembled in about 5 minutes,"Looks great and took only 5 minutes to assemble. Followed the simple instructions and assembly was a snap!Replacing an antique wooden box I had outside for recycling plastics and can. Can't wait to have a bag that's not full of water and /or snow by recycle day. Hopefully this will stand up well to Wisconsin's ever changing weather, particularly the freezing, icy winters. So far, I'm pleased with my purchase. Will try to remember to update after winter. Definitely a good buy through Amazon as usual."
4,"great, but do not overfill!","First, let me say that it is a rare item, indeed, that over-estimates the time it takes to put it together. This is one of those products. It took less than 5 minutes....what a joy! Thiss is a pretty solid item, and the best part is that the opening can lock, so critters cannot get in. The color blends well and does not stand out. The texture is a little grainy, but wash it with a hose and you should not have any major staining. It is not overwhelming either, the size is just right. 4 stars becuase if try to stuff it even little, you will have a hard time removing the bag. Use a thicker bag to avoid problems. A great value at $30-$40."
5,I love this trash can! Perfect for my kitchen and my dogs.,"This is the best purchase I've made for my house in a very long time. It replaces a small garbage can in my kitchen that was on top of a storage container to keep the dogs out of it. This new trash can fits perfectly in my small kitchen. It's too tall for the dogs to get into - and I highly doubt they would ever be able to knock this over - it's very sturdy. It takes a large garbage bag, which is great because then I don't have to take out the garbage as much. Just so you know, the lid doesn't actually ""lock""... but the can is high and the lid is not right up to the edge - so my dogs haven't even thought about trying to get into it. I can't believe how happy I am about a garbage can!"
2,Looks great - but fills up with water,"We were looking for a decent looking trash can for our new outdoor space that our dogs could not get into so this appeared to be the perfect solution. It was easy to assemble, looked great (very neutral), and the dogs have never gotten into it. However, it is not water tight. If you always remove the trash, always remeber to remove the bag before it rains, or it you have a covered outdoor space it may work great for you. We kept a bag in all of the time and it was a hassle to move it and dump the water while tring not to dump the trash all over the yard. Very disappointing."
4,good to use for outdoor,easy to assemble. looks nice. good for outdoor. But not heavy enough. So we have to tie it up to the fence.
2,"Tears holes in trash bags, poor design. Durable.","We bought two of these almost three years ago. We're ultimately junking them for one reason. They have uneven surfaces on the inside, not sharp per se, it's more a lattice of plastic ridges, knob-like projections, etc., which look more to be part of the manufacturing process, but invariably when you try to pull out a trash bag, some can, bottle, etc. catches something sticking out from the inside of the container, and the trash bag tears. I love my dremel, etc., but there just isn't an easy modification (sanding, smoothing, etc.) to obviate this problem. It's just not been worth it, and we're looking for something new. Aside from that, the construction and value were just fine. They lasted, both indoors and out."
3,a little dab will do ya,This stuff is nice but don't pile it on. A little dab will do ya! The body wash was good until it fell off my dresser and soaked in to my rug. I was wondering why the smell in the room was so overpowering!! I figured it out days later and am still trying to get the stink out of the rug. Woops!
4,dungeon is the appitamy of a DECENT power metal band,"well lets see this band comes from australia, WOW i didnt even know that australia had anyone in the power metal scene. this album is a decent entry to my collection of power metal, thundering drums, killer riffs, soaring vocals what more can a metalhead like myself ask for.....in addition i give this cd 4/5 stars a really good effort from one of my new favorite bands, and there even from australia! \m/"
2,Pretty bad,A Rise to Power wasn't great but it was alot better than this. The DVD in my opinion is way better than this CD.
5,Cheeseburger is the new Jesus,"Bow down and worship the greatest rock band in the land...CHEESEBURGER!Can't say enough about their 3 chord wizzardary. You will get nekkid and holler ""YEAH"" to the infectious sounds of drunken perfection."
2,Don't Be Fooled!,"The first 'song' is a snipet only - a very short version of the Sex and the City Theme Song. The rest of the songs are good songs, but they are not performed by the original artists. Most of them sound ..OK, but some of them sound a bit off. It could be because of being trained to the versions the 'real' artists sing(i.e. This Kiss and Breathe are not performed by Faith Hill and you can tell because the voices just are not strong or 'technically improved' I guess you could say). I really wanted this CD for the theme song - it's so catchy. The only way to get a good tast of it would be to hit the repreat button about 10 times."
2,Not What You Expected,"I bought this CD because it was on sale, and it seemed like a good deal. Honestly, I think the purchase was worth it just for the Sex and the City theme, but every other song on the disc is just a cover, in other words, the original artists are nowhere to be found in the vocal recordings, but I guess thats why they can sell the disc at such a cheap price."
4,Dependable,"I have to start off by saying that these dykes took a while to break in. Luckily I remember a Klein Rep once say that sometimes due to manufacturing some cutters (individual basis only) can take longer to break in. I had to use these many times like I would my linemans to bang something just to get them to break in. Now that they have, like most of my klein tools, I have zero complaints. Product works great."
5,Great cutting!,"This pair of pliers provides great cutting. It is made in the Journeyman line, and is top-notch!"
4,Lucky You!,"Congratulations, you have managed to locate one of the best groups to hit the music world, even if they don't get the credit they deserve just yet!! I have been lucky enough to see these folks in concert - if you get the chance, do it!! This cd is amazing, and only a hint of the magic they bring to the stage! I hope to see more of them, and another cd!!"
2,The Kindle version doesn't have any drawings!,"I bought this one because I wanted to see some of the drawings. However, the Kindle version contains just the text, and no drawings or pictures. It's a bit dissapointing. The 2 dollar price tag should have warned me, but still, I feel a bit cheated."
1,Old-fashioned or just appalling?,"I quite liked this book at the beginning, but I began to get tired of the old-fashioned plot of a young woman in danger who turns to an older, more experienced man who takes care of her completely, down to picking out her clothes. I can understand that plotline in a Regency romance, but surely in 1971 women were more interested in a partnership than a sugar daddy? I was truly appalled, however, when (*SPOILER ALERT*) she realized that he truly did love her when he flipped her over and spanked her for disobeying his orders (and putting her life in danger). Yeah, when he hits you, it means he really loves you...I read another romance by Anne McCaffrey from the 1970s which was much better - The Kilternan Legacy - about a woman picking up the pieces after a nasty divorce. She inherits a property in Ireland and takes her children to check it out. Less suspense, danger, and sex than Ring of Fear, but more fun and romantic. I have also liked many of her fantasy novels."
4,As Good as it Gets,Great CD! All the music from the movie plus a few suprizes!!I'm ready to lip-synch myself a whole new repetroir!
5,An enjoyable collection of erotic poems. A feast for the soul.,"This great little book is a collection of erotic poetry taken from sources around the world. It is a companion to the Everyman collection of Love Poems. If you are seeking a collection of pornographic poems, you will be disappointed. The poems in this collection are sensuous, spicy and sometimes passionate. Some are even humorous. This 285 page volume will amuse and entertain you. A fantastic collection of erotic poems.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Season of the Warrior: a poetic tribute to warriors)."
5,This is an essential short horror collection,"Among horror authors writing short fiction, I consider only Ramsey Campbell and Thomas Ligotti to be of importance in today's field. This book, which is a sort of career retrospective of Campbell's work, is an absolutely essential book for any fan of intellegent and moody horror. Campbell's style is at once clautrophobic and incredibly original. He is a master at creating uneasy, tense set-pieces, and even better at creating views of our world that are slanted in an undefinable yet vaguely grotesque manner. Campbell is subtle where other authors such as King are blatant and obvious; but this subtlety masks a cold calculation that is as eerily effective as anything I've ever read. Campbell is one of the few authors around today who is writing vital, important short horror, and this book displays his intense genius. An added plus are the atmospheric and intriguing illustrations by J. K. Potter"
2,Won't hold up if left outside!,"I purchased the Duracord model thinking it would hold up well if left outside. While the hammock itself has held up very well, the spreader bars did not. After only 1.5 years, the hammock roping looks just as it did when I bought it. However, BOTH of the spreader bars have essentially disintigrated and split completely in two in multiple locations. This renders the hammock itself useless. Pawleys Island needs to consider a different composition material for the spreader bars which will hold up as well as the roping itself. If you're thinking you're getting a hammock that will hold up well left outside and provide years of service, save your money and buy a cheaper cotton or polyester version."
4,The new management imperative in finance by James T. Gleason,"The author provides an excellent overview of the development of risk management products and best practices since the early 1980s. The book also covers the latest developments taking place in counterparty risk measurement and the move beyond relying on value-at-risk models only towards 'stress testing'. In the final chapters of the book, the author provides a roadmap for developing an enterprise wide risk management framework and some of the pitfalls that may be encountered in its implementation. The book is clearly written by someone with practical experience of the subject matter and, unlike many other books in the field, explains the issues without reverting to complex mathematics and statistics."
1,Disappointing - I threw mine away,"I came to this one with high expectations, but I ended throwing away the CD. The sound makes the singing unlistenable: the volume swoops up and down at the beginning and ending of phrases; these great singers would be embarasseed to hear themselves on it. What a shame! the music deserves a better technology, and you can get it in other recordings."
4,The magic of Summer of 42,"I love Michel Legrand's music with ""Summer of 42"" as my favorite. I searched under Legrand and this CD came up. I do not speak French but knew right away it contains my favorite theme song. I did not know however, that Legrand performed all the songs in French on this CD. I thought it's a collection of soundtracks composed by him. There are 20 plus pieces in a wide variety of styles. His singing voice is not outstanding but his music is wonderful. If you are a Legrand fan, add this to your collection."
2,Stopped working after two months,"This was great for two months, and then it stopped working. I'll probably replace it with a manual frother (looks like Bodum has a pretty nice one).Were it still working, I would give it four stars. Here's why:- The stand it comes with is convenient and sleek, but slightly awkward to use -- you have to put the frother in from the top, and the half-open design means that the tips of the wires scratch the body of the frother if you fumble.- It sometimes turns on in the off position when you apply pressure against the switch, which can be surprising/splatter milk everywhere/etc until you get used to it.- Other than that, it looks good and froths cold milk to triple its volume in less than five seconds."
1,Won't work in raw milk!,"This may be a great gadget, but if you are a raw milk drinker like me, it whips the cream into butter. I was so looking forward to using this, because I love my cappuccino, but don't bother with it if you do not use homogenized milk."
3,aerolatte with stand,"The Aerolatte is fine. Don't expect a stand. I ordered one with a stand and received one without a stand, returned it since I wanted a stand and had paid for a stand, then received another without the stand, then, when I inquired, gave up since I was told there was a ""widespread problem"" involving the stand and I was invited to return the second one for a refund."
4,Good Read,I tend to get a little annoyed with heroines who constantly question love. In spite of that this was a good book that I enjoyed.
1,What Happened???,"I can't beleive I bought this book! It was too rushed I am used to the heroine and hero caring for each other first before falling into bed together. I mean they were already doing it in the second chapter!! I only read the first couple of chapters and couldn't get myself to read anymore. I rather like books like Jude's ""Knight in Shining Armor.""This novel really turned me off it's almost more like a bad contemporary novel than a historical one. I found the heroine irritating and way too childish and the hero could of been likeable if he wasn't too ""easy."" I'm sorry Mrs Deveraux but this type of romance was definately not my type. My recommendation for the reader definately borrow it first before you decide to buy."
3,Not Deveraux's best... but good...,"This is not one of Jude Deveraux's best stories, but it is very good. If you don't like this one, don't let it be the judge of whether you will read another by this author... she's a very talented author, and many of her books are a great deal better than this one.Although I did enjoy this story, the heroine was a little too dependent on the hero. I would have liked to see more strength in her, even though she did go through a lot in the story. Nevertheless the story was pretty good and I did enjoy it."
3,Okay Book,"This book was fairly okay. I found the heroine mostly annoying. If you don't mind getting fustrated with the way the characters think/act towards each other, then you'll find a little enjoyment in your time reading it."
2,I hate this book,".... The Lost Lady was the first book of Jude Devaeaux I've reed and I thought it would be the last. Fortunately I was wrong. I write ""fortunately"" because Jude Deveraux is now one of my favourite romance's authors. I didn't like in this book everything- I found it boring and feministic. Thr romances schouldn't be feministic- when I read book, I want to forget about reality, I want to read about times in which ""political correctness"" doesn't exsists- in this times man wasn't affraid to kiss the woman.(Sorry about my gramatic mistakes, but I'm not from USA and my english isn't very good)"
2,A Deceptively Bad Album,"I'm not sure how the makers of this CD got away with claiming that this music was performed by the Hollywood Symphony ""Orchestra"" and ""Chorus."" In reality, what this package presents as an orchestra is merely a collection of synthesized/sampled instruments playing a smattering of tracks from the series in a not-so-musical way.Not all of the tracks are horrible, mind you; apart from the Final Fantasy VIII tracks (8-11), most of the songs on this disc are worth a listen. The problem is that this CD feels more like an emulation than an elaboration. Lacking both live instruments and any truly inspired arrangements, it fails to deliver anything beyond the original music.It's cheap price is it's one saving feature. For avid fans, it's worth checking out. Just don't expect anything beyond what you're paying for."
1,Holy Crap!,"Wow.Hollywood Symphony Orchestra MY BEHIND!!This was the crappiest 4 bucks I've ever spent... Immediately after reading the following from the back of the CD...""Earth has been decimated by a meteor... The beautiful and capable Dr. Aki Ross is Earth's last hope against extinction. This new recording, featuring the world-renowned Nobuo Uematsu, captures the excitement and drama of this popular videogame-turned blockbuster movie.""a few things...1) to the right of the above paragraph was this message: ""THIS RECORDING IS NEITHER SPONSORED OR ENDORSED BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS OR OWNERS.""2) The writer for the CD cover has clearly not ever played any of the FF games--he fails to notice that any of the FF games are continuations.3) The FF film was not ""a blockbuster movie"".Look, if you want to have better covers of Final Fanatsy music, scrounge around inocremix.org or vgmix.comAmateurish digital instrumentation, completely craptastic. I'd give it zero stars, but that wasn't an option..."
1,Stick With Imports,"This is positively awful. The first track is bearable, the rest is horrendous (can't comment on track 12, my copy is older and doesn't have it). The ""instruments"" aren't even properly blended. I use quotes because it sounds totally synthesized. Symphonic Suite, Grand Finale, Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec, these are the albums you should look for if you want to hear orchestral Final Fantasy."
2,dissapointment...,"i thought that i had found something good...when i listened to it i discovered it wasn't even worth that! most of the songs sound exactly like they did on the game (which is okay, if tahts what you want) or worse. In liberi fatali they didn't even sing the words, it just sounded like they used the chorus sound on an electric keyboard. there was hardly any time in the whole CD taht i actually thought a whole orchestra was playing this. the only good track was the last one, ViVi's theme. well, if you can get this CD for less than $[money]then if you have nothing better to do with your money, buy this. but i suggest you save up and buy another, better final fantasy CD."
1,Don't Buy this CD,"These people ""MajesticMix"" or whatnot, need to be arrested under the charges of false advertisment, false identity, and for just plain sucking. Seriously, all they are doing with this CD is using the Final Fantasy name to make money. I could make better music with my Yamaha PSR 170 and a tape recorder. The so-called ""Hollywood Symphony Orchestra"" is nothing but a single guy sitting in his room with a synthesizer. This, and all of ""Majestic Mix"" people's works are a disgrace to Squaresoft. Seriously, I think Squaresoft should look into this and file a lawsuit or something."
2,And I thought the music couldn't be bad....,"Pitiful. This CD is pitiful. I saw this in the store and I was freaking out at it, especially for the low pricing on such great music. After I got it, I was extremely disappointed. This is mostly MIDI music, or so it sounds. The Hollywood Spoonplayers apparently can't interpret music. The only good tracks are the overworld theme for FF7 (which, I might mention, it does not play the complete song), Vivi's Theme (cause it has the TINIEST bit of spunk), and..... Well, that's actually it. Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinnosec has been transformed into a choirless woo wooing noise. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! BUY PRAY OR ONE OF THE GENERATION FF CDS!!!!!"
2,One Good Track.......would have rated it 1 1/2 Stars if even,Ok......AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!! As luck would have it I found it a a garage sale. The only track whorth listening to is track 12 which is ViVi's Theme from FF9. The others well....They could have done better. Most of the songs are to put it nicely......SUCK (At least the way they where done). The only reason I rated 2 (1 1/2 to be accualy) is because of ViVi's Theme at the end. This is not whorth your time. Get the imported CD's they have much better music on them.
1,DO NOT buy this CD... support Project Majestic Mix instead,"The only good track on this terribly synthesized rendition of Uematsu's music is Vivi's Theme! And this wasn't even done by the Hollywood ""Symphony Orchestra"", but was a sample track from CD-in-the-making Project Majestic Mix: A Tribute to Nobuo Uematsu!Project Majestic Mix ( www.majesticmix.com ) is a fan-produced CD-set featuring rock, techno, ambient, and orchestral arrangements of some of Final Fantasy's best music. You can even find mp3 demos of the music, and even free full-length aborted tracks, at the above website. Scheduled to be released Q1 2002, Project Majestic Mix certainly deserves more attention than this horribly failed ""Symphony Orchestra"" creation."
1,NEVER BUY THIS!,"I have ever listen to Final Fantasy 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 original sound tracks.I found this CD was really trash in a few second.Because all the tracks on this CD were inferior to original ones in quality.Never buy this!"
5,Your trip to Rome starts now..,"If you're from abroad, want to Visit Rome, and do Rome ""The Italian way"" than this is the guide you need. Places to eat, stay and shop are well described. A ""must"" for Rome visitors. Your trip to Rome starts at home..."
4,Manufactured/Modular Home Pre-requisite,"This was not my first effort at learning more about manufactured homes--I owned a double wide home, manufactured by Fleetwood, about six years ago. My wife & I loved the home but business required us to move. I'm now considering a similar home for retirement. There was a lot of good information in the book and I intend to follow the recommendations when/if I go forward with my plans.This would be an excellent starting point for anyone just thinking about this type of home."
5,great book,"This book is fantastic if you are having a new home manufactured, which was our original intent prior to buying this book. After reading it, however, we concluded that, for us, we would be better off purchasing an existing home as a lot of the hassle would be already out of the way. Sure, it's great to have the ability to customize everything to your liking by building new, but, as the book illustrated, there are lots of potential problems that you may not be able to handle. This book is an informative read and I would recommend it to anyone considering manufactured home life to help them determine if new or used would be the way to go for them."
2,An insider's perspective,"As a life-long professional in the manufactured housing industry, I have a few exceptions with Mr. Grissom's book. Everything he did was done well, but he often missed the mark from the perspective of those of us within the industry. Although his numbers were somewhat accurate, and he made some valuable suggestions, it is obvious that this book misses the mark when it comes to being useful within industry circles. In other words: It misses key points of reality. We don't think and act the way he describes. We use another author's version as a training guide here."
1,Terrible Taste,I ordered this product because I hate mixing huge amounts of creatine with water or juice. I could hardly tolerate the taste of this stuff. It is supposed to be fruit punch flavored but the taste was terrible.
4,I like it just fine,This creatine is quite tolerable. Easier to take than ones I've tried in the past.
1,Karcher Pressure Washer,This is an addendum to the review I wrote on 5/9/2003. I disassembled the hose reel to attempt to see why it was leaking so vigorously (and has leaked since the day it came home). The way the pressurized water or chemical is transferred to the reel involves a couple of ten cent O-rings on either side of a manifold and these were dried out and brittle. ...Should you purchase this product anticipate that parts may or may not be a problem for you as they have been for me.
3,"Nice shirt, thin material","This is a basic T-shirt. Of course, with the ""Hannah"" name on it my daughter loves it. I thought the material was awfully thin for the price."
3,Annie Warbucks Review,"Hmmm. I don't think that this book is as good as the original Annie. There is a couple of nice songs in it, my favorite being ""I Always Knew"". I would reccomend buying this book only if there is a certain song in it that you want, as most are unfamiliar and not good audition choices."
1,German Engineering?,"Got the wheels on this unit and realized that the case had plastic pieces floating around inside.After a closer look this is what I found...A yellow plastic piece about 1/16X1/2X1/2 which held the heavy pump. The shroud over the pump and fan had split,also flimsy and doubled as a mount.(yea right) all this caused the pump to shift and snapped the control knob and outlet,both plastic and way too cheesey!! I doubt this could stand being knocked over and dropping it would destroy it!!....If you buy it and it makes it to your place in one piece ,treat it like a Faberge' Egg...Germen Engineered ? Must be East Germany!!!"
1,Worst money we ever spent,"Unless we're doing something wrong, this thing couldn't clean a clean plate, much less ""cut the dirt"" off anything. The only thing it will do is cut money from your bank account. Do yourself a favor. If you see this piece of junk on the TV, quick, change the channel!! If you see it on a shelf, walk slowly away from it and MAYBE what it's made out of won't rub off on you. In other words, this has to be the WORST piece of... er... refuse, I've ever bought. If I could get a refund, I would, but I'm not holding my breath. Heaven help any of you who do not heed this warning and buy this thing anyway. You have been warned."
1,garbage,"The inlet valve has broken on 2 machines(one was a warranty replacement), will never buy Karcher again."
1,Wish I'd Read These Reviews First,"Wow, what a piece of junk. I bought at BJ's Club and haven't tried to return yet. We'll see if their service is better than (at least this piece) of merchandise...."
3,helpful massage dvd,"This DVD was pretty good. We were looking for an informative dvd to help amateurs do some massage. The descriptions were good, but the camera angle wasn't so helpful at times. We had to use a little deductive reasoning to figure out what a couple words meant. So maybe some definitions would be good, too."
5,Good for the Basics,"Good dvd for the basic techniques. Great for starting out or just to learn how to massage for fun. The strokes are good, solid techniques. Great learning tool for beginners"
3,"Not earthshaking, but okay","This video is VERY basic and VERY boring. I learned a little bit from watching it, but it's definitely ONLY for starters. It's unimaginative and dull, but then, it's a massage video, not an instructional on disco dancing."
3,Basic Massage Therapy,"I expedited a better quality for a DVD, not a VHS tape copied straight to a DVD. There was no menu or sub-menus. The massage technique shown was good."
4,Good for those who learn by watching,"Basic Message Therapy is a really good DVD for those who learn by watching with just a little instruction. The instructor demonstrates the proper message techniques and gives advice as she messages each part of the client's body.After watching the video, I had fun messaging my partner putting to use the techniques and advice I learn from the video. My partner was very surprised at my messaging techniques and felt really relaxed afterward."
4,OK - for basic massage techniques,This is a basic swedish massage video - if you want to learn some of the basic strokes it is a good source.
1,Are we reviewing the same product?,"Buyer beware...the pretty case cover contains a poorly made video. The sound is muffled and tinny and the video quality is just ok. I've even seen the Blu-ray version and the material is the same content and quality. I was expecting something more instructional and educational from a dvd titled Basic Massage Therapy. This was little more than watching someone give a massage, with occaional verbal cues as to what they were doing. Little explanation as to the how and why. You will learn more by getting a massage."
2,not great,"This book gives some basic instruction to techniques, but the camera view often shows the demonstrator's back, blocking the view of her hands."
4,It is a pretty good way to learn about massage,"This video is a great video for beginners like me. I watched it twice and I could do most of the techniques. Mostly this video shows someone giving a massage to someone else without too much verbal instruction. The video is kind of cheaply made, but it is a good video."
4,Great Pictures,"The reason to buy this book is the excelent photographs of the details of the ship. As a B&W picture book, it is excelent.The text is generally weak with a number of technical errors. The author comes across as a fawning admirer rather an expert.The book could have been much improved with more complete diagrams of the ship. (Has plans but not of the superstructure or lower decks.)"
3,This book is OK,"I am an illustrator and I am working on a painting of the USS Texas as it looked in 1914. I ordered this book, hoping for some good detailed photos... well they aren't in this book. Other wise, the text contains many interesting facts and details of the ship."
2,It is difficult to use.,"the way the tank needs to be positioned makes it hard to use to fill mowers, snow blowers etc which is why I got it. It also does,t flow easily and is hard to keep nthe hose from pinching off. Not recommended"
5,Comfortable and good-looking!,"Great shirt! Very comfy, soft on the skin, good fit, washes well and good-looking, too. Can't be beat!"
4,Good for the price,Bought this pedal after watching the dolphin street video. The univibe effect seemed a little weak butAfter modifying it managed to get the throbbng sound i was looking for. Happy with the product and with the quick delivery. Also pleased to note it came with a battery ;-)
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with the sound of this unit. The ""vibe"" effect (it's actually a Univibe-type effect, not true vibrato) sounded very ""fake"" to me (not at all like the Cool Cat Vibe from the same company). There was a noticeable volume drop when the effect was engaged, and I also heard some noise in my signal chain when the effect was not engaged. Combined with the (known) cheap construction, that made this pedal a big disappointment.Based on YouTube videos, I'm going to give the Cool Cat Vibe a try... it seems to have a much more realistic Univibe sound (and apparently uses the same optical technology as the original Univibe):Danelectro CV1 Cool Cat Vibe Pedal"
5,Break out the Kleenex for this one!,"Admittedly based on the Jackie Gleason classic ""Gigot,"" this film will have you reaching for the tissues as it pulls your heartstrings. William H Macy does an amazing silent performance. Family friendly, heartwarming, highly recommended!"
4,"IT'S NO GIGOT, BUT VERY GOOD REGARDLESS!","I am a fan of the original film 'Gigot' this film is based on, but after seeing the original, it just seems a little inferior. Macy, Rickles and the rest of the cast are in good form in this sometimes sad, but sweet and inspiring story that was adapted by a story written by comic legend Jackie Gleason. If I had never seen the original, I would have bumped it up another 1/2 star. It's well worth seeing and will bring a tear to your eyes before it's over."
4,Macy fan,If you think that William H. Macy is one of the best character actors out there then this is one of those films worth watching
4,Not for the Faint of Heart - But Still Worth Seeing,"(Note: This review was written by my wife, Laura...)A spiritual domino effect is displayed in this provocative film as two unlikely souls come together to show each other what it means to love and heal. The movie immediately pulls you into the harsh reality of their world, which might be too harsh for some viewers. Drug use and despair are not uncommon in this film as it paints the picture of how disconnected the characters feel.Everything happens for a reason and there is hope for brighter days even in the most desolate of circumstances is what you will find by this almost too realistic film. You will laugh, you will cry, but you may find that, although there is much wisdom and love in this movie, you may not enjoy being pulled through the mud to get there."
5,Nice home tool set,This really comes in handy for the home. Very good quality tools from black and decker for the money.
1,Inaudible sound,"This is an excellent performance. Not in the baroque/authentic vein of more recent interpretations like Harnoncourt's or Gardiner's, but that makes it all the more vital and alive. The sound however of this particular issue is so bad that it is impossible to listen to. This reviewer is used to sound from the first decade of the 20th century, so when I say bad, I mean really bad, and this is not an inherent fault of the source recording but purely a blunder in the mastering."
5,Ageless fun,"We bought this for our 7 year old son to hook-up to his Sony Psyc Walkman. It's waaaaay fun and the entire family sat and watched Bumblebee do his thing for quite a while. I only wish that the plug chord was longer. It's quite short in distance from the CD player when plugged-in. BUT...it was the hit of Show-and-Tell when they returned to school from ""Christmas"" break and the sound quality is very impressive."
3,Movie toy quickly forgot about,My sun loved the toy because he just saw the movie. He connected it to his radio and he also had it record a song. He played with it a lot at first but now just sits on the shelf. The wings on the back that are translucent and look like the glow came off and will not stay on (snap on)
3,"Cute, but not really a toy","I bought this because it was a great deal of the day.It is fun and cute, but my son watched it for two seconds and walked away. If you are a total NERD for Transformers and want one for your desk to say ""Hey, Check This Out..."" then it's cool.Kids aren't going to like it a whole lot."
2,Not as expected,"Bought 2. One did not work properly. Did not read clearly to see it does not transform. Also, 5 year old was not interested in ""fancy speaker box"", but 8 year old was. There are many other models that will make your kids happier."
2,Expected More For The Price,"Length:: 0:30 MinsAfter knowing what the TMX Elmo can do for $40, I figured this Beatmix would be pretty sweet. I doesnt move its feet or its arms, just twists its waist a little, bops its head, and lifts the doors. Also, I tried playing several songs with different beats (techno, rock, rap, country, etc) and I can't see the difference in dances."
4,Cute!,I purchased this item actually last xmas for a friend because her favorite character from the movie is Bumble-Bee. Mind you this friend is almost 40 and thoroughly ENJOYED seeing Bumble Bee dance to the music and move around.The only downside was that the USB cord that comes with him is REALLLLLLY SHORT and kind of hard to attach to a port and still be able to have him move around freely. Other than that - she loved it!
4,Cute speakers.,Bumble Bee is cute and this is a good way for kids who do not want to use headphones to hear their MP3 players. It is definitely a conversation piece.
4,perfect christmas gift,"I bought this watch for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. She absolutely loved the watch. There was only one small hitch, she's very petite and we had to take the watch to the jewelers to have it sized for her. Removing the links in the center still didn't make it small enough, but other than that it was perfect!!!"
2,HARP MUSIC,"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT AS EACH SONG SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE THE PREVIOUS AND FOLLOWING. MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THE HARPIST LIKES, NOT FOR ME."
2,"Not a fan of harp music, but loved the arrangement of ""Malaguena""","I loved the arrangement of Malaguena for the harp, even better than quitar. Except for this one selection, however, I do not care for the CD. I am not really a fan of harp music."
3,Sound Healer review,"I own another Remo frame drum which I like. I purchased two of these 12"" Buffalo Drums since I anticipated a deeper bass resonance, which I'd expect in a shamanic drum. The larger Remo frame drums have this deeper resonance; the two which I purchased had different pitches, however: one low and one higher. The higher pitched drum was a bit disappointing, given this is a shamanic-type instrument. The lower pitched drum was very satisfactory. To be fair, however, even many of the natural skin drums have higher pitches which vary widely with the humidity. I bought this because humidity and outdoor moisture is always an issue with drum heads - they expand and contract with moisture content in the air. Not so with these synthetic drum heads: they maintain their pitch. My wife is very happy with her 12"" model, which she has painted with acrylics, and she is fine with the sound as well. So go figure...These drums are light-weight, portable, and have a generally good tone. Happy Travels!"
4,great drum,"So, I only gave it four stars because I was hoping for a bit of a lower pitched sound, but I think to get that, you have to go with 14"" or larger. This drum is a good size for me, as over time it does get a little heavy. The sound is good, but just a little higher pitched than I was hoping for."
1,Can't buy it if I don't know what it is,"Occasionally Amazon offers products with inadequate descriptions, and this is an egregious example. For this beverage container they provide no external dimensions or internal capacity, only a single photograph with nothing for scale or reference. Is it 3 inches tall or 12? Does it hold 6 ounces or 2 quarts? Who knows? Who would buy based on this information? -- a fool."
3,very small,"This bottle was much smaller than i anticipated, and therefore I do not use it much. I prefer my kleen kanteen or sigg bottles."
4,Mandatory for advanced pianists!!,"This is a fantastic book in every sense of the word. The way Gerig written it is very great in itself in that it presents the piano from a historical view as well as purely technical one. So not only does it enhances the inquiring musician's mind in the technical methods,employed by the masters of the past centuries,but it gives practical technical and practice tips which show immediate improvements. I give it four stars because it is somewhat tedious to read. Perhaps it only seems that way because I devoured half of it in three days."
4,An underrated movie,"Although this film is not as famous as other baseball movies such as Field of Dreams, 61*, Fever Pitch,......etc, it is one of my favorite baseball movies after I watched it.The main scene is back to the 1909 World Series with two HOFers, Honus Wagner and Ty Cobb. You can see something about baseball cards, the notorious Ty Cobb's behaviors and the romance of Honus Wagner.The story is lovely and charming while the pace is soft and gentle. Although the cast is not so well-known, they got the job done pretty well. Try to grab a DVD and watch it. You will find it worth the time and money."
4,Great guide,Got this for my dad and he's already identified quite a few of the birds that visit our feeders. Great photos and information. The book is well organized and makes identifying easy.
5,Good Book,This is a really good book if you want to narrow your birding down to just the Carolina birds. It really hastens identification compared to a large book like Birds of North America. It's also easy to carry along with you. I recommend this book!
3,Labeled as new?,"Purchased book because it was labeled as new, however, I think it should have been labeled as ""good."" You can tell it was well used when it arrived. Book serves it's purpose but I was a little disappointed because it was a gift. Thankfully to my husband!"
1,Only one Arrived!,I really loved these earrings but only one arrived. So I decided to make a necklace out of it.
4,Good content but requires additional reading,I recently used this book to study for the SNA Server 4 exam and found it to be very good. There are very few study guides for this exam but it will get you though with some cross referencing from some of the excellent technet artcles on this subject. A couple of sections are not as clear as they could be but overall a very good book.
5,Fine story,"This is the first in a trilogy of excellent books that focus on a Klingon infiltrator aboard the USS Enterprise. Not being a fan of Klingon-heavy Star Trek stories, I began reading the work expecting it to be the usual, run-of-the-mill stuff. I am pleased to say that this was not the case at all.The book (and its two siblings) are simply excellent. The Klingon infiltrator finds himself in a security position, facing harsh dangers alongside human security personnel. Fans of ""space battle Star Trek"" and ""developed character Star Trek"" will both be more than satisfied with the story.Trust me, you will not be disappointed."
5,One of the Best TOS books,"Book 1 was an awesome read. I had to read it in one sitting. The character development was excellent, the story was engrossing, seeing things from the Klingon spy Kell's point of view and contrasting it to Starfleet Ensign West's was great, there was just the right mix of lower decks characters and regulars. It has everything it needed to make it a great success. I highly recommend this book"
4,Simple Solution for Our Workplace Security,Use these throughout our Assisted Living Building to provide controlled access to public restrooms. Also use outside our training rooms to make controls simple and certain.
4,Perfect Solution,"I installed this Key Safe in my new home and it has proven to be the perfect solution for placing a key outside my home. My home has handles that lock on the inside, but still allow you to open the door, if you don't check to make sure the handle is in the un-locked position before you exit, you will be locked out. It has also been handy for giving contractors access to the house when needed. It was super easy to install, very heavy duty metal construction. Others have complained about the key coming off the base, I have not encountered that problem. I am very satisfied with this product."
3,The Felony: a B movie is so bad it's a hoot!,"The Felony is a great movie for action-film genre buffs who don't take the concept too seriously. Make no mistake - this is a B film with bad acting, directing, dialog, etc., but myself and another independent tester laughed until we cried watching this wonderful dog of a movie. The Felony has everything - explosions, car chases, buddy cops, bad girls, guns, corruption, and a reluctant hero. Of course, there is the ubiquitous ""incriminating item"" that all the main characters are willing to kill to get - this time, it's a video tape. This movie also has all your favorite not-quite-famous actors like Leo Rossi, Joe Don Baker, Charles Napier, and my personal favorite, Lance Henriksen. You'll get a kick out of picking them out, and glad that they found work. Jeffrey Combs is at his mugging best here. Buy this video! But make sure you watch it with some buddies and a 6 pack, and be prepared to guffaw. END"
1,Making and Selling this Movie Should be a Felony,"Felony is a terrible movie. The writing is illogical, the directing is choppy and disjointed, and the acting is awful, with one exception. The camera work looks like a poorly done television production. The special effects are amateurish and outlandish with slow moving cars suddenly flipping and flying through the air from a single gun shot defying all physics or reason.How someone gave this mess a 5 star rating is beyond me. Save your money and buy almost any other movie. This is like an badly made porn movie without the nudity. It truly is beyond bad."
5,great heater,I have had one of these heaters for about 5 years and until this spring it has worked great. I am having trouble with it now and am looking to buy another one but we do not have them in the stores now that spring is here.
3,Just as good as any,"I have very dry and curly hair and I have tried nearly every product available to make sleek, silky curls. This is just as good as every other silicon-based hair product from Biosilk, Aveda, Paul Mitchell, or even Pantene and Paul Frieda. Sigh. I need some sort of miracle in a bottle."
3,oily,"I bought it because there were many positive reviews about it, very expensive compare to small volume, and it is basically oil, might be light oil, so I guess for me was not anything specific or magic, very usual product, don't waste your money for such a small volume product."
3,BUMBLE and BUMBLE de frizzer,"i have the crazy curly hair and am always looking for the magic potion.this comes close, the day you wear it it works really nicely for curls....but the next day my hair feels stiff and kind of greasy.... those of you that have the curly, curly hair know that our hair tends to be on the dry side, so it's hard to wash it everyday-- and not make it worse...... anyway, if you know that going in-- it's a great product! you don't have to use very much AT ALL."
2,Made my hair even MORE frizzy than before I used it...bummer,"Well, I really was excited to receive this item because I've always heard great things about the Bumble and Bumble line of hair products. But I was quite disappointed when I used it. Instead of defrizzing my hair, it somehow made my hair more frizzy than ever and there was certainly no shine to be seen through all that frizz. I have fine hair and my hair frizzes very easily most of the time, but especially when it's humid. I'd think a defrizz product would do the defrizzing like it says. I can't see why my hair type should matter. But I tried it several times during humid and non-humid days and my hair still didn't smoothen for me...frizzed away... So I can't recommend it...I can't understand why there's so much hype about this product. Maybe it's their shampoo/conditioner line that's actually worthy of a good rating, but certainly not the defrizz product."
2,Pricey for little outcome,"I bought this product in hopes my hair would look a little bit more 'finished' after straightening, curling, etc. However, every time I use it, I keep looking at the mirror wondering if it actually DID anything. And it's frustrating that I spent more than 20.00 on a small bottle of a product that I really have to wonder is actually doing anything. It could be olive oil for all I know, because it really hasn't made a difference.Would recommend looking elsewhere."
4,original good rockin tonight,"Before Elvis and Wynonie sang it.....this was the writer of this classic piece. Some great shouting rock and roll songs. Sang before their was Rock & Roll. Now you know what the term referred to=sex. These guys started it all before Elvis. Drinkin' and ""banging"" I bet Elvis was listening to them though and knew their names. Most white folks weren't allowed to listen to this ""Devil's music"". Professor Longhair and Fats Domino's co-writer Dave Bartholomew songs are somewhat scratchy and dated. Some cuts good though."
1,Country Legends Live,"Absolute rubbish. Poor quality, old performances, typical Time Life. Same goes for Country Legends Live 2 & 3. Sorry i bought these items."
3,"Short, not the best selection of performers or songs...","The DVD was rather short, and the selection of performers didn't really appeal to me personally. Also the song choices of the performers I do enjoy were lackluster. But with that being said, it wasn't awful. The quality was decent, and the outrageous 80's hair-dos and fashions were entertaining."
3,"ZVOX 315 Nice, when it works.","I bought this unit to use as a sound system for laptop PC DVD viewing and iPod listening on the road. It is an extremely adaptable unit for anything with mini-jack or RCA outputs. Sound is very good for what it is, that is , a portable faux-surround sound all-in-one system. Unfortunately, after 1 initial use I put it away for 6 months and when trying to use it again it failed to work. I had to pay almost half of the initial purchase price to get it repaired (I suspect ZVOX just sent a replacement unit). It is too bad that such an innovative product suffers from such a high failure rate. Check eBay to see how many of these units are up for sale with the ""no audio"" or ""good for parts"" caveat attached. Great when it works, ZVOX needs to address the high failure rate and check their quality control before I would straight out purchase another product from them."
4,The Feminist Wars Revisted,"Thank you. What a pleasure to finally read an honest and balanced account of a very misunderstood time from a participant in the struggle. Chesler clearly understands that the most direct route to converting non-believers is to acknowledge that, at times, we all have our flaws and weaknesses. It obviously took a tremendous amount of courage to take an unpopular stand back then and this book really brings that difficult time to life; a pleasure to read."
5,"The Author, The Subject and The Book Rocked My World","I heard Dr. Phyllis Chesler present this material at the 'Association For Research On Mothering and Mamapalooza' Conference in NYC. She spoke to a packed room of feminists of every age, from 19 -80 years old. Each of us were forced to confront this subject with honest, open eyes and this book is a MUST READ for women looking to turn the tables on what has gone before and what must come next. It's a smart read and I hope women everywhere will pick it up and learn these lessons so we can move forward - Finally - Please! Bravo once again Phyllis."
2,"Yuck, but my wife enjoys it",if your interested in watching a woman whine like a little kid this might be the show for you. I think my wife likes to watch it just to enjoy someone else go through pain.
2,This episode is not good,"This episode is disappointing, as well as the trajectory of the series. We never delve into any complexity into mindy's character. We got a great first episode and after that she's been the same.Mindy portrays herself as a complete ditz and dissappoints everyone by continuing to ply into dbag manipultation tactics. With every ""How am I going to keep a man?"" moment mindy's character looses respect. It seems like she settles for so little and has no strong characteristics of her own. What a weak leading lady."
5,One of my favorite new shows,I love this show. Mindy's character is relatable and just wants love in her life. Praying its renewed for a 2nd season
5,Love the Mindy Project!,"This show is very funny and has a realistic view of women. We are vibrant, flawed and wise all at the same time. This show reminds you of Ally McBeal and Greys Anatomy but it has a dash of uniqueness that only Mindy Kaling can bring. Enjoy!"
5,"Mindy Kaling, Richard Schiff, some clean cut version of Russel Brandt, and a cameo(?) by Bill Hader. I'm in love.",I'm basing my rating on the Pilot episode which is really one of the funniest things I've seen on TV in a while. Just bought a season pass.
3,Its okay,"Funny at first, but got old and did not keep my interest. So it is a three stars kind of things, meaning ""its okay."""
4,"Cute Seat, not really a bouncer, tho","I got this as a hand-me-down,so... I wanted this seat so that my 2 yr old could share the new baby's toys (jealousy, you know). My toddler LOVES it! She loves anything with fish, of course:) But, she really likes to sit in it, likes the music, thinks the vibrations are funny, is enamoured with the toys.But, I guess when I read rocker, I imagined it rocking the baby sort of like a swing. That's not what this does, it simply can rock back and forth when the kick stand is down. However, it really doesn't do that on the carpet, it's pretty stationary. And it doesn't have bouncy wires like a bouncy seat. It's not really flexible like a bouncy, it's very sturdy. So, I'll update on the seat when the new baby comes. But, for now, I'd say this is a cute seat, but I don't think I'd pay the full price just for a seat. Maybe if I had more money:)"
4,Nice Rocker,"I was looking for a rocker that would grow with my child. There were two, the Fisher Price Infant to Toddler Rocker and this Baby Einstein Discovering Water Rocker. Both can take weights up to 40lbs. However, the Baby Einstien has an outlet that you can attach an Ipod/MP3 player and play all kinds of music for your baby. So I purchased this one. Ironically, the IPOD/MP3 outlet was the first and only thing to break on this rocker and that upset me because it was one of the main reasons for purchase. The baby still enjoys the rocker for its vibrating mode and soft music which puts him right to sleep."
3,Good but not great,"I had this baby seat and also the baby papasan by Fisher Price (which I loved). This seat was way too big for my baby until he was 6 months old so he was in the papasan until he out grew it. Like previous reviewers have noted, the toys are not firmly locked into the base and can come out with an easy tug. I also have to mention that I wish that the vibration unit has a timer. It turns on easily when bumped on and have been left on unintentionally countless times and even for sometimes a whole day until I hear the buzzing noise (wasted many batteries)! Now that my son is crawling, he does go to the seat and try to sit in it by himself. I rate it a 3 star (average) because the pluses are I like the music and the vibration. The minuses are the toys come off easily, it's a little big for infants, and there is no timer for the vibration unit. Overall I do like the seat but I'm sure there are better ones out there."
3,"With the good, comes the bad","For the most part I am pleased with this seat. It was slightly difficult to put together because the pieces aren't labeled at all, and you have to refer to the picture on the box to get certain things accomplished as a result. The toy bar is great and is keeping my little one amused, but the octopus will NOT stay put! All it is, is a plastic peg that you stuff into a hole. My son tugged on the vibrating pull leg, and smacked himself in the face when the toy came free. I think the seat is a great idea, especially when it comes to all the features, but they should really work on the packaging/design. Label the parts and make the toys a little more secure- and then it'll be perfect."
3,NOT SURE ABOUT TOYS AND VIBRATIONS,"ALTHOUGH I DO LIKE THE FEATURES, THE MUSIC, MP3 COMPATABILITY, AND ROCKER, I AM UNSURE OF THE TOY BARS. THEY FALL OFF PRETTY EASILY AND WHEN MY 2-MONTH OLD IS STRONGER, I WILL BE CONCERNED FOR HER SAFETY. I ALSO THINK IT VIBRATES A BIT TOO HARD FOR A YOUNGER INFANT, MAYBE BEYOND 4 MONTHS. MY BABY IS PETITE SO I THINK THE VIBRATIONS ARE TOO JARRING. I KEEP TRYING IT. I AM HOPING AS SHE GROWS SHE IS MORE COMFORTABLE IN IT."
3,Ok but a little boring and loud vibration noise.,"Well I fell into the hype of this baby seat. I love the way it looks and the fact that it goes up to 40 pounds which is alot better than the Fisher Price Aquarium bouncer, but the price is a little high and the vibration is very loud. My husband tried to make it stop by tightening the screws that hold the vibration unit but that didn't help much. The toys seem a little out of my son's reach at this point. He is 2 1/2 months old. I guess overall it is an ok seat but I think that this seat really needs some improvements."
4,Worth the Money,"I have purchased Baby Einstein products before so I expected nothing but the best out of this bouncy seat. My newborn son, now 4 months old, didn't like our previous Einstein bouncy seat that our daughter enjoyed so I went searching for something new. He was a preemie so he didn't like the upright seat of the regular bouncers and preferred to lay back just a little. He absolutely LOVES this seat!! It reclines just enough for him to sit comfortably in it, yet sits up enough for him to play. He has taken numerous naps listening to the nature sounds all while he vibrates. My 18 month old also loves this seat, and she too has taken a few naps in it being that it's so comfy. The only thing I would improve are the toys and the chair's rocking ability. The octopus falls out entirely too easy and is completely out of reach for an infant. The chair also doesn't rock enough to soothe a fussy baby. Other than that, I think i'm getting every penney's worth out of this chair."
2,Returned it,"We ordered this seat for our 5 month old son to use at his caregiver's house. It looked roomy and entertaining. However, when we assembled it and put him in there, he was able to yank out the toy bar with one yank. Every time I'd replace it and try to put it in tighter, he could still pull it out, sometimes knocking the toys in his face. Our dog was even able to knock it out by just nudging the bar with her nose. Overall, it just didn't seem safe and didn't hold his attention for long. Plus it's overpriced. I much prefer his initial (and much cheaper) seat, the Fisher Price Infant to Toddler Rocker (you can hang other toys and links off the bar and it stays put)."
1,The worst shipment I ever received from Amazon,"Shoppers beware:The item itself is a great item but I have received the worst shipment ever from my online orders:1-Even though the item is advertised in Amazon as new, I received an item which was previously used and apparently for a long long time. The rocker seat was dirty and smelled.2-Even though the seller charges more than 9 dollars for shipping, they did not bother to put the manufacturer fragile box in a mailing box. Therefore the package arrived cut in several locations with some of the items bulging out.3-Some of the accessories are missing and I can bet the previous owner forgot to return them !"
1,Buyer Beware,"I received this seat as a gift, and unfortunately I can't return it.The seat is much to big for a baby, it does not rock, and the music is too quiet and mostly all I can hear is static.The toys are boring and unreachable."
1,Not worth it,"Well, it was good for about 5 weeks after that it just died. No battery replacement would bring this baby back to life. At least I got to keep the arm band.Save your money."
3,navman times 8,"This makes the 8th (eighth) Navman I have purchased in as many years. I buy them for my wife for her hobby,horseback riding. They only last a year so warranty does not help. Also trying to register them is so hard it's almost not worth it, They don't include a warranty card in their paperwork and the website is a dead end.Also no phone number to call to register. I wish I could find another product like it that she could use. If you have any suggestions please let me know."
2,Save your money,"I received this GPS as a gift. After the first few weeks, the display went bad and it no longer shows my speed or distance. Nothing works to change the display anymore. I would invest in something more worthwhile. It was a waste of good friends money!"
4,It just went bad.,"I bought two, one for me and one for my girlfriend.That was over five years ago. Mine just went bad. My (ex)gitlfriend bought a more expensive GPS and now is going to give me her W300 (thats what it was called then).When it goes bad I will buy a more expensive GPS.But over 5 years of constant use isn't bad."
4,The end of Apple TV,"This software worked immediately with both my PS3 and DirecTV HR21. UPnP is exactly as advertised. Install the software, and it works. All of my iPhoto albums and iTunes playlists were immediately available and accessible form my MacPro. WOW! Accessing VIDEO_TS folders is still a bit buggy, and my only reason for not giving five stars. This can only get better. Cheaper from the developer, but worth every penny."
2,Requires more work to get service or repairs...,"I purchased our Karcher powerwasher and was initially very pleased. It worked great! But after four or five uses, the motor quit working. Each time I used it, we had to coax it along because the powerwasher kept tripping our GFI outlets. We called the 1-800 number provided and were referred to a repair location that no longer works on Karchers. Too bad this product has so many problems..."
1,Not good service from Karcher,"I bought a Karcher K397M probably over a year ago now. It worked great, then the hose got a hole after about 6 uses. (Some people tell me this is because the hose rubs against itself while in operation.) I have contacted Karcher and they keep INSISTING that I buy a replacement hose for $61.00 that definitely WILL NOT fit this washer. I think they changed the setup because the hose for the smaller unit with 1400 PSI would fit, but I asked them if they thought this was a safe procedure and they never answered!! The hose they keep trying to sell me definitely WILL NOT work! Will never buy a Karcher again and advise anyone else not to."
1,Plastic,"Poorly engineered, or perhaps ingenious engineering?Well, I'm fairly certain that Karcher doesn't make their money selling machines, but selling parts. There are several weak spots that seem to be built in to this machine.The hose attachment is plastic and a huge weak point. It does not seal well, and when it does, it eventually springs a leak.The hose: Way too light. The hose seems to be made of dripper lines(?). The hose is far too thin. It kinks. It does not like to be brushed against cement or bricks. It scuffs way too easily making the weak point even worse.The handle: Leaks like a waterhose. They had me order replacement parts. First order was wrong, wouldn't return shipping and handling. 2nd did not fix the problem.The plug: GFI plug rusted and eventually needed replacing. I was able to replace, not with OEM.I'm sure I'll recall other problems I've had with this unit. This machine is a money pit. Less than an hour of use.-AVOID KARCHER- Spend a little more and get a quality machine."
1,Poorest excuse for customer service ever,"Karcher sells a what I thought to be a nice electric pressure washer. After 4 months of use, water started to gush out of the inside whenever the hose was turned on. That, however, is just one aspect of the problem.Their customer service for ""Rapid Exchange"" requires proof in the form of your credit card statement faxed to them in order to send a new unit, as well as a laborious phone call.Just save yourself the time, hassle, and headache. Don't buy anything Karcher, as you will regret it. They clearly manufacture cheap goods and then provide terrible customer service to boot."
5,Perfect book for Newborns and Infants,Bought this book when my son was a little over 2 months. Wish I had bought it sooner! Didn't know he'd enjoy it so much. We use it daily for tummy time and play time. He loves it!
5,The only book she'll pay attention to,"My daughter loves this book from the day I bought it (at age 1 month). She really focuses on the imagery. Out of the gazillion books I have showed her, she likes this one the best."
5,Our Favorite Toy,Our son has loved this book from the time he was 4 weeks old. He studies each page for minutes on end. It's a great way to introduce your child to the world of reading.
4,good for infants,I've had this or similar for my grandchildren. I bought it based on experience and informed by my field of cognitive neuropsychology.
2,Not a big hit,"My son looked at it a few times but was not interested. The book is small, thin and cheap. Do not waste your money."
1,Concern with Stock,"We ordered this book and it arrived damaged. No issues with returning it, but they sent a replacement that was also damaged. We are not sure whether we are going to bother asking for another replacement or just return the thing and be happy we have the rest in the series. Given the price for the most basic of board books we really do expect to receive a product that is undamaged."
4,A Great Book for Baby,This is now a standard item in the diaper bag I take to church with my 2-month old. The designs capture his attention and entertain him quite well.
5,TERRIFIC,My 8 week old granddaughter loved it. She would get antimated when looking at it. Sometimes she would coo and smile. Great book.Grandma.
5,2 day old loved it!,"When my granddaughter was 2 days old, we pulled out this book that we had purchased for her. She looked intently at the pages, esp. the fish page and scanned them left to right and up and down for a considerable length of time. The illustrations are bold and graphic which is perfect for a newborn. It is solely in black and white with the exception of a small amount of red lettering. The size is good for a newborn and since it is a board book, it can be stood up and propped open beside the baby. The only thing that would make it even better is if it were made as an accordion fold book."
5,Great book!,"My 2-month-old baby LOVES this book. She just stares and smiles at it. So glad I bought it, and I plan to buy it as a gift for others."
5,SO cute!,"This is a great book full of simple and complex black and white (and red) images for baby. I love too that it isn't just images, but also has text on each page that makes it more like a normal book. I will buy this book again for baby showers."
5,excellent for young baby,"It has eye-catching images of smiling faces in black on white, white on black. Our three month old grandson found it mesmerizing."
2,Save Your Money,"My newborn was not at all interested in this book. I tried to get him interested up until he was 3 months old. By 3 months he was interested in colorful books and I have since lost this book. Also, after purchasing this book, I found that you can print similar black and white images from the internet. I should have saved my money."
4,So far so good,"It may be too soon to tell, but my one week old certainly seems mesmerized by the images in this book. And I enjoy feeling that she's being stimulated by something other than nursing, pooping, and sleeping."
5,My baby would rather read this book then play with a toy,"This was the first book my newborn saw. She was probably only a week old when we first showed it to her and we were amazed at how she looked at each page. She especially lingered on the pages with faces. She is five months old now and it is her favorite book. She gets excited when she sees it and will actually choose to look at the book over playing with a toy. Imagine that! A child choosing a book over a toy!! We have other black and white board books too, but this is her favored book. I'm glad I read the reviews before purchasing this book because it was well worth it. It will now become a gift item I give to all expectant parents."
4,My baby likes it,Nice black and white pictures on thick cardboard style paper.My 5 month old baby enjoys looking at it - it's the point I suppose.
2,No what I expected,"Knife was much bigger than I anticipated (which is not the fault of the product), but it was also obvious that the quality of the handle was no the best, especially considering the price. I returned and I'm going with another brand."
2,Awkward and dangerous,"The 10 inch version of this knife is awkward to handle, and dangerous to use. The balance point is somewhere in the middle of the blade, rather than where one would normally grip a knife. Yes it's sharp, but so are the cheap hollow ground blades you find at low end retailers.I have cooked professionally as well as doing home cooking, so I'm not a stranger to using a knife. I find this particular knife unusable, and I am returning it."
3,"Ok for price, much better options out there","Like many others, I bought this based on the reviews. The blade is nice and stiff, but the handle is not attached very well to the blade. When I try to lightly bend the blade, I can hear a little creaking noise... kinda scary when you're trying to put some heavy duty use on it..."
1,Victorinox messed-up! - can't slice a tomato,"Well, as far as I know Victorinox should have been the best knifes out on the market. So I picked up this one and started with the simple ""tomato test"" the knife failed! moved to the cucumbers and things got even worst, everything sticks to this knife.There is no way that I will give it any stars (but must to give it 1)"
5,Nothing can compare in price!,"Within my job being a Chef, and an undergraduate Culinary Student you have to have great knifes. It is madatory, it's like a mechanic without his tools. I searched and searched for months before my lab class started so I could find the right knifes etc. Oh boy, I was first going with another few, but they were so expensive. I got 2 for the price of one. I currently own two of these exact 10""inch, I bought one for my co-worker for Fathers day. Also I haveVictorinox 47547 10-1/4-Inch Wavy Bread Knife, Black Fibrox Handle, andVictorinox Cutlery 6-Inch Curved Boning Knife, Blue Fibrox Handle with Microbantoo. Which, with 7+ months of school, and 50+ hours working a week, I haven't had to sharpen the bread knife. The 10""inch does get dull when working on harder things to cut, like watermelon, etc. But once you sharpen it, it cuts through tomatoes like a BRAND NEW knife would.Definitely recommend it. My Executive Chef (30+ years exp)even bought him some new ones too."
3,Good for a lefty,It's a good long knife and the price was very fair. The big problems is that as a lefty I need a knife that can cut on both sides. Too often I have ordered a fancy knife and did not notice that the bias of the blade was for a right handed person and had to ship it right back.
4,Great but could've been better,"Out of the box, this knife was extremely sharp! after using it a few times, the knife was really easy to use and felt great while in use. The handle seems very ergonomic and very well made. However, i did notice it getting quite dull after a week of use even with the proper care."
4,Sharp but needs care,"Out of the box (like with any knife) this one is sharp as anything!!! I've cut through my nails a few times, easily.. however we've had it for about a month and it's had a lot of use so I think it's sharpening time. I was hoping they'd last a little longer between sharpening. This knife is a perfect knife for carving and shopping. The handle is pretty generic with not much grip, but the blade itself is slender and very appealing. I purchased it after Lifehacker suggested it as being equivalent to those $100 chef knifes, so far.. so good, but not perfect."
5,FORE!!!,"This knife is awesome! I second every 5 star rating on this knife (and I read them all before I decided) Its only been one day and I have been chopping and slicing every piece of food in sight. Razor sharp, feels hefty,fits perfect in my hand(im a bigger handed person)the grip is truly no slip (cut about three wet/washed celery bunches and a chicken today). I don't know what else to say... As a former avid golfer who had a baby and has had to give up the sport for a while so I took up cooking instead kinda guy...this is like getting a new 500 dollar driver for 75 bucks...and this one is supposed to slice! From the first time I picked it up I knew it fit and I found the sweet spot right away. I'll update down the road after more than one day but seriously...its really nice."
5,"Incredible value for the amount of knife you get, one of the best cutlery values anywhere","I own almost exclusively Forschner Fibrox knives now, since discovering the line a few years back, these replacing our antiquated set of Chicago Cutlery walnut knives. Heft and balance are spot-on perfect, and the blade is very thin for a western-style knife. The blade is nice and flexible, and the handle is very comfortable and easy to keep a hold on. Of the 10 Forschner Fibrox knives and 3 Japanese knives I own, this is my go-to knife for cutting large vegetable items such as cabbage and watermelon. Came pretty sharp out of the box, tuned it up with my diamond sharpener. Edge retention is pretty good, although not as good as my VG-10 Tojiro knives. However, Tojiro costs 4-5 times as much as Forschner, and little extra honing on the steel makes up for it just fine. This is a great knife!"
5,A Definite Winner,"I've had this knife for several years now and it's one of my 2 favorites. I,in fact, have 2 of them, one in the house and one in our RV.This knIfe has an excellent blade that sharpens well (I use an Edgepro sharpener) and maintains that edge over time. I have a set of Cutco and some Chicago Cutlery knives and none of them compare with the Forschner. I have several different Forschner knives and all of them are excellent. You'd have to spend considerably more to find a comparable knife. My other favorite, by the way, is a handmade chef's knife crafted by a fellow in Oregon from old sawmill saw blades. A wonderful, hefty knife. Try a Forschner, you won't be sorry."
4,Nice buy,For my first knife (that I did not get from work) it is nice the main thing to do is put a good edge on it. Then keep it sharp with dimond steel I have been using it for a few weeks and it stays sharp for a few days but I use it all the time as a cook
4,Victorinox 10in,"Very sharp, easy to grip when wet, and not too heavy. I really like this knife for the money."
4,short and sharp,Since I received this knife it has become the go to knife for most of my kitchen work. It is really sharp and great for cutting tomatoes and other soft fruits and veggies.
5,great no-frills solid knife,I really like this knife. nothing fancy here. Just stable steel blade and a grip that's ergonomically comfortable and not slippery. A workhorse in the kitchen.
4,"A brilliant knife - if you're looking for sharp, here it is","The knife feels stable and safe due to the best handle I've experienced.Beautiful sharp, clean cut.I'd recommend this knife to anyone who enjoys using high quality tools."
5,best of the best,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST KNIFES THAT THE SHARPNESS OF THE KNIFE WILL LAST FOR A MONTH! I USED THESE KNIFES WHEN I WAS BUTCHER FOR A LOCAL HEB STORE. IN MY OPINION AND FOR PEOPLE THAT KNOWS ABOUT KNIFES THESE ARE ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BEST... GLOBAL IS JUST THE BRAND YOU ARE BUYING THEY ARE THE SAME AS FAR AS QUALITY.
5,10 inch Chefs Knife,"Very sharp, and nicely Balanced, Love to make soup, Works great for cutting all my ingredients. Very nice Knife for the Kitchen."
5,WHAT A KNIFE!,"THIS IS ALL YOU WILL NEED WHEN IT IS TIME TO CARVE YOUR TURKEY OR ROAST!!!!!! I bought it when I realized the electric knives we had been using just didn't "" cut it."""
4,Good blade for the price,"I have been wanting to try a Victorinox blade for awhile due to the good reviews from Cook's Illustrated and I have been missing a 10"" chef's knife so I gave this one a whirl. I thought the blade would be a lot more flimsy than it is, it's pretty rigid. Holds a good edge as long as you use a steel often. Only thing I don't really like about it is the edges of the blade on top are kind of sharp. I usually hold the handle and pinch the blade for control when cutting and it can be a little uncomfortable compared to my Henckels."
4,R.H. Forschner by Victorinox 10-Inch Chef's Knife,"This knife was recommended by America's Test Kitchen (love, love, love the cookbooks, web page & show). The knife was inexpensive, so I bought it. It is gigantic! Good for cutting large fruit (watermelon, pineapple, etc.) Very sharp and wonderful to use. I will be ordering the 8-in for smaller items. I liked it so much, I bought one as a gift for my sister-in-law."
4,Great value for home cooks,"Let me preface by saying I do not own a dozen high ends knives, nor am I any longer a professional cook. I did work for several casual dining chains as a line cook, and have done my fair of high volume prep work, and my wife and I tend to host the big holiday dinners because I'm a pretty good cook, but I am no chef. For $30, this knife is a great value. I probably use it about 10-15 minutes per day for making dinner etc, and it has held its edge very well for the last 6 months with regular use of a honing steel. I enjoy the longer blade for it's extra leverage, and the light weight and firm grip keep you from getting tired when doing a fine julienne. It's not life changing, unless your only knives are cheap department store wedding gift specials. This is just a fairly inexpensive, durable, easy to use tool for making food."
5,Good basic knife,"Garden-variety bachelor here. I've have this knife for almost two years, and it's served me well. Large enough to cut well, easy to grip, easy to clean, inexpensive. I have not ever sharpened it and it still cuts nicely; although not as well as when I first got it. I'd recommend this anyone who just needs a knife for basic cooking."
4,Awesome knife.,"This knife is great and the sharpness is unbelievable. I cut my finger cutting up some onions but glad I didn't cut the whole tip. I hope I don't have to sharpen the knife too often. On top of the knife I bought the transparent blade cover also. For $30 for both, that's a great deal."
5,Great Rockabilly!,The playing and singing are what it's all about. This is why Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps are so great!
3,A highlreadable historical account of the Fetterman Massacre,"The work bears all the earmarks of ""good history"". As a fictionalized account of the Sioux uprising of the 1866 period it is a quick read and a very pleasant ""page-turner"". If you are interested in the history of the opening of the west, but don't want to plow through the more dry versions offered by history books, this is the work for you. If the book has any faults, it is that the central character, an Irish immigrant, by the name of Donegan, is presented as larger than life. This is a small criticism as Donegan does not terribly often dominate center stage and the rest of the characters are more ""realistic"" in their presentation. After reading this work you will probably want to purchase more of Johnston's books. He is a fine writer and does write good history."
3,Enjoyable read,"This historically accurate novel about the initial stages of the war between the U. S. army and the plains Indians (the Sioux, Cheyennes, and Arapahos) is an enjoyable read. Nearly all the characters are names out of the history books (Crazy Horse, Red Cloud, Henry Carrington, William Fetterman, etc.) with one big exception. Seamus Doonegan, ex-army sergeant, is a fictitious and likeable rogue (although possibly a tad too John Wayne-ish). As a student of Native American history, I was left somewhat wanting for a clearer view of the Indian side of the tale, but that aside I'd recommend this book. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series."
5,Second pair. Love them.,Sharp and tough. Fit my hand and very comfortable to used. I used these non stop in December for installing car audio and alarms and they still fill like new.
4,"GREAT STRIPERS , .DO NOT CUT SCREWS WITH","THEY ARE GREAT STRIPERS WHEN THEY ARE NEW ,VERY SHARP AND SMOOTH,THE PROBLEM I HAD IS WHEN TRIED TO CUT 8/32 SCREWS THEY CAME LOOSE AND THEY WOULD OVERBITE BESIDES THAT THEY ARE Great,THIS IS THE ONLY STRIPPERS I USE AND THEY ARE WELL MADE,ONE GREAT PRODUCT BY KLEIN AS LONG AS U DO NOT CUT SCREWS WITH"
2,good tool for a while,"I got a good tool from klein and my only complaint is that the cutter does not work as well as it should. It will cut wire with insulation still on it but it won't cut bare stranded wire (16awg) very well without jamming between the blades sometimes.UPDATE 23 Dec - I got this tool to rewire a 1985 porsche targa. It has barely made it. I finished the car yesterday and I think this tool is finished too. Besides the problems mentioned in my initial review it is now very difficult to strip wires with this thing, maybe its dull now, who knows who cares. I am surprised because Klein makes good stuff. Maybe I got a dud but I won't buy another klein to find out."
3,they're a little defective,"they work well in many areas but cutting down 6-32 screws is not one of them. i got two sets and both cross threaded the end of my screw everytime, with out fail."
5,Understanding Orgaizational Evolution,"John PetasAmerican HondaWithout having read this book, I would not have grasped the big picture; lacking an understanding of the concepts expressed herein, I would have focused on my MBO's and the tasks at hand. Now, I believe I understand centralization and decentralization, how to push decision making down to the lowest level, and how not to get caught up in the data. These efficiencies have given me the ability to operate in a large corporate environment with all of the agility and values of a small business."
4,Understanding Orgaizational Evolution,"Understanding Organizational Evolution is a unique combination of practical management advice and deep insight into the underlying reasons for organizational problems. Fletcher and Taplin provide concrete lessons and symptoms of the need for organizational change from their evolutionary model of organizations that help managers understand exactly what particular problems mean and how to address them. What is more, their inclusion of a history of teamwork's success and failures sheds insight and explanation that is all too rare in practical management books. Their use of numerous specific cases and examples, and emphasis on using information technology for performance management make this book ideal for MBA and Executive Education courses in management and leadership."
3,Shrug,"I don't know what to say. I was ecstatic to find my purchase of this product in the mail today, and I was very eager to sit down at the piano and play. I'm a little disappointed that this songbook is much like most songbooks out there. It doesn't stand out a whole lot. The melody is written in the accompaniment, but when I select music, I prefer accompaniment that sounds original, not a duplicate of what's being sung. It seems distracting.I am however pleased that everything was kept in their original key signature as far as I can tell, even if that makes it harder for some to play. The graphics are a nice addition, and I am very satisfied with the number of songs included in this songbook.So, on that note, I still absolutely love RENT, and I am sure I will continue to. Maybe my expectations were too high? I'm not sure, but maybe it would be a good idea if a version of this songbook were released with the original accompaniment."
4,"The score reflects the Movie, not the broadway version","As true to the movie score and music. Does not include all the songs that are in the broadway show, but good enough for all the songs I loved to sing along to, and the piano pieces are more for intermediate to advance, and less so for beginners."
4,"Good, could sound better, like they do live, these days","Seems like a collection of singles. Don't own any of them, but the sound is pretty consistent, so assume they were rerecorded for this album. The Mass Extintion Council. Ever wonder what that means. The slip cover validates their reasoning behind every song on the album. Simply excellent!"
2,I know there are better books out there,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. Being a late bloomer to driving -raised in NYC. I read Zen and the Art of Motorcylce maintenance and I wanted this book to go into detail on Zen and driving. It gave a lot of general philosphy of Zen and some on driving. I wanted details , and more details. He did have a few real life examples but very superficial. Its not bad but if you want some meat look elsewhere."
3,Emergency Dispatch,This book offers examples of several types of questions with sample tests. It would better serve the reader to be a little less wordy and offer a few more testing examples.
3,Dissappointed,"In my case, the test that was administered was not even close to what is in this book. I completed the testing on a computer with a headset.The items were shipped in a timely manner."
3,Family Game,"This game is good for family to sit down and enjoy.The game is short but challenging on the higher levels.Questions anywhere from shapes,drawing misc shapes to naming historical monuments etc."
1,No good,I bought this item and I literally hate it. They make it seem so simple and easy but the blade does not do a good job in removing water from car surfaces. I would only recommend it for doing windows. Much easier to use chamois or regular old terrycloth towels.
1,California Water Blade,I didn't receive it. I received a cover for a microwave plate. I will be returning it.
3,Good but could be better,"If you've never used a water blade (squeegee) to dry your car, your in for a treat.The 12"" blade I got worked good. In fact, so good, somebody at work stole it!I stopped at a local auto supply store and they had something similar but with asofter silicon blade and gel grip handle.The softer blade removed more water than the plastic blade andthe gel grip was more comfortable than the hard plastic grip.The larger sizes are too stiff to be effective but the 8"" and 12"" are ok.If your using it for personal use, the CWB will be fine.As a professional, I require a little more from my equipment.Rated: 3 1/2 stars"
5,California Water Blade,Great time saver for drying your car. Clean your shower after daily use. Excellent for cleaning windows with ammonia.
5,California Car Blade,Works great on our clears shower doors. No scratching. Best we have found by far.
4,California Water Blade,"This device removes 90% of the water more effeciently than any other product I've yet used. The problem is it does not do a very good job on those sections of the auto which have curved surfaces. On those surfacesyou will need to use whatever it was that you had been using. I'm certain that over time one will grow more proficient with this tool and clear perhaps 95% of the standing water, leaving only a small amount of water to be removed by conventional means. All in all I am happy with this product."
5,Makes fast work of drying my SUV!,"I tried this for the first time last night and WOW! Drying my full size SUV was a breeze. VERY fast, VERY thorough, and actually fun to use. My kids were arguing about who got to use it next. It takes a bit of getting used to, but by the end of the job, I was a pro.Now, you're not going to get EVERY drop of water off, but you'll get 90% of it off and can quickly wipe up the rest with a chamois or microfiber towel.I'll probably be washing my vehicles more often now that I have this beauty to help me out!"
1,unusable,"This cd-rom is twelve years old and not compatable with the newer Windows operating system. The makers of the product said it has been off the market for over two years, and were surprised I could even buy it anywhere. On the positive side, Amazon happily refunded my money even though the software packaging had been opened. Also, if you happened to have an older computer, the content does look really interesting."
5,whoa,"This book was off the chain. I am not doing to go into a long drawn out review, but I will tell you this is a good a#% book and I can't wait to read the next one. FIVE STARS!!"
4,Great read!,I enjoyed this book very much. I didn't start at the beginning of the series as my library only had this one and the next. I don't know Jaylin's backstory with Scorpio but I enjoyed reading about her and Shane. Scorpio is a mess and I'm not sure what to think of her. This was a great quick read and I'm glad I at least have the conclusion of this story. I can't wait to read what happens next.
1,Beware,"Well lets see, instructions make no mention of why installed head is so different from others or how to install spring so annoying from the get go. But I would have to say my biggest complaint is that thi simply does work at all. A total POS"
1,"use it as a hammer, that's all its good for","I returned the first one I ordered because it was crap. This one is even worse, you got to fight with it to grip the rivet and that's not rightnot worth it"
2,Worked great.... Until:,"I've had a tough time finding a great rivet gun locally (Small community in SE Alaska)... So I ordered a gun labeled with one of my favorite household tool brand names.I put it to the test... started off immediately with 3/16 stainless pop rivets on a project. It did great... not a lot of leverage though. It performed great until the handle broke. Literally, the handle broke in half in the middle of the rivet... The metal appeared porous and cheap. I hope it's a fluke for the rest of you. But It's going into my drawer full of incompetent rivet guns. Definitely not ""Contractor Grade."""
2,Issues with SS rivets,This product is not able to pull a 3/16 Stainless rivet through through a 3/16 hole in stainless tubing. I checked the grip range...Even drilled a 7/32 hole. Broke the handle. Do I not know enough about using a pop rivet gun? Will buy a much larger and heavier duty gun for my application.
5,Good solid product,"This is a well built tool that does just what it is supposed to do. Had one earlier that was defective (it happens) this this one is solid, well built and well thought out. I doubt you'll have trouble with it. I would buy it again without hesitation."
3,"""Contractor"" grade does not mean HEAVY Duty!","I'm sure this is a good unit, but the description of CONTRACTOR grade does not equate to HEAVY duty....cannot rivet 7/32"" or 1/4"" hevay duty size rivets."
1,serious peice of,The one star I am giving it is because it's not a bad color. The one we got just bends the rivet over. Stanley's website is useless on customer support. One reviewer said it was tough enough to use as a hammer. Too bad I already have a hammer.
3,Could be better,"My old Riveter which I've had since about '87 includes a light chain in the handle to hold it closed for storage and a slot in the handle cover for the wrench. The supplied wrench with this tool is smaller and fairly useless than my old one for changing the heads. The wrench is barely larger than the one you get with a mototool.It is solid and does handle stainless steel rivets which my old one did for 24 years.I bought this because it looked better built than my old one, but now after using it I find it less user friendly ergonomically than my old one. There are a number of vendors selling duplicates of my old one and now I wish I had bought oe like it again.My bad."
5,A well built rivet gun,"So far, so good. The gun works great and seems well built. I think there could be some sort of storage for the little wrench that is used to change the nose pieces for different size rivets. I like the feel and heft of this tool and it works!"
1,Jammed on first Rivet. Total garbage,First rivet this thing jammed. The gun will not release the stem of the rivet and it is jammed inside the gun. Nothing I do can dislodge this rivet. This is a piece of trash.
5,Well made Product,"Product is well made and works well. Due to it's construction, it makes putting in Rivets almost effortless. Highly recommend you pony up the extra bucks and get a tool that will be with you a lifetime. Well worth the few extra dollars."
5,rivet gun,Just what I wanted....Very quick delivery time...quality looks excellentOne thing though it should have had some rivets with it I had to go out to buythem seperately...Have not yet been able to get to use it as it is winter in NYS andwith the 2 feet of snow on the ground getting out and puttering is notpossible...but I am looking forward to putting it to good use.
4,"""A Break in the Storm"" by Arnold Simon",This novel holds your attention with its suspenseful plot while simultaneously presenting fascinating historical data. It is a particularly interesting way to learn about this period in history as it approaches the topic of World Wars I & II from a fresh angle that I have never seen represented in any of the myriad other books and films on the subject. It in fact has the makings of an excellent film.
2,Poor man's Boss OC-2,"This is a cheap imitation of the classic Boss OC-2 Octave pedal. It only has one input and one output. It has three pots; the original signal level and two lower octave levels (oct-1 and oct-2). The three can be adjusted to add as much low-end as you (or your amp) can stand. Turning oct-1 up a little, does a fair imitation of a baritone guitar, but if you turn it up beyond halfway it digitally breaks-up, distorts, and becomes randomly inaudable. As musicians say: ""it does not track"". Using oct-2 is so low that it's nearly useless, unless you've plugged your guitar into large a Bass amp. For the price, this little pedal is fun to play with, but I would never really use it for performances."
2,a tool short,"""Includes 1/4"", 3/8"" & 1/2"" ratchets"" Photo shows Two Not Three ratchets! Same for sockets no 1/2"" drive anything in this kit"
3,weeell...,"interesting product. Over half the pieces are 1/4"" drive, yet there is no 1/4"" ratchet or extension, only a 3/8-to-1/4 adapter. The 1/4 driver handle is junk, and has no ratchet fitting. Neither the screwdriver bits nor bit holder are magnetized, so the bits fall right out. And, there is a 1/2"" drive ratchet, that fits the -four- included 1/2"" drive sockets - no extension(s) for these either. Seems like they could/should be made in 3/8. The ratchets are plain, with knurled handles, and seem very sturdy. I wanted a kit that is kind of loaded toward the smaller sizes, and this one satisfies, but some odd design choices. Overall, it's fine, but I am going to end up buying a few extra parts to make it truly handy. It was cheap enough that this doesn't sting."
4,Not bad for a cheapo,"It doesn't come with three ratchets like it states, but it does have the drive piece to enable a different size. The bits are pretty decent, and I have yet to have a problem, but the downsize bit snapped when trying to loosen a bolt. The ratchet holds up well surprisingly. I used it with an extension bar to get an oiled up sparkplug from my truck. Despite a massive amount of tension on my part, the ratchet did not break. This would be a good set to keep in the garage for quick changes on a mower or compressor. I wouldn't recommend it for serious jobs."
4,"Does the job, not an excellent product, but still worth it","I bought this because I only needed a 9/16"" socket, so I didn't want to spend much.My observations:- overall, it's a good set. Everything feels sturdy enough and the set covers a good range of sizes, metric and fractional.- there are 2 wrenches: 1/2 and 3/8- most of the sockets are 1/4- there's an adaptor (3/8 to 1/4), but it would be more useful to have a 1/4 wrench instead of a 1/2.Anyways, for the low price, it is a good set for basic use.If you want to spend a little more, there is a Stanley set that seems to be better."
1,Content Listing Mis-labeled,The musical content listing on this page (as well as on the disc itself) is wrong. It says it has Ivanovici's Waves of the Danube. There is no 'Waves of the Danube.'
3,Don't do a lot of thinking,"This was exactly as advertised. It brought back memories, the feel of the 60's is here. It also reminded me of how easy I was to entertain when I was young.Now however, I understand why it only lasted 2 seasons. All the stories are the same, with different scenery. You'll ask yourself. Is everybody really that dumb? A little thinking would have exposed this invasion.I kept asking myself two questions. 1)How can anyone, now unemployed, afford to do all this investigative traveling? Must be some credit card.2) If It's one shot one kill; and it is, in this show. Why not get a semi automatic gun and an extra clip. Enter an invader location. There always lightly ""manned"", and shoot everyone in sight. Then call in the TV press.Let them get the word out. Crude but effective."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY YO !!! this video is lame,I did not like this video because most girls here are either asian or filipino. Nothing wrong with that I think but they dont get naked or even offer any tease shots for the camera. The video is mostly dedicated to fast cars and well more fast cars. Also did I mention this video is about fast cars ? and it was probably shot by some guy who has a small manhood and thinks big fast cars are more powerful and prettier then girls . Boo stay away from this one
2,Princess Cinderella's Castle Playset,"The pieces were very tiny and the sticker flags kept popping off the plastic. My daughter's favorite part was the pink and white horse with the carriage, which she promptly took over and put with her dollhouse. After asking Santa for a Cinderella Castle she was a bit disappointed. This playset would probably be fine for a child who was just going to set it up and not play with it."
2,"Has what it takes for a fun Castle, but","My girls love the idea of playing with this castle, but they find the figures don't fit any of the furniture pieces and the prince won't stay standing. Mostly, they set up a scene and abandon the playset on the floor after 10 minutes, so the pieces get lost. Or they stick the prince in 'prison' - a tower only accessible by the window, and run over to ask me to fish him out - no easy task!Spend your money on something else. We got more mileage out of the Disney Princess figurine set.Disney Princess Figurine Set"
3,Fine for PC speaker setup - Not for PC Home Theater,"I recently connected my PC to my TV. (They are in 2 different rooms). The video runs via (5m) DVI cable and I was looking for a good way to connect the audio to the receiver-driven home theater 5.1 speakers. Silly me for thinking that a digital coaxial out from this card could simply plug into coax in on receiver and Dolby coding etc. would be recognized. (SEE other review regarding this below). So, after purchasing a 25' coax cable and miniplug connector, I was extremely disappointed NOT to have true 5.1 digital sound from my speakers.Basically, I will have to run a bunch of (looong) analog connecting RCA cables to my receiver, instead of 1 digital coax - what a pain! Not to mention the headphone BS also mentioned.Seems like they overlooked some very basic things with this card and focused on the the processing..."
4,"nice sound, nice price","I got this card a long time ago and could tell a major increase in my audio quality when I had my 5.1 high end speakers plugged in, but ultimitely you need nice speakers to experience the full potential of this card. It has no 5.25 inch bay adaptor like the Platinum does, and although it is old, it is the best for when you have a tight budget."
3,Impressive sounding but buggy,"I purchased this card for the purpose of home recording and gaming, and was immediately blown away by the quality of the sound. However, after only five minutes of using the card, I started having problems with certain applications. Winamp2, for example, would spontaniously become silent while playing files, the music would spontaniously disappear from games (even EAX games) and sometimes creative's music player would malfunction. Tech support didn't have any suggestions, and the support section of Creative's website for this card was almost humorously empty. I am still using Windows 98, so I expect XP users won't have many problems, but even so, I was disappointed by the hassles."
2,NOT FOR HOME THEATRE,"Boy I should have read the reviews before buying this product. Although it says 5.1/6.1, when you use their Digital out to a coaxial input on a receiver, you get 2.1, left and right speakers. Its not true 5.1.Luckily I have got an RA to return this, and my search for a real audio card with optical out continues.I would buy the Sound Blaster ZS Platinum which looks like it has 2 optical outs, but a) it seems like over kill, b) i believe their are products that can achieve what i want for less than $170 and c) I dont think i can trust creative lab anymore."
1,Warning - missing adapter cable inhibits connection to 5.1,"Creative have sold these Audigy 2 kits with digital 5.1 speaker compatibilty plastered all over the package BUT YOU REQUIRE A ""MINIPLUG / DIN (sold seperately)"" ADAPTER CABLE THAT NOBODY HAS ! Including the Amazon and creative online / Telephone shops !!This cable is detailed in the product literature but unavailable at any shop or even at creative shops online or by phone. It should really be included in the package to avoid customer like me ending up frustrated and angry after paying premium money for what looks like a great system but then unable to connect it to a CREATIVE Desktop 5.1 DTT2500 Digital theatre (Cambridge Soundworks).If you check out the internet you will see a HUGE number of forums and bloggs crying over this very issue.I will post a perfomance review when (hopefully) I finally manage to hook up my kit and listen to the sounds.....UNACCEPTABLE from a reputed supplier like Creative."
4,Brilliant,Use it to clean my car in India. It is pretty duststy hence cars need to be cleaned daily. This + the dust ends up eroding the wax surface. I normally dust the car down after I reach home and again early morning after my workout before the staff start cleaning the car. It is less effort for them and actually the car needs less washing especially if you have polished it.
2,Does what it is supposed to,I would not buy this product again. It does what it should but If I had to do it again I would just stick with detaling microfiber towels from Viking/Cobra.
1,Doesn't work as good as it says. Also A lot cheaper at walmart and autozone,This doesn't work as good as it advertises and for $50.00 it should. I was shopping at walmart and they sell it for $11.99 and Autozone sells it for 14.99. Only difference is its not a wooden handle its a hard plastic. Worth getting a plastic handle to save $40.00 in my opinion.
5,Absolutely love it!!!,"I am going to buy more of these for gifts for family and friends. In just a few minutes, it helps my truck to look a million times better. It picks up the dust rather than just spreading it everywhere and it works over and over again. Highly recommended. Definitely a must buy!"
3,"Yes it works, but...","I bought the duster hoping to get rid of the dust easier. Yes it did got rid of the dust, but in the same time, if you have a new car, you will see that it created fine scractches on the surface of the paint. Even though it says it will not scractch you car, but you will see the fine scratches under the sun, it was bad. Word of advice, do not use this on your brand new car, if you baby your car like me. IT WILL create fine scratches!"
5,Great dusting,"Works great ONLY if you have dry dusts. If the dust is wet, or was wet and now dried, it doesn't work. Otherwise, great as a touch up dusting in between washings."
5,A Miracle Cleaner,"I am a car fanatic and have used one of these dusters on my cars for the last decade or more. As long as the surface is dry, it works wonderfully. Once some contaminants start to build on the paint, use the duster, then some Quick Detail with a microfiber cloth to get the paint really clean. My cars always look new with these things. I just traded in my 2004 RX-8 after 2.5 years of using the duster, and it still looked absolutely new. I now use it on my 2006 Lancer Evolution and, again, the car looks brand-new (which it is). I love them."
3,average,"this product does what it is supposed to do, but, I am not real happy with the quality of construction."
2,Doesn't Perform as i Expected.,"I bought the duster for my Corvette, noticed the first few times I used it there were paraffin wax streaks. This is normal until the mop matures or is left out so the paraffin will dry. I have had the duster for almost a year and it still leaves streaks. I have used it on my motorcycle and the paraffin that is left behind is just awful. It might be the color of my car/motorcycle intensifies the streaking effect. I am not at all happy with the results. Yes it does remove dust but leaves residue behind."
1,Scratches....,"Don't use this product. I did purchase one to try out on those ""dusty"" california days here. It takes out all the dust, yes, but leaves very fine scratches on your finish. because of it, I do need to use swirlx and scratchx to remove all the fine scratches it produced. not so good. Seeing that I have a black car, the scratches actually can be seen fairly well. I was extremely disappointed and plan on returning it very soon.I was very VERY skeptical once I saw the giant fibers on this thing. Now theres a reason why detailers don't use normal towels on their cars -- its because of the bigger fibers! They use a special weaved microfiber towel to help detail all their cars. The fibers on the california duster are even BIGGER than normal towels! How can this NOT scratch your finish.I recommend avoiding it if you car about your car. A normal wash, clay, polish and wax will do the job MUCH BETTER than this."
1,WASTE OF JUGGACASH,I WONT BE BUYING ANYMORE ABK STUFFI LIKE HIM ALOT BUT HE HAS LOST A STEPBUT IT SEEMS LIKE ALL HE KNOWS HOW TO SING ABOUT IS SMOKING WEEDHE TALKS ABOUT THE NATIVE SPIRITWELL I HATE TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE BUT YOUR SPIRITUALITY IS FAKECUZ ITS A DRUG INDUCED SPIRITUAL HIGHTRY USING THE POWER OF YOUR MIND AND MEDITATE TO FIND TRUE TUNNELS OF SPIRITUAL GREATNESS
2,A Big Krapfest.,"Sorry, that title is cheesy. I bought this cd thinking that these songs might be alright, but only two of them are decent. And the DVD doesn't seem to be over 80 minutes to me. More like thirty or forty. HUGE letdown to me. And I buy everything Psychopathic. This shouldn't have been released in my opinion."
3,DVD is good. CD is not,"I'm a big fan of ABK, I even have his underground releases... But... I surprisingly did not like this CD. The DVD has some cool footage from The Gathering of the Juggalos though.[...]"
5,Another GREAT movie,"Saw this at a film festival , bought the dvd, watched it and today , after years , watched it again.Simply love it.Another feel good movie that just want you to get all your friends together and have a great time.More important is the fact that you must forgive."
2,Kids book,I wish my husband would have read the previous review before buying this book (at full price)four our 17 year old daughter who is considering a career as an adventure tour guide. This is for a grade school age child and does have some good basic information. Would be good for a career book report for a 3rd or 4th grader.
2,This is not about Tchaikovisky it is about MTT,"I bought this DVD thinking that it would follow the previous DVD where there are information about the author, places where the author were while composing the piece. Ideas that would lead us to a better understanding of what was going on and what MTT thinks about that specific part of the piece.I have only two more MTT DVD (Beethoven and Berlioz) and I'll buy more in the future.But this one is about MTT and the Orchestra. It would be GREAT if only in another DVD or in another situation.In order NOT to dissapoint the fans (I am a fan) very much, there is at the ""extras"" some information about the author and the piece.Now about the piece. Sorry - sorry - sorry to say - if you want Tchaikovsky look for the Blue-Ray of Valery Gergiev (4th, 5th and 6th) - way much better.I like MTT - I really do. But possible he tried to fix something that was not broken - and made an unexpected DVD.Wishing you all the bestMarcelo"
2,Not for narrow feet...,Love the color but very disappointed in the fit. I have heard for so long how comfortable the Acorns are but having narrow feet I just swam in these...way to wide. I couldn't see that these were any better made or felt any more comfortable than a similar pair for sale at Bi Mart for $6.99. As for arch support I found none. Not happy with my purchase at all but tried washing them to see if that would give them a snugger fit (which it didn't)and of course not returnable after that...only good for the yard sale I am sorry to say.
5,"Hard Body Yoga..Great name, great dvd","I love the video. Tari is very passionate about her workout and it shows. I found it hard but not too hard, as there are different levels instructed by other instructors in the background. I hope to be at Tari's level soon. The music is pleasant and not too loud. Everything is explained very well and I will be buying another for my mother, as she would enjoy this DVD. The great thing about the DVD is that you can build with it as it may take you a while to be able to complete it at the expert (Tari) level. I also have signed up for Tari's nutrition class on her site...cant wait."
4,You'll definetly feel your muscles with this one,"I also bought this dvd based on recommendations (especially on Collage.com) this is definetley not a regular yoga workout and no, it's not power yoga either! It's strength training based on basic yoga poses but don't get me wrong, this workout is not basic , it's very challenging , I think all my muscles were sore a day after I did this. The workout consist of segments which starts with sun salutaions and than a few segments of lower body and than upper body for a few times and in the end there's an abs section which to me was more for the legs than the abs, and than final stretch. Every exercise is done 4 times x 3 sets with every 4th time is performed really slow so your muscles will work very hard. It was a very ""sweaty"" workoutand I think it's good when you get bored from your regular yoga workouts or just want a diffeent kind of strength training.66 minutes."
5,Yoga Meets Strength Training,This is a fantastic workout. You need no equipment for this video. I've never done a body-weighted workout this challenging. Each major muscle group will be worked thoroughly.
5,Entertainment Industry Economics,"A very clear explanation of the history, issues, rationale and economic flows of the entertainment industry. The book includes a comprehensive list of sources of information as well as details the sources for every bit of information it provides. This is very useful as it familiarizes the reader with the gathering of information in relation with the industry and the relative authority of the sources."
3,Angels of Death: Inside the Biker Gangs' Crime Empire,"good account of the Hells Angels activity, related in an entertaining manner."
3,Fed Fiction,"In its attempt to portray the Hells Agels MC as a maurauding band of murderers or better yet organized crime headed by the Don of all Dons Sonny Barger, the author contains no consistant time line. Its all over the place and nowhere at the same time! by a Hells Angels Supporter"
3,Get your facts straight,"I find it hard to take these writers seriously. They write that the world's largest and oldest biker rally is held in Sturgis, COLORADO! Nope, it's Sturgis, South Dakota.They also write about a ride from the Phoenix area to Florence, Colorado and describe it as 80 miles. Fact is, it's closer to 800 miles! Makes you wonder how many other mistakes slipped by BOTH of the authors AND proofreaders, as both these facts are pretty easy to confirm."
3,If you like Chris Noth....,"This movie is so cheesy but was so much fun to watch. I am glad I got it and watch it repeatedly. The beginning feels a little like a Law and Order episode and then turns into something like an episode of Serpico, only not taking itself so seriously. Its also good to see Colm Meaney in something NOT playing a slimy bad-guy too. For Chris Noth fans looking for a great work of art from him, you won't find it in this movie, but it makes a nice addition to any collection of ""crime dramedy."""
4,Touching,When I first heard this song I was touched. It related to me so much. I have been threw some things and to here him say those words gave the push to keep going. I have decided to nominate this song for graduation of the Senior class of 2001.... I think that it should really speak highly of my senior class.
2,not fragrant as I expected,"I've read some descriptions for these ice cream baths, some saying they'll be good for 2-3 baths, some saying one ice cream per bath. This being my first of this line, I thought I'd melt half the ball and see how much it affected the bath. With half melted, I thought the bath's smell wasn't that strong and the water didn't look like it had enough oils and color, so I put the rest in. After taking the bath with one whole ice cream, I'm a little disappointed. I love lavender and go to a yearly festival to get my fix. This one didn't have enough of the scent to give me that relaxing feel of lavender. Overall, it had enough oils (over 6 different oils in there) but none of them were lavender....doesn't that seem wrong for a lavender -named and -colored bath product? I won't be buying again and wish I could return the other 2 ones I bought. I'll probably gift them."
2,Not what pictured,"The photo shows a different product than what is delivered to your home. The water blade is all it was advertised to be. The handle however was not as described. The bracket that holds the blade only holds it at one point, not two as shown. The blade still does the job, but when applying pressure it tends to unscrew from the handle."
5,country legends live mini concert Rex Allen,It was great to see this legend of screen and song performing live on stage. I know he has been gone for 10years but it still was good to see him as an older person performing and with Rex Jnr
2,A very dark story,"I got this book because I loved the movie (1989's ""She-Devil,"" staring Roseanne Barr). But the book isn't as good as the movie. I think the character of Ruth is much more cynical and hateful in the book. There isn't a lot of comedy or lightheartedness. Moreover, the book has somewhat of a ""dark"" feel and has some underlying messages in it about revenge. I did not enjoy this book."
4,Devilishly Good Fun,"I had no idea what I was getting into when I purchased this book. Let me just say that I have enjoyed it a lot! It is a clever portrait of a woman exacting revenge on a cheating husband. Her revenge is over-the-top, wide-ranging and creative.This book is a lot of fun - it can be taken lightly and read purely for entertainment, or can be delved into for its deeper meaning and feminist thought."
4,Funny and insightful,"The only problem I have with this book is either that Fay Weldon made a lot of mistakes in the American setting (judge in a wig, the California coast and Park Avenue seemingly within driving distance) or else the book that I have is an Americanized version of the original Brit. novel, and did not have a particularly careful American editor.Fay Weldon deals vey well with modern-day divorce, in which anyone who wants out can leave with few consequences, and never mind the family unit."
3,One of the few. . .,". . .novels where it's a good premise, but I actually liked the movie adaptation better.I can believe that Ruth would indeed turn as dark and cynical and manipulative as she does in the novel.What I have a hard time swallowing is that1) She manages to cast aside enough of her personal inhibitions to use the means that she uses to wreak general havoc--shades of _Naked Came the Stranger_, for those of you who have read that. The movie is superior here not only because one would like to think that revenge on that scale _is_ possible without resorting to those means, but a woman who grew up thinking herself plain and not having had much luck in love is rather unlikely to hit on that as a method in any case.2) That after all Bobbo has done to her, that she'd even _think_ of wanting him back afterward, let alone going through what she does in order to achieve that goal.Sure, read the book, but take it with a grain of salt."
5,roseanne didn't do it justice.,"Stay far far far away from the movie made from this book. It stinks.The book, on the other hand is pure genius. It's a great women's novel. We've all felt what the protagonist feels - but she has the courage to act on it. A delicious feminist story of revenge!"
1,abysmal,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I can't even bother to finish it, as Ruth begins to transform herself for the inevitable, predictable conclusion no doubt to come. Hard to believe I bothered to waste money on this rubbish."
3,Been there before,"I have many CD's of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.Even though I like them all, they don't exactly set me on fire.Let's face it, this choir is certainly one of the best in the world, but each recording is just a little (or maybe a lot) like the last one.The choir, whils't quite lovely, is very predictable.It's all just a little too technically perfect. Even a little boring.Having said that, ""It's Christmas"" is nice and easy listening on Christmas Day with the family gathered around.It's purely background music, it won't glue you to your CD player.Come December 26, it will be filed away until next Christmas Day."
1,Sound mars a great performance,"This is a great performance of Rigoletto, and Paskalis is one of the most underrated baritones of the 20th century, comparable, even if not quite equal to the great Rigolettos Gobbi, Warren or Merrill. The sound is very poor though, and when I say poor I don't mean anything like 'normal' off-the-air lives from the 50s or even the 30s. To give an idea, this sounds like mastered by a monkey on a broken machine."
4,Love these!,These are awesome and the real deal!! I was able to replace two if my vitamins with thus one! Love Opti-Women!!
3,It's ok,"My wife didn't like it as much as previous vitamins. She said the others gave her more of a ""pick-me-up"". I'm guessing this doesn't have caffeen. Still a quality product. I like ON products."
5,The best I have tried so far!!!,"I am a very active person, I exercise every day. But I have to say I feel more enegertic now. That's exactly what I was looking for; this is a great supplement to add to your regimen. I almost finish this bottle and I am ready to order a second one. This is a keeper for me!!!"
5,awesome,Never had a problem taking vitamins when I was younger but after having kids Every vitamin I tried made me sick theseare the only vitamins I take now they make me feel great and no vomiting like the other vitamins.... great product at a great price!
5,Great Multivitamin,The pills themselves are the perfect size and you only need to take 2 once a day with your meal. These multivitamins really help my energy levels!
2,Two Stars,"Im giving this product 2 stars not because its necessarily a bad product,but because I ran it past my Doctor who told me to throw them in the garbage. The list of ingredients is long and includes many herbs that can cause adverse reactions in people if not immediately, through drug interactions or over time. I thought the more ingredients the better, I was wrong. I liked the capsule, and like that it does not upset my stomach, but in the end I had to ask myself if it was worth risks and decided I'd follow my Doctors advice and just go with a basic Centrum Vitamin. So use these at your own risk."
3,Dissappointed,I was dissappointed that these were not in tablet form - they are in the powder inside a capsule. I have never seen a multi-vitamin in this form before.
1,Made me sick,Opti Women vitamins made me terribly sick. I warn other women to ask the company for a sample before you spend all that money. Had to throw mine away.
3,Powerful but Untasty,I got these and did feel healthier - the only thing is that they were kinda big and had an unpleasant aftertaste.
2,powdery bottle,Hi. I just got my Opti-Women I've ordered. When I open de bottle it was awkwardly powdery as if one capsule has poped up inside bottle and spread the powder. I don't know if this normal since this is my first time consuming the product; but if it is its very unpleasant having my finger all powdered everytime I took one capsule out. Thats why am giving it 2 star...
3,"Good deal, but they made me sleepy","I was very excited to try these vitamins because they are so cost efficient for a good quality multivitamin. My boyfriend uses the male version and loves them, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I think I'm allergic to an ingredient in them, because they made me sleepy. Every day around 3pm I could barely keep my eyes open when taking them. When I stopped and went back to my former multivitamin, the tiredness went away."
4,Gmp-certified,"With many vitamin companies, you don't really know what you could be getting; containment(heavy metals, harmful chemicals), low potency. I trust Optimum Nutrition. This was recommended to my by a friend that uses Opti-Men. I'm a little iffy on some of the supplements used in this, like Dong Quai or Chaste berry and others. I hate to think that I'm paying a little extra for herbs that don't have much scientific backing. However, I haven't seen much info on those things being HARMFUL, so I do like that it is at least coming from a trustworthy source. These are easier to take than the gritty outside of most drugstore multivitamins. Its a capsule so it goes down smoother, the smell is also quite tolerable. I can't really feel a difference between taking these. I'd be stuck on these, though, if they had a higher amount of calcium."
5,Great Multivitamin!,"I have taken a multivitamin for many years but I would not have said I felt like they made any real difference. Until I started taking Opti-Women. This is now my vitamin of choice. It has been about a month and I have more energy and more stamina. I work out three times a week and since I have been taking this supplement, my body just feels better. If you are active and need a boost I would highly recommend you try these!"
5,Faithful user for years,I love the ON brand. I have been a faithful user for years. Opti women feels different and the body utilizes it differently and more effectively than other brands. Great formula. Pair with Omega 3's ladies and you will feel wonderful.
5,Great vitamin,I am pleased with this vitamin and have had no side effects from them like I often do with some vitamins. Great value!
3,It's okay,"I expected more but it serves it's purpose I suppose. It doesn't give me the energy boost I thought it would but I have noticed if I don't take them I'm more tired than usual. I must say I wake up at 4:20 am every weekday to go work out then come home take a quick shower run out to drive my son to his bus stop that is about 3 miles away then come back have breakfast finish getting my daughter ready and making her lunch then take her to school and then drive to work. By then it's 8:30 am and I feel like I've had a full days work already. I get out by 5:30pm and end up getting home by 6-6:30pm to rush and feed the kids, check homework, do dishes, clean up, do showers and so on. And I'm a single mom. So I guess it's normal to feel tired all the time."
3,Not quite my taste,I found to get nauseous when i didn't take it with food. My personal trainer recommended it but i was not satisfied. Otherwise its an average vitamin.I probably wont buy it again.
2,Smells fishy and caps are powdery...,I got these because I love MOSTLY every ON product. When I recieved them and opened the jar and they were kind of dusty and powdery like one had opened up inside. The smell is fishy so everytime I take them I have to wipe the residue thats left on the capsules. I thought they were the hard plastic pills not the see through old school ones.
5,Pinky,"loved this movie. It put me in mind of Imitation of Life which I also love. I found my daughter,who does not like these kind of movies, has put it on her best movie list and a must see for her female children.. It really changed the relationship between she and I"
3,daring for its time,"Interesting how this movie speaks of race and racism while at the same time promoting stereotypes. Worth watching, especially if have an interest in communications, media, or black studies."
3,Interesting,"I saw this one years ago on VHS and was glad to be able to add it my collection on DVD. Considering the time that this film was made, I think it is a good one."
4,Color Line,"This was a very dramatic film. Great acting. It wasn't as touching as Imitation of Life, but just as dramatic.This film tells us to be true to yourself. We can't help who we are or who our family members are.Take a stand, make a choice and believe in it. Good will come out of it."
4,"Dated Film, but Still Potent and Powerful","Although certain aspects of ""Pinky"" are very dated, I still thought it presented a powerful message of prejudice which, sadly, is still present in our society. While Jeanne Crain didn't look the role of a half-black woman, she still gave one of her very best performances and deservedly received an Oscar nomination for it. The supporting cast was also great, especially the always wonderful Ethel Waters. Elia Kazan is one of the greatest directors of all time, and I commend him for attacking a potentially dangerous subject like race in a time when it was taboo."
3,"Good ideas, bad form","Pinky shows the conflicted views of a black woman passing as white. We see her search for some identity while she is torn between the world of blacks and her heritage and the world of whites, those who persecute her ancestors.However; the film was a bit dull. There was an overall lack of action, and the ending was abrupt and poorly constructed. The ideas behind the movie were good, but the plot was almost too simple, and her internal conflict was resolved too quickly. They also neglected to show her lasting emotions for Tom, and it is unrealistic to think that she could drop contact with Tom so quickly and recover so well."
3,"Leftovers from ""Imitation of Life""","The movie was a ""weak"" attempt at recreating the classic ""The Imitation of Life"". What this movie did accomplish was to show how racist the movie industry was during that time, to cast a white female in the role of a mixed woman. During that era I guess it is understandable why Black people were trying to pass. It is sad how a people could deny the beautiful hertiage of their African ancestors. The performance of Ethel Waters was enjoyable I'm glad that at least a Black woman was cast for her role. I do enjoy the Black and White films for their artistic value. It is a must see picture for the present and future generations that may try to ""pass"" for something they can never become."
2,phony liberal guilt at its most obnoxious,"elia kazan directed this liberal race fantasy which today reeks of the type of phoniness that kazan mocked when it came to jews in ""gentlemans agreement"". jeanne crain is ridiculous as the black girl who has been passing for white up north, but whose horrible secret comes to the surface when she goes home on a visit to grandma. turgid direction and a stupid script, occasionally saved by the sterling supporting performances of ethel barrymore (as a dying southern grande dame who takes an interest in pinkys future), and ethel waters as pinkys grandmother (and speaking of miss waters, when oh when will we be able to see her stunning performance in ""member of the wedding"" on dvd?). ""pinky"" is patronizing in a defining use of the word."
2,Bad quality,These is a bad quality product. From day one the valve broke and the mattress would not keep the air inside. Very disapointed
5,GREAT PURCHASE,"While on vacation at a friends house. Our 2 1/2 yr old daughter used this bed to sleep. The setup of the bed took only minutes and was very easy. My daughter did not experience one night of restless sleep, she slept very comfortably and never rolled out of the bed once. She even had room for her favorite stuffed animals on the bed. We have been very happy with the whole package (storage bag and bed). We highly recommend this bed."
2,"Poorly made, even worse customer service","We have owned this bed for a little over a year. Probably have used it a dozen times for my 3 year old son. It's super easy to set up, and did stay inflated fine. The problem we have now is that there's a small flap inside to keep the air in. When I deflated the bed the flap snapped off and inside of the bed. I contacted customer service and was told that it has a one year warranty and that it probably works fine without it. It didn't. So beware, it will snap off because of the way it's made, and you will just be out of a travel bed and money if it's been more than a year!"
1,Don't buy this,I bought this to take to the beach for my grandson. When we inflated the bed there was a defective seam so that the bed was lopsided. I would never buy from this company again.
3,Great idea bad product,I bought this for my 2 year old son for over nights at gradma. No matter what I tried I could nt get it to stay inflated. My son was sleeping on the ground and because the sides did not have enough air he keep rolling out. After two hours we just put some blankes on the floor.
3,portable bed,"I like how easy it is to store, but It is hard to close it properly without the air escaping."
1,flimsy construction,Maybe I just got a lemon but everything went wrong with this. The airpump fell apart the minute I turned it on(I had to find another) and the mattress couldn't hold air through the first night. (And YES I know how to operate and close an air mattress valve correctly). I returned it and Amazon was great about a full refund.
5,Kids love it!,Well needless to say I have kids who have used this product-have 2 of the Gentleair kids beds and have a hard time keeping the kids off of it.They love taking it to friends houses or to grandmas for sleep overs. They are 5-7 and can pack the bed in its own backpack that comes with each bed-they can attach the pump themselves and blow it up--have not had any leaks(4 months of hard use) and would highly recommend it to anyone who has kids that love to have sleep overs.
1,Won't stay inflated,"After my first bed failed, and after some back and forth with the manufacturer, I received a second bed. I'm sad to say that I've had the exact same problem with the replacement which is that it will not stay inflated overnight if a child is sleeping in the bed. In both of the beds we've had, air seeps out of the area near the inflation point which indicates a design or manufacturing flaw.I really wish this bed worked, and maybe they just have a bad batch at the moment, but I must advise against buying it."
2,Did not work out,"this is a great concept however, ours would not hold air. after the first night i folded a comforter and placed it on the floor. our 2 1/2 year old loved it and with a blanket and protective pad folded we had no trouble with it staying in place. doubt a sheet would work as the sides are still slippery. love the ""lip"" as it helped to hold all his animals and pillow in. have not contacted manf. to see if can exchange for one that holds air. oh and the zipper for the storage bag is cheep and came apart first try."
1,UPSET,this product looks horrible. i asked before hand from the seller and they said the measurements were in feet. this was a lie. it is in centimeters.SMALL. and on bad quality canvas. the paint does not look like the picture. the picture is so nice and this product looks nothing like it.
4,"Great Value, But.........","This item originally arrived badly damaged - no protective packing material in the carton at all, so I initiated a return.The same day I spotted the same machine at Costco with a Honda engine, which I prefer. I bought it, and even though the Honda is 5hp, it has a slightly higher psi rating.Amazon was quick to answer my email, and even called immediatly, but it took over a month to credit my debit card!ANYWAY, the washer works great, the nozzle quick connects are a nice feature, and it has enough power for anything I've tried around the house so far."
5,Great Gringos in Paradise,Skip & Chippers verdant description of Costa Rica leaves one yearning for more. As a former resident I can attest that their personal observations are accurate and correct. It's a great book!
5,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!!!","I had been looking for ""Footnotes"" for a long time as I sang the song ""I can't get near you"" for my collect recital and this is the only albumn that has it.What a JOY to find this albumn again (in CD format, no less), joined with ""In the Volume of the Book"".It reminds me of back in the 70's when I saw a huge concert with 2nd Chapter of Acts, Keith Green, all those Jesus-lovin' people in one big ""Marathana"" concert in Sacramento.This is my favorite 2nd Chapter of Acts Albumn (I have all the rest). hee!"
4,Awesome,"This play was absolutely awesome. It is very humurous and is definately a page turner. I have also seen it performed, and it's even funnier on stage. A must read, and a must see!"
2,Good concept Poor Product,"I bought this for my husband who is only about 170lb 6ft average size guy. When he layed on it, I can see the creeper slowly sagging in the middle, and my husband could not roll on it. Its lightweight (which is what we thought we wanted) however, this is a flimsy product. Not worth the money, We will be returning the item, and going to walmart to purchase their creeper which has padding and about $10 less. Look elsewhere. I don't recommend this product unless you are a very dainty person and weigh less than 100lbs maybe it'll do the trick for you, but if you are of average size and build, find a different creeper."
2,A Big Disappointment,"While it's true that this book covers quite a bit of material, has nice pictures and is reasonably well organized, the publishers should immediately fire whoever it was that claims to have proofread this mess! And this textbook is indeed a mess.Just for starters - the math portions of the book are laughably wrong (e.g., ""500/200 = 2""), the answers at the back don't address all the questions they are supposed to, some of the answers make no sense, and the misspelling of the drugs (for instance, ""Demero"" for ""Demerol"")is just plain irresponsible. Just as a previous reviewer said, it doesn't take much to lose complete confidence in both the text and the problem sets, so you can't use it reliably either in a classroom or as a self-study guide.Because of this, there is no good reason to spend money on this particular book. Ship it back to the publisher and author, and tell them to get their respective acts together!"
2,LOTS OF MISTAKES IN THIS BOOK,How many mls in a teaspoon? 4mls if you ask Jahangir Moini. I also suppose the female and male signs got switched when we wern't looking. Oh let me count the mistakes. I guess the proofreaders were on vacation that day. Don't use this book. Get the APhA Basic Pharmacy & Pharmacology Series instead. ISBN 0-89582-736-0 by morton publishing.
4,my opinion,I thought this book is very good with details and thoroughly written. It has everything you need to know for pharmacy work. I enjoyed it very much. It is especially interesting with its color and photos.
5,Excellent Choice,I have purchased a few books for pharmacy tech and find this to be the most successful. The author states facts clearly. It is easy to understand and is full of useful information. I strongly recommend it to all in the pharmacy field. It helped me understand it all and the tests were a great review. It is definetly worth your time and money. It really is an excellent choice! Thanks to the author.
5,Very helpful!,This was an extremely helpful text. It provided insight into all aspects of pharmacy. I found this book to be a great comprehensive approach to the world of pharmacy. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in this career path.
3,Too much error,"The book is nice for the price. I have read most of the content, and i found the book has numerous unpleasant mistake. P219 Example question, ""drop factor of 20gtt/min"", which left me a confusion, because drop factor should be in gtt/ml."
3,Nice short book,This book was nice. I was forced to read this book because we needed a historical novel. This book is about a girl and her brother who lost their family in a fire. The tinderbox is the only thing that she had to remember them. They lived with their neighbors and learned to love them. The conflict which was about their aunt coming to claim them and about the marriage offer Isaac made her. It was an easy to understand novel especially for teens. The ending seems to be lacking though but the characters were pretty good.
3,"Mediocrity, thy name is ""Live in Brooklyn""","Thought about going for 1 star to counteract all the mindless 5-star [cough] reviews [cough] on this page.Here's the rundown. Fanboys and girls will eat it up. 5starz, ez! Jaded heads will talk about how phish peaked, and it's been all downhill ever since 90/93/95/97/Big Cypress. Whatever.Truth, as always, is in the middle. This isn't a bad show. But it isn't a particularly good one, either. The first set is hit or miss. Aside from ""Dinner,"" the first 45 minutes are mostly forgettable. Moma>Free is a genuine highlight. Maze, Fankenstein are hollow shells of their former selves. 2nd set starts well. 46 Days > Possum, Oh Kee Pah > Suzy are all strong, without too many strey notes. From that point on, though, it's fairly disappointing as several would-be climaxes fizzle, failing to live up to potential. The encore is brutal.Recommendation:Ignore the hype; this is not ""the one."" Buy it for Moma and the first 45 minutes of set II."
2,Disappointed,"i'm a little jaded, so i might be bias, but wow, whyd they choose to release this show? tons of mistakes, not just by trey but by fishman as well, the band just doesnt seem in synch for a lot of this show. its always great to see shows dvds, but if this is the impression that younger phish fans will have....yuck! jams dont really go anywhere and composed sections of most songs are bad. second section of divided sky made me especially sick. the dvd extras of trey singing anything but me and the connection sends the message clear to fans what market they're going for..."
5,Order from Dry Goods,Order from Dry Goods and you get a bonus CD with the following tracks:Exclusive Bonus Disc:Camel Walk (6/18/04)Stash (6/18/04)Cars Trucks Buses (6/18/04)Tweezer (6/18/04)Chalk Dust Torture (6/18/04)A Song I Heard The Ocean Sing (6/17/04 Soundcheck)Undermind (6/17/04 Soundcheck)Crowd Control (6/17/04 Soundcheck)
2,if you !LOVE! phish it might be worth it for the moma/free,i get sad when i hear some of the songs on this. its historic for showing the fans that trey(he is getting older and the dexterity is bound to suffer some) seems to have stopped caring about fulfilling his pivotal/crucial role in the evolving sound ball that is phish. the dismal maze and divided sky have literally brought a tear to my eye but so has the ecstatic moma dance for completely different reasons. its a roller coaster ride as far as the execution of the songs go but if you're tripping on acid you probably wont care. it was the first of their concerts i ever saw and i enjoyed it then but time hasnt been so kind to this show. newcomers should look to the mid nineties for a taste of what phish could do when they were on fire.
1,buyer beware,"I ordered this and received the CD , not the DVD . Now I know why it's only $9.99. Will think twice before ordering from amazon again ."
4,Phish is about fun.,"If you miss Phish, and would like to spend some more time with the band, this is a nice way to do it. All bands change with time, so some reviewers will note that the Mike's Song ect.. is not played with the same spirt that it was once was played with, but that's OK (they only played it 100,000x). It's still fun! I would like to see an older show released, hell I like to see a ton of shows released! This is still the best DVD release the band has put out. If you're a Phish fan and have a twenty to spend on a DVD pick this up."
5,Good Duster For The House,"I use this duster in the house on my furniture, TVs, whatever needs dusting. It works as well as the Swiffer dusters but you don't have to keep buying replacements, which is better for both the environment and the wallet. It's size is probably comparable to a Swiffer duster, and it comes with a storage bag to help keep it clean."
2,Disappointed,"I bought my first mini duster about three years ago at a Smart & Final. It was absolutely WONDERFUL! I returned recently to buy more--one for myself and several more to use as gifts for family and friends. I was told that they no longer carry them and that I should try an auto supply shop. I found the ""mini car duster"" at Checker Auto and although it is smaller than the one that I originally purchased, which was labeled just ""mini duster,"" I figured that it was smaller since it was for the interior of a car, but should otherwise be the same. I bought it anyway since I had not been able to find the ""mini duster."" I was very disappointed that it is not as good as the first one that I had bought. The strands are thinner and there are fewer of them. The dusting results are significantly inferior to the results that I got with the first one--it just moves the dust around; it doesn't pick it up like a ""magnet."" I really loved this thing and am bummed that it just isn't very good."
5,The Original California Mini Duster,I have a mini duster that is five or six years old and it appears to be much heavier and thicker than the new one. Guess what? It is because it is full of dust. This new duster works just fine.
4,A fantastic reference,"I've owned this book for years, to the point where I really have to consider buying a new copy, my old one is so worn. It is an excellent resource for anyone beginning a study of heraldry, containing a good overview of the history of the subject, and how the practice of heraldry developed over the centuries. The artwork included ranges from very simple early pieces to some fantastically baroque examples, and gives a nice sence of the progression of heraldic art. It's not a deep and in depth book, but it's really one of the best quick reference/beginning student books on the subject available."
4,One of the Better Police Training Videos I've Seen,"A very good over-all physical techniques video. You can tell the instructor, C.J. Caracci, has an ego the size of football field...but he knows his material. The poor S.O.B. Caracci demonstrates on sure takes a beating in the video (can you say wrist pain?). Caracci is realistic in his approach and shows counters to the techniques he teaches, which in my opinion, makes him more credible. I recommend this video for anyone who has to restrain/control individuals as part of their job description."
3,"Great Record, but 3 stars for this reissue","Don't get me wrong, it sounds great and the bonus tracks are excellent, but the fade-out drum solo on the first song, Chasing Shadows, is no longer a fade out on this reissue, it simply cuts off. I compared to the vinyl to be sure, as I thought something sounded off, and yup, it cuts off short. Still, if you can get past one unnatural sounding break on the album, this reissue is worth it. Hold on to your record if you still have it though."
4,Really helps the back.,My wife has been on strict bed rest for a month and we bought this about one week into it. She has benefited from using this roll pillow since she got it. She uses it under her knees will lying on her back and between her knees when laying on her side.We recommend this pillow highly.
3,Not even close!,This is the prime example of hollywood intention to destroy a great piece of art and show us exactly what they wanted us to see..The original film iwas and still is a big success in Europe and Latin America and this film is not even close to original in any aspect!... The only good thing about it is the cinematography and Al Pacino.....nothing else is even close or near to the original film!...get that instead...you wont be dissapointed!
2,Not good.,"Just the fact that Al Pacino's insomniac character is named ""Will Dormer"" is enough to relegate this movie to the trash heap. ""Dormer"" meaning ""to sleep"" in French, so, ""a will to sleep"". Gah!Without commenting on the story itself, which is bound to appeal to some people and not others, I just want to say that all three principals in this mess overacted within inches of their lives."
2,Formula Boredom at It's Best,"After reading a rave review in the main Richmond, VA newspaper, I set out to see this movie, expecting something engaging and thrilling. Instead, I left feeling disgusted and cheated even at matinee prices.Al Pacino is a fine actor; however, this movie did little to bring out the vitality he's shown in so many other movies. Instead, the viewer is treated to dialogue so wooden, you want to light a fire under it and run screaming from the theatre. Expect dialogue such as the following: ""The jury hasn't ever seen a child killer, PAUSE.... but I have. BIG PAUSE....""Robin Williams presents some fine moments, but they aren't able to rescue the movie from itself. I knew it would be difficult for Christopher Nolan to repeat the magic that ""Momento"" brought to viewers. However, I wasn't expecting this to be so formulaic and frustratingly unoriginal.If you want snappy dialogue and interesting characters, do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,Insomnia could put you to sleep,"This is one of the biggest wastes of a slew of good actors I've ever seen. Hilary Swank: wasted; Christopher Nolan: wasted; the gifted Maura Tierney: about four lines altogether; Robin Williams: horribly miscast. He's about as scary as a kid in a halloween costume and looks b-a-d. There are so many holes in this plot you could drive tractor trailers through them. And there's an ongoing bit of nonsense about Pacino being unable to cut off the perpetual daylight leaking in around the edges of the flimsy window shade. As if a place like Alaska wouldn't have decent shades on the windows! Give this one a miss. It's incredibly dreary. Pacino has insomnia but I could barely stay awake, waiting for something to happen. It's all sizzle and no steak."
5,Reference quality DVD transfer,"The DVD format has been out for several years now, and it seems studios are finally paying attention to the transfer to DVD. I believe this is because of the growing number of people who are buying HDTVs and expecting their source material to approach the quality of the HDTV signal. Unfortunately, this is not really possible, but the Insomnia DVD does approach this nirvana. There are very few MPEG decoding artifacts, and edge enhancement is almost nonexistent. The cinematography captures the beauty of our nation's largest state, Alaska, and will make you want to visit. Definite reference-quality material.The cast performs well, and tension between the psychopathic killer (played by Robin Williams) and the cop with a dubious past (Al Pacino) mounts to an incredible climax. You will need to watch this movie more than once in order to get the subtleties of the story. Highly recommended!"
3,A sure cure for insomnia,"While it has a decent plot and the excellent talents of Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank, this movie goes a little too dark. This is another one I'll probably give away. This movie's sluggish take on what was probably a great plot ruins it's appeal to thriller lovers. It dragged on so slowly that when it was over I was actually relieved While the main characters put in excellent jobs of acting, this movie moves along so slowly that it's almost painful. The beautiful Alaskan scenes are marred by the movie itself. Again, boring, boring, boring."
4,Road to Perdition,"I didn't think I'd like this movie as much as I actually did. It surprised me, I thought it was sad, but the story was very good, and so was the acting. I highly reccomend this movie."
2,A Real Sleeper,"Honestly I tried watching this move THREE different times and I fell asleep during it which I find quite ironic given the title of the movie. Then again, I enjoy irony... however, I did not enjoy this sleeper of a film."
1,Disappointing,"I found 'Insomnia' highly disappointing. After I saw 'Memento' I was absolutely astounded with how brilliant and gut-wrenching it was. I went into 'Insomnia' expecting it to be brillant- and it was a normal, boring avergae Hollywood film. I was so upset becuase Christopher Nolan seemed to have so much talent with 'Memento'- but after he got recognized by Hollywood and got the famous actors and the big money the talent seemed to disappear.I wouldn't say 'Insomnia' is a bad film, but defintely not a good film, or at least nothing special. I wouldn't recommend it, but I would defnitely recommend other films from Christopher Nolan- hopefully his next will be better."
2,Waste of Time,"I had the opportunity to see a sneak preview of Chrisopher Nolan's Insomnia. Here are my thoughts:Poor Camera Angles: The camera switched angles so constantly that the person sitting next to me turned and said ""what is this?"" I almost got a headache. It got a little better as the movie progressed though.Ridiculous Plot Holes: Because this is a remake of a foreign film (which is considered superior to this version), there are several ridiculous plot-holes that make the movie rooted in nonsense almost. A few people left the movie early.Original?: Unlike Memento, Insomnia is extremely by-the-book. There is very little in terms of surprises, it's such standard fare - what's the point? If you've seen the trailer, you've seen most of the movie.Acting: But the actors do a good job with the material... What a waste of talent."
1,Boring.,"Insomnia starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams is pretty boring for a Christopher Nolan film, this is the second film after the brilliant psychological thriller Memento. Insomnia just drags and drags with every minute that passes, even with two famous actors you can't take this film seriously. Hilary Swank is pretty much under-used here, I hated everything about this film. Don't watch this train wreck!"
1,REVISITED.........,"Sorry, I still can't understand the fuss about this REMAKE, or is it a re-imagining? Slightly like ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" isn't it? Yes, apart from the great Alaskan scenery. it remains somewhat bland. Very obviously a star vehicle - perhaps shades of King Lear or something earlier thrown in - let's face it - the final act is positively Grecian in concept!AND that pounding soundtrack - that enough kept Pacino awake!ANOTHER ODD NOTE - the camera angles - 'set-ups' etc. are so similar to the original version. Where's the originality of this version?AND, yes, yes, yes, Hilary Swank is excellent as Ellie Burr, but that's about it!Now, let's get on with our lives in Tinseltown - and stop with the ""remakes' or 'artistic re-imaginings' - OK?"
1,The star is for Robin Williams,"This movie was almost as big a waste of good film as ""Ihstar"" was. I expected the combined talents of Robin Williams and Al Pachino to be a master peice, but what a let down. Well at least now Warren Beaty and Duston Hoffman have someone they can snicker at to."
4,Pacino and Williams SOAR,"Easily one of the most suspenseful films of 2002, ""Insomnia"" is a showcase for Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank - threee Oscar winners who prove their mettle in this fast-paced thriller that's perfect for the long cold winter we're experiencing this year. Williams is a maniacal presence, proving again that the actor can play against type and control his acting chops without going off on tangents. Swank, in a thankless role as a rookie local cop, makes the best of the character's essence as she lovingly learns from Pacino's character. And Al Pacino hasn't been this good in years - his ""HOO-HAW"" inflections from ""Scent of a Woman"" have faded, and he's all character here. See it for these three performances and for a taut script that has twists at every turn."
4,Al Pacino & Robin Williams in the same film,"This is a rare Robin Williams film that he doesn't make an appearance in the movie until very late. And is not a comedy. This I would say as a drama. If you are a fan of Robin Williams in a comedy movies (you may be disappointed to see that he is co-starring in a drama movie). Robin Williams plays an author. And Al Painco plays a cop that is handling a case of a 17 years old girl that was one of Walter Finch's (Robin Williams) fans. As the movie opens, Will Dormer (Al Pacino) arrives in Nightmute Alaska to cover a case of a murdered teenager (Crystal Lowe) and the local police has no idea who murdered the teeanger. But at a cabin in the fog, Will shoots and kills his partner ( Martin Donovan). And only one person knows who really killed Will's partner and that is Walter."
4,A worthy remake,"Disoriented by sleeplessness and troubled by an Internal Affairs investigation that may destroy him, LA detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) becomes involved with a murder investigation in a small Alaskan town and the machinations of a killer (Robin Williams). Directed by Christopher Nolan, who also made the excellent ""Memento"", this remake of a Norwegian thriller is much more than a pale rehash of a superior film, like most Hollywood remakes of foreign movies. Instead, it is a worthy reexamination of the source material. Many of the changes are typically American--the ambiguities in character motivation are removed and the ending is far more moralistic--yet I found it to be the equal of the original. Nolan preserves the sense of disorientation from the first film, and the interaction between cop and killer is intensified and deepened. Recommended."
3,Exciting most of the way through,"Pacino is a lot better than he has been in his last three or four (or five or six) films. Robin Williams is not bad as a killer, but frankly any number of actors could have played the part. Kevin Spacey comes to mind. The movie really centers around Pacino and his slow disintegration as a corrupt cop who is staring wide-eyed at the end of his particular road. The ending is silly and predictable and reminds us we are watching a movie. But it is pretty good fun up until then. Not in the same league with the director's previous effort, INSOMNIA, but more digestible for a mass audience."
1,Boring,"Long drawn out, the pace is that comparable to a turtle. I imagine it could have been good if they would have picked it up a bit. However Robin Williams needs to stick to comedy. He is not the killer type at all, thus his role is fairly unconvincing!Al Pachino as always mastered the part, to the best of his ability. Hillary Swank was very good, for the first time that I've seen.All and all though it's not a movie to run out and pay a lot for, wait until the rental price drops or it's on cable!"
3,A WEIRD MOVIE,I did not feel much exitement or thrill throughout the whole flick.This version was good but still I think the original Norwegian one was better.
1,Insomnia--- A Real Snoozer,Perhaps the most boring movie I've seen this year. The sleepier Al Pachino got the sleepier I got. My wife fell asleep half way through the movie. If she only knew how lucky she was.
3,Not as deep as you think................,"Nolan has in fact proven himself as a wonderful director and story teller, but I would never use this film to showcase his talents. Insomnia does have strong points, from its beautiful cinimatography to its incredible acting from such veterans as Pacino and Williams and even newbie Swank. The film has a promising premise, a killer on the lam and a detective who is slowly fading into oblivion due to sleepless nights. The setting is perfect for such a mystery, a film noir in the forever seeming daylight, but the plots strengths end there. What seems to be a very deep murder mystery eventually floats to the shallow end of the lake as the film drags on to its un satisfying end. I wanted to love this film, but got bored instead......."
3,A Well Made ...,"In 1997 a Swedish filmmaker named Erik Skjoldbjaerg released a film he titled ""Insomnia"". It was about a detective from Sweden who was sent to solve a brutal murder in northern Norway, where the sun shines 24 hours a day... does this sound familiar? I gave this movie three stars simply because of the incredible lack of originality. It is obviously a complete ... of Skjoldbjaerg's film. If you have seen the Swedish film you would agree with me that this movie is far below the standards as a film than the original. Please, if you have already seen this movie, don't buy it. Take the time to purchase Skjoldbjaerg's Insomnia, it is a much better film (if you can live with subtitles)."
3,Good Film,"The DVD features great video quality but the sound was a tad too muffled at times. Moving on, the film reminds me of Se7en in a few ways with lesser chilling scenes. Because of my diehard love for Hilary Swank, I wish she had more of a role or had been completely left out. Robin Williams is good at times but I really don't think he's the ideal person for the villain slot. The hero of the film is Al Pacino who acted pretty good. The 24hour day theme in the film was very good and the locations were good too. I liked how the film played around with guilt and duty.Overall a good film but I've seen better.Some others films you will want to watch if you like this film are ""One Hour Photo"" , ""Heat"" , ""Seven"" and ""Along Came The Spider"""
2,OUCH!,"OK.Someone needs to tell Robin Williams that just because he's brilliant as a comedian, doesn't mean he should try everything else, too ... ?If you're in mood to watch a movie of this style (serial killer, good cop, bad cop), please watch Summer of Sam! That was much more entertaining."
3,"Entertaining, but not everyone's kinda film.","I can't say this is the type of movie I'd usually go to see in the theater, but .. it DOES have Robin Williams in it, so I decided to give it a go. Ironically enough, his role is one totally different from any other roles that he has played. I enjoyed seeing him do something different, but in the long run it wasn't enough for this movie to leave a major impact on me.This is one of those thrillers that is more of an acquired taste. Mind you, I enjoyed the film, but for me, it's more of a movie I'd wait to rent. The cast was enjoyable, and the plot kept you on the edge of your seat, but only if you really dig this kind of movie. I was entertained but somehow expected more. I've never seen the original, so I can't make any comparison. Nonetheless, the friend I brought along with me was incredibly bored. Pity though; I ended up paying for her movie ticket. :-\"
2,Very hit and miss.,"I saw this in theaters, and most of the audience was cracking up at what were intended to be dramatic moments. Robin Williams did a great job, but otherwise I didn't find it impressive."
2,Insomnia,"Other than this movie having a great cast, it was incredibaly boring. My husband and I could barely keep from yawning throughout the whole thing. Some other people I know said the same thing, it moved very slow, and seemed to go nowhere. I would not reccomend it."
2,Dissapointing for a Christopher Nolan film,"For a blatent copy of a excellent Norwegien film, Nolan manages to pull this one out. With a few subtle changes to the original; and then the Nolan touches; ie. cinimatogrphy is nice. In summation, afer two steller films: The Following, and Momento, Insomnia is pretty lack luster and ultimatly a dissapointment to me."
4,"An Intruiging Plot, With A good Message","Insomnia is quite simply about a web of lies, and the consequnces they can produce. It is very well acted on both Pacino's and Williams part, and Swank was brilliant as well. Besides all that good stuff, I am also a fan of the director, ""ever since I saw Batman Begins"" and find his artistic vision to be incredible.The only problem I had with this movie was the ending. Sure, it showed how lying could defeat a person, but I thought a little redemption would have been nice.However, if you have a strong stomach, or a good editing company, I suggest you see this."
5,The best suspense/thriller I've ever seen!,"I absolutely loved ""Insomnia."" The casting was perfect (Al Pacino, Robin Williams). I was on the edge of my seat mostly the whole time! This beautifully made film ranks #1 on my list of best summer movies. I highly recommend ""Insomnia."""
4,Midnight sun isn't so bad!,"I've lived in Alaska for 34 years. ""Insomnia"" is the tip of the iceberg on the scenic beauty of the Great Land. The midnight sun (20-22 hours of daylight) we enjoy during summer months has a more positive effect than portrayed in the film, but I understood the message. I am a HUGE Al Pacino fan and see everything he does so I loved ""Insomnia"" just for that reason. Al doesn't do a bad movie, in my opinion. Other actors were very good and it was an interesting twist with Robin Williams as the ""bad guy"". I highly recommend this film for the acting, scenery, and plot."
4,Film Noir in Living Colour,"The star of this movie is the beautiful background Alaskan scenery. Al Pacino and his partner are banished LAPD detectives, being themselves investigated back home for possible corruption. Partner is shot whilst chasing a runaway bad guy in an Alaskan fog in this atmospheric adventure. Robin Williams is a Bad Guy. Hillary Swank is an actress playing a female this time. ER Nurse Abby is a Lodge conceirge, run away from a past in the lower 48. Stylistically, this is almost film noir (only in living colour) kind of like ""The Big Sleep"" only with no sleep. Reviewed by TundraVision"
2,"More than enough to put me to sleep...,","Nolan's movies divide this reviewer! On the one hand there's thebrilliance of 'Memento,' the magnificence of 'Inception' and on the other the super-silliness of 'The Prestige.' He treads the fine line between rubbish and greatness.This inferior re-working of a 'foreign' film (too hard for us poor english speaking countries to watch with subtitles I guess)falls into the category of the former.Williams over plays as if his life depends on his next pay cheque.I'm only pleased none of my pay went to purchasing the dvd.Boring and predictable."
1,"Insomnia, Yep slept through that one.","I was trilled when this movie came out to rent because I had wanted to see it. I mean, it had Al Pacino and Robin Williams in it, so it had to be great, right? Well, after watching it I was wrong. This movie was totally predictable from the start, and had the same basic plot that I have seen in 40 other movies. I guess that my one star rating might be extreme, but the plot did [was bad]! I guess it might be worth watching just to see Robin Williams in a role that is non-comedic, but as to buying this movie?? I suggest going and renting it for $$$ and buying something else."
1,overacting 101,"Clostrophobic non thriller with Pacino overacting all the way through it. Weak premise, weak plot only watch it if YOU are an insomniac and you've gone through your entire DVD stash!"
1,A Good Time to Get Some Sleep,Th worst Robin Williams i've watched! It is a drab slow moving stupid film not worthy of being on a DVDRated R For-Stupidity
2,Insomnia,"This movie stunk......It could of been done without the superstar talent and it probably would have been more enjoyable. These actors did anything but the memorable job that garnished all of their individual accolades in the past. I do not blame the actors themselves, they were restrained by the bad plot, and average direction by a great talent. Nothing about this movie stood out except for the bland taste left in your mouth when the movie ends. I have not been this disappointed since I lost 2 hours of my life viewing ""The Pledge""."
5,reveals disturbing themes,"This movie takes all my assumptions about writers and police work and puts these themes together in a manner that coincides with disturbing psychological disorientation. Once the writer starts sucking up as much danger as he can make contact with, the plot is twisted enough to make all the confusion expected instead of surprising, but if you pay attention, you can twist in the wind right along with it."
3,Opposite of Insomnia,"Although this movie was mildly entertaining with a neat cast, I found it long and drug out. I almost fell asleep during this movie. Basically it's an Alaskan murder case and two L.A. detectives are hired to assist. During an exploration of evidence one of the L.A. detectives get's shot. The supspected murdurer literally knows who did it. And this whole woven story comes into effect."
4,"Not really a twist plot; more like crime, guilt, and lies","Some people complaint that the plot is straightforward and not enough twists. However, I believe this movie is meant to be straightforward in order to show how people lose themselves under guilt and transgression. Then, they start to lie and do more crimes due to self preservation. Don't watch this movie if you have this kind of guilt; otherwise, you will know what I am talking about. Compared to Nolan's other movies, this one is probably closer to Dark Knight rather than Memento in terms of the spirit."
2,Great Sleep Aid,"This movie was very slow moving, the plot was okay if you could stay awake. However this proved to be too much for me. I managed to fall asleep two times while trying to watch it on two different occasions. The third time was the charm, I did manage to stay awake. For me it wasn't worth it, love Robin Williams and Al Pacino but even that didn't really save the movie in my eyes. All that being said it did have an interesting twist at the end."
4,Atmospheric and gripping.,"Christopher Nolan has surprised audiences with the follow-up to his mega-successful film Memento. While not as layered and intricately plotted as his first film, Insomnia stands on it's own as a wonderfully paced murder mystery. The setting for this film is the main star. Alaska has never looked more foreboding, cold, or alien as it does in this picture and the wonderful cinematography only adds to the tension of the piece. Al Pacino, as always, is wonderful as Det. Dormer, a man with a haunted past of mistakes, guilt ridden decision making, and a terrible infirmity: Insomnia. Robin Williams infuses his manical portrayal of a cold, caluculating killer with righteous aplomb: The demon next door. A few particularly weak plot devices fail to ruin the mystery of the film, and the script crackles with sharp dialogue. Highly recommended for mystery fans."
5,Great bargain for four really good movies,"At first, I received the packaging that had two, double-sided DVD's. I had to return them because two of the movies got to a certain chapter in the movie and then stopped, no matter what DVD player or computer I tried to use. Amazon was wonderfully simple to do a return, and I had my replacement in two days. There must have been a manufacturing error with the first one, because the second shipment came as four single-sided DVD's and they all played perfectly. I did not see these movies in the theater, and the heavily censored and edited TV versions are hopeless. It was really great to see these movies as they were originally meant to be seen. At this price, to get four quality movies is a real deal."
4,Good Acting Elevates This 'Sleeper',"Al Pacino's acting once again is a highlight of a film he's in. He has the capacity to dominate a film with his presence. In this re-make of the Norwegian film, Pacino is excellent as a good-yet-tainted policeman who starts to unravel after not sleeping for four or five days. The Alaskan summer, with light 24 hours of day, can do that to visitorsRobin Williams, meanwhile, plays a killer. It's funny how comedians can do so well playing dramatic roles and Williams is a prime example. He's especially good at creepy nut-cases (See ""One Hour Photo"") Williams doesn't enter the movie until about halfway through and he's fascinating in a low-key role (until the end).For a modern-day crime film, this doesn't have a lot of action but that's fine if the acting is this good and the story involving. Here, the acting is better than the story. Kudos to Hillary Swank, too, for her performance as the cop.The Alaskan scenery ain't bad, either."
3,1 TIME WATCHER,"INSOMNIA IS A 1 TIME WATCHER. THE FILM HAS MINUSES AND PLUSES. PERFORMENCE WISE,AL PACNIO IS EXTRAORDINARY.ROBIN WILLAMS UNDERPLAYS.HILLARY SWANK IS SUPERB!DESERVERS A 1 TIME WATCH."
2,Wait and Rent,"It's not a bad movie, but the scenery behind the opening credits is the best part. The plot is predictable and you never get emotionally attached to any of the characters. On some dreary weekend next winter this might be a nice choice for a rental, but for now, there are much better options."
5,Great movie!,"A great story and a great performance by both Robin Williams and Al Pacino. I love this movie. One of our favorites.I won't retell the plot synopsis because you can read that above and in other reviews. I will only say that I am not a big Pacino fan, I like him in some things and not others, but I love him in this. And while I've always loved Robin Williams, I strongly prefer him in dramatic roles than in manic comedic roles. This movie was perfect for him.Excellent all around!"
3,....Yawn...,"I dig Pacino. I am fanatic about Robin. But, I didn't even try to get the sleep Pacino wanted so dearly and was granted it while viewing this cine. Why? My problem: they should have given the uncredited role thing to Robin, which at least had given the movie more punch when you find out who's the killer. A la Spacey in Se7en. The mystery was supposed to drive the story more. How's the mystery gonna drive the story when you tell everyone who did it from the bat? Granted, the Midnight Sun and lack of sleep angle adds something to the drama, but seeing a sleepy, craggy, crabby Pacino go thru his contorsions made me a bit more drowsy than my fellow reviewers..."
4,Full of suspense...,"Insomnia works well with an excellent group of actors. I especially loved Hilary Swank's character; very friendly yet sharp. Al Pacino, of course, makes the movie. He is a skillful actor, but be prepared for profanity. Just like Gene Hackman turned nearly every movie he starred in into a profanity laden trip, so does Pacino. If you don't prefer certain four letter words, don't watch it or keep your finger on the mute button. Other than offensive language, this movie is a must-see. It keeps you guessing."
4,Great Flick,"I loved it. . . My Wife says it was slow. . but that's because she was way tired, and Pacino's Insomnia made it seem like we're tired too. THAT GOOD. . Williams was a great villian. . loveable at first, then sick and demented and definately evil.THE ONLY PROBLEM. . Being a Mr. Finch I hated that the evil guy was a ""FINCH"" ICK. . but that's only draw-back. . the plot moved VERY intensely and I thought it was gripping, amazingly intriguing and a moral dilema! GREAT FLICK. . only thing that's not a 5 star. . is the last name (laugh) and it was a little slow. . but is still a must see!!"
2,disappointed,"When it works it works very well, the design flaws previously mentioned are as stated. I have had this for 3 months and used it 3 times and the unloader valve has failed, what could be a ralatively easy fix is complicated by karcher. a google search finds that this is a common problem on this machine. It is impossible to obtain Karcher parts, they do not respond to emails and there number is busy. Other manufacturers in this price range have easily obtainable parts and are of equal or better quality. the fix appears to be to toss the Karcher pump and mount another brand on the motor ie; AR, Comet, Cat etc..."
4,Karcher 2400HH,"Just purchased the 2400hh at Costco. Tried it right away and was very impressed. No problems at start up or during use. I don't use pressure washers very often, but I can tell you that I have used a much more expensive Landa washer with a much higher hp rating and I could not tell much difference in performance. All the complaining about the oil fill is over-rated. I recommend this product, specially at this price point. Maintenance Supervisor in California."
1,Update on my K2400HH,"I finally got the unit back from the service center after they waited 3 weeks for parts. Based on their experience with Karcher, the service center advised me they will no longer work on them. With the ""new"" pump, the unloader now sticks whenever I release the wand trigger. I have to either reduce the engine RPM's or unscrew the nozzle to make it release. This happens EVERY time. Dealing with the company directly is a waste of time, and the service network is turning their backs on them. I can't emphasize enough how I regret the purchase."
1,dont wast your money,"cant find any place that will work on it. cant buy replacement parts . this is a big waste of money, buy something that can be worked on."
1,not worth it,"Since purchasing this item in April, it's never maintained high pressure for longer than 5 minutes at a time. I've been online, spoken with reps and done everything I know how to do to fix the problem and nothing works. Now I'm having to pay for a repair on this ""new"" item. I wouldn't even recommend this washer to someone I didn't like."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this because it LOOKS well-made and has a decent engine. Result? Mine didn't last 2 years, and with only light, intermittent use. The cost of replacing the pump and accessories with something actually worth replacing them with actually exceeds the cost of the entire unit! Pay another $150 - $200 and get something with a better pump. It's worth it in the long run ... or, in this case, the short run. A very reasonable alternative isNorthStar Pressure Washer - 2800 PSI, 2.5 GPMPumps, plumbing, hoses, connectors, and wands are everthing on a pressure washer. Don't buy based on the engine brand alone."
2,Don't buy this unit. Pumps are junk,I have owned this unit for about 3 years. It has been use about 8 times. After I bought it a friend warned me that the pumps on these unit's are junk. I didn't believe her till today.No pressure! Bad unloader valve. Karcher is is loosing customers with this unit. Instead of addressing the problem they hide.
1,Karcher Unit a Disappointment,"Purchased a K2400HH unit from Costco for light use around the yard. The Honda engine works like a champ--but the pump is the pits. After only a year, the pump will not engage unless you hold the pressure handle wide open WHILE STARTING--i.e. if you let off the handle while washing and then open it up, the pump will not restart UNLESS you power off the engine. Karcher support was worthless. Local dealer said it would cost as much to repair the pump as buy a new one. I will shift brands on the next sprayer."
1,Karcher doesn't care about widely reported design flaw.,"I wish it was possible to give a product zero or negative stars!Soon after I bought this machine in June, 2003, I gave it a glowing review for it's great performance to price ratio. I too experienced the frequent and aggravating pressure losses caused by a defectively designed ""unloader valve"" as widely reported here. Karcher will not step up and do the right thing to deal with this obvious, indisputably faulty design.The strong Honda engine will make a great motor for my kid's go-kart. The rest of the Karcher machine is headed for the dumpster."
4,Great Buy - Compared to the others,"I was shopping for a pressure washer for my husband as a gift, I really had no idea how many choices I was going to have for pressure washers. I chose Karcher for quality and price, I read alot of good info on this product. My husband was happy with my choice, he said the machine was perfect, he also found parts diagrams and hard to find accessories on www.karcherparts.com. I think this is a great buy!!"
4,health and medical knowledge for men,"although i found it sometimes filled with too many charts and medical terminolog, this book provided me with info on a subject that i needed exact info about. therefore, it is an excellent reference book to hold onto"
5,Very pretty,"These are very gorgeous, very delicate earrings. The length is quite long, about chin length, but they're so light weight you hardly notice them in. Seller is quick to ship and I was overall very pleased with their product!!Sarah Beesleywww.scentsy.com/beesley"
5,Darling,"These are the cutest! I gave them to my niece for her 16th birthday, but I'll be honest, I wanted to keep them for myself."
3,Product served it's purpose..,"While I was very pleased with the price, quick shipping and precise instructions to install, there is a lot of shake when rolling down the road. I may have returned had I not needed it to pass inspection. And I also find it very unfair that the customer generally has to pay return shipping."
1,Out of stock ?,I'm just a little disappointed that the item I ordered showed in stock up until the day I received the email from Amazon.com telling me the item was canceled due to being out of stock after waiting almost a weekThanks ???
3,Gotti,The movie had its moments some of the dialogue was hard to understand but the acting was fine. Assante and Quinn both were very good in their roles. It's worth buying if your into mafia movies.
3,GOTTI? where i dont see him?,"i first reconized gotti as the boss of Sammy ""The bull"" Gravano, i have been doing alot of reading on the man, found him (gravano) intresting. it seems that Gotti, in the movie, is glamorized alot more then should be. every one likes the arogant bast***, but really he was the boss of the most pwerful ""Mafia"" family in new york he didnt get there from kissing butt okay? he got there from Killing ppl who ""upset"" him. inculding his own boss, Big paul. i have to say is i am a big Cosa Nostra fan <like movies and wut not> but truely i am DANG NEAR sure this isnt the person who he really was. I dunno about any other movies or books (other then Gravano's book ""underboss"" wich is REALLY good but then again its in his words, he isnt gonna make himself look that bad) on him because i have only started my reseach and i am more focused on Gravano but u might like ""Gotti"" but keep in mind this isnt an acurate portrayal of the man."
2,"Gotti, Too Interesting to make things up","Entertaining? Yes, but way off base. If you read, read Underboss, or The Rise and Fall of the Gambino Crime Family. If you read these books, and then watch Gotti, you will see how underdeveloped this movie is. You don't need to embelish to man a man like Gotti seem interesting."
1,Gotti= Uplifting?,"Gotti seems to have gone down viewers throats well with the lies and fiction told. To be bold, it is all fiction! It makes Gotti look like the pope. Or so it tries to! However, the only reason this can even get a one is because of the actor's excellent ability in such a poor and bleak script! However, this may only be because I have seen so many mafia flicks before and know the good and bad!So, if you want to watch it it is your choice. However, be prepared for hogwash!!"
3,With you till the end.......................................,"It's a notable rise and fall of New York crime boss John Gotti a.k.a The Dapper Don. The Dapper Don's rise through the ranks of the Gambino crime family, was first through the support of his mentor, and then through a bold ass assassination of Paul,The Gambino's current boss.Gotti is the man...New Yorkers all love him! He's changing the rules of the family, as well as making the news and the cover of magazines. ""Man of the Year!""Gotti's world comes crashing around him as his arrogance over beating the government on a rico charge, as well as his thirst for the limelight.The Dapper ""Don"" is caught on tape revealing Sammy as a notorious killer. I told ya'll men talk 2 much! Loose lips Sammy gets up on the stand an co-signs with the man against Gotti! Wouldn't you know it...mob underboss, reputed murderer steps to the stand and corroborates.The Don is doing LIFE.....Fed joint in Chi~townIt was okay, not explosive..."
2,Armand Assante makes me ill,"A fictional tale... Armand Assante plays the same character the same way with the same accent in every movie - POORLY. Armand once again proves he's a one trick pony w/ his portrayal of the John Gotti character. Hey Armand, take acting lessons."
1,this is bad business,you shouldn't sell scratched up movies. You should check them before you sell them. That Gotti movie is all scratched up i cant even watch it
3,Mediocre HBO movie,"Yes, it's a low budget mafia movie...Okay...Okay...Maybe all mafia movies are low budget, but what I mean to say is that no big gunshot scenes, nothing like that goes on in this one. Nevertheless it's got a good storyline...and the fact that it's based on a true story definitely helps. If anything, Armand Assante carries this movie through, the other actors have done better in other movies, but I cant say I've seen Armand assante in a better role than this, he definitely made this whole movie watchable. Truth is that the more you see the movie the better your opinion of it will be. It's one of those that grows on you."
4,"""Gotti"" Review","As we all know by the other reviews, this movie isn't 100% accurate. Other than that, it was a great movie! You can find it for $5 now, even! It's well worth the watch, plus this is a movie all mafia-fans should have in their collection! I would recommend buying this one!"
3,All About John Gotti,"This movie focuses a LOT more on just the actual man John Gotti rather than all the affect he has. Armand Assante is very convincing and did an excellent job acting. However, unlike The Godfather, this is a REAL story. That makes it all the more fun to watch. It's definitely worth watching if you're a gangster movie addict like meIt's definitely no Godfather, but if you're looking for something new...give it a shot"
3,Gotti is no Don Corleone.,"This movie is pretty good considering that it portrays Gotti as some intellectual genius of mafia strategy. The actors couldn't have been better, but come on, why does this movie portray Sammy the Bull as such a murderous small timer? I mean, the man made more money than Gotti ever did before he was boss. The movie would be better if it concentrated on the actual facts of Gotti's rise, which it rarely does. Read some books on Gotti, Gravano, and the Gambino Family before you watch this so at least you'll know what really happened. That way you won't believe this Gotti propaganda, and can enjoy this film as to what it ACTUALLY is; fictional entertainment."
3,fun film; bad history,"Chronologically, this film does a fine job of portraying events in the life of John Gotti. As a biography, however, it is awful. Gotti, by any objective measure an immoral thug who brought about his own demise, is portrayed in the film as a great guy around whom bad things are done by others. Gotti, not Gravano, was responsible for the murder of the neighbor who accidentally killed his son. To suggest, as the film does, that he was ignorant of the jury-tampering on his behalf that occurred during one of his trials is equally absurd. In short, respect Gotti or not, the real man is nothing like what is portrayed in the HBO film."
3,Sold As New But Wasn't,I dont believe the item I bought was fit into new status. All DVD's have some sortof plastic packaging and or security labels. This did not. If I wanted used I couldhave saved a few bucks instead of paying into the new classification.
3,Gotti,"I enjoyed watching this movie. Good story, great subject and solid acting.However, the movie isn't accurate. People who know a lot about Cosa Nostra and Gotti's life may be disappointed. A lot of things are made up (the killing of Favara in some tunnel, for instance). I don't understand why the makers didn't stick to the facts. It's not like the facts are boring. There a only two possible reasons for this: bad research and/or the romanticizing of Gotti. Gotti is made out to be the good guy. I know a lot about Cosa Nostra, I've read many books on the subject and I've seen video/audio tapes of John Gotti. Assante is a good actor, but he certainly did not capture the real Gotti. Tom Sizemore does a better job playing Gotti in the movie ""Witness to the mob"". So if you're willing to overlook a lot of details, you're in for a good time."
5,Human tissue sources,"Excellent resource. No other such comprehensive reviews of human tissue sources exist. The authors did an excellent job putting together a consice, easy to read manual. Should be on every biomedical researchers desk."
2,Smells great but not worth the $,"I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner because my salon is now using Bumble and Bumble products and my stylist was raving about the products. The coconut smell is great but the shampoo and conditioner are just ok. I thought that it would make my hair smooth and give it more shine, but my hair feels like I am using a cheap supermarket brand shampoo. Also, my forehead seems to be a little on the oily side since I started using these products. I normally have very dry skin with no blemishes. I am kinda disappointed because I spent $50 on both the shampoo and conditioner. I wouldn't buy these again..."
2,BUMBLE TAKES A TUMBLE IN MY ESTIMATION,"While Bumble and Bumble used to be one of my favorite lines of hair care products, this conditioner (and I might add shampoo by the same name) was a real disappointment.Using it left no softening or conditioning effect and there wasn't even a pleasant scent. Don't know where Bumble fumbled but they certainly fouled up on this one. I'm saving my $$$$$ for Lush and Frederic Fekkai!- Gail Cooke"
3,eh....,"It seemed just like a normal conditioner There was nothing fantastic about it, expect for the smell. And the price for it is ridiculous, i spent 40 bucks on both the shampoo and conditioner, for those tiny little bottles, that are pretty much travel size. The price is not worth the quantity that you get for it."
1,Bumble & Bumble Creme de Coco Conditioner,I have used this product before and loved it. It did not seem like the same product. It smelled like Suave instead of the rich coconut smell I usually associate with this product. I will buy the product from a retail store or directly from Bumble and Bumble in the future.
1,Disappointing,"It doesn't really help dry hair and only has a faint smell of coconut. Not worth the money. Do yourself a favour and save money, get the Suave professional conditioner which works as well if not better for a tenth of the price."
2,Not good,"The Creme de Coco conditioner is horrible. (I always buy from a salon mind you) It leaves your hair feeling waxy and the conditioner doesn't absorb into the hair follicle. It smells ok. I'm not a fan. I have medium texture and long hair with highlights. I'm using Pureology now, much better. I must say though that the Creme de Coco Shampoo is awesome, but the conditioner-not so much!"
5,Soooo creamy,"The Creme de Coco is a pretty thick conditioner that is GREAT for de-tangling hair. In fact, I think it's the only conditioner that actually has worked (for me) in terms of de-tangling. Because it's really thick, I don't leave it on very long b/c I don't want to weigh down my somewhat fine hair, but it's the only conditioner I use! It's so thick it even lathers a little bit."
3,"""ok""","I have used B&B products in the past with ""ok"" results. Despite the price, I decided to try Creme De Cocoa because my hair tends to be dry, and it is wavy so when I dry it straight, I often get ""pouf"". I do not wash my hair every day, I also have highlights. The conditioner is ok, . It smells great. It just didn't seem to do anything spectacular to my hair to justify the price. It's ""ok"". I probably won't get it again though."
5,Best conditioner,"Love this conditioner. Just tried another b&b conditioner, but was dissapointed, so now I'm sticking with the tried and true."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! FAKE PRODUCT!,"I have bought this product for years from my salon. I thought I would buy it online to save a trip to my salon. Considering how often I use this product, I noticed right away that the color was off. Then when I used it, it was obvious that the product was fake considering the consistency was very different. Finally when I used it, my hair was full of knots and unusually dry. I'm disappointed that I bought two bottles. Please, please be aware that Deal Seakers is selling FAKE Bumble and Bumble products! Unacceptable."
4,"O.K., so shoot me! I actually like this guy!","What can I say except this SACD is full of positives: Motown, MichaelMcDonald's great voice, wonderful song selection (remember when people actually wrote ""real songs""?) incredible musicianship and top-notch production. A home run on every level!"
3,the mix,The musical performance is terrific. However the 5:1 mix is not as spectacular as I'd hoped for.
5,M.McD. in super 5.1 audio,"I am a big M.McD. fan, an when I picked up my second copy of Motown in SACD, I was blown away. With the right system and speakers you hear things that you don't hear on the origonal CD realese. To hear M.McD. voice coming through the center channel, you can hear the power and smoothness of his voice shinning through. Every instrument comes through clear. Right down to the chimes on ""Reflections"". There are alot of fans of music who knock down sacd format. If you don't have top quality player and GOOD QUALITY 6 channel input rca connects, and speakers positions right the sound will be off. For all the nasayers about SACD, please retune your ears and take another spin. PS. having sub bass makes you feel the bass lines and drums. I vote to realese Mike's solo Albums and Doobie Brother albums on SACD fromat...."
2,Do We Need More Motown Covers?,"We obviously are not getting the type of new material our better singers need anymore. With Rod Stewart, Aaron Neville and Boz Scaggs reaching back to Cole Porter and Ron Isley to Burt Bacharach, it seems that we're doomed to endless rehashs and recycles.Michael McDonald's voice has always cried out for strong soul material (check his work on ""The New York Rock & Soul Review""). Here he covers mostly Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and the material is strong. His voice is solid and always interesting, but in the end you have to keep asking yourself - do we need another Motown cover album? No new ground is broken here and in the end, bringing over your old Motown records is more satisfying."
4,Great information,"I really like the detail that this book has, as well as the fabulous pictures. The pictures not only of works in progress, but beautiful, finished works as well, often demonstrating the technique being presented. Thanks for a wonderful resource."
2,one TOTALLY awsum song..,THe only good song on this album is Trauerbrandung.. if this were a single i would give it a 5 but the other songs sux..
3,Works,I have not owned this long enough to rate it effectively - I just got it. I like the long handle on it so I can reach the center of the roof on my truck.I believe this thing would work good on a motorhome or big rig.
5,Gave one as a gift,"I had a California Super Duster and used it for my sports car. It did such a great job getting the dust off without scratching the finish, I ordered one as a gift."
3,A little to heavy,"I have used California dusters for years and loved them. This super duster is too heavy for me to use with ease. For a large man, this would be the ideal duster."
5,Great car duster,More than one of my friends have recommended this product. Snowbirding in Mesa AZ for 5 months each year you find out that Mesa leave dust on most things left out doors every 2 - 3 days. This California duster does a great job picking up that thin film of dust on the vehicle.
4,super duty,"We have owned three of the original dusters, which are still in use. This one does cover more surface area, no hard surface exposed in dusting area but as said before it is heavier. But that is why it is called the ""super."""
2,What I think.,"Since this book is targeted for a 9-12 year old audience, I'm not too surprised that it reads like a watered-down script for an episode of ""Scooby-Doo"" (not the old classic stuff....I mean the stuff AFTER ""Scrappy-Doo"" and company showed up). Giant ticks were creepy and disgusting. Overuse of the word ""friend"" was even more so. Me thinks that Mr. Author needs a thesaurus. Perhaps as this series goes along, the intelligence level may go up a little. It is good to see someone interested in reviving and updating the stories. I would rather see it back in Visaria instead of Florida. Thank you Abbott & Costello for messing it up."
2,Peculiar spiciness,"I had to give the whole case away. These things have a bizarre heat to them. There's no black pepper to be found, so I don't know where it's coming from. It's like capsaicin or something was just sprayed onto them. I don't mind spiciness one bit, but as far as I'm concerned, it's not a legitimate thing to have in a Caesar crouton. Yuck."
5,Don't forget Manhattans!,"These cherries are wonderful for all the uses listed in the other reviews but don't forget about using these to add extra class to Manhattans. We have a couple excellent restaurants/bars here in Scottsdale that use these rather than maraschino cherries and now we're hooked. To make them even better than they are when they come out of the jar, remove about half the syrup (save it for other things) and fill with brandy and/or cognac. After a few days you'll have wonderful brandied cherries which can still be used as ice cream topping etc, but again, a must for those Manhattans--even if you make your Manhattan's with whiskey like we do (Crown Royal even better). I will agree with one other reviewer, it's ashame that Amazon continues to sell these for $5 more than Taylors Market which is where they get them from. I thought maybe the price would even out if you compared them after shipping charges, but they're still about $5 different."
1,Flo & Go,"Overall quality of the tank itself is OK. However, the nozzle hose came loose at the tank end after only a couple of weeks, spilling gas all over me. The hose really needs to be fitted with some kind of clamp rather than just a push-on force. Plus the hose itself is a cheap plastic type tending to easily collapse. I'm in the process of purchasing a true automotive quality fuel hose with clamps. Bottom line is I would not have puchased this item had I known about this serious shortcoming. For the relatively high price charged the design and quality should have been better."
2,Needs Improving,A design that still needs work. The plastic hose collapsed the first time I ran gas through it. The short hose on the inside of the tank got soft and fell off into the tank. They need to improve the quality of their materials to make this item usable. I bought some better hose and it works much better. There is a gas smell in the garage. I don't know if it is from the fuel left in the hose\ handle or that the valve does not fit very tight to the tank so that might be where the evaporation is coming from. I have to remove the siphon apparatus and cap normally when storing.I would not recommend this product until improvements are made.
2,Held the children's interest throughout,"When I read this book myself, I frankly thought it was a little boring, but I was happy to see the children paid attention from beginning to end. I read it to a group of seven 6 to 8-year-old boys. They appeared to be most interested in counting the stars on each page (and then arguing about the tally!) but when we talked about it afterwards, I found they really had been listening to the words. The paintings are beautiful."
2,Enormous,"Having burned many a mitt, these heat-resistant mitts are a great concept...except they are way too wide and my smaller female hands slip around in them. It is hard to fold my palm to grasp, and thus far I have been so afraid of dropping a hot item that I haven't used them. It's not worth paying to ship them back...sigh."
4,Great product for thick hair,"This product is great if you use how it is instructed (with coordinating shampoo) or have extremely thick and or dry hair. When used properly, this is a great product for color upkeep."
1,doesn't work,"I have tried everything I can think of, but this just will NOT put color on my eyes. There are definitely better products out there, though these colors are very inviting... Too bad they don't work."
1,Why so costly?,"I was considering buying this book for my mother with Alheimer's but find it too expensive for a book that will likely end up ""misplaced"". Why would a book cost so much?"
4,"Fun Show, Good Memories","Yes, the price may be more than some shows, the same as others, and lower than some. The point is the studio found a structure that would allow this to be released. We've waited many years for Love Boat to come to DVD and if you decide not to spend a few extra dollars then you are telling the studio you don't want the Love Boat on DVD, and they will stop releasing them. Of course I wish they were less expensive, and full seasons, but I like the show and am happy to own the episodes. Ranting about half seasons and high costs will NOT change how these are being released. It will only guarantee them to no longer be released."
2,"Nice Shows, lousy packaging","When I opened the case, the two ""holders"" on which the DVD's were mounted, were sliding around, and there were pieces of the mechanism all over the case. Some of them looked as if they were broken. I was on the point of returning the item but could not decide whether I wanted a credit or the same thing again. Fortunately I have an ingenious son who was able to put the whole thing back together again. He convinced me that there were no broken parts, but that the whole mechanism had just fallen apart.Now every time I want to play one of those DVDs, I am handling the case with kid gloves so that such an accident does not happen again. But I do hope that I never see this type of mechanism again. For that reason I will refrain from buying future seasons and forego the pleasure of seeing more episodes of this nostalgic show, just in case they are packaged the same way.The show itself deserves at least 4 stars, the deduction is for the packaging."
1,RIPOFF!!! DON'T BUY!!!,"People, you DON'T have to let yourself get ripped off by this half-season scheme. Compare this to Dallas, which was a MUCH more popular and expensive show, and you can buy most of the full season packs for less than $25 per season. Same goes for several other TV shows from the same era as Love Boat. Contact Paramount and let them know how angry you are a them for trying to rip you off. There's NO WAY I'm going let them rip ME off with this stupid scheme. It's only a TV show. I'll wait till they release it the way I want it and until then they don't get a penny from me."
4,love boat,I enjoyed the video that was sent to me very well. I just wish you had it in vhs format as well. I know vhs is outdated but it would be wonderful if we could still get videos that are on dvd also in vhs format seeing there are some of us who still own vcrs. And I would prefer a vcr or vhs video over a dvd disc. Dvds have a tendency if they don't read right they stop or skip a lot where the video version the only thing you have to worry about if the tape is to get eaten by the machine otherwise they could last a lot longer. I still own all my videos from the time I got my very first vcr and there are many things on them that could never be found on a dvd. Sandy.
5,"Love Boat Season 2, Vol 1","I can hardly wait for Vol 2!! We understand dividing up the seasons. Love Boat was not only an hour show, but also had a 2 hour season premier movie to kick off the season! I once again love seeing stars such as John Astin, Dick Martin, Melissa Gilbert, Robert Urich to name a few! You get a 2 hour movie and 12 episodes in Vol 1. Come on Vol 2!!!"
3,no way to treat fans,I was really disappointed. After the long wait and split seasons they could done a better job at putting the show on DVD. The colors flashed for real to yellow and back again. Some of the show flashed from crystal clear to fuzzy then back again. This is not the way to treat loyal fans. They would have no money coming in if enough people would not buy due to this poor presentation and excess cost due to split seasons. I gave 3 stars because I admit I'm a die hard fan of the show and the episodes are still great.
3,Fairly amusing,"Like most of his films of late, Woody Allen's ""Hollywood Ending"" was panned by the critics, but it's actually fairly amusing. One of Allen's self-described ""trifles,"" it casts the Woodman as a down on his luck director whose ex-wife persuades studio boss Treat Williams to give him one last shot at directing a major film. On the eve of production, he goes blind, a psychosomatic response to the way the plot parallels his personal life.It's popular to suggest that since hitting 60, Allen's comic timing is off, but I laughed frequently as the blind director fumbled his way across the film set and engaged in conversation while facing an empty seat on the sofa rather than the person he's addressing. The movie within the movie turns out to be a disaster, of course, but it's hailed by the French critics. The ending mirrors Allen's own career these days. Once the fair-haired boy of American critics, Allen must now go abroad to find a receptive audience.Brian W. Fairbanks"
4,Worth going to Blockbuster for!,"One night, I had nothing to do and no new movies to watch, so I drove down to Blockbuster to see what I could find. Being a Woody Allen fan, this movie caught my eye, so I rented it. It was light, meaningless and entertaining; which is fine. So yes, this movie isn't histarical, it isn't Allen's best, but it kept me laughing at a few parts, for example: When Val (Allen) is talking over a drink with his ex-wife, (who had just hired him to direct a movie since he had been in a creative slump for a while) and goes from talking about the movie to ""Why did you lieave me for that-that beverly hills j-erk? I think the movie will turn out great, I think Hal will be impressed."" So maybe it's not the best movie, but it's worth a rent."
5,"Wow, i really liked this movie.","This movie was a very funny movie. I liked woddy allen in this one a lot (as i have seen most of his other works). As with any woody allen movie, there is some sexual references, but other then that it seems appropiate for young audiances. The whole concept of the movie is very funny, and i found myself laughing a lot. Basically its about a director who gets a final chance to make a movie, something happens to him that prevents him from being able to see the movie, and its a total disaster. At the end he re-unites with his x-wife and they live happily......This was not boring, and progressed right along. There were not many special/visual effects, and not much noticible music(the music blended right in with the movie). This is ok though, as a movie of this type does not need Speical music and Spectacular effects.To any woody allen fan, this is a must watch.~Hope this helps"
2,A Mish-Mash,"This movie had the feel of being a mish-mash of second-rate material that got dumped in this movie. That said the shooting and scenery are excellent, there are some good, funny scenes and both Tea Leoni and Debra Messing are terrific."
3,Not as good as Allens other films...,"Val Waxman (Woody Allen), once a great film director, is now shooting commercials in Canada for a living, which he despises with a passion. One day he receives an offer through his agent to revive his former status as a great director by directing a 60 million dollar film that is produced by his ex-wife's boyfriend. This is very upsetting for Val, however, Val swallows his pride since this is a chance to get back into the film industry. Nevertheless, problems arise that are of immense magnitude. Val loses his vision through psychosomatic trauma. Hollywood Ending is a film that generates some smiles and laughs, but the big picture is a rather disappointing film by Woody Allen that falls flat at the end."
3,Woody being Woody,"In ""Hollywood Ending"" we are served a generous portion of Woody portraying Woody, or at least how he sees himself. He's a neurotic genius, a New Yorker to the bone, too sophisticated to be drawn into La-la life styles of the other coast. Tea Leoni has a difficult role as his former wife, who in the process of steering him safely through directing a Hollywood megabudget hit, finds her love for him resurrected.The boneheaded plot device of Allen psychosomatically losing his sight is not well done. He consistently turns his head away from those speaking. Would he not hear the direction of their voices?You will need a ""willing suspension of disbelief"" to enjoy this movie."
2,A So-So Film...,"I'm a fan of Woody Allen movies, but this one disappointed me. The premise had real possibilities too, a temporarily blind man attempting to direct a movie, but he never made much of it. ""Small Time Crooks"", ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"", and ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" are his funniest movies in my opinion."
3,Val Really Loses It...,"Val Waxman (Woody Allen), once a great film director, is now shooting commercials in Canada for a living, which he despises with a passion. One day he receives an offer through his agent to revive his former status as a great director by directing a 60 million dollar film that is produced by his ex-wife's boyfriend. This is very upsetting for Val, however, Val swallows his pride since this is a chance to get back into the film industry. Nevertheless, problems arise that are of immense magnitude. Val loses his vision through psychosomatic trauma. Hollywood Ending is a film that generates some smiles and laughs, but the big picture is a rather disappointing film by Woody Allen that falls flat at the end."
2,resignation,"Hollywood Ending is better than Woody Allen's last two films, but that makes it...what? His third-worst ever. All I can say for it is that it wasn't as excruciatingly awful as Small Time Crooks and Curse of the Jade Scorpion, but it still WASN'T FUNNY. Is there anything sadder than a Woody Allen movie that's neither funny nor intellectually stimulating? I've seen all but three of Woody Allen's movies, but unfortunately that's now three too many. Reviewer David Edelstein's analysis was that Woody is trying hard now to cater to his audience but has no respect for that audience: the result is trash. Can we hope that he'll pull out of this hole? Of course we can hope. But we shouldn't get those hopes up."
2,A Big Waste from the Woodman.,"....eh. i usually enjoy Woody (Manhattan, Hannah and her Sisters, Manhattan Murder Mystery, Mighty Aphrodite), but Allen's writing needs an enema. It's weird, i actually enjoyed the PLOT of this film MORE than the dialogue (which is usually the opposite of past Woody Allen films for me). Problems abound in the film though, most notably Tea Leoni and Woody Allen have ZILCH chemistry (which is paramount to the story), and the ending seems put on fast forward. I did enjoy the light comedic moments alot though (and was surprised at how often i laughed at jokes about blindness), and george hamilton and debra messing are cute in supporting roles...."
3,Good film,"This is a funny film and has some fine performances from all involved.Woody has some great one liners and neurotically stumbles metaphorically and literally (he goes psychosomatically blind) through the movie.The movie can tend to drag a little in places, but there is enough witty exchanges to keep it ticking along nicely and then leave you with a feel good Hollywood ending.Obviously not in the calibre of his finest work, but still very much worth the ride."
4,Diverting and Amusing,"I've always been a fan of Woody Allen's films, his personal life notwithstanding. His latest is a wry and amusing twist on the ins and outs of the film industry, told from a viewpoint only an insider like Allen could have. Lots of jokes here about a blind director (""what was he, blind?"") and his romantic foibles, and some hysterical physical humor of Allen's that recalls the best of his ""Sleeper"" era work.Not to be missed for a fan, entertaining for most of the rest of us."
2,barely 2 stars,"in what world would a 70 yr old like feeble and child like have a chance with Téa Leoni? well only in his own films where he puts himself into the lead as the leading man that women want. as only in his films could this b possible and this was one of his clunkers. slow at many times. couldnt believe it not even for a woody allen film. the actors over act as if someone yelled 'overact,you re in a woody allen film'. and debra messing is a one note actress to me and if i hear her do her 'snort' thing again will b too soon. who ever told her that was endearing? george hamilton does nothing in this film. the others just barely. this def is a one viewing film only if you want to compare the good (zelig, interiors, broadway danny rose) to the bad (curse, celebrity, anything else) to see the ups n downs of his career."
1,Still a fan despite this film,"I have been enjoying Woody's films since I was about 14. This is the only film I can say falls a tad short of engaging in his extensive career as (arguably) the only living comic genius writer/director today. If you are a fan, take a look, you will still find one or two moments of hilarity. If its your first, start anywhere but here."
2,Wonderful Music...weak edits,"The track listing shown is deceiving. All but one of the the tracks are ""clean"" edits, and they're listed that way on the CD case... It sounds like the CD skips!..really poor editting. It's amazing to me that a label run by one of Body & Soul's own DJs (where this song was regularly played...uneddited) would bother to put these versions out. Sad."
5,progressive yet basic,"very refreshing back to bassline and vocal blend of house, soul and jazz. you can hear the sex in the music...and it sounds good!"
1,Fontographer purchase,"The description of the product did not state that it is not compatible with the latest versions of Microsoft Windows such as XP, Vista, or 7. The product can only be ran on very old Windows versions. In addition to that the Book condition was listed as ""Excellent"". In reality the book has damaged corner and a lot of hand written and underlining remarks. I have put a dispute with my credit card customer service after the seller offerer my $15.00 discount."
2,"Not bad, just not what I was looking for.","I thought it would have a lot of real space footage. It was mostly astronauts training here on earth and even computer graphics of space. Again, not what I was looking for."
1,First 3 minutes are not in 3D!,"I purchased Space Station 3D this morning and I'm hoping somebody from Warner Video sees this.There is a problem with the 3D formatting of this film. The film is supposed to be 3d from start to finish, but on this disc, the film is not stereo 3D until 3:13 into the film. Both the ""left-eye"" and ""right-eye"" images are the same up to that point.Since the film goes from 2D to 3D between shots, this is probably an issue with how the left and right video tracks were prepped for 3D encoding, since my player registers a true 3D video track from the start. I'm very familiar with this film and with 3D post-production and there is a major QC issue with this title.-Mike"
3,somewhat boring,"this dvd was more boring than i thought. i bought it after reading a bunch of reviews about it. most people gave it great reviews. but after watching it, i thought it was somewhat boring. i mean, i've seen worse, but it was pretty dull. there also weren't too many moments where the 3d effects looked that great. i picked this dvd out because i wanted something good in 3d to watch on my new 3d tv. but there were only a couple of moments that looked good. this dvd was only ok."
2,Not worth the $$,I was a little disappointed because I thought it would have had more pics of earth and other planets etc. Was however very interesting seeing the inside of the space station and how it works.
3,No 3D in the first 3.5 minutes!!!!!!,"I just saw this film for the first time since it was out in IMAX and the first 3.5 minutes of the Bluray 3D was not in 3D. I could've sworn it was 3D when I saw it in IMAX. Other than that, the rest of the film's 3D was good. Some parts had major ""ghosting"" but overall, the 3D effects were spectacular. The scenes in the space station were vivid and made you almost feel like you were there. I will say that this Bluray was far too short for the price but with very little 3D content out on the market, I just had to buy it to utilize this tech.If only you could rent (instead of purchase) this Bluray... Or wait for it on Fios/Comcast 3D?"
4,Excellent 3D quality,"Quality of the 3D footage is outstanding./ The story is good but sometimes drags and leaves you wanting for something more than the film delivered.Footage of the first Soyuz launch was spectacular. But, having witnessed many spectacular, live shutlle launches, the film missed a golden opportunity by omitting any footage of a shuttle launch.After a while, the film tends to drag thru more boring shots of crewmembers floating thru the station, sleeping, etc.However, the incredible 3D photography more than offsets that negative."
3,"Interesting, but slow","This was a very interesting movie with great footage, but it is very slow. I bought it hoping to show it to my 7th grade students, but it barely kept my attention so I know it won't keep their's."
3,Very Nice Images of the Space Station and Launches,Space Station is a feel good DVD and to that end it accomplishes its mission. It is a historic documentary of how the Space Station was intitially built and the adaptation of the first ISS Expedition crews. The DVD fails to set forth the real topology in the future of the multinational space effort other than to say it will be a model for how multinational space crews will adapt to long missions. The focus appears to be on the human engineering feat as opposed to its space utility.
2,The Space Between,"This video is interesting and some of the footage is quite nice but, it is severly lacking as a 3D experience. Some of the scenes aren't even in 3D or it is so poor it doesn't appear they are; there were only a handful of scenes that made me exclaim...""WOW""!!!!Not recommended, I feel taken, which is unexpected for an IMAX film."
3,Almost,The ghosting in this IMAX title is a bit much at times - really distracting. You'll notice it big time when filming is on the space station.The image suffers also from distortion (Look at people's faces - they appear squished).I was hoping this would be as good as some other IMAX titles that I own but alas it is not. I'm certain it looked fantastic on the big screen.
5,Yeeeha - excellent,"This was my favorite 3D title until AVATAR came out... Visually superb, interesting, and the audio is tremendous. Very worthwhile."
4,Shuttle takeoff shakes the house,"Shuttle video and sould n a good home theater is fantastic. Story is a bit weak, kind of like a somewhat booring docuentary. 3D is effective, but not outstanding, except fo a few parts. A must buy if you are a space geek, otherwise, you might not make it through he whole video.Worth what I paid for it."
3,Seeing Stars,A lot of money to pay for a small amount of 3D content making it less worthy of the price. Sure there was content but apart from a few scenes the content in 3D did not matter much. Interesting topic but a bit dated for 2012.
5,Amazing,One of the best 3-D documentaries around. I saw this years ago in the theater and it has lost none of its wonder in translating to home 3-D. The 3-D really brings home what it is like to be inside the International Space Station and live and work there. This is a great use of 3-D that really brings it home.
3,3D effect is not that great,"Compared to other 3D titles this film was blurry, had lots of ghosting, and gave me a headache. I remember it looking great in the IMAX theater though. But at home it sucks compared to Under the Sea and other 3D titles."
4,Author paints picturesque Appalachian landscape,"As in her book, ""When I Was Young in the Mountains,"" Cynthia Rylant's ""Night in the Country"" paints a picturesque landscape of Appalachia. Warm country nights, cool breezes, fireflies and other common sights highlight this book. The art is beautifully calming."
5,the poetry of night time,"An awesome, quiet book. Rylant appreciates the simple beauty of night time sounds, from a creaking house getting comfortable for rest to an old pig rolling over in the straw to a sleeping dog's chain clinking. All quiet sounds that deserve observation. What initially caught my eye was the reference to a screen door closing in the night and the wonder of who might be up that late--I have often thought about things like that and I appreciated someone else's observation of the same thing. And what sold me on the book is when my four-year-old, after several months of none-interest in the book suddenly asked if I would read this book so he could wonder too about the person whose screen door closed in the night--obviously, Rylant's poetry in her prose is endearing and indelible. Szilagyi's artwork is appropriate to the text, neither overwhelming or boring. She has a nice, sublte touch that complement's the poetry of the book. Highly recommended"
3,expected more from the DVD,"worth $30? I respect how they control their art- but I bought this expecting more, well, art. The DVD consists of released videos, I haven't found anything new - yet. The layout is somewhat cryptic, as it should be if there is lots of material. I just don't think there's lots of material. I haven't listened to the CD much yet, but what I have heard so far is good. Overall, this seems worth the price of a live CD, but not a multimedia package."
2,Limited Edition.... not limited enough,"I'm glad the other reviewers enjoy it so much. I do like Tool. I was obviously expecting too much from these guys musicaly. If it weren't for the videos I would have given this 1 star. Bottom line.... it's good for a completing a Tool collection, but don't buy it for the music or you'll be disappointed."
4,"It was a great cd, but it was lacking something.","I am the first person to flock to something TOOL records. However, this one left me wanting more of the passion for the music which Maynard showed in his previous recordings. All in all, this was a nice addition to ""ye 'ole TOOL collection"". So i gave it four stars, but be warned i am partial..."
4,Poetry in Motion...,"I didnt think to much for the dvd, I thought there was alot more they could of done with it. but the live tracks on this are amazing, and they (tool) continue to show me they are by far the best modern band. the live version of Push it is amazing, make sure you take that one in fully. over all. well worth the money, and I cant wait for the new studio ablum to come out, it was so nice of them to tease us with putting the date on the front of its release... My mouth is for sure watering!!!"
1,"The Salival ""VINYL"" (BOOTLEG) review","Okay, 1st, I Love the album Salival.... it gets 4 Stars. The ""Product"" I'm reviewing however, gets ONE Star... because for those of you who don't know and are thinking of buying THIS version of it, DON'T!.Tool NEVER made a Vinyl edition of Salival... IT IS A BOOTLEG, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.I first saw this nonsense pop up on eBay a few years ago... and for the life of me, can't understand why Amazon would now allow it here, considering they have a much better understanding of Tool's TRUE ""Catalog""... but whatever.If you're a fan, or looking for a gift for a fan... DO NOT BUY ""SALIVAL"" in *Vinyl/LP* form because it is a poorly made, poorly designed, **BOOTLEG**.Get the (promotional) Stand-Alone CD... or the CD/DVD &/or CD/VHS box sets.PS:(all ""10,000 Days"" Vinyls are bootlegs... as are the ""Lateralus"" Blue 1LP & Black 2LP Vinyls -- both *Legitimate* Lateralus LPs were released in ""Picture-Disk"" form)"
5,Happy customer!,The product arrived exactly as described - slight wear and tear on the box but otherwise in perfect condition. very happy and i recommend this seller to everyone:) it made it all the way to australia!
4,Not bad but...,"This set is awesome, yes, but it is limited addition and costs way too much. This is a prime example of why people share files on the internet. $200? No way, download it."
3,Nice Little Snack,"Tool is one of the best bands in the world. How dare they not include live footage in the video. It was very short. The videos are worth seeing . The cd is cool, but its something you can do without, Get it if you absulutely have to, otherwise wait till april for something more fufulling."
3,Good but not great,"I like Tool and all the music they put out, so naturally when I saw the DVD/CD combo set I wanted to get it. It was pricey so I thought about for a while then decided to buy it, thinking there would be live footage, as I have never seen the band live. I was actually quite disappointed when I was done with the DVD. I spent a good half hour trying to find the live footage, and watching the excellent videos, and was a little angry when there was none. The CD with the live tracks was good, but I would have liked another song or two, if not to make up for the lack of ""stuff"" on the DVD. If you're a big Tool fan then you probably won't read any of the bad reviews and pick the new combo up, but if you are a casual listner or aren't into them hardcore you might want to seriously consider it before you shell out the fifty dollars. As an added note, if anyone is reading this and does have the combo, is there any way to get live footage on the DVD, hidden or otherwise?"
5,Tool is awesome!,"Tool focuses on a world full of sheep that follow others because they are told something is cool. Actually listen to their lyrics and maybe it can keep you from writing ignorant comments like you did. Tool is awesome and this CD proves it once again! I love Tool! They are not sell-outs like that idiot wrote, they are against the mainstream. Ever see a Tool video on TRL? Exactly my point. Buy this masterpiece now! And then buy all their other CD's and get ready to get blown away again with their new CD coming out in April!"
5,A must for Tool fans,"The DVD is awesome, and contains their videos for Sober, Prison Sex, Aenema, Stinkfist, and one I've never seen before for their song ""Hush"". The menus for the DVD aren't labeled, but are instead done very artistically, making browsing the DVD an experience in itself. I'm still hunting through it trying to figure out if there are any hidden items on the DVD disc. The CD is excellent as well, with some great live tracks of some favorites, and also contains some new studio tracks at the end: a cover of Led Zeppelin's ""No Quarter"", and another track ""lamc"" which seems to be another ""joke"" track like many found on Aenima, but then breaks into a hidden song at the very end which was a nice surprise. Over all, not much ""new"" music, but still a great Christmas gift for the Tool fan on your list."
5,Solid Product,"The videos on the DVD are top notch. All of the most popular ones from their early work are included here. As for the CD, all of the tracks are at least ""A"" class material, with No Quarter and Part of Me as two of my favorites, and LAMC as my least favorite on the disc. But, the live mix of Pushit is beyond A+. It is, in my opinion, the best track they've ever made. Not much else to say really, it's a nice bundle of material."
2,This is Tool?,"I love Tool. They are a great band. Maynard is a good singer. Adam is a good guitarist, Daney is a good drummer...blah blah blah...This cd is horrible!First, they picked No Quarter, not the greatest Zeppelin song to cover....bad choiceThe rest of these songs seem to be just randomness, like Message To Harry Manback 2, or some of this other new stuff that seems unidentified and hard to get used to.The only reason i even gave this 2 stars is because the c.d. has Pushit which is a really good song, and the DVD has their music videos (which are all amazing), but no live stuff.....don't bother, pick up their 3 other cds, all 5 star work."
4,last track called lame? not so much...,"Just to clarify, the last song is not entitled 'lame'. I do not have my disc in front of me now, so I am unsure if the last 2 pieces are on one track or two. The final portion of the disc is an extremely annoying joke followed by a stripped down acousticish sounding song. The box set as well as Toolband.com labels the song either L.A.M.C or Los Angeles Municipal Court. The neil youngish song is called Maynard's Dick."
3,Salival is not what i expected,"Maybe I just expected to play songs like the original pushit or 46 and 2, but all these songs with the exception of part of me are real twangy. The cover art is awesome and the dvd itself is worth the money it costs. I just didnt think that any song on the album sounded good enough to listen to vice previous ones."
1,Don't waste your time,"The videos are decent, but the live disc is fairly bad. The only good song is No Quarter, but it is still way too... long. Tool is a great band, but I felt like they just threw this collection together without trying."
1,i'm dum as dirt,this cd and dvd is good for fan who like to rock. tools makeing there best rock in years. i bang my head to tools awsome rock. go out and git this cd and dvd. do not bye the vhs becase vhs bites and dvd is like a cd but only its on the tellevision!! and you beter bye an extra one to keep in its pakage becase you can sell it on ebay for like a million dollars somday. tool good...what more are you wating for???
1,"Music for pseudo-intellects in ""joyful-misery.""","I had heard TOOL in the past, and although I thought they had talented-musicans, they were an awful-band for people living-in-misery and wanting to think they have ""hidden-genius"" and are ""deep-thinkers""; thus, they listen to TOOL. On this release, the singer whines & moans more than ever, which should please most TOOL fans. This is a band for unhappy, twisted-people who like to feel empathy from other outcasts. If you don't like to ENJOY misery, stay away from TOOL! The lead-singer(""Maynard"") has a very ""angry-femme"" voice and takes himself VERY-SERIOUSLY; by far the least-talented member of the band. The drummer really IS the band, and you can hear his talent; it is just too bad he didn't use it in a band that wasn't made for isolated-freaks. The Led Zeppelin cover(""No Quarter"") is a DISCRACE to a beautiful piece-of-music, and anyone who thinks it is even close to the magnificent-original is...well..A WEIRDO TOOL FAN!"
1,Oh Bother,"Nice to see that Tool is just as boring live as they are in the studio; if not more so! the carefully created, studio concocted atmosphere of dark depression that is the most appealing aspect of Tool's albums disappears in the live arena, leaving only a boring collection of two chord riffs and awful guitar solo's drenched in feedback and effects to mask their ineffectiveness. Oh Maynard... ""think for yourself"" huh? Hehehehehe! Yeah studio outtakes, wonderful. Another awful release from one of histories worst bands. Oh and their drummer is still one of the most amazing drummers around; pity he's in this band! Go listen to Rush, Maynard!"
5,Salival is an understatement.,"Tool fans salivated with anticipation of the release of this magnificent work. The were not disappointed at its release. Tool sounds just as good live as they do on studio recordings and sometimes even better. I cannot listen to this album without having to close my eyes thousands of times just to absorb the pure emotion and meaning of this collection of songs. I recommend this album to everyone, but then again I recommend any Tool album to anyone. Get their Opiate (EP), Undertow, nema, Salival (good luck finding one), and Lateralus. You will not regret it."
2,"Too much, For too little","I would consider myself a pretty big Tool fan, I own all there albums and I've seen them live in concert and I must say they are one of the best bands in the world. Thinking that because Salival is no longer sold that I should jump at the chance to get my hands on it, but I was wrong. The CD includes 8 tracks that I personally do not find worth the price, and the DVD has 5 videos, witch I will say I enjoyed, but it is just not worth the price, you pay so much and get so little."
4,Laura's Review,"I was required to read this book for a college course, and am glad I was! Although this book was graphic and at times difficult to read emotionally, it conveys a powerful message, with data to back it up. Even if you are unsure of the statistical lingo, the authors do a wonderful job of clarifying and explaining the results of their study. This book is an excellent example of how severe the effects of animal cruelty can be and that changes in society are desperately needed."
5,"If You're Looking for a New Home, Read This book!","If you have any questions or doubts about buying a manufactured home, buy this book! I thought I had done exhaustive research (well, I had!) on manufactured housing, but this book is an excellent and necessary tool to use during the process. During a meeting with a dealer, I used the Guide as a reference and the dealer finally asked me if he could see it. He flipped through a few pages and then wrote down the author's name and the title and asked me where I bought it! After reading the Guide, I visited two dealers in New Mexico that I originally passed by and I am seriously considering the product of one. And, trust me, I am so well informed now by reading and studying this Guide and it's companion book, The Complete Buyer's Guide to Manufactured Homes and Land, that no dealer will ever think I'm a dumb broad they can take advantage of! Thank you, John, for writing these books."
5,Good source to compare MH manufacturers,"Excellent book for comparing different brands/manufactureres of New Mobile Homes. I've found it very useful while searching for a used home to buy. I would like to see something like this for older models and obsolete brands but this one goes a long way. I now know which manufacturers sell in my state, What their typical prices are, How well they are constructed on a scale of 1 to 10. It does not break the value down to specific models but there is a chart i can compare with what ever home I'm looking at to see how it compares with the others.If I had found this book at the library I would go out and buy my own copy."
4,Decent album from legendary stock,"Tyka Nelson (born in 1960) is the all-but-unknown sister of one of the 20th century's most legendary performers, Prince. ""Try My Passion"" is a pretty good song that is a little cheesy lyrically but upbeat and melodic, and the rest of the album has solid, if unexceptional musicianship and production. I'm surprised that just having Prince for a brother didn't lead to much bigger things."
1,Herbie Fully Loaded......with crap that is.,"Oh Michael Keaton, why stoop so low, your much better then this. I can understand Lyndsay, she is a carbon copy, mass produced wanna be actress and singer. No different then Jessica Simpson, Hillary Duhh, or Spitney Spears. I would rather have all my teeth yanked with a pliars, or run through a field of nettles naked then view this crap again. Michael Keaton, fire your agent. Look for Clint Howard making out with a bulldog in the background."
1,a movie intended for pre-teen Lohan fans,"I'm a 20-something yr old Lindsay fan and I have liked all her previous films (The Parent Trap, Mean Girls being the best, in my opinion). Although Lohan, Keaton, etc. all have great delivery of lines, this is nothing more than a kiddie movie. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone even in the pre-teen age-range because I didn't find this movie one bit funny. It only implies that you need to use violence and cheating to solve situation (for example: Herbie flying over other cars to win the race, or Herbie beating up the antagonist).If you have small kids that want to see this movie, it would be wise to warn them that it may be a bit scary - there's a monster truck ralley scene where Herbie is shown being beaten up, and even I was a little freaked out by that.The majority of music in the film is good. It's too bad Lindsay's song ""First"" wasen't on until the credits, that's one of the best songs in the film."
2,Boring and Plotless!!,"I thought this movie might be good and was I ever wrong! Boring and no plot describe this movie and I expected better from Lindsay Lohan. This was totally predictable and lame!!! Also Lindsay said ""Oh my God"" like 5 times in the first 5 minutes. I felt like saying ""shut-up!"""
2,Unfunny slapstick that is good for kids or serious Herbie fans,"This movie really was quite lame in its attempt to be funny. I understand that it's a Disney movie and are supposed to be aimed for kids and families, but the jokes and acting were played a little too seriously.I feel bad for Matt Damon. He does a sensational job in Crash. I mean he really came out of his shell, but in this he just played this ""bad guy"" rival champion racer that was just to farfetched. I found myself saying, ""Oh, gimmie a break!"" in my head throughout the film.Lindsay Lohan is quite the attractive girl in this, which is the only reason I didn't give it a 1. She was very good in Mean Girls, but she had to go back to her Disney roots, which she seems to be getting a little too old for.Good movie for kids and families, but if you hate Disney, cheesy humor...Stay Away!!!"
2,NOT totally innocent...,"I'm a parent of small children and I was kind of shocked with this ""G"" rated movie. Lindsay Lohan says ""OH MY G.."" about 5 times in a 5 minute segment. She says it close to 10 times in the total movie. For me, that is an offensive phrase and not one that I want my kids to hear and repeat. Also, when the guy is trying to sneak a peek at Lohan undressing in the backseat of Herbie, and when they ""accidently"" fall on each other in Herbie's backseat.Don't get me wrong...There are far worse things that a movie could have, but should this be rated G? I don't think so.This is beside the fact that the movie is completely dumb and predictable. One reviewer here said:""Herbie Fully Loaded doesn't fall pray to the typical family movie cliche"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? This is totally cliché. I mean, are we surprised that Maggie wins the final race? Duh.Lohan has ruined yet another Disney classic. First ""The Parent Trap"" and now the ""Herbie"" movies. Please, Lindsay. NO MORE!"
4,Herbie:Fully Unloaded rocks!,"It was Awsome. Well, I kind of had low expectaions for it, but it was really cute and entertaining for a rated G movie.It brought back wonderful memories of the originial movies, and Herbie brought those old tricks with him. I think the kids enjoyed it, but also I heard adults laughing (as well as my friend and I). I think the people who have seen the originial (and liked them) will like this movie. Disney does a really great job.I give this 4 out of 5. :)P.S Adults really loved this movie too. I'm 22 and I know I did. I personally think you had had to see the orginials to appreciate this movie."
3,"""Herbie"" Isn't A Winner This Time...","I was almost dissapointed when I watched this film because it lacked, how do you say, ""spunk"". Just the film itself was almost boring to me. Don't get me wrong, I love Lindsay Lohan & Herbie but it just wasn't one of those movies you'll love. Kids that are 7 and younger will love it, but if you aren't 7 or younger, you'll probably feel the same as me. These upcoming holidays, don't get this film, get ""The Perfect Man"" instead; it'll be a much better buy. Also, the special features on this disc were dissapointing aswell. Almost nothing with Lindsay Lohan except her music video, ""First"". Like I've said before, this isn't worth the money. I guess Herbie isn't a winner this time..."
1,Herbie full of it.,Well the originals were amazing. This one was full of graphics and the originals never had all those stupid human like antics on the car. To me it could have been a lot better especially without all the dumb car antics but that is just me.
5,Good buy,"I remember seeing the original Herbie movies when I was a kid. This new movie was upbeat and lived up to the reputation set by the originals. Myself being a stree racer, I think it was interesting what they did to the style of the car."
4,If u like disney show style. u will like this one,"Accually i like disnay show all the time, so for ME , this a nice one"
5,A Very Funny Movie,I bought this movie for my family cause me and my husband are both Herbie fans. We watched it and we both thought it was very funny. Of course it is a little unrealistic but that is the fun of Herbie. My 4 year old daughter also thought it was very funny. I would recommend this a very great family movie and for the people who are young at heart.
4,Wonderfully Cheesy,"Herbie Fully Loaded is one of those movies that is just fun to watch. Even though I did not consider myself a Herbie fan before seeing this movie, I definitely was a fan after leaving the theater.Herbie Fully Loaded is a nostalgic, wonderfully cheesy trip down memory lane. The director Angela Robinson unabashedly embraced this project that could easily have been overdone. Robinson's shameless use of montages (there are at least four) and her inclusion of the same slapstick gags that seem to have sprung right out of the original movie make Herbie Fully Loaded a delight to watch.If you give this movie a chance it is guaranteed to work its way into your heart and probably into your video collection."
3,A good fun family film that should please old and new Herbie Fans,When Herbie Fully Loaded came out in June it did so so in the box office and I think it's becouse of bad marketing. The trailer for the flm looked bad but the surprise is the film is pretty good. Yes this film is a family film so there is lots of corney moments and it's predictable but it's fun. The movie has funny moments and it makes you cheer. The downfall is I found the movie to drag on at times and be too corney for some young adults. Overall the film is a fun family film.
4,Go Herbie!,"Lindsay Lohan fans, beware! If you are looking for a film in a ""Mean Girls"" style, don't go for it. However, if you like Disney's well-known manner of creating family-friendly films, you've got the right title.""Herbie: Fully Loaded"" is a remake of the popular film serial from the '70s about Herbie, a fast VW Beetle with a mind (and attitude!) of its own. However, in the 21st century, he's at the junk yard, too old-fashioned to be driven. There he sees Maggie (Lindsay Lohan), an ex-street racer, who is looking for a cheap vehicle to buy. She buys Herbie, and when she finds out about their common interest, the fun begins!This film is a candy for kids and adults alike. It's not as sterile as ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" (another Lindsay Lohan-Disney collaboration, and not a very succesful one), but it's not nearly as sassy as ""Mean Girls"", either! It's a movie about friendship, love... and how a VW beetle can be a regular Cinderella!"
4,Herbie Loves Lindsay,"""Herbie Fully Loaded"" has Herbie returning with Lindsay Lohan as his driver, a college graduate known as ""Mags"" looking to make a bit of money to pay the rent by way of the races. It was fairly good for the most part, lot of practical effects, and when there was computer animation it was minimal and tasteful. Went on a bit toward the end, but it was fine. Funny moments. Three and a half stars."
4,Cute,"Real Herbie lover, new modern twist. Fun to see changes they made to the car. Must watch understanding not the same as the old ones."
2,Who is this for?,"Basically a ""best of"" from three albums Hunter did for Chrysalis, I really don't understand what purpose this CD serves. If you're a Hunter fan, you are going to get the originals, Particularly SCHIZOPHRENIC and the great live recording WELCOME TO THE CLUB. Both are vital recordings for anybody who wants to get to the essence of Ian Hunter. I'm going to give it two stars for the fact that the songs are good and if you have no clue who Hunter is, it could serve as a sampler, but for you Hunter fans out there avoid this one. It will add nothing new."
5,A business mans dream,I travel alot and the this product makes me look forward to trips. I eliminated the remote FM interference problem by removing my radio's antenna. I have not listened to a commercial in a year. The product has performed perfectly and the remote compensated for the flat buttons on the unit. This product was very easy to install and the antenna stuck to the dashboard has worked very well. My sanity is worth alot to me and this product is worth the money.
2,great except for one big little thing,"A great system except for one thing, a very high frequency is emmitted from the reciever which I find extremly enoying. However, other people do not seem to hear it."
2,it's shimmer,I am african american and bought sally hansen airbrush legs shimmer because of a previous review from another african american girl who loved the apperance of the spray. I first applied the spray as the instructions says which was to spray it on your hands and rub it in so when i sprayed it on my hands the spray was really cold and seem to stick to my hand and when I glided the spray on my legs I hardly seen a difference I could see the shimmer but did not see the airbrush effect like the models legs on the can. I liked the product because of the shimmer effect but it wasnt really what I would have expected. If someone is looking for an airbrush effect this probably wouldnt be something you should get (for african americans)but if you like goldent tint of shimmer this would be perfect.
1,Chemical smell - not good,Doesn't do anything. Slight sheen but wears off. Tried to use in a fashion show for the models and nothing happened on any of the models. Almost like both bottles were just filled with air. Not worth it.
1,First words that come to mind.. Bland & Boring!!,The narration in this pack is the worst I have EVER heard.. Its so bland and boring its so hard to get into and pay any attention to.. I was most certainly disapointed with this purchase and wouldnt reccomend it to anyone.
4,Only one complaint,"that is the comentary intro is the same for every episode, which are maybe 4 per DVD, and it is an intro lasting several mintues, ie. Caince killed Able, Chronus sleuth, blah blah blah."
1,no photos! no photos! no photos!,"For a book which is to remind us all of our innocent days of eating Cap'n Crunch in front of the TV set on Saturday morning for hours, this thing is lousy. The text is an easy enough read, intelligent with some valid points. But the photographs (the very few in here) are awful. Didn't the authors and the publisher understand that this type of book demands nostalgic images from the past to help the book along? What were they thinking?--obviously not of book sales."
3,"Uneven, but a trip down memory lane...","I just finished the book, and I wanted to echo what several others have said here. The Burkes do their best work when recalling the shows, in the chapter called ""The Shows Themselves."" Their riffing on Scooby Doo and the rest made me laugh out loud. Where things seem to fall apart is in the completely unfunny sidebars, and the pseudo-sober history lesson at the beginning."
2,Only fair...,"This book was only fair at best. It had only a few pictures (mostly of board games and toys) and little worthwhile information. It's basically a collection of the authors' opinions, thoughts, and memories on the topic, which meant little to me since I value my own opinions and memories much more. It's almost like the authors didn't seek, want, and/or have permission to write this book from the people who created the shows they discuss. The authors give us their thoughts instead of the thoughts of the thoughts of those who really matter... the people who created or were involved with the shows. I was hoping for a trip down memory lane; this book took a detour very early on and never got back on track."
5,Excellant quality,This was a Christmas present for my daughter at her request. It arrived on time and was exactly as described. You can't go wrong with a Kershaw! She loved it!
5,Kershaw Ken Onion Rainbow Leek Folding Knife with Speed Safe,"I've had a Rainbow Scallion knife for years and have loved it. I got that knife originally because it was small and seemed a bit elegant with the rainbow coating on it. Therefore I thought it wouldn't freak people out at work when I took it out to open a box of copy paper for example. Fast forward 9 years and I wanted something bigger to carry outside of work. I liked the shape and size of the the Leek. I decided to order the Rainbow coating after coming to appreciate how unique it is after using my Scallion all these years. I'm very happy with the rainbow Leek. Kershaw makes a high quality knife. The coating will show normal scratches and signs of wear if kept in a pocket with keys for example. However, if you take care of the knife, it will last forever despite a little wear and tear."
5,THE BEST KNIFE IN THE WOLE WORLD!!!,the kershaw leek knife is the nicest knife i have ever owned in my life! I have about 20 knifes and it is by far the best in my collection. and to top that it is S.A (spring assisted) which means it has a mighty quick one hand opening! very nice
5,Secret History,"This book was well researched and written. Tattoo's have mostly been associated with men, bikers and sailers, but this book has aptly described and displayed what a lot of people would not openly admit wanting to see."
1,old book,This book seems so outdated. The intentions of this book are great but there is still plenty more great information about tattoos and women out there. This is very much like a college book to me. I hardly bothered reading it and the pics are from the 80's and 90's mainly. The cover is a little misleading too!
2,Patently Clear Bias from the Authors,"The authors of this reference book have a clear ideological bent, and it's expressed in favor of those politicians who combine cultural liberalism or libertarianism with free-market economics; thus, if a Representative or Senator leans rightward culturally or leftward economically, you can expect an editorial evaluation of him or her less favorable than the former sort, whether, it seems, deserved or not of that person."
4,Barone again produces a stellar summary of American politics,"The 2000 Almanac is a clear improvement on the 1998 version with more up-to-date analysis, newer pictures of the elected officials and the Cook analysis of each district.As always, the observations regarding the representatives and senators and their states and districts are outstanding. The insight and understanding of both politics and policy exhibited by Barone is inspiring to all those who are fascinated by the electoral process.The addition of Cook's impression of each district and his handicapping of upcoming races provides some additional insight but is a bit terse in most cases and provides little more than Barone's predictions within member profiles included in previous almanacs.That said, this is clearly an improvement on the 1996 and 1998 versions, which seemed to go overboard in defending the new GOP majority."
2,Bias shows,"As a reader of this series for many years I can certainly appreciate the breadth of information the Almanac provides for each and every state, Congressional district, Senator and Representative. To have all of this contained in one book is quite impressive.Unfortunately I have grown tired of the author's personal opinions filtering into the text. Such bias has grown with each edition to the point that it is virtually impossible not to question the figures the books quotes out of concern that they are merely there to further the author's agenda and personal political viewpoints. This is a shame, as it has ruined a good series."
2,Not Great,"This is not my first facial sauna but it is the worst I've used. The ""Cold"" function does not work well (not significantly enough at least) but the hot function works fine. It tends to leak the water you put in, even if you keep it below the max-fill line."
3,Disappointed,Good point:The cold mist is nice and relaxing. Have a timer.Not so good point:1)Hot sauna: insufficient steam (have to cover my head with towel to collect more steam)2)Cold mist: supposed to emit mist but sometimes it sprays tiny bit of water instead. Not a big issue.3)Need to use distill water.
1,Beware: Product Rarely Works: Not Worth the Hassle,"I received one of these for Christmas. The product would not produce any hot steam. In fact, the light for ""hot"" did not come one. I sent it back -- paying $15 in postage -- and received a 2nd steamer. This one heated, but it took 30 minutes and no steam came out. Also, the facial piece was broken. So I'm now in the the dilemma of deciding whether to spend yet another $15 to replace THIS one. If the 3rd one doesn't work, then I'm out $30 -- so far. This is not worth it. I don't have the heart to tell the teen-ager who gave it to me that it's a worthless product and that she wasted over $45 on what will soon be trash. Such a waste. Such a sham."
1,Does not work,"This product does not work. It takes over 20 minutes to heat up, then does not produce enough steam to be worth the effort. I even made a tent over it and didn't get the sauna effect. This product is a complete waste of money."
1,Rip off!,"This DVD is very misleading.While the short yoga sequence is great, the ""guided"" portion is obvious advice (""planning ahead can reduce stress"") given overvoice while pretty pictures of waterfalls, etc, are shown. There is nothing guided about it.Personally, if I want facts, I'll get a book, so the nutrition part was a non-starter.The idea of a guided relaxation sequenced should be talking you through how to relax at that moment. This does not do that at all."
2,taw,"Needed a dvd that is soothing and relaxing, it talks about letting go from your stressful day, ect. Just music and scenery would be nice and positive breathing and techniques to relax, does not do this."
2,description,"In this companion video to GUIDED RELAXATION FOR SLEEP, Dr. James Rouse is back to provide a new series of techniques that will help to reduce stress. Also included are the segments ""Foods for Stress"" and ""Stress-Balancing Meal Plan,"" which introduce to viewers the foods that best help the body to manage stress."
4,Tank porta-pak deodrizer,Great for the camper. had used another brand before thought I would try this mostly because of money cost savings.
3,Not used yet. Will update my review next summer of 2013,"I bought this for my new traveling trailer. I haven't used it yet. Still using the packs included with the trailer. I intent to review it after use. So, this is a placeholder. Will update my review next summer of 2013"
3,Gorgeous case.,"It's beautiful, well made and very very sturdy. There are shelves and racks for everything. You just pull them out, install the components, and slide them back in.My only problem is the noise. Despite what you hear, back and forth, about the fans in the back being ""silent,"" they simply aren't. I have them setup properly, managed by the mobo, and they get very loud after the machine runs for a few minutes. If Thermaltake had build these with enough room for a full-sized silent fan 120mm, then this item would be a ten. As it is, I built this machine for a musician who needs it to be silent for recording, and I find that I regret believing the reviews I read, with the responses always coming back that the user posting is wrong and that the fans are truly silent. They aren't, and I've never seen a 90mm fan that is."
3,"Great box to make a ""PC Console""","Used this box to build a mid range gaming pc to connect to my big screen TV. Getting everything inside was a challenge, only because of the complex layout that makes this box compact. Believe me once you get everything installed, you will NOT want to look forward to making any upgrades (like updating the video card). However, there are two fans and there seems to be adequate cooling so once you have your build it should be very reliable like any other ATX case, as long as you keep your components mid range (a hot runnning overclocked CPU and a hot top end video card might be too much for this box, even if it fits).If I were to build another console PC or HTPC, I would actually go with a small ATX case this time simply because of the high inconvenience of installing/upgrading on small boxes as these."
2,Save your money,"This case is laid out terribly.The mounting holes for the main board don't line up with the with my gigabyte M'board. This leaves an entire side unsupported.There are nice engineering features totally shot in the foot by horrible screw placements, loud fans, and about 3times as many screws as a ""cheap"" midtower case. Plus, the damn blue flashlight used for the power LED. What's with the 10,000 cooling holes that don't line up with any case fan known to man.The case in neither portable, nor small, nor lightweight. There have to be other cases out there that would work out 10x better.This is the last time I waste more than $30 on a case. Just not worth any amount of money.Does it work? Yes. Would I buy it again? Absolutely not!"
3,Just OK,"First off, I love Bill Kirchen. This CD though disapointed. When I want Krichen, I want Telecaster. Some of these songs sound like Jackson Brown. Hammer is the best song for sure, it's almost worth the price by its self. But IMHO, there are three other decent songs and the rest are fast forward. Sorry Bill."
2,Gaba,"Gaba is supposed to have a relaxing effect, and this product did make me tired, but, also there was restless leg syndrome, and restless body syndrome to go along with it, so I was tired, yet, could not sleep because of the terrible feeling in my body!I use have been using Gaba for about 6 months and have had luck with Gnc's brand, and Now's brand.I would not recommend this product, although it did make me tired, the side effects were not pleasant."
3,Book of love,This was a strange movie the kind you may have to watch 2 or 3 times to get the hang of it. but I love Simon Baker and this is just one of many of his movies I have
3,"Good performances, hard to believe","The performances are quite good in this film but overall the premise is hard to accept. A couple befriends a teenage boy, he sleeps with the wife, and the husband does not immediately kick her out or try to strangle him. They continue to hang out, and.....Well, you can take a look for yourself. I just don't find it all that plausible."
2,save your money - spend it on the film: SOMETHING NEW.,"I really like Simon Baker. That's the only reason I bought this film. Sad to say, I threw it in the garbage after watching it. It had no redeeming value and I felt sorry for Simon for contributing his skill as an artist to this schlock. Just my opinion but I didn't even want to recycle this by giving it away."
5,A sad but compelling love story,"This is a rather heart breaking love story about a married woman, age 28, having sex with a 15-year-old dorky kid. It devastates her husband, who is a great guy by any standard. The marriage falls apart and the three go their separate ways. Simon Baker is the husband and no one does heartbreak angst like he does. Just about tears your heart out. He is the only one I had sympathy for. The kid was just a dumb 15-year-old, so you can't expect much judgment from him. The wife was, in my opinion, despicable. All she could worry about was whether her husband still loved her. Not a hint of being sorry for the hurt she caused him. In the end she was the only one who seemed quite happy with how it turned out. Frankly, her husband was well rid of her, although he didn't realize it at the time."
3,Interesting,"The first time I watched it, I didn't get this movie. How could a grown woman, who is supposedly happily married to a man who obviously loves her, allow herself to be seduced by a 15-year-old?As the movie progressed, I asked myself why her husband just accepted her indiscretion and why he wouldn't allow his anger to show. It all comes out in the end, just like in life.This was a profound story if you look deeply at what's going on. Especially for David."
2,Bellydance?,"Featuring a fitness professionsal, who is billed as an experienced dancer, I was very disappointed in the instruction on this DVD. I will give it kudos for being complete in having a warm-up, workout, and cool-down, but I was completely lost during the 'advanced' section since it didn't include any instruction."
3,Praise The Lord With Rev. Timothy Wright,"The album is awesome. This is one of Rev. Wright's best albums. Stand-out songs include ""Stand Up"", ""Jesus (Call On His Name"" and ""Just Believe"". This album is great for church and community choirs. The album is well-worth buying."
4,Sings like an angel,"Michelle Tumes: a little bit of heaven here on earth. I love her soft ethereal voice; it is calming and offers a nice prelude to mediation and prayer.The title song, and, ""I'm With the Angels"" are two of my favorites. Many of her tunes sound similar, but this does not take away from the enjoyment of the cd; this is just her style and what she does best. This cd compares slightly less favorably with her last cd, ""Listen.""If you want mellow, uplifting music that is Christ-centered, ""Center of My Universe is for you."
1,Stop making boring Cd's,"PLEASE STOP MAKING CD'S ABOUT YOUR RELIGION.IT'S BORING,AND MAKES NO SENSE.PLEASE STOP! if you want something real go buy some gangsta rap cd's like,NWA,DR DRE,and ice cube.PLEASE!"
4,"More beautiful music -- but falls short of ""Listen""","Tumes debut, ""Listen,"" was an absolute stunner--gorgeous melodies, beautiful, richly layered vocals, deep, satisfying lyrics. It never completely caught on, but it deemed her, in my opinion, the music world's best kept secret. ""Center of My Universe,"" a very good disc in its own right, has bit more of a pop sensibility -- best tunes include the haunting ""Chant,"" the boppy ""Heaven's Heart,"" and the sad but lovely ""Missing You."" Still, the disc has ten songs and at least three aren't as powerful as the work that characterized ""Listen,"" including the slightly cliched closing track ""I Wish for Peace"" and the extremely lightweight ""Do Ya,"" which reminds me of work by Debi Gibson in the late 80's. I can't quite give it five stars -4 and a half would be about right. Still, I recommend it to fans of Listen and anyone who can appreciate beautiful music."
5,IF I COULD GIVE A MILLION STARS I WOULD!,"As soon as I heard Michelle had a new album out, I bought it right away without having to hear a song on it. I adore her first album and knew she would only get better with time, and she has. It is amazing to me how she has topped ""Listen,"" but wow, she sure has! This music is for everyone; people of all faiths. I am not a Christian but I find such depth and meaning in her music, and the sheer beauty and spirit of it are beyond compare. BUY THIS ALBUM; I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"
3,"I'll wait her next album, but probably won't but her first .","I was a little surprised to find so many 'five star review'. Yes, I like some of her songs ('Deep Love', 'Lovely','Immortal','Missing You'. 'Chant' holds potential, but not enough creativity), and I agree she is really talented singer-songwriter (and producer). But I believe her talent is not in full bloom. I feel she depend her musical attraction on rather sound creating. I'll wait her lyrics in next album will be more contemporary (positive to face this complicated dark real world with deeper sorrow, not only with hope. Don't ""get so weak."" Please make me strong.) But generally, I like this album. I'll buy next. I hope many will listen to her message."
4,Relaxing & Sweet,"Somes friends of mine had purchased her first cd, which sounded good. Then I had heard of her new release, so I FINALLY bought it. Now I'm hooked to it. Not only is it chrisitan, but it's relaxing but also you can sing with it. If you've heard of ENYA...she's just like it in a way. If you like soft music or music that lifts your spirits, then add this to your collection!"
5,You Just Have to Believe in Great Music,"I heard this CD before I knew that Michelle Tumes is a ""Christian"" artist. I was well into the album before I realized she was singing about ""Him"" and not just ""him."" By that time, I didn't care. (I'm Jewish.) Every song on this CD is beautiful, with multi-layered harmonies and rich arrangements. The music ranges from pop that could easily be on mainstream radio (hey, Sixpence None the Richer is a ""Christian"" group) to an Enya-like sound, but it is all very beautiful. Give Tumes a try...regardless of your beliefs."
5,Worthwhile addition,Makes cleaning the underlying main filter much easier and less frequent. Great for keeping large objects such as bugs out of the mesh of the main filter.
1,Poor editing,"Positives,I like the layout and feel of the book. The condensed format is really good. Good to get practice and working quickly in a subject that usually peresented in an overcomplex fashion.Negatives:I have no idea how this book passed any QA. I have found many errors in the equations and in the examples. A simple example of this is page 25 figure 2.7 the lines on the graph are mis labelled they need to be swapped.The line for the top of the constraint is labelled 20x + 8y >= 680 and should be labelled x + 2/5y <= 40The line of the bottom of the contraint is labelles x + 2/5 <= 40 and should be labelled 20x + 8y >= 680If your math is weak or you have limited confidence to challenge the author you will have difficulty in understanding how the examples work.Shame.... Luckly I bought the book second hand. It certainly is not worth the full retail price..."
4,Nice devotional type reading,"This is a wonderfully, simply written book on prayer that anybody can understand. Though perhaps an example or two is a bit dated, as it has been nearly 100 yrs since this book was written, so the author uses some examples that most people probably will not quite understand. There is much light that Chadwick gives on prayer, and I enjoyed what he had to say. However, I do feel there are stronger books on prayer by E.M. Bounds and Leonard Ravenhill that might take one deeper than this book does. Still though, one should not pass this book up."
2,Dull film by Rohmer,"This Franco-German coproduction is the weakest of Rohmer's historical movies (a group of films that includes such accomplished works as The Lady and the Duke, Perceval, and Triple Agent), perhaps because its subject matter seems hopelessly dated. Based on a novel by Heinrich von Kleist and set during the Napoleonic wars, it tells the tale of a young marquise rescued during an assault to her estate by a mysterious count (a young Bruno Ganz). Unfortunately, from that brief encounter the marquise gets pregnant, a huge problem during that time and on account of her position in society. Aside from a dated central conflict, the film is also dull and static, without the redeeming dialogue and interaction between the actors that one sees in other Rohmer films. The director, by the way, plays an amusing cameo as a French general."
1,Much Cheaper if bought from the manufacturer...,You can get the special edition of this DVD directly from the Matchstick Productions website (skimovie dot com) for fifteen dollars.
2,where's the color?,"A bit of a major disappointment for a book with good B/W illustrations, this is a book about one of the great colorist painters of landscape art. Disheartened."
4,Great concert,"Great entertainment video, however, I felt like there was something missing, as if the concert had been editted and some of the concert was missing.On a band note - an extra 1/2 hour with more personnel jamming would have have made it 5 stars."
4,Major source of Asian American panethnic information,"Yen Le Espiritu's book is probably the major source of research and theory dealing with Asian American panethnicity. While there are a few other researchers doing panethnicity work with other ethnic groups, this book remains the main source for those studying Asian Americans.Her summaries of theories of ethnicity are very short and perhaps leave out a little too much. But, the book does a good job of giving the reader an introduction to some major theories in preparation for her ideas. Her main areas are politics, funding, census classifications and anti-Asian violence.I appreciate this book a great deal in that it brings together some disparate pieces of information and puts it all in the context of panethnicity."
2,Not what I hoped for,I was hoping for a book that was much more detailed about the value of a whole bunch of different pieces of Red Wings. This book didn't cut it.
3,Not worth the commitment of this huge bottle...,"I reviewed the liter-sized shampoo also... This is a good conditioner but it never did anything, color-wise. I bought the pair in this liter size, used 1/4, put them under the sink, busted them out again, and am now 1/2-way through, and am still not that impressed..."
4,For every home library!,"I'm not sure that I would call this tome exhaustive, but it comes pretty close! This simple to use, well laid out book is just full of common legal questions and the answers to them. In addition, the language is common English, not Legalise!It won't take the place of hiring an attorney, but it might help you decide if you need one. I think every home would really benefit from having this book on the shelf."
3,Good basic advice,This is a good book for general advice on how to deal with everyday problems. Great bathroom reading!
1,more for yoga practitioners rather than practicers,"I am highly disappointed with this DVD by Shiva Rea. I have several of her other yoga DVDs (prenatal yoga being my first and favorite), but this is my least favorite by far. It takes place at a yoga connference, and (I should have known) it is taught as if you were a yoga instructor looking for pointers for your own class. It's just not at all relaxing, and a bit difficult to follow at times. Most importantly, it goes way too slow! She has us doing the same exact motion over and over for about 5-10 minutes while she explains some yoga concept and it's just plain boring! I wish I hadn't bought this as I don't plan on using it again."
4,Yoga Bear!,"Shiva is one of the best in Yoga, no doubt! It's filmed lived at a conference and it looks good, very clean shoot. you can't go wrong with this program. I tried it and I really feel the benefits. It also has some special features; an indepth interview with Shiva, herself. Good stuff!"
5,A Absolute *MUST* for Educators Designing Online Courses,"Rena Palloff and Keith Pratt have developed the Bible of online course development! Their steps for buidling online communities dovetails beautifully with Vygotsykian learning theory. They provide descriptive examples of interactiions that have occured in courses they have taught, and give realistic cautions for those of us interested in developing our own online courses.Too many people ""slap-dash"" online projects and courses just to say ""I'm doing it."" in order to fulfill institutional requirements. Using _Building Learning Communities in Cyberspace.._, educators can carefully consider the steps and processes that they will need to include within their own courses online."
2,Paloff and Paloff,Are plain boring. . .about all I can say. Much of their theories are dated - I'm sure there's a newer text on online teaching!
5,The Best Primer I've Read So Far,"Palloff and Pratt do an exemplary job at presenting the theoretical as well as practical aspects of building an online learning community. Using the constructivist approach as a foundation, the authors discuss step-by-step how to create an online environment that supports collaboration, dialogue, reflection, and transformational learning. The examples of student and facilitator coversations as well as sample syllibi helped me to visualize the concepts that were presented. Thanks to this book, I have a much better understanding of where to begin. I recommend this book for anyone involved in online learning, especially facilitators, instructional designers, administrators, and learners!"
2,Rambling academic report,"I find this book quite disappointing. Bought it based on the very positive six other reviews on this web site because I was looking for tips on how to do my very urgent e-learning portal project then.The authors ramble a lot on how people in an online community interact with one another. The findings and recommendations were simply not clear or useful in a practical sense.A similar book by Amy Jo Kim called ""Community Building on the Web: Secret Strategies for Successful Online Communities"" was much more useful to me."
5,Interested in VCoPs? Buy this book!,"This book is methodologically sound AND useful. Suggestions and advices are backed up by literature, it's not just the usual collection of ""expert opinions"". By the same token, suggestions and advices are sound and practical, not just impractical ""erudite hypotheses"". Perfect for pracademics!"
5,Whimsical and frequently hilarious,"This is the book on my bedside table that I reach for when I need a tender laugh, a bittersweet glimpse into a real woman's life. Jackie Jernigan's wit is unique, and her imagination transforms ordinary occasions into adventures. Highly recommended!"
2,I beg to differ...,"After reading the favorable reviews above I bought the book. I am now ready to sell it. I read about half of it but by the time I got to the Orions, Sirians, Zetas, Pleiadians...I was over-loaded on all the extraterrestrials that are deluging Earth! I have a high tolerance for mystical things (ask my friends :-) but even I couldn't go along with this fantasy. Gina Lake has a great imagination and should have written this as a novel. Then I would not have had any exceptions to take. But as it is, this is not believable."
1,"terrible, couldn't finish it,bought it because it's signed","This is the only book by Jack Chalker that I could not finish-it was that terrible! Of course, he wrote it with 2 other authors, so maybe THEY were terrible. Every chapter is written by a different one of the three, and it just gets worse and worse, dumber and dumber.Maybe they'll make a movie of it starring Jim Carrey."
2,"Wait for the new edition, if you can.","This CD is clearly a burn of a previously existing cassette. There is little control, from a CD point of view, of focussing in on content the way one might with a cassette player. Further, the English parallels that appear in the companion book are missing. Without the book the usefulness of this CD is limited. In fact, DON'T buy this one by itself. The lack of reference to English meanings will make you crazy. The characterization in the dialogs is very spotty quality. The organization is not very good. If you have the book it will work as a complement, however limited. In the price range, with the book to put things in perspective, it is still a reasonable deal if one needs something right now. Better advice: wait for the 2006 version which one sincerely hopes will overcome the problems with this edition."
4,Delicious but odd,Some of the caperberries are young and like eating a large firm caper but some are more mature and seedy and not as palatable. There's no way of knowing without biting into them.
2,Beware of Scary Dubbing!,"This German horror flick tries its best to frighten in spite of the mediocre plot. Scariest of all is the flat English dubbing throughout this less than ideal film. Unless you can get an original language copy, skip this one altogether."
4,Great Pattern Book.,"I bought a previous copy of this pattern book several years ago. The book was ruined when my spare room was flooded. I was so happy to find this book on Amazon. I have made several of the baskets and cottages for gifts, and everyone just loves them. They are so unique and pretty."
5,Fantastic....,"This is a terrific guide for Michigan U.P hikes. It provides detailed descriptions of each trail, and let's the reader know exactly how far each is. Also includes the ""difficulty"" level of each. Maps are included to show you exactly how to get to each trail. Entire U.P. is covered, from just over the bridge to near Wisconsin. What a great resource!"
1,Beware of this book,"This book has a poor trail rating system... It is based on length of the trail to determine the easy, moderate or difficult. This book would would tell you that climbing a 200' rope straight up is considered easy due to the length. This book put us on a very dangerous trail which it called a moderate- there again based only on length of the trail. If you use the book and find a trail going beyond your skill level turn back !!!!!!! I would research the trails in the book further (internet) before going to hike them.Good luckGod BlessPat Brabbs"
4,Good and Practical,"Didn't refer to the book a whole lot, but what we did try was successful. Information was timely and our experience was better for it."
3,Meh,"Only got it for the Madonna ""Sidewalk Talk"" song. Otherwise there's only one other recognizable song and the rest are pleh."
4,Hey Recruiter,Perhaps you should mention that to get most jobs in the CG you need a combined ar/ve score of 105 on the ASVAB.Study for the test! This book will help
5,Worth every penny!,"This book is worth every penny if you are preparing to take the ASVAB. The full-lenght practice tests were almost identical to what you will see on the real ASVAB. After studying for a few weeks with this book, I scored an 88 (AFQT) and a 124 (GT score). It has been over 10 years since I have taken a math class and this book was an excellent refresher. The real ASVAB almost seemed easier. If you are either needing a refresher or need to learn math and english for the first time, I highly recommend this book. Study...it works!"
4,ASVAB 17th Edition,"The book it's self is a great study tool. For a used book, it's condition was fair, but as far as I'm concerned, it's condition and packaging was not an issue to me (which is why I gave it 4 stars). I was warned that there would be writing up until page 40, but luckily the writing was written very lightly. The shipment was good I got it exactly the day I expected to get it, and the price was giving. Thumbs up"
1,You've got to be kidding.....,I can't see the reason for buying a book on the ASVAB. You only need a 45 for the Army and a 65 for the Navy and Air Force. Anything above that is unnecessary. And if you can't score a 65 on this....then maybe a career in the military isn't for you.
3,I've Seen Better,This multiplication booklet is fair at best. There is a lot of stuff jumbled together on one page and a lot of crossword and unscramble the word puzzles. If you are looking for a way to teach multiplication I would not use this book. If on the other hand you want to give your child a review of skills learned it is ok.
2,It didn't work for me!,"After having spent hours making labels and applying todraws for my craft supplies all the tape popped off within 24 hours.Now to be fair, it was summer and the east coast is humid butI had old tape, 25-30 years old that still clung, just ran out of it.The company I purchased from offered to replace it if I were to send backthe remaining tape but it was more trouble (finding a box, boxing it up,taking to PO, and standing on line) then it was worth.I printed my own labels and used tape."
2,Bland,"This book was a little run of the mill. The story sounded like it would be full of interesting stories about the people trying to escape from East Berlin but they never materialized. The description if his defection / escape is interesting yet the writing makes one have to work to get through the text. We learn of what it was like to live in East Germany and the changes that impressed him the most once he made it ""over the wall"". The book just did not hold my attention for long and I picked it up every now and then finally forcing myself to finish it because I had so much time in it."
4,Escape across the USSR-Turkish border.,"Ushakov was a political theorist in the Soviet Navy and he came under suspicion of writing anti Soviet literature. His ex-wife betrayed him to the Soviet KGB. Once discovered, Ushakov vowed to escape the Soviet Union. He drew up plans to cross into Turkey and devised a timetable to hike through the mountains. This is the exciting part of the book, since he risked both discovery and/or death from the natural elements. This encompassed the first 120 pages. The rest of the book was a discourse in how communism was evil, and anger at his ex-wife. This part of the book is heavy plodding since he goes into philisophy.If anything, read the escape portion of this book. The rest of the book is moralizing about why he defected. He does predict the downfall of the Soviet state and this book was published in 1989. The first 120 pages is a nice read."
4,a family tragedy,"On the whole, we think that this book is quite exciting, because you never know what's happening next. This is a stylistic form that pleases us very much and that's also why we enjoyed reading this novel. The tension increases more and more from the beginning to the end. The plot is very clear and comprehensible, and that's why this book is quite easy to understand. Through the whole novel there is a red line. The dialogues are very interesting and lively, and every spoken word has its importance. So this novel is not very long and this make this story easy to read. The end is quite unexpected and therefore very thrilling."
4,Very nice read,A nice read with a surprise ending which brought the story to a nice conclusion. I would recommend.
4,Good book as a gift,I recieved one and gave one. I heard the author on a San Francisco radio station and he has lived a hell of a life and it is told wonderfully through a fictional tale.
4,Great book...,the ending was super. The whole story was very well done and brought out many wonderful memories for me +++
3,"Solid, but.",Solid brass coupler my only trouble is at retail price its 6$ and dose not have rubber washers with it 0-oleast I got them for 3 a pop and feer shipping :P
4,Palm reading for beginners,"Liked this book a lot, able to understand clearly what the author was trying to share with me. Great!"
2,Primitive,This book vindicated my view that Palmistry and Astrology are forte of Indian astrologers. This book pales in comparison to Indian tomes.
1,Vacuous fluff,"This book bothered me almost from the first word. Half of the text could have been written by a first grader and is nothing more than worthless filler. For example ""People have been fascinated with hands since time began.""Then when it comes to providing usable content there are statements such as ""A pale hand indicates an anemic person."" I wonder how he explains the difference between an office working who lives in Alaska and can't get sun and a native of Miami, FL who is always at the beach. Another similar statement is ""A person with yellowish hands tends to have a jaundiced view of the world."" Both of these statements are impossible to substantiate, and are the most trite attempts at palm reading that I want to vomit."
4,Helpful,"I bought this book for my 16 year old daughter. She flew through the entire book, and found it very interesting and helpful. It was easy for her to understand and it had clear hand illustrations which helped make the meanings clear."
3,it serves it's purpose,"Some good explanations, but I'm not too convinced about the theories. There are too many gray areas and not enough explanations of subtle variations. But I guess it's just for beginners."
4,"Solid EP, but only 14 min...","well I understand this is an EP but I only gave it 4 stars because I feel that some of the 4 songs on here could be longer without being monotonous. so my rating has nothing to do with the quality of music. I mean, if you're into this type of music, longer songs can make an endeavor like this even better. it's not really music you get into, but music that molds around you. however, Sur La Mer presents a unique recording (2 bass, no guitar) that reminds me of Do Make Say Think and somewhat of Tortoise. If you don't like strings (viola, cello) or horns (trumpet) then you probably should not get this. Overall it's a good listen, hopefully they will someday release more sounds."
5,Yoga for both your soul and your body,"This DVD really brings out Seane Corn's best. She leaves you feeling as though you been to a spiritual seminar while going through a nice flow sequence. I feel it is good for beginner as well as intermediate to advanced practitioners. I do have Seane Corn's other Yoga DVD, which I found lacking. In fact I've only watched it two times in four years. So I was very happy to find a DVD that shows you how good of a teacher she really is."
3,not impressed,"1. Seane talks too much.2. It is hard to follow the poses since they stay in one pose for too long, then move through a couple of poses fast. It doesn't have a feeling of ""flow"".3. The room/background is ugly.4. People struggle for space to do poses, and then they start to laugh etc, that is way too distracting for someone who is trying to enjoy the practice.5. Not many different poses, repetitive."
3,Good sequence and intention,"I, like one of the above reviewers, had not experienced a Seane Corn video or class prior to purchasing this one. I was surprised at how different her style is than I'd expected. I found her instruction helpful and the meaning she gives to each movement, each breath, inspiring. However, because I am accustomed to practicing in a very meditative way, I found her style of delivery and tone of voice to be somewhat intense, and therefore, distracting. I suppose I am better suited to a Kripalu-style class and instructor. (I did not, however, have the same reaction to the Baron Baptiste or the Shiva Rae classes in this series. I found their voices and delivery very conducive to my meditative practice, even where poses and sequences got relatively vigorous.) I am sure that my reaction to Ms. Corn's delivery is peculiar to me, and that most people will find her and this video inspiring and helpful."
1,didn't like it,"This is a taped vinyasa taught to other students in a hotel, Seane walks around with a mic...no music and barks at people to tell them whether pose is good or not. I was surprised...not what I expected"
4,Great album,"This is a great album from Anathema. It is a little dissapointment that great solo work here is gone, but there are much new things that can make this album sound awesome. ""Fragile Dreams"" is breakground song.. and it sets the atmosphere for the whole album."
5,Buy or die!,"I've been waiting a long time for this album and now, at last, I might say that all the expectations have been realized. If you have listened to their early records you'll probably have much difficulty to recognize it's the same band, if you don't have listened to them, you'd better do it as soon as possible. Anathema, together with Amorphis, had conceived a new way of playing music and I hope that they'll come back again in Liguria for their inspiration. In conclusion we have ten little gems to bring with us for the entire life."
3,An brief glimpse of Axton in action,"The mini concerts at Church Street Station are a good way to glimpse performers that were around before the days of music videos. The quality is acceptable (not great), the play time is only about 22 minutes, but the price is right which makes these DVD's worth having in your collection. This is a good way to see Hoyt Axton now that he's no longer with us. Axton was a talented guy - actor, singer, and songwriter. Here he performs 4 songs including the song he wrote for ""Three Dog Night""... ""Joy to the World."" Also included is one of his catchiest songs ""Boney Fingers."" The DVD also includes a brief history of country music which is a bit dry, but we watched it and found it informative with some interesting historic footage."
3,Kinda lame,I love old Hoyt but this must have been recorded late in his life. Not much to it. Just ok
4,Mostly great,"This is a really reasonably priced slicing knife. I bought this after reading Cook's Illustrated review. It's comfortable to hold, and does a nice job. I wish the blade were a tad heavier.but for less than $30, I am happy!"
5,Rated 6 Stars,"This is an incredible book, in my opinion head and shoulders above other popular African hunter books. J.A. Hunter was born in Scotland and moved to Africa when he became an adult. ... He subsequently became a professional hunter and guide, and later an animal control officer. He details a Masai lion hunt he took part in - rare stuff - and lion hunting with dogs. Many dangerous episodes are also related about rhino, elephant, and water buffalo. The book is a modestly written, eye witness account. This is a classic, and I'm glad to see it back in print, as it was originally published in 1952."
5,Hunter,This is the best book on African Dangerous Game Hunting that I have read to date. John Hunter (coincidence of name and profession) hunted in Africa (mostly Kenya) in the first half of the 20th century and with his 'cropping' activities for the Kenya Game Department shot staggering numbers of the 'big five'. His unassuming old world style is engaging and I found the book difficult to put down and was disappointed when I reached the end - I was left craving more. That he survived to write his books is testimony to his skill as a hunter.
5,Loved It as a Kid and I Love It Now,"I used to read John A. Hunter books as a kid and I just loved them. I would dream of big game hunting in Africa and would delight in the thrills and dangerous detailed by Hunter in his book. After about 40 years I decided I would like to reread Hunter's books so I ordered the classic HUNTER by John A. Hunter. I find I enjoy the book even more now that I can understand the the wonders of Africa during the first half of the 20th century. The book describes hunting dangerous game in the bush and jungles of Africa. Hunter describes the guns he uses and why. (I still would like to have a double barrell Jeffrey!)If you are enthusiastic about guns, hunting, and a big game paradise that was Africa before WWII, this book is a must!"
5,hold on to this one,"If you like reading about hunting in old Africa, but still of a fairly modern time, this is a great read. I wish I could find my first edition copy as I see it is now worth quite a bit more. One of those loans that never came back and I can't remember who I loaned it to. I consider this a must have in any hunters library. You are reading about a past era, so don't think this is any sort of how-to book. Just a timeless portrait of a man and his fascinating life. I am so glad it was re-published. Enjoy."
2,"Gorgeous, but...","The grandparents bought this durable but expensive trike when our son was 2. Sure it rides and pushes smoothly, is sturdy and can tolerate the elements, BUT there's something drastically wrong with the sizing- especially the distance from the seat to the pedals. He has found it very hard to ride (or even be pushed in) until recently and he's nearly 4. A small child must be able to sit snugly back in the seat and easily reach and push the pedals or he will lose interest-- and confidence-- fast. A friend bought the same trike and concurred there was just something wrong about how her daughter fits on it, though she has no trouble riding the more compact tricycles at school with no assistance. Maybe the manufacturer's mistake is in recommending it for toddlers."
4,So worth the price!!,"I did a TON of research on tricycles before my son's 2nd birthday. After researching and looking at several Radio Flyer and Kettler models, we finally decided on the Jumbo for our son. We like the s-frame, which makes it easier for him to get on and off the seat. It's very easy to adjust and we LOVE the pushbar feature. We're both tall parents, and the handle length is great. My only complaint is that it can be difficult to push in a straight line. The handles lock, but not in a perfect line, so it tends to go to the left or right. I imagine this would happen with any bike, so I'm not that upset about it. I talked to several parents who bought a Radio Flyer, only to turn around and buy a Kettler within a six months. We decided to save the money by benefiting by their experience. We were fortunate to find the trike at a local toystore for the same price and they assembled it for free! Kettler is awesome and I expect this bike to last a really long time. Plus, our son loves it!!"
5,Best broadheads money can buy,They shoot like field points and drop game dead. They also have a lifetime replacement warranty on breakage. Break one send it back home to great bend kansas and they send you a new one. Cant get a better broadhead any were.
5,A powerful reminder of what music is all about...,"Toby Marks has given us an excellent musical journey with his newest album. Although the amazon reviews have been mixed on the musical merits esp. when compared to his previous albums and the lack of consistency, here's my take: the album rocks!! It's a beautiful mix with an underlying theme of all that's being forgotten in our modern existence: farewell ferengistan is an eulogy to the innocence that is rapidly disappearing in the current divisive world. The title track infuses haunting arabic vocals with a slow background that has stayed with me since I first heard it. Other tracks that I have come to really like are Chingiz and Saturn Return.Do yourself a favor and join the journey that is Banco De Gaia..."
2,Farewell Ferengistan,"This CD does nothing for me.The attraction that BDG has for me is its pulsating rhythm which uplifts you and carries you with it as it plays upon the tension of the melody the percussion and the chorus. ""Last Train to Lhasa, BigMen Cry, The Magical sounds of Banco De Gaia"" is the encompassing musical experience for those who like the pulsating almost primitive sounds that ""Banco"" delivers.The strength of Toby Marks is in his background as a drummer. Utilizing Ambient dub with Arabic and Middle Eastern influences he has created some of the most dramatic and exciting music of his genre.""Farewell Ferengistan"", is not one of them.Mbrillson"
2,Hello predictability,2 1/2Warmly exotic but rarely gripping downtempo has a hint of unique positivity but ultimately feels too boxed in to provide said liberation.
3,"A little too ""house"" for me","Whe I first heard Banco de Gaia's ""Last Train to Lhasa,"" I was blown away. I have purchased several other of their CD's and been happy enough, but this one is much heavier on beat than on atmosphere. Thump and bump is all well and good, but it's also a good way to stretch out thin material. In all, passigle, but not my favorite album."
5,Constant surprises,"This is not your father's history of Nazi Germany. Burleigh skips the standard and too many times retold elements of the rise of Nazi Germany and concentrates instead on a corrective explanation of previously unexplored undercurrents that made the Third Reich what it was. Every chapter abounds with discoveries you will not find in any other standard history of the period. Beyond this, Burleigh has a refreshingly energetic writing style and I find myself eager to pick the book up again each day to continue. It's probably not the best choice for a first book on the Third Reich, but I'm sure it will one day be considered one of the greatest."
2,The Third Reich,"Save your money. Yet another book about Jewish victimization. Judging from Mr. Burleigh's previous works, this is his area of interest and speciality. It is by no means a new perspective on 'the Third Reich'. It is surely no advance on Wm. L. Shirer's somewhat dated history written close after the war with the expected overuse of adjectives, and the many histories that have followed. Mr. Burleigh writes as so many contemporary academicians, which is to say with extraordinary resort to notes and bibliography (125 pages) as if to impress with his research, similar to any PhD thesis. In places, the text seems to be a gloss on the numerous paragraphs Mr. Burleigh has inserted from other authors. Why did I buy it then? I was gulled by critical reports in several of the news media. I am seventy and get most of my books via Amazon. Had I been in a store and thumbed through ""The Third Reich"" I would never have bought it. Be happy to donate my copy."
1,Same old rehash....,"Just another rehash of the same old garbage we've been forcefed for years. Just mention the ""poor"" Jews and how they werepersecuted and it'll be published... For the real deal on National Socialist Germany, read ""Nature's Eternal Religion"" sold here on Amazon. Most people rate these Third Reich books almost without thinking because they have been conditioned that way without really knowing the history of the times. Instead, for a couple of bucks you can download ""Nature's Eternal Religion"" and come away much the wiser."
3,"Mixed, not for the weak","Others have summarized the book well enough so I won't do so. I do agree that the book does not really break all that much new ground, but it is organized well, and so that may be different or new to some readers. It is obviously well-researched, and thorough. The problem is that it is far too much of a slog to get through the dense prose. Every sentence requires unpacking, and unless one is already pretty familiar with the subject, too much prior knowledge is required. Not an enjoyable read."
2,Plodding & Difficult to Read,"I agree with ""writing got in the way"". The writing was so difficult to follow it required reading a sentence 2 or 3 times to figure out what he was saying. I finally give up after 90 pages. No comparison to ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" which kept me up for days. A new viewpoint gets you nowhere if you can't finish the book. Wish I had saved my money."
1,Ick!!!,"Let me start by saying I never write reviews. Secondly, I am a product junky and have tried most of the products people rave about. My hair is fine, wavy, not processed, but still rather dry. I have been using biolage, but was ready for a change. Got this b/c of all the amazing reviews. It is honestly one of the worst products I've tried. My hair is like straw. Thought the hair mask would help... and it does a little bit, but no where near what you'd expect for the money. Also got the leave it treatment, thinking it would help. Nope. Bottom line: Save your money.Note: The product did arrive quickly, but I cannot comment on its authenticity."
1,Rip off.,"Real Kerastase Shampoo leaves the hair smooth and manageable. I used this and my hair was like a scouring pad...dry, horrible. I think they fill this great big bottle with bogus shampoo and charge you $68.00. I do not recommend buying this shampoo online...I don't know who the vendor was, but they sold me a fraudulent product.I had to go out and buy a new bottle of Kerastase, which is wonderful. Another $38.00 out of my pocket."
1,Genuine product?,"""Buyer beware"" may apply to some of the Kerastase products here (phenomenal product line, by the way--I've been using on and off for nearly 10 years). Away from home, I was going to buy from this seller (btw, that would be...??) until I noticed that the back image appears to have Chinese or Japanese writing. HUH??? Also, product safety seal missing from opening in another image (hmmm...). More importantly, I discovered that genuine Kerastase products are sold only in authorized salons or via the product line's official website. Given some reviewers also questioned the authenticity of the product, no thanks--at least for this seller (again, is...?)"
3,Ok but the conditioner is awesome,The shampoo is just Okay. The conditioner is what makes this line a winner. Use any cheap shampoo with the conditioner though and you've got great hair.
2,Not worst its money,"Im a great fan of all kerastase hair products and normally almost all of them are awesome. This is just regular, not so intensive, i could definitely get a better kerastase product for this money, not worth it."
5,Super Shampoo,"I wash my hair ever few days and have found this shampoo to be perfect, as it has a subtle scent, you use a lot less than other shampoos, and it leaves my hair silky and shiny.. I feel the Krastase line is of superior quality to any other brand I have used."
5,"Barbi Mod, Ca",I'm so impressed by this product only after using it once my hair felt to soft and silky. I was afraid to spend the money but it's worth every bit and more. I will never try another shampoo again. I'm using the condtioner along with it since I have dry and processed hair.This is just what I have been searching for and now I have a wonderfull product. They need to get it out on the market more . Thank you KERASTASE.
3,bought these for use with combat boots,I bought these socks for my husband to wear with his military boots. They are just barely tall enough to top the boots. But they are the best we've found out there.
3,Nightmare 4: the musik!,"*The title song is by Tuesday Knight, its called 'nightmare' (running from this nightmare). AHHH I can picture the scenes to the scores, cool use of instruments, and the music is done by Craig Safan who did the soundtrack to the wonderful 'Fade to Black'."
3,Tuesday Knight,"If you have Kazaa then you should be able to find ""Nightmare""by Tuesday Knight, i just downloaded it a few days ago"
5,Best score for any horror series,A Nightmare On Elm Street has the best score of any kind of horror series out their in my opinion. Each film never ceased to amaze me with the music. This score is no different. The best tracks on it are the last two (the finale of NOES 4).
3,What is the title of the song with joey and the waterbed,I need help what is the song that is playing when joey gets killed in his waterbed? I love that song but i don't know what the name of it is. Please help
1,name for a song?,when the brother is practicing his martial arts there is a song he's playing and i cant find the name of it. who sings the song?
3,The Ghost Walker was an interesting read.,"The Ghost Walker was quick and easy reading. As a fan of Tony Hillerman's work and his fascinating Navaho characters, Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, I was interested in how Margaret Coel's work, set on the Wind River Arapaho reservation, would compare. Maybe it wasn't fair to compare. Coel's and Hillerman's styles are totally different, as they should be. Even though they both write about Native Americans on the reservation, every writer is unique, every story is different. Coel's Father John O'Malley is certainly an engaging character, a real, flawed human being like the rest of us. Still, I found Coel's story here to be not quite as engaging as I thought it could have been (thus, 3 stars). I enjoyed the book enough, though, to want to read another in the series, maybe The Dream Stalker."
5,Compelling,"As usual Margaret Coel draws you into The Ghost Walker in the first couple of pages. Her descriptions of the scenes, the emotions of the characters, and the weaving of Native American history into the mystery, make for very interesting, ""can't put it down,"" reading."
4,#2 IN WIND RIVER RESERVATION SERIES,"This was one of the earlier books in the Wind River Reservation series. Somehow, I missed reading it years ago when I read the rest of the series. Father John and Vicky Holden are very prominent in the entire series. This time out, the mission is up for sale and there is EVIL afoot. Good story."
3,Enjoyable book but performance not so great,"These audiobooks are called ""Dramatic Readings"" to differentiate them ""narrations"". I like the stories, but I find the reading style very difficult to enjoy. Stephanie Brush sounds like she studied at the William Shatner school. I'll continue to tolerate these performances because I enjoy the mysteries and learning about the Arapaho culture."
2,Disappointing,"After consuming everything Hillerman has written, and learning something new about Native American culture from each book, and after Hillerman's squib on the Dust jacket, my expectations were set so far above what this trite book delivered that even two stars seems kind... As a 1/8 Arapaho [& 1/8 Blackfoot] i had hoped to learn something about their life. The characterizations were also paper thin, including both the male and female protagonists... and the denouement was telegraphed for miles... ergo, even as a mystery/suspense novel, this one flunked."
5,Wonderful photography book,"I've purchased and read many digital photography books and this is by far one of the best. Not only are the photographs ""coffee table quality"" but the book is chalk-full of practical ideas to make it possible for any other photographer to create their own wonderful photographs. Thanks to Mark for the lessons and for sharing his outstanding work!"
1,Fake,"This is not the same quality as the spray from the salon. It is not as sticky and smells like alchol. Do not buy this, it is a fake"
1,Worst Product ever,The adhesive on the protectors was a slimy stringy mess. More like snot than adhesive. Not at all usable.
2,Thanks.,"The cat still gets past them, but hey what can you do she's a cat. They are protective though its best to just cover your whole damn couch or whatever in plastic."
2,Not as expected,We were not happy with this item. It was very difficult to work with and didn't function well at all.
3,for the money,it works ok. the adhesive is not that good and it looks tacky but it stops the cats. i don't think they will last very long.
4,Great Book,"Great book. Cecil has great taste and syle. Her designs are beautiful and inspiring. I really enjoyed this book and after owning it for 2 years, I still read it often, no plans to ever sell my copy, I plan on keeping my book forever, I love it."
4,beautiful bracelet,"I thought this was a very beautiful bracelet, gave it as a gift the recipient was very happy, looks exspensive."
5,Lots of compliments,"24k Gold Genuine Peridot with Genuine Diamond Accent BraceletThis is a beautiful bracelet. I've gotten many compliments on it. The clasp could be a little better, but so far it hasn't fallen off. I would recommend it to anyone with an August birthday.;-)"
4,Beautiful but not right size,The bracelet I received is beautiful but I ordered a size 7 and received a 7.5. I will have to pay to have it sized.
4,Great Ring,This ring was exactly as described in the profile (and picture). It is very elegant for such a great price. I gave this to my girlfriend for her birthday and she loved it. It looks very good on her finger. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted a small gift for their significant other.
5,"Razor sharp, sturdy build","This is by far the best knife I have ever owned or used. Deployment of the blade is lightning fast and reliable, partially due to the reversible belt clip that allows a tip up carry position that I prefer. I have not seen too many other blades with this option which was the final selling point for me. The clip is very rigid and provides a secure hold to my pocket. Handle is contoured perfectly to fit my average sized hands and the rubber grips are a good bonus. Product was shipped fast and was packaged sufficiently. Totally worth the price, going to order the non-serrated version also."
4,A Good Knife,"Nice looking and very sharp. I find that the grip is not as great as described, but sufficient. Speed Safe function is excellent. In case you wondered...this is not a tool for opening envelopes in an office, though I'm certain it could perform the function. A good buy. My first Kershaw knife and after seeing the quality, I've already purchased another."
1,Not Impressive,My children love Star Wars and each wanted different Star Wars toys for Christmas. This toy was inexpensive but very cheap looking. Princess Leia's face is ugly and doesn't look at all like the real character's face. I would suggest buying a different toy.
3,"Tops on features, short on accuracy!","The 510 is a great unit and I plan to keep it even with it's shortfalls. First off it has yet to disply correct addresses for locations and is sometimes two blocks off. Maps are mostly accurate except for subdivisions or areas that have been built within the last three or four years. Hopefully updated maps will be out shortly...at NO CHARGE. I've downloaded the patch from Navman so now I'm waiting for more patch and map improvements. Reception is great. Without external antenna I've mounted it on the face of my dash, not out in the open exposed to the sun and thieves and it never fails to aquire. Even in the garage. Volume could be a little louder. Color touch display rocks. Overall pretty good unit, needs only a few upgrade improvements, like address/position accuracy better than a block or two. 50-100' would be nice!"
2,"Looks like it is simple, but is really CONFUSING!","I bought this map system because it looked easy to use, but instead, it was very confusing.First, all the maps were not on the device. I had to select some from the CD's. Next, I had to keep going back to my PC to make changes.Once I got the right maps loaded, it was slow to give me directions while driving. I guess it is meant to be used at slow speeds. Not very handy if you are in a hurry.One day, I left the charger cable at home (while changing maps at my PC), so I though the battery could hold me for a short trip. Apparently, the battery does not hold the charge long, since it turned off on me. Also, my location started to move off the road!Good for technical wizards, not for regular people."
3,Bad Girls of Bad Boy Records,"This is the fourth single to be released off of their self-titled debut album TOTAL. This single is written and produced by Raphael Saadiq (from the group Tony Toni Tone. Backed w/When Boy Meets Girl, Do You Think About Us offers the album version as well as a hot remix by Jermaine Dupri. A very rare title-a must have for the Total seekers."
4,History enriches canoe trips,"Read this before, during, and after your Boundary Waters canoe trip and enjoy finding the places past and present intersect."
5,Nice shoes,"Very nice, comfy shoes (I got them in sand colour). My boyfriend fell in love with them right away, true to size."
3,"Had to see it, just to rate it","B movie but the plot was nice. A young musician, out of work and driving down a road stops at a bar and manages to get a job as a hanyman at a lodge managed by a quarrelsome married couple. This film has a few interesting twists, reminiscent of ""Diabolique"".Actually from the cover of the DVD and the story line, I thought this might be a werewolf movie. Wrong!The photography was good at times and then bad. I got the feeling that it was either hit or miss from the director's chair on this one. Rent, don't buy."
5,One of My Favorite Henleys,"""A Year and a Day"" is in my Henley top 3, along with ""Enslaved"" and ""Desired"". It was sweet, sexy, and suspenseful all at the same time. The only problem some readers might have with this book is that it is heavy on historical detail. Usually I don't care for too much history (even in the historicals I read), but I didn't mind it so much in this one since it dealt with one of my favorite time periods, Robert the Bruce's Scotland and his rise to the throne.The hero and heroine in this book are more likeable, believable, and loveable than in the majority of Henley's earlier novels. Their relationship progressed wonderfully, the plot was engaging, and the dialogue was very sexy. Even the relationship between the chief secondary characters was intriguing.If you're already a Henley fan, this book is a must have. If you've never read her before, this is a great place to start."
3,Too much history - too little characters,"After reading A Year and a Day I felt that I had taken a too long course in Scottish history. Lynx could have been a good character but he was matched to a poor female opposite. Just imagine in that day and age - a serf not wanting to marry the ruler/laird/lord! Give me a break! She would have jumped through hoops for the chance. Overall, the character plot got bogged down in the Scottish history scenes. I found myself wading through them ""Evelyn Woods"" style."
3,"good history, bad taste","Enjoyed the history but decried the use of 20th century obscenities. The ""lust"" scenes were grossly portrayed, certainly not romantic. V.H. should write history books and leave out the ""romance"" until she knows what love is."
3,A bit slow moving,The romance was lacking I feel she is trying to write books with more of an indepth story line rather than the usual banter between characters and romance.
2,bearly okay,"I didn't hate it but I certainly would not recommend it. I agree with the others who commented on the dialogue. Also, I was wondering, would she be Lady Jane or Lady Lynx? I thought that it should be Lady Lynx since she was not born into nobility."
1,THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH ITS PRICE.,"I totally agree with the reader from Chicago. THE AUTHOR DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE PERIOD SHE'S WRITING ABOUT. If her goal was to make the reader better understand the dialogues, doesn't she think the reader would've bought a Contemporary Romance instead? Henley is one of the worst, if not the worst, authors when it comes to dialogues. Her sentences are too simple, uninspired, and often silly. How's this for author's idea of a 13th century response?: ""I am bad.""This book is laughable!"
3,I got bored in the end,The beginning of the book was extremely awkward to read(first chapter only). Then the book stopped being wierd and showed promise. I got bored in the last 100 pages and never finished the last 40.
