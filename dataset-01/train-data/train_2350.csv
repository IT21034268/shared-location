3,Colorful,Colorful is what I would say about this vhs. The cover wasnt in very good shape although not horrible. I did tape some of it so it wouldnt tear more. Other than that my son was very happy to get his 2 pack vhs tapes.
1,Rainbow Beard is scary!,My 3 year old daughter enjoyed the first tape in the box but the Rainbow Beard video was definitely too scary for her (I thought it was rather awful myself!).
4,"Ghost Story was far, far better",Too lenghty in narrative which detracts from the drive of the main plot. A good writer who has done better
1,Yawn...,"Well, nobody around seems to agree with me, but I must say that this book was a huge disappointment. I just finished reading it, and man, did I have to fight to not just give up and read something else! Straub struggles to make the killer Koko scary, but it just doesn't work. The ""inside the killers mind""-sequences just feel pathetic; Straub should consult Bret Easton Ellis before he tries it again. Don't waste your time reading Koko, people, there are so many good thrillers out there."
5,The scariest ghost story I have ever read!,Read this book if you want to have nightmares in broad day light. I hope they make this one into a movie. John Carpenter should direct
3,pretty good,"This book would have a five star rating if it weren't for the lacklustre ending. As well, some of the so-called good guys in this book are awful and much of the time I found myself hoping they would get killed. Don't even get me started on the utterly incomprehensible plot twists."
2,Koko Nuts,"Peter Straub is one of those gifted writers who tends to over-write his books, and this is one of his prime examples. While ""Koko"" has a riveting plot and some sharp characterizations, it wanders on so aimlessly that it's easy to lose interest about halfway through. As some reviewers noted, the identity of Koko is spotted easily early on, and even though it doesn't totally eliminate the suspense, it makes it harder to get involved in the book. A couple of riveting scenes are truly frightening, but overall, this is a vastly overrated novel. The lack of a resolution in the end is disappointing too, although I understand this is the first in a trilogy of novels that includes ""Mystery,"" and ""The Throat."" I will have to reserve final judgment until I read those two. I recommend ""Ghost Story"" and ""Floating Dragon"" over this clunker."
5,The Vietnam war as never seen before,"Koko is a great novel. A group of very different people with the common misfortune of having served in Vietnam together try to find and apprehend man from their old platoon who they suspect is responsible for a series of murders. Before reading it I never had any interest in the events in Vietnam. But now I want to learn more about it. The story was good. The idea of a group of war vets who don't neccessarily like each other cooperateing for a greater purpose is a fascinating concept. The twists and turns in the plot keep the novel going strong throughout most of its entirety. Only most though. Even though it has interesting plot twists, the going door to door questioning strangers bit gets a little old. Overall this is a must read novel."
4,Very Good Mystery,"This is as much a war novel as a mystery, as many of the flashback scenes depict war at its worst. Harrowing scenes in some cases. Out of the war comes Koko, a serial killer who is unknown but who is suspected by Mike Poole and others in his 'Nam platoon to be Mr. Underhill. Prodded by Harry Beevers who thinks they can make money by solving the Koko mystery and then selling the story to a publisher a few ex-soldiers start seeking out Underhill. Lots of suspense and unlike ""Ghost Story"" which (in my opinion) did not succeed in holding a reader's interest throughout, this novel is a page-turner. OK, some scenes are a little forced and there are moments which stretch credulity, but overall a very good and intelligent read."
2,Mediocre mystery novel,"I picked up this book after reading a much better book by Straub, "" A Ghost Story"". I was really let down by how little this book grabs you. Really. At best its a decent mystery novel. In this book Straub gives the reader little reason to care about what the ending holds. Seeing how most reviews of this book here are pretty positive, i guess i will have to file this under ""to each his own,"" but let me say this: I was perusing the rave review blurbs that are often put in decently successful paperback novels, and this critic emphasizes how this novel, more than just about any other, has an unguessable ending. BS. The twist is put out there, in the first chapter, right under you nose so blatantly its not even funny. ""Hmmmmm, i didn't even know that his first name was Manuel."""
5,Have only done 3rd Trimester Yoga,"I wish I had bought this in my first trimester. I love how there are multiple workouts for each trimester and a bootcamp for after baby. I know I will use all of them eventually. When I have baby #2 I will use from beginning. The instructor is enthusiastic but not spastic like some videos. The 3rd trimester yoga is very easy in my opinion but probably best for me being in my 8th month. I'm a runner so it's been hard for me to slow down. I love that the yoga is only 26 minutes versus the other DVD I had that was 55! I can do this before or after work and don't sweat (I normally sweat during yoga). I will give an updated review once I try the other DVDs. Also, nice that they come in one case so you don't have to search for multiple cases on your shelf. Enjoy! :)"
5,"Lindsay Brin's Complete Pregnancy 4-DVD Workout Set: Cardio, Toning PLUS Yoga",This set is one of the best workout videos for pregnacy I have found. With each concentrating on each trimester and modifactions to your fitness level you know you will have a safe and healthy workout.The yoga is wonderful too. These workouts prepare you for birth and the bootcamp will help rid you of any baby fat.
3,"Quite enjoyable exercise, not so with the background music","When I start googling for pregnancy exercise, I stumbled upon Lindsay Brin's website which describes her fitness journey during pregnancy. Lindsay is easy for the eyes, very nice to watch her which is why I decided to purchase this DVD.The programs were divided by trimester and I started using from the second to the third trimester program. Although I pretty munch enjoy doing these exercise programs, I found the background music is just so terrible. It was just music playing the same melody over and over again which at certain point I find it irritating."
1,Not what I thought,"When I bought this set of DVDs I was looking for something that would really work me out, but also keep in mind that I was pregnant. I was used to doing Jillian Michaels DVDs and wanted something that would kick my butt like that - after reading reviews and looking at several different ""pregnancy work out"" DVDs I decided to try Lindsay Brin since the reviews were generally great, saying it was good cardio etc. - I have to disagree; I could barely get through 1 workout because I was so bored. She's a darling girl and I loved her personality but I was really hoping for something intense and a much faster pace - I haven't tried the yoga, and will for sure since I've been unable to do my regular yoga due to the expanding belly, but the cardio and toning aren't something I'll do again - I just need a little bit more to feel satisfied in my workouts - but that's just me! I know a lot of others have liked it and get a good workout from it!"
5,"BEST PREGNANCY DVD""s EVER","I wish I would have found these DVD's years ago. I'm pregnant with my 6th baby and have several other pregnancy video, and this is by far the best out there. Being a former athlete I needed a good workout, and this was it!!! Love it, love it!!!"
4,GREAT PREGGERS WORK OUT,"1ST TRIMESTER WORK OUT IS GREAT , YOU'LL WORK UP A MODERATE SWEAT WITH OUT OVER EXERTING AND IF YOU ARE FEELING ENERGETIC YOUCAN ALWAYS INCREASE THE WEIGHTS LBS YOU USE OR DO THE 20 MIN YOGA SEGMENT RIGHT AFTER THE CARDIO /TONING 30 MIN SEGMENT OR SPLIT THEM UP IF YOU ARE TOO POOPED.ONCE I MOVE INTO THE 2ND TRIMESTER I'LL TRY TO POST SOMETHING ON THAT SECTION BUT SO FAR I FEEL LIKE I GOT MY MONEYS WORTH.1 x WORKOUT DVD PER TRIMESTER AND A POST PREGNANCY WORK OUT DVD AS WELL! YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE."
4,great club,"the club is great. the only problem i had is that the tool with directions was NOT sent with the club...and amazon does NOT send replacements...so i have to find one. seems strange to me that i have to correct an amazon mistake.......how can you replace something when you never got it.......other than that, a great club"
3,"Ambiance Romance Mug, 14-Ounce Set of 4","I purchased to fill in with original 8 pc. setting from Ross Simmons. These dishes being ALL hand painted are lighter in color (understandably)but find that they chip easy and get little inside cracks from the microwave. Ones purchased from Dept. stores are same way and don't know why. Anyway, I had no other options since they are being discontinued in stores.....just be careful !!!!!! Color is as shown....my original ones from Simmons were darker in color. I love drinking coffee out of these cups.....nice size & shape."
1,Very poor quality,"Not sure if it's just mine, but the case I received was of low quality. It didn't quite fit the new RAZR which is my fault for trying however the case didn't function on it's own. The snap in the back would not fit together properly had the phone been the correct size. I ended up throwing this away."
2,don't be poached by this poacher,"As mentioned by other reviewers, the egg cups' coating delaminates after a few uses. Also disappointed that, regardless of use of additional nonstick remedies (oil, PAM, butter) the eggs stick to the cups anyway. I'll try RSVP for remedial action."
5,Great product!,We use this about every 2 weeks and it still looks new. Cleans up easily. I wish I'd bought it years ago!
5,my favorite cooking book,"French native,I have a LOT of cooking book! , but this one is my favorite! You'll discover a lot a new ""saveur""... Easy and fast recipes..."
1,charred duck a jojo,This title was given by my butcher when I asked him whether a duck can be roasted for 2 hours and not look like a charred corpse. The duck jo-jo's veggies were charred as well. By now I have tried quite a few recipes by now and quite often the timing and quantity is completely off. At least I hope this is not what he serves in his restaurants. No go. Waste of money.
5,An unusual cookbook with straight forward fantastic recipes.,"I once read that if you can find a single worthwhile recipe in a cookbook, it is worth having on your shelf. This text has several that a neophyte can easily master. The ingredients are somewhat difficult to find, but the Asian food stores in my area carry the required elements. Furthermore, the author offers suggestions on which dishes to serve with each other. Overall, a welcome addition to my culinary armamentarium."
5,Great book go to time after time,Great book go to time after time.I have had this book for years and out of the almost 100 cookbooks I have I use this one the most. A must have
4,Unexpected flavors from unexpected combinations,"I bought this book, expecting the best. He uses ingredients that are hard to find in a major metropolitan area (Boston). Oh, but once you find the ingredients, the recipes produce wonderful results. I tried the Rice Paper shrimp and herb rolls, with 5 minute dipping sauce. It was a case of a dish being more than a sum of its parts. The man is a culinary genius. It was one of very few recipes where I couldn't picture the taste before I bit into it. I can't wait to try more of these recipes."
4,Intriguing,"I thought this book was very intriguing, to say the least. Throughout the book, Bok brings up different ""lying"" scenarios that force the reader to think what would be right and wrong for the situation. The book helped me better understand the consequences lying and deception have on each one of us.Lying is all too commonplace in our society today. This book focuses on the consequences lying and deception have on each one of us. If you want to realize the personal and social ramifications lying holds for us all, read this book."
4,Questioning your ethics?,"I read this book for a ethics class and was very impressed. While most books used for this class were presented in ""text-book"" style, Bok presents her book in a form that makes this book a good read for anyone.Bok discusses many ethical and moral issues, while staying centered on lying and deceit. Her book presents many contradicting views and beliefs, allowing the reader to discern how they view these ethical dilemmas."
4,this book will make you think...,This book includes so many modern day examples mixed with scholarly philosophies about lying. I like that many different beliefs are included and debated. Bok presents some reasonable and also some quite bold ideas about this controversial subject.I would recommend this book because it contains many thought-provoking scenarios and demands the attention of the reader. This book is not afriad to address the power lying can have in relationships and in society. I felt I gained a greater understanding of my own feelings about lying by reading the ideas of others.
4,Great work - Great Author,"Sissela Bok has taken on an incredible task: to analyze lying and what place it has in our society. She carefully dissects the reasons and justifications for lying and offers suggestions of non-deceptive alternatives. Most of all, I think Bok emphasises the fact that we should never lie (no matter the degree of lie) when there is a ""truthful"" alternative available.If you think you're an honest person who never tells a lie, think again. If you think you live in an ""honest"" society, think again. Bok will open your mind to a world of lies that exists in our society, and often times exists even within ourselves. You will be a better person and a better contributor to society by reading this text."
4,Thank you Sissela Bok,"On the subject of lying, this book is the best of the lot. The author tackles the hard questions like, what is lying, while many of the more erudite academic authors skirt that detail. This book originally appeared in the 1970's before the tendency to morph moral issues into scientific incarnations was intellectually acceptable. So it remains the most honest book on the subject of lying."
5,Exactly as Promised,"From the expected delivery time to the condition of the book, everything promised by this provider was carried out."
5,Thought provoking arguments on moral erosion and lying,"I found this book thought provoking. Through references, contrasts, and scenarios, Sissela Bok challenges the reader to consider the effects of lying on the individual, relationships and society. The author systematically covers the spectrum of lies from ""little white lies"" to avoid an unwanted dinner invitation to the arguably moral lies required to survive in a totalitarian state - taking the reader step by step through a journey of increasingly complex moral questions. The book argues that lying, as it is often conducted in society, often lacks the moral basis of those few case where it can be justified."
2,Yawn,"Could not finish this book. Felt bogged down by all the name dropping of authors which didn't seem important to move the plot along. Perhaps some creative ending that makes this approach tangible may be further in, but I can't get there"
3,It's Ok,A little slow reading. I keep picking it up and reading a little and then putting down again.First time author for me.
1,Not worth the $1 I paid,Got this as an Amazon $1 deal. Wish I could get my money back. Waste of time. Written by someone who seemed to be trying to impress someone other than the reader. Skip it and any others by this author.
4,Pretty good,Very old school...I enjoyed it...!!!! Would recommend to anyone who loves a good old fashioned detective story. Loved the gat story line
3,A difficult topic and a difficult book,"At first I found the wide differences in the reviews of this book to be remarkable. Then I looked at the reviews of the other Hapsburg overview books and found them about the same--a wide range of opinion.I can say for sure that this book was not the right one for me. I was looking for that one book does all--takes me from neophyte to expert in one easy step. True, that is probably asking too much.Beyond that, the book is indeed a difficult read. Not only does the author jump around, but his style is complex and his word choices are sometimes suspect.Still, I did learn much. Unfortunately I cannot say that I actually enjoyed the book."
3,1000 year history in one book,"The book covers a wide length of time and covers the entire empire, Spain, Netherlands, Austria and Hungary. While I learned alot, there is much more to the empire than can be covered in this book. It is easy to tell the writer is passionate about the subject and has created in me an interest in learn more about the specific rulers and territories."
3,good basic overall look at habsburgs,"very good information on the early lineage of habsburgs, that are not covered in modern history. not a great deal of information of the habsburgs who went on to romania and other parts of the austrian-hungarian empire through marriage. this book and ""Fall of the House of Habsburg"" does not give enough weight to the to the ability of this empire to keep together the balkans for over 100 years. and both books do not address the misery of the splits in the former empire.the current ethic,regional, and spiritual wars. a decent read, but i hope that a scholar of a/h would write a positive book on their achievements and its relation to the current situation in the balkans. this book is a good addition to a library of european history. a good read and another part of what created modern europe."
4,Easy Up Training Pants,"These are easy for little hands to pull up and down. My 2.5 year old daughter has to do everything herself and I can know that they won't frustrate her to pull them on. Also she love's the characters on each one and often picks out the ""perfect pair"" for bedtime."
5,As advertised,This video is excellent for seniors or people who have problems getting up or down from the floor. I take chair yoga twice a week in a senior group and this video is a wonderful supplement to that. These are great stretches with wonderful excersises for your entire body.
4,yoga,I wish the sessions were divided more into sections instead of ran together. I do love the routines though. very happy
5,chair yoga dvd,This is an excellent dvd for someone who cannot do the regular yoga positions. There is a wide variety of sessions to try. A good workout with your choice of how long or strenuous options to use. Love it!
2,moves too quickly,"If you are a senior citizen looking for truly ageless techniques and gentle chair yoga, this presentation moves much too fast. Plus I somewhat hurt my neck by following along. Do not recommend for those ""slightly out of shape"". I felt more tired than rejuvenated."
3,A little disappointed.,"I bought this DVD because of all the good things that were said about it in the reviews. And yes, it does have a lot of good stuff on there for Seniors and those with disabilities. There is a lot of different routes to go with this DVD. BUT----I do find it a bit choppy when it changes from scene to scene. It is not a smooth transition that you would expect to see on a professional DVD. And---The section for being able to hear music along with the meditation portion does not work. The only part that works is the songs only section. For those two things, I was disappointed. I expected a more professionally made DVD. Will still use it, but believe it should have been made better. Don't think I will buy any other volumes of this DVD that are offered."
3,As expected,If a person has balance issues unable to get up and down off the floor and wants a stretch video I would recommend this DVD.
5,A book to read,"If you are one of those people who loves to read about life, love, adventure read this. Make sure you have weekend free because you will not be able to put this book down. Better than the movie!"
5,One of her best,What a story...you won't be able to put it down. Do you like romance? Do you want to take a journey to some place you've never been? Do you want to get a glimpse of what it would be like...? This is a book that does all of that. Very romantic & a super story!
2,Boring,"My little sister loves Danielle Steele so as a new writer who loves to read I picked up one of her books. Hey, someone who is so well circulated has to be good, right? I shouldn't have just come up for air after reading so many creative writing books. I found the writing nondescript and flat. Her only saving grace was that she got around using ""he said"", """"she said"". That technique I had never seen and so have to thank her for. That said, the story moves well. I'll have to pick up another one of her books before I can really figure out what I'm missing."
4,The Ring,This book kept my interest and I found myself turning page after page to see what was happening next. I certainly would reccomend this book to all. Thanks Amazon for putting it on my reccomened list. I bought the dvd with this and three other Danielle Steele movies. Can't wait to see it....
5,Late Soviet Rock And Roll,If only this music was available back in the late 70's and early 80's when I was trying to learn Russian.If you are trying to learn Russian this will be an interesting suplement to the dry text book activities.The lead vocalis's (Victor Tsoi) has an unusual voice that I can only compare the vocals heard in the Doors.The subject matter is often anti war.A Russian friend compaired Victor Tsoi to John Lennon.Enjoy!
5,good stuff,"I like the stand, it's a bit lightweight but works great for what I'm doing with it. The weight and how well it folds up are very convenient since I'm traveling with it."
4,Customary satisfaction:,"I have ordered several of these pants over the years.They are excellent work pants, however, not too durable. The latter is probably due to the fact I keep placing too many items within the pockets"
4,Perfect,"I bought this for my niece and nephew, who were 7 and 8. The loved it! Not only does it have their well-loved Star Wars characters, but it was at a simple enough level that they could learn how to play easily. Even I could play a little! I also liked it because ""dead"" Lego characters much not the same as animated humans."
3,Great game but buggy,"This game is super fun and I'd give it 5 stars fro everything, except the game is pretty buggy. Not just the occasional character becoming invisible or struck behind something (switch to other character, drop out and then drop back in), but sometimes some have to restart the game kind of bugs. There have been three occasions where I would get struck in a stage and would have no choice but to restart the machine (gamecube) and redo the stage. Really takes a lot of the fun out of the game."
4,fun for yound and old,"This game was a surprise for our son, but enjoyed by his Dad as well! The item was shipped in a timely manner and exacly as it was described."
3,Not as fun as Lego Batman according to my son,While Star Wars was a nice change of pace for my son (6 years old) who was playing only Lego Batman for a few months he still reverted back. We just got Lego Indiana Jones and he says he likes this one better than Star Wars. I think they are all great and it's nice to change it up a little every so often.
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun!","What can I say? My 8 and 6 year old sons LOVE this game and keep returning to it month after month. That's probably because they love lego and Star Wars, so if you love these two things then this is the game for you! Best of all, it meets their mother's stringent standards against gaming violence."
3,Okay video,The game came quick and in good condition as for the game itself. The case was cracked but the disc was fine. I would recommend to others.
5,"Lots of Fun, Lots to Explore","While not horribly difficult, this game is a lot of fun for anyone who even knows a tiny bit about Star Wars. The concept is creative and the tongue-in-cheek humor makes it all the more fun.As I said, it's not horribly difficult to make your way through the storyline play. However, there are enough collectibles which require unlockable characters to retrieve that the fun is extended into free play for quite a while.I highly recommend this game."
2,Should be better,The game doesn't give you good pieces to build your own Lego character. The invincibility is too expensive. I want the characters to be able to talk. I want Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga to be available for PS2.
5,Lego Star Wars ROCKS!,"I got this for my brothers for their birthday. They cannot keep off of it! I have to wake up early to get on our console on weekends. When I have stolen a few moments to get on it, I have discovered some of the most amazing secrets. The minikits are the most fun things to collect. If you get all 10 minikits on 1 level, you complete a Classic Star Wars vehicle. The most fun ""move"" is probably when you press ""X X Square"" with a Jedi. If it is a Jedi, they jump way up high in the air, and stab the ground with their lightsaber. If it is a Sith, they do the same thing, but they do not sink into the ground. The sith's, they just sort of bounce their lightsaber off the ground."
5,My 4-year old son loves this game!!,"I bought the PS2 Lego Star Wars1 for my 4-year old son earlier this year. This became his favorite PS2 game and turned him into a Star Wars nut (which brought back some nostalgia for me). So, heading into Christmas my son's only request for Santa was ""Lego Star Wars 2"".Well, my son was a good boy (sort of) so Santa brought him Lego SW2. My son actually enjoys this game more than Part1 due to the extra touches such as more vehicles to ride in, etc.I think the best feature of both these games is the ""drop-in, drop-out"" player2 feature. I can pop in and help my son through a difficult part then exit back out.The game does deal with ""cartoon violence"" and I try to reinforce to my son that they are just lego characters going through an imaginary adventure.Overall, this is an awesome series and I hope the Company keeps making other creative Lego video games...how about Lego Raider's Of the Lost Ark!!- JT Clark / San Jose, CA"
5,Great Game,My son loved this game. It was a great game for a 5 year old and up. He has played it many times over.
5,Cool game.,"Awesome game for any Star Wars fan. Has great replay value and works great. Good for kids, not for cats without thumbs."
4,soo fun,"my bf and i love legos. we buy lego sets and build them (yes, we are are adults). they're such cute little detailed toys. so of course a video game where you can control little lego dudes sounded like a lot of fun... and we were not disappointed. i am guessing most people who enjoy legos also have love for star wars. you get both in one, fun, cute game. i love playing through the storyline, as all other reviews say, it keeps to the movie, which is really neat. my bf and i spent countless hours playing as a team until we completed the game together. what a fun time! the game makes you laugh a lot too. we're going to get Lego Star Wars I now and fight over who gets to play Anakin."
4,Camcorder bag,"This has turned out to be an excellent bag for the PV-GS500 I purchased. It has a detachable bottom section to store the power cord and charger in it which is nice. It is able to hold the camera, spare tapes, pretty much everything you need but a tripod with no issues. Only thing it is missing is a shoulder strap, and I personally do not consider that a big deal."
4,very good and practical,"This is the perfect case for travelling, it is very good, fuctional and practical. It is small enough to travel with and large enough to fit everything related to your cammera (cables, batteries, etc)."
3,Entertaining but not Saylor's best,"I find it absolutely fascinating that neither the author, nor the other reviewers comment on the moral and social issues regarding Bethesda's status as a sex slave. In antiquity I am not sure how this was looked at, but I am pretty sure that the fact that Gordianus' only slave is a beautiful sex slave would bring many a snicker amongst Gordianus' peers and family (though as far as I can tell from this book (and Roman Blood) Gordianus has neither).The mini-mysteries in this book are not very complex, but the stories are interesting as they contain many snap shots of the ancient world. I would recommend this book only to those who are big into Roman history or to those who are already fans of Mr. Saylor and his Gordianus."
3,Great fun,"This collection of short mysteries all feature Gordianus from Ancient Rome. I haven't read any of Saylor's other books, so I can't connect them to his others, but I certainly am interested now. This delightful book of historical fiction is rather unique and memorable."
4,A good selection of short stories,These collection of short stories by Steven Saylor add new insights into the character of Gordianus the finder as he begins his investigating career in ancient Rome. His early relationship with Lucius Claudius and Beshesda are done well in the confines of these stories and add the missing link between his other books.
3,Awfully cute...but damaged.,"Very cute helmet - trailing lights around the crown set off by your toddler's motion. The helmet is a wee bit too big for my little one, but I'm sure her noggin will grow into it soon enough. My only bummer is that the helmet had a crack in the very top, about 1"" long. Buying online is great when you don't have to make returns."
3,descent,This flag is shorter than expected. I bought other 3x5 flags but this one noticeably comes up short. Not a show stopper as the difference is only an inch or so.
5,Great product - still flying after a year,"This flag is well-made and hasn't lost it's color, or shredded after a year in Charleston's high winds, so I'm happy."
5,touching historical work,"Having lived in ""the cottage"" at Sharksmouth, this book came to life. You feel the magnitude of these remarkable women from a time when it was not the norm for women. The sense of their accomplishments exudes from the pages. It is written with tenderness and wit. Truely an enjoyable read on a snowy night with a crackling fire and a glass of wine. It reminds me of ""A Woman of Substance"" by Barbara Taylor Bradford."
4,Pretty Good,"Nice and relaxing. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there's a few songs I didn't care for, but that's my own opinion. It's good music to relax too."
5,A varied mix -- four good screen couples,"This DVD offers quite a range of couples. W.C. Fields and Mae West marry but never quite get together in My Little Chicadee. Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant star in Charade, a suspenseful and sometimes comic adventure before they are officially a couple. (The film holds up amazingly well and still comes across as smart and stylish.) Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray are a couple bound together then destroyed by their mutual larcency. Last, but far from least, the couple Doris Day and Rock Hudson. Pillow Talk (1959) plays much better than I would have expected. It was a fun romp. (Doris Day was not a virgin, by the way, but did not have a boyfriend currently, whereas Rock Hudson seems to have far too many girlfriends at the same time).The DVD is beautifully restored. The trailers were not, but the films themselves were dazzling in their clarity and color.The commentary of Pillow Talk was especially interesting."
5,Awesome.,"Durable, Functional, Affordable, Quality. What more could you ask for? It has great sound quality and is very compact, works great with my O'neil headphones."
4,a bit heavy but still worth it,Product works great but it's a bit heavy. For example I use small standard ear buds with this extension cord at my desk. If I'm sitting at the desk that has the CPU on the floor the weight of the extension cord wants to pull on the headphones. They are small ear buds so the weight of the extension can easily pull them out of place. When I sit at my desk that has a desktop CPU the weight is held on the desk for the most part so it's not much of an issue.
3,The sweetest drop?,"Peter Murphy makes such interesting videos and I have to admit when I found out that this was out, I logged on and bought it here. I have only one gripe....""The sweetest drop"" video was missing and I am thinking a few others may be also. It was interesting to see the Dalis Car video, but I'd rather have seen the one or two omitted Murphy videos. To a true fan like myself, this video is a must!"
2,Not Great,I did not personally enjoy this novel as I felt as though the authour was trying to capitalize on the success of Dan Brown but didn't quite attain the level of excitement and intrigue that was needed. Perhaps his second novel will be better. I will probably give him a second chance.
5,an outstanding thriller,This is a story that I did not put down until I read all 448 pages. Being not the big reader that I am everyone was amazed that I had read it that fast. It is a story about faith amd it is a compassionate love story. I really enjoyed it and highly suggest it to anyone who likes to read. And mr glover didn't your mother ever teach you that if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it at all? And how would you know it was that bad if you didn't even read it!
2,Waste of time,"This book would have been better if it had been half as long. It is repetitive, full of nonsense and mistakes. It reads like one of those stupid horror movies where the bad guy keeps on coming back to life and the good guys make stupid mistakes. Makes me wonder why I wasted my time reading the whole thing."
3,entertaining...but not much more,"I picked up this book while on vacation partly because I had just read the DaVinci Code, which I loved and thought the cover was intriguing. Well, here it shows, dont judge a book by its cover. It starts out interesting, but the eventual plot was laughable. I had fun reading it, because I was bored and it had some small suspenseful parts to it, but it ripped off of DaVinci Code alot and wasn't near as good. Well, in conclusion, take this poolside or wherever on your vacation, but don't expect anything that will make you think....at all."
4,Entertaining Read!,I had finished reading tons of Dean Koontz and James Patterson books and was looking to read an author not as well known. I decided on this book by Ricahrd Doetsch and was very impressed overall. It's a good read and very entertaining. You won't be dissappointed.
4,Fits into genre nicely,"Good plot, good ancillary characters, great villain, and globe trotting scenery. The only drawback for me was that the whole cancer plot and emotions were laid on a bit too thick for my liking. I was surprised by a part of the ending, and how an obvious plot line was not followed or given the typical Hollywood treatment. One shootout scene was a bit over the top, but on a whole this was an enjoyable read and I will buy the sequel."
5,The Thieves of Heaven,This is a real great book. I got the digital version and could not stop reading it until the end. Will definitely give you a spiritual boost.
5,richard doetsch,"i finished this book in two days. i definatley recommend reading it, the adventures micheal st. pierre go through to save his wife's life are astonishing. this book is all about faith and love. i dont usually read thriller books but when i heard about this one i decided i should read it and i loved it. i look forward to reading more of mr. doetschs books!"
5,Fantastic!!!,"The Thieves of Heaven is nothing short of brilliant. I am surprised that this is Doetsch's first novel. His writing is concise; his language succinct. In a world full of pretentious, often verbose novelists, it is refreshing to read an author who can illustrate suspense and action with a care for the economy of words. His characters are portrayed realistically; their emotions are human. Though I won't give away the novel, the plot is replete with twists and turns. This thriller kept me on edge from start to finish. One thing is for certain: I will be first in line when the sequel hits the shelves!"
1,"NEW RECIPE, NOT THE SAME COOKIE","Dare changed their recipe, they are now called ""Chocolate Creme"". I contacted Dare they told me, they changed the box to make it more environmentally friendly and it's the same cookie because it has the same product number. I've been eating this cookie for 30 years, I know what it tastes like, these new ones taste like 'Oreos'. VERY DISSAPOINTED."

1,Nice Biography,"I was very disappointed when I got this book. It is a 5 star book if you are looking for her life story and her experience. But, I was looking for tips--a manual--help for competition. She had a section on hair, makeup, and all of that, but they were all a paragraph a piece!! I am sorry that this book says that it can get you ready for competition. Don't buy it if you want help and suggestions, but if you want her story go ahead."
5,SHORT BUT SWEET,"I ENJOYED READING LU'S BOOK, AND I WOULD PASS IT ON TO ANY OF MY FELLOW PAGEANT FRIENDS IN AN INSTANT. THE BOOK IS SO NEAT BECAUSE IT IS PERSONAL, AND THAT IS WHAT I ENJOYED THE MOST. LU'S BOOK GIVES PERSONAL TIPS...INSIGHT TO HER OWN EXPERIENCE AS MISS USA!! I FOUND IT TO BE MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN READING A BOOK THAT TELLS ME WHAT I SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T DO. A BOOK CANNOT TELL YOU HOW TO WIN A PAGEANT, AND THAT IS NOT THE AUTHOR'S GOAL. THE BOOK WAS SHORT AND IT TOUCHED BASE WITH THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF PREPARATION AND COMPETITION. I WAS NOT BORED AT ALL, AND IT IS PERFECT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT AN IDEA OF WHAT COMPETING IS LIKE. I GIVE IT A THUMBS UP!!"
1,"Nothing Special, nothing new",Could have gone deeper into techniques and tips and advices regarding modeling.Vague. Lacks depth. Nothing special compared to other pageant manuals.
5,Catching The Crown,"Catching the Crown is an excellent resource for pageant contestants or for those who wish to have a better understanding of pageants. Lu Parker provides excellent advice and tips on preparing for competitions, and shares her own personal experiences as a contestant and a national titleholder."
3,Good But Not Great,"As a pageant contestant and former titleholder, I eagerly awaited the arrival of Lu Parker's book ""Catching the Crown."" While I did enjoy reading it since it contains lots of personal anecdotes about her experience, I found the book to be lacking in one major area. That area is pageant preparation. I do not feel she significantly covered each topic related to pageant participation. Lots of sections like: ""how to get started"", ""sponsors"", ""mental attitude"", ""make-up"", ""skin care"", ""physical fitness"", etc. are very short and only a couple of paragraphs. The book does not in my opinion give in depth information about how to prepare. If you are interested in pageants and would like to learn how to compete and be at your best, I'd suggest ""101 Secrets to Winning Beauty Pageants"" by Ann Marie Bivans. I feel this book does a much better job of discussing all the factors surrounding pageant competition!"
4,Fairy Tales Not to Miss,"A wonderful collection of lesser-known Victorian fairy tales. The anthology includes well-known writers such as Lewis Carroll, Edith Nesbit, and Rudyard Kipling - as well as 19 others. Black and white illustrations are included, and add to the fun.It's a great book to have in the spare bedroom for guests to thumb through, or even out in the living room. Pick it up - you won't be able to put it down!"
5,My grandson loved it!,My grandson loved it; watched it again with his mom; even she liked it! Definitely a good movie for a 10 year old
3,Cool movie,"Good movie with the exception of Pym....who's voice irritated like a toothache. Other than that Ultron, The Hulk, etc. It was all good but not fantastic."
1,big ball of suck,"Don't waste your time, I am in awe of how people embrace sub-par entertainment with the dismissive ""it's for kids"" line.This movie is not smart, nor the action any good... I want my hour and a half back."
3,Good Start; Needs a Sequel or Two,"Marvel did a good job introducing the Next Avengers to the fans. However, I would have to see where they take this concept before recommending the movie to all Amazon patrons. This dvd is ideal for devout fans of the Avengers."
4,Excellent Look to the Future,"By carrying the story forward to the children and tieing up loose ends Marvel should be able to create a whole new series. Animation and story line execellent, as always"
3,The Next generation,This doesn't follow the comic books so much as the two Ultimate Avenger's animated movies. It is entertaining but if you're a die hard fan of the Ultimate Avengers I doubrt it will be part of your collection.
3,Next Avengers ... grow up a bit more.,"This is okay. I am a Marvel fan from back in the day. I'm looking forward to the new animated features from Marvel. Like, Hulk vs Wolverine and Thor. This one is good but they need to step it up a bit if they want to catch up with dc animation. This one is very predictable and simple. If your going to be simple give me alot of action. I hope they do more avengers, but build up the originals first. They really need to take notes from the Justice League (awesome). I remember reading books when Thor would go off and start yelling,screaming and thunder pops off and it was like ... yeah! I haven't seen any of that in the cartoons. Bring the old Marvel back. Marvel should be breathing life into there characters. Anyway, Hulk vs Thor looks like I may get my wish. This one is like an appetizer."
4,Avengers - the next generation,"Next Avengers - Heroes of Tomorrow... I was reserved in watching this; however,I did watch the 2 Ultimate Avengers movies and said, `Ok'. Next Avengers takesplace a few years after the Avengers battled the monstrous Ultron and lost,leading to the Earth's population decimated. The children of the Avenger aresecretly cared for by Tony Stark and from there... I'd give away the rest ofthe movie. It's as much Avengers as one could think of, with an inside joketold twice... classic to the comic book. Very entertaining."
5,Next Avengers,This is a very good movie. Shipping was fast and on time for my sons birthday. Thank You
4,Pleasant surprise from Marvel,"I purchased this because I really liked the animated series of Avengers films that marvel has produced, and the previews on Hulk vs. Thor appeared to be good. I was not disappointed. I was afraid it would be a spin off of low end animation from a Saturday morning cartoon series, but it is the same quality as the Ultimate Avengers and Iron Man. Tony Stark, Bruce Banner and Thor are present, tying this new storyline into the great Marvel Universe History. A really great new adaptation of the Avengers series, a must for fans to see or purchase."
4,Great new series in the making,"I was really surprised by this latest entry. If this a preview of things to come from Marvel/Lionsgate, then I say ""Welcome!"". The stories are getting better as time goes on. This is good enough to warrant a sequel or even a series (after the kids grow up a little more). Otherwise, I recommend it highly."
4,It had no right.....,"To put it simply, I had very low expecations and was wonderfully surprised. I hope they make another one. A must see, although a few parts were a little scary for my 4 year old - but not too bad."
4,Great one to watch with kids,"I was a little reluctant to watch it after hearing the premise, but upon receiving it as a Birthday gift, I have watched with my girls about 4 times now. The characters are great, the story is innovative and inventive, and there are some very funny moments and interesting character developments. It is heavy on the Sci-Fi. There are some rather stiff voice-acting moments, and the pace seems to rush rather rapidly to the end after a great opening and slow introduction of characters, which is my favorite part. I highly recommend this one to all Marvel fans who want something to share with their kids."
4,Worth The Price of Admission,"While Marvel needs to check its main competition (DC) when it comes to animation quality, this film is light years ahead of the Avengers DVDs that were recently released. While a long time Marvel, especially a Hulk, fan I found the introduction of the next generation of Avengers quite good. This is family friendly movie that will satisfy both long term Marvel fans as well as open up a new world for the younger generation. Now if only they took the animation process more seriously..."
5,"""Those were the times I carried you""","If you want to experience the poem called ""Footprints"", then read this book. For those of you not familiar with the poem it's about the Lord walking along the beach reviewing the life of one of His followers who asked why in the footprints, there were spans of time where there were 2 footprints instead of 4. And the Lord responded with: ""those were the times I carried you"". I have to say those words still bring tears to my eyes as did reading this book about a family who was truly carried by the Lord through a very difficult time. This was such an easy book to read. It was like I was sitting with the author listening to her tell the story. I was surprised to look up from my reading and not see her there it was that real to me.If you already have a personal relationship with Him, you will grow closer while reading this book. If you don't yet know Him, hopefully you will be inspired to get acquainted with Him."
4,Great for small to medium areas,"I hooked up these speakers about a month ago and they sound great. The strings on a guitar to the water rushing by in a movie is very clear. If you are an audiophile, then these speakers are not for you. If you like great music and to watch movies with theater quality sound then these will do just fine."
4,"nice sound, wish it was wireless","Nice sound but wish it was all wireless, I knew it wasn't but that would make these perfect. Installing them isn't the most fun but I expected that."
4,Surround system,"Just got it. Sounds great so far. Definitely made for smaller rooms, like bedroom.sound is good and crisp,just don't turn up too loud as they will distort. They are not loud spekers"
5,Great System,Wooww...! this is my first expression after i connected my new JBL CS6100BG. It looks so great. I had a sony 5.1 reciever and the sony speakers got damaged during fire accident. My reciever was good and was looking for speakers for about a month. tried Polk floor speakers spending $700 but didnt convinced for what i wanted. Bought these JBL speakers knowing its brand name and quality. The woofer is so powerfull it can blow off my apt. and the satellite speakers and strong and sleek looking. The mounting options are great and wires worked well with my living room setup....overall 10/10 for my purpose...would love to buy JBL again....
4,Its still a text book,"The book is pretty easy to read but like most text books, it's boring and you'll probably only read it because you have to..."
1,A waste of money,"This toy as far as I am concerned is a waste of time and money. I have a degree in Criminal Justice and have had training in collecting evidence including fingerprints, so I know how it is done. I tried it on my grand daughters, my 34 year old daughter and myself and could not get any print that looked like anything more then a smear of black ink. Don't waste your time or money on this junk..."
1,Sheese...,"I pulled the book out of the box, delighted it had finally arrived. It did seem...thinner...than I had anticipated, but no matter. I was sure from the desription that it would be worth the 17.95 I plunked down for it.When my child was napping, I curled up on the couch to begin my journey.I read. I read some more. And I suddenly realized that the 'author' has the writing skills of a fifth grader...and I may have insulted some 10 year olds by saying that.Awful, awful book. The plot is all over the place, there's no sense of a timeline, the dialogue is SO phony, and the characters are flatter than the pages.I haven't been so dissapointed since I found out the Tooth Fairy was leaving everyone else five bucks and I only got fifty cents.Don't waste your money on this one...me, I'm off to the publisher's website because I think I may have a promising career ahead of me. :D"
4,Shadow People,"This book was very interesting, i enjoyed it very very much. the only thing i cannot understand why the Author claims that the book is only Fiction, when Shadow People really do Exist ! i have experienced shadow people since i was a child, and they have always fascinated me, that is what made me by this book, and i am waiting for other books like this one to come out. maybe the actual events are fiction, But in reality Shadow People are very very real, just like you and i are. but i really did enjoy reading this very much."
3,Oliver is okay but not as good as Sammy or Danny,"Oliver is an elephant that dreams of dancing in the circus. When there is no space for him in the circus, he wanders around trying to find another vocation and home (e.g. he offers to be a pet to a woman that wants a dog) but nothing works out. Ultimately, the circus man sees Oliver dancing and offers Oliver a place in the circus.My child likes the book but it is not a favorite. Frankly, I think the reason she likes it as much as she does is because the illustrations and format are familiar to her from other Hoff books. Her favorite Hoff book is Sammy the Seal, which I also loved as a child. I think Sammy is a better book for children because its themes and subjects (e.g. the zoo and school) are more relatable them. My child also likes Hoff's Danny and the Dinosaur more than Oliver. So, I would recommend Sammy or Danny over Oliver."
2,kind of out of date,the illustrations were not very detailed and the books spent way more time on really big and ancient dead fall traps than the snare traps for small game that i was interested in. It was okay but not what i assumed.
5,Detailed Description of San Yuan Li,"San Yuan LiOU Ning, CAO Fei, 2003. TV Length, 45 min. Experimental Documentary.Armed with video cameras, twelve artists present a highly stylized portrait of SAN YUAN LI, a traditional village besieged by China's urban sprawl.China's rapid modernization literally traps the village of San Yuan Li within the surrounding skyscrapers of Guangzhou, a city of 12 million people. The villagers move to a different rhythm, thriving on subsistence farming and traditional crafts. They resourcefully reinvent their traditional lifestyle by tending rice paddies on empty city lots and raising chickens on makeshift rooftop coops.Directed by acclaimed visual artists Ou Ning and Cao Fei and commissioned by the Venice Biennale, SAN YUAN LI explores the modern paradox of China's economic growth and social marginalization.Also available in these formats:VOD Rental (Home) -San Yuan LiVOD Purchase (Institutional) -San Yuan Li (Institutional Use)"
2,"A lightweight book, very pro-Kerry","As a political junkie, I loved reading ""Election 2004"", for the behind-the-scenes peek at the candidates' campaigns (well, mostly Kerry's). However, if you are to enjoy the book, you must realize that:a) Newsweek is very pro-Kerry.b) the Bush campaign (wisely) kept them at arms-length.So we get fawning adulation over Kerry's daughters, while Bush's twins are treated as snide pranksters. Laura Bush is ""simple"", while Teresa Heinz Kerry ""takes charge"". The Swift Boat Vets are ""grudge-bearing"" while 527s like Moveon.org are ""groundbreaking"". Kerry's team used ""sound strategy"" while Karl Rove and Karen Hughes cooked up ""dirty tricks"". You get the picture.If you can stomach the liberal spin, it's still a good read and does provide a few tantalizing tidbits (especailly about Dean and how he was perceived by both the Democrats [crazy, self-destructive] and Republicans [manna from Heaven]).The left-wing slant is made more bearable by the fact that Bush won."
3,"Ok, but...","This book should have been titled ""Election 2004: How Our Guy Kerry Blew It"". The main characters are Kerry and his campaign, and the book tells of how they let the bad guys win.Most of the inside accounts are from the Kerry campaign. Understandably, it is likely that the authors had more access to that campaign vs. the Bush campaign. But the underlying, probably unintentional, tone of the book is how the Kerry campaign had internal conflicts and was slow to react to the Bush campaign lies. The book ends with a nostalgic ""hope"" and the possibility of the de facto 2008 Democratic candidate ... Hillary Clinton.To be fair, the book is a good read. Comparisons with the Election Issue of Newsweek are inevitable. For that reason at least, the authors could have pushed for a better job with the quality of the publication. For example, photos were scarce and black and white, and there was no analysis of election results."
1,This book would be relevant if Bush actually won.,"It's called election fraud, and if the media EVER does it's job you'll be hearing a lot more about it. The 2000 election, the 2002 mid-term election, and the 2004 elections were all rigged by the hard-right vote counting and tabulating industry (diebold, es&s, etc.). I am 100% convinced that Kerry won both the popular and electoral vote in 2004. Remember the exit polls? Do you really believe the Reluctant Bush Responder theory put forth by Edison/Mitofsky. If so, keep drinkin' that coolaid. Try http://2004electiontheft.com or http://electionfraudblog.com or Democratic Underground .com forums if you're looking for the truth."
5,Fascinating!,"The true inside story. It was amazing to read what was going on behind the scenes of all the stories that were reported during the campaign. The true character of the candidates was exposed, as well as the influence of those around them. Well written, fascinating...a great read. I couldn't put it down."
2,running back skills,It cost way too much for what was in it. I will look for another source in the future
5,Streetwise Las Vegas Map,"When we plan a trip to a location we've never been to, I always order a map, and this laminated map is perfect. It shows great detail, and is easy to carry. This seller had it in my mailbox in record time! Thanks!!"
5,Great tourist guide,"Very helpful for a first time tourist in Vegas. Very easy to find all the major attractions, and good scale for estimating walking time."
2,Not Worth A Plug Nickel!,"I expected this map to be similar to the Fast Map I have of Washington D.C., or my folding laminated pocket map of Montreal made by Rand McNally. This thing is a flimsy, vague, incomplete, WAY overpriced version of those. Don't waste your money, but if you do, make sure they offer free return shipping because you will need it."
1,This certainly was not as advertised,"This map has a tiny, and I mean really tiny, map of the hotels and resorts on the strip. If, like me, you want to see the locations of the different hotels and casinos do not buy this map. I returned it and am annoyed I had to pay for postage both ways- for an inferior product- that was not advertised correctly."
5,helpful & psychologically honest on a difficult subject,"I was not the intended audience for this book. This book is targeted to those who are to live a lifetime of celibacy. Meanwhile, I am a woman in my twenties who hopes to marry one day. Nevertheless Fr. Groeschel provides valuable advice on helping oneself stay chaste. He discusses the psychological and physical aspects of sexuality that we have in a mature fashion. He discusses how to come to terms with one's sexuality, not only in the sense of wanting sex, but the other aspects of sexuality (how we interact with others, how we dress), talks about dealing with struggles of tempations, and thankfully addresses that repression is a dysfunctional method of suppressing sexuality! I found this book very helpful and recommend it to anyone, including singles who hope to marry one day and simply want to be continent until then."
3,"Convenient, but overpriced.","It would be extremely convenient to get this set for your first master cleanse. The items are all correct to maximize your results, and it takes much of the guesswork out of the equation for beginners. My only issue is that similar items can be purchased somewhere like Whole Foods for far less, around $40 individually. Still, beginners who are unfamiliar with what to buy could do far worse than this set."
3,Crazy pricing,"Gave it 3 stars because it does have everything you need. Gave it only 3 bc it's way overpriced - when I did my cleanse I bought all the same ingredients (exactly the same - brand and all) from my local Whole Foods and spent $55. Bought the book at Barnes and Noble for $11 - a total of $23 less than this ""kit"". Nice inflation."
1,Horrible tasting product!!! Do you not waste your time or MONEY!!!!,"This diet is very restrictive and even though it comes with a great book telling you what to expect and how to make the drink it really only tells you to drink 6-12 glasses a day, that's not very good directions. I tried to drink the salt water but ended up puking. I did try the diet on two separate occasions and neither one worked. The drink itself was way too spicy even without the pepper. It's too bad they don't sell a sample of the drink so people don't have to spend over $100 to see if they can even get it down. NO REFUNDS!!!!! Buyer beware. I'm happy it works for some but if you don't like it be prepared to eat your money. Spend your money on a good nutritionalist instead."
2,"Buy the book, don't bother with the kit.","I have been an avid follower of the Master Cleanse for years, I do it about once or twice a year. Like many other reviewers on here I have to say... don't bother buying the kit. It is seriously overpriced. Each of these items can be purchased at natural food stores, like Whole Foods, or even many natural food sections of your local grocery store. Granted the maple syrup will be pricy, but all of these ingredients together are well under $70. I advise you to buy the MC book, read it through before starting, and find an MC support group online... there are several. They are wonderful to offer advice and help newcomers through difficult times so you know what to expect and don't have to do it alone."
4,Quality products all in one pkg,Quality products which can all be purchased at a whole foods as noted by another reviewer but if you're lazy like me and just want it all given to you than this is a good pkg. would be even better if it included a small hand juicer for the lemons and/or container for the drinks.
5,Awesome CD,I stumbled accross this one by accident and I sure am glad I did! I bought it for my 2 sons who LOVE the cartoon song by Chris Rice. We all really like the whole CD! It was a Very nice suprise. Wish we could have been at this concert!!!!!
5,Awesome!,I was at the concert. I was only 9 then. Soon as the CD came out my mom and I both were excited to buy it and I still listen to it today. Still has the same power and blessings behind it as it did during the concert. My favorite song is the last one..
4,Wired to the Sky,"less freaky than other Wooden Wand releases but no less substantial, this record is consistently good, often great, and on ""Wired to the Sky"", transcendental. righteous, brother."
5,Great Coffee,Forget about drip coffeemakers! Get a Moka Express. Easy to use and tastes great. We will soon be adding the Brikka!
1,Coffee Maker,We used the product about 10 times and the handle broke off so we are returning the item. Not happy with this product.
2,returned because made of aluminum,"i did not realize this item was made from aluminum alloy when I bought. If you dislike using aluminum for cooking like I do, don't use."
2,Didn't Work,The item made coffee once out of five times and was returned. All instructions were followed but to no avail.
1,Broke. Twice!!,"I received a Bialetti Moka Express a year and a half ago and the handle broke off within 6 months. I wanted to try again, assuming it was a defect of that particular Bialetti, and yesterday, less than a year later the replacement Bialetti broke in the same way again!! I don't have a great deal of wrist strength, and when unscrewing the top use the handle which is illogically (or cheaply, to be exact) made of plastic which doesn't stand up to the strength of the aluminum parts.This time around I will not replace the Bialetti - unless the manufacturer agrees to send a replacement for free, and am highly disappointed in the inferior quality of the product."
4,Works effectively,"Bought this to make lattes camping. I felt like the coffee could have been stronger, and it didn't really make 9 cups - more like 4 for a semi decent latte. Downside is it spews up coffee if you try and make a smaller amount than the full pot. Upside is it worked effectively enough for me to purchase a one cup one!"
5,Bialetti for excellent espresso and lattes,I was happy to receive the Bialetti and put it to use in making espresso. A friend of mine showed me how she uses hers and I couldn't wait to get one.
5,No More $4 Lattes!,"I love, love, LOVE my Bialetti Espresso Maker. Easy to use and works like a charm. Goes to show simple really is best, as opposed to the several hundred dollar hi-fi espresso makers sold at the department store. I've been making lattes and cafe au laits on a regular basis, and I couldn't be happier. I've used it for guests, and they like the lattes made at home more than the ones at the coffee stores. This is a GREAT product, works beautifully, and once you get the measurements down, you won't go anywhere else. If there is one complaint I have, it's that scrubbing the inside of the bottom half is difficult due to the small opening. Anyone have a solution for this?"
5,"Great, strong, coffee","The biggest downfall comes from the fact that my stove seems to heat it up slowly, and waiting for it is the hardest part. :) The taste is great though, worth the wait, and worth 5 stars! Nice and strong, makes for a great cappuccino when mixed with steamed milk and froth."
3,Dont put in dishwasher,"I purchased this maker as a gift. They really like the coffee it made. They put it in dishwasher and lost it shine. It become very bold. I'm not sure what it caused, since it is dishwasher safe."
5,Makes delicious coffee,We already had a 3-cup and 6-cup Bialetti when we got this one. We loved the coffee so much in the smaller models that we wanted a bigger one so that we could drink multiple cups. The 9-cup makes enough for me and my husband both to have 2 5-6 oz. cups of delicious coffee. We are very happy with our purchase.
4,definitely a must-buy,"If you're learning Korean, the Handbook is definitely the single most important book you can buy.As other people have said, however, it often lacks a context or structure to make the words easier to remember.Here are a few other publications which may help in this regard:1. the English-Korean VocabuLearn audio tapes (www.pentonoverseas.com)2. Basic Sentence Patterns in Korean (by John H. Koo).3. Korean Through English (Hollym Books)4. Teach Yourself Korean (Mark Vincent) (My enthusiasm for this book is somewhat dampened by the fact that it uses a romanization system, and a silly one at that. However, it does a good job of explaining grammar, and it's entertaining and has a sense of humour).Please write to me if you have comments about this topic."
5,Excellent approach to learning Korean using the Chinese roots,"This book takes a method of using Chinese root words as the basis for Korean vocabulary. It clearly demonstrates how to create the Korean ""compound words"" from Chinese characters and then shows how the words are related based on the roots. For certain types of learners like myself, this is an excellent approach to learning groups of related vocabulary. Thumbs Up!!"
4,Handbook for Korean: My New Addiction,"This book eased the burden of memorizing hanja (Korean Chinese characters). I can honestly say that I am addicted. Helpful, well-organized book. It arrived in good condition."
4,"Love it, wish they'd spent a little more on the printing.","The font seems oversaturated / hard to explain that -uh..... the book is overwhelming - SO many words!!!But it does it's job in helping me related WHY wordsare put together the way they are / the meaning ofthe parts of the words... wish it came with a""copy for your computer"" DVD < no deal. That would makeit instantly searchable. In my dreams. You need toknow what alphabetical order is in Korean to search thebook for the right english word, but it was never intendedto be a dictionary in that sense. It's a reference bookthat reads likecowboyfarmboytomboy <<<<< but in Korean / so you see you can tell that""boy"" is the rootword that the other Korean words are based on.In this, it is what it is. How to study it? No idea yet."
2,glorified korean-english dictionary,This book is nothing more than a glorified korean-english dictionary. It was a bit disappointing since I was expecting more of a textbook-like style.
5,"""SIMPLY THE BEST"", ""A TRUE WORKHORSE""","I have been doing flowbench developed porting for over 22 years. Sometimes my porting bench runs 12 hours a day. I own (in use at this site) more than 8 air die grinders, 8 hand held electrics(makita!), and 2 remote cable driven units. Years ago (1982) I was looking for an affordable electric die grinder, I tried several $80 - $100 units NONE LASTED more than a few days! EXCEPT THE MAKITA YOU SEE HERE! I still have the first 2 I bought, DATED 1982, until a few weeks ago only brushes and a switch had ever been replaced!! These 2 have THOUSANDS of hours use. Finally I had to replace a shaft in 1!! A true industrial quality tool @ a hobby price! Ken"
5,A Great Tool at a Great Price,"I do occasional grinding on heavy steel components, and therefore could not justify spending as much as some of these types of tools can cost. Also, I'm a price-shopper. Amazon handled the order Great. The tool arrived on time in perfect condition. It's a tad light on power for heavy grinding, but I did not find that a problem, as the tool works so well. I needed a variable speed controller for the grinder, and purchased an inexpensive Router Speed Controller from Harbor Freight, and that did the job. Its a great tool at a great price."
4,Die grinders,Makes a good production machine. Good equipment for the price. Found that with a speed control it became very flexible. Quite powerful for the size and weight. Only draw back is no variable speed.Updatedafter using for awhile it works well with the recommended bits but don't try anything else. I chucked up a grindstone that was out of balance and it broke the casing at the change in contour. Good tool just don't expect any more than high speed applications with finely balanced bits.
2,"Makita GE0600 1/4"" Die Grinder",The product seems underpowered compared to its rating. The amazon.com process can't be beat with their great prices!
2,Not what I expected,For the money it was diappointing. It is more of an inspirational dvd versus any training tips.
4,Good old style kung fu movie,"stars Chi Kuan Chun as a young militia man who leaves his fianceeto learn kung fu from an old master. He learns the Toad style along with the Eagle Fist and Dying Fist and also learns about pressure points. His master then tells him a story which sets him off on a mission to find a missing book on how to unlock the pressure points. The young man then infiltrates the house of the man who has the book by posing as a kung fu teacher. The young man has to eventually (with help) face the kung fu master with the book. He learns though that things are not always as they seem. I thought this was a pretty good kung fu movie. Their are better movies out there, but this is a definate must see."
3,another chi kwan chun classic,"Chi kwan Chun is a young student, who studies teh arts of eagle fist and toad, along with an introduction into the mysterious antilock kung fu. Once masterd he is sent out on a mission to regain the stolen antilock manuel. once finding it he discovers that his master is not who he believed, and now has no clue what side is the right one. Many styles such as the eagle, toad, monkey, and the impressive antilock make this an impressive flick."
1,crashed up,"this acer ferrari beside the nice design it does not deserve any penny,i will never buy such item like acer ferrari ever,acer are one of the most low quality computers,i got one 1 year ago and crashed when i was recover the system operating,it is down and acer are not able to help me,they ask for more than a half of the computer value to replace the motherboard when the problem was with the bios flash......"
2,Not the bible,"I would not consider this to be the bible on no-limit. The book starts with an interview of T.J.Cloutier and ends with a few of his road stories. In between there are a couple of examples of how to play certain hands. But in general i found litlle basic big bet poker advice. The tournament section i felt was pretty good. Overall i wouldn't adivce this book to a beginning big bet player. I think they would be better off buying Pot-limit & No-limit poker by Ciaffone/Reuben. If on the other hand you're an somewhat advanced player, then you might find some usefull information in this book."
2,pretty poor book,"This book is pretty poor relative to other poker books.It's not that the book doesn't have anything to teach, it's just that I felt that for the cost of the book compared to the material versus the value of other poker books is poor."
1,Guide to writing portable applications? Ha!,WAP promises to allow you to write applications for all mobile phones. This book's focus on only one browser (and hence only a subset of phones) leads the reader down a dangerous path... only to discover too late that the application won't work on other browsers. And then you're left with no idea what went wrong!
3,Good only for a beginner,"This book does an introduction to the WAP protocol, the various layers in the protocol stack, and a quick introduction to WML programming. This book is not intended for a serious/practical programmer looking for information to create professional WML programs. This book cannot be used as a reference, though beginners would find this book a confidence builder."
1,A poor introduction and even poorer reference,"I really tried to like this book. After all, it's one of 5 titles available for those looking for a reference/tutorial on WML, WMLScript and wireless applications development in general. I found much of the info to be out of date. What little there was didn't focus on practical advice on how to develop wireless apps. It reads more like a textbook, providing a framework for what WAP is, rather than substantive code examples, references to development tools, device pitfalls, etc. I purposely avoided the Wrox title on WAP, but it looks like I have little choice if I want a hardcopy reference to look at."
2,"High hopes, low delivery","I had hoped that this would be a much better reference than it has turned out to be. The examples are poor, the index is next to useless and there are multiple errors in the text. The other major flaw is that only the Phone.com browser/environment is discussed. There is not even a passing mention of the other WAP implementations out there. WAP developers need to know about the various browsers that are making their way into the market, as they each have a different implementation of the WAP standard (similar to the Netscape/IE problems that today's web developers encounter). If you are completely new to WAP then this book will provide you with a good introduction, but you'll need another book as a backup."
1,Totally Frustrating Reference,"This has got to be one of the most frustrating references I have ever bought. The Phone.com browser simulator does not work: I ran it once, encountered an error opening one of the author's samples, and the simulator never ran again. I even reinstalled the SDK, and ended up with the same problems. Perhaps the problem is that this is a beta release. Get the current release version of the SDK from the Phone.com website, and use their examples, and give this poor book a miss."
1,How to write a bad book,"Save your money. Instead of buying the book, download the UP.SDK 4.0 from phone.com, or the Nokia WAP Toolkit 1.3 from nokia.com, or the Mobile ADK 1.1 from Motorola.com. I'm sure you'll find another WAP SDK at ericsson.com. Read through the various documents and cross-reference the online help. If you buy this book you'll have to do that anyway.This book is not a tutorial, and it`s certainly not a reference book. It neglects to explain key fundamental concepts, leaving the reader wondering how the pieces tie together. It rushes through WML and WMLS syntax like a bat out of hell and then presents the reader with a ""real world application"" - a really short chapter dealing with writing a Java Servlet to read a text file."
3,"Earnest, but flawed","This book has a number of flaws, the main one of which is that, as a Phone.com product, it makes no attempt to discuss other browsers or the issues inherent in creating content that works across multiple vendors' products. There is also no discussion of WAP security whatsoever, and the WMLScript section contains too much code and too little prose. Even experienced programmers will find it sketchy. The section on Phone.com's proprietary extensions to WML takes up space that could more profitably have been devoted to any of the topics above.That said, I still recommend it for those working with Phone.com simulators or browsers, and for those trying to get a handle on using Java servlets for generating WML content. It's no godsend for either purpose, but given the near-total absence of other literature on either topic, it's a start."
4,Fantastic intro of how to talk WAP :) Bad typesetting :(,This book offers a good technical introduction to the WAP protocols and also many many examples of wml and also server side example. Very useful for those trying to understand WAP. You will be motivated to learn more about how HTTP works etc after reading this book. The best thing about the book are the clear technical explanations and examples.The book was typeset by a amateur! The text flow and formatting are distracting to the reading of the book.Here are a few characteristics: 1) Inconsistent bottom margins. 2) Too much use of fancy headers. 3) Indiscriminate use of bold font. And many more...
2,Better than nothing...,Two aspects of the book that I did not like: - index is horrible; don't buy this book for a quick reference; it sucks - examples don't necessary work on Phone.com UP.Browsers; ie. fieldsets and caching solutionsOne strength of the book: it's better than nothing; a bit sad that I still had to surf onto the Phone.com developer forum to get answers.
3,Not enought info,"This is an OK book but is too tied to one brand's technology. I found a much better book that seems to cover wireless web development in general: Rischpater's ""Wireless Web Development."" That book seems to be more up to date than this book as well."
1,Waste of money!,"All this is the instructions and qualifications for how to get PHR or SPHR certified. I did not find it helpful at all for the price! It does give a practice quiz (yes, just one) which I suppose is helpful but I would just go ahead and order prep materials and use those. If you are nervous about standardized tests then I guess it's somewhat helpful because it goes in to how to take them and alotting your time...but if you are well-seasoned in them or any testing (as I am) then I would say don't bother."
4,excellent reference,"excellent reference for figuring out wood types. most of the book is in reference format, with very good pictures for identification. there is also a section describing the basic properties of wood and other interesting things to know."
2,book,the book was great and had everything i wanted in it. the condition of the book when it came to my house was awful. it said new when i ordered it but it was definetely used.
5,Wood: Identification & Use (Revised & Expaned),"A friend from Mass. was visiting and brought this book for my Dad to read. Next thing I knew I was ordering a copy. After reading the cautions on some of the woods he has used in the past, he was able to figure out the hives, cough, etc that he has experienced in the past. He is also trying to pick a differnent wood to make his next clock out of. We both feel that this book is a great addition to any woodworkers library."
4,wood idwntification,A dang good wood ID book. Well written and illustrated. A must fot the wood library.
5,great tool,"great for getting into tight spaces, easy to use and good quality tool. will buy more Makita items in the future"
5,Riveting,"I read this book almost a month ago - and I'm still thinking aout it. Clay does a wonderful job of educating his readers on the subject of Islam, yet without it being ""teachy"". The balance of Truth and error is exhibited throughout the book by the characters' action. You're left pondering how strong your faith really is if ever challenged as Mark was. Great read."
2,great while it worked,"There's probably a reason why these are no longer available. Ours lasted 2 years before the electrical part quit working. Since we used it for travel only, it was used maybe 20 times."
3,Does not last long - broke in 6 month,"This coffeemaker is easy to use and you can get a decent cup of coffee, however electric part does not last long. My broke in less then 6 month."
4,Works and handles very well,"It is the perfect capacity for charcoal, ash, dog food, bird food, etc.I would have given it 5 stars except that it's pricey for having been made in China."
5,Used to scoop Fuel Pellets out of the bag.,I purchased this scoop to scoop fuel Pellets out of the bag and then into my Pellet Stove Insert. If works perfectly and stops me from lifting the bag and spilling Pellets all over the Living Room. It is a larger Scoop that is made out of heavy Aluminum. Great quality for the price. Recommended.
5,I didn't expect this scoop to be so nice,"I also didn't expect it to be so big, despite some reviewers mentioning the size. I bought it to scoop rock salt out the salt bag and I'm impressed by how much it holds. The quality and attractiveness of this product is actually overkill for this use, but that's okay because it's nice to be surprised in a positive way."
5,Age Appropriate Hip Hop for Preschoolers,"This CD captures the creativity of children while engaging them on an audio experience of participation, anticipation, and motivation. The songs and lyrical contents are off the charts and the Blue Button is the best! Learning how to mix colors or motivation to brush teeth...this CD will do it!!"
4,Best Brass Band Blows Heavy Stuff!,"This is not a recording for the novice brass band listener. Though the performance of the great Black Dyke band is, as always, virtually flawless, this music is definitely not ""easy listening."" All of the pieces on the CD are first section test pieces, composed especially for the Brass Band National Championships of Great Britain. The best of the best composers (Percy Fletcher, Edward Elgar, and others) are represented. These pieces are written to challange the finest brass bands, and Black Dyke demonstrates why they are often on the top of everyone's list of ""all time greats."" The music represented can and will be enjoyed at some level by every listener, novice or not. For full enjoyment, arm yourself with some liquid refreshment, a full score, and some space where you can crank up the volume a little bit. Marvel, then, at how Black Dyke can achieve such beautiful phrasing and dynamic contrast while playing all those notes!"
5,Black 'n Red is my favorite spiral-bound,"Black n' Red happens to be standard issue in my office. I always preferred the casebound notebooks because most of the notes I take I want to keep and a Casebound Book,Ruled,24 lb,96 Sheets,11-3/4""x8-1/4"",BK/RD (JDKD66174DTOP)/5EA is what's I use for my 'permanent' notes. For casual note-taking, I don't mind the convenience of a spiral-bound book.I always expect quality and convenience from Black n' Red and this is what I am getting with these notebooks. Another positive: it fits well inside my laptop case.I am happy that my office supplies me with these classy-looking, well-made notebooks."
1,Not Teflon!,The furniture gliders I received were not Teflon. They were some other type of plastic. They do not slide well at all on carpet or wood floors.
1,Pfaltzgraff will not stand behind these,They claim they do not make them they just license the design.Mine break so easily and it was just a waste of money. Pfaltzgraff sent a meager 10 dollar gift card for our troubles. pfft.guess I can buy some more garbage from china with the 10 dollars
1,waste of time,horrid book. I cannot believe the garbage that I have to read for school. Might want to just read online for free or something boringggggggg
3,Not what I expected,"The pillow that I recieved was not what I had ordered. The pillow did not have goose down. However, It is still a memory foam pillow that is good."
4,A Beautiful recital!,"The first thing that I noticed about this recording is that Ramon Vargas does not have a ""big"" tenor voice. His singing is very good and so is his disction. Some of his high notes sound a little ""pinched"" (similar to Domingo)but he still hits them with authority. He voice is well suited for Bel Canto. He sings Donizetti's ""Angelo casto e bel"" with pure treasure. This is well worth buying and I do think Ramon Vargas is one of the future stars in Opera."
1,What a disappointment,"Please don't waste your money on this. I read a lot of reviews on various footrests, most of which had only one or two reviews that were all negative. So I figured that only angry people bothered to comment, and it can't be that bad.Three weeks after my order arrived, I had to toss it in the trash. The board broke down the middle. The footrest was not misused in any way. It just couldn't handle more than three weeks of normal use.Unless you have money to throw away, you should keep looking. Otherwise, that's exactly what you are doing with your money--throwing it away."
3,And Now for Something Completely Different,"I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here."
3,don't overlook a giallo,"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" obviously comes from an era when director Lucio Fulci--known mostly for his latter-day gore flicks--was more conscious of his audience and critics. The reason I say this is because, for the most part, the emphasis is on story instead of grisly shocks. That being said, DTaD may not be so easily accessible for fans of ""Zombie,"" ""The Beyond,"" etc. But for those who stick with it (and give it at least two viewings), they'll be rewarded with a giallo that is definitely on par with what Dario Argento put out during the '70s. The story has a murderer making progress through a small town, knocking off children, and the usual red herrings and twists and turns pop up well before the eye-opening ending. Fulci directs with surprising expertise and coherence, something that would go unseen in his movies until 1982's ""The New York Ripper."""
2,Don't Torture a Duckling,"Unfortunately the movie reserve to this title a great treatment, but the movie is a real good italian thriller.But not so great as expected,buts ot ok to watch and file up in your movie libary"
1,Bland,"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is about someone who murders children in the Italian countryside. The motive for these murders is unclear while Fulci makes good use of red herrings to develop a whodunnit flick Italian style--or a giallo as many refer to it. Given the film's age, it is difficult to be too hard on the film, but while the suspense is clearly evident, the film's execution is clearly lacking. Moreover, the film muddles along in a great deal of needless dialogue that works to depress the movie's acting and suspense. However, the mystery of the movie keeps it going (barely) as is the case with most giallos. In other words, the only thing that holds one's interest is who committed the murders, and that's just not enough for me."
1,Terrible,"The model I had was supposed to have a ""safety feature"" where the heater does not work outside of water. It worked for a couple months (both the heater and the safety feature). The heater stopped working entirely inside my fish's tank and, assuming it was broken, I put it down on the ground. A day later I noticed the thing burned a hole in my carpeting and burned my hand. Yes, it was dumb to not unplug it, but considering it's not supposed to work at all outside of water (and wasn't working at ALL inside the water) I wasn't expecting it. I'm just glad it didn't start a fire."
1,Horrible construction,I ordered these slippers as part of a birthday gift for my boyfriend. He LOVED them! He wore them around his apartment TWICE and one of them competely came apart. The sole of the slipper nearly totally detached from the upper of the slipper. He was very disappointed and so was I. I won't be purchasing Reebok slippers again.
4,Warm Slippers - Very Warm,"I bought a pair of these as a gift and another pair for myself. They are very comfortable and sturdy, and they look great. The most striking feature is how warm they are! They are definitely more winter-wear than summer-wear. If you are looking to keep your feet warm, these are the best slippers on the market. If you are shy about foot sweat, not so much."
4,very nice,"I think this was a great product, I bought it as a gift for my father and it was wonderful, I am glad it is made by Reebok a reliable company and I am sure he will love them, when I saw them I thought I made a great purchase."
1,Size chart is wrong,I bought these slippers as a gift but had to return them. Amazon has the sizes wrong. They get the slippers from Shoe Mall and they have the correct sizes. Very disappointed.
1,Wrong Size,You sent the wrong size. I ordered 7-8 I got size NINE. There is no Return Authorizatioin in the box.
2,Bought the cut down the forest version,The book is well written. It presents the various topics in a way that you can examine your own life
4,Greatly enlightening book on Bolivian Films,"A book descrbing in depth the present and past reality ofbolivina filmmakers, actors an d the strong political backgorundbehind it, showing the harsh reality of this 3rd world drug republic. a must for dope users and film freaks as well"
5,Revelation Study Guide,This Bible study guide for Revelation is well written and helps to clarify some of the more difficult to understand passages of this book of the Bible. It has been well received by my Bible study group.
5,"""Music Of The Heart"" is a great soundtrack!!! :)","Being an 'N SYNC fanatic, my main reason for wanting this CD was for the song ""Music Of My Heart."" I was thrilled after I got it to find out that Jaci Velasquez also had a song on the album. I have been a fan of hers ever since I bought her first album, ""Heavenly Place."" Her second album ""Jaci Velasquez"" is AWESOME as well. I was so glad that two of my most favorite artists were featured on the same soundtrack!! ""Music Of The Heart"" is a great soundtrack!!"
5,*N SYNC SINGS!,"I just got the cd and it rulz! It rulz 'cause *N SYNC sing a beautiful song in the cd. Also because I love *N SYNC and love anything that has their gorgeous faces and harmonius voices.gloria estefan also sings well. Also the video is cool. Justin, Chris, J.C. Lance and Joey lool so gooood!"
3,Could be better.,"The only song that satisfies my musical interest is, ""The Music Of My Heart"". Since the movie will be entitled, ""Music Of The Heart"", the song title was appropriate. I found that this compilation was lacking different musical genres. It had a bit of pop, and r&b but what happened to the rest of the musical flows?Apparently the movie is going to be about a teacher (Meryl Streep) who happens to teach Instrumental Music and she is faced with people wanting to get rid of the program. A similar movie about music was on television the other night, starring Amy Grant. I believe, that got across what the ""Music Of the Heart"" soundtrack did not.Music has always been a part of my life. A true musician doesn't believe in favourtism of a SPECIFIC musical style.I felt this album didn't touch my heart at all."
2,A waste of money,"The sountrack is not that good at all. There are only 2 song that i personally like, music of my heart and jennifer lopez's song."
3,PLEASE READ THIS ARTICLE!,"hi everyone! Have you heard all the songs on the cd music of my heart cause i havent! well even if you didn`t hear all the songs it doesn`t mean that the songs aren`t good.so if i were you i wouldn`t go tell everyone that all the songs stink besides ""music of my heart"" because you won`t know until you listen to them! thanks heres my e-mail address alk1@mediaone.net please e-mail me! (and vote)"
3,ZZZZZZZZ ... but in a good way,"For the most part, this CD is easy-listening, with the exception of a couple of songs. In fact, the only song that rouses you to get up and dance is the second track, Jennifer Lopez' ""Baila."" The title track isn't bad, although not as good as other songs N-Sync has released. My favorite song probably has to be ""One Night With You"" by C Note. Like the title song, it was written by Diane Warren, who is, IMHO, the premier writer of ballads out there right now. The rest of the CD is mostly filler ... nice to listen to, but not exactly memorable either. The end track, ""Concerto In D Minor For Two Violins,"" is music for the ears, and easily the best track on the CD."
4,I am an Aaliyah Fan!,"I dunno about the others, but Aaliyah's Turn The Page has certainly mesmerised me. Had a lot of sweet memories listening to this song, so be sure to catch it!"
4,I haven't even seen the movie yet!,"I got this cd, for the nice selection of hispanic artists on it. The Gloria song is pretty, and I like the Gizelle one. The last track is also very unique. I liked the mixture on this cd, and I can't wait to see the movie!"
5,Music Of The Heart,This is a awesome cd this cd is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The best songs on this disc are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
3,NOT the complete Paul Creswick Robin Hood!,"This purchase was intended for my five year-old nephew for Christmas. While this edition does contain the NC Wyeth color plates, the book itself is ""based on"" Creswick's and is definitely not the Robin Hood I remember checking out (over and over) from the local library when I was a kid. Admittedly, this edition, more of an over-sized children's story book, is probably more age appropriate for my nephew. I'm still going to give him the book, but I'm saving it for his birthday. Still looking for the REAL Creswick Robin Hood!"
5,Excellent account of Robin and his Merry Men,"I forgot so many of the details of this story, and was thrilled to read this account of Robin Hood. I totally enjoyed the cat-and-mouse games he played with the Sheriff of Nottingham, and the wonderful camaraderie of the men of Sherwood Forest. Great story, well written. (Forgive the sections where the book page appears in the middle of sentences - it's not that annoying and does not slow down the narrative.)"
4,Listen To The Band!,"The Monkees may have taken the last train to splitsville, since Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork and Davy Jones are touring separately in 2004 and have no immediate plans to reunite. (Mike Nesmith remains off the road.) This 2001 live CD provides a good representation of the latter day Monkees. Davy Jones is outstanding on ""Daydream Believer,"" while Micky Dolenz especially shines on ""I'm A Believer."" Peter Tork takes the lead vocal on the song ""Can You Dig It?"" He also shares lead vocals with Micky Dolenz on ""For Pete's Sake."" The backing band provides solid support throughout the concert, especially on the jazzy song ""Goin' Down."" While not an essential purchase for the casual Monkees' fan, this concert is enjoyable to listen to, and brings back pleasant memories of the Monkees in their heyday."
2,ehhhh,"i donno, i was kinda psyched about an indie film. i didnt love this. if it had been a buck then whatever, but for 3-4 bucks youre better off buying tacos or over-tipping a waitress."
4,"Really good, but failed to capture the true awesomeness of San Diego Comic Con","First of all I really enjoyed this documentary. The challenge is how can you capture 4+ days of awesomeness into a 90 minute documentary, you can't. Anyone seeing this documentary should know that the actual experience is exponential to what you are seeing in the film. On second thought it is already hard enough getting tickets and there is already way too much competition so please just watch the film and don't try to get tickets."
4,Comical,Very entertaining look inside the convention. Can't help getting as involved in the activities as those who attend every year.
4,You get what you paid for.,"Its an okay kit. I had low expectations on the quality based on the price.Its a very easy build. Just five stages of building. The color scheme is simple: Light gray, dark green, gun metal and flat black.The decals are relatively flimsy compared to revell and hasegawa so be careful because it will be easily torn.I don't regret buying this kit. Its a good way to kill time. However, if you have a high skill level, this is not a good one for you. Its not challenging."
2,Disappointing,"This is a disappointing CD to me. The compositions and playing sound half formed, like the players were not quite ready to record an album yet and needed more seasoning. The band never really jells. Harris has obvious skill as a player but his ideas are not that compelling. This sounds like a student effort. I realize that other listeners have come to a different conclusion but these are my strong, and honest, impressions."
4,Storytelling for Kids,"Stories include: The Little Dragon 25:12mins, Orange Cheeks 11:46mins, Woe is Me Bones 6:58mins, and Tulip 5:43mins."
1,Revisionist History - A Book Full of LIES,"This was a book full of lies. Revisionist historians like Moore only write to promote their agenda, which is the theocratization of this country.You want to know what our forefathers thought, what they intended for this country? Read the debates from the Constitutional Convention, the Federalist Papers, The Anti-Federalist Papers. Read the biographies and collections of letters of these great men. Don't get your history filtered through the opinions and lies of a zealot like Moore.Reading things like this, that contradict mainstream thought and reinforce religious ideology, I know, makes readers feel special, like they know something that the rest of poor, deluded American society doesn't. They are wrong. And so is Moore."
5,Just a great book period.,"This book not only needs to be read. It needs to be preached. America is crumbling and this book tells us why and it does it very well. It is a very easy read and very hard to put down. If you care about the state of our nation, you need to read this book."
5,Best book for an intro to the SS,This is the very first book I purchased way back in 1994-95 on the SS.I highly recommend it to people who are looking for a solid introduction to the topic.
5,Great Biography of a Pioneering Mob Boss,"Louis ""Lepke"" Buchalter, the Godfather of American labor racketeering, emerges from the shadow of ""Murder, Inc."" in this great biography by Paul Kavieff. Brisk, well written, and entertaining, it's also accurate and splendidly documented. Lepke was one of the founding fathers of organized crime, who quietly built a massive empire based on labor rackets and narcotics while others dominated the headlines with booze wars, losing it suddenly in an eruption of paranoia and violence while on the lam. This is Kavieff's best book yet, following ""The Purple Gang"" and ""The Violent Years"", and makes his transition of interest from the Detroit to New York underworld seem unusually smooth."
5,Fantastic Introduction to AI,"This book really stands out among the AI texts (I've read 4 others). First, the language is clear and simple enough for undergrads to grasp. Second, there are consistent examples that pervade the text to help the reader apply each method to an established problem. Third, the explanations of algorithms/structures are crafted and phrased to TEACH, not merely to summarize a bunch of material for reference purposes. Finally, the programming chapters allow the student to realize the material, and really think about the problems by implementing them and hashing out the details.I cannot complain about any lack of depth - the length already exceeds 900 pages. To those that desire more, look into academic journals - this is an intro. Moreover, robotics, vision, neural nets, and other topics already have their own ""forked"" research fields, with textbooks of comparable length focusing on those topics alone!Enjoy! This text is sure to get you started!"
2,Superficial and unclear,"Trying to gather the greatest audience possible, this book is superficial, completly unclear and boring. Why? Topics are quickly introduced, concepts are rarely analized deeply, it's more discorsive than formal. With so many subjects of AI in the same book not enough space can be given to all of them, so most of the chapters are lists of important algorithms or concepts, barely explained. Do you want to verify it? See the table of contents and the number of pages, and try to see how much space can be given to every point... not enough."
2,A Little Too Sparse,"As Richard Matheson states in the beginning of ""The Path,"" the goal of this book was to present the reader with a high-level introduction to the works of Harold Percival through a series of ten fictional walks.The problem is that Matheson's presentation is too high-level, so much so that many of the ideas are over-simplified, or only vaguely referenced. Because of this, the concepts lose their impact, and many times appear as rehashed material from many other books available today.I enjoy a majority of Matheson's works, and was excited to find this extension of some of the concepts and ideas from ""What Dreams May Come,"" but unfortunately, Matheson was too sparse on the details. I don't feel any more compelled to pick up the works of Percival than I did before. I wish Matheson would have expanded this book to twelve or fifteen walks, or else would have made the walks longer."
3,smells awfu,this type of brand was different from the brand that I got from the health food store. it doesn't work as good as I thought it would work right.
5,Works better than anything I have tried before,"I have extremely oily skin and this product does what it says it will. I can go quite a few hours now without the nagging ""shine"".I am happy with this product and will purchase more in the future."
4,Absorbs oil,"I too was skeptical of this products oil absorbing properties. I am 47 years old with skin like a 13 year old. I don't even think my skin was this oily during my teen years but hey I guess being peri-menopausal. Anyway, although it doesn't absorb for 12 hours like I would like (I'm still looking) it does a pretty good job for I would say about 8 hours. So far the best product I have found."
3,Great Game,"This was a good game. Virginia starts out a little slow and then catches fire. Ryan Powell never gets hot and he is a leading scorer. Then Syracuse starts a comeback. Few goals and a little old fashioned style of play, the game is never really exciting."
1,Disappointed!!!!,VERY DISAPPOINTED!! This is not a 'vet' kit as it claims to be. What arrived was a broken doctor kit. My child was extremely sad after being so excited expecting its arrival. I would not order from this company again!
1,Keds veterinarian kit,"The kit is small and the pieces are fragile. My nephew liked it at Christmas, but I'm not sure how long the toy will last. Also, the postage was twice the cost of the toy. Very disappointed."
2,Desperate Cult following with no social lives,"It's sick...Thousands of little girls who want to be like her and even more little boys who dream of having her. It's really sad, there is even an entire cult style web page deticated to Ms. Cook run by desperate lonely computer freaks and visited by equally pathetic die hard fans (check out ...for a few laughs in the community section!). This book is meant for these ""people"" and should not be picked up by anyone else. If only these people could understand the probability of a celebrity actually wanting to meet a pathetic loser who ... over her picture every night!"
2,Characters well-defined,"The characters were well done in this book, but that is the best you can say about it. This book was a big disappointment -- not up to Wigg's usual standards. The storyline was trite and sets women back 30 years. Read Wigg's ""Lighthouse"" -- it is 10 times better."
3,Rob???,"Twyla's first husband was a first class jerk! He treated her like dirt and refused to even acknowledge his own son. But she picked herself up, started her own business and made a good life for her son, her mother and herself. And the secondary characters were very entertaining. And then we come to Rob. Even knowing what Twyla had been through with her ex he betrayed and hurt her without a second thought. At the same time, he betrayed his girlfriend and allowed her to treat Twyla in a very condescending manner. And he never gave Twyla an explanation or an apology. Twyla deserved better!"
2,NOT SUSAN WIGG'S BEST WORK...,"Susan Wiggs is a great author and I love her historicals, unfortuntely this one did nothing for me. I am so disappointed because I was really looking forward to it. I really like the heroine and her cute little boy. But in a book I have to like the hero or it's a flop to me. The book would have been great but the hero had a girlfriend the whole time and lied about it. I can't stand that. He should have broken up with the girlfriend before sleeping with the heroine. She deserved someone better after what she went through. Also I don't feel the author really resolved the whole girlfriend issue at the end. I am so sorry to give this book a bad review. Read The Charm School by Susan Wiggs. Now that is a masterpiece! Don't judge this author by this lame book."
2,Didn't care for Hero,"If Rob didn't have a girlfriend/fiancee waiting for him then this whole book would have been different. Rob was never completely honest with Twyla. He let her believe that there wasn't anyone else knowing how her ex-husband treated her. I can handle the infidelity and lying in a romance, but only if these issues are discussed and dealt with. In Husband for Hire they are not dealt with. Nothing else is even mentioned in regards to them so it kind of left the impression that there would not be a HEA after all the H/h could not even communicate and deal with things."
3,Its okay,Other stories appealed to me better than this one. Story was ok. Others better than this one. This story does not take away from the excellent writing of Susan Wiggs.
2,Grapes on a Vine,I did not like the movie. I did not like the plot. Someone else may like that type of movie. It was not a good ending to me.
3,Could have been better,The Director gave a great plot and good suspense. However there were to many pieces too the puzzle left out. Too much trying to figure out the hows and whys to what was actually seen. The actors were not good. I truly support Black movies and appreciate the effort involved.SM
4,Great for a Saturday afternoon.,This was a good plot. Not how i thought it was going to end. You can tell its low budget. Love the movie
3,Cute Flip Flop - a little heavy,"I wear an AAAA width. I hoped these flip flops would be narrow enough for me. I would have kept them if they had been. They are cute, but the leather is thick, and the soles are heavy, which made it impossible for me to keep them on my feet. It is difficult to find cute sandals that don't appear orthopedic."
4,Comfortable sole,"Was looking for summer sandals and thought I'd try a pair of these. Ordered tan and it was true to the image on amazon. The sole is fairly comfortable and the sandal itself is lightweight to walk around in. It is true to size but the width is on the narrow side. I usually get the medium widths if possible, so this sandal is quite ""form-fitting"". FYI, if you have narrow feet, the straps may be uncomfortable."
1,I returned these shoes.,One shoe did not fit properly--also didn't think the sole would be comfortable for all day walking.
5,"My Favorite Author, Robert Smith.","I agree with the reviewer from Virginia. All is Swell is not as good as Miracle of Forgetness. However, I do not believe that is the fault of Robert Smith in any way. I think it is his publisher on this project, Deseret Book. Anyway, back to the book... This book is still GREAT! All is Swell should be required reading for future missionaries. It teaches that you have to learn to love the people you serve no matter how bizarre they may be. I love the characters from this book."
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny","If you ever want to sit down and laugh, you need to read this trilogy. They are sooooo FUNNY!! The author has a wonderful way of making small town life seem not so small. The characters are people you know, people that you can relate to. These books are great!"
1,All is Swell has a familiar smell,"Once again, Smith has created as a hero, an inarticulate Mormon young man. This time he's a missionary, leaving the typically atypical mom and dad for his two year mission in Tennessee. Those he encounters are universally physical and mental oddities without a normal human thrown to stabilize the too-thin plot and teen-age dialogue. This should set back missionary work in the Volunteer State by fifty years, if Tennesseeans make the connection.And I am further left to wonder if the red Kool-aid sect behind the Wasatch Front really believes that the rest of the country is populated by this type of characature."
3,Good,"This is a good, solid rock album, heavy on the hooks and the syncopation. It could have benefitted from just a bit of studio changing-up, maybe a subtle effect here and there, and Bill's voice is a bit thin, but these guys do rock! My particular faves are Never The Same, I Know How You Are, and Treasured Island (which has to my ears a frantic Shudder To Think vibe to it). You can tell the guys are trying to stretch their sound to the limits in their minds of what trios can do. Not a ""reach out and grab you"" collection, but solid tunage nontheless."
5,Excellant product,"Easy to install, allows appliance to be moved at will with out damaging the floor, all appliances should be equipped with rollers instread of feet."
1,Provencal Interiors?????,This is a nice book but it does not contain Provencal style interiors! I am not sure how the author came up with that title since anyone who is interested in French country will not find it here. If you are truly looking for Provencal decorating ideas-this is not the book for you. CONFUSED!!!
4,Country French design with American Style,"Ms Phillips book uses country french design with American high quality. This book is not for the faint-of-wallet. The designs are beautiful, but costly. This is not decorating using local flea market finds as the original country french wss multi-use of humble elements. Many of the pieces used in Ms Phillips book look like they came out of a chateau. BUT. This IS country french decor with an American signature which is wonderful. There are 2 reasons I rated 4stars instead of 5: 1)Lots of pictures in this book to convey design concepts-but more would be better 2)Ways to achieve same look at lower total costs would be appreciated."
4,Beautiful photography,I thought the book was beautifully done. It was both informative and artistic. The photographer did an excellent job of capturing the individual atmosphere of each of the rooms.
2,The contrived look stinks of money -- not originality.,The book was a disappointing waste of my money. There is no original thought or style to inform or inspire the reader. The information presented can be found and explored with greater depth in other sources. The biggest fault is that the decoration on most pages is so obviously done by a decorator for wealthy American clients. The references are generic French and certainly not Provencal.
2,These interiors have nothing to do with Provence !,What a disapointment ! None of the interiors presented has anything to do with Provencal or even French style. The book features interiors obviously designed by American decorators for wealthy and non discrimating American clients. Nowhere is to be found the true spirit of the French decoration or the Provencal style. A waste of time and money. Quite insulting for the true French style lover.
1,Sanding Pad Falls Apart,"This is a nicely designed tool with one major flaw. Even with almost no use, the pad has disintegrated and now needs to be replaced. They are expensive to replace and I think Makita should be replacing these defective pads for free. I can not recommend this sander because if the pad were to fail while high speed sanding, it could result in injury or ruined work. I have never seen this on any other brand of hook and loop sander that I own."
1,EXPENSIVE to maintain,Bought this sander because of some tests I read in woodworking magazines. It worked really well for a while. Just used it lightly in a hobby shop. Soon I noticed the hook and loop sandpaper began working off the pad long before the grit was excessively worn. Had to put everything in storage a few years. Now the foam in the sander pad has disintegrated. No big deal-at least until I find out a new pad cost 24 bucks plus shipping. What a rip off!!! I am supposed to keep replacing pads at that price so some executive can have a multimillion dollar salary? I think not!!
5,GLAD IT'S THE AMERICAN VERSION!,Very cute DVD with enough episodes to keep my 3 year old entertained. I am glad this is the American version cause I think the British one is kinda dull and boring. Did not know Jonathan Taylor Thomas of home improvement was the voice of spot. He used to be one of my faves when I was younger haha.
2,Not the Original,"The shows are OK, but I was expecting the original Spot with British actors and saxophone jazz rifts. This has neither; the actors are American, and it sounds like they got a Bee Gees cover band for the music."
1,english language ?,"One wonders if English is the author's second language. The book is a collection of barely-readable jumble that I guess could be caleld a book (it does have pages, after all).As to the content -1. poorly thought out2. writes it off as gospel, which it clearly isn't3. whiny4. not representative of the fan base at all - he tries to write himself off as the fan base, but this couldn't be further from the truth if he tried5. a bunch of non-sequitors leading to a revelation is how most of the book goes. for example, let me make an example. What does 1 + 1 equal? The earth is round. That's how he explains himself.Let anyone who reads this be clear - if you somehow do inexplicably decide to read this 'book', please keep in mind these are the thoughts of a very poor author. Not the so-called ""Red Sox Nation"""
4,Great readingMust read for Sox & Fenway fans.,"I found this publication to be delightful from page one. The author's love of historical Fenway Park, and the significance of it's possible loss to the people of Boston, becomes immediately apparent. Although I have never attended Fenway Park, I could sense it's charm and grace throughout the chapters. This publication is a must read for any Red Sox fan anywhere, which generates an appreciation for not only Fenway, but for those citizens' of Boston, long suffering the Curse of the Bambino!"
1,Not as advertized,"Description states that can holds ""up to 15 pounds"" of charcoal briquettes. This is untrue as the can is not large enough to hold even half of one standard bag of charcoal. What's more the can is thin and arrived misshapen, resulting in a misfitting lid."
3,Ash Can,Can arrived a little bent from not being packaged correct; bent it back myself but still not 100%. Can is smaller then anticipated. But what do you want for a little can.
5,Perfect...,"a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, it was very easy to obtain one of these little ash cans. as most of the backyard BBQ (and fireplace) world uses gas most of the time for convenience, these little metal cans have become harder and harder to find. i am extremely pleased that i could find this little gem, and it is absolutely perfect for disposing of ""used"" charcoal. definitely a good thing to have around, as numerous people have managed to burn their houses down disposing of ashes in a cardboard box."
2,No Lid,Shipped with no lid. So the name itself was wrong. Its too small for anything other than an occasional fire. If you do any sort of heating with wood try to find something a little more durable and a little larger.
5,Can,"I had been looking for a metal can to keep my cats food in. I keep the cat food on the back porch and it seems that not only did my cat like the food but a few rodents did also, so I thought that I better get something the rodents couldn't eat through. This can has done the trick."
3,Small can with lid,"I bought this as a prop for my son's Sesame Street themed birthday party. Initially I wanted to use it as the kid's trash can but when I received it I realized it was far to small for that; I didn't measure before buying it. So I ended up using it for a game instead as ""Oscar's trash toss,"" which it was perfect for. It is a good-looking can, but it's not very durable so I'm not sure how it would hold up as a charcoal can."
5,It Works!,"You put stuff in it....and the stuff stays there! And just in case you are afraid the stuff might come out, it has a lid...and that works too! You put it on, and it covers the can....very nice...very nice indeed!; )"
2,Ash Can,I was disappointed with this item. I bought it to put charcoal in and it is far to small. It will not hold a regular bag of charcoal and the lid does not fit tight. After receiving it I think it is over priced for the size.
3,Steven Raichlen Ash Can Review,"I wasn't using this as an ash can.. I'm using it as part of a magic trick. However.. Though the CAN part seems to be made well.. the lid is a different story.. it doesn't quite fit... and the handle on the lid came loose on one side almost immediately. Since I had to break out the pop rivet gun for the magic part of the ""renovation""... i pop riveted the handle back on... but for it to happen s fast.. and have OTHER reviews say the same thing.. I think the company needs a better solution.PS.. I bought 24 of these from Sears... and more than 25% had the same problem"
2,"Almost, but not quite, useless","I play about 2 dozen different instruments but no strings. I thought I might learn something about bowed strings and purchased this book. It teaches some very basic rudiments of music such as how to read it and gives some very basic information on the instrument but no one, even an accomplished musician, is going to learn much from this book. If you are already a musician, you will learn almost nothing about how to play this particular instrument. If you are not a musician, I don't think you will get enough to learn anything useful.There is one redeeming feature of this book. There is a small quanity of useful information about differing types of strings, their properties and usefulness. Its about 2 paragraphs. It was however, something that might be useful.Save your money and get a more comprehensive tutorial or, better yet, hire a teacher...at least for the first few lessons."
4,So cute and adorable,"Out of all the Electro bands coming out lately one of the bands that always buts a smile on my face is the girl trio W.I.T. Some songs take a few listens to really get into. Once you hit their cover of The Cars ""Just What I Needed"" you will be doing a little dance. So are some of you wondering what W.I.T sings about. It's Love, boys, and boys. ;) If you haven't had enough yet of all this new age electro. Check out Avenue D my other fave NYC band. They will rock your socks and make you need a shower afterwards."
3,Nice Start,"Hm... Electro is rising! I bought this CD to see what Lary Tee prepared trying to overcome his german rival DJ Hell. Not bad I should say. Milissa, Christine and Mandy did a good job. I like track # 2 ""Ooo, I like it"" and #5 ""Just What I Needed +"". Looking forward to their next release.If you want to be aware of the recent electro stars, you may consider getting this CD.Cheers!"
2,Disappointing,"I thought the book was ""oversold"" in a way. From reading the jacket it looked like the ""answer"" to the Berenger Sauniere mystery, to what on earth it was that turned this impoverished rural cure into a wealthy identity. Now, yes, I know we have the sacred geometry, but it's unfinished? Where's the follow-up on the trough near the grove of trees? Where's the follow-up on just what may have actually happened at the focal point of that pentagram? We don't see it. While the anecdotes are interesting, and tragi-comic in some cases, they almost appear out of place? In some parts I felt like I was reading ""The Making of Holy Blood, Holy Grail"""" (which I loved by the way)."
4,A study of the peculiar landscape around Rennes-Le-Chateau,"I don't know what ""A reader from under and over my cap"" is talking about - this book has nothing to do with alien snake creatures. It's about the peculiar landscape around Rennes-Le-Chateau, France, and the significance ancient people put on the area. Very interesting follow up to ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" and ""Messianic Legacy"" (and, I would assume, ""The Holy Place"", but I haven't read that one yet). There is quite a bit of mathematics in the final chapters, but is explained simply, so as not to deter readers with a fear of geometry. Read in 2 days !"
3,12,"it is that the seed of christ was in some way mixed by female descendant with a serpent, snake like, reptilian like alien. Thus arises the mergovians and their plan for a the establishing as country leaders the anti-kingdom of the serpent."
5,Wholesome Family Entertainment,"Swallows & Amazons: The Big Six is a terrific example of the kind of wholesome family entertainment which is no longer available on our television networks or in our video stores. It is based on the children's book of the same name by British author Arthur Ransome, who penned thirteen books in his Swallows & Amazons series."
1,These caster wheels do not spin freely,"I installed these wheels on a 12x12"" scooter board. Before installation they feel like they spin freely even though the wheels are not uniformly on center - they wobble. Once installed these wheels do not track or spin freely. They are complete junk. Do not buy them. These are going right back to Home Depot."
2,Langhorne Slim came up on the slim side.,"This album is okay. It moved me in no direction except the direction of putting in another cd. I wouldn't call the album ""bad"", but it is nothing more than ok."
3,"Decent tubes, but too fuzzy","I bought these for my Sonny Jr. 2 (harmonica amp which I also use for guitar) I had a matched quartet of mediums in it, and wanted something that would distort a bit earlier. I tried these out, and distortion is instant. But it isn't what I would consider harmonic overdrive... it's just hairy fuzz. Not what I like. I put the mediums back in."
1,"Orbit, guaranteed to kill your lawn.","AVOID ORBIT product. Valves began failing within 4 months of very moderate use - 15 mins daily.No visible problem or clogging in valve; they just refuse to work and emit a high pitched whine.This darn thing killed half my plants. By the time i traced the high pitched whine to the valves, the damage from weeks of watering-if-it-feels-like-it had been done.Unless you want to go out every day and watch the product to make sure it';s working, you'd do better off to buy a $5 watering can.Cannot overstate the horribleness of this product."
2,it got worse,"Geez, adding insult to injury, the year-old 4-way ""brass"" 4 way splitter provided with set just snapped in half like it was made of styrofoam. I was simply tightening it, tryiong to fix that lousy valve, and it literally crumbled into 3 pieces. What garbage."
5,These are awesome pocket multi-tools,"This is a great size, most multi-tools are too big to fit comfortably in the pocket. Also, the collection of tools is what I would consider the essential ones for such a tool."
4,Great book for Advent Readings,"This book is not what I thought it would be, but it is a great tool for Advent celebrations. I thought it was going to be a book on how to have fun celebrations for Christmas, like possibly a family tea etc. It is actually a detailed list for daily Advent readings, which is wonderful, too. We already had an Advent reading plan for this year, so we didn't actually go through this one yet. My husband, who is usually overwhelmed with trying to pick out Advent readings for the family, said he will be happy to use this book next Christmas."
5,I like it.,"Good quality, cheap, looks good, comfortable.For the low price I really didn't expect much but was pleasantly surprised. I expected loose stitching and loose threads typical of the cheap drugstore hat but darned if it wasn't very well made of quality materials with no loose stuff falling off. It's nice to know that once in awhile you can still get quality for an affordable price... or any price for that matter."
5,Very pleasedAAAA++++++,"I have a large head, so its hard to get a fit that I can pull down the way I like to wear it. This hat is plenty big, so if you have a pin head, you might not be pleased."
2,cheap,"From the moment I received it, never liked. It is cheap and thin. Regret buying it but at least it wasn't too expensive."
4,Good Hat / colour issues,"I ordered 2 different Enzyme military caps -- olive & camo -- and am considerably pleased with what I got. Having done no small bit of sewing -- mostly outdoor gear -- I am of the opinion that these hats are decently made, which for the price I didn't expect much. I like my camo cap better, but that's mostly because I'm a fan of camo. As for the olive hat, my only issue is that what I received seems lighter in colour than what is pictured here on Amazon. I might exchange this one for a different colour &/or keep shopping for a darker green military cap."
5,Very funny,"This is a very early release by the amazing morning radio show hosts of WFBQ Q95 in Indianapolis. Very funny stuff!!Tracks...1) At The Race2) The Indy Song (Indeed)3) The Old Man4) A Song For Dick5) Vaseline Alley6) A Tribute to Bob & Tom7) My Town Brownsburg8) Lovely Linda9) Big Knockers10) Hemorrhoids11) Just Another Race Song12) Pee Wee on Vacation13) The Indy Car Shuffle14) The Bob & Tom Theme15) The Drinking Song16) Driving Me Crazy17) Two For The Road18) Weathergirl (A La Carlini)19) A.

5,World's Best Praise & Worship Vol. II,I listen to this CD over and over ... never tire of it. The music is awesome. I especially like the first half.I'm planning on giving it as gifts. Well worth the money. You'll love it.
5,They are great!,Item shipped early. Right to my door. Went under my t desk which rolls easily now. Love them!!! Nothing else to say.
4,okay,"These were essentially as described and they were inexpensive. They don't work perfectly for what I purchased them for, but they are okay."
5,Well Made...,I bought 4 of these over a month ago to put under the legs of an very heavy and very old school desk. They handle the weight very easily and make moving the desk around very easy. Since these didn't cost a lot I just leave them under the desk legs.
2,Not for wood floors,These would be useful for lighter furniture on tile or carpet and definitely not on wood floors for heavy furniture. The wheels are very small and with a heavy piece of furniture indent the wood floor as it rolls across it. With the wheels being so small it is very difficult to get over any floor separator and you end up having to lift the furniture over trying to get the mini dolly back under the leg on the other side. This dolly is just too small for moving furniture of any size.
5,Saved my back,Had to move funiture to refinish a floor. For under $5 each these were great investment!
3,not for pool table moving,"4 of these were not able to handle my 750 lb. pool table rolling over 3/4 plywood. The small wheels imprinted in the plywood and one of the 4 casters bent out of shape. Though for smaller jobs they do seem to be made well.To move the pool table, I ended up renting 2 moving dollies and 2 2""x8"" boards under the legs and using my hydraulic car jack to lift the table up on them, each side at a time, after that it was easily rolled on top of some sheets of plywood."
2,not at all what I thought,"Don't know how they measure these things, but this is TINY... I wanted to use it to move around some tall 1/4 barrel sanke kegs. Won't do it due to the small size. If you're looking to move something that will either fit on the tops, or in the recessed section, it should be ok. If you want to use it to move something else, look for something else. I'll probably end up getting a furniture dolly from HF at some point."
2,"Misleading title, beware","This is not a ""How to"" book, despite its title. The advice it presents are few and rather superficial, and mostly bunched into the last few pages.This is more of a descriptive study and self-knowledge guide, with half of the book consisting of various tests and their solutions. Some of these tests are rather instructive, but IMHO they have little to do with the subject of training your chess thought. Of course, doing the excercises will improve your play, so this is not a useless book.This is definitely not for the beginner. You will also need an interest in psychology and the associated jargon to enjoy this book."
3,i used to be a fan,"at first i thought it was awesome, but it has two problems:1. waaaaaay to hard. cmon, no one sees the pages of analysis that the authors give as the answer and the positions are insanely, impractically difficult. it will just make you feel bad about yourself.2. the analysis isnt all that good. check it with an engine and you'll find numerous perpetuals that arent at all, etc.having said that, some of the problems are quite beautiful"
3,Not so great,"Going through sudies will help your play, and this book has that. But there is a lot of dry, strange stuff in here that isn't so practical. I re-wrote this review after my initial enthusiasm for this book waned."
1,Yawn...I'd rather play chess,"If you need a phD in chess psychology, I am sure this is essential reading. If you like playing and studying chess, get chess books instead. In other words, this book is too far removed from chess reality for the VAST majority of players."
1,Poor product.,I could not get the item to work. The workings were sticky and the flapping was not smooth. It never did fly.
1,Garbage. Hard to assamble.,"This took over 2 hours to assemble and never flew. It basically self-destructed within 15 minutes. It has little to no educational value. We learned more about bird flight mechanics at the zoo. All of the wood pieces had to be sanded to fit in the plastic pieces and they provide the sand paper but it's 1 inch by 1.5 inches, we had better luck with a knife."
2,Incorrect Advertising of Size,"This is my third table ordered and it is the same as the other two. Size advertised is completely incorrect. All three of the tables were much smaller than the deminsions given with the product. There are several blemishes on each table. The blemishes I can deal with but the incorrect size is very upsetting. I have not sent them back because the price was relatively low and I do not want to bother paying shipping to return. The tables could have been very nice but it is the size issue. This table especially is for an entrance way and it measures 23"" but shows 36"" in the product description. I will not buy again. The RIGHT thing to do would be to refund a portion of the price I paid."
5,Great find,Got this for my mom for her birthday and she loves it! It arrived a day ahead of the estimated day so I would say we were all happy!
1,faxing part is the worst I have ever used,"Bought 1 in late 2007. Printing and scanning is pretty good. But faxing part is the worst I have ever known. It picks up fax pages 2 to 3 times if you try 10 times. And it has never been successful in faxing more than 4 pages at a time. If I was lucky enough, it scanned 3 to 4 pages even before it sent out 1 page, then it tried to send them over the line and then always failed. And in 3+ years, it received only a couple of pages of fax. Most of time it did not work.It was a terrible, terrible design. HP should have never release this product."
3,Takes forever to start up.,"Fast, versatile and I love the ink cartridges. However, why this printer has to suck down its toner for 3 minutes (I timed it!) every time you start it up is beyond me. This printer uses a lot of juice when it's on, but turning it on and off every time you need it just takes too much time and too much ink."
1,"Prints fast, but poor scanning feature","I like the quality and the speed of the printing, but the scanning feature absolutely stinks. The quality of the scan is great, but it is unreliable to get it to scan and work consistently. At first, the machine was sucking up 2 pages at a time, so there would be a gap in the pages that it would scan (i.e., pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 would come through but missing page 5). This happened a number of times before I had to manually feed it. It seemed like scanning anything over 6 pages was asking too much of it. When I scanned a 8 pages to PDF black, it would not open up in Adobe Reader and the message said, ""There was an error opening this document. The file is damaged and could not be repaired."" However, it would work fine if I scanned only a few documents at a time, but that defeats the purpose of having it. Very unreliable! I don't know much about Canons, but I would certainly stay away from the HP's."
2,Very Frustrated!!,"When it actually prints the way it is supposed to - it creates a very good quality copy. And, it's very handy to have the scanner built in. I rarely use the fax option, since we have another fax machine, and we also scan and fax through our computer more often.BIG PROBLEM - our printer is now printing mirror images of what we want to print all the time!! We didn't do anything to the settings to create this problem, so I'm not sure what is happening. We can't figure out how to fix the problem.....Very frustrating!!!!!"
3,"Supports Win2003, but software bundle is no good","I'm happy that I finally found and affordable All-in-One that supports Windows Server 2003. It seems to work OK. The problem is, you have to go find the drivers in the HP website yourself if you want Win2003. And as of Oct 2007, it was only supported on an earlier version of the drivers (v7). Anyway, might as well visit their website even for the XP drivers... The full software bundle that comes with the printer (CD) is terrible. It forces you to install memory-resident software which made my XP machine not be able to shut down and, worse yet, it could not even find the printer in a network or USB configuration. Had some trouble uninstalling also. Do yourself a favor if you buy this printer and get the basic drivers from the HP website."
2,Prepare for lots of trouble shooting,"First, after spending big $$$s on 2 technology gurus, receiving help from my tech savvy son-in-law and my next door neighbor, I can finally print, copy, and receive and send faxes. The installation process has taken 2 months. Finally, the machine prints, copies, and faxes beautifully. That said, this 73 year-old techidiot just spent 3 hours trying to extract the (EXPENSIVE) inks from the HP 7580 - notwithstanding the instructions ""to pull lightly"". They should have read, ""PUSH DOWN HARD & TUG LIKE CRAZY."" I liked my HP7000, but prepare for lots of trouble shooting if you get the HP 7580. Added stress: If you call for help & get an overseas voice, hang up and try for the Canadian support folks whom you can understand."
4,Works as advertised,"While I haven't used all the advanced features, this printer works well for ater 2 weeks.Networking was key for us, which ruled out the Cannon printers.Using just the drivers from HP's web site I had my wireless Vista laptop printing in about 10mins.I installed the bloated full HP software suite to my XP (media center) network connected destop in 20-30 minutes. The size and intrusiveness of the HP software is why this printer didn't earned 5 stars.Copying works well.All in all I'm pleased with this purchase. I'll be even more pleased if the separate ink cartridges reduce my printing costs. The price from Amazon was great."
4,HP L7580,"I purchased this printer to work with the 2 new Mac laptops that came into my home this year. The 5-year old Canon that I had installed did not easily support printing from the Macs. So far (after about 3 weeks), I am pleased. The setup for the Macs was almost brainless, and from a PC desktop not much more difficult. The print quality is good, it is relatively fast, and the network connection so far works well. If I have a complaint, it is that HP does not provide wireless connectivity down into their reasonably-priced all-in-one printers. However, ethernet is available at the printer location and that works fine (even better actually, considering link speed). I like it and would recommend it if you have similar requirements."
1,Poor Effort At Printer,"This printer was purchased by us as a replacement for an earlier HP printer. After 15 hours on the phone to India we concluded the following: 1. There are no compatible Vista drivers and software even though you can download software from the web site. 2. Color correction was impossible. 3. Support spends a lot of time with you but has no clue how to make this one work. 4. If your time is worth anything stay way, way away from this printer."
2,AIO that wroks...sometimes,"I have had this product since July 2007 and had various results. Bottomline: HP has sent 2 replacements after 16 total manhours on the phone with (English as a second language) tech-support. The scan function works and interacts well with my XP based laptop. The Fax function is good for flatbed but if you need to send multiple pages, not so much; the feeder has caused the printer replacements. The printer is fine for color and b&w;, but print quality is not a big issue for my business. Ink usage is on par with other printer I've used and an low/empty cartridge doesn't stop b&w; printing.Recommendation: Pay the extra for quality business machine for a specific purpose and save yourself the time/ effort of maintaining this one!"
2,Forget it -- won't work right with Vista,Four hours with HP customer support in India with people who are difficult to understand could not get it running with Vista. The computer could not recognize the printer.The third tech support person I spoke to told me to contact the computer company (not HP) because something was wrong with my computer. NOT SO. They could not help with the install to Vista.
1,14 months and died,"This printer did everything it was advertised to do...even lasted beyond the warranty by a couple of months. Remember when HP delivered quality products? If we used it for anything but light use, I might feel differently. What an expensive disappointment."
2,This printer makes my head hurt,"This printer must have been designed by Rube Goldburg. The software is so ineffecient, it takes much longer than it should to scan.Don't even try to duplex scan or copy. The thing is sure to jam up.I could write a lenghty dialog about how I hate this printer, but the best thing to do is don't even buy the thing. You want mine? I'll give it to you."
1,HP 7580 - do your homework,"I spent many hours with HP support chat on this. I reloaded software and went through the setup too many times. Finally I got a replacement printer and a month later the same problem occurred, and I simply gave up on it.Before purchasing, one should search HP support and read the problems others have had with the support procedures and the runarounds one must go through with HP."
1,The worst printer I've ever owned!,"What a nightmare! This is by far one of the worst pieces of office equipment I've ever purchased. It acted up immediately, would not print properly and the software created problem on my OS (Windows XP). I wanted to return it but made the mistake of allowing tech support to talk me into receiving a free replacement set of print heads. That solved the problem temporarily but only ended up delaying me long enough to have my warranty expire, then they wouldn't talk to me. When in use, the printer software would slow my computer down to a standstill and caused crashes regularly. The complications only got worse until I finally uninstalled the software. What a piece of junk and a waste of money!"
2,"Quick printer, everything else is a headache","This printer is great on paper, and actually prints just fine.Scanning and faxing are unbelievably unreliable. 3 out of 4 faxes lock up the entire machine, with paper stuck in the document feeder. Scans frequently lock up the printer and client software. Days after a failed scan, you can try scanning from a different computer and it will still fail even though there is no error on the display and the printer will print. Frequently, the only solution to problems is to pull the power cord, remove any paper jams, start over and cross your fingers.Very, very frustrating machine - DO NOT buy this for demanding users - and by my experience, I would avoid the entire Office Jet Pro line."
1,horrible,"This fax machine/printer/scanner is horrible. Do not buy it! I have a problem every time I try to use it. When faxing or copying, the printer often jams. The machine also tends to eat your original documents, tearing and folding them. Also, this might be because I have a PC and not a Mac, but it is nearly impossible to get this machine to scan a document to your computer. This machine is a piece of crap. Buy something else."
4,Attn: Installing on Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard),"This is a good printer, but Mac users need to be aware: if you are running Leopard (OS X 10.5), the software CD that comes with the printer will NOT install on Leopard. The printer WILL work on Leopard. But you need to go to the HP Web site, click on Software & Driver Downloads, search for the printer. Once you find it, click on Mac OS X, and then download the file called ""HP Officejet Full Feature Software and Drivers - Mac OS X v10.3.9, v10.4 and v10.5."""
4,"Tough Setup, but Works Great","As so many have noted, this was really tough setting up. Though, in all fairness, some of it was me doing boneheaded things that I only realized were so boneheaded later. Some of it wasn't, though. The software only loaded completely easily on one of my computers. On two others, it loaded but I got a message saying it hadn't loaded successfully. But, anyway, after several hours of messing with setup, I am not completely happy with this thing. It prints (and does all the other stuff) very well and it is so cool to have it hooked up to my network. So, if you can handle a few hours getting everything setup, I'd recommend this printer in a heartbeat - especially at the price I got it with a rebate at a brick and mortar store about $[...] less than the current (6/27/08) price."
4,HP OOFICEJET PRO L7580,PRINTER WORKS FINE; I HAVE A COMPUTER WITH WINDOWS VISTA; THE PRINTER DID NOT HAVE THE SOFTWARE NEEDED TO WORK WITH VISTA. IT REQUIRED ME TO DOWNLOAD A LARGE FILE FROM HP'S WEBSITE TO GET THE PRINTER OPERATIONAL.I WAS DISSAPOINTED THAT HP DID NOT SHIP THIS WITH THE PRODUCT.
1,Don't buy HP All in Ones on Windows,"The software that comes with these devices is excessive garbage. The whole setup is basically designed to sell more ink. Our printer gets into a mood where it constantly resets itself whenever you try to print with less than 10% of ink remaining. It whirs and grinds for about 3 minutes, then flashes on and off. All of this is a result of the feeble software it comes with- it takes ages to install, a sure sign that it is doing too much.I took a similar HP all in one and plugged it into my Mac Pro desktop, never letting an HP CD near the machine. It brought up a little picture of the printer and just worked.If you put the Windows CD in, even on XP, it's the beginning of the end for you. Don't buy one of these things. I'm going back to my Xerox scanner and Samsung color laser printer. They might not be ""all in one"", but they work flawlessly."
5,STRONG SEQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC! EARLY VINCENT PRICE HORROR ROLE!,I am a big fan of Universal's Invisible Man films and they are too often overlooked. The production values and acting are far superior to the later Frankenstein and Mummy features of the 40's. While those films are a lot of fun the Invisible Man series is pretty smart and the FX were way ahead of their time. This is the first sequel to Invisible Man and I think in many ways on par with the original. At the very least it's very entertaining. This is available on DVD as part of the Invisible Man Legacy Collection along with 4 other films about invisiblity. The transfers are very good and there are some interesting extras included on the set. This is not to be passed up. I rate it 4 3/4 Stars.
4,Vincent Price's Voice,"I usually enjoy the Universal Horror Films of the Forties because they are quick, not to be taken seriously, and very entertaining. This film is no exception, and in fact is better than most of them. Vincent Price stars as a man wrongly accused of murder who is injected by his friend John Sutton (a doctor and the brother of the Claude Rains character in the first film) with a serum to make him invisible and able to find the real killer. Nan Grey is Price's girlfriend who helps him along the way. The special effects are good, and the climactic chase between Price and the killer is very well done. Price was a perfect choice for this film, which requires an actor with a great voice, since that is the actor's only asset for most of the film. Price (like the great Claude Rains before him) had an excellent, distinctive voice that he uses to great effect, portraying his descent into madness superbly. This film is a lot of fun to watch."
3,Not quite Faulkner,"The late Larry Brown wrote well, but violently, brutally. This book is dark and painful. In 5 days, Glen comes back from prison and manages to destroy most of the people around him. Book leaves a lot of unanswered questions, such as why was Glen so totally, totally angry, hateful, and incapable of love? As the reader, I wanted more exploration of some of the other characters, such as Bobby and Mary."
5,Simply Brilliant!,"I am honestly not much of a reader, but I had to read this novel for one of my college courses and it was truly excellent! Highly suspenseful and intriguing, Brown gives you just enough to want to keep reading. The relationships are exquisite and the characters, well developed and interesting. I guarantee you won't want to put it town! A definite MUST READ!"
3,The Height of Realism,"I am from the South-- more specifically, from the terrain of which Larry Brown writes. And he has got it dead right. If you want to live and breath rural Mississippi, read this. And all his works. I have met these people. Ate with my feet under their tables. Drank water from their gourd dippers. Set trotlines with them. Seen the lines of hard living in their faces. Larry Brown's characters live and breath on the page. If you like honest writing, treat yourself to this novel!"
4,A Father's day gift,"Not ""Dirty Work"", but having own his two short stories also, I find Father and Son a wonderful read . Larry Brown is one of the few writers that I will always buy and read !"
2,Why does this book get good reviews?,"I bought this book because it received several good reviews. It really must have been a slow month for books. Larry Brown's writing style is poor, at best, maybe even awful, and I can't imagine why anyone would think differently. Check this out: ""He held it in his hand and laid it on the seat of the car and looked at it. He had a full tank of gas in the car, but it was drinking it pretty fast. He didn't know if it was because it had set up for so long or what. He thought about riding over to Puppy's and getting him to look at it, but he was probably working today."" (Pg. 209) If you like that paragraph, you'll like the book, because it doesn't get any better. I kept reading, expecting something interesting to happen, but it didn't. What a waste of time. Brown's style reminds me of Stephen King's: ""print the first draft, editing takes too much time"". I suggest Patrick O'Brian. Or George Carlin."
2,Pretty dang boring,"Best I could tell, beer, coffee and cigarettes were the main characters in this book. One or more of them was mentioned on just about every page. If you want gritty country with some spark and life try Joe R. Lansdale."
2,"Overpriced, cheap construction!","I am a DJ, and I bought these headphones to spin at a few parties because I thought that they looked cool. Although they accomplished that purpose, the sound quality on them is far from spectacular and the construction is CHEAP. The plastic slider broke about a month after i bought them, and the actual earpieces are held in by nothing more than a few low quality plastic tabs. They constantly fall out and hang by no more than a wire, at which point you have to try to stuff it back in. They are also uncomfortable after you wear them for more than 45 minutes.For the price, i would recommend you go for some sony or sennheiser phones. They will sound much better, and last longer."
4,SkullCandy headphones,"These are pretty cool headphones, but are definitely more meant to be a fashion statement than to really provide anything audibly spectacular for the audiophiles out there. Are a bit snug for my 'skull' but it is nothing I don't think a little wearing in could help-provided they don't bust! They come with extra headphone pads so youcan switch color schemes up just a bit. Also came with a nice pouch to keep them in. I like thevolume control dial on the headphone wire that is an independent control of your music player/computer's master volume. These headphones are nice on the eyes, but a little mediocre on the ears. I still love them!"
1,would not recomend,"Other than the cool colors that the headphones have, It Sucks.The cord is way to short, and at full volume they are still low sounding.I got way better performance out of a $20.00 pair of Sony headphones."
4,great head phones,"My daughter got theses head phones for chrismas also but on the other hand she loves theses hp, likes the funky rasta color.sound is good.she is satified with them very much.by the way she is 17 so maybe it's a teen thing"
2,Do Not Buy,"I recently bought and returned these headphones. They may look and feel great, but the sound quality is horrible. The left ear constantly buzzed, and they were not very loud. Do not buy unless they redesign these headphones."
2,Good looking poor sounding,"I recently purchased these headphones and was sorely dissapointed. I bought them because my previous pair of sonys had snapped and it was high time for an upgrade anyway, so i ordered a pair and waited the weak for them to arrive. When they got here i noted the vibrant appearence and creative packaging however once plugged into my ipod I was in for bitter disapointment. The sound quality was far subpar, mathing up unfavorably to my 10 dollar sony mdr-xd100s and even worse the left speaker buzzed uncontrollably, weak. I, after a couple days of use have since returned them and bough a pair of seinheiser hd 280 pros a huge upgrade, hopefully anybody who reads this review will steer clear of the woeful G.I.'s and get a pair of real headphones since these are bassicaly a 60 dollar piece of plastic jewelry"

5,Love 'em!,"These are great! Very comfortable, they wash well and have held up (the elastic). I'm definitely buying more."
4,Old English scratch cover for dark woods. 8oz,"I bought this to use on a dining room table that my kids scratched but it didn't work so well on it, not sure why. I then tried it on an old dark wood dresser & book shelves and it made them look really good!"
1,Complete waste of money,This stuff did nothing for scratches. I shook the bottle and out came this watery brown liquid. Followed the direction and nothing.Don't waste your money
3,Don't expect miracle,"This product makes surface shiny, which in turn can help hide scratch. But it won't either eliminate or completely hide scratches. I would say don't expect a miracle..."
3,It didn't do what I hoped it would,"I bought the scratch cover for dark wood becuase our cherry table had a couple of hairline, really long scratches on it. These scratches are noticeable only when the light hits them just right. After using the product my table looked very shiny and it didn't affect the color of it at all. However, the sratches looked compltely unaffected by this product. This may just be that the scrathes are on the surface, not actually in the wood. It did cover nicely a spot on one of our chairs that was a deeper scratch; it's not nearly as noticeable now."
1,Didn't work for me,"Tried it out on the coffee table, didn't fix light scratches or small nick. Wouldn't even darken the areas. It is almost as if it is too watered down (I did shake the hell out of the bottle) Additionally, after application a clean cloth kept taking brown off long after it should have dried and polished off."
3,Doesn't Cover As Well As I'd Hoped,"I think the ability to cover and adhere depends on the finish on the wood. Some of the scratches covered well. On other scratches, it completely wiped off without penetrating. I was hoping that this was the same formula as the old scratch cover polish available in the 70's, but was disappointed. Definitely hit and miss with this one."
1,Doesn't work,"This product is too light to cover any scratches, and it's the one for dark wood . I used it on furniture and on my wood floors and it did nothing. There isn't enough pigment in the product to cover anything."
2,Blah,Sometimes I wonder who writes some of these reviews for these products?! Is it real customers and users?! Honestly I am disappointed in this old english scratch cover. It cost me about $10.00 dollars and worked as well as a $2.00 furniture polish. all it did was shine my dresser an not one scratch did this dark wood come close to covering! So overall a waste of my money and optimism. Sigh....
3,"Eh, it's only OK","I got this to cover some chewing on our entertainment center from our son's teeth marks. Unfortunately, this did not do the job. It was very messy to deal with so make certain you have a few extra rags. Wipe it down later even when you think it is dry, as it will stain your clothing even a day later.It does, however, work on minor/superficial scratches."
5,Miracle in a bottle,"Looked at several different solutions for revitalizing the wood flooring in the home we just moved into. Years of neglect and too many college age tenants had left the flooring peppered with gouges and lined with many long, deep scratches. Just a quarter of a botlle completely renewed the color of the floor and made the scratches practically vanish. Highly recommend this product!"
2,Waste of money,"Was so looking forward to sprucing up my old dining room table which is a dark cherry finish, but this did nothing. The wood, whatever it is, isn't very porous so I guess I'll have to use a petroleum based stain.Price was exhorbitant! Found it at Target for 4 bucks AFTER I bought it here..... :("
4,good product but buy in store for best price,"I picked this up in a local big box store today for under 5 dollars regular price. Amazon currently has the regular price listed at approximately 15 dollars and selling 40% off for around 9 dollars.As for the product, I'm pretty pleased with it. I had a few different types of scratches on different types of wood and it helped with all of them. It did an ok job on a couple of them and a spectacular job on others. I would recommend that if it doesn't seem like it's working on your scratches, put it on very thick and let it set a few minutes before wiping it off. That really improved the look of a couple of my more stubborn scratches."
5,"If by ""misleading"" you mean ""real""","The flags are real and the book is great. The windhorse design conveys ""the wide-reaching beneficial effects of the Buddha's teachings"". You're actually getting real prayer flags that you might find in Tibet in this package. My only complaint is that 15 is too few. ;)"
3,"Nice Book, Flags Misleading","I purchased this book / flag combination as a gift for a friend of mine. The book is utterly beautiful, with myriad stunning photos and quotes and a description of the history and symbolism of the flags. The flag string is nicely sized and consists of 15 flags. My problem is all of the flag panels are exactly the same, of a ""Windhorse"" design. I would have thought they would have included a variety of different designs and mantras. This fact should certainly be conveyed in the packaging or the description."
3,plastic,"I liked the heat gun but after a year or two of use the plastic around the nozzle melted. I use it for coffee roasting which had the gun blowing into a stainless steel bowl so perhaps the air flow was not typical. If you are going to use the gun in a container that will 'reflect' the air flow, perhaps you would be better served with a gun with less plastic."
2,Not For Paint,The only thing this is good for is shrink tubing. I bought one for stripping paint and found that cheap guns that cost less than one quarter of this gun strips paint better. Its solidly built like all Makita tools but stay away from this if you intend to use it for stripping.
5,Everything's bigger in Texas,"In this tallest of tale tales, Enderle spins a story about some cotton candy that's spun out of control, gumming up the works at the Texas state fair. A great choice to read before a trip to the Midway, or to bring back memories after-the-fact. Be sure to have something sweet on hand while you read -- this book'll make your tummy rumble for a box of caramel corn or a plate of sugar-dusted fried dough. Put on your best twang for maximum read-aloud pleasure."
5,Vik,"Excellent for small chipping ~ 100 square feetMUCH BETTER, than just getting boschammer chipper, which is mostly designed for hammer-drilling, i used those for repairs and they can't even compare to this one..This makita may say less amps, but it's designed primarily for chipping !!It has three attachments one like a needle to crack open a tile and two ""scrapers"", which are great, but for areas more than 10 square feet, GET THE SCRAPER !!! you won't be disappointed.GREAT PRODUCT !---> EDIT: when comparing to boschhammer chipper, I meant those small one's which are more like good hammer drill ones. Those BIGGER boschhammers are like killing machines of war. I just used one yesterday to chip up 900 feet. Craazy(but I liked it)"
2,Weird Makita experience!,"We have purchased 8 of these since April of this year. Of the 8 we bought 4 were defective! They broke within 10 minutes out of the box. Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy, but as all you contractors know down time is lost money!!!! And though it's is a great return policy, nobody pays for my lost time and wages. Usually Makita is a great product (though a bit overpriced), in this case they sucked! When it works it is the best chipper of its kind, so we will continue to use them, right now all 8 are working, we will see if they hold up, just be prepared to have to replace some. Buy extras! (LOL! This statement is sponsored by Amazon.... Not really!)"
2,Covers started coming off the first use!,"I liked how these paddles felt, however the rubber pads started peeling off on the first use! I've had to glue all of them back onto the paddles. If not for this, I would have rated these a 5 star."
3,Good beginner set,"This set is very good for beginning players because it has dual sides. One side has bumps raised which gives better control, the other has bumps in which allows for more spin. Both sides have sponge, but I only gave it a 3 because of the net. The clamp hinges for the net is a low quality."
3,wrong product,"I actually received the wrong product. My package only came with two paddles and two balls. I did not contact the company or send it back because I needed it for a birthday party and did not open it until that day. For what it is worth, the paddles and balls where in perfect condition and we used them."
1,A product for a week,"I got this product, as an entry level, hoping to teach my kids to play ping pong. The product arrived as promised, but within a week the rubber cover of all four rackets (the 8 faces) started peeling off. Within two weeks I had to buy a new set."
4,No complaints,Good purchase for the price. This made for a perfect gift under the tree to go with our new table.
2,Wanted to love this book,"I was disappointed with this book. I wanted to love it and have it on my coffee table forever. However, some fo the pages were blank and it just was not what I had hoped. Sad."
1,Defective after 3 days,"The heater worked great in my 3 gallon eclipse for about 3 days or so. It kept my tank right at 78 degrees which is what I set it to. However, after that bad things started to happen. First, the temperature got to be 80, then 82 and then even when I set to heater to 76F, my tank was 85F and the heater was still not shutting off. I thought it was my thermometer, but it wasn't. I'm just glad it didn't get any hotter or my poor betta would have not been in a good shape. I'm sending mine back for a replacement in the hopes that I just got a bad one. Still, it's a pain to ship this stuff back."
2,Didn't they tune this thing?,"I found most of this CD unlistenable because of this harpsichord's horribly bad intonation, reminiscent of a saloon piano in an old Western movie. What ever charm the selection of pieces may have had was destroyed by the wild beating of mis-tuned strings, particularly evident with descending lines. One wonders if the poor instrument was left in the rain just prior to the recording session, or if the instrument was tuned to a mean-tone temperment, after which the keyboard was transposed a semitone. Did no one listen to this recording before releasing it?"
3,"This book is good, but the series is not over.....","This book is similiar to the first of the series book, except the hero, Howard Bell ruins his flying machine, Yam-Yosh changes sexes, Howard goes to earth to find theses weird ""carrier"" aliens, and a mysterious woman has blocked his acess back to earth. That about wraps it up in a nut-shell. Note: it is very hard to find this book. You may wish to look for it ASAP as it becomes increasingly harder to find. Good Reading! Also, the author was supposed to write another book in the series called, ""World of the Night Wind"", but has never printed it. This is strange as it is advertised in the back of this book."
4,"simple concept, very useful","To the non-serious barbecuer, this item probably seems like a silly gimmick. But it is really quite helpful when working over charcoal/charwood. Before I had this ""barbecue hoe"" (a name that just rolls off the tongue) I'd use tongs or whatever else I could find to move my coals around, which was a bit messy. Can't wait 'til next BBQ season to get even more use out of the hoe.UPDATE 7/30/2009: After using the product about a year, the metal hoe broke off the handle. Luckily, a neighbor has a welder and was able to reattach it without much trouble. But don't be surprised if the same thing happens to you."
2,Marred by bad sound,"Through Ms. Tipo's performance of the Mozart concerto is very nice, and the idea of being able to view ongoing formal analysis is good, the sound quality was very poor, with distortion and levelled dynamics. Perhaps I had a faulty DVD, since others praised its sound? It was almost painful to listen to."
2,l'ennui a Salzburg,"manque d'élégance, lourdeur et faible relief en rapport avec une direction peu précise ou le chef parait dirigé par son orchestre..dommage. On pense a ce que ce DVD aurait pu tre avec un Harnoncourt.."
5,Wish I read this book early on,"Having majored in sociology and taken a race course, I wish we had this as a book. It provided so many good sources for information and really made very interesting analyses that I wouldn't have thought of making. Whether you are Black or Jewish, or Black and Jewish, a lot of individuals could really learn from this book. I wish I had stumbled upon it prior to my journey through Judaism; it would have helped prepare me for the attitudes I would come to encounter, and my own feelings in now being Black and Jewish. This should be recommended reading in sociology courses on race, African-American studies courses, and most definitely in Judaic studies curriculum. Would love to see a follow-up of some kind in the near future."
4,She's Superb,"I liked Elvira, than the movies.Though, the second one was Scary.Damon was good in his roles as twins."
3,Elvira's Movie Macabre: Legacy Of Blood / The Devil's Wedding Night (Double Feature),"Elvira's legacy of blood was ok to watch not very likely to capture attention of any horror movie fans and as for The Devil's Wedding Night the copy of the movie is not that clear at all it seems that it was transfer from vhs and as for the movie was good but also seems that it was cut and not uncut version anyway the plot was good enough to enjoy the full movie,will give 3 stars"
3,Not compatible with all DVD-Audio players,Unlike it is stated in the product description this DVD-Audio doesn't work in ALL DVD-Audio players.Unfortunately this DVD-Audio does not work with the player in Third Generation Acura TL.You get a Format error message then the disk ejects.My previously purchased DVD-Audios all worked except this one.Just a heads up to anyone who owns the same vehicle.
5,"NICHOLAS RAY, OPUS 17","***** 1958. Directed by Nicholas Ray. Chicago in the early 30's. A dancer, Cyd Charisse, falls in love with Robert Taylor, the lawyer of the local mob. She persuades him to start a new life. Last masterpiece of Nicholas Ray who pays tribute to all precedent gangsters movies. The dance acts of Cyd Charisse are sublime and Robert Taylor's performance beyond comparison. PARTY GIRL is a film that should be in every movie lover's library. If you own a multi-zone DVD player, you have now the opportunity to buy a zone 2 DVD of PARTY GIRL at Amazon.fr. No bonus features but a superb copy. Indispensable."
3,"Strategies, Techniques, and Approaches to Thinking:Case Studies in Clinical Nursing","This book ask alot questions, but gives no guide for the correct answers. Taking on-line classess, there is no one to check the info you given. The info can be wrong..needs an answer guide."
2,left wanting more,"The content of the book makes for a good study tool, but it needs to be accompanied by a study guide or book where the answers to the questions can be found. I was left wanting to have a way to find the answers without researching several books."
2,"Strategies, Techniques, & Approaches to Thinking","The case studies are those one might actually see in the clinical setting-however, there are no answers. I was frustrated because how am I supposed to know if I have done them correctly. My opinion-not a good learning tool, especially for self-study."
2,Required for nursing school,"This book is not helpful. It aims at having you prioritize nursing care for patients, yet it has no guidance on rational or answer key to check your work. Overall it felt like an afterthought, and caused a lot of unhelpful busy work."
1,STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WORST SELLER I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTER!! I NEVER GOT THE BOOK AND WHEN I E-MAILED THE SELLER, HE/SHE NEVER RESPONDED. THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE YOU... IS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!"
3,Compassion,"For those who find this kit way too easy....some people can not even get out of bed, they are so overweight. These folks would benefit tremendously form something that starts with these exercises. Granted the title of the kit could be reworded....maybe for people who have 100 or more pounds to shed... :)"
1,Inline Skate,The plastic buckle strap broke at the ankle location on the second time we used them. What a bummer for a Christmas present. There is no way to wear them safely without the top strap being fixed and no real way to fix it.
3,Nothing Special,"This book covers a handful of transmitters, recievers, and a fiber optic project or two. Nothing really interesting, and a bit of a let-down."
2,OUTDATED IDEAS,The information is based on the outdated Food Pyramid and not new nutritional guidelines. You keep wondering how the recommendations would change if the authors were aware of the new guidelines. The water consumption info is useful.
3,Lacks the magic of choral Vasks,"I purchased this well-reviewed CD hoping to find more of the beautiful, expressive loveliness of Vasks's Baltic choral faire. It's not here. I love modern Baltic choral music, as much as any music I have ever enjoyed, but that magic is not here. While there are several sections of meaningful expression, mood, and ambience, the peace is too often broken by loud outbursts of mid-20th century, orchestral ugliness - like an angry Shostakovich without the clever tunes. The performance and sound are excellent, and I suspect this music is top drawer as compared with most modern orchestral music, but it's not at all up to par with Vasks's superb choral offerings. See 'Pater Noster' and 'Plainscapes'. I hoped for better."
3,Uncensord and unrated?,"Im looking for dvd or bluray version i remember when this first came out on youtube free it was the first movie to ever do this but im looking for the unrated and uncensord version,i like my movies blunt raw and the way it was ment to be watched.if anyone can tell me if this is uncensord or know where i can find it please tell me."
5,Made for U-tube??,This movie was very cute with some decent acting and a fun plot - I hope to see more like this - it reminded me of Altman'sShort Cuts.
1,Terrible,"I am shocked at all of the 5 star reviews! This book is poorly written-jumps around from different subjects and venues. The author, at most times, seems to look down on his subject matter in an almost snooty way, which to me was very off-putting. It almost seems like he was forced to write a book that he didn't want to write. Don't waste your time. ""Eat This Book"" is MUCH better!"
2,Very Small!,"Beware that this thing is very small (perhaps made for 9"" laptops). I bought it hoping that I would also be able to use it by placing on my lap but its a little bigger than HALF of my 15.6"" laptop and you cannot place it on lap. I'd rather place the warm laptop directly on lap rather than using this tiny thing.I wouldn't use this on table either as my laptop (like all laptops) has little rubbers underneath to lift it up a bit so it does get enough ventilation without any further lift on the table.ONLY on the carpet it can be useful where you may want to avoid dust from going in the vents.I would suggest you to look for dimensions before you buy."
5,Super Cheap & Super Cool(ed),"I love it. It's low tech. It does the job. That about says it all.OK, some people need more information to be convinced, so here is the deal (and golly it is a good deal too!) I have gone through three, count them, three USB powered cooling fans for my laptop. After spending roughly $65 dollars on these one-year-losers, I decided to try out this low-tech option. To my amazement, it works. My lap top stays cooler, and my keyboard is lifted to a more comfortable angle. Sweet.Do not spend your money on anything else. Really. Yes it is smaller than the size of a laptop, but it has always held mine securely, even when lounging on a Sunday morning with my lap desk and in my jammies. It is light weight, requires no power, and is VERY sturdy. If you really want to spend $20-30 on a USB cooler, crystal-filled mat, or gel mat, go right ahead, but you will be wasting some bucks. This is one low-tech gadget that does the job better and cheaper."
1,TINY,This is not big enough to fit under a laptop. It is sooooo small that it becomes functionally useless. Its reasonable to expect a lapdesk to be at least almost as big as the laptop. This cannot be used on your lap. Its sooo small that it does not support the laptop.
1,waste of time and money,"Would work great if laptop was kept in one location. It's too small, flimsy, and hard to use for mobile or laptop use."
2,Too small (RT_M!),"OK, my fault for not reading the description carefully. This item probably is fine for supporting a laptop on a desk. I wanted it to support the laptop on my LAP, and it's no good for that."
3,It's OK,"I am not too happy as I didn't find a fan. This said it was a cooling pad. There is no fan. I read a couple reviews and thought for sure that there was a fan because they said how quiet it was. Well, there is no fan, no wonder it is quiet. Anyway, it's very small and it's hard to put on my lap and there is no fan. It just let's air get under the computer. I n wasn't too impressed. I would rather have a fan that actually cools off the computer. So, it was cheap enough, but I'm going to have to buy another one with a fan. Any suggestions?"
2,Holds the computer but doesnt cool it off!,"This hold my macbook pro nicely and is easy to carry around,....but its doesnt let it cool off for some reason. when i prop it other stuff it does cool off, so i don't know why this doesnt work!"
1,Does not cool my laptop at all,"Dont waste your time, this design is not well made and the laptop tends to bounce when you start to type with this piece underneath it. There is no to little cooling benefits from using this pad. Invest in a laptop cooler with multiple fans"
3,Just OK,Really didn't help cool my laptop as much as I hoped it would. The cooling pad is really small but I decided to try it anyway.
4,Perfect for what I needed,"I wanted a way to elevate my MacBook Pro while it sits on my desk connected to my Cinema Display. Playing games or doing other processor-intensive activities causes the fan in my laptop to really spin up and I know that allowing more airflow around the computer will help keep it cool. This little foam stand is perfect. It's lightweight and holds the laptop up by touching only a few small points on the bottom - allowing maximum airflow. The foam is pretty non-slip, so the laptop easily stays in place where I put it. This is exactly what I wanted - an inexpensive way to prop up the laptop to allow plenty of airflow around it. Great buy."
3,not portable,"Like some piece of leftover packaging material found in your last electronic purchase. Way too small! Made for a small netbook, not a laptop.Pro's - Does what it advertises. Puts laptop in a more ergonomic position and provides ample space to aid in the cooling of your laptop. Works fine in a desktop situation.Con's - Too small. Not effective on your lap, which your laptop is designed for. Not portable, as in you can't pick it and your laptop up as one unit. Does not work well on the couch or bed.Buy if you leave your laptop on a desk 90% of the time. Pass if you need something effective for any other use.Still searching for the right one."
3,Great for the price,"I like it and it does what it's supposed to without fans that are likely to break down and certainly add to the electric bill. However, it does really grip well and the laptop occasionally starts to slide off. The knobs should be covered in rubber or an equivalent that would prevent this."
2,"Good idea, poor design","This product definitely leaves room for air to circulate, and the angle is effective, but the material is defective. My laptop slides right off the slippery surface. It does not work."
5,"Flimsy material, but works well","For this price, you really cannot go wrong if you want a way to lift your laptop just slightly, and get the extra air to flow beneath it. The slight angle it sits at is comfortable for typing, and doesn't seem to add wrist strain (I have used for about a month)."
3,Works Fairly Well,"I have to say when I opened the package, I wasn't expecting much. Then again, for the price, I didn't expect much anyway. The product material is flimsy and can be scratched with a fingernail. That being said, it actually works fairly well. It can't be used alone (i.e. if you are just planning on putting it in your lap and your laptop on it) it has to be set on a hard, flat surface. It keeps my laptop fairly cool, at least it doesn't get as warm as it did before. I wish the ridges on the bottom of the pad were a little higher, they don't seem to give it enough lift to keep it from still getting warm. For the price, it works decently."
2,Its too small for a laptop,"It just too small for a laptop. Sometime when I am moving around my laptop on it, it tends to loose balance and tip off. But its ok for a 10"" notebook."
3,Not worth it,"I paid $6.99 for this ... however, it's just super cheap foam. I realize it's supposed to create air circulation but I wanted it for the ""propping the keyboard into the right place for typing"" aspect of having something underneath. I don't feel this is overly stable for that purpose. When I type - my whole screen shakes.I would have been more impressed if it was made from the same material as the wrist-guard things that people around my office have in front of their keyboards - to promote the proper placement and comfort of your hands while typing. This thing is seriously, no more stable than a fat foam tray at a restaurant."
3,It works,"but I wouldn't pay more than $6 for it. It's just a slightly thicker styrofoam than fast food places use and so it's lightweight & portable. Some would call it flimsy. It is much too small for my 19"" laptop though."
2,not happy,"I don't like this product , the computer does not sit comfortable on the stand and it slides, I had to purchase a new one that holds my laptop."
3,You get what you pay for,"I wanted a cooling stand for my laptop and found this one to seem fairly cheap and rated in a neutral way.I've had this stand for about a few months now and and I have noticed a few things:First, the stand cannot be used on your lap, but of course it doesn't advertise itself to do so so you can't expect it toSecond, if your laptop is somewhat weighty (I have a macbook pro) then the foam will eventually sink and your laptop will begin to slowly fall after time...Again, you really do get what you pay for. Keep in mind that this stand is completely made out of foam (even though it looks like plastic)In the end, it does the job, but I might consider paying extra for a more durable stand"
5,Serves its purpose....,This product does exactly what I need it to do. The laptops get so hot so there is comfort in knowing that this small-angled device is assisting in the life of my laptop....
4,Does what I need it to do,"It's small, but my 15.6"" laptop fits on it with no problem. It's made of dense foam, so it's lightweight. Does exactly what I need it to do, which is raise up my laptop so the air can flow underneath. You can only use this product if your laptop is stationary, like on a table or desk. You can't use it on your lap as it's too small and your laptop will slide around. For the price, it's totally worth it."
2,poor product........,"The product is very little, and very poor quality. Notebooks ara is impractical over 14 inches. The shipment also took longer than normal.Avoid the problems, and find another option, there are other much better."
2,Portable Notebook Cooling Pad. Be careful!,"May have been my own fault. The product I recieved (a piece of foam)cost me $15 by the time I paid shipping and handling. Just put a book under your laptop or go down to Wal Mart or Best Buy and at least you can look at what your buying. There were pictures but the picture I ""thought"" I was looking at was not the item I got. I'll be more careful next time.Stephen SneadPortable Notebook Cooling Pad"
2,Would not repurchase.,"I bought this because my laptop was having serious overheating issues. Not only could I feel the base being extremely hot, it had started to some times turn off randomly due to the overheating. Maybe the laptop was too far gone and this cooling pad was too late a purchase. Regardless, it did not help the case at all. Look elsewhere."
2,get what you pay for,it's really pretty small and just a cheap piece of plastic foam. i may mount it on a larger piece of thin plywood and put padding on the underside to make a bed desk. eh.
5,These are very sturdy!,"I purchased two of these pads last year and both have held up very well. These have significant height on the lift which effectively cools our laptops. Additionally, these are small and very portable. I can easily fit a cooling pad in my laptop bag and pull it out when I use my laptop in a coffee shop or in a client's office. This also helps protect my laptop vents from the gunk and junk that are sometimes on publicly used surfaces.Recently the bf and I went out of state and used the pads to separate and cushion our two laptops in the same laptop bag. Very pleased with this purchase and when/if these wear out, I will definitely purchase more."
5,Simplicity is Key,I'll keep this short and simple. This product is:- Durable- Lightweight- Inexpensive- EffectiveMy laptop doesn't heat up any more at all and the keyboard is now ergnomic. Would recommend to anyone with a laptop.
5,touch typists - you're not alone,"I'm not going to type with my thumbs on a tiny device. I'm not going to use an on-screen non-tactile keyboard for much typing, so my tablet is limited. My little laptop was also difficult. This angle lets me put away the book I was using to prop the it up (or, alternatively, read it)."
2,Does it's job...I guess,"This laptop cooling pad does what it says it will. It lifts the laptop up a marginal amount to allow airflow, the only problem is that it is made of cheap foam. Spend the extra $12 for something made of more durable plastic."
1,Forget it...,My computer slipped right off of this. It isn't worth the inexpensive price you'll pay. Read on and get another product.
1,Don't waste your money.,"I work with my laptop on a stationary desk and my laptop is constantly slipping off of it. The entirety of the product is smooth so the lifts don't grip the laptop and the bottom is subject to slide around on the desk.Honestly, it turned out to be a waste of my money because every few minutes, I had to adjust the computer and reposition it on the pad. It's also pretty cheaply made. $10 turned out to be too much for it.Before I got this product, I elevated my laptop using a sharpie and it actually worked a lot better than this."
2,Okay but could be better,"It gets my computer off my lap, but I wish I had bought one with a fan which hooks to the computer. I did not realize it was made flexible. It keeps it off my lap but it still gets hot."
3,not really good,"I got it today and I wasn't really satisfied with it. It's smaller than I thought--only about half of my laptop's size, and it's not worthy with this price. 10 bucks for a chunk of foam?"
4,works great but.........,"I really wanted only 1 but somehow I ordered 2. I paid 9.99 for each one and thought I was getting a deal at 9.99 however I see the price is now 5.99. That doesnt make me so happy especially since I made the mistake and ordered 2 and paid for 2 for a total of nearly $20. I will give the second one to my brother who does need one. I wont be so quick to order next time. I usually think about these things ahead of time. Other than the price, the item works GREAT and easy to carry where I need to go as it doesnt weigh much at all."
1,poor design,My laptop slips off the stand. Flimsy material. Not as good as the adjustable laptop stand I purchased from another company. I returned this item.
3,"Laptop stand, pad, whatever","Have 17"" laptop. Didn't think hte 'lift laptop pad' would work, but for the price, it does OK for now. May get a nicer/bigger one with a fan later on. It's actually sturdier than it looks, just wish it were a bit wider. In order to fit a 17"" laptop, just set it midway underneath. so far, the computer has not slid off the table, but then again, we don't leave it sitting there, either."
4,Does the job,"This pad is definitely made for using a laptop on a desk or table. It accomplishes its purpose at an affordable price. It is small (approximately 10 or 11"" at the wide end). The only downside is that with my 15"" laptop, centering the pad underneath partially covers the fan opening. Not a huge problem - I manage to work around it. A side note on the seller: In my seller review, I mentioned that one corner of the pad was slightly squashed, probably from packing/shipping. I noted that it wasn't bad enough to warrant return/exchange. About a week after leaving the comment, I received an unsolicited replacement from Handstands. For that alone, they now deserve a 6-star rating."
5,Great little product,"This little rubber mat does the trick. Keeping my laptop vented and I notice that the internal fans barely turn on while I am playing intense video games. Fits on your lap too, but might be a little wobbly with larger laptops."
2,Not Quite The Thing.,"I ordered this laptop cooler first. I am glad it was reasonably priced. However, it was not what I was looking for. It would probably work great with a ""netbook"". For my larger laptop, I found it just did not work. It is too small. If you move the laptop, the pad doesn't move with it. It causes my laptop to wobble if not positioned exactly right. Definately not stable enough."
3,Handstands Cool Lift Portable Notebook Cooling Pad.,"The product came quickly & was packaged well. It was smaller than what I had anticipated. I think only a netbook that is 14 inches would actually fit this well. It works well if laid on a flat surface,but your laptop shifts and slides off the cooling pad if you hold it in your lap or try to use it lying down on your back. I ended up getting some tape to hold my 17inch laptop in place and then i place the laptop with the pad on a large book when i use it just on my lap. It doesn't remove the heat a laptop generates, but lifts up the laptop allowing air to circulate underneath it,keeping the laptop cooler and your lap from burning if you hold your notebook on your lap. I will probably invest in a bigger cooler with a quiet fan later on, but for $10 including shipping fees, it gets the job done."
3,"No bad. A little small for a 17"" laptop","When the laptop is on the block it works well. On my 17"" laptop it was hard to type with the laptop flat on the table. This does help with typing, but it's so small that the laptop is a tad unstable and if you try to move the laptop it falls off the riser block."
4,Great!,"Ive tried a few stands for my laptop, and this, the cheapest option, is the only one which has worked. Its very simple. It simply elevates the back of the laptop to allow the laptops own fan to work.Pros: cheap, it works great on a hard surface.Cons: smaller than laptop base, so not good if the laptop Is on your lap."
3,Did what it says,"My little netbook always gets really hot, so I figured I'd get it a cooling pad of some sort. This one is netbook sized, fit fine, and works perfectly. Now I'm not burning myself every time I touch the VGA port!But the price is awful. All you get is an 11-inch hunk of foam. Seriously? Twenty dollars for something I could make out of stuff that I can find under my bed?Overall, works like a charm, but costs too much."
5,Under-Appreciated,"The first reviewer is quite right about Lachterman's book not getting the attention it deserved. There are two reasons for this of which I am aware: the first is that the library of congress assigned it an ISBN number in the wrong category. The book is a work of philosophy, but it is categorized as history of mathematics. As a result, it languishes in Science Libraries next to dog-eared copies of Euclid's Elements rather than in the philosophy stacks, under modernity, philosophy of. I actually contacted Library of Congress to try to appeal this designation, but needless to say, got nowhere. The other reason for the book having ""fallen stillborn from the press"" is that Lachterman died of throat cancer just a couple of years after publication. I think he was in his late forties, so we lost a great talent just as he was emerging into the awareness of a wider audience (wider than the Penn State community that greatly appreciated him)."
3,Just okay,I bought this for a child with Aspergers who has great fears and anxieties but the dvd is so rapid fire and disjointed at times that we both found it hard to follow. Made me a bit anxious myself
3,A Bit Too British for Me,"I'm intrigued by opera in English because when done well, the immediacy of the words really hit me with more impact than in the original language. But most operas seem to work better in the vernacular they were written in. Eaglen sings an excellent Tosca. She's more at home in the role than I expected. But I really had to give this recording * for Eaglen. It's well recorded, conducted effectively but the general effect seems to lack power. The other soloists do an adequate job. This is not recording I would go back to very often and even sold off my copy."
2,Uninvolving performance,"This is a mediocre recording. The title role, in particular, is poorly serviced by Jane Eaglen, whose performance is dramatically uninvoling and vocally forgettable. There're much better versions of this popular opera in the catalogues."
2,Unclear,"I used this book a semester ago in my probability class and I must say this is one of the worst textbooks I've come across with. There are plenty of exercises in the book and like the reviewer above said, it covers a lot. However, my friends and I all find the explanations are unclear and unhelpful."
4,Quick Ship,The book arrived quickly and the price was great. The cover is a little indented but you get that when you have used books.
4,Great Sound,"Great sound. But I was looking for a cd player that plays MP3 cds. Even though Sony advertises that the unit does, it does not. It will play cds that you create in audio cd mode, not a problem, but no tags only track numbers. The digital tuner works really well. Will play MP3 players through ""line in"" jack in the front of the unit. Easy operation even without the remote."
3,Not as broad in scope as the title would indicate,"In fact, I'm not even sure what they mean by ""A Life In Pictures."" I had hoped to see an in-depth portrayal of her life, but this docu-drama focuses mainly on Christie's psychological issues: haunting dreams she had in her younger years and her famous, mysterious disappearance. The filmmaker uses an interesting technique of telling the story in flashback from two different starting points: Christie in 1962 at the 10th anniversary celebration of her play ""Mousetrap,"" and Christie in 1926 in a psychiatrist's office trying to piece herself together after the disappearance. The flashback events are depicted out of chronological order, so it's a bit confusing at times for those like myself who are unfamiliar with Christie's life.Hardcore Christie fans will likely enjoy this psychological collage, but those wanting an informative essay on Agatha Christie may wish to look elsewhere."
3,"Works, but with issues",Works fine but I had to add my own extension cords. Although the part number is exactly the same as the OEM part the female cord ends were MUCH shorter than the original.Only lasted a couple years and had to replace it again.
1,Have it set up all wrong,"I tried for over 15 minutes to order this item for my husband, picking all the options, trying every button but nothing worked. Left me frustrated."
3,Good but no hardware included,No hardware is included in this product along with that the directions are poor
2,A little disappointed...,"I was rather upset that when my tagua arrived, out of the five slices I ordered only two were intact. The other three were shattered and useless. I'd like a refund for those three, since I can't do a thing with them in their condition and I can't be sure any replacements sent to me would be intact either. There need to be improvements made on the shipping method to ensure they arrive safely and in one piece-perhaps a box or at least a thick cardboard sheet on either side of them in the envelope? In any case, the two that were intact are nice, but I wasn't happy about the three."
5,Karla's Amazing,"Karla Bonoff's 'All My Life' is a wonderful album. If you have never heard of Karla before, have a listen. She wrote the songs and has a beautiful, expressive voice. She should be much more well know."
3,"A good sander, but sq H&L paper is hard to find","I've had this model for 3 plus years although I don't use it all that much. On the plus side: nice size, great finish, have had no problems with it. Dust collection is adequate if not 100%. On the minus side: Square (4.5""x4"") hook and loop sand paper is becoming nearly impossible to find. For this reason alone, I recommend against buying this particular model. If it weren't for that, I'm sure I'd buy it again."
5,Great little bag!,My husband needed a bag that would meet the Allegiant air carryon requirements. This bag worked well and was strong enough to hold whatever he stuffed in it. The only complaint was that the shipping costs were rather high considering the price of the bag.
5,One Of The Best Aaliyah Songs...Went Under The Radar...,"Although not featured on any Aaliyah based album, it was released on two different soundtracks Next Friday and Romeo Must Die; showing it's greatness. Aaliyah delivered the vocals on this one as always and served as one of her best midtempo ballads."
5,This is tha most rarest but best cd singles,"I love this cd, as soon as I got it i couldnt stop listenin to it. Theres also a video on it of come back in one piece, which is off tha chain. Aaliyah looks so pretty in tha video like she always does. I got this cd from another online place because its so rare I could only buy it there. Aaliyah R I P , baby girl u will always be remembered, and theres a special place for u in my heart. 1 Luv Danny"
5,Here come the Sewergrooves!!!,"Simply put, high energy rock 'n roll, in that sweet style and sounds of their friends the Hellacopters, this band will rawk your socks off!.....and lots of that ""i could care less"" attitude, that should be welcomed nowadays, with all the fake stuff that is going around in music today. Tunes like ""Electric"", ""Far away from me"" and the opener ""Yeah"" (Gluecifer comes to mind), will take you to a place that should be very well known byall of us, close to the heart and down to earth.......long live the Sewergrooves!!!!"
3,Useful but somewhat unprofessional,"My ob/gyn office recommends this book on its website, understandably, to cut down on all of the questions the docs and nurses have to field. It is good and comprehensive at a basic level, but ...Two big complaints:1. It seems that the publisher did not proofread this book at all, even with numerous editions. Almost every other page has a typo or two -- very distracting when you're reading about pregnancy over age 35 and then it switches to 55 later in the paragraph.2. The author frequently refers to God's design or God's intentions, which not only undermines his professional/scientific authority, but also is an unwelcome and misplaced intrusion of his beliefs into the reader's (at least this reader's).Also ... is there conflicting information? He recommends an anti-nausea treatment with vitamin B-6 but discourages taking extra vitamin B-6 on its own?"
1,The Week-by-Week Pregnancy Book is much better.,The index is terrible; the author is flippant. Save your money and buy something else.
1,Big difference from other sources,"Being an atheist, I don't really like when people talk about ""God"" and ""God's miracles."" I tried to put aside these type of comments when reading the book. But I also noticed some differences from what I've read online versus what is in this book. Suggesting soft drinks to stay hyrdated when soft drinks are actually diuretic (q 57). Suggesting lying on your back is really no big deal (q 97). But I knew there was a problem when there is a drawing of an ovary attached to a fallopian tube (q 495). I do not recommend this book at all."
5,1st Pregnancy? Look no further.,"This book will answer most any question you can possibly ask about your pregnancy. You know- the one that you either meant to ask the doctor at your last visit or felt it might not be important enough to ask. The book is informative and erudite, yet, is written in lay language that is easy to understand. It is tastefully comical in discussing many of the more sensitive and taboo topics and its approach is suggestive rather than preachy. The organization of the book around a list of questions that each seemed to gain in relevancy at different stages of our pregancy, allowed us to read in fragments without feeling guilty for ""skipping around."" We highly recommend this book for the first time parent(s)."
4,"Very informative, straight forward answers.","This is a very informative book: before, during and after pregnancy! Although the organization of the index is difficult to follow at times, all of the questions I had were answered with straight-forward and thorough responses. I especially found the sections on drugs, prepared childbirth and labor and delivery helpful. It's great to know that such a knowledgeable Dr. is right down the road from me!"
5,EXCELLENT RESOURCE,I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE VERY INFORMATIVE AND HELPFUL DURING MY FIRST PREGNANCY. IT ADDRESSSED EVERY QUESTION/CONCERN I HAD. I FELT THE BOOK WAS ORGANIZED AND EASY TO USE AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY FRIEND.
5,"If you're pregnant, you need this book!","Dr. Thurston is my wife's obstetrician, and recently delivered our first child. He is a terrific doctor. Among his strengths were the rapport he developed with us. He was direct, honest, reassuring, and warm.We had an opportunity to scan the book in his office before it was released, and were so impressed with the way it handled the various subjects at hand that I'm buying it today as a Christmas gift for a pregnant friend. Dr. Thurston's own strengths definitely come through to the reader.We wish we'd had ""1000 Questions"" available to us during our own pregnancy. Make sure you have it for yours."
5,Best Pregnancy Reference Guide Around,"This book isn't necessarily a sit down and read it cover to cover book, although I did just that when I was pregnant with my first child. However, it is extremely helpful in answering several questions I wasn't sure were worth taking up my doctor's time while I was at my OB appointment and it saved me several calls to my doctor about what medicines I could and shouldn't take while pregnant. It is candid about several misconceived ideas that well-intentioned people pass around to pregnant woman. It has a great index in the back so you can go right to the questions you are looking for answers to."
5,Great Read!,"This was my first John Farris book and I was really surprized at how interesting it was. Without giving anything away, I could not believe how well he wrapped up so many plot twists at the end. If you like Dean Koontz or books like that, you will love this book."
2,Not One Of His Best!,"I've been a big fan of John Farris from when he published his first novel -- Harrsion High --while (I believe) he was still a high school student. To me, his best works are The Fury and Sharp Practice. For about the first third of Dragonfly, I thought this book was going to rival his best. However, the last two-thirds became predictable and unrealistic. Farris' depiction of the women in this book are love-starved, easily conned, defenseless and in desparate need of a man's attention. For this male reader, these characters were poorly developed and it seemed more like a Harlequin romance novel than a thriller. While Farris tried hard to create suspense and surprises in Dragonfly, he didn't succeed as far as I'm concerned. Hopefully, Farris will recapture his ability to create edge-of-the-seat suspense, strong plots and credible characters. I'll be looking forward to the return of the ""old"" Farris in his future books."
2,Beware schitzophrenia..........,"If you like the first few pages read somewhere in the middle before you buy the book. I picked it up from the library based on what I expected to be an economically written thriller (first hundred pages or so) and found myself in such a confused zoo (characters, writing, and plot) that I cannot believe the same person wrote both parts unless there was some tragic event in his life about page 100 or the deadline situation became so desperate that anything would do. I believe the last part of the book is ""southern gothic"" of which I know nothing (based on this example everyone goes hysterical, guilty and stupid) so this is not saying you won't like it, just be warned if you are looking for a thriller or a coherently written book."
4,love these,"these are great for the price! i bought these in place of gold earrings, and they look good, i have had them for a while and wear them frequently, and the gold plate has not yet chipped, scratched off or anything. they look like real gold earrings. the only thing that bugs me about them is that they are kinda hard to put on because the part that goes threw your ear is loose (came that way) and they dont stick out, they just flop down so you have to hold the tiny part and put it threw your ear. other than that these are great hoops! (perfect size for me too)"
5,A horror in deft kicks,"The information will stamp you to death. And there's tons of astronomy in there, as well. Bloody, y'know."
2,i don't speak so good,"London Fields? Probably one of the best books i've read. The Information, the best I can say about it is that it should be required reading for anyone about to take the SATs. Amis pulls words from thin air, many of which I wasn't able to find in my Webster's Collegiate. Obviously he's well read but Jesus, what does schadenfreude mean?"
2,Genius consumed by the same cultural rot he describes,"Martin Amis has talent to burn, but why spend it in a bonfire like this? The Rachel Papers was funny, shrewd, brilliant, and London Fields deserved to win the Booker, but Amis seems to have entered a tailspin. Time has shown that his satirization of money and fame was indicative of a fascination that is neither objective nor indeed properly critical. Perhaps he was trying to exorcise his own demons? Unfortunately the demons seem set to finish him off as a writer for good, which is a tragedy, because he could have been one of the greats."
1,"""The Information"" - Painful and tedious",In all my years of reading books this is the first time that I have felt compelled to destroy a book once I have read it to avoid inflicting the torment of its pages upon another family member or friend.This is one of those book that at every page turn you expect the book to come alive and at the end you question why anyone would have spent so long on a piece of work in which nothing actually happens. Then you question your own sanity for persevering for so long.I have never read another Martin Amis book but still urge everyone to read 'Lucky Jim' written by the clearly more gifted father of Martin Amis.
2,Ultimately tiresome and disappointing,"Martin Amis is a very talented writer. He just needs to find something worth writing about. This lengthy saga of a failed writer isn't it. When writers start writing about being a writer, this is almost always a bad sign. Better to reread ""Money."""
3,Well written but ultimately hollow,"I am still surprised that I did not like this book more. The plot was involving and interesting. The whole debate over successful, poorly written novels and undiscovered, well-written novels definitely held my interest. The male competition and the pure egotism of the main character also played as captivating drama. The cynicism oozes from every well concocted line. Even so, this book lacked something that I am still having a hard time pinning down. Perhaps, it was too well written. I found myself disliking the author because of how pompously he writes. Yes, Mr. Amis I know that you come from a literary family, that you are a brilliant writer, and that you have memorized the dictionary. Even so, is there a need to go to such drastic lengths with your prose. Sometimes, I get the feeling that Mr. Amis is trying to create the next Ulysses..."
4,Amis as accessible and baffling...,"""For humans, the history of cosmology is the history of increasing humiliation."" Amis' universe constantly humiliates me, for he is a writer of immense gifts. Unfortunately, sometimes I can't follow him along those barely-trodden paths because the technique stomps all over his humour. That doesn't happen here.He packs in big ideas and a flurry of big words (my favourite: uxorious) around a story of a writer's jealousy for his best friends success. The eternal debate over the merits of art and commerce are perfectly symbolized in the antagonistic friendship between Richard Tull (whose hyper-complex novels induce migraine headaches in all who dare read its pages) and Gwyn Barry (who shares the same rung in the literary canon with 'Dave' Barry). Don't worry friends, there's no easy answer here. You get to hate both men! And it's funny, too!Also, check out the cool 'Simpsons' reference."
3,"Stylisticly Perfect, but. . .","This book should be looked at more as a series of self-sufficent paragraphs than a traditional novel. Amis is good. How many other modern writers can (or attempt to) maintain this level of basic sarcasim against life while somehow fitting in cute blurbs on the relationship between the protagonist's nicatine stained head and the pulsars and quasars spining throughout the galaxy. Yet, even so. . .I know we are not supposed to expect writers to have anything enlightening to suprise us with anymore, but I just can't get past the sense of harmony I have felt after completing a Tolstoy or even Voltaire."
3,So so,"I really liked the excerpt from THE INFORMATION published in the ""New Yorker,"" and after reading that, I went out and got the book itself. I should have left well-enough alone. The book itself is a grind. And Amis injecting autobiographical passages in the midst of what is supposed to be a FICTION novel is egomaniacal and distracting (Amis would excuse it as ""post-modern""). We go from fictional characters' lives to Amis complaining to the reader how he regrets always having been short. Save your little-man complex platitudes for your memoirs, Martin. To anyone tempted to read THE INFORMATION, read the ""New Yorker"" excerpt instead (or first, anyway). The excerpt was in an issue published in early 1995 (get it at your library). Too bad the ""New Yorker"" editors, who edited the junk out of the excerpted bit, didn't edit the whole novel."
4,My favorite 3 Martin Amis books are...,"...Success, The Rachel Papers, and The Information. I tell you this so that you may choose these and read them yourself. Once you've read them, and Money, and attempted to kill off a fellow competitor, you can read Kinglsey Amis as well. Then, you will play tennis and live happily ever after..."
2,Left me feeling empty,"Martin Amis is not what you would call a ""generous"" writer. Talented, perhaps. Witty or original, maybe. But not generous. He frequently strings together words and sentences that sparkle and dazzle with their elegance, that sing to the ear in a very satisfying way. But there's just something about his writing that makes me think that he wasn't doing it for us, the readers. He was doing it for himself. There's no emotional connection between author and reader in this book. At the end I was left feeling like I had been made love to by a skilled yet uncaring lover, a narcissist who performs her act not for my pleasure but for the satisfaction of watching herself in the mirror. I want and deserve more than that from a writer. Writing is more than just putting words down on a page, more than just creating characters and plots. Writing is about the relationship between author and reader, and that's what is missing here."
3,Funny and competent,"Richard Tull is a failed intellectual novelist deep in the trenches of middle-aged disillusionment. His friend, Gwyn Barry, is a mediocre novelist rising in the marketplace. Richard has decided, that the only way to mitigate his pain is to f*ck Gwyn up.Martin Amis has concocted a wickedly funny satire; it's a satire of capitalism in the 1990's, of the fakery of the artistic sphere and of narcissism.The book is kind of pitiful at times, and Richards broodings become rather tedious, and Amis has included far too much description of the character Scozzy (I wish there was more between Richard and his wife, those parts were good) but, never the less, `The Information' is a fairly successful novel. And ironically, it sent Amis into the world of literary celebrity (the world which he clearly despises) upon its publication and changed his career forever. Not great, but probably more interesting than Kingsley's fiction."
2,just say 'no',"I'm sorry I ever started reading this book. The writing is so good that I couldn't stop -- but man . . .Somewhat like the fictional author's fictional readers, my nose started to bleed and most of my goldfish died. You need to be really hard up for a book to read to knowingly choose this one.After much cursing and gnashing of teeth, I finally finished it.Somebody owes me money."
2,tedious,"This was a grind to get through. I hate oblique writing, and, of course, some people equate oblique writing with genius...well, this book has the oblique writing, but not the genius. I like natural writing, a la Tolstoy. Anyway, the story's sort of amusing. But the postmodern injections of Amis' own personal anecdotes (in a FICTION novel!!!) are jarring and out of place. Amis has confessed to egomania, but just because it's there, doesn't mean you have to display it. Some passages in this book are first rate, though. The plot can basically be summed up by Gore Vidal's famous line: ""When a friend succeeds, a little something in me dies."""
4,Brilliant and unflinching,"The Information is a devastating and relentless book. It is at times hard to handle--the world Amis creates is so bleak and fraught with petty envy and manipulation that it's hard not to get overwhelmed by it. That said, it is without question a brilliant work, and though it left me feeling ripped open, I had to admire the talent on display."
4,The Information is a Hoot!,"This book reminds me of something my mother use to tell me: ""You've got a bad attitude, and nothing good can come from that!"" Richard Tull is a miserable, compulsive, obsessive character and his nemesis Gwen is an innane slug. Get'em Richard!"
2,"Nice style, too much bile","I guess Martin Amis set out to write a book that would often be unpleasant to read, depicting a world that is frequently hateful. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's poignant, often it's beautifully written, but finally The Information is just a rant. The strong overtones of racial and gender prejudice and the jolly view of alcoholism also seem to slip across the line from the foibles of an anti-hero to the noisome biases of the author. In the end, Amis loses control of the abundant venom and it poisons his whole book."
1,Stupendously Bad.,"The first 50 pages are funny. All the rest are dead boring. A bitter boring feud between writers that oozes nothing more than senility. After 100 pages this becomes one of the most morose novels I've ever read. You really can't stomach it after a while, it just plainly goes nowhere.A mixture of irrelevance, unfunnyness, and stupidity permeates you. A story about two bad writers written by a bad writer, and in the end who cares? Martin was never profound, clever, or imaginative, he was just funny occasionally and he's not anymore here.Thanks to the internet media this guy's hype has started to fade and people take him for what he is now, a very, very mediocre writer. Neither profound, nor clever, and certainly not imaginative. If you want to plough though 400 pages of garbage about two lesser writers squabbling by all means be my guest."
2,Mimicry,"With this novel, Martin Amis began imitating another current present-day writer: Martin Amis. He really has become almost a parody of himself. Perhaps he knows that he is incapble of receiving a negative review, so he feels he can just ease back and write what only APPEARS to be an important novel. Yes, the book has some bite, but it's ultimately empty: it's bite for the sake of bite alone, with nothing behind it whatsoever. Hopefully, Martin Amis will start being Martin Amis again rather than just a washed-out copy. His best book is ""Money"" and that was ages ago. He had fire in his belly then, had a point to make. Now the whole point is pointlessness itself."
4,good for MIT kids,"MIT kids graduate with a profound sense that the world is and should be a meritocracy. There is always then that horrible moment when they are forced to confront the fact that the best things in life go to the ass-kissers and incompetents with big PR budgets. This book is for them. It is about Richard Tull, a brilliant writer of modern fiction. His books are so great that that they are not only unreadable but actually make readers too ill to finish. He starves while watching his friend Gwyn Barry make millions writing tripe with a sentimental appeal."
4,In Retrospect,"In terms of maturity, ""The Information"" is a more mature work than either ""Money"" or ""London Fields."" This is not to say that it is necessarily a better novel. Just like saying ""The Last Tycoon"" is better than ""The Great Gatsby"" or ""Tender is the Night."" It is tedious in parts,... and difficult to understand for non-artists. My only hope is that Amis writes a sequel to this book. Richard Tull is more sympathetic than Richard III (I hope!) and deserves to be expanded upon. What happens to Richard and 'The Little Magazine' in the new century, assuming Selby didn't get to him."
4,For the holiday shelf,"This is a companion volume to RD'sThe Book of Christmas, with a piney-green jacket to contrast with the other one's deep red. More craft-oriented than its counterpart, it includes DIY projects ranging from cards to toys, plus recipes from James Beard, a section of prayers, essays on such icons of the holiday as Santa, the creche, and the tree, and stories and reminiscences including Selma Lagerlof's ""Legend of the Christmas Rose,"" Valentine Davies's original ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" the complete ""Eloise at Christmastime"" (with Kay Thompson illustrations intact), Laura Ingalls Wilder's ""Mr. Edwards Meets Santa Claus"" from the beloved Little House series, and Lincoln Steffens's ""Miserable Merry Christmas,"" in which he tells of how he got his first pony as a gift. There's a wealth of vintage illustrations, too. These two books should be an annual part of your celebration."
5,Incredible.,"This is a beautiful album. Every song intelligently reaches a climax without having to be abrasively hard or loud. Some of the most powerful parts of the album are the softest and most melodic. Be it the vocals or the words, the layered production, Katatonia's music is able to wake up emotions deep inside of me and send a chill down my spine without the music ever really exploding into a hard climax. And the best part... 3 guitars and 1 bass. \m/"
3,Wrong clips,"Ok so i listened to the sound samples on here, and i was wondering how katatonia could have changed so much. Then i found out those are sound clips from Jack Johnson's ""On and On"" album. However this cd is pretty good although not nearly as good as ""Discouraged ones""."
3,a different kind of progress,"this album seems a lot more experimental than what i'm used to hearing from this band. i'm not thrilled with the jazz influences or Tool (the band) like sensibilities. i realize these may be Katatonia's influences of late, and a lot of folks obviously love it, but the songs don't seem to have as much feeling to them as on previous releases, even after multiple listens. it's not bad, but not remarkable for me either. however, i quite enjoyed their previous, Last Fair Deal Gone Down, and Brave Murder Day/Discouraged Ones remain my favorites."
1,Katatonia should change their name to really bad,"i bought this expecting some wicked tunes like 'road rage' but i found out it was the wrong katatonia i wanted catatonia. i thought viva emptiness didn't sound happy and welsh and i was right. instead i got really grumpy old men singing about silly rubbish - hey guys take a chill pill its like the 21st century get real, no one cares about whatever this is its just like old men with beards who can't get any dates i bet they are all really ugly and smell, i thought Sweeeedish people were supposed to be like good looking but you can just tell these guys are gonna like never get married or have kids and stuff and yeah they suck suck super suck times a billion"
1,It May LOOK Like a Real Pencil,"I don't know where these people get off calling this a pencil! A pencil has to be SHARPENED. This so-called ""pencil"" can't be sharpened, the ""lead"" just comes out automatically. I don't what this world is coming to, first you have computers and now THIS!"
4,good enough = great,"slow to start but does an excellent job of explaining what Winnicott meant by ""good enough"" mothering. I appreciate the author's effort to point out that Winnicott ignored the concept of good-enough fathering, so now I just think ""good-enough parenting."""
3,Linda,"I thought the product would be thicker for the money spent. I have seen this size thickness for $60.00 less. I do believe I am sleeping much better since I bought it, I just don't know if I would buy again without a little more information."
5,great item to replace the kit strap,"this trap is way more comfortable than the standard strap that comes with cameras nowadays. it definitely makes your gear feel a LOT lighter. I had this strap connected to my Canon 40D while I went exploring the tropical rain forest ""El Yunque"" in Puerto Rico a few weeks ago. The quick release buckles are also great for when you need to get rid of the neck stap, but sitll have a little something you can wrap your around your hands."
4,Neck strain buster,I agree with the other reviewers that the camera strap lessens neck strain. I have a Cannon with a heavy lens and sometimes a flash attached. Can comfortably balance the weight for hours. Also great to sling over shoulder. The stock strap is pure junk compared to the Op/Tech. Enjoy taking photos without seeing a chiropractor.
3,Reasonably comfortable and sturdy,"This strap is definitely an improvement over the Nikon strap that came with my D7000. It offers more support and is more comfortable. It's not, however, a highly-padded, high-end strap, nor was I expecting that for the price."
4,Much better than the original strap!,"Although it wasn't quite what I had expected, thinking the width of the strap would have been even wider then it ended up being, as well, the material, although it is made of very good quality, I couldn't give it the full 5 stars. I have now used it on one 3 hour hike and it is most definitely better then the original and it is nice having the quick release snaps on each side, but the fact that the width of this around the neck isn't quite as wide as I thought it would be, as well as the cushiony material that it appears to have in the picture isn't quite the same... it is still a worth while purchase and I am glad to have something more comfortable around my neck."
5,Love it,This is much more comfortable than the strap Canon included with their DSLR's. Can be worn all day with no discomfort.
5,Great upgrade from standard neck strap,I did some research online and a lot of forums raved about op/tech straps so i went ahead and got it. I was not disappointed. It is made from nice material and is much more comfortable than the stock strap
5,HAPPY CUSTOMER!!!,This is a great camera strap!! I use it to hold my Canon EOS 60D camera and it holds well!! I love the camaflouge/nature print on the soft material that fits comfortably around my neck!! It's easily adjustable and makes my Canon 60D feel so much lighter than it actually is!!!
3,Not as comfy as reviews suggest,"I bought this strap specifically to use on a vacation trip. Its on my 5DII. First day i took it with my 70-200 f/4 (non-IS) lens mounted on my 5DII. I hand it around my neck and after a while, my neck started to hurt. I was surprised as i was expecting this strap to mitigate this issue. I chalk it upto the heavier lens/camera combo. Next day i took my 5DII with 35/2 - that's the lightest lens out there right next to nifty-fifty. Wearing my camera around my neck still gives me neck pain BUT i did notice if i wear the camera on my shoulder with camera on the other side, its very comfortable. But in this position, you can only carry the camera and can not actually use it. Thus its fine for carrying the camera with you for a long time this way but not really a ""magic"" solution to hanging the camera around your neck, ready for action, for extended period of time."
3,Needs More,"I'm not a big fan of carrying my heavy DSLR around my neck. But if you get this and join it with the Op Tech Sling Strap, it turns into the best way to carry your DSLR. I recommend the Secure Its too."
5,fantastic,"A super comfy strap. I have gone hours using this strap with no complaints, not to mention, it has a sturdy build."
5,"Great strap, especially for heavy SLRs","I've used these straps for years for prosumer SLRs. They make the load much less tiring, they don't slip, and the quick-release clips are very handy when you want to put the camera in a fairly tight bag or use it on a tripod."
5,A Digital camera must have,I bought this item to replace the original CANON camera strap which came with the camera. This camera strap is very light weight and comfortable. The strap is wide and the material keeps the camera from slipping off your sholder. Perfect for digital or film full body cameras. I walked around all day with my CANON D50 with a 70-200MM F2.8L IS lens (Heavy) and felt very comfortable at the end of the day. Just wish I had bought this light weight strap earlier.
4,OP/TECH USA Pro Strap,"I rated this strap 4 stars because almost everything about it is positive--it grips the shoulder securely when hanging the camera to the side and the slight stretch in the strap minimizes the neck strain when the strap is around the neck, supporting the camera in front of the body. Perhaps it could be rated five stars, but I tend to be conservative in ratings so I gave it four which I consider to be a very good rating."
3,It's alright,"It's OK, not near as comfy as other reviews made it out to be. It is better than my stock Canon one."
5,Better than the Nikon DSLR straps,"I have replaced my Nikon DSLR straps with this one from Op/Tech. I'm also using this on my Nikon 70-200. Comfortable, seems to handle the load well so that a large DSLR and lens are more comfortable to carry."
4,Much better than a stock strap,I use this and the extension components on a full size DLSR. This is much more comfortable than a factory strap and easily removable when using a tripod (Don't want the strap getting hung up)
4,I like this one.,Camera straps tend to be a hit and miss type product--people can use the same strap and have very different results.I have tried a number of different straps and this one works best for me. The product attaches easily to the camera. The fit and build quality are fine and at a competitive price (some really overpriced camera straps out there).
3,OP/TECH USA 1501012 Pro Strap for cameras,"The Neoprene portion of the strap is sharp and irritates my neck, however for the price, it is OK. I'm looking for a different brand to buy now."
2,OP/TECH Pro camera strap,"Item arrived with broken prong on removable plastic clasp of the shoulder pad. Shoulder pad is neophrene with little dots of silicone rubber on the underside to prevent slippage. Strap is barely long enough for a shoulder strap, works but no room to spare on strap length. Cannot comment on the durability because afraid to use shoulder pad with the broken connector...looks like it would distribute weight. For the Amazon price, it is probably worth it but would not buy again and not worth the effort to return."
5,"Really Comfortable, Really a Must","For those pro guys who (like me) would like to use strap on their necks when they feele tired, this would be highly recommended. It unbelievably decrease the pressure on your neck, spin and your whole body. It is comfortable, made of very good quality (reminds me of old made in USA products). This is my second strap from OP/TECH USA and I would thank them for their nice job done. But also guys! be aware it is huge and if you are owning a lowepro Vertex 200 like me and three 2.8 lens you'll eventually have the same of my problem and should plan to purchase the bigger model lowepro 300, I believe. Then as always make yourself ready for spending more money!!!"
3,Wish it could be a little bit longer,"It works, its inexpensive, you get what you pay for, which isn't so bad for a camera strap. I wished the length could be longer, thats pretty much it, I am wishing I chose a different one and maybe it could be at the length I wanted, but for all I know they could all be this length."
5,Very Nice Strap,"This strap is great for my small camera bag and it would probably work well for a larger camera bag or a large camera with lens. The neoprene has give so that it's more comfortable to carry. The little bumps on the inside of the strap are supposed to help to keep it in place, but I'm not sure the neoprene itself wouldn't do that just as well. I haven't used the strap enough to have an opinion. Either way, this strap is well made and does the job."
3,disappointed,"This would not work with my canon g7, strap would not fit through the loop hole. I gave it 3 stars because if it would have fit, I would have liked it."
5,Comfortable to Wear,Purchased this strap before taking trips to Mount Rushmore & Yellowstone. My wife & I both found it to be comfortable to wear while out on walking & hiking trails. I would purchase this strap again.
3,op tech pro strap,"This strap, turned out to be shorter than the Op-Tech strap that I had used for years before it wore out. You have to wear it around your neck instead of curving it around your arm and shoulders. But the strap at its widest is comfortable."
2,Blah,For me this is too stiff and falls off of my shoulder. I went with a Black Rapid and sold this. You get what you pay for.
1,Poor Quality,When I first read about this product I thought it would be great for my photographer boyfriend! He has been asking for a new camera strap as his current one hurts his neck.Upon opening the package I recieved I thought the neck strap looked and felt decent. I gave him this strap about a week ago and he is still complaining about his neck. He says that this strap does not help or cushion the weight of his camera at all. He also says the quality of the strap is not as high quality as he wished.I wish I could get my money back for this product. I really do not like it.
4,Nice alternative to original,"I used this for my new D7000 with 18-200mm and SB-400. It's very comfortable compare to the original Nikon strap. I hope the durability can stand as well, but for less than $13, it's worth the risk. I'll update again if it failed within the year.Overall, it balances well with size and functionality. Sure, there are better neck straps out there but cost substantially more. And it's not too bulky to fit in my small sling bag when I want to travel light. I particularly like the quick release if the strap get into the way when I try to fit in another case. The quick release is also surprisingly strong. In the beginning, I was worry if they might snap off if I pull hard by incident.There is one tiny problem prevent it getting the full 5 stars. I think some other reviewers has mentioned this. I wish the neoprene can extend just a couple of inches to cover the quick release and seam. That area is quite scratchy to bare skin."
4,good strap,"The Op/Tech Pro Camera Strap 3/8"" holds my EOS 7D Canon and attached lens well and reasonably comfortably. The edges could be smoothed as they are a bit chafing to a bare neck, but it is a good product available at a reasonable price."
3,Strap comfort,"The strap is very well made. I will have to modify it some due to a lack of comfort. With a 5Dii and heavy lens, the material on the neck isn't comfortable for extended hikes. I will add a sleeve from an old fleece shirt over the knobs and rough part."
3,"Very interesting track list indeed, but what's the CATCH?","Turns out half the tracks on this 2CD set were mastered in MONO - the first 3 or 4 tracks on disc 1, 'Hurricane fighter dub', 'Haunted house dub' etc. The worst of them all being 'Ignore the machine (special electrode mix)' which as the sleeve notes implied, was recorded down a phone line and thus becomes rather pointless without the channel-hopping lightning effects. Still, most of the remaining tracks are brilliant synth-driven rhythm workouts in the inimitable style of ASF, and a worthwhile addition to your collection."
3,Good book,The story was great but kindle version had FAR too many typos. Made the story much harder to follow! Needs edited.
4,Some good info..,"This book gave me some good information about places to get married. It had a little bit more ""fluff"" that I had to sift through to get the information, but it was useful."
5,VERY CONVINCING,"My fiancée is a huge Vegas fan. He tries to go there once a year with the guys. He gave me this book as a joke, hoping that I might consider Vegas for our nuptials. Well, guess what? I'm thinking about it. Like most people, I think, I have always considered Las Vegas weddings a bit cheesy, but that's all in the past. As the author points out, Vegas stands for fun with glitz and glamour thrown in. Well, I probably won't get married in Vegas (although I now know where to turn for chapel-shopping), but I can certainly see why so many people visit LasVegas again and again."
3,This is a great way to spent a rainy afternoon.,"A gripping tale of a pre-wedding party gone wrong. Things get out of hand when two strippers get in trouble at a stag. The movie was even made better when our man Mr. John Henson graced us with his hanson young mug. This man is a legend of his time. Go watch the film and you'll agree, what a way to spent a rainy day."
5,Good Film; Well executed with strong performances!,"Recently saw STAG and thought it was very well done. Not into the violence, but the strong performances carries it along. Fun to see Taylor Dayne acting, John Henson as the gay character & Lawrence Leritz as the cop at the end of the movie (also have his video Total Stretch!). Great unsual casting!"
2,Stag,The movie was slow and a little boring. Like a B class movie that didnt quite make it... I wanted to see Taylor Dayne... Maybe not her best film and there was no singing either.
2,Quiet but not very much cooling,"I bought this about a week ago and am sad to say I am returning, dont get me wrong its quiet, easy to install, and looks nice,adequete for the average user but not exactly what an overclocker is probably looking for.For overclockers your going to want something with a bit more power thats for sure."
5,Very nice cooler for the money,"I purchases this because I wanted something quiet, effective and not too large. This definitely accomplishes all those for my 7950GT even with the fan speed turned up to just about 1/3. It may struggle with some of the hotter cards but it cools mine very effectively.Installation is a snap, although I did remove the adhesive thermal tape on the ramsinks and used Arctic Silver thermal epoxy instead. It does not appear to report fan speeds very well to my motherboard but this isn't a very big concern and could just be a defect with mine."
4,Nice fan,This is a nice fan for a replacement unit. I have installed it on my ATI Radeon HD 3650 AGP video card. The instructions were easy to follow and installation was pretty easy. This fan it thicker than the original unit so I had to remove the modem that was connected to the adjacent pci slot. I never use the modem anymore anyway so it was not a big loss. The only problem was the power. It came with a standard fan connector to plug into the motherboard or video card but neither of mine had an extra port. I ended up splicing it into a 12v power cord off the power supply. Not ideal but it worked. If you don't have an extra fan connector I suggest buying an adapter cable to make the wiring easier. Here's an exampleComputer Molex 4 Pin Power Supply Y Splitter Cable. The fan has a variable speed controller that you attach to the outside of your PC. The fan is so quiet I just set it for full speed and have left it there.
4,Zalman VGA Cooler,"Great product that attaches easily.Beware. Make very sure your video card can clear the mobo with this baby installed. Mine did not. Not by a long shot. I sucessfully modified the cooler so that it fit, but should have ordered the version with only the top fins.It works as advertized. It blows the stock chiller outta the water. For performance a 10/10. Installation is dificult to judge because every mobo can be different."
1,NOT for X850 Crossfire. Will not fit unless you modify.,This thing just killed my crossfire mastercard. The mounting screw is way too thick that it won't let the two cards sit down on my crossfire set up on asus mvp motherboard. The mounting screw has a pvc washer that also sits directly on top of 2 resistors on X850 mastercard. I didn't realize it had ripped off my resistors until it's too late.
1,Nice Cooler But TOO BIG!,"Zalman website claims this VF-900 fits on the Nvidia 6800 series but does not fit on my MSI 6800 GT! It is so big that it actually drops down to the bottom of where the card slides into the AGP slot. Since there is a pci slot (empty) next to it, this deep heatsink hits and sits on that empty pci slot, thus not allowing the video card to seat in its own AGP slot!! This is on a Dell Dimension 4600."
5,Works better than expected,"I'm running my Radeon HD 4650 as a GPU miner for Bitcoin, I know its not a high end card for it, but its what I have. I would love to get the HD 6990 or the HD 5970 but for now I'll dream. For those that know, GPU mining can put the card under full load and run very very HOT! With the original stock cooler, when my card was mining it would hover ~95c and sometimes spike up to 108c. I'm surprised my card didn't fry on me, but we can attribute that to the fine quality engineering from the good folks at ATI. After replacing the stock VGA cooler with the Zalman VF900-cu, under full load when Bitcoin mining the highest I've seen my card temp get up to is ~60c. Thats a full 30 degrees cooler, and the VF900-cu also has a fan speed controller for if you want maximum cooling or quiet operation. Very happy with this product would definitely recommend if your doing high end GPU intensive work whether gaming or number crunching."
3,I couldn't say its the best,"It has all of the combos and everything, but it doesn't describe enemy weaknesses or anything. It only has a few secrets-one doesn't even work. It doesn't show pictures of the characters...by the way. Just them doing their moves in one picture...the best game guide is Tekken 3-from Bradygames. It has every single picture of every move and the buttons, big and small pictures of the characters, everything. Even has hidden artwork in the back...an awesome index, ways to get your opponent down and keep them down...it is the gameguide of the heavens. Everything you could want, but if you want a Tekken 2 guide, you should check out another one if you're not an experienced player. Sorry i had to rate this a 3 but, im being truthful."
5,Excellent Cookie Sheet,"This cookie sheet is the best I own. The rubberized/silicone handle inserts make it easy to move and remove from the oven. More often, than not, if a recipe says to bake for 9-11 minutes, my baking is perfect at 10 minutes. This may be because my oven is calibrated. The bottoms of cookies are not ""too browned"" because of the dark coating and they are very easy to remove with a nylon pancake turner. Clean up is easy with just dishwashing soap and a cloth. I normally don't put any of my bakeware or pans in the dishwasher."
4,OK,"I have this hanging on the side of my stainless fridge on one of those stainless magnet clips. It reminds me to use this cloth for the stainless and it doesn't get mixed up with the cloths used for other purposes. It's an attractive bright color that calls out to me to wipe smudges. My best experience with any solution for cleaning stainless is something with natural oils in it, like those sold at Williams-Sonoma. It leaves the stainless looking shiny.1/8/13Amazon needs to rework the add-on price program. I see this item is now part of that program yet still sells for around $7 when it should be much lower as an add-on (see prices of other vendors who charge for item (around $2) seperately from shipping."
5,Works great,This cloth is a life saver to get the fingerprints off of my stainless appliances. Use dry or damp-it works.
2,The writing gets very old very quickly.,"This guide disappointed me on our trip to Istanbul. the pictures are good and it does provide a lot of useful information about the kinds of food available and the cultural food habits of the Turks. However, the writing is bad. If you don't mind bad writing, then buy the book. Here's a sample sentence:""The Turkish version of the pizza parlour is a slice of heaven if you're after quick and tasty belly fuel"".On the next page, there is a reference to ""a between meal carbo tweak"" and then later, ""McWhoppers"", These phrases and made-up words get old quickly when you are trying to read more than a page or two at a time.If this doesn't bother you, then by all means, buy this book. If it does, read up by checking out a Turkish cookbook and your guidebook (like LP's Istanbul guide).I think the author was trying to have fun but it gets old quickly. Call me old-fashioned, but I think it is better to keep to words that are in the dictionary."
2,Too operatic!,"If you want the songs of Robert Burns to sound like operatic songs, this collection is fine. If you think they should sound more folk, then you will not like this at all. Not for me!"
4,Excellent!,"Finally! A first person shooter in the Star Trek universe and it is incredibly well made.Klingon Honor Guard takes you from a holodeck mission, to Rura Penthe, and to a Klingon Bird of Prey all with top notch graphics and logical plots.The game play is just like Unreal, so if you are used to those types of games, you will have no problem with this title.While Voyager: Elite Force is much better, this game isn't bad. I highly recommend this game."
3,For Star Trek and/or Ureal fans,"I'm not a star trek fan at all, but I'm a big Unreal fan, and I'm desperate for more. This game uses the Unreal engine pretty effectively and will suffice for a quick fix. Not as spooky or pretty as Unreal, but pretty still and more action, plus integration of video between and during levels. I imagine star trek geeks will find this last charateristic very satisfying. The first few levels are lame, but perservere and game play will improve dramatically. I've gotten about 20-25 fps at the 512 resolution level on my iMac G3/333/Rage Pro."
1,If you hate star trek... then your opinion will remain firm,"Klingon Honor Guard is definately one of the better Star Trek games out there, though that may not be saying much.You play as a warrior in the Klingon academy sent to investigate an assassination attempt on the high chancellor. This sends you throughout the Klingon empire to find the assailant. Along the way you will run into all sorts of areas, most notably several levels on the Rura Penthe prison from Star Trek 6: The Undiscovered Country, and aboard a Klingon Bird of Prey warship.Your weaponary utilizes some recognizable from the Star Trek universe like the disrupter rifle and the Bat'leth, the mighty Klingon sword.In the end this comes together to be a pretty good game, even if you aren't a Trekkie."
5,Great Read!,"I read this book about 2 years ago and was really impressed with it. So, when I found out that she had a follow-up to the book I quickly purchased it again to familiarize myself with the characters. It's a real tear-jerker. Ryan Phillips does a great job of capturing the the inner emotional conflict of Grace and the story is very relatable. I was surprised that Ms. Phillips was so young because she writes like a seasoned veteran. It was a really great read and I eagerly anticipated finishing the follow-up Fall from Grace."
4,a surprise gift,"I received this book as a Christmas gift and at first I was skeptical, having never heard of the book before. Now that I am just about done reading it I must say it was a nice book to read. Good enough that I will look up the author's other books.When you leaf through the book you'll see many old deer camp/deer hunting photographs from the late 1800's - early 1900's. These alone are worth getting the book for. The people in the photos are unknown and so are the photographers. The author took these photographs and arranged them in a way that he wrote a series of stories around them. The author is obviously a hunter and he did his research in depicting deer camps at the turn of the 1800's.If you ever deer hunted or, even better, hunt out of a long time deer camp you will find this to be a good addition to your library. An added bonus for me is that most of the stories take place in the area I live and have a deer camp."
4,Luxury,"Simply one of the finest, most swingin-est albums i've heard in a long time... a fantastic blend of cool style, cocktails and sheer get-up-and-go."
1,nice guys finish last,"not only are they one of the only truly 'fresh' hip-hoppish acts, they're the kind of guys who might have educated the youth instead of making them dumber with every record. as I understand it they're broken up now.. fighting the man was too strenuous and being more artists than politicos they chose to move on with different groups. too bad, and the corporate executives (I'll never buy another Dean Martin record, not that he cares) who chose to cripple these mad, original geniuses have also crippled the souls of all the kids who may never really appreciate the crooners of yesterday. Why do they do that, every single time? A tiny Dean Martin sample and they want either billions in royalties or the death of the record label that dared allow such a record to be produced: no wonder people don't feel guilty for sharing files. Up with leisure suits, down with lawsuits!"
4,This hammer breaks rock.,"I have about 5 cubic meters of various stages of decomposing granite to remove. The spade bit slices through the soft granite like butter. And the point bit eventually breaks hard rock into managable pieces. I started off with a pick & sledge and rate this tool as 200 times easier. Or, for every hour breaking with this hammer, you would need 200 with the pick.The HM1500B accepts standard bits which can be bought at Home Depot. It is a little heavy with the bit in place, but it does the job."
4,Good second in the Heart of the West series.,"I liked Callie and the work she did was wonderful. Joey was a sweetheart and Callie's family was great. Mase however, treated her badly for most of the book. And he was forgiven for using her far to easily. But in the end he turned into a good guy, because of Callie."
4,Wonderful Read!,"This book held my interest throughout and was made more interesting due to the fact that I knew the places he was speaking of in the novel. A delightful time travel book, much easier to follow than The Time Traveler's Wife and the characters seem real and well developed. Loved this book and would recommend it highly! Also, visit the actual Black Point mansion in Lake Geneva, WI., the setting of the book for a marvelous tour!"
1,A waste of my good money,"I liked this story the first time I heard it, that is, when it was presented as the movie Back to the Future. A sadly disappointing knock off, this book offered little in the way of pleasurable reading. And the fact the author would chose to hurt the good name of Clarence Darrow, is outrageous. To reduce a historical figure such as Mr. Darrow into nothing more than a sex toy used to forward a tired plot is just plain wrong."
5,Absorbing and intelligent acting by Jeff Goldblum,POSSIBLE SPOILER AT THE END OF REVIEW: This is an intelligent TV series made very watchable because of Jeff Goldblum. I have no idea why this series didn't take off except to say that Americans are too used to being 'dumbed down' in their entertainment (can you say reality TV?). Watching Goldblum's character struggle with his emotional burdens was heart-wrenching. The ending of the first episode of this series was stunning and still gives me chills. Fine acting in a very under-rated and imaginative series.
2,Weber Performer fails to perform,"I bought the Weber Performer for it's great design and for the convenience of being able to use gas to ignite the charcoal. Unfortunately, after 4 months the 'igniter system' failed so I had to light the grill with matches. I contacted Weber and they gladly sent a replacement igniter. After installing the new igniter, the grill still failed to ignite properly. I tried 3 different propane tanks to see if there was something in the gas supply that created the problem but the igniter failed to work with any of them. There's a design or production flaw somewhere in the gas igniter system. If you purchase this product, plan to have a lot of matches handy."
5,100% Pleased with my Weber,"When I opened the box and saw all of the pieces, I was skeptical that I could assemble the grill. But I did (by myself) without any problems, in about an hour. (And I'm a not-so-handy female, not a macho grill master). This grill is stable, sturdy and well-made. The wheels lock to keep the cart from moving. The ignition feature is a winner. I lit my coals easily and did not have any problems installing the tank. The features I like best are the thermometer, the ample work space, the rack underneath for holding platters, and the charcoal bin. The work platform is an ideal place to put your digital thermometer so you can monitor the temperature of the meat as it cooks under the dome). I purchased the Weber-brand heavy duty cover separately and am contemplating purchasing the Weber rotisserie, which is designed to fit inside this product perfectly."
4,Charcoal+Weber=Awesome,Great Charcoal Grill and the Touch-N-Go Propane Ignition makes life easy while enjoying the best
4,Great simple grill,My girlfriend and I LOVE this grill. It was VERY easy to assemble and is very easy to use. I love the hybrid of a propane starter with charcoal for actual cooking. Nothing is better than the charcoal flavor. The bucket for holding charcoal is very durable and convenient. Also love the charcoal holders so you can distribute the heat without any of the mess/hassle.
5,The Best,"I bought this grill about 20 years ago. It is the best of both worlds (charcoal and gas grills). Do yourself a favor and also get the Weber Bar-B-Cue cookbook. On Amazon, also get the Jack Daniels bar-b-cue cookbook. Between ribs (indirectly cooked with wood chips), chicken (indirectly cooked and sometimes beer can cooked), steak (directly grilled with hardwood coals), salmon, vegetables, and whatever, you will master the art of grilling. I also have a huge smoker grill and a weber gas grill for different tasks, however, you can't be ""the man"" without this grill."
5,Worth the Money,"After using a gas grill for the last 15 years I decided to go back to charcoal, I thought the price was expensive for a charcoal grill but knew I wanted a Webber so I spent the extra money and got the performer. Not often does a product exceed my expectations but this one did. I am willing to bet after using this a week you will NEVER use a gas grill again. This is almost as easy to use as gas and much more versatile. Highly Recommend."
5,The Bet of the Best,"I used charcoal grills for years, then came the gas grill.... We (ME) had to have one... Then 2, then 3... Then finally I had enough of gas...Last year I bought the Weber Charcoal grill with gas igniter (Model 2005)....The convience of gas to get it going, then charcoal to flavor the meat.... as only charcoal can...To me this is the BEST of the BEST...Terry G. SchuttFredericksburg, VA"
1,Poor and Cheap Makover of a Previously Great Grill,"Poor Weber! I'm not sure what Weber keeps thinking, but they keep down grading their grills. This grill is the latest makeover of an exisitng product into something that is cheaper and not as good. They have eliminated the nice stainless steel work area and replaced it with cheap plastic. Additionally, the wire grill baskets for the coals are more like metal boats that don't allow enough air to flow freely around the coals. The gas control is now on the front of the grill and the charcoal bin leans out and is quite flimsy. Additionally the total workspace next to the grill has been reduced.If you can find one of the original Performers prior to the 2005 models, buy one of those...they are awesome and worth the money. This is more like a cheap knock off and not worth the money.Weber Weber Weber...what are you thinking?"
1,"some parts, no service, no grill","I bought this item and it was missing vital parts. After several emails to straighten it out, their advice was to go to a Weber dealer and buy them at my expense. I don't think that was service, but shuffling the buck and not servicing the customer. Shipping it back was expensive and the only pleasure was knowing they have a 100 pound doorstop. I was able to go to Home Depot and they matched the price and even put it together for me at my house. I won't buy large items from Amazon again."
1,Should of Bought a Propane Grill,"The eternal clean flame of propane just can't be matched by cancer causing charcoal . Do as Mr. Hill would do and keep it real, real propane. Also, Ben sucks!"
5,Great Grill.. worth the $$,"We have many Weber grills in our family and the Performer does not disappoint.I especially like the table, it gives you a nice area to prepare food for grilling or to set plates, utensils, etc on. The gas start for the charcoal is great.I highly recommend this or any other Weber, Made in the USA product. Its worth the extra $ to not buy something imported."
5,Best Grill Ever,This grill is an easy 5 stars. I love the thing. I like it so good that when I am not cooking on it I am planning what I will cook next. I love it. I was also a little skeptical about the price. It is worth every penny. I have cooked some delicious meals on this thing. Buy it and you will not regret it. It is very sturdy and easy to put together.
4,great grill,easy to put together. The blue color looks great. The plastic work station (previously was stainless steel) is very sturdy and easy to clean. The grill surface area has plenty of room. We have been using publix greenwise wood charcoal and it lights well with the gas starter. expensive but you pay to have very easy starting without all the smoke from newspapers. 4 out of 5 stars secondary only to cost.
5,Weber Grill Review,"This grill is the ultimate grill to me. I love charcoal grills but not the hassle of lighting them with horrible smelling lighter fluid or slow chimney lighters. The propane starter is JUST RIGHT! You put your charcoals in and light them with the propane starter, and in 5 minutes your charcoals have started to burn. The Weber kettle grill is as fabulous as it has always been. I LOVE my new grill!"
5,Another Weber Classic,"Weber continues to put out great products, and this one is no different. I bulked at first at the price, but gave in to my awe of this grill. The performance is typical Weber - wonderful. Cooks great, plenty of room. Having the table and storage for charcoal is just amazing. Finally, the ability to push a button and light the grill with ease like you would a gas grill, yet still have charcoal is heaven. This grill would be worth the money at twice the cost."
3,2005 Weber Performer Grill 2005 Disappoints,"Purchased a Performer 2005 to replace worn-out 16-year old original Performer. Like the increased height, don't like plastic deck versus stainless steel. Surprised to find gas ignition system now uses small torch/lantern bottles versus the old 1-gal refillable propane tank, but seemed to be a positive change. However, the new gas system leaked and when sufficient torque was applied to shut off gas valve the plastic knob rotated on the valve shaft so I could not turn it back on. Called Weber and they very quickly sent me a new igniter regulator/valve which seems to stop gas flow with reasonable torque. A major improvement to this new gas system would be a shutoff ball/plug valve versus the current rising stem needle valve.All things considered I would rather buy a new ""old"" model Performer versus the ""2005"" model if one were available."
5,"5 stars, from a non believer","When I first saw this grill on a gold box deal, I just could not believe what people wrote about it... everyone seemed to be pleased with it and talked about how awesome it was.I didnt get it that time (it sold out really fast) but this last time when I first saw it I just ordered... why??well the answer is simple:Most of the people I know buy gas grills because they like the idea of NOT WASTING TIME AND EFFORT lighting a charcoal grill. They rather sacrifice the taste that charcoal gives to your meat by using a gas grillSo what happens when you mix the best of both worlds? you get the performer!a charcoal grill that uses propane gas to light the charcoal up.... just AMAZING!I now know why people give this grill 5 stars:its easy to use, very VERY robust design and it performs like no otherSo if you are in the market for a grill, look no further! this is the one you are looking for!Sincerelya former gas grill user =)"
5,Hooray for Hank Willie,"What a delight! A wonderful trip to fantasy land via our hero, Hank-Willie, as he holds on tight to follow his dream.A terrific and fast moving read.Thanks, Sharon Boswell"
3,Breaks after a while.,"I have purchased 2 of these units. Both worked great for about 1 year of using 20 minutes every other day. But both broke at about the same time. The spring mechanism of both units snapped at its connection point. Great idea, poor construction."
5,Mariss Jansons Shines Again,"This is a happy, sparkling concert by one of today's finest conductors. Spectator enthusiasm builds throughout the excellent performance,despite the inclement weather at this outdoor concert, while we, the participating DVD audience, can share in the joy many times over and under much more comfortable circumstances at home."
1,Flawed disk,"I have had great difficulty playing anything new by Kultur. So just a word or warning to anyone purchasing this disk that if you have new equipment that both plays and records, the disk may not play. Kultur disks seem to stop around the third selection. On some of the disks you can go to the select scene option and start at the end of the disk and watch things backward which doesn't work well with say a full length opera. This disk however will not even let you go to the main menu once it stops. I have several bad Kultur disks that I kept thinking it was my equipment's problem. My equipment plays other manufacturer's disks just fine. I returned this one and will never purchase a Kultur product again.What I could see of the concert which was just the first two selections was fabulous. I'm willing to be the rest of the program was great also."
1,Pages fall out,"This notebook has a sleek design and a nice paper quality. However the pages are weakly perforated, causing the pages to fall out very easily. Quite a nuisance."
5,"My buddy, Black n' Red :)","Black n' Red happens to be standard issue in my office. I always preferred the casebound notebooks because most of the notes I take I want to keep and aBlack n' Red Casebound Notebook, Ruled, 8.25 x 11.75 Inches, White, 192 Sheets per Pad (D66174)is what's I use for my 'permanent' notes. For casual note-taking, I don't mind the convenience of a spiral-bound book.I always expect quality and convenience from Black n' Red and this is what I am getting with these notebooks. Another positive: it fits well inside my laptop case.I am happy that my office supplies me with these classy-looking, well-made notebooks."
1,Not Happy,I choose a 1 Star because the item I ordered was a Poly cover and the item received was a Hard Cover.The Poly Cover is the perfect Binder as it is thin and flexible and easy to use. The Hard Cover is cumbersome and too heavy and not easy to use.
5,Wonderful mixture of music and narration,"I have just heard the story, The Lesson of the Land, on our classical radio station. The narrator is not the only thing giving voice and character to the story, though he did a wonderful job. The music draws you in as well. This will be enchanting for adults and children alike. I am purchasing the CD based on the excellence of that track alone. From the other reviews, I am convinced I will not be dissapointed."
1,Horrible,"This machine is horrible. It's very complicated to empty, and dust flies all over the place! My carpet is very light, and for some dumb reason, I decided to empty the filter in the living room. BAD IDEA!! My advice to you if you do decide to buy this piece of junk is to empty the filter outside. And if you have allergies....Wear a mask!!!"
3,Good Vacuum,"Overall, the vacuum is great! However, it would be even better if I was able to purchase a filter when needed. Had I known that the store in which I purchased didn't sell the filters for the vacuum, I probably would not have purchased it. I've been to a number of stores and no one has this filter. Now I have to order it on-line, which is big inconvenience!!"
5,Does what it's supposed to,Looks good and works for Memory stick and MS Pro duo (smaller ones). Little pricey though.
2,Case Could Hold Memory Cards More Securely,Case is nicely made out of aluminum. However the recesses inside the case to hold the individual memory cards do not hold the memory cards securely. Each time I have used my case at least one of the cards was loose and floating around the inside of the case when I opened if after traveling with it. Disappointing considering you could easily be caring several $100 worth of cards...
4,"GoOd, BuT NoT ThEiR BeSt...","I have to admit I really love the Pet Shop Boys, I think their music is great and stuff; however, this concert would have been much easier to enjoy if the sound and picture quality had been improved! The sound quality is not bad but it's diffcult at times to hear Neil Tennant sing, and the picture quality seems unpolished.The concert itself is good, I had never seen Neil interacting with the audience, he even shook hands with many of them! The music is really nice (you can't imagine how much I love ""It's A Sin/I Will Survive"" here!) Although there aren't many songs, you can enjoy this concert easily. The documentary is good (I would've liked Spanish or English subtitles, though). All in all, it's not their best performance, but it's good. Come to Peru, Pet Shop Boys! I'll pick you up at the airport!"
4,Track Listing,"Track Listing1. Yesterday When I Was Mad2. Truck Driver and His Mate3. Se a Vida e4. Hallo Spaceboy5. To Step Aside6. Go West7. The Theatre,8. It's a Sin/I Will Survive9. Discoteca10. Can You Forgive Her?11. Somewhere12. Rent13. Being Boring14. Left to My Own Devices"
2,Awful,This is an embarrassment. Ill continue to purchase their music but Ill have to pass on any future dvd's. This is ridiculous.
3,great set list lame concert,"I 'm a huge PSB fan and was very disappointed by the concert footage, The concert itself was not worth filming. I'm sure actually being at the savoy this performance had some value but watching Neil Tennant smack his hand against his thigh for 90 minutes is an absolute bore especially after seeing Performance their over the top visually and vocally inspired concert. Again it pains to write this but as much as i love them I know when the emperor has no clothes.Check out performance instead."
4,Meow!,"Meow: A Day in the Life of Cats, by Judy Reinen, uses photographs to show how a day in the life of cats resembles our own. This is a great book that appeals to children and cat lovers alike. The story portrays the cats sleeping, eating, bathing, fishing, and doing other human activities. The photographs are vibrant, and the cats are adorable! Meow: A Day in the Life of Cats includes many cats such as a British shorthair, Persian, Burmese, and others. It is an easy read for children and great for the imagination."
5,The Dieter's Prayer Book: Spiritual Power and Daily Encouragement,"At last I have found a daily devoitional that speakes directly to me. Not a day has passed that the message wasn't right on. It has also helped me to see that I am not alone in my struggle, but God is right beside me and all I have to do talk with Him.I would reccomend this book to any one, not just people struggling with weight issues."
4,Take with Morning Coffee,This is an uplifting read. I read it each morning and try to think of what I have read throughout the day. I am glad guilt was left out.I did not give 5 stars because the spacing on the prayers is distracting.
3,Poorly Converted to Kindle,I love the messages in this book. However I am constantly distracted by its poor conversion to a Kindle book... word after word spelled incorrectly... it is a shame.
3,Not what I thought,It is an ok book. Just is not what I thought it would be. I still am using it and I would tell others about it and let them judge for themselves.
4,Quite good. Use as a reference when I need a new prayer.,Good reference for finding just the right prayer. Easy to find a prayer on any situation when you really are at a loss for words.
5,My Prayer Book,Love it Many things mentioned in the book are so true! Have to apply them to myself. The prayers are so uplifting! God is first!
3,Dieters Prayer Book,I liked it. My friends and I always read it at the end of our weight loss club meetings. We feel motivated by it.
4,""" The Dieter's Dailey Prayer Book""","I don't take time to read it like I should. But when I need encouragement, it is there. This book does help and guide me."
1,Keep Looking!,"Remember the saying ""You get what you pay for""............The case & Bow are excellent quality. The Violin at first look appeared to be also........ It's currently in a repair shop. If I had to do it again, I would do a little more research. I guess the purchase price plus the cost of the repair may have been enough to buy one of better quality?"
3,"A good read, inspiring","This book is one of those lazy saturday reads, where you lay outside in a hammock and dream of how to live more simply. This book inspires you to live such a life. However, the inspiration comes from wishing that you could have a life in Maine, free from some of the encumberances of the world around you. Sadly, the reality is that most of us don't have the luxury of living a simple life, confined to our mortgages, buying food from the grocery down the street, and wishing that we weren't caught up in the corporate shackle of consumerism just to live. Most people can't affort property on the coastline, and certainly can't afford to live more simply -- their location, poverty, hand-to-mouth daily struggle leaves them no time to wish for a simpler life. Simply because living more simply sometimes takes money to do so. All in all, a thoughtful book and an inspiration to try..."
5,A Handmade Life,"The book was not as beautiful as the experience. The first time I went I left a feather and stones and couldn't bear to leave, subsequent visits were as powerful but in the way a life is crafted, one builing upon another. Bill is superlative. The book is good but needs to be taken in small portions, savored,it added to my experience. Building a yurt should be done by any awake human. Bill's the only authentic one I know of-the rest, shallow imitations, posers, pretenders, charlatans and just plain not it. Even though I'm sure they are earnest folks."
2,"A shiny, happy book","I browsed through a copy borrowed from a public library. The pages are glossy; the full color pictures are superfluous, and there seems not to be any actual information on yurt building, the ""occupation"" of the author. It is promotional material. Not the worst hypocritical New Age crap, but I think the ""search for simplicity"" should have extended to the creation of the book, which should have been printed on recycled paper with eco-friendly ink, instead of being fancy, glossy, photo-filled, and wasteful. Frankly I think theThe Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Deadby Max Brooks has more to teach about living simply and getting back to basics! ""Remember; no matter how desperate the situation seems, time spent thinking clearly is never time wasted.""' Max Brooks, The Zombie Survival Guide"
2,Poorly written romance,"Although the storyline is fairly interesting, the writing style and grammar seem as if they came from a high-school writing class. Characters appear and take up space for no apparent reason, and the main character has awkward conversations and odd relationships with her students and colleagues. I'm glad I bought it on sale, and didn't pay full price. Spend your money on another book."
4,wonderful but confusing!!!,"hope you know your algebra kiddies, this book has plenty of it, but many helpful insights on how to stop wasting your money on things that do not work, and why, we dug it!! the equasions are kinds confusing though nikki"
5,Really Liked This Book,"I'm only 24, but the first video I ever purchased for myself was a Gary Cooper film, PRIDE OF THE YANKEES. I was 12. I still have the video. I'm not that familiar with a lot of Cooper's films, but he is always cool how he takes bad stuff from villains for most of the film and then in the last 10 minutes, he really gets back. Now that I've seen this book and all the photos and the essays from his daughter, I'll start renting as many Cooper films as I can. His daughter really loved him, you can tell. That is amazing in itself, since I have grown up reading and hearing from the children of celebrities how awful their parents were."
2,"OK, but save your money","Bought this on a whim to add to the other grill accessories in the garage. Didn't really cook the potatoes quicker than before and was tough to clean. It does keep the spuds in place (as long as there aren't more than 4) where you can continue to brush them with melted butter, mmmmmmmm. Be sure to use non-stick spray (found that out the hard way). Save your money - wrap them in foil and throw them on."
2,Not impressed,I am always looking for a gadget for the grill. After a few tries I found the only redeeming quality is that the potato skin is crispier than normal foil wrapped potatoes. This gadget is heading for the yard sale pile.
1,Satisfaction not guaranteed,"There's junk and then there's junk! This thing is a candidate for the Ripoff hall of fame. Potatoes cook unevenly and the skins are burned black due to considerable amount of time needed to make the food halfway edible. Of course, there's no satisfaction guarantee offered to consumers. I'm sure the folks who brought this lousy product to market had to have known it was an impractical and useless product but they just wanted to make a buck."
3,"Cooling works, but velcro would be better",I ended up replacing these tie neck bandanas with velcro fastened ones which are much easier to use.
5,EverCool Bandanas,I have 2 brick layers and a landscaper in my family and they said these have really helped on the hot days.
3,works in a pinch,"It cools for a little while, but found myself switching back and fourth between two of these every half hour, while placing the warmed up one back into the fridge. On the go, it would be annoying to have to carry a cooler around with me to keep them cool."
3,Maybe this is good if you are wearing sweats,"If you are outside in the hot weather and not wearing jeans or don't mind having a drenched forehead, it could be useful, but it just seemed like a soaking wet headband."
1,Waste of money,"The bandana does expand like it says, but it just doesn't keep you cool! Get some lemonade and a hand fan!"
4,"""Fukk The Blood Of Christ"", how can you go wrong with this??","This is the band's fourth studio full-length, and is perhaps the fastest record these guys have put out. While the death metal aspect of this band takes more of a back seat than it did in Necrodaimon Terrorsathan for a more black metal-esque sound, it's still a good record that's worth listening to. Hell, it even comes with a videoclip, so you definitely got to get this."
4,Awesome,"I would recommend both album and band to fans of Behemoth, Morbid Angel, and Mayhem. Great mix of Black Metal and Death Metal."
4,A must to have!!!,"Sorti tout droit des enfers de l'autriche,Belphegor adécidé de prendre le ""bouc"" par les cornes.Cet album est d'une force et d'une rage inou.Riffs déchainéset blastbeats d'une droiture hors du commun combiné à uneexcellente production(enfin!),font de Lucifer Incestus l'undes meilleurs albums que j'ai acheté en 2003.A must to have!!!"
3,Decent Black/Death Metal,"This is my first experience with the highly brutal Belphegor. Belphegor play a hybrid musical style of Black and Death Metal. They play as fast and brutal as any band out there. If you really sit back and listen you will find a bit of melody within the onslaught of violence. A couple of down falls are the lyrics and the noticeable formula to their music. The lyrics are of the more fake and meaningless satanic side. I don't here anything regarding the Religious beliefs of the Church of Satan. I would have to say the replay value is pretty low on this release. While it's entertaining for a few listens, it becomes pretty boring after a while."
4,Great read,"I purchased this because Theodore shared my great-grandmothers maiden name and was from Settefrati Italy as she was. It was easy to see what it must have been like for many immigrants at the turn of the century. The hardships, the bigotry and the hopes for a better life that they were all in search of."
3,ITALIAN AMERICAN,The book gives a good view of the lives of those who came to this country in the early part of the 20th century from rural areas of Italy. The editing could have been a little tighter.
2,Scholarly but foundationally flawed,"An author who claims, 'Christianity is powered by a myth' is not Christian. An author who refuses to consider the scorching criticism of the Jewish prophets of their own nation's sin (and that of other nations) lacks perspective on Judaism. An author who claims ab initio that hostility towards Jews (his main but profoundly inadequate definition of anti-Semitism) is always baseless is not well qualified to analyse the subject.I am sympathetic with Nicholls concern to remedy manifold and extreme Christian evils against the Jews, and the tidal wave of new anti-Semitism in the form of anti-Zionism renders this more urgent. Sadly this analysis and this remedy is of little value other than as a partial description of causes. I fear his emotional abhorrence of the Holocaust has seared his ability to critically handle the subject. This is an understandable, but unjustifiable weakness."
1,I returned the book,The book was not at all what I expected it to be. That is the reason why I send it back.
3,"Great concept, not as great execution","A much-needed book for amateurs, as there is little info out there on star clusters (there are some graduate-level textbooks, but not even many of these). The information is rather disjointed and the pictures could be improved. Many typos...hopefully all will be improved in a 2nd edition. Still has a lot of interesting info not reaily available elsewhere. A nice big hardbound book at a very reasonable price."
5,A VERY INFORMATIVE DETAILED GUIDEBOOK TO OWN ABOUT FASE,"THIS BOOK WAS VERY INFORMATIVE GUIDEBOOK TO READ AND OWN FOR LATER USE WHEN DEALING WITH AN ADOPTED CHILD WHO HAS FETAL ALCOHOL EFFECTS AND WE ARE DEALING WITH SEVERE EMOTIONAL, BEHAVIORIAL AND LEARNNG DISABILITES."
5,Quite Enjoyable,"I really liked the story. I can't really describe what it is about it, but I just felt like turning the pages. Anthony weaves a very good plot and has a great icky bug. I especially liked the just desserts one character got (don't want to reveal too much). Yeah, poetic justice!I did find two things startling though. In two places, he jumps to the future, taking the reader out of the story. One involves hugging his dad. The other is learning that girls get nervous on a first date too. I am surprised his editor let him get away with that! I personally did not mind those two little jumps, but being a writer, I would be crucified by my writer's group for doing something like that!A very good horror story that I highly recommend."
1,This book is cruel!,Not a great book. Story is very clumsy. No suspense. After reading 3/4's of the book I thought I lost my copy & I didn't really care if I found it or not. Skip this book.
1,GOOD IDEA; BAD MANUFACTURING!,"I bought this grill basket for my husband for Father's Day. According to the description, it had everything we were looking for: detachable handle, separate sections for separate cooking, grilled veggies won't fall through, etc. Unfortunately, the basket is so poorly made that the baskets don't open (without a crowbar!) and the handle neither attaches or detatches without a whole lot of muscle. My husband had to get out his tools and try to rebend the whole thing to get it to function. What an over-priced dissappointment!"
1,Should have listened to the negative review,The quality is just terrible.The latches on the compartments are all bent to a different angle (I kid you not).The main handle is welded to a few thin wires. Looks like it will fall off in no time.
3,I expected more from this product,"I purchased this grill basket after reading a very positive review in one of my magazines. I was somewhat disappointed in its performance at least in my first try. I attempted to cook several varieties of vegetables and when I flipped the grill basket, some of the vegetables were able to slip through the cracks and into the flames. Perhaps I cut my vegetable too thin, but I don't think so. Maybe I am not giving the grill basket enough of a chance, but I like things that work for me the first time.I really like grilled vegetables and I was trying to get away from using skewers. I will try this grill basket again with other types of vegetables and try a different cutting pattern and I will try some other items, like fish, to give it a total tryout. Perhaps I can update this information at a later date."
5,Jamie McMurray crew chief series watch,"I was very please with the quality of the watch, I received it quickly, and all transactions were handled professionally."
2,Not really a submarine story,"This book didn't live up to my expectations. The main premise, a tracked submergible, just did not make any sense to me. And the technical inaccuracies were too big to ignore; it is not that easy to arm and detonate a nuclear bomb, or to tap into a fiber-optic cable.I also think that the terrorist sub-plot overpowers the main plot. The end is more coincidental than climactic. Only a small part of the book is actual submarine action. The main character's role was more to tie together the two stories than to lead the plot.Finally I think some of the character development was too elaborate (eg. the gardening terrorist), compared to the almost rushed action. The hotel room scene seemed longer than the final sub battle.""In the tradition of Tom Clancy"" it is not."
2,"""Had More Downs Than Ups""","I can't complain about the plot, but the execution could have been better. First off, even though Cmdr. Brad Mackenzie is headlined as the hero of this book, I felt the story would have been stronger without him. Practically every piece of Mac's dialogue sounded like a classroom lecture at Annapolis. During the obligatory final submarine battle, he was totally useless. In addition, the USS Bowfin's captain kept talking like a hero from a 1930s weekly movie serial.Still, there were some characters I found interesting. Russian Spetsnaz commando Mikhail Borisov and Scots commando Colin Stewart were true warriors. Confident, dedicated to their people, and never afraid to take on any mission. Borisov actually came off as a likable guy, considering he was on the wrong side.While the story had nice plotting, the ending just didn't live up to my expectations."
3,"NOT ""Le Chemin""!","If you are looking for ""Le Chemin,"" this is not it.This is their first, untitled album."
2,A mouse in the earliest stage of development.,"I became a Mouse fan through Autoditaker and Nuin Nuigging and was curious as to how the band sounded in it's earlier days. This, their debut album (I think), lacks the punch of the beforementioned masterpieces. The whole time the CD was playing I was thinking ""ORB""! (Not a bad comparison mind you, think the Orb's first two releases for reference). ""Frosch"" is my favorite track, it sets things to a good start, but the rest are too midtempo with not alot going on in them. I must admit that ""Future Dub"" has a nicely hypnotic rythym. I recommend this only to the die-hard M.O.M. fans who want to collect the band's entire output. There is little on Vulvaland to even hint at the style of present-day Mouse On Mars. If anything this recording shows how much the band has progressed and grown into their own original sound as years have gone by."
5,a bittersweet read,"I found this book entertaining and uplifting, even though it deals with some depressing circumstances. Virginia's portrayal of a girl who found herself ""in trouble"" and remains in trouble is insightful, and I felt that she was truly a real person trying to be a real person. A wonderful book that I felt like re-reading as soon as I finished."
4,Breezy novel - a pleasure to read,"Reading this book, I got to know the narrator well through her words and outlook on the world. She was endearing in her naivete but also exasperating at times. In any case, I was definitely in her corner.The only disappointment was in the all too convenient ""happy ending"". Rarely does life tie up loose ends so tidily."
2,Disappointing,"I had a very hard time with this book. None of the characters were likeable. I lost sympathy for Virginia because she was so passive about everything.The type of the book is so big, and the book itself so short (235 pages) that sometimes I wondered if I was reading a teenybopper novel."
5,great show,"just awesome show,one of best,never saw first season and gonna watch asap! as fitz would say ring a ding ding!"
5,WORKS GREAT,"I BOUGHT THIS DASH MAT TO STOP THE GLARE OFF THE DASH.....WORKS GREAT!!!!THIS IS MY 4TH ""DASHMAT""....MY 4TH CAR WITH IT ON THE DASH!!!!! THE 1ST WAS ALREADY ON IT WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR& HAVE BOUGHT ONE EVERY TIME I GET A CAR!!!!I ALWAYS SHOP ""AMAZON""!!!"
4,Comments about LS 1440 Miter Saw Makita make,I have been using this product since last two and half year. We have got the details from one of Al.Supplier who is using this product.The product is very good functionally and showing the very good performance in the industrial environment. We are using product almost ten hours per day .I am based in India . We are requiring more outlets who can support us more effectively .
1,Makita LS 1440 saw,"My company purchased this saw about a year ago. It does not cut square, and has a handle that is very uncomfortable to use. When making a verticle cut through 4"" material the cut is 1/32"" out from top to bottom."
1,An injustice,"This disk is in a word ""terrible"". I couldn't finsh it. The sound quality is awful. The video is worst. I think that who ever publish this work has done a grave disservice to a legend."
2,Can You Say Medley?,I just watched a PBS version of this concert. Marvin sounded great though I agree the technical quality was poor. I realize this was almost thirty years ago but; I wouldn't pay for this. The main reason: It's one giant medley. Marvin mailed this one in IMHO. I heard three actual complete songs. Stick to the original Tamala and Motown recordings if you need a dose of Marvin. RIP Marvin Gaye.
5,Jim Lee's classic art,"This recopilation shows the gold age of x-men (the 90's) beacuse thanks to Chis Claremont stories and Jim Lee's Strong art, the X-men are the most famous comic book in the world, you can read the first apperance of omega red, and Dr. Cornelius comeback, you must read this if you think you are a x-men fan."
4,Awesome. It's just awesome.,"This volume is great. You have to get it if you love the X-men. This volume contains the first seven or so issues of the X-men series that came out twelve years ago. I loved these stories as a kid and I love them now. They are still just as good as I remember. Issues 1-4 have a really good Magento/X-men battle while Issues 4-7 have a great Wolverine story that carries over into the now classic ""Wolverine#50."" I hope the issues that follow this one (Jim Lee's ""Ghost Rider/X-men/Brood story"" and Jim Lee's ""Longshot"" story) get published in a volume that Accompanies this one."
3,Not the best,"It's heroic, I'll givem thatBut it's boring. It's almost trivial in today's X-menthe art is nothing amazing.It doesnt feel like today's x-men either, like they forgot what theyre fighting for. not very personaldo not recommend"
2,Shadows during the video obstrucing my view...annoying,"I was all set to love this video due to the excellent work I had seen in my previous purchase of the ""Mastering Chair Massage"" video but I ended up getting very frustrated with the Integrative Massage - Earth video.The video was set outdoors under the strong sunlight and many times I found that due to the camera-man's position the massage therapist would end up casting her own shadow over her own hands and I couldn't get a good view of her hand/finger position.I wish I could give this video a better review but the view of the hand stroke positions being obstructed due to the shadows annoyed me greatly."
2,Could be much better,"While this book is better than the Build documentation (pretty much anything could be), I expected more from the officially authorized level editing guide. The book is rife with errors, and some of the step-by-step instructions were obviously never tested because they don't work. (Try tagliaferri's instructions for creating a swinging door - you'll end up with an inoperable mess.) Plus some information is missing, some is buried in odd places, and there's no index, making it difficult to locate things. It's still an OK book, but it could have been much better."
1,Sexist,"I found this book to be geared towards men, especially wanting to escape from their spouse. Very sexist opinions!"
2,The importance of individual rights,"Perhaps the least known protections of my rights as an individual are in the New Hampshire State Constitution: here there is not only an absolute ""Right of Conscience"" (New York waffles a bit) but not only the right, but the obligation to resist oppression! As far as I can tell, every State has its own Consitution (Texas' should be really interesting reading!) and many go further in rights' protection than does the US Constitution, which required a greater consenus to pass. They were some folk, America's Revolutionaries. We are letting them down if we allow our true liberty to be nibbled away by bureaucrats. My most important assets are my time and energy: money can always be replaced (and having no money is actually often better than having a little: among other things, the courts will waive all fees, including service of papers by deputies since justice is supposed to be free!) Happy Hunting!"
2,Worst Book Ever,"I personally found the book uninformative. But should I really be suprised? I don't a book sold at Amazon.com or any other website/bookstore is really going to tell anyone how disappear. In addition to that, I did not enjoy the authors writing style at all. The again I'm used to books by Salinger, Fitzgerald and Heller, not Panaku. In closing, poorly written, uninformative, and unhelpful. If I had any assests to hide, and followed this book, I would not get very far."
2,Dated and not practical for privacy,I have read a number of privacy books and this one is not a great read.Dated and not practical.
1,great fantasy,"If you think it's going to help you in the real world, don't buy it. Great reading but don't run out and hire a private investigator to find your ex's money with his techniques...it just won't happen! This is purely Ian Flemming stuff. Fiction, ""undercover"" of reality. I wonder what he was on when when he wrote this hyper fantasy!"
3,Hide Your Assets and Disappear,Good on ideas on disappearing but I don't want to do that. Securing assests information is okay.
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is for more affluent folks who already have access to this type of information. Outdated, sexist, even insulting to those who believe in paying their fair share. If you are a regular middle class or working class person who is fed up with paying through the nose to make everyone else richer, you are on the right path but this is NOT the book for you."
4,A foundation,"As I read this book, as I do with all informative books, I kept in mind that this is not all inclusive piece of work or a fail-safe means of doing it. So you might ask what it is, well it is a basis for you to start planning. If you plan on doing what the author discuses and don't do more research than just his book then you missed the point of it. Read it, think, read another, think, plan, review, then act. The only axiom that he missed is, ""Plan twice, act once."""
1,Utterly useless,"Before 9/11, this was already a joke among people interested in protecting their privacy and assets (e.g., from litigious lawyers). After 9/11, none of the stuff mentioned in this worthless book even remotely works. BTW, the other reviewers are right: he doesn't really tell you *how* to do things anyway!"
2,"The title promises a lot, but the book doesn't deliver.","Beware of catchy titles. This book covers the topic in a very superficial way. There's really very little new information here that hasn't already been covered by other authors. The title is catchy, and the promotional material sounds enticing, but the book simply doesn't deliver very useful information. If you have already read other books and articles on this subject, you should save your money and and reading time by not purchasing this book. If you know nothing about this topic, then it's a place to start. However, don't expect any eye-popping solutions or revelations."
1,A Fictional Escapist Book,"This is typical of the paranoid presses that publish fantasy escape how to manuals as non-fiction. Once the backwater of sloppy ""publishing companies"" more and more of these books are slipping into the mainstream. This is a prime example from a major publisher. The author takes you on a tour from start to finish on how you can sneak away and never be found. That tour contains no practical information. You can read this and dream about it. You can learn as much as is in this book, or almost any of the invisible disappearing books, by reading ""Learning How To Disappear"" by Frank M. Ahearn which is a free article available on the internet. It is short, incomplete, but free. This book is not as good as that article. Most of these authors hold out an illusion that eager readers are more than willing to accept."
3,Witty and thought provoking.............,This is not a how to book. I'm not sure there is enough time or paper to write a concise how to book on this subject. Just from my read I thought it far more complicated to sever all ties and disappear.It was beyond informative on the intricacy of our goverments financial prowess and technical abilities to track each and everyone of us through the almighty dollar. It was pure scary.It really brought home to me how much power our government has and how we the people have lost control of the goverment.The book was filled with stories of hide out drop outs and stupid things criminals do. Very entertaining even if you get no help on your goal to disapear.
1,Good dated info,This book was written before September 11. On that day everything in the world changed. I don't know to what extent that everything changed but I am now finding out. Avoid this book. It is heavily dated.
2,Same old [stuff]....,"The cover of the book makes big promises, but as I expected, it is nothing but filler material. The synopsis of the book can be written in one sentence: Change identity, move overseas, hide money, and be careful. How? Buy yourself an ID or a passport. That was the most direct advice in the book. The rest is written in broad generalities and suppositions. In summary, this book is just plain useless."
2,enticing,"It was a come-on, but in real life a flop. Sounded good in theory but when I hired the author to investigate a real subject, what he purported in his book wasn't done. I wonder if any of it is true or if it is only in the authors' James-Bond imagination.I tested the authors' assertions in a real life situation WITH HIM AS THE INVESTIGATOR. Not only did his ""investigation"" produce nothing, he was unable to justify WHY he was unable to produce any information, and which, if any, of the many techniques he espoused in his book, he used.His book makes for scintillating, make- believe reading but don't buy it if you think it has anything to do with what any private investigator , especially the author, can do in the real world."
4,Fun to read but refs are out of date,"I can't add a lot more to the reviews that said this is a fun book to read but not high on detail. Try searching for any of the books he mentions and you find they are out of print or non existant (like the Scope publications don't show up nor do the passport books). I like the way the book described the various countries and the good and bad, but it was hard to read as it seemed addressed to both a criminal in trouble and someone just wanting to disconnect. I had to remove the cover so people would not stare."
3,Offshore asset information is fascinating!,"This book is easy an easy read, and very fascinating. I was a little disappointed about the specifics in ""disappearing"", but Pankau gives you a good overview. I rated it a 3 because of the lack of detail, but I would rate it a 5 for info on offshore investments and the ins and outs of money transactions. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to make some ""offshore investments""."
4,Excellent guide for he beginner P T,This is an excellent book for someone contemplating extended travels. The author obviously has personal as well as first hand knowledge with the subject matter. I suggest this book for anyone who dreams of a less stressful life living abroad.
3,Interesting but....,"The book is touted as what is needed to know in order to hide ones identity......then it turns right around and tells how one, who is attempting to hide his/her identity, can be discovered by someone who reads his book. So if we all read his book, noone can hide from anyone, right. I'm sure those in the business of investigations know all the tricks...so although you may be able to make it harder to be tracked down, if someone doing the tracking has the same knowledge on all the tricks then one just cannot hide."
1,These dog snacks are awful,I have purchased these snacks in a plastic jar in the past. Could only get them in Iowa and couldn't find them locally so I was happy when I saw these on the Internet. WRONG!! The snacks are so stale and hard that I'm afraid to give them to my dog. He'll either break a tooth or choke. Vendor seems to be selling an old product.
3,Great covers are not supposed to be clones,"This guy has a great voice. A rich voice. A soulful voice. But he is not Marvin Gaye, he's not Al Green, and he sure as hell is not Otis Redding, and he insists on forcing the comparisons by attempting to sing just like his heroes over arrangements that are virtually identical to the originals. When he sings lesser known songs (""Harry Hippy"") or the lone self-penned tune (""Come In From the Cold""), the results are magical. Here's hoping he takes the road less travelled next time around."
4,A good album.,"I love Marc Broussard's voice, and I love what he does with embracing this great music genre. I enjoy this album a lot. My only minor complaint is that, the energy of the songs seem to be restrained just a bit. The songs (and I) beg for more instrumental playing and unrestrained energy. I heard Marc on the radio live at the Xponential concert (from radio station WXPN in Philadelphia), and the band was great and his voice was powerful and the songs really kicked. I wish this album would have captured some of that raw energy, which is obviously lying beneath the surface. But that being said, I still enjoy this album and recommend it for anyone who enjoys R & B soul."
4,sos: save our soul,Outstanding covers of many beloved and classic soul songs from the 70's and on. Broussard is first rate and well worth the listen--many times over.
4,Marc More of Marc Please,"Great soulful soulfelt covers but Marc every since I heard you do ""Back in Your Arms Again"" on a Bruce Springsteen covers compilation CD, I crave for your ""voice"" and your uniqueness. This CD is great but I have most of the originals and still play them on my old record player through my Fender Super Reverb amp in the basement with far too many beer stains on the top of the amp. The originals are priceless and now I want you to start delivering some of your own originals again ..... you see, covers are great but the real soul is in the heart of the writer of the song. Except for ""Back in Your Arms Again"" - don't tell the ""Boss"" but you blew him alway on that song and arrangement. Now, get back on the road and get back on the penning and your unique soulfulness will shine through again. I'LL WAIT."
5,Arkie sisters feel ya comin from our past but with hot sauce!!!!,"You can cry the blues so..I feel the smells, I taste your life. The stories are are from home,so familar andmake my heart remember a different time I had lost. Hooray I am still here after 54 years. yeah old but not dead. Gods gift go with your roots and add spice carefully to the gumbo. Families are great! Good kin and especially the bad. They have the most to tell. Stay straight with the man buy high and sell low it builds character. My sister and I listen to you from alabama to arkie. We go to sleep with your words above us and your voice sounds like all the men we love to love. She is a red head so watch out. Proud of you!!!"
2,Not very detailed,"Who buys a specialised food guide to Vietnam? Clearly somebody who loves food, probably a food geek. This means that the benchmark for a good book is high. This book contains the basics of Vietnamese ingredients and styles. No problem with that. However, more should be provided in a specialised book - much more. For instance a better distinction of different kinds of pho, etc. This would probably be hard for a westerner to accomplish without help of a local. I want to hear about Vietnamese food from somebody who has gone native, not just from somebody who loves food, read a few cookbooks and travelled a bit in Vietnam."
1,supernatural minus the winchesters,"I think the problem with this episode is simple. We tune in, or pay Amazon, to watch Sam and Dean do their thing. We do not tune in to see a few no name actors plod their way through a mediocre script with fake amateur camera work. These actors simply are not in the same class as Ackles and Padalecki and watching them was, well, kind of tedious.I am voting this episode down because I would like to discourage the producers from ever wasting another episode. This episode could easily have been part of some failed series. Not an episode in the 8th season of a hit like Supernatural. Please, producers, never do another episode with so little Sam and Dean in it.If I had known that the time was mostly taken up with no-name actors, plodding through an undistinguished script, with so little of Sam and Dean, I would have skipped it completely."
1,Worst episode ever,"I adore ""Supernatural"" but this is the worst episode of all so far. Very little of the Winchesters. Mostly about three college kids with our heroes thrown in--for what, I'm not really sure. Very disappointing. I hope this is the last one like this and they return to following our guys."
1,AWFUL,"This episode has to be the worst thing the series has ever done. No one tunes into SN to watch a bad home video with no talent actors and actresses -acting out a badly written story. It was painful.I overlook the misogyny and total boys club attitude of this show because good supernatural thrillers are far and few between, add in they have killed off Ellen and Bobby, who gave the boys their family-base and then they took out the rock music and then the car for an entire year. L really thought last season was AWFUL, but this, this makes last season look like a diamond."
1,awful episode,"I understand this was a new writer for Supernatural as well as a new director.Well clearly the writer doesn't understand Supernatural fans. We watch the show to see Sam Dean & Castiel. This weeks story was thin,we are all waiting to hear more about Dean, Sam, Castiel and the rest of the original cast.I was very disappointed hope the story gets better."
1,Worst episode ever,I think they simply tried to save money on this episode. it looked cheap and i agree with the guy above it is a rip off of the chronicle. all i can say is that if they showed this during Halloween i would have dropped the series completely and i have been a avid watcher and die hard fan since season 1 episode 1.
2,eh,As much as I have loved SPN. It should have ended with the conclusion of season 5. Very disappointed. Acting of JA and JP very good throughout.
2,The magic of this series is gone,"I hope this is the last season. I loved Supernatural when it was borderline scary. The old scripts were pretty good and aside from a few episodes (ghostchasers) they were clever. Now, however, there are more stupid episodes than good ones. Dean and Sam seem to be just coasting through the episodes. The loss of Bobby and his subsequent replacement with ""Garth"" (oh God why...if there were ever a annoying character it is him) was a stupid move. Goodbye Supernatural, may you rest in peace instead of continuing on as a shambling mockery of what you once were."
1,Supernatural season,I did not order. I removed the entire season from my watch list and was still billed for every episode. I am very disgruntled.
4,Tiger Mom ??,"If for no other reason, this episode of Supernatural should be watched for Jensen Ackles' performance. He is rocking Dean Winchester this season, now that he has some meat to work with. The Purgatory scenes with him and his vampire friend, Benny (Ty Ollson) are excellent acting, lighting, and editing. The episode was good for setting up the mytharc for this season. Supernatural is an awesome TV series with very talented people, both acting and production, working on it. I wouldn't miss it, and I'm not a big TV or sci-fi/horror fan. This one I like, though."
4,Nice,"Good show!!!!!!! The best i have seen must see, n quality its really good,the action its really intense yea ...."
2,Only episode I've deleted...,"I have watched, rewatched and purchased every episode/season of Supernatural to date. I've had a few that were not in my favorites list, but ""Bitten"" is the first episode that I have EVER deleted from my pc library. We have had episodes in the past where the Winchester brothers were not central stage (Ghostfacers, Weekend At Bobby's, etc.),those episodes had other qualities that made them very worth the time to watch. ""Bitten"" is, in short, a waste of film. Yes, the brothers do appear in several shots and give a short analysis of what they think might be happening. This episode however, does not stand up to the quality of the Supernatural brand. I am voicing my own oppion on this, watch it and evaluate it for yourself. I already have season 8 on pre-order."
5,keep them coming,Good episode. I have been a fan of the show since the first season and I am extremely pleased with the new story-line: back to where we started.
4,Solid Case of the Week Episode,"With the plot arcs the eighth season of Supernatural will follow firmly established, Supernatural takes a break to go back to ""hunting things...the family business."" In this case, murder victims are turning up with their hearts ripped out of their chests. And other people involved seem to have received organs from the same source. Supernatural mines a mythology that it hasn't explored yet in this solid win of an episode. Recommended. A-."
5,Great setup,"This episode serves as an excellent set-up for season 8; many of the old favorites are back and not don't the king of vampires is hiding out somewhere waiting to make another appearance. Season seven seemed a bit over-campy in spots, but this episode raises hopes that season eight will be equal to the best of the seasons."
2,Ugh... found footage.,"I am a bit disappointed with this episode. It wasn't bad, but I am no fan of found footage films, for one, and for another, this was pretty much a straight rip off of ""Chronicle"" -- nerdy, socially ill-adjusted kid gets superhuman powers, and soon becomes an amoral monster, all while filming it. I love this series; at its best, it's great. But greatness is seldom achieved by copying others, and that's what they did here."
5,Great start!,Loved this years season premiere. It caught us up and started us off with a bang. Makes one look forward to what's to come.
4,watch it,"Aside from the occasional liberal b.s. they toss in, this show is very entertaining. 8 years of hunting demons and such and it is never the same old thing."
4,Supernatural 8th season,I thouroughly enjoyed all the Supernatural seasons even though it does get a little blasphemous from time to time. I highly recommend starting at the beginning with season 1. This said the 8th season is on par with the previous seasons with the exception of a beloved character that is killed off and replaced with a one that is inadequate for the role.
5,Supernatural,This series keeps getting better! Love all of the new scenarios and surprises! Keeps me in my seat and leaves me wanting more!
5,interesting,"interesting, nice that you can buy episodes you missed during the current season. I recommend it to any who are interested."
5,Awesome continuation to a great story,Outstanding continuation to an amazing story. Sam's reluctance to continue in the family business presents a compelling dilemma to their ongoing quest to erradicate evil.
2,Tries too hard to be creative,"I must side with the majority of the reviews here. Maybe I've seen a worst episode in the past 7 seasons but none come to mind. The new director and writer put too much effort into what is an apparent goal of keeping the show fresh by tackling the storyline through a different angle, or maybe they just wanted to give the stars of the show most of the week off when making this episode. It is a shame because this season started off with one of the best episodes and perhaps set the bar too high. Keep with what works, and definately don't put less of the stars in the episodes, put more (hint, it is time for Castiel to come back and revive this season)."
2,Disappointed,"After watching Supernatural since it came out, this episode was one of the worst Ive seen. I found myself mostly uninterested and bored with the premise and nothing about it was a surprise. I have a difficult time staying interested in an episode that has almost nothing to do with the Winchesters. Ever since the Blair Witch Project it seems everyone wants to try their hand at this style of entertainment and it just doesn't do it for me."
4,would give it 3.5 stars if could cause was good acting,"I personally like the regular show a lot better, but compared to cloverleaf and other home-made types ...it was good."
5,Still rollin,"Its interesting. I've watched the brothers kill the yellow eyed demon, Lillith, Famin, pestilence, war, negotiate with death, capture Micheal and the devil and stop the apocalypse several times and I always think, ""How are they going to top this?"" and they always do. This season is more introspective that apocalyptic, but I look forward to every show."
4,Great show...just not one of the better seasons,"Supernatural has gone from a show I thought I'd never watch, to one of the most addictive shows I have ever watched. The first 5 seasons were fantastic, and it hasn't quite been the same since, but I have to see it through (because it was that good). The writing is not as imaginative, and it often gives the impression they are trying too hard to be more gory, a little too hard to be as funny as in seasons past, and just missing the mark a bit on compelling story lines."
5,The greatest,"I just love the supernatural series................they can never go wrong with me.....Sam, Dean and Castiel are the best...koodos to CW"
4,4 stars,I bought it; I watched it; I liked it. The end.Apparently nine more words are required for me to be able to give it 4 stars. I feel manipulated.
5,Real Old Fashion Country,"I really like this CD and just love Rick. He just has such a tone to his voice, brings out real emotions with his love songs."
4,Positive representation,"Usually when an artist gets the ""Super Hits"" treatment, there are many hits to choose from. Rick Trevino doesn't have a lot of volume (at least, not in English) to draw on, but this is a true hits package. This package is so good in my opinion it overshadows the back catalog. I am partial to ""Learning As You Go"" and ""Running Out Of Reasons To Run"", but all ten tracks are solid."
5,tilemans mixer,"I have used makita hp2010n for mixing thinsets and grouts for over 20 years. I have only gone thru 3 of them. The weight is not as bad as other big drills I have used,(and those I gave away).I was talked into buying a lighter model the 2050. I used it for the last 2 years, when when my third 2010 burned up. Somewhat of a mistake, not enough power, and Today april 18th 2009, it died after 2 short years.I'm buying my forth hp2010n on line right now. One thing it and simular hammer/drills of this type can't do is be a real hammer drill, they are all to slow. So buy a hammer drill that takes sds bits etc.I have bosch and makita sds hammer drills they work great. As far as mixing thinsets, grouts for tiling and regular drilling with great power, I haven't found anything on the market I like better. Oh yeah and 5,6,7 days a week for 7 years each. Well you do the math."
4,Animal Atlas DVD's,These came in just in time for Christmas. I was pleased because these were a last minute gift. My grandson watches these at bedtime and I like them because they are educational.
5,Great System,"The fourth edition of GURPS doesn't disappoint. This time, the basic book has been split&#12288;into two volumes. This one deals with the creation of characters and can be considered to be the player's guide. The genius of the GURPS system is that anything is possible. If you can dream of it, you can play it. It's a great system for those who would like to establish a game with a sense of independence and creativity. If you haven't tried it, I recommend that you give it a try."
1,Why do people like this version?,"I have played GURPS since it first came out and I was shocked and horrified by this version. I can't believe people are raving about it. The new version barely addresses the problems of the previous one, is poorly laid out and hard to read, and many changes were made to parts of the game where there were no problems to address. There's none of the humor of Steve Jackson's original work. The book reads like a technical manual. Thank you, but I'll stick with the old version or switch to a different system."
5,"Love this album, want more...","I truly loved this album, my Sister introduced me to it a few years back and I still love it. I wish they'd do something new... I'd really love to hear more from them. :)"
1,Totally bland...,"This band sounds like a cross between Nils Lofgren, Neil Young & Bob Dylan. You are probably now thinking, ""Sounds good."" Problem is there is nothing special at all here. Totally bland."
5,Wood should be Platinum,"A few weeks ago, about 12 friends were gathered at Sherlock Holmes Pub in Nashville, when the most wonderful music started playing. Without exception, each of the songs merited comments from all of us, and mind you, we are a cynical music-business-weary bunch! We asked Moire, the barmaid (and Nicky Hopkins' widow, BTW) what we were listening to and she said ""Wood"". Come again? ""Wood"". Hmm. Never heard of it, him, them, whatever. I did manage to find a copy at Borders, but only one, which led me to Amazon, where I'd previously searched. This time I had an album title, which made it easier. I have to say that Columbia Records needs to get off their lazy posteriors and let people know about this wonderful record. But..., it's no surprise that this is one record you have to search for. It's well worth the hunt. Beautifully written, played, performed, and produced, this will be my desert island disc for 2001."
4,"Half Good, Half very, very sad.","This is the Beatles in their most wretched state. Arguing, bored, resentful of each other's talents, each other's songs, each other's wives and lovers. Trying to paste together a session that ends up in such a bad state that John Lennon simply wanted to shelve this entire period, and put it away for good.On the other hand, this film has some of the most exciting filming of the Beatles ever done when they go on top of their Apple headquarters building in the cold month of January in 1969 and totally captivate a rag-tag audience. For that moment alone, this DVD has to be released. The promised unedited album would be another huge plus for us fans."
1,this DVD is fake,"this DVD is fake, homemade illegal copy. I even didn't try to play on my DVD player. it came in fake unsealed plastic box, Disk has all around scratches."
5,The Let It Be Film,"I don't understand why The Beatles Let It Be film is not on DVD format yet, I hope that this film gets released soon. Let It Be is special because it shows the Beatles making music and working toguether, Paul teaching the rest of the band the chords to ""Maxwell's silver hammer"", this is reason enough to get DVD title, also you get to see the break-up of the best band that ever existed."
4,Yoko.....UGH,"Anything this intimate on the Beatles is a must have. However, the editing is atrocious! The sound isn't much better during the Twickenham Studios section. Yoko is miserable. The rooftop set makes up for it all, though. I doubt they will ever release this on DVD. It's pretty depressing stuff, watching a great band break up.........and Yoko is MISERABLE!!"
4,September 2005,"This movie is basically about the making of an album but later falls apart into the breakup of the Beatles. We see Paul trying hard to keep the band together, while George seems agitated and Ringo and John seem like they could care less about the band.The program has some great music but I wouldn't reccomend getting one of the bootlegs because they are just bad quality. Rumor has it that the official remastered version of the DVD will be out on September 2005. It will also contain ""some remarkable bonus material"". The person that remastered it also did the Festival Express and he says that the viewers will be surprised on how good the quality is."
4,One of the best documentary movies ever,"If you're a Beatles fan, you got to have this DVD. One thing thats bad about this movie is when they argue. Remember, this was hard to find."
3,"We may never see this on DVD - But wait, good news!!","I just read a report that the 2 surviving members of the group have blocked the re-release of this film on DVD. Apparently they feel the release of this on DVD would show the group in a negative light. Do they actually think anyone will have a different opinion on The Beatles if this was released? Those who don't like The Beatles will never buy it anyway, so what's the difference?*** UPDATE ***I just read a report at Undercover Music News that the story about McCartney & Starr blocking the DVD release was untrue. in fact, Apple has confirmed that the movie will be released, but a date was not given."
4,Crucial Beatles Footage,"Tensions flare and personalities clash. Accurate portrayal of the fab four dissolving. The film culminates with a performance on the Abbey Road studio roof, the first live Beatles show in four years. Mayhem ensues and the police are called in to stop the madness. As for the music ""Let It Be"", with its angst and frankness, show a mature Beatles displaying both roots (One after 909)and feelings (I dig a pony). A must-have for Beatles fans."
5,"Black Dyke Mills, hard to find, hard to beat",This band made quite a few recordings but are not easily available despite their great arrangements of uptempo music. Sometimes we buy a CD for one number but most of these are welcome additions to any collection.
2,Makita HP1500 Hammer Drill,"The Drill is powerful and works well, but the keyless chuck is garbage. The chuck does not grip bits well, the bits spin in the chuck and turn an otherwise good drill into something worthless."
3,0000000000,"My book arrived in poor condition, broken spine and some soiled pages. I did not know I was buying a fryer for mini fryers, but the recipes were readily adabtible. Simple to understand, good tasting recipes were much appreciated. I would recommend this book to friends"
5,Like seeing an old friend...,"I'm so happy to see that this book is still available. Years ago, when they first came out, I bought a Presto Fry Baby. My son & I were living alone then and we used it all the time. This book provided great ideas for us to experiment with. Through the years I lost track of both the fryer and the book. Today I bough a new Fry Daddy. My next purchase will be this book. Mabel Hoffman has never let me down in any of her books!"
5,Glycolix Elite 18%,Great price on this cream. Other sites have it priced much higher. The cream is effective to smooth heals and elbows
1,Disappointed,"The good things about this book are: 1- It is spiral so it is easy to work with between the book and your computer; 2- It comes with a CD that has examples you can work with. The bad things I came across this book are 1- A lot of the examples were unclear as to what they wanted me to do; 2- Not enough illustrations to show how my work should look; 3- Annoying end-of-chapter true & false questions, fill-in's, matching... this style of questions are for 2nd graders. I'd much rather have mini-projects that reflect the exercises. All in all, I am returning the book, and am giving the FrontPage 2000 Bible a try. This Bible did not have any negative reviews so I am hopeful that this tutorial book will be more accomodating than Learning MS FrontPage 2000."
5,A Perahia gem beautifully restored,"Like many others in this series, this is a gem from the Columbia Masterworks back catalogue, beautifully restored and presented in this DSD transfer onto SACD. This late era analogue recording has excellent frequency response and dynamic range, and there is virtually no tape hiss. As in other recordings of this period from Columbia, there is a clearly articulated stereo image, which comes out vividly on this transfer.As for the performances, little needs to be said, other than the fact that they are already established classics in the Mozart concerto repertoire. If you love Mozart and don't have it, get it; if you already have it, and want to hear it as never before, get it."
4,Warhorses are still great music!,".... These are two beautiful compositions, that have been beautifully performed and beautifully recorded and beautifully rendered in the SACD format. Get this disc and any other SACD titles your heart desires, whether it's a recording of a warhorse or not. It's still great music and it will still move you."
2,Came with teeth but no Power!,"The saw probably works fine but it will be a while before anyone gets to use it! I bought the saw as a Christmas present. Great price-except it came in a trashy box with no case, no battery and no charger! How can one find a battery and charger for the saw on short notice. This item is not a complete package as a gift. I probably would not have bought it if I would have known the battery and charger were not part of the package. The blurb says, saw only and some blades. You would think that meant you would at least get one battery since the battery makes up part of the saw handle!Be careful, don't compare this saw to the one you would get at a hardware store. The real thing comes in a nice carrying case with one or two batteries and a charger. With this item you get a powerless saw and a couple of blades. I feel there was a bit of deception."
4,not a simple book,"Email is probably still the most important application on the Internet. More so than browsing. But setting up an email server can be fraught with complexity under unix or linux. In response, Taylor offers a straightforward guide to installing and running a server for a small company. One attraction about the book's software is that it is all open source and free.Understanding enough of it to usefully maintain it is another matter. But Taylor gives enough explanations of various key applications. Like Postfix and Procmail and SpamAssassin. This is still not a simple book. For example, SpamAssassin's classification of an email as possible spam is a statistical assessment based on a set of rules typically seen in spam. But it is quite possible for an email that you want to get hit by this and marked as spam. You might want to experiment with SpamAssassin's settings until you are comfortable with the results."
3,Good Effort,"Another title from my favorite publisher Packt. However, this book let me down. It is advertised as a practical guide to setting up a Linux e-mail server, it does excel at the advanced configurations and issue that especially those regarding spamassasin, squirrel-mail and general e-mail security. However, this book seems to skim over the the basic yet essential steps. You will probably need to read some internet tutorials to master the basics of an e-mail before tackling this title. Despite its short comings this is still the best single resource that I have found for advanced e-mail configurations."
2,"Pretty package, but...","I was not happy with this book, I found it boring without pictures, just black-white text. It didn't keep me motivated. The CDs included are also not very funny."
5,Best saw ever,I have one of these saws at work it is fantastic it cuts quick clean and with out heat. You can grab the metal with your bare hand as you take it out of the vise. The blade last for ever it seems and when you do need to replace it is able to be resharpened. I would rate this as one of best tols I've ever purchased.
5,Great Metal Saw !,"I made the mistake of getting a 12"" Harbor Freight metal cut-off saw at a great price. What a piece of junk (even with going with top quality aftermarket blades)! So, I ended up getting this Makita after seeing it in action at a friends house. It is sweet and definitely gets the job done."
3,"well, it ain't that bad","i saw this band open for somebody or other once in athens, and the lead singer was really hot and wore really amazing tight leather pants. you could say that worked for the band's advantage. these guys (and girl) are from atlanta, and play tortoise/sea and cake-ish type space-pop, with a few complicated droners thrown in...lots of dynamics, lots of tempo changes. you know, the sort of music that's a lot harder to play than regular rock and a lot harder to like. but we all find a way when we want to. this is a really subtle album, and that's why i like it. granted, this will primarily be utilized as background music whenever it finds its way into my stereo, but still...good background music."
2,disapointed,"I love Stereophonics, and Kelly Jones' voice. I liked one song on here, so I got the whole cd. Not really to my liking. Was very dark and depressing and not very musical. Very one note, and almost all the same sombre tones."
1,Can we say cash in on Elvis?,"I will never understand why June continues to rave about how she dated Elvis and still write books about him. That was way back in 1955!Elvis married his soulmate Priscilla Presley.June married and went on with her life to have two children. She has a 22 year old grandson.She also has two precious granddaughters of whom she has nothing to do with and does not talk to, their ages are 16 and 11.It's uncouth how June continues to use the Elvis name to make money."
3,"Great Story, but still don't understand something.","Well the book was nicely written, I enjoyed reading and curious to see what wasgoing to happen next. I believe she was honest in the sequence of events and reallyloved Elvis. However, I don't know why it was so surprising for her to find out Elviswas cheating on her when she dated him while he already HAD a girlfriend, Dixie. Junesays she dated him in 1955, well he was still dating Dixie untilthe FALL of '55 and then started dating Barbara Hearn afterwards until the winter of '56 which is aroundthe same time when Elvis and June broke up. I'm sure she MUST have known about them and still continued to date him until she had it when she heard about him inviting other women in Graceland during Christmas."
5,David Rio Flamingo Vanilla Decaf Sugar-Free Chai,Excellent taste and value! This is the best Chai I have found anywhere! Just wish it came with a scooper...
1,Scam,"This program installed fine, except when i went into the program, it wouldn't let me put a single DVD on it. It says it is CSS encripted. Did you know that the only DVDs thar r not CSS encripted are home videos."
5,Mine Works Great,I purchased an online download of this program shortly after I bought my Video iPod. It has worked like a dream for me. It comes in really handy with my networked Tivo.
1,Keep looking,"Didn't install correctly for me due to a very poor installation program. Once installed, it usually wouldn't run, and when it did it didn't do much. Uninstalled it and tossed the disc in the trash.I'll reuse the box it came in."
5,A story from the birds view,This is a nature book about the last of the eskimo curlew bird. It's intermingled with actual news paper articles from bird watching groups who discuss the situation. The author puts you in the position of the bird and its struggle for survival. I first read it on a readers digest condensed book and then bought the hard copy. (from amazon). The way its written you would think the bird was actually sitting on his shoulder telling him what to write. An excellent nature book and one i have re read 3 times now.
4,Tragic saga of one of the last Eskimo Curlews,"This is the tale of the last of the Eskimo Curlews. Fromthe beginning of his migration in the Canadian Arctic to itsreturn the following year. Just prior to extinction, thismale curlew had problems trying to find a mate. He finallyfinds a female, but doesn't quite make it back to thebreeding grounds with her.This short story closely follows the round-trip migrationof the Curlew from the Arctic to South America and back. Itis written from the perspective of another curlew watchingthe troubles of the last of its kind."
2,book,"This was a somewhat mediocre quality book and it was a paperback, not hardcover. Much too expensive for the quality received."
4,Good all around camera,"For the price this is a great camera. Built in zoom works well, takes excellent pictures with little to no light. A little bulky, but for the size of the lens and quality of pictures it takes, a great camera.My software quit working at about 6 months, and I am currently replacing the camera with a remanufactured one for the same price the camera store is telling me that it would cost me to fix my camera.Hopefully the new one lasts longer than 6 months. That would be my only complaint about the camera. I got a Service Error 10 after 6 months of use... which the camera store tells me is a software issue with the processor... and cost $160 to fix. So for $170 I ordered a new one with a few extras."
5,Excellent Reliability & Ease of Use,"I have had four of these drives for nearly a year. They are quiet and give off little heat. When initially connected via firewire or USB 2.0, Windows XP recognizes them without difficulty, which is not something I can say for other brands I have used. When connected via firewire, they can be chained together since two firewire ports are provided on the back of each unit. There is no on/off switch, which may be inconvenient if you expect to shut down a drive frequently. The neon lights are fairly subdued, even in near darkness. Personally, I think they look good, but that is not the kind of feature I would base a purchase decision on anyway."
1,BAD EXPERIENCE,"I have always had good experiences with WD drives, so when I needed an external ""backup"" drive, I purchased this one(purchased 11/03). Over the next 3-4 months I would backup my data to the drive. Each time, I would power up the drive, copy my data, when completed I would ask Windows to disconnect the drive, then I would power it down. Recently (5/04, 6-months later) I needed to restore my data from this drive, after many loud clanking sounds, the drive now cannot copy any of the data from the drive. This drive was not disturbed, jarred, dropped etc. In fact, it has not moved at all since I installed it and it had less than 10 hours of total uptime on it. I am very disappointed in this product from WD.I now face the decision: do I spend $$$ to recover the data and have the warrenty voided, or do I just ""let it go"" and get a replacement drive and hope this doesn't happen again."
5,Can A Hard Drive Be Cool?,"I've had no problems whatsoever with this drive, nor with the two 120 Gb Special Edition Western Digital internal drives in my computer. This 250 Gb drive is great for backing up the two internal drives (though I'm a long way from filling them up), then carrying elsewhere to store away from the computer. And the colored lights in the case do make this drive look really cool."
2,Audio Quality on CD is terrible.,"OK, I own about 8 Stereolab CDs. Whenever I listen to this one, I have to jack up the volume in order to hear it properly. I can't believe I am the only one who has noticed this."
4,An old-fashioned diplomatic/military history,"I agree with the previous review. This book offered provocative conclusions about the origins of World War I: first, that precipitating the war and bringing in the reluctant British was the aim of French and Russian diplomacy, and second, that Serbia was a ""rougue terrorist nation""--my words, not Goodspeed's--wholly undeserving of the support provided by Russia in the weeks after Franz Ferdinand's assassination. The history of the Balkans from about 1871 to 1914 provided by the first two chapters is very valuable and relevant given today's headlines.This book is a sort of old-fashioned diplomatic and military history which seems to be out of fashion today. It focuses on an overall strategic view of the two wars. Such a view contrasts sharply with, say, the focus on soldiers' experiences which the PBS documentary ""The Great War"" presented."
1,Garbage,"This embarrassingly awful film, released in 1972, features some fairly well-known B-movie actors from that era, including Grant Williams, Ruta Lee, Mala Powers, and, for some odd reason, musical star Bobby Van. I suppose devotees of truly terrible films might get a smile out of the absurd plot, wooden dialogue, atrocious acting, and laughably cheap production values. I just felt bad thinking that this was the final film performance of Williams, who had actually been a professional musician (opera singer, pianist) before going into acting. His earlier science-fiction films (notably, ""The Incredible Shrinking Man,"" but also ""The Monolith Monsters,"" and ""The Leech Woman"") and soap operas (""Written on the Wind,"" ""Susan Slade"") may not have been masterpieces, but no one should go out of this world with a cinematic pustule like ""The Doomsday Machine"" as their parting contribution to civilization."
5,"The Master, Paul Calle!","What Norman Rockwell did for oil painting, Paul Calle does for the pencil.Beautiful illustrations, masterful text and instruction."
2,Basically a lesbian primer,"I don't understand all these rave reviews. The book essentially asserts (as the song goes) - free your mind and the rest will follow. I'm all for that, but the authors have bent the whole thing in a lesbian direction, while giving lip service to liking men. They are certainly liberated from much of society's norms, for which I applaud them, but listen guys, don't get this for your wife or girlfriend, it's definitely not man-friendly."
4,Eye opening,"I couldn't stop reading this book. I have always felt somewhat alienated by my inability to appreciate a monogamous lifestyle and not feeling it is the natural course for every (if any) couple. This book really helped me feel not quite so alone in respect to my value system of loving whomever, whenever and for whatever reasons. Not necessarily just having sex (which the book does not detail too graphically) but honest communion with other human beings which does not deplete the love for anyone else. ""Starvation economics"", as it is referred to in the book is not how love works. Just as you could never love one of your own children less than any other of them, it is possible to apply this to friends and lovers as well. There IS enough love to go around and this book helped me come to terms with how to express this."
4,An Interesting Read,"I can believe that this lifestyle takes a lot of work when you're being honest & open and telling everyone about everyone else & with all the safer sex practices to employ, it's a wonder anyone would opt for it except that it's sounds extremely rewarding (especially when everyone is honest & open). It sounds very liberating when everything else seems so inhibiting. As they describe it, it still centers around a primary partnership which I wouldn't be interested in because primary partnerships still sound too much like marriage to me."
4,"Dazzling, Informative and simply marvelous.","Great book.I have never read anything that told it like it was. It simply made me feel wonderful, knowing that there were others like me and that it was ok."
5,Wonderful even for the monogomous lifestyle,"This is an absolutely wonderful book. Even if you are monogomous, it has astounding tips on how to improve yourself and your relationship; dealing with things like jealousy and self esteem. I don't care if you're gay, straight, bi, A-sexual, transsexual.... whatever! Get this book, you WON'T regret it!"
5,It isn't easy being poly,"and Easton and Liszt are fully aware of this fact. This book is very clearly laid out to allow you to slowly read and think about the idea of being poly or of having more than one sexual partner in a certain period of your life... The Ethical Slut gives great realistic advice on how to be ethical. I highly recommend that it be read out loud and with your partner(s) and that you go slowly, maybe a chapter a day, so you can discuss the issues and ideas in it. This book is not about converting but about healthfully doing what studies indicate many so-called monogamous people do by having multiple partners."
2,A mixed bag of information,"For the first few chapters I was disappointed in the views of this book in that the authors seem to have great disdain for anything even vaguely resembling monogamy - or even fidelity. While I know that monogamy is not an appropriate choice of lifestyle for everyone, I also know that polygamy is not a healthy lifestyle choice for every personality either.Toward the second half of the book the authors views seemed to become more expansive and they spent some time explaining that different arrangements are necessary and healthy for different individuals.Overall, the book was not what I expected but I did find several sections to have useful information in them. I must say that the section about dealing with jealousy was very enlightening and the section on ethical behavior was also quite useful. There is even a section on fidelity, whether practiced in monogomaous or polygamous relationships, which I found to have solid information in it."
2,Good Ideas but the anti-male attitude is hurtful,"This book came highly recommended. It does, in fact, have a lot of good ideas and good things to say about personal freedom. However the abundance of gratuitous male bashing throughout is a real turn off. Bad examples are always male. Good examples are always female. Male-negative comments are used liberaly whether or not they have anything to do with the particular subject at hand. Prejudice is not ""ethical"" even if it's anti-male prejudice. Perhaps a good book for feminist lesbians but not recommended for men or women who love men. Hate is not a postive value."
4,slut review,"i really like the book, i thought it was great how it gives pointers on how to deal with your emotions and how you could make yourself ready for this type of a relationship with yourself and others. it was really interesting in the beginning and then sloped down towards the end, but the information is great regardless, i would recommend this book to anyone and everyone i know. it's a great way to have insight to the way other people live even if that's not how you live."
3,broad advice for couples,"I found this book average. It contains a lot of good strategies for communication between partners, generally, not specifically about the topic of slutdom (I use the term slut in the same affirmative way as do the authors).This book is not about polyamory, as stated by another reviewer. This book is about sex, and the lifestyle that provides for a very open sexuality....That being said, the book offers some good communication tools, but spends on a lot of time describing barriers to this lifestyle , both contemporary and historic. For me, that wasn't of much interest.The undercore of respect as an ethical slut, is a key one and to the credit of the authors underpins the book throughout. This key concept, important in all relationships, is even more important when attempting a lifestyle that flies in the face of most relationship taboos and norms.Not a bad read, just not an amazing one for me, hence the ambivalent 3/5"
1,Not Zen,Sorry but there is no balance to this book. I agree with the concept but not witht he method of teaching. You can't bash guys just because you don't like them. It's the same as bashing lesbians or gays or black people or white people...
4,Very good book!,Read this book with an open mind. It gives such great detail about expectations and gives helpful guide lines regarding any aspect that a relationship might come across and great how to's and don'ts when it comes to open communication between multiple people. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to expand their relationships deeper and with more passion to find out how to dig deep inside partnerships.
4,Great book. Great idea. Time to move out of our comfort zones!,"This is a great book. I couldn't help but relate it to some stories I've been reading on Literotica dot com by an author who writes under the name ""Romantic1"". His stories as well as this book down play the difficulties of dealing with the rest of society when you adopt a polyamorous life style. What you end up doing is picking your friends as ones sympathetic to your life style not necessarily those that will help you grow and evolve in new dimensions. Reminds me too of the book Open Marriage by George and Nena O'Neill back in the early 1970s. Changes in this direction can't happen fast enough to suit me!"
3,"Flawed, but very complete.","If you're looking for easy-reading, look further. Though the two Dim-Mak encyclopedias include everything you'd ever want to know about this martial/healing art, trying to understand it is another story. The photos are of no help, the diagrams a little creepy to look at, and since the actual point illustrations only appear at the end of each chapter, there is alot of flipping back and forth to do. The book uses alot of chinese terms, and while some find this a good thing, it at times gets confusing to the lay person. Also, the author keeps refering to points not presented yet, so again, lots of going back and forth. As far as dim-mak books go, this is your best bet.. my big complaint is really just the layout/presentation, because otherwise this is a great book."
5,Encyclopedia of Dim-Mak,"This is an excellent source of knowledge for the martial artist interested in focusing on more than the simple 'smash and bash' techniques. I found the illustrations most helpful in identifying where pressure points are located. The ironic thing is that most of us would not be able to accurately hit these points and do any real damage due to the fact that the necessary weapon may be a finger or single knuckle strike. I have trained for over 10 years and would not resort to that type of strike since I don't condition my hands for those techniques. Overall, this is a superb body of knowledge for someone aspiring to a higher 'mental' level. It certainly gives you quite alot of information to consider in your training."
4,"detailed, but maybe exagerated","This encyclopedia does a very good job of organizing information about the points for easy reading and look-up. Also, if the fairly specific descriptions of each point's location (it has a lot of medical jargon, but if you look that stuff up, it makes finding the points easy) don't tell you exactly where each one is, the diagrams at the end of each chapter will.In the forward, and in the description of each point, is an introduction to Chinese healing (including a bit on massage, acupuncture, and more, plus some general information), and a look at Dim Mak from the healing perspective.The only problem I have with this book is that it seems that the effects striking, rubbing, or pressing the points has is exaggerated; almost all off them cause death or a knock-out. I've looked at other sources' description of specific points, and they've mentioned only smaller effects like loosening the muscles of an elbow to allow for an elbow-lock."
3,Encyclopedia of Dim Mak,"The book itself is loaded with excellent information, however the binding of the book leaves alot to be desired. Had the book 3 days and the pages started falling out. This isn't a freak accident because a friend of ours had the same happen to him."
1,Think about it... please!,"Assuming that Dim-Mak pre-dates modern weaponry, would it not be reasonable to assume that such knowledge would make an army veritably invincible? Anyone recall reading about an invincible army? No. Why? One can kill during hand to hand combat, but not by means of acupressure. I rank this book right up there with Santa Claus and really bad K'ung F'u movies. By the way, it's also impossible to jump 12 ft up in the air and land on a tree branch backwards. Don't believe everything you see. The shortcut to true martial art proficiency lies in practice coupled with devotion. Direct your time and studies wisely."
5,A Unique And Fun Approach To Home Theater DVD Diagnostics,"This DVD is not your ordinary Home Theater beep, whistle and ethereal space sounds designed to test your speakers. You can have some fun with this fair in showing off your home theater system, especially, if you enjoy the seasonal sights and sounds of Mannheim Steamroller who perform MOONLIGHT AT COVE CASTLE, MOZART QUARTET IN C MAJOR - MENUETTO WATERFALL, NIGHT PARTY and GOD REST YE MERRY GENTLEMEN. This DVD-Video demo includes Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1. American Gramaphone's Home Theater Demo DVD is a must for anyone who has a home theater system: I completely enjoyed the diagnostics, music and visuals. The music of Mannheim Steamroller will push the capabilities of your home theater system to the max."
2,ROLL THIS,"I thought I liked Mannheim until they sent me this garbage. Does demo mean ""destroy"" after you hear the whole ""dvd"" in about 10 minutes? I thought there would be some music on there but there is really only 2 songs and some ancient footage with mediocre acting-- The only cool things are the asteroid comet thing which is already on other mannheim dvd's. RIPOFF!!! They shouldve sent this out free with their other dvd's."
1,Not worth the money,"I should have been warned by the title Home Theathor Demo, for that what it was just Demo, a selection of various images, one just some jumping lines in time to the music. It was a disappointment. It should have been free or a token fee like $2.99. It was not worth the $17.99 I paid for it.I am going to return it for a refund."
1,"useless dvd, won't play, recorded on foreign equipment....","home theatre video featuring Mannheim Steamroller...won't play on ordinary equipment. The seller explained to me after my complaint, that it was recorded on German equipment and won't play on American equipment. No wonder it was so cheap...everything else I ordered worked fine. But this one is useless. Don't buy it."
1,Why Bother?,"Such a royal piece of junk. This DVD is not worth my time or money. As soon as christmas is over, it is going back to the store."
1,Not a good quality of Pearls,"I ordered this necklace for christmas last year for my mother-n-law thinking it was going to be a good quality set of pearls but it was very cheap looking. Don't buy this product. It had dried up 'glue' still stained around each pearl. The price of the necklace doesn't match the quality, neither does the picture on this site. Stay Away!!"
4,WHAT YOU EXPECTED FROM RZA,"THIS ALBUM IS 30% ENGLISH AND 70 % GERMAN, FRENCH AND SWEDISH, RZA ONLY RHYMES ON 6 OF THE TRACKS BUT EACH AND EVERY TRACH IS PHAT, ALL STAYING TRUE TO RZA'S USUAL PRODUCTION STYLE AND QUALITY. STRICTLY NON COMMERCIAL AND FOR TRUE WU FANS. THE ALBUM IS HIGHLY RECOMENDED FOR EVERYONE THAT WANTS SOME NEW SOUNDS WITH THE RELIABLE RZA PRODUCTION.SPECIAL MENTION IN INLAY OF CD, NEW MASTA KILLAH COMING SOON, CANT WAIT."
5,Beautiful music for a french movie,"I think everyone who has seen Leos Carax' great film 'Les Amants du Pont Neuf' will remember the beautiful, expressive Sonate pour violoncello seul, op.8 by Zoltan Kodaly, played in the film by a musician named Julien in the corridors of the Paris Metro. It's a wonderful piece, timeless and full of emotional power. Yo-Yo Ma really is a great musician who does not hesitate to follow a path of his own, exploring great but neglected pieces of music. The other pieces are in a very similar mood, but Kodaly's piece is outstanding."
2,What a horrible performance,"This disks contains some interesting works from four lesser known composers and one giant masterpiece from Zoltan Kodaly. Unfortunatelty, Yo Yo Ma manages to create a terrible (not just bad or weak, but truly horrible) interpretation of one of the jewels of solo cello. From timing to dynamics and intonation, everything is just plained wrong. A HUGE desapointment."
2,Sheng's pieces are a collection of pseudo-ethnic ...,Sheng's pieces are an example of pseudo-ethnic commercial opportunistic music. The rest is worth listen to.
2,Disappointing at best,"Though it adheres reliably to a smoothe shower wall, it's claims of ""fogless"" are far from true. Even if you allow water to run over it to warm it up, it still provides adequate viewing only when constantly wiped clean. It will get you through your morning shave, but just barely!"
1,Never met a singer I didn't hate.....,"While Bartoli is on the cover, she is really not the center topic of this book. It's really about the people that make opera ""big"" today. The author never misses an opportunity to slam any singer that crosses her path or someone else's path. What bothers me most is here is an obviously intellegent woman who seemingly makes most of her income in a world that she so abhors. Perhaps she felt better about herself after writing the book but it does little for the world of opera. My guess her research consisted of reading a couple of months of any Opera bulletin board on the Web for the trash she re-cycles."
1,"This ain't writing, it's word processing!","What does an author do when she doesn't have enough material to fill a book on the subject of her biography? Digress by trashing every other opera singer she can get a dig in. Is it any wonder why singers can be paranoid, neurotic, and overly sensitive? Of course her favorites, such as Tebaldi get passed over as though ram's blood was smeared on their dressing room doors. My suggestion is talk to a friend who's read the book already. They'll probably remember the nastiest digs and save you the money as well as the 15 minutes it takes to read this."
4,It WORKS!!!,"I've used this on a VX5200 and a VX8100, and it's a great little charger. The only drawback is that the charging cable could stand to be about 2 feet longer. But it works and it's a great price."
3,The good novel that could have been great,"Glass does a great job in getting the reader into the story, creating an interesting plot and intricate characters. Nevertheless, towards the end the action is too rushed and events unfold without a clear connection. It seems to me as if the author had to comply with a deadline and could not finish the book in the way it deserved. This series will get another chance from me, and hopefully the experience will be better next time!"
3,Generally Solid Books,"I have enjoyed Leslie Glass' writing a great deal but have found that I need a break from reading her books too close together. I love reading a series in order as I like to see the character progession and development. I also like the feeling that I am getting to know the characters. In that vein though, I can get frustrated at the communication that the characters show. In most of the books I want to shout at April to just tell her mother how she feels! I know communication exists like that but I find it frustrating.Overall the stories are engrossing and very interesting with a great focus on New York. I love books that show me a great deal about the area they are in. I would suggest these books to anyone who likes detective mysteries that are not graphic. Very solid series, just can't read them in a row."
2,not my flavor,"I bought this book based on the reviews of others who had read it. It should be noted that I did not finish the book, so it could have gotten better, I just didn't think it was worth my time trying to find out."
4,Great for the Casual Funk Fan,"This album gives you a good ""Best of"" the genre collection. Many of the most popular funk songs are here. While there are more comprehensive collections, this one gives you the most bang for your buck."
3,Born of Night,I don't get the great reviews. Obviously an early attempt at this genre by Kenyon. Has some of the elementswe have grown to love and expect in one of her books but lacking somehow.Kind of like some of her most recent works.Think I'm gonna pass on the next two releases in this series.
2,Same pattern,"I love DH series. This one is similar to every other DH or other books by SK. Tortured hero- check. Heroine has some issues but manages to heal hero- check. Doom and gloom- check. Other hero's friends are also tortured- check. Remarkedbly short time for hero to accept heroine while he never trusts his own best friend- check.This is getting tiredsome. At least DH has some interesting characters but in general, their stories follow the same pattern. I feel like I read different version of a book. It seems like every hot (and 7 ft tall) men are tortured.Unless SK writes some DIFFERENT book (meaning no tortured hero), I feel very weary to pick up her book now because I can almost have a pretty accurate image after reading the sypnosis."
2,say it ain't so,"If you have never read a romance novel. If you've never read an early Dark Hunter Novel. Then by all means read this.If you have no imagination. Or if you can stop thinking for a while. Then by all means read this book.But if you expect more. Do not like obvious plot lines, sentences, or characters. Than this will not be the book for you.Or just read Night Play. Now that is a good Kenyon book.And do NOT get the auido book. Gawh!!!"
2,Just don't go there,"I love have read every single one of Ms. Kenyon's DHS books and Dream Hunters. I have even gotten people to read these books because they really capture to eye and you are really there and can't put it down. I had orginially intended on buying all the League Novels. However after TRYING to read the first one...I am left more than disappointed. What a waste of Ms. Kenyon's time. The Dark Hunter Series is the best ever!!! I have read all the books at least 3 sometime 4 times a piece and ""Born of Night"" I can't even get myself past the first few chapters.Many people say ""If it isn't broke don't try to fix it."" The Dark Hunter Series is the best reading material. Anyone who have read these books would have to agree.Honestly...Aliens in Outerspace...different planets? Not Fantasy romance more like Science Fiction.I'm sorry Ms. Kenyon, but I want my Dark Hunters back!! Please"
4,Typical Kenyon,"I was looking forward to Born of Night after reading some good reviews and wasnt disappointed. The story was good and the characters well written. My only gripe is that it was a little to familiar to her DH characters e.g tortured man, family abandoning him, beautiful woman teaching him to love etc etc.Good secondary characters"
4,Not as good as Dark Hunter.....,"But it will give you something different to read!!! It was very good but left me wishing for more Dark Hunters!! It's set in the far future and has aliens and stuff in which is not my bag of chips. But the love story and chemistry between the Characters kept me reading, and interested enough to read Born of Fire directly after!!! Now I have to wait for Born of Ice..."
4,It was good.,The book was good but it moved a little slow in the beginning. I had to put the book down and got back to it later.
2,born of light thought,"Summary of the critiqueThis book was really poor.What I likedI liked the characters.Why I liked itThe idea was good. The execution was really bad, filled with deux x machine, and poorly executed plot devices.What I didn't likeThe plot was OK. The execution was poor. The understanding of science was really poor.Why I didn't like it.The material is really weak."
2,Out there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the first Sherrilyn Kenyon book I have ever tried to read. I love unusual romance novel however this book was just really far out there, and frankly not that good. The characters seemed boring at times and the story seem to being moving slow."
3,Just okay.,"While I'm a fan of the author, this book was just okay. I suppose if I'd read it in its true chronological order (first, before I'd read any other Kenyon books) I'd have liked it better. It is clearly an early book from and author who had not reached her potential. As a fan of her Dark Hunter books, it was fun to play ""spot the character"". She has recycled character from this series and names for her Dark Hunters: Nykyrian is a mix of Acheron and Kyrian, names such as Julien and Syn make appearances. Though they have different names, even Nick, Liza, and Styxx make appearances. It is fun for fans and will give you a Kenyon fix as you wait for the next DH book, but it is really only okay."
5,Born of Night Hooked Me on Sherrilyn Kenyon ... Fantastic!,The league books are my favorite Sherrilyn Kenyon books! The characters hook you in and it's hard to put the books down. A definite must read!
1,One of the worst books I've ever read!!,"I hate stories about tortured heroes, but this hero is tortured beyond anything believible. Kiara is just plain stupid. Her motto seems to be ""My life is in danger but I'm going to do everything stupid that I can think to do"". Poor writing and annoying lead characters who are too stupid to let live. I will find a different author to read."
5,"Totally different than Kenyon's Dark Hunter Series, but still really good","While the character of Nykerian was fully developed, the lead female character, Kiara, was nothing more than a rich, spoiled brat. And really, that is that was said about her. Therefore, how Nykerian could possibly want any kind of relationship with her does not make any sense. However, the characters Nykerian, Syn, Cruel and Hauk make up for Kiara.If you are attracted to masculine, emotionally damaged but strong, lethal,compassionate, morally questionable and intelligent ""bad boys"" with a sense of honor this is the series for you!This is more a science fiction book than a paranormal romance, and I am a huge fan of Kenyon's Dark Hunter series. Thus, the first time I read the books I was a little disappointed with this series. However, after reading all of them (written to date) I came to really like them."
3,FoxyDC,"I have enjoyed most of this author's works. A bit of a formula---big sexy tough guy meets a feisty woman who tames him. Great action and super sex. This author always delivers. I wish her editor would explain that ""waiting on"" and ""waiting for"" are different concepts. This jarring error stops me every time it occurs. ""Waiting on"" is serving---as a waitress, sales clerk or butler might do. Perhaps it is a regional expression but it is inaccurate. ""Waiting for"" is anticipating an event."
3,"Good story, but....","The female lead was such an unlikeable wuss! Yes, she had shattering traumatic events in her childhood, but nothing compared to the horrors Nemesis went through. I liked all the characters except Kiara. She just seemed so hypocritical. BUT, it's a great start up for another fabulous series by Kenyon. I definitely will read the next in the series!"
4,"I loved the characters, but way too much self hate.","I love Nykirian and Kiara's relationship, but I started to feel uneasy about how the author tends to go overboard on the hero's self hate. It ruined it."
5,Intergalactic Princess Bride,"I couldn't put this book down, and I couldn't figure out why. But I felt like I had seen this story line somewhere else...and then it dawned on me.... The romantic interraction between the two characters is much like Wesley (as Dread Pirate Roberts) and Princess Buttercup in the princessbride. ""You mock my pain!"" ""Life is pain!"" Ahhhh...a childhood story retold with gratuitous sex and violence.... TWO THUMBS UP!"
2,Harlequin Romance,"Basically a romance plot with some entirely incidental sci-fi elements (i.e., the plot is easily disjoinable from the setting, and the ramifications of the setting aren't a major issue). Readers will be spared having to figure out the motivations and characteristics of the main characters, since the author helpfully spells these out in detail and with great frequency, rather than risk having someone make deductions based on the characters' actions and dialog. If you like authors like Vance, or are the type that tends to wonder how the gadgets and cultures actually work, there is very little chance you will like this novel."
4,Eagerly awaiting for the next.............,"Picked this book up a few days ago and I eagerly devoured it in 2 days. Loved it, Nykerian, and Kiara were an unmatched couple at first, but she showed her true strength despite her small size when it counted. Princess Kiara, a Ballet Dancer is a target by the League, and her father calls in Nykerian and his band of warriors to protect his daughter. Unfortunately, Nykerian and his warriors become the target by her father and his soldiers. Sounds comfusing, not really just an action packed book that had me until the very end. I loved all the characters and my heart went out to these men, that have been picked on by everyone, and they did not deserve it. Can't wait to read the next book in this series called Born in Fire, with the hero being Syn, my favorite of the guys. If you want to read a Sci-Fi novel with loads of action, romance and humor read this book."
5,Very good for nontechnical people!,"As an interior design major who isn't wild about the technical part of the field, I have found this book both informative and easy to read. My classmates agree!"
2,"Would have liked to like it, but ...","The manual is so cryptic and poorly written that I'm not sure how to use this execise bike or even if it is working properly. I have a mechanics and science background in case you are wondering. This is a German made product and the multilingual manual is supposedly written for Great Britain users but is among the most poorly conceived operating manuals I have ever come across. I hope the German version is better! I guess if you are fluent in German you may have an easier time than I. I will try to contact the company to see if I can get some help. If not, I might have to return this item."
2,Strictly for Fans,"Unless you're a rabid fan of Frampton it's kinda sad seeing him up there with this lacklustre band churning out those classics from Frampton Comes Alive - sure, his voice is totally intact, his guitar playing is all there and he looks healthy enough (although it's pretty hard reconciling this trim, greying and bespectacled mid-lifer with the image of that 70's rock star with the Roger Daltery-esque curls.) But it's a pretty shlocky concert and it just lack all the elements that defined him as a terrifically talented and cool star in the 70's.The sound quality (on DTS) is fine so I give this one two stars."
5,BEST ROCK DVD I OWN.,Phenomenal quality; uninterrupted concert; Frampton and Mayo rock. Great energy. Solid from beginning to end. What rock and roll DVDs should be like. No gimmicks. Beautifully produced.I also enjoyed Peter's interview for the DVD. Very informative and entertaining.Peter's guitar work absolutely smokes!
5,ROCK YOUR HOUSE DOWN!!!!!!,"BOUGHT THIS DVD WITHOUT EVEN OWNING A PLAYER. I TAKE IT EVERY WHERE THERE MAY BE A CROWD AND THE RESPONSE IS THE SAME. ""WHO IS THIS GUY AND WHERE CAN I GET THIS CONCERT?"" PETER FRAMPTON WAS MY VERY FIRST CONCERT AS A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD. SAW HIM AGAIN LIVE ON HIS ""BREAK'N ALL OF THE RULES"" TOUR IN THE EARLY NINTIES. THIS MASTERPIECE BROUGHT EVERYTHING FRAMPTON IS ABOUT RIGHT INTO MY LIVING ROOM AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS. I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT THAT THIS SINGLE PERFORMANCE WOULD BRING SO MANY PEOPLE TOGETHER AS KIDS IN THEIR EARLY TEENS AND ADULTS IN THEIR FIFTIES HIGH FIVED TO FRAMPTON AND HIS STYLE OF MUSIC AND HIS GUITAR HERO STATUS. THE GREATEST QUOTE I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME WAS FROM SOMEONE IN THEIR EARLY TWENTIES PROCLAIM, ""IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR GUYS THAT OLD TO ROCK THAT HARD!!!!""IF YOU LIKE PETER FRAMPTON, BUY THIS DVD AND SHARE IT WITH FRIENDS AND STRANGERS ALIKE! HISTORY IS REPEATING IT SELF. "" FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE AGAIN!!!"""
4,Good concert!,This DVD has excellent video as well as audio (DTS). The interveiw with PF is indepth without being too detailed. It's laid back but not boring. A real plus is that it doesn't interrupt the concert footage. A few times the the band kind of goofs around a little and this seems to disrupt the pace of the show. But Frampton is as much up on his vocals and chops as I have ever heard him. He has a good bunch of players with him including Bob Mayo who was with him back in the seventies. Overall this is a good concert performance. A real treat if your a Frampton fan.
4,Not bad..........but,"i dont know. a little disappointed with this one. the cameras were on the audience way too much. i just didnt feel like i was there, like the best dvds make you feel.sure, the dts is good, and Frampers can really play, but it could have been better. i blame this entirely on the camera work. check out Neil Young-Silver and Gold. no audience shots at all. now this dvd made me feel like Neil was playing in my living room. thats the best concert dvd ive seen yet...........Do you, you, feel like i do?"
5,Frampton is Still Alive!,Wow! Wasn't really expecting too much from this. Reality always seems to disappoint when one's memories have had too long to crystalize. This was certainly the exception to the rule. Frampton has lost none of his talent and his voice is as crisp as ever. His guitar playing only seems to have improved. It just goes to show that a great talent (like a good wine) only gets better w/ age. This is almost never the case w/ one-hit wonders. I'll buy a ticket the next time he plays live in my area.
4,frampton only gets better with age,bought this dvd the first day out and it rocks. The video tranfer is crystal clear and the 5.1 encoding sounds great on by bose acoustamas 15.... Peter looks at peace with himself and the other members of the band and I've always said he is one of rocks greatest guitar players and he proves it here.
5,Peter Frampton 1999 live Detroit is A+,"So xmas has passed and you did not get this DVD, buy it for yourself. I just watched it again for the umpteenth time, still a great concert. If you are looking for special effects (aka fog, ice, wind, etc, great photography, haircuts, stylistic editing - then forget this DVD. But if you like truly solid music by a talented musicians who are an ensemble, this is it. Thank you Mr. Frampton."
5,Great DVD,This is a vry well done music DVD. I have lots of concerts and this is one of my favoites. A must have for any person who loves live shows but not the crowds. Enjoy!!!!!
5,how to stop all the nonsense spited about Godel's theorems,"The problem with Godel's theorems is that they are used as arguments for results in mathematics and philosophy of mathematics that go way beyond their scope - don't get me wrong - these are very significant and important theorems, both mathematically and philosophically, but most people draw a whole host of other (wrong) conclusions from them.This book puts it all straight - 'nuff said ;-)"
3,"OK board, poor compartment","It is a pretty board, but as others have noted, the storage compartment leaves lots to be desired. I bought another in Charleston's market a year or so ago. It is also cherry, also made in the US, but has a much better bottom compartment for the pegs. I wish they sold on Amazon!"
3,Good Movie,"The subject matter of this movie is a bit strong - it deals with a 13 year old girl who is very much interested in her sexuality but then gets taken advantage of by a much older man. Definitely inappropriate content, however, unfortunately this is a reality. Not bad, it finally picked up towards the end. If this subject matter is going to bother you, don't watch it. It was a little uncomfortable watching it and you can't help but feel really bad for her. All I kept saying to myself was oh my god, she's only 13!!!! I'm a fan of Peter Macdissi so I basically got the movie because of him. His acting was great and very much like a traditional christian lebanese father."
4,New movie!,"Everything was awesome, except for the fact that the middle thing that holds the disc in place was broken so the disc was sliding around in the box. However, thankfully there were no scratches and the movie plays great."
4,For those who take their humor black,"From the moment Thomas Newman's soundtrack opens the film, you know you are in the dark suburban underworld of Alan Ball. Much likeSix Feet Under, Towelhead explores dysfunctional family relationships as experienced through the eyes of a 13-year-old Lebanese-American girl.Many of Ball's familiar themes are present here - sexual awakenings, sexual deviance, abusive families - and as usual he handles the themes with an uncomfortable sensitivity. There are plenty of moments which you'd rather not be sharing with the troubled characters, but the film compels you to watch.The film medium perhaps suits Ball's subject matter better than TV. Where Six Feet Under often threatened to destabilize its credibility with the implausible bad luck that his central characters endured, Towelhead manages to maintain its focus, offering up a tenderly traumatic, and darkly humorous story of Jasira's coming of age into an increasingly sexualized world."
2,What is this garbage? It's no American Beauty.,"I only watched half of this movie. It seems to be nothing but a series of uncomfortable, uninteresting and pointless sexual scenes involving a 13-year-old girl. What was I supposed to feel watching this junk? Was it supposed to funny? It wasn't. Was it supposed to turn me on? It didn't. Was I supposed to sympathize with perverted, cruel, moronic classmates, parents and neighbors? I don't know how anyone who isn't at least one or all of those three things ever could. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least there were good actors in it. Everything else about the movie is a 1 out of 5 to me."
3,An Intriguing Film but A Horrible Message,"SPOLIER WARNINGI am shocked that no one else seems to point out the obvious. By the end of the film, the protagonist of the story, Jashira does not see anything wrong with having sex with Thomas... even though she is THIRTEEN YEARS OLD. Yes, this is an intriguing film. I did enjoy it at times. I get that it's supposed to be provocative and get you to think. However, I find her sexual relationship with Thomas just as disturbing as that with her next door neighbor... because at least with her neighbor she realized that something was wrong. Not once does she think that perhaps she is too young to be having sex, period. I'm writing this as a liberal NYC high school teacher. I just find it so sad that 13 year olds don't seem to have any innocence anymore."
1,This movie is SICK!!!!!!,"We had to turn this movie off after about 12 minutes. The writers of this movie are sick, child predators--don't rent/buy this movie!!!!!!"
4,surprisingly good!,"i never even heard of Cha-Cha, i only bought it cuz Juvenile is on it! but dang, she's pretty good! the song that really blew me away is ""Sunglasses""! that song is the bomb & then some! next one is ""It's like that"" with Juvenile & Trick Daddy. it only has about 3 songs that i do not like, all the rest are pretty hot. She's like a mix between Foxy Brown & Aaliyah. But she definately holds her own. P.S. she wrote all her own lyrics! (unlike some female rappers out there)"
1,hmmm,"i saw this album for 2 euro in a star and thought she was a great singer, turned out to be a rapper wich disapointed me... only the song with LaTocha Scott is good...the rest is &#$@"
2,I'll pass on the sushi,I'm not sure what this book wants to be. There's too little hard information to be a bluefin text. If it's about the fishermen; they come off as two dimensional. (The Perfect Storm was much better). I've only started the conservation section but that too doesn't seems to hold much promise.
4,Great Insight,"If you're looking for another ""The Perfect Storm"" or ""Hungry Ocean"" don't bother with this book. This book was written for the fisherman in mind - especially the Giant Bluefin harpoon fisherman. It gives a true insight of the highly fraternal and elite tuna fishing community in New England. Whynott gives the reader a real life picture of a handfull of local legends in the tuna fishing industry. In a race to fill the Government quotas, these blue water hunters ply the Atlantic for the elusive and lucrative fish that often weighs more than 800 pounds. An exciting page turner for the fisherman already familiar with Giant Bluefin Tuna fishing."
4,Very good...,"This text tends to be more Basic, than Advanced.... The title is Basic to Advanced, perhaps it should be Basic up to Advanced. Having said that, if you are not a nurse or are a student nurse, it is a good skill book and the photos are helpful. A couple of suggestions might be: 1) depict an oxygen flowmeter that has a graduated scale with a ball as an indicator and how to read that instead of the obvious number. (Not all flowmeters are like this, in fact most you will come in contact with are the ""ball in the column"" variety) 2) Show how to position the plunger in a syringe to get an accurate reading for medication administration. Accuracy counts!"
2,Required for class,"I'm not impressed with this book, and have actually hardly ever used it even though it is required. It has a lot of information, and some color pictures, which is nice, but overall it is just crammed together and kinda confusing to find anything."
4,book/service review,"The book was in acceptable condition when received. Although the book arrived on time, it was shipped late. Overall, happy with the book and the price."
1,What Happened?,"I did not receive this book!!! I contacted the seller by e-mail three times to check the shipping status and did not get a response. Thank you, Amazon, for not billing me! That would have been another headache to deal with."
3,For fanatical collectors (like me) only,"Peter Gabriel's CD singles normally contain some gems, particularly the remixes and B-sides found on the CD singles taken from 1992's ""Us."" But the CD singles from ""Up"" are more disappointing, this one in particular. You'll find only three versions of ""Growing Up"" here--the album version, a shorter radio edit that greatly diminishes the song, and an uninspired remix. Not worth the bother, unless you absolutely have to have everything he does."
4,Finally a Book You Can Judge by its Cover,"This books is called CHILD ABUSE PHRASE BOOK, and that is exactly what it is. I was hoping that it might provide me with words or phrases that might be helpful in other areas of my clinical social work practice, but, as it states, it is very child-abuse-focused. Some of the translations to English are a little odd. For example, in discussing confidentiality, the script for the therapist says, ""You can tell me anything. It's all right, I won't blurt it out.""I think this book is most useful for people who already have a good foundation of Spanish and just need the specific abuse-related terms. I'm glad to have it in my library."
4,Like most compromise tools...,"I bought this so I'd have both a corded drill with a 1/2"" chuck as well as a hammer drill. As most tools that are a compromise/combo, they don't neccessarily do everything well.For what I bought it for, the combo tool, it should get 5 stars. However, it you are looking solely for a large capacity drill or a hammer drill, look elsewhere. As a drill, it works just fine, it's just rather large and bulky. As a hammer drill, it's not as burly as the more dedicated units. It does do very well through soft materials like cinderblock and clay brick even up to 1/2"" holes, but it flounders in concrete as small as 3/8"".If you are like me and just wanted something that would be used every once in a while when that odd need showed up, this is a great tool. If you are looking for a dedicated hammer drill, look elsewhere.Know you needs before buying."
4,Reliable Hammer Drill,"I have had my Makita 2040 for close to 10 years. I drill concrete for anchors, bore holes for electric wire conduit etc. in concrete and drill safes many times a year. Some with hardplate and some not. I have been extremely satisfied with this hammer drill until today. While drilling a safe the bit caught and the hammer drill was pulled out of my hands. When I gained control again, it wouldn't work and when I squeezed the trigger it tried to turn and flames shot out the rear vents.I have used this hammer drill heavy for years so I am not too disappointed that I have to buy another one."
3,High on talent-Short on Music,"As a keyboardist who group up on Tony Banks (Genesis), Rick Wakeman (Yes), and Keith Emerson (ELP), I of course relished the chance to listen and critic this DVD. I already own Rick's other DVD ""Rick Wakeman Live"" and I have to say it is better. This DVD has some wonderful songs, but not enough of them (only 7 total). You can tell that the concert contained many more songs but were edited out. Rick of course was great, but it could have had some more songs. The sound (5.1) was good, but not stupendous. The video was good and definitely provided some good shots of Wakeman. Elenor Rigby was the best song showing Wakeman's dexterity and creativity. In conclusion, if you are a serious fan, you must have this for your collection. If you are mildly interested, you can get by without it and buy ""Rick Wakeman Live"" instead."
1,As if he needed another way to disgrace himself...,"It's not enough for James Dolan to ruin the Knicks and the Rangers. Now he has to go and try to ruin rock n' roll, too. Recommended if you like vanity projects by despicable human beings with too much money and too little talent. SELL THE KNICKS, JD!"
1,"The Blues Are Still Blue, So Don't Waste Your Time","I picked this album up after getting a free iTunes download of the album ""Right on Time."" Wow, what a disappointment. The sound quality leaves you wanting more, and Mr. Dolan's voice sounds like the album was recorded right after he got over the flu. In all honesty, I couldn't even listen to the whole thing, which is saying a lot; ""Right on Time"" is really rather good.If you're planning on buying this album, take a look at the reviews. They speak for themselves. Instead, snag a copy of ""Right on Time."" You can thank me later."
2,Will give the musician a headache-more ways than one,"This book has plenty of tunes,but presents them very poorly. The small print of the tunes and the placement of two on a page makes reading very testing for a musician. Also the chord changes on some tunes,the bebop tunes in particular,are wrong. This book is good for the casual player,but one who is looking for decent representation of the music should look into other sources."
2,Look other places first,"I have eight fake books I think, and this is the last one I reach for. The changes are not always right, that's my biggest complaint, but the presentation isn't that good, either. Warner Brothers publishes a 'Just Standards' Real Book that is my first choice. I like the changes and I like the presentation. If I can't find the song there, I check the Sher Music Real Books. The Sher Real Books are the standard, almost everybody will tell you that. Nice presentation, good song selection, the right changes. I also have a couple of books in the Jazz Bible series, and they're good but the binding doesn't lay flat easily on a music stand.I recommend that you check out the Warner Bros. or the Sher books first, you'll find that you don't need this book."
3,Fine if you are faking it.,"This book has an excellent selection of really great jazz tunes and standards. Like a lot of fake books and older sheet music, a few of the chords are either wrong or theoretically oriented in a rather bizarre context. Anyone who is trying to learn a song from this book should probably try to get a creditable recording of the song and double check the chords by ear. This is not an ideal collection, but in my opinion, worth the money."
5,The Ultimate Jazz Fake Book C Edition,This book crams a tremendous amount of music into one book. Is a great reference for anyone playing with a group or by themselves for that matter. I play with three others and they all have fake books similar to this one and we are constantly refering to them. A great source of music.
1,The lesser Wabi-Sabi,"How can two books with virtually the same title be so different? I bought both books that Amazon lists with ""wabi"" and ""sabi"" in the titles. The other book is highly informative, imaginative, and profoundly artful in the manner of wabi-sabi. WABI SABI: A NEW LOOK AT JAPANESE DESIGN, however, would be more accurately titled ""WABI SABI LITE."" It is a regurgitation of all the tired cliches about Japanese design and culture I have come to loathe rereading. Sorry. I'd let this one pass."
1,A pale facsimile of the real thing,"This book only skims the surface of wabi-sabi, dealing in the tired truisms of the ""cherry blossoms in the spring"" type and the cheap exoticism that often plagues Western writing about Japanese aesthetics.As a student of Japanese culture, I bought this book and was very disappointed. You're not missing anything--skip it."
5,VERY GOOD BOOK,I AM WORKING NOW IN LOCOMOTIONTHE BOOK IS A VERY GOOD START IN ORDER TO KNOW EVERYTHING IN THIS FIELD
3,Why is this not free?,"Princeton Press is shamelessly profiteering off of this text. This book is fantastic for understanding the physiology of muscles and should be required reading for anyone studying biomechanics. Most American scientific writing becomes public domain after a few years, consider Alberts' Molecular Biology of the Cell. Old versions (such as the 2006 version which is more recent than when this text was published) is free on ncbi. Not only is this text more than 25 years old, but McMahon died over a decade ago.I challenge the publishers to support the free distribution of no longer cutting-edge science and put out a copy of this for free on the web. It is inexcusable to be charging more than a modest markup beyond manufacturing costs at this point."
5,Great book !,Gave this to my son who loves everything about music and this was a hit at Christmas. He was reading it before the night was over !
3,not really as advertised,It wasn't what I would call 'good condition' - I had to spend half an hour uncreasing pages and the corners were quite battered
3,"Nice scent, a little greasy","I've never used shea butter before so maybe this is the way it's supposed to feel. It was a little thick and greasy for my taste. The kiwi scent is delightful, however."
1,"Unedited, Unreadable, Unbelievable","Dr. Richard Lert, not ""Dr. Hans Lert,"" was the long-time conductor of the Pasadena Symphony. He conducted Keel in a Handel oratorio (not ""aritorio,"" as is stated twice). When Keel was performing in London in the mid-1940s, ""Robert Donat dined with a lovely actress named Catherine Deneuve."" Ms. Deneuve was born in 1943. The first (U.S.) 3-D movie was not ""Kiss Me Kate,"" as stated, but was ""Bwana Devil.""I gave up halfway through when I realized that I could no longer trust what I was reading."
4,What a rascle!,"I always loved Howard Keel on film, but as he writes his story, he was a man who got caught up in the world of celebrity and not always living his life out as you would have hoped for him and the people in it."
2,Only Make Believe: My life in show business,"This book is poorly written. Obviiously ghost written, and not done well at all. Still, as a life-long fan, I liked learning a little bit more about Mr. Keel.Service from shipper was excellent. Book in good condition and came very fast."
4,GREAT HOWARD KEEL!,This book is good and easy to read.Nice memories about Howard Keel and his life for theclassic movies as well as for the modern TV series.Thank you for an unusual perspective of this late actor.Recommended!
5,What a great resource!,"From its unique plastic-encased cover to the excellent illustrations, this is a priceless resource. It's an entire bookshelf of reference books condensed into one book. I've been in printing for a long time, and I still picked up new information from this book. I'm going to add it to the list of ""can't-do-without"" resources that I recommend to training clients."
3,for a beginner..,i'm a big design book junky. i have shelves of them. so once you have all that.. you really don't need this one. it has little tidbits of design how-to's.
5,Amazingly handy book,"This is the ultimate reference guide for forms, folds and sizes. Just as the title says. It's a must have for any designer in print production."
5,GREAT,"This is a great book for graphic designers, and as a teacher i am, i think this will be a great book to recommend to my students, great general facts about the final process of design"
5,"Finally! A replacement for the ""Pocket Pal""",A great resource for all the little details you don't find in your design school text books. I've tossed my Pocket Pal and this is next to my copy of Bringhurst now.
4,Technical,This book is all numbers and technical specs and is very usefull for multiple applications. It is like a dictionary of printing information.
1,Way too expensive,Got what I wanted except the market is getting way too expensive! Won't buy again!
3,Going Someplace exciting?,"I picked up this book because I'm planning a long trip to West Africa and need a good travel guide. I found Jon Haggins' book to be VERY informative on preparations to West Africa and other places, but not on the actual destinations.This book is excellent for tour groups and for people who strictly want to stick with the tourist sites. However, since I'm traveling off the beaten path and doing the ""backpacker"" thing, I'm afraid I have to find another travel guide since there's no help in that area.I must say that the travels the author has done to South America, South Pacific, and Africa have encouraged me to do more traveling to exotic places."
2,What a pain,I used this a couple of times in the back of my truck and found it to be more of a pain than anything else. Even with all the space I have in the back of my truck it was not simple to put in. Now I use a bike rack that goes into my receiver hitch and it is much easier.
1,Cheap cost = cheap hardware,"If you're considering purchasing this item, keep looking. While it may work for some people the unit itself is cheap and looks terrible. The hardware (nuts and bolts) are totally the wrong size and type so much so that while attempting to attach the skewer to the rack, the bolts seized up halfway up the bolt. I had to use bolt cutters to cut the bolts to allow me to release the rack from my pickup. Additionally, the instructions are pretty worthless because they give you images of how it should look not how to assemble the unit.I've contacted Delta to send me the correct hardware because I don't believe I should have to go by my own hardware for a rack I just purchased.Spend a little more money for a nicer, better made product. This one is junk.G"
3,Horrible Hardware,"Like mentioned before, the hardware used to mount the two fork holders is worthless. One of the locking nuts froze on the bolt and would not even back off. Had to hit the local hardware store for some stainless bolts and nuts. Just intalled this yesterday and haven't had a chance to use it, but functionally it seems ok. I'm still not 100% sure it was worth $100 to replace my piece of treated 2x6 with three mounts screwed down to it, but we will see..."
4,Just what I've been looking for,"I have a m 06 Rav4 and the only option for a bike rack i had was installing a hitch. That is until I found this rack. It fits perfectly in the car, and is easy t instal. The bike is amazingly sturdy wen connected to the rack. Depeending on the bike size this will only fit one bike in my car, But it allows the bike to stand up leaving open more space for a bike laying down or packages.Now have to order the tire holder accessory.Directions are not the best."
5,Mounts perfectly in bed of my truck,"This bar fits nicely in the back of my Dodge Ram, even with a hard plastic liner installed. I regularly use it to transport two bikes to races and group rides. Really easy to use."
1,This book lacks true political thought.,"The Great Issues of Politics by Leslie Lipson is of no use to any person trying to learn more about political science. Lipson writes likes a philosophy teacher. His rambling ideas and wordy paragraphs make the book extremely hard to comprehend. Reading is slow and tiresome as you trudge through the text trying to follow Lipson as he attempts to ""psycho-analyze"" the history of politics. My Intro to Political Science class used this book as our text and stuggled the entire semester to make heads-or-tails of it. It made even basic political science concepts hard to understand. It wasn't until our professor brought in Understading Politics: Ideas, Institutions, and Issues that we began to understand our course. This book was wonderful. It was straight forward and made learning so much easier."
3,Insight into the Intelligence Community,"This was a informative book that outlined what Gertz thought was the reason Sept 11th happened. Though these were problems left over from countless decades of neglect to the intellgence community Gertz seems to protray this as the cause of failure. It is a combination af manyy things and to point your finger at one aspect of the pie is ludicris. The book does make a good point on how politics get in the way of policy. ""It is what you do and not what you say, if your not part of the future than get out of the way."" Stop pissing around and playing favorites and get the job done!"
2,"This book scratches the surface of 9-11,but avoids the heart","This book takes the 9-11 issue from the Bush Admin perspective of truth. Which would be fine if we didn't now all know that the Bush Admin. has been hiding and covering up the truth about 9-11. Even Republican, Shelby from Alabama, is outraged over Bush's unwillingness to tell America what he'd been.To understand what led up to 9-11, and Bush's suspicious behaviour regarding 9-11 investigations, you must read ""The War on Freedom"" and ""Forbidden Truth"" both available on [website].To only read this book leaves gaping dangerous holes in your understanding of possible Bush Admin. complicity in what occurred on 9-11, and their continuing stonewalling of a full independent 9-11 inquiry."
1,A Book Not Worth Paying For,"Thank goodness a friend passed this book on to me, for I don't buy books written by anyone who has spent his/her life in the depths of Rev. Moon's psuedo-religious/political cult. But one has to wonder why it is that Gertz is acknowledged by numerous experts in the Intelligence Community to have inordinate access to inside sources. Could it be due to his Master's vast, unexplained wealth and the impact that such wealth has upon the Republican Party and religious conservatives?"
2,Neoconservative propaganda.,"While Bill Gertz does an effective job at highlighting the miscues and mistakes of the Clinton administration when dealing with the potential threats of terrorism and handling of intelligence data in general, he totally misses the effects that U.S. foreign policy have had on terrorism. There is a long record of regime change instigated and in some cases, accomplished by the CIA.The Clintons didn't take advantage of oppurtunities to locate bin Laden, but to be fair, what have Bush and company achieved toward that end in the last 7 years?The author seems to have a positive view of the PATRIOT ACT. Intelligence at the cost of personal freedom and Constitutional liberty may be a fair trade for some, anyone that values the Constitutional rights of America's citizens will disagree.This book is more of an apology for Bush's failures by blaming the Clintons and other Democrats. It's neoconservative propaganda."
5,Lack of Intelligence,"Gertz has plenty of blame to go around but his major point is that decades of political interference in the work of the intelligence agencies and the bureaucratic inertia and political correctness of those agencies have rendered them largely useless. His conclusion that the whole intelligence apparatus needs an overhaul is inescapable.Gertz is able to make a lot of dry information readable,informative and troubling."
4,"""Breakdown"" not the right word.","It's been said before, in places as disparate as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and ... that the real failure which led to 9/11 is the failure of the intelligence brass to not care about appearing politically incorrect. All the facts were there, what was missing was the will to say okay, we're going to go out and round up a lot of Muslim males between the ages of 17 and 40, we're going to get negative press for profiling but to hell with it, we've got a job to do."
5,I love this book!,A great design reference for anyone interested in the history of television sets and production...plus a fun read.
5,What is this like and What is required?,"The Bible Studies in this paperback cover the book of Genesis well. Each study contains several kinds of questions: 1) Information questions like, ""What is Jacob doing?"" 2) Thought questions like, ""Why do you think Noah did that?"" And 3) application questions like, ""How should we respond when this happens to us?""Humanly speaking, such Bible studies depend on a number of things: 1) A group atmosphere where people feel free to discuss. 2) Some members of the group with solid Bible background. 3) A leader with a little charisma to keep people focused and engaged.I loved using this book and will likely use it again."
5,Awesome,"This is a wonderful Bible study. We are doing this study with a small group, and we are learning so much about our awesome God! This is a great guide, simple, easy to follow."
3,Slow beginning leads to climatic finish,"This is a book for Civil War buffs. The first half is interesting because it focuses on the raising and training of soldiers -- something not usually covered in other books of the genre. However, the author presents this material as a compendium of research tidbits rather than a story. The tale turns compelling and the writing more interesting when the Brigade meets its appointment with destiny at Gettysburg."
1,buyer beware,"this book was so marked up when i received i could hardly ready it. however, i needed it for a class so there was no turning back. when i tried to sell it back it was deemed unacceptable. so i an stuck with a book that i cant use as a reference and cant get ride off - looks like a library donation..."
4,good book,"Bought by accident, but good book nonetheless. I would buy if needed too for class, otherwise I don't have any use for it."
3,Through Women's Eyes Review,The book itself is interesting. I need it for a class and the topics that the book covers are very interesting. You learn a lot about what women go through in their time periods. It is very informative!
4,women's history,this book has great information of women history in the United States. Easy to read and understand. Good pictures all over the book.
4,Bravo!!,"I wasn't aware of this book until I took an American women's history class - I can honestly say that I would have wanted this book even if it wasn't assigned reading.Nearly every aspect of American women's history is (unfortunately only) touched upon from many nationalities. It opened my eyes to some aspects of women's history that I hadn't been interested in before and reeducated me in other areas. The book is littered with illustrations, photographs, maps, stories, letters, documents, collections of photographs to show what is written about, etc - all of which keep the text interesting and free of dryness.To make up for some lack of information, the end of each chapter has an extensive bibliography that steers you in any direction you feel the need to go."
3,Hard to read...,"This book was hard for my sister to understand (I ordered it for her summer school session). She said it didn't really help her much on the quizzes, etc."
4,Very good but could use DNA studies,"For over 5 years now DNA studies have shown the average white Jewish person is around 70% directly descended from folks from the Syrian region now comprising Syria, Lebanon and Israel! This means that the Jew of today usually directly descended from the people who lived in Israel in the time of Judas Maccabeus and before. Yet the author never refers to such important genetic studies to illustrate the Jews right to currently Israel. BTW the Falashas are not directly descended from the people who lived in ancient Israel. They are not actual Jews. This DNA studies show as well."
4,A Landmark Film,"This film was not the first sound film (in that film shorts with sound had been used prior to the Jazz Singer) and it is not all sound (only a small part of the Jazz Singer has sound). But this film was the one that set the world a buzz and convinced a number of producers that sound was the way of the future. If you like silent films, this film will hold its own as a story. If you like film history, you have to see this film, because of its impact on the world of film."
4,Great--but not the best--,"This album is a stellar showing of what may lay in the future of chamber music; An exciting and refreshing blend of bluegrass drive and classical sensibility. All of the players shine with the exception of one-- Josh Bell. He sticks out like a sore thumb. Having heard them live I can safely say that he devoted little or no creative energy into ""crossing over"" (unlike Yo Yo Ma in his performances with Meyer). His discomfort playing in any setting other classical makes him sound strikingly akward. I would highly recomend buying ""Uncommon Ritual"" before this album; I still enjoy that album, while I now find ""Short Trip Home"" hard to hear."
3,Short Trip Home,"I am sorry to say that this album did not meet my expectations . For such great artists there is a disturbing sameness to all the tunes. I listened to the CD numerous times thinking that maybe I am missing something but alas...like Miles Davis once said ""This is some boring s....""Sorry if I offended anyone out there and my apologizes to the artists."
3,"Not up to snuff, but still some entertainment","Portrait of a Killer was probably the best of the Crying Freeman series, understandably since it was the first. This book however, is not up to the standards set by that first book. The artwork as usual is incredibly realistic and stylized. The story is however pathetic. The villains turn out to be nothing short of perverts who like to kill and masturbate. It's still some fun to read, but in the end it is probably one of the worst Crying Freeman books ever made. If anything, get it for the artwork alone."
3,"Helpful, but there are better books","Drogin's work is considered a standard by many hobbyist calligraphers, but David Harris' ""The Art of Calligraphy"" is better. But Drogin is a good place to start if you can't find Harris."
5,Outstanding reference book on calligraphy,"Excellent reference book on calligraphy. This book avoids the useless fluff sometimes seen in such books. Calligraphy styles (and their history) are presented in a clear, concise and useful manner. This is a great tool for learning these styles."
5,This one was great too!!,"I loved Land of Loss too! The batt...err umm, I don't want to ruin it. But the beginning is super cool, and the Aztecs are very freaky. I really enjoyed this book, even if Christopher was somewhat whiny. Oh well, it was great!!!"
4,Wow.,"Okay, I was hooked after about two seconds into the first one so I guess it's no surprise that I sat down to read #2 in the library and didn't look up until I finished... over an hour later. This is a good book. Christopher (the narrator) is so scared that anything funny breaks the tension so badly that you just howl with laughter. For early in the series it's pretty darn good. And they just keep getting better."
4,good book,"The everworld series is a good one, but i'm afraid that the Animorphs books would be better because they don't have swearing. Swearing may add to the effect, but there are so many other things that they could say other than swearing. That is not what the young people of this generation should be learning. Because of the swearing in the book, i would say that it should be for people of at least 14 years of age and up. If you are younger then that you should read the Animorphs series. It's my favorite series!"
3,Going Nowhere,"Apparently we are never going to find Senna, each book will just add a few new cultures, and none of the characters will develop beyond the sketchy stereotypes we already have. I don't mind careless plotting or casual world building if I can have interesting characters and some decent dialogue and development. But this series is beginning to look like it's going to be a long slog to nowhere.Here's my recommendation. Read these first two volumes and, (if you find you're not into the whole series), then move on to the last volume to see what, if anything, happens to the characters.See you at ""Entertain the End, Volume 12""."
5,Ever wonder if Jesus really was the Messiah?,"Although the intention of this book is to argue a particular theory of the location of the Crucifixion of Christ, it contains much, much more. This is an essential book for a person wondering about who Jesus was, whether he could really have been the Messiah of the Jews, and whether any other ""higher authority"" such as the Diety Himself may not have left a witness to Jesus's authority and significance in the historical records of the Jews in the generation after Jesus. Buy this book, read it carefully, and use a highlighter pen to mark key texts for swift recovery later. In terms of content unavailable elsewhere (or at least hard-to-find) this book is worth about four times its price."
1,Oh Please!,"I was intrigued by the description of this book. It sounded like it had such possibilities that I just HAD to try it. However, I felt the author was just trying to impress us with his computer knowledge. I do have a working knowledge of computers (hence my interest) but, geez. How in the world do you expect your average Joe Blow to understand this?Sorry. I passed on the remaining 1/4 of the book. It wasn't worth my time."
3,Intriguing Millenium Concept,"This book was very original and entertaining. Despite being at the post-graduate college level, I did find myself bogged down by the computer science details. I did learn how to read binary numbers, though, so it was not time wasted. I look forward to this author's next effort."
2,"Good start, poor finish","I thought this would be a real winner. It has all the pieces of fiction I love to read about, Computers, Science Fiction, Archaeology and ruthless assassins. Unfortunately, the author never put them all together in a believeable or logical recipe. Also, the ending left me wanting, it was as if the author just gave up because he had enough pages written. I also cannot believe that the hacker could possibly go to jail for the heroines poor driving ability."
1,"great hook, poor book,","I was attracted to this book after reading a review that mentioned its ""countdown"" hook and eclectic Y2K/SETI/archeological components. But the book itself was tedious. Once it became clear that the characters were no more than cartoonish stereotypes, I lost all interest in what was happening. And what was happening wasn't much: the plot was formulaic and in great need of subtlety and humor. The author is also no wordsmith. Among other annoying habits, he is addicted to packing his nouns with stiff or hackeyed adjectives (""the tall and stocky operative"") that make the prose a constant uphill read. And did you notice? -- everyone in this book is ""seasoned."" Everyone. And I do mean everyone. This adjective is so overused, one of my few joys in the book was to play the game of waiting for its next appearance. (If you're going to read this book, it might be fun to do an actual ""seasoned"" count. Better yet, if you haven't read the book, my advice is: don't.)"
2,I could have been a contender...,"The information on the Mayans is interesting, if true, but the overall story is so cartoonish that I am not quite sure if one should believe it. The story hangs together by a thread and is poorly written. How does the Japanese couple from South America fit in? And more importantly, why? The ending? No wonder there was an epilogue. The editor did a disservice to the author and to the buyers of this book."
2,Confused...,"What is this book? A mystery? Harlequin style romance? Science fiction? Suspense? Who knows... Certainly the author doesn't appear to know. There is nothing that the main characters appear to be incapable of. They ""outsmart"" the Mayan culture and in the process reduce the intellectual abilities of the people to that of a computer addicted ten year old. Unrealistic emotional reactions to events (sorry I'm not going to elaborate since you might actually want to read it.) predominate.The first half of the book is the best. Before you read it, open it 2/3rds the way through and write...""and they all lived happily ever after""... Stop when you reach that point. Only then will it be worth your time to read... I did enjoy the first 2/3rds."
4,fast read and not what you would expect,This book was a fresh take on the y2k issuse we are facing. The author presents an exciting twist and it shows that he did his homework. This book reads like a fast paced Tom Clancy novel. You might want to wait for the paperback because you go through the book so fast.... your left wanting more....especially considering the price of admission.
3,"Good story, interesting detail","I usually don't read mystery/suspense type novels, but I picked this book up on a whim, without any prior knowledge of the story or the author. The story line was interesting, and I especially enjoyed the detail on tracking computer viruses and on pre-Columbian Mayan society/thought. I found the ending to be a little unsatisfying, but overall, this is an enjoyable book."
4,Very good book about what might be 010100,I picked up this book because I deal with the Y2K computer issue every day. I decided to see what a fictional look at the new year would be. I think the author did a great job in this novel. I like it enough that I have started reading all his books. 010100 was the first one I had ever picked up by R.J. Pineiro and since then I have read 3 others and look forward to the rest. This book was a great read and I found it hard to put down. GREAT JOB R.J. Keep up the good work.P.S. I also loved Y2K.
1,Disappointing -- don't waste your money,"Piniero starts out with some interesting ideas, but fails to create a book with a coherent plot, or believeable characters. His run-on sentences, uni-dimensional characters, and many inaccuracies make the book hard to read. Descriptions of Mayan culture (particularly its calendar)are novel for most readers, but better described on several web sites. The mix of computer hacking, archeology, Russian spies, the FBI, and radio astonomers is not coherent. The graphic violence does not move the plot along. The inaccuracies and improbable events are so bad, they are actually humerous. I got tired of reading in the middle of the book, whereas the author seemed to get tired and just stopped writing at the end."
4,"If you're into computer programming and Mayan civilization, this is for you","I thoroughly enjoyed ""01-01-00"" because I was interested in all of the aspects pertaining to the plot and subplots. The computer lingo may be a little over the top for people with no familiarity of computer science, and the archaeological explanations might be overboard for those not interested in history. Overall, though, Pineiro does a pretty good job of weaving the past and the future together for the novel. The ending was sort of strange, and one minor theme bothered me throughout the book. At the same time, however, I realized that it made sense due to the timing of the novel."
2,Great First Half - Hazy Finish,"R.J. Pinero caught my attention with Y2K. I really enjoyed the ""down-to-earth"" way he crafted a technology based concept into a really good book.So, I bought 01-01-00 with high expectations.At first, perhaps because I'm in the network security business and actually know one of the key characters, I was intrigued, even a bit excited. It really promised to be a great read.Even when he began to inject the Mayan angle I was fascinated. Hey...""Chariots of the Gods"" made the premise almost believable.However, I suspect he just got tired of writing and took the easy way out with a surreal ending that left me cold. Too bad. He really has a knack.O.K. R.J...let's see what you've got!"
3,Fans of _Contact_ (the book!) should enjoy this novel.,"Take the basic premise of _Contact_, add a liberal sprinkling of violence and two heaping cups of Mayan themes and you've got _01-01-00_.Without spoiling the book, I was a bit dissapointed the direction ""the message"" was taking as it was unraveled. It didn't seem to fit the technophile/hacker/mathmatics angle of the novel.If you enjoy cryptoanalyis, computer viruses, hacking, terrorism, and a bit of South American religious mythology then this is your book."
2,no title,What started out as a terrific read just totally disintegrated at the end. Computer expert meets archeologist in Mayan ruins to unravel virus prior to new millenium. So disappointing.
2,Disappointed,"Maybe, as a history buff, I'm getting used to more interesting presentational formats of history. Perhaps that's why I found this book, generally, to be a very boring exercise in reading something. I was disappointed."
2,Cheap and Faulty,"Was looking for flashlights for power outages and for lighting when working on the back of the computer (connecting cables, etc.) and these seemed perfect. However, one didn't work at all, and the switch on the large one wouldn't return to the off position. I'd advise you to spend a little more to get something reliable. Returned for refund."
4,Difficult but important,"Human beings are deeply psychologically attached to nature and the sooner we realize that, the better off we'll be. Why are houseplants so popular? Why do so many children's books feature animals as main characters? Why do more Americans visit zoos than sporting events? Why are so many of us worried about rainforests we'll never see firsthand? Unlike the previous two reviewers, I hold that our ties with nature are deep and ancient. We can bury them under concrete but WE CAN'T CUT THEM. As a last word: most of the really happy people I know have a deep relationship with nature or something from nature, such as a pet."
4,cool look,The lamp itself looks cool the problem is the shade isn't long enough and you can see the light bulbs when sitting next to the lamp.
1,Welcome to the Wonderful Whirling World of WAP,Don't get me wrong. This is a 5 star book but before buying this book please be aware that this book is about the WAP 1.0 specification while the most recent version is 1.1. Because of big differences between the two specifications I would recommend buying the new version of this book based on the WAP 1.1 specifications as soon as it comes out.
3,"Official, professional and difficult reading","The book is very informative and professionally put together. It covers all aspects of WAP. In general, computer books and manuals are not easy to read! Ditto this book. The language and examples are not simple or easy to understand."
2,this doctor novel moves too slow(BORING) and no aliens !!!,"There is no aliens in this book for starters!!!The plot involves the russian revolation and rausptien(sp?). It moves at a snails pace .I would only buy this book if you are fan of the author and like stories like the Doctor Who stories""Black Orchid"",""The Crusades"" ,and ""The Aztec"" otherwise skip this missing adventures. Maybe next time the author will give us some aliens or alien invasion instead. Please Next time you write do something more sci-fi like the fans will like you better for it!!!"
2,Slow and plodding,"This book is extremely hard to get into, and goes very slowly. The main characters are very boring. I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,"Cute, but not worth the price","While the theme and colors are adorable, the set is not worth the price. I bought the set, which includes bumpers, not realizing that you are not supposed to put bumpers in the crib with the baby, as they increase the chance of SIDS. You're better off just buying the sheet, quilt and valance separately. I bought all the matching things for the room, (hamper, mobile, lamp, border...etc.) and it is ADORABLE, but I just wished I wouldn't have spent my money and the set.."
1,not recommended,"I'm a residential builder/remodeler. Bought one of these new about 8 years ago for 600 bucks. It has had pretty light use and died on me a few months ago. Took it in for repair, 50 bucks later used it for 5 minutes and it died again. Took it back for repair and they determined it needs an armature, field and controller- about 350 bucks to repair it. I can buy the parts and do it myself for 250 bucks. So now I'm torn, do I fix it and hope it lasts or bite the bullet and spend another 600+ bucks for a new roto hammer. My Dad was a commercial contractor, he has a Hilti TE72 (bought it in 1981 or so) that we used and abused and it's still going strong. So I'm bummed with this Makita and doubt I would buy another chipping/hammer drill from them. I didn't purchase this through Amazon but at a local tool store."
3,remind you of anyone?,"[now before i start i would like to say that i am only rating the song 2. Debonaire not the whole album].i heard this song on the scream 3 soundtrack. it's not a bad song, don't get me wrong, but does it remind you of anyone?exactly when did Marilyn Manson re-name his band dope?"
2,Marilyn Manson clone?,This would be a really good album if Marilyn Manson hadn't already done it. These guys have talent and they decided to use it on their new album Life. Life is a much better album. Anybody that really has an inclining for goth should definately pick this album up. You will probably not be disapointed. Otherwise check out there second album.
1,"Please, someone stop Dope from making another album!","This has to be one of the worst albums I have heard in the last few years. This band want to been seen as really shocking (e.g. an ‘edgy’ band name, NWA cover, lots of swearing) but they just don’t have any of the personality or substance to make it work. If you like Marilyn Manson, Ministry and NIN, and you crave for a third rate version of these bands, then you may get some enjoyment from this CD, but don’t expect anything in the way of innovation, and don’t get me started on the two classic songs this band have covered and ruined."
4,Bonus track...wha?,"So I got this CD, and I love Dope and all, but where is my bonus track I was promised. I bought this CD SPECIFICALLY because I love Dope's ""You spin me round"" remix. So I open the cd when it arrives, throw it in my CD player, and immediately go to track 14... or I would have... if there WAS a track 14. So I said ok, maybe it's hidden with another song. I listened to the whole CD, all the way through, and there was NO extra song... I WANT MY EXTRA SONG DANGIT!!!"
3,Dope-Felons & Revolutionaries,"5 weeks ago I hated Dope (basically because I didn't know what they sounded like) but then I got bored and sampled some songs off Amazon.com of their new CD, Life. I really, really liked it so I went out & got it. A few weeks later I got this one for my birthday... and I must say it's pretty damn good. Not Life good, but still good. Sounds kind of like Marilyn Manson, a trait Life dosen't really have as much, and that's basically why I don't like this one as much... anyway, if you're going to buy a Dope CD, buy Life first, then get this.-Nicholas"
4,Not as bad a some of you make it out to be . . .,"Ok. This is no Black Sabbath, we all realize that, but if you ignore the politka, and just take it at face value, it's pretty good. Dope is just hard music with little else to offer. Nonetheless, what it offers serves its purpose well. While I can find some good hard music that offers good lyrics too, I enjoy Dope's unprompted, directionless anger. Plus, you must admit that Dope's cover of Dead or Alive's ""You Spin Me Round (like a record)"" is just great. That's my two cents."
3,Musically fine but...,"Just plain boring, and I don' know, this might be personal but I hate the way this album was recorded, it's much too flat, like every instrument has tuned themselves to the same level in everything. They have good ideas musically and lyrically but maybe the guy should revise the verb sing, what he does is alter between crude chilling screaming, to monotone flat talking. seriously it sounds like the guy is talking to himself most of the time! Buy this album if you're into that sort of industrial but I'm not so I didn't like it. (This is more of 2 1/2)"
5,steven,hi my name is steven and this tape is hilarious laurel and hardy are always the best and may the best comedy team live in our hearts forever.
2,no elastic strap .. as described in other review,"I usually buy a red OR black, hard cover, Twin Wire, 192 page, similar dimension notebook from Staples for about the same price, but it has a MUCH DESIRED elastic strap to keep the notebook closed in a backpack -- or keep turned open to a specific page.This item DOES NOT have an elastic strap as indicated in another review.:sigh:Had I known this certainly beforehand I would not have purchased it. For those who are interested it can lay flat -- either splayed both hard covers on one flat surface, or hard cover folded under thanks largely to the Twin Wire.I shall not buy another one."
3,upside Dowm!,"As many reviewers comment: This notebook has quality paper and design. However, the company should have enough quality control to put the front cover on right-side-up!"
5,great notebook,like the hard cover for support when writing. use these all day long. substantial paper. convenien size. good price on these
4,Great in the dark,"If you need to see the time in the dark, this clock will do the job. But if you want precise time you will have to adjust it regularly as it is a little fast."
2,Warning,"The title of this release would lead you to expect a performance of Rossini's Stabat Mater as he scored it: soprano, alto, tenor and bass soloists, chorus and symphony orchestra (led by a conductor). What you actually hear is an arrangement for a small wind ensemble - no singers, and, despite the citation, no conductor. This wonderful piece is made far less interesting by such a reduction. Besides, the performance is pretty ragged. Unless you are unusually enthusiastic about wind ensembles, you should save your money."
5,Any Former USAF Pilot Would Devour This Book,"This book covers all the aircraft I ever flew as a USAF experimental test pilot. From fighters to bombers to cargo aircraft, any former pilot should be able to find the one aircraft he specialized in. Extensive photos in color show all the aircraft in their most resplendent designs. The author has done an outstanding job of capturing all milkitary aircraft in the fifteen year period described. Fred J. Ascani, Maj.Gen., USAF, (Ret)"
4,"Self Reflecting, Intense, and Exciting","This book encompasses the experience of a personal journey. A journey that, for some, is inevitable. The struggle to resist, survive, and love are ultimately the components of every man's life or dream. I found the book to be a maze of doors that unlocked the vital essence of the fool/Lazarus. The Divine Devil, the Emims, and Zahra all bring one to recall and question his/her calling in life. The responsibility to find sight once blinded and the true meaning of life is awesome.DeAugust's creative colorful coupled with his intense flavor is definetly a keeper.Prepare yourself for the journey!"
4,Bargus,These are very-well made and exactly as described. The price was great and these are worth every penny!! My only complaint was that they didn't come in different colors.
5,UTG shotgun high cap magazine,This is a great magazine for an airsoft gun. It works great with absoultely no problems.
2,"High capacity, but prone to break","Ive had to order 3 of these for my remington tac 1 airsoft gun. The mag works for about 6 months and then breaks. What happens is the turnwheel breaks witch pops the spring out of place , then its rendered useless. This problem has occured with all 3 of the mags. All in all, I spent as much money as a good sniper rifle on these magas. So if your looking for a mag that you replace every 6 months buy it, but if your looking for a sturdy, and durable mag dont buy this!!"
4,A World of Ice,"This is definitely a specialty book describing a world of which few of us are aware yet in various ways affects our existence. I am partial to this book because it describes the incident in Greenland when my father was killed rescuing downed airman in 1942. That notwithstanding, arctic duty is every bit the battle that is faced by men in the trenches. It is an interesting and enlightening read, I do recommend it."
3,Not Wilde about Lily,"Although a well put together CD, and a great vocalists, Lily Wilde lacks the spark necessary to make these songs stand out. The arrangements are blase and her singing sounds restrained and lacks the energy that could have made this a stand out CD."
5,I love this album.,"I live in Oregon and am a swing fan (I have 20+ swing albums). I coworker let me listen to this album and I was hooked. I was surprise to find out that Lily Wilde is a local artist. I'm not much of a concert goer, but I've tracked down her concert schedule and am looking forward to her appearance at a local pub in August.If you like swing music sung be good female artist then I think you might really enjoy this album. This is definitely on of my favorite albums. Heartily recommended!"
5,Kudos for Taproot,"I thoroughly enjoyed issue number 12 of Taproot. I was especially taken by a piece called Sepia Afternoon, written by Michael Atzert. I thought its elegant imagery truly captured the magic of a memorable romantic interlude."
4,The Near-Ultimate Highlight reel,"If you saw everything that happened from December 1997 to June 1998, don't waste your money. This video barely touches on Sting's earlier career. It simply focuses on the 7-month time frame when he was the biggest wrestler in any promotion"
3,"Good, but not great.","I love watching the video when it first came out in the late 90's. In retrospect, the video was good, but not as good as others. After watching Ric Flair's collection and seeing some of Sting's earlier matches, I wish they had included more of that. Overall, I would recommend it to die-hard Sting fans and if you are in the mood for some classic 90's wrestling action."
5,The Sting video is awesome it is a must buy for a sting fan,The overall goodness of the movie is incredible! is a must buy for sting fans!!
5,Witty and a perfect extension to the game,"First off I want to say that the art fits the style of Devil May Cry perfectly. The balance of horrid darkness and fight sequences made it all the more enjoyable.Dante's personality doesn't stray too much from what you see in the game, befitting his opponents with witty humor that will make you laugh at times yet soon encasing you into moments of blood and gore that will keep you on edge. The story is very interesting and kept me from putting the book down which I love in manga's and novels. I feel like although this happens pretty far from what we see in the game it still embodies the basic idea that lead up to the games beginning; being that Dante mentions ""It's been over a year since we last met"" I'm assuming this was the year previous to that moment. This book is definitely something a Devil May Cry fan would love to have and it's worth every penny."
2,A STORY OF SHOOT THEM UP,"2002. Written and directed by Sun-Woo Jang. Korean movie about virtual reality. Ju enters a game called ""Resurrection of the little Matchgirl"". If he wants to win, he must kill all those who want to buy a lighter from the young girl. Appalling. For videogames maniacs only."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this CD twice and both times they were defective. It was like the disks were blank, nothing to read. This is one of my favorite pieces of music but I don't want to try to order it again. Amazon was really great about refunding my money quickly. No hassles with the returns. Thanks Amazon."
3,"Beautiful performance, terrible SACD","Simply, this piece is performed wonderfully. All the resolution you'd expect is there in the recording. The downfall of this SACD is the overwhelming hiss throughout the disc. If this had been a ""red book"" disc, I'd be more accepting of the flaw. When I pay extra for a SACD, I would like to get the best sound SACD can offer. This hiss should have been removed in the processing portion of the Disc's creation. It is a shame."
4,Chicken cooker,"Works great, cleans up nicely. Would have given a 5 star if grease tray was a little larger."
4,best chicken,"Makes some juicy chicken. The product does tarnish, but I didn't intend to have it on display"
1,Why?,Why would you buy a 25 dollar beer can chicken set up? You can wash a beer can and use just it. Or you can buy a 3 dollar stand at any hardware store and a drip pan at the dollar store. I believe some people have more money than brains.
4,Works great but it's a little messy on clean-up,"I've always felt it's probably a little unsanitary to use an aluminum beer can with inked labeling on a hot grill. Maybe not, but it gives me pause. This device works as a more stable and possibly more healthy alternative to a can of Bud. It is also perfect if you want to use other liquids such as wine, juice or whatever. The only downside is the clean-up. It consists of four parts, each of which get coated with chicken drippings and need some serious scrubbing to get off the cooked-on residue. I've found a dishwasher alone doesn't really remove all of it. A little scrubbing is necessary to really get the device clean.This is certainly a useful item for us backyard cooks. It's a little inconvenient compared to using a beer can that can be tossed in the trash after using."
5,"Tender, juicy, and delicious every time!","My family bought me a Weber Smokey Mountain smoker for my birthday (April) this year. The first time I used it I made beer-can chicken, turkey legs, and a pork roast.Everything was delicious!This beer-can chicken rack is easy to use and fairly easy to clean. What matters most is the chicken -- and it comes out tender, juicy, and delicious every time!Couple of things to consider:1.) While I generally like to drink Sam Adams, Bass Ale, Guinness, Blue Moon -- I prefer Budweiser for the beer-can chicken2.) An excellent web site for smoking/grilling tips and recipes is virtualweberbullet.comEnjoy!"
4,Beer can chicken rack,"the drip pan is awsome, it keeps all the grease and juices from ending up in the grill. The cup is a nice feature, you can use a beer can or the cup with wine or any liquid you like.It also cleans up well."
2,careful!!!,The holder for the beer can(or other liquid) has a sharp edge. It is difficult an you must be careful. The rack fits very low on the drip rack. It is also difficult to clean since you must clean between the supports.I would recommend a cheaper model that is more functional.
4,Great little cooker,"This was given to me as a gift and at first, I thought, what will I do with this? Well, it turns out that the beer can chicken cooker cooks a perfect, golden chicken every time. The bird is seasoned, moist and evenly cooked. The drip tray prevents grease spills. THe only negative comment that I have is that the can lid can be difficult to remove once heated. I don't use the lid anymore."
5,The Drip,"Love the drip pan. don't underestimate the just how usedful this is. I've use mine mostly in the oven, so prehaps I get more drippings with slower cooking. The top of the canister is a bit hard to get off most of the time so I just left it off and it seems to work fine!"
3,it's okay.....,"i used this ""beer can"" chicken holder the other day. it works as described. Complaints are: The lid for the metal ""can"" is VERY difficult to get off. it sticks. Also, the chicken can make the whole thing tip over. The bottom tray does not hold alot of liquid, so if you have a juicy chicken, put it in another pan. The product is okay, maybe a gimmicky thing, but it works."
5,Beer Can Chicken Barbecue,This was a gift for my son and his wife for Christmas. They have not had the time to use it yet
3,Not bad,"I purchased this one because of all the good reviews. It is decent and would get the job done for sure, but it is not as good as the Norpro Stainless Steel Vertical Roaster. I returned this one and kept the Norpro."
3,Beer can chicken,"I like his rack. Etter than others previously tried, as it is sturdier and has the tray as well as the container for other liquidds."
5,I like it,"The product is great! It makes cooking, ""beer butt"" chicken a breeze, I guess the terminology depends on what liquid you put inside the container. It creates a very juicy chicken. The only negative comment, if it is indeed negative, is that I feel the handles should slope upward more than downward to aid in ease of grabbing to pick up, especially with gloves on. I modified mine slightly by bending them upward just a bit. This is the second one I have purchased. Nothing wrong with the first, I just needed to be able to cook two at a time.KT"
5,good soulful read,"This was recommended by a therapist and it is a good read, even though it can be dense. It will change the way you live too, not just help with the grieving process. Highly recommended. Also, I ordered this used, and it came in immaculate condition!!!"
1,This cd is numbingly repetitive,"Im sick of bands like this. The lead singer bitches about his past and the vocals sound like they were recorded with mouth wash in his throat. This band needs to take music lessons from industrial bands of higher talent like NIN, Marilyn Manson, Skinny Puppy, ect."
5,Dope is the best band out!,"I highly reccomend getting this cd, I have been a fan for a while now, and they are my favorite band. They dont really sound like any other band they are themselves.They dont copy the MTV bands like Limp Bizkit, KoRn, or SlipKnot. Every song is great and heavy on ""Felons and Revolutionaries"". I recently got to see them live and they are so nice to their fans. Much better than bands like SlipKnot and Limp Bizkit. They dont hide behind masks. So listen to Dope and go out and get their album, it's the best one I have!"
2,Nothing special.,"This is just a Re-hash of early Marilyn Manson, and people who have convinced themselves that this is nothing like Manson are just plain BLIND. There is really nothing groundbreaking in this band, just another wanna-be band. The only thing I like that this band ever did was the cover of Dead Or Alive's ""You Spin Me Round"". And that isn't even on this cd."
2,Weak,"Dope's Felon and Revolutionaries is nothing, but a WEAK Manson. It is WEAK hardcore music and doesn't even match Korn. The guitars are mediocre, as well as the lyrics. If you like hardcore or metal there are better CD's. Not Recommended."
1,waste of your money,"this cd is a waste of money. im not saying i dont like hard rock and metal, but all dope is is making a louder voice than anybody else and screaming. when i bought this cd i thoght that they would have loud parts in their songs like korn and limp bizkit, but all dope cares about is noise. i cant beleive that all a band would care about is noise. if i were you i would never even want to even think about songs from dope."
2,pretty lame,"these guys aren't original at all. They sound EXACTLY like Marilyn Manson ""Antichrist Superstar""-era and the more I hear them the less I like them. Just a stereotypical metal band that old people talk about (""You can't understand what he's saying"", ""He's just shouting ""F**k you, f**k you""), which is true, in the first track, the only part that comes to mind is a blatantly dull chant of ""F**K YOU! F**K YOU!"" Oooooh that's very big and clever ain't it? There's no intelligence in the lyrics or music and it all seems like its been done LOTS of times before. Only a couple of songs worth listening to: ""F**k Tha Police"" and ""Sh*t World""... is all the swearing needed? Maybe its to cover up the fact that they are talentless.Probably a good live band, a very dire band on disc."
3,"It's ok, but should be better","These guy's were so awesome live with Static-X that I went out and bought the cd. The entire cd uses some sort of voice distortor that makes the lead singer sound like he's singing underwater or something, it's really bad. Had they not used that silly voice distortor the cd would be so much better, as is, its just annoying."
2,not so dope,"the problem with this album is that the songs start off good and end up tedious and a tad too second hand.the riffs however are strong and intense lyrics are in their favour,all they need to do is come up with something more inventive and cutting edge.they have a long way to go,but have the talent to get there.just too dull."
4,...PURELY DOPE...,"...The Dope brothers unite to bring forth the hard-hitting 'Felons And Revolutionaries.'Dope represents all that sets hardcore apart from alternative. Hard, loud, filled with energy, deathly growls, thick distortion, and furious drumming. Dope's debut album is nothing less than impressive and i am not disappoint to any degree. From beginning to end, 'Pig Society' to 'I am Nothing' Dope gives a great performance.Recommended..."
5,Check it out,"overall a good cd. not particularly awesome, but something to keep you busy listening to. ""Sick"", and ""Kimberley's Ghost"" are my personal favorite songs, but all the songs are pretty good"
4,Should've been heavier,I saw them on tour with Slipknot and Coal Chamber. They were good so I decided to buy the cd at the show. I was slightly dissapointed that they don't sound as heavy on the cd as they do in person. The songs are still good though.
2,Just get some old Manson...,"... because that's exactly how these guys sound. There is nothing at all original here, just a re-hash of ""Protrait Of An American Family,"" only not as good."
5,Love Poems from God,"""Love poems from God"" is a must book to keep by your bedside, and read a poem or two (or more) before sleep. For all ages and faiths, the poetry will make the spirit rise with hope and joy."
5,Only the glorious duties of light ...,"It might be tempting to give in to enthusiasm, to say: ""Ladinsky has done it again!"" But the truth is: he hasn't done it again - this time he carries us thoroughly past his previous endeavors, inviting us all to dance in the ""glorious duties of light."" (St. John of the Cross) Through these 12 saints and mystics, he throws open the doors to ectasy and drenches the reader in a sort of spiritual sensuality that our souls must hunger for across the ages.With the broad range of poets he's chosen, the reader gets a lesson in cross-cultural ecstatic passion. ""...Don't forget love; it will bring all the madness you need to unfurl yourself across the universe"" (Mira) and ""...Every cell in us worships God. Every arrow in the bow of desire has rushed out in hope of nearing Him"" (St. Thomas Aquinas)Immerse yourself in these shimmering drops of passion and ignite the longing that is God's only gift. Take your civilized clothes off and dive in ... ecstasy awaits!"
2,TOO NEW AGEY AND A HUGE MISREPRESENTATION OF POETRY,"I was very disappointed with these poems. The chapter about Turkam felt very disrespectful in my eyes. Ladinsky should have sold this book as one of his own writing's, instead of the writings of the saints he has chose. Even though I know for a fact none of these are authentic, Ladinsky in the most part is a good poet. But a horrible translator. Buy at your own risk."
5,The Wind Will Show Its Kindness,"A manborn blind can easilydeny the magnificence of a vast landscape.He can easily deny all the wonders that he cannot touch,smell, taste, or hear.But one day the wind will show you its kindnessand remove the tiny patches thatcovered our eyes,and we will see God more clearlythan we have ever seenourselves."
5,A Very Profound Meditative Reader,"This is a collection of poetry by people who are very much in love WITH god. The choice of poets is excellent—Rumi, Kabir, St. John of the Cross.... This is not a book for reading cover to cover. It is one to pick up from time to time, read and brood over."
2,Disappointing,"I read Mr. Legge's review below before purchasing this, but decided he was probably just a Christian offended at Ladinsky taking liberties with some of the great poets/writers from this tradition. Unfortunately, I wish I would have listened to him.I have trouble believing that these poems, or even something similar, were written by the sources credited. They all come off sounding a bit like Hafiz, (or at least, as I'm beginning to suspect, Daniel Ladinsky's version of Hafiz), but not nearly as good as the Hafiz translations in Ladinsky's other volumes.Something about the ""translations"" just seemed a little smart-alecky to me and not very deep. I don't think for instance, that Kabir really said ""a fish in the water that's thirsty needs professional help."" Buy at your own risk."
1,Ladinsky flogs his work on the reputation of others,"Yet again, a book by Daniel Ladinsky rides on the coat-tails of other, much more gifted writers. Ladinsky doesn't translate these poets, or even provide new renderings based on previous translations - as he himself admits, he writes poems which he believes to have been divinely revealed to him by various famous writers and poets from previous centures, revelations which bear no relationship to anything these writers produced while actually alive. Funny how they all come out sounding like a twentieth century American."
1,Twelve great voices reduced to one,"Ladinsky's choice of poets for this volume is inspired. All twelve write with clarity of image and meaning that works across time and religious divides. All speak at some time from a experiential place of ecstatic love. So why do I give only one star? Read translations then compare to these adaptations. What Ladinsky gives us is one voice - his. The differences in place and time and religion of the originals have been flattened into an English-speaking present. The stark clarity of image in the originals have been muddled into blurred images of modern interpretation.While it is true that the ecstatic experience of love is common across culturals, the language in which the experience is described is always the unique voice of a particular individual's experience of the divine. It is that particularity that was lost in these adaptations.Rather than this volume, seek out translations of the originals."
5,"Besides a great read, a wonderful course book","As a teacher of a class on spirituality and aging in a social-work college, I find this book a wonderful way to introduce practical-minded students to their own inner voices."
4,Love is good,A wonderful collection of spiritual poetry from world wide sources. A good addition to his other books on this topic.
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!,"I don't remember how this book first came into my hands, but I am so grateful it did!! I've been reading a couple of pages almost every morning for a year and a half and have given it as a gift to several people, and each has been similarly grateful. I enjoy reading a little about each of the poets themselves and just love the poetry itself. I can't recommend it highly enough!"
5,good tips regarding wild and garden plants,"This is a beautiful book, both in the quality of the photos and the depth and readability of the information within. Perhaps its greatest strength is that it covers both native plant species and cultivated garden plants. This book is enough to convince any parent of the wisdom of edible plant gardening, and to shy away from the deadly, flashy ornamentals."
3,its more for a coffee table then a field guide,"this book will do better on a coffee table then in a backpack. the list of plants are.. well your not gona see a adult eating enough to get poison from. maybe little children thats about it. author has good info in the front about type of poisoning & what to do. she/he also explained why so many thing are listed as poison even tho a lot of them are not poisoness. if you got some friends coming over to drink, this book will bring up some funny conversation. other then that, not very useful."
