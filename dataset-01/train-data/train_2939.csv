3,"""You Call This Love?""","If murder and childbirth go together this may be your book! It gets bogged down in too much of the character's (Delaney Roberts) every thought and pain with the murder being almost an afterthought. However, young Mothers will no doubt love this book and they will live the story along with Delaney."
5,"A fast paced, upbeat mystery.",I was very impressed with Deborah's smooth writing style in this contemporary mystery. Her characters are believable and the story moves quickly!
2,"Shots are too distant, but okay for watching while cycling","If you are looking for an exercise video that motivates you to exercise, buy the ""Sexy Cycle Treadmill"" tape instead of this one (same producer, similar theme). The Treadmill tape has better closeups of the girls (always very close to the naked girls during the entire tape). But in this Cycle Workout tape, you follow the naked girl riding a bike while in a camera-truck, so some shots are close, and some are not. If you use an exercise cycle at home, and you need motivation from fantasizing about riding your bike with a naked girl, and watching the country-side scenery, then this tape may work for you (the naked girl does have a nice behind). If you are only after naked girls, look elsewhere (such as the Playboy videos). You will never see this tape on cable tv (and you have never seen these models/cyclists before either)."
4,"Very Impressive, even from an opening band....","I saw the Riptones perform as the opening band for Los Straitjackets almost a year ago and happened to enjoy The Riptones more than the headliner. I bought ""Buckshot"" that night in hopes that it just wasn't the alcohol talking and that the band actually had talent. Well, they did. With exception to the widely agreed-upon sludge of their so-called ballad ""Yvette,"" all the other songs show so much experience and deliberation. The Riptones don't give you too much by elaborating on guitar or bass solos, but leave much to how well they perform in concert. If I had to categorize the group I would have to say that they are a mixture of Brian Setzer, Queen, Dwight Yoakum, the Big Bopper, and The Ramones. I hope I didn't short change the group, but that's the impression I get after listening to the disc well over a hundred times! Please check out ""Buckshot,"" it's guaranteed not to suck!"
1,Is this for REAL??!!,"I'm not normally one to offer musical reviews...I like what I like and I've never been concerned with the 'style' of music or who is performing it. But THIS!!! While I'm sure that the music is lovely and the vocals are adequate, I find it difficult to accept that this a Lillian Axe creation. It does not 'rock', it does not 'inspire', it would NOT prompt me to check out ohter Axe material. It is however, good for a laugh, and laughter is a good thing. That, plus the clever title, garner one star or maybe 1/2 of another, from me.....(and the hope that someone will read this and tell me that it IS a joke!)"
2,Color comes out too dark.,"I had used dark brown briwax already. So looking to get a lighter color ordered the Tudor brown. The Tudor color came out much darker than the dark brown. I found that the consistency of the dark brown was a lot more controllable. You could spread it in varying degrees of darkness. The Tudor could only be spread dark and appears streaky. This may be the perfect color for some. But, be warned the color label can be deceiving."
4,Prayers for Today,"The prayers included in ""Running with Jesus: The Prayers of Malcolm Boyd"" are written in a contemporary style with 20th century langauge. Boyd hits on real life situations when a person can be in their darkest moments. It shows how prayer can be expressed in the depths of despair as an open dialog with God. He touches on several different aspects of life sincerely and honestly. His prayers show the importance of communicating your true feelings regardless if you are going through unpleasant times or the mondane.I found myself in his writings. This book showed me how prayer can improve your attitude. He wrote things that I have felt but was too ashamed to express to anyone let alone myself. He also showed me the importance of letting God in during these times. It was refreshing to read prayers written in the darkest of times that were still respectful and praiseworthy."
2,not what it seems,"The large print version has a background color,type and type color that works well. The recipes are too complicated with too many ingredients for a person who is legally blind. Therefore I would not recommend it."
3,large print receipes,Easy to read for disabled people...Receipes are slightly obscure....Recipent not that happy with receipe selection... Love the spiral book....Should show sample of receipes included....
1,"I Ordered this Product Twice, Paid $4,899, and Never Received It!!!","I ordered the Surveillance Bundle originally on 3/6/08. Paid $2,445.14 on University of Michigan credit card. Received it on 3/11. It was a box with one camera. Returned item, received replacement, same thing. 1 camera in the box. Spoke to agent. Told the item was not available and I would receive a credit when the returned items were received by Amazon. Also told to wait a ""couple of days"" and order item again. Told it would not be available until the problem had been fixed in the warehouse. Ordered item again on 3/19/08. Charged another $2,445.14 on University of Michigan credit card. Received 1 camera. Returned 3rd box to Amazon. No Refunds have been received as of 4/7/08. Ordered the Surveillance Bundle from someone else. Will never trust Amazon again."
1,Unusable,"The cork screw is covered in a black material, presumably to protect in shipping, but we're unable to remove it. Consequently, the item is unusable. An e-mail to the company has failed to get a response."
4,"Rock solid, one complaint","This saw is rock solid, absolutely no vibrations and plenty of power. The blade change is quick an easy and the stand is very sturdy. I own a cabinet shop and I use the saw for cuting intricate corbels. The saw works great. My only complaint is the dust blower. It doesn't blow hard enough to remove the dust away from the pattern lines. I worked with the bellows to get more air flow but was only slightly successful. To much of the air leaks by at the bellows and not enough goes to the tube.Other than the blower problem, I would put this saw up against any of the top brands. If you don't need the 30"" throat there is no reason to pay the extra for other FAR more expensive saws."
3,Not too bad,"Quality of the cards were not that great but if you were to use in a classroom setting, it probably won't last that long. But then again you can always make you own. The straws were not as sturdy as I thought they would be too. Easily bendable and it leave s a mark."
5,Wonderful!,"This was the first meditation tape I ever bought, and though there have been many since, this is the one I always return to. I am a highly stressed person, and this tape helps me gain focus and calm down. Deirdre Griswold's voice and technique are are unmatched. My six year old also uses this tape. It has taught her methods of calming herself without my intervention. A great tape!"
4,Exactly what i needed.,Less expensive than many others out there. It served my purpose perfectly. I would recommend if you just need a guide for bottom of your sliders.
3,Falls Flat,"This is a frustrating book. Graphically, with its numerous vivid, full-color photographs, it is quite striking. Textually, though not poorly written, per se, it is bland. Moreover, even though surveys are seldom ground-breaking, Lowden's ideas strike me as ones that are not his own - he seems in thrall to reception theory. The area of Byzantine art about which he does seem to know more than most - illuminated manuscripts - gets more coverage than it probably deserves. (Then again, Lowden is described as an illuminated manuscript expert on the dust jacket of the book, so perhaps his indulgence is understandable.) In short, and despite its now unfashionable approach, David Talbot Rice's ""Art of the Byzantine Era"" still stands in my mind as a better-written and more enduring short survey of Byzantine and early Christian art. Lowden's work is much better graphically, but he lacks Rice's flair and ability to express his enthusiasm for his subject."
5,Beatifull performance,"I saw this on a public TV brodcast in my home country of Guatemala when I was 16 or 17 years old, and I just fell in love with it. After a lot of searching around I was able to find this beatifull preformance here, after16 years I get to experience it again.Thanks."
3,"Nice, but not great","The colors on the reproductions are okay, but not stellar.In order to preserve the aspect ratio of the originals and not leave out any details, the paintings are reproduced on plain white glossy postcards. This method leaves a lot of white space on the postcards and makes the art quite small.The postcards themselves are not of high quality; they are not as stiff as most cards, and feel more like paper than paperboard. Detaching them leaves an unsightly ragged edge. The backs do not have appropriate markings for postcard addressing, though of course you can still send them as postcards without too much effort.Unimpressive, but given the price, you can't expect much more, and people love getting postcards of any quality."
4,Death the unanswered question,This book was terrific to read. It was to the point and answered and it shed some light on the subject on the death that everyone should know! The author is an incredible witness and a wonderful person!
5,Incredible book!,This is exceptional. Life changing book. Read it... it will change the way you do things. It will make you a better person.
2,started out believable,"this book started out believable, but then became unbelievable. It's a Revelations type of book and I ended up feeling like the the writer of the book is a bit off her rocker."
1,Author is Mormon,I was researching the author of this book and found things which said that she is mormon and in a polygamist relationship. Also that she wrote the book 8 years after it happened and revised it years later.
3,Not overly inspiring,"I generally find these books very inspiring, but had trouble with this one. Don't know if it was the bland writing style or I've read other NDE books that I felt were more based in truth. I'd recommend ""Return from Tomorrow"" or ""The Message"" before recommending this book.Return from Tomorrow"
3,eclectic.hermit reviews afterlife,I've read many afterlife accounts written by the people who claim to have survived them. This book stacks up a little better than any I've read yet. The problem with this book and these experiences in general is that there is no way to prove they actually happened. One wants it to be true. If you can suspend your doubt long enough to read the entire book you will be blessed with a positive upbeat biography of a woman who has over come abuse and risen to a level of self acceptance worthy of any literature story. I would like to meet Sarah and shake her hand for a job well done.
3,Not One of My Favorite NDE Books,"I just did not resonate with this book. I found that it focused too much on the negative - horrific catastrophes, evils & hells. And, quite frankly, it just didn't ""feel right"" to me as I read it.It's important to recognize that our experiences are influenced greatly by our beliefs & filters, and we don't all have the same ones... So, what doesn't feel right to me, may feel o.k. to you..."
5,A Wonderful Book,"I've read several books by people who have glimpsed the other side, including the one by Ritchie which I believe started the genre. (It's also an excellent book.) I found the book inspirational and enlightening.Sarah clearly came from a dysfunctional family background, and by her own admission, did a lot of self-sabotage of relationships and life in general in her earlier years. However, her NDE (near death experience) helped her put things in perspective, and gave her insights which allowed her to see a much more complete picture of life and its challenges. While some books tend to focus on pushing a particular agenda, Sarah is content to simply share her experiences without the need to preach to the reader. Her calm, thoughtful sharing of her experiences and insights gave me a greater perspective on some of the events which have touched my life over the years. I'd highly recommend the book to anyone, religious or not, who is trying to put life into perspective."
2,Good. At first.,"I wish I could fill this with great info. But I can not. The best I can say is that her story of such horrible trama and struggle to find an answer is an inspiration. But the nuclear wars and all this Salt Lake City referance and death and distruction. Wow. I don't know. I won't pass judgement. I will just say that I put the book down half way through and have no desire for any further reading. And I read a lot of nde. Good and bad. This one will not be recommended. An awesome book is Howard Storms testimony titled ""My descent into death"". 5 stars. Worth every second of my life. Read that."
4,Very Enlightening,"I read this book at the recommendation of a friend. I'm not sure if my friend read the entire book or was just shown the most important points. I fully understand the need for the background, but I did feel a need to skim it. The description of her time on the other side was amazing. If what she says is true, I am enlighted, excited, and scared."
5,Incredible Book!,This book was given me as a gift and I have passed it on and purchased more to share. Her ND experience was more detailed than most I have read and is life changing for anyone open minded. I want to make this a re-read each 6 to 12 months.
2,"Nice Photography and Scenery, Not Much Else!","Apparently this movie never even had a theatrical release and went straight to video since there is not one review of it on Rotten Tomatoes, at least at the date I'm writing this. That's probably as it should be because it's unfortunately just not a very good film. I caught it on Starz and am glad I didn't pay $10 bucks to see it at a theater. The photography is quite good, the scenery nice (even if it is the Santa Barbara CA area masquerading as Vermont!), the acting adequate but the plot line and script are both predictable and unbelievable especially in the last half of the film. It's a movie that I really wanted to like but just couldn't warm to! Shame on the producer's brother for his over-inflated review (more a shameless plug!) of this definitely mediocre flick!"
2,Synthetic Music,"I bought this CD because I love world music. The quality of the CD is fine, but it is all synthetic music. It all drones on in the same monotonous way. If you are looking for real world music, skip this CD."
4,4 stars,"Hmm. Just setting up the premise takes an awful lot of time. Suffice it to say that the heroine decides to pose as English nobility in order to secure guardianship of the child of a friend who's died, and to accomplish that, she gives her savings to a man she met first playing poker in a cheap tavern and later in the house of her wealthy employers being introduced as an English duke.There's a bit of a My Fair Lady flavor, though she's the one who instigates the transformation, and a nice twist that I initially suspected, then decided I was wrong.Entertaining, and different enough to make it worth the read."
3,MONOTONOUS AT TIMES---,Typical historical romance with a predictable outcome and a My Fair Lady twist. Too much repetition made it a bit monotonous at times.
5,A boon for recycling ...,"This is one sturdy newspaper holder. It is a bit heavy to move around, but I forgive it for that because the thing holds a ton of newspapers and is virtually indestructible."
1,The Worse Book I Have Ever Read.,"I find Jungian analysis interesting however this book is the most hateful book towards women, and fat people that I have ever read. The author has the most hateful attitude towards anyone that has any weight problems. She uses all the worse stereotypes towards people in these predicaments to forward her ""theories"" which ignore everything scientific about the human body. I guess in Woodmans world, we are all supposed to be stick thin and if we are not, this means we are psychologically disturbed. I think this author somehow felt morally superior to the women she was writing about. The horrible thing is she had case studies about ""obese women"" and they averaged ONLY 160lbs! Shocking. A sad disaster of a book. A hate manifesto disguised as intellectual enterprise."
2,A little bit behind the times,"I hate to be the contrarian, but I bought this book hoping to get some real insight into the product. I was a bit dissapointed. The examples in the book are not at all ""wild"". In fact, they seemed rather basic & simple. The web has advanced at a rapid pace & rainbow gradient graphics are as dated as stick figure ""under construction"" gifs. The book was a good primer for understanding the tool, but offered no real insight into advanced use & tricks. I went through it one time & learned all about the toolbars. I haven't touched it since."
2,Some poor welding and design flaws,"Got this mailbox quickly, and was expecting to have the same quality as in the Architectural Mailbox I had just ordered for my home. This was to be a PTA mailbox to be installed in a school corridor.When we mounted it to the wall, the lid would not open! Should have had a different style hinge, as clearly this box is designed to be mounted on a wall. Had to place some washers behind the top screws to allow clearance to open the lid. Then, noticed that the weld on the back panel of the mailbox is bad and the back is separating from the side. Would probably return, but it is already up, and extra keys were made."
2,mailbox,"A metal box. For this price should have more credible lock. Besides, nobody needs another key to lose: combination dial lock is essential, and, missing"
2,Leaky (though stylish) Mailbox,"I ordered this mailbox for it's great classic looks and sturdy construction. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that it would make my mail wet and crumpled. I live in a very rainy area, and the rain somehow always gets inside and gets all of my mail wet. Plus, the way the slot is situated, the mailperson always ends up jamming all of my mail into the slot and it gets all crushed. I was better off with my old clunky, ugly, but effiecient box. Now, even though the front of my house looks better, I have crumpled crushed wet mail."
4,Sturdy utilitarian mailbox,I am really pleased with this mailbox. It is sturdier than I expected it to be and it will hold a good deal of mail including large/oversized magazines (the slot is large enough that large pieces do not have to be folded to insert). Keep in mind when choosing black that dust/dirt will show easily.
5,"simple, yet very functional","When I received the mailbox, I asked my husband if he liked it and he said, ""It looks like one of those boxes for syringes at the drs. office!"" I laughed and do have to agree, however, it is functional, and is large enough to hold all magazines and large pieces without ripping or tearing anything. I did not want anything too obtrusive, we just built a porch on the front of our home and the mailbox is not supposed to be the focal point, as a matter of fact, I hung it on the back of a column and it blends in perfectly. It is solid and very clean looking which works perfectly on our Colonial style home. LOVE it and would recommend highly!"
4,Locking Mailbox,"I feel more secure now that I have this locking mailbox. For the price, I am satisfied.One thing you may want to keep in mind is which side you will be approaching the mailbox from. I didn't think about it - and when I open my front door, I'm on the right of the box. Since the lock is on the left side and the mailbox's door opens from left to right, I have to take a few steps outside to get the mail. Not that big of a deal for now, but winter is coming and it may be really annoying."
4,Great mailbox,"Looked long and hard for a lockable mailbox that could handle a few catalogs or a box of checks (yes I still use them to pay bills via snail mail - old school style!). This one was just the ticket. Roomy enough to handle today's seemingly daily load of junk mail, but not so large as to look like an industrial fire hose cabinet. Hinged lid protects the mail from getting wet and is easy to open/close. Large mail slot allows for bigger items, including padded envelopes and that box of checks I mentioned. I mounted this puppy onto brick and it was easy - drill four holes and pop in some plastic anchors and screw the box to the wall. (Just remember to use a masonry drill bit if drilling into brick/concrete/stone/tile). Came with two larger size keys which is nice. Box is sturdy and lock is good - not flimsy and cheap. Finish is very nice and looks to be quite durable. All in all I'm very happy with this mailbox."
3,Early Steve McQueen,"Early Steve McQueen flick, starring the son of John Barrymore, the late John Drew Barrymore, father of Drew. The basic plot has been told many times and much better than here. It is two childhood friends who grow up and find themselve on opposite sides of the law. The movie was based on a popular best selling Harold Robbins' novel and was the first to be turned into a movie."
3,Not the greatest Peck film,This wasn't the greatest of Peck's western ventures; just okay. It was a typical army-shootout-with-indians movie with the last-man-standing theme. I found myself spending more time guessing about the succesion of characters killed off rather than the plot. Didn't consider it a waste of time - I'm an admirer of Gregory Peck's work and am glad I saw it; but not the most memorable film.
3,"Not great, but not that bad","Folk renditions of classic American folk and blue... Not the best, but a good mix and interpretation of some beautiful songs."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be...,"I purchased this item to store my loose-leaf Tea in. The stainless steel is beautiful and also very functional. However, the plastic threads on the mouth and lid did not meet my expectation of German design.If you don't position the lid PERFECTLY it's not going to go on straight and you will have to try again. Plus the plastic thread insert in the steel lid is beginning to pop out on mine. In addition to all of this, the plastic used seems to be very rigid, but not very strong. Each time I take the lid off, I find tiny shavings of the plastic in the threads. This means there is also most likely plastic shaving in my Tea. Although this poses no health risk, it is high on my scale of ""stuff that shouldn't happen in a product.""I'd recommend this product for storing non-food items only."
3,Looks good but......,"I searched a long time for these. I bought 6 of these canisters for my counter top to hold sugar, flour, pasta, etc. thinking it would provide for easy access and look nice at the same time. I agree with the other reviewer about the difficulty in perfectly aligning the lid with the container in order to close the canisters. In addition, 3 of the plastic thread inserts in the lid part have delaminated from the lids and are stuck on the canister portion. That however makes for ease in closure since you can just shove the lid back on instead of twisting. There are also tiny plastic flakes from the lid that are now mixed with the contents of some of the canisters. Overall, I like the look and will keep them, and they are more convenient for me only because if I didn't have attractive containers I would keep them in a cabinet."
2,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I actually bought this movie on a whim because it looked cool at Wal-Mart. The story sounds pretty interesting so what did I have to lose, right?This movie is complete and utter boredom at it's worst. Now, imagine a few teenagers reading lines in the woods and running around pretending to kill things. THAT would have been more interesting than this was. Don't get me wrong; I think they had a decent story to work with but the execution is just horrible.Do yourself a service - save your money and your time. You will have more fun picking individual fleas from your pet's fur.My copy currently resides in a landfill somewhere. I'm giving it two stars but that's probably nicer than I should be. However, they took the time to film it right?"
1,wow... just bad,"The movie was bad....I love zombie movies... and especially movies that make you think.The back of the box reads nice. If only its content lived up.It was dull... long... ultimately boring. Horrible effects, and im not saying that like unless it had a big studio behind it its not up to par... but i would have settled for cheesy old Romero make-up. The acting is bad... apparently all roaming mercenaries with chips in the backs of their necks have mohawks.... and the main character.. its been a while i cant remember if he was deaf or mute, but wow bad acting... like cheesy mexican soap opera bad... *insert Pablo Francisco joke (MARIA!!)*"
1,No immediate noticeable effect; too expensive,I tried one jar of this product but did not continue because I didn't see any noticeable effect and at the price I wasn't willing to continue for six months to see if anything happened. I have found that Perricone's Alpha Lipoic Face Firming Activator gives me a noticeable and immediate improvement in appearance. But this one wasn't worth it at one-half or one-third the price.
2,Bleeps over important content,"The book attempts to provide a practical perspective without getting into nitty-gritty details of the theory behind error correcting codes. This limits its usefulness of you wish to understand FEC codes and how they work. Worse, its practical treatment has gaps as well, and one is left without the understanding that's needed to fill in the gaps. I went to study the C program for BCH codes in the companion Web site as well: its represents a sparsely commented ""point solution"" for a very specific code of short word length and is based on sophisticated methods that, while no doubt highly efficient, are only very thinly treated in the book. This makes it very difficult to understand what the program is doing, let alone to generalize it to other flavors of the code. I have found Shu Lin's and Daniel Costello's book ""Error Control Coding"" to be much more useful."
2,Mediocre,"I fully agree witht the previous reviewer. In an attempt to make things look simple, the author forgets that the objective of a good technical and engineering book is not to be just a cookbook for your kitchen where there are no deep whys, but to make the reader actually understand what is going on under the hood. This book fails completely at this, assuming you can reach the end survyving the frustrations, you will not remember the rationale for any single step taken.A much better choice if you really want to understand the subject are Blahut's and Todd Moon's books."
5,200 pages of practical ECC,"This is a cookbook, as some of the above readers have commented. 200 pages that tell you what to do if you want to get something up and running. It is just what I wanted. What's wrong with that?Coding/Information theory is a fascinating topic. I enjoy studying it. Incredibly complicated though too, and if you want to learn about algebraic geometry, extreme value statistics, information entropy, etc. you need a stack of 1,000 page thick books. Some days, it is fun to curl up on the couch and study this stuff. If this is what you want, maybe you should look elsewhere. But, on the other hand, if you want to get an interleaved RS/Viterbi communication link(as I did) or just about anything else working in a hurry, this book is just right."
3,Santa Cruz Barbecue,"Bong rippers unite. The new sound from the band sweeping the Bay Area will have you dreaming of yummy surf, fish tacos and cold cervezas. While not overly complex, OPM's sound is a mixture of revitalized ska and a hint of more traditional Bay Area sounds like Train and Stroke9. Don't expect to be moved to a higher level, but be sure to keep this CD handy for the Saturday barbecue with friends."
2,WORTH BUYING IF YOU LOVE THE SINGLE OR TRENDY PUNK ROCK,"I first heard OPM's song ""Heaven Is A Halfpipe""2 weeks ago and i just bought the CD. Its got some cool tracks, they're hip catchy and trendy-reminds me of the reel big fish album""turn the radio off"", but not as nerdy. These guys are cool to listen to in the car with your buddies, or to put on when skating or something. This album is NOT special, this type of record has been put out before by other bands, but it's still catchy, and with a skit where a dude is smashing a coke machine, and screaming profanity it's worth 15 bucks. So why not? Sing along to the mindless lyrics, have a good time-in ten years this stuff will seem mindless to you too..."
1,Please help us,"This album is a perfect example of exactly what is wrong with the music industry these days. Just when I thought music could not get any more tired and derivative, this album comes along to reach new heights of mediocrity. Everything here has been done so many times by so many other bands. The music, the lyrics, the attitude (or lack thereof) - all so weak. The truly sad part is that I have no doubt that this band will be huge. Yet another in a long line of ""LCD"" (Lowest Common Denominator)bands that rule the airwaves these days. Please help us."
1,kinda crappy,this cd is probably the worst cd of its genre i hated it. it sounded like the were tryin to hard to be original and have no talent
5,Best of Genre,"I'm 51 years old, and can't quite bring myself to love the rap genre, the only thing my son listens to. OPM is quite the refreshing change; Real drums playing great grooves. Happy songs, even if they, like their brethren, Kottonmouth kings, focus a bit much on drugs and alcohol, it is still lyrics that are friendlier than run of the mill hood rap. My favs on this CD are Capitan and Dealer man. All the others are good too. I'm hoping to work up a couple of these in my classic rock band, I know it will get em dancin'!"
2,Not so good,"This album is not what I tought it would be. If you want some real good Californian Reagge, Rock, Punk, Ska, HipHop then buy some of Long Beach Dub Allstars album instead, they are key! And they play real instruments!"
4,a nice suprise,"really i should hate these guy,but i can't.this is down to one main reason they make very good music.very mellow sounding and relaxing,like a the fun loving criminals except good.some of their songs don't work though(stand up 'stash up') but on the whole they do a pretty good job of crossing genres which is somthing lacking in american music these days.oh by they look out for bonus track 'war on drugs' its a wee gem."
5,Woah.. This CD is off the page,"Man.. Right from the off, with Stash-Up this CD is a treat. Bouncy lyrics which stick right in your mind. Stash up is a great opening to the song followed by the smash hit Heaven is a halfpipe.. The song that clinches it for me however is Undercover Freak. This has all the qualities to be a hit over here in the UK and so I hope it gets released. Overall this CD is well worth your money and it'll keep you listening to it for a looooooooong time to come"
2,OPM stands for other people's music,"OPM's debut album borrows from virtually all styles of music: latin to rock to rap. They are a band struggling to find their identity. Tracks like Heaven is A halfpipe, El Capitan will no doubt be hits especially among the Kid Rock fan base. Once you get past these songs however you find yourself lost in a mish mash of twisted music that hardly makes any sense. Latin choruses to songs that start out like rock songs and lyrics about being drug pushers, smoking weed or drinking whisky hardly make a classic album. It seems sad to say but OPM will clearly be another one hit wonder band that gets lost in the ever growing wasteland of alternative rap."
3,Wanna be Sublime...,"I checked these guys out cuz they cited Ozomatli, Jane's Addiction, and Fishbone as influences in a recent interview. What's not to like in that combo? Turns out they do play some tight cross-genre music, even if you get the sneaking suspicion they're Sublime's kid brother band. If they keep maturing, OPM could be a lot more than a bizkit of the month."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"While the music content was fair, it was not as complete in depth as I would have expected. The quality of the photograpy was very poor,as the lighting was inadequate."
5,what a win!,"charming prose and beautiful artwork, a winning combination. ms. gibson serves another bounty of beauty that is fast, easy ,creative and fun to work with. a fine feast for body and soul. i look forward to seeing what ms. gibson serves us next."
2,Disappointed,Not up to the standards that I have for Megan Hart. I have really enjoyed every other book by her.
4,If it was a snake it would have....,"Always you is the story of life long best friends who have supported each other through thick and thin, the good and the bad, UPS and downs of relationships...never realizing, well, never admitting they were attracted to each other...all that "" don't wanna ruin a friendship if things go wrong"" blah, blah,digress, and the attraction becomes unavoidable....blah, blah be damned. Always you is an easy read. It had relationship dilemmas, personal dilemmas, great love scenes ( hot love Scenes), and a HEA. YOU won't be disappointed with it's addition to your romance collection. (3RW Team Yellow Review)"
5,Mezmerizing,"I am not an authority on Jazz, but I do love good music and this CD is fantastic, the songs are uptempo, exciting, innovative....just mezmerizing."
4,Bela Lugosi - his rise and fall,"I am a huge Bela Lugosi fan. This is a very well done and interesting documentary. Yet, I find it hard to watch becasue I love lugosi, and am hurt to see the hard road life was for him."
3,chip clip,These items are often sold in packs of 4 or 5 thus should only be $5.00 or less. One of the larger bag handle/ clips broke the first time used.
3,Clips aplenty,"Lots of choices in this collection. I wish there were more larger ones and fewer tiny ones, but all in all it is a worthwhile set."
3,A little disappointed...,"I picked this disc up after Bossa Brava 3 and was not quite as happy with this purchase. Bossa Brava 3 is a great funky gumbo of salsa and acid jazz. This #2 is close but falls short of the more recent album. After listening to this one for three days, no songs stick in my head like several from number Bossa Brava 3 have."
3,Scanning the Skies - A somewhat disappointing history,"By and large, the author has succeeding in drawing together a lot of information. However, it appears to me that she has drawn most of her understanding of the history from a limited list of participants in that history. Because she is not a meteorologist herself, this lack of thorough research leads to her characterizations being rather flat. This is not a bad book for those interested in the history of our science, but it is not a definitive work on the subject."
5,Gotta have em all!,"Bizarro! episode was my favorite but I bought seasons 1-4 and have enjoyed everyone of them equally. Besides, if you buy Season 1 and you laughed then buying Season 2 won't be too far out of line. However, if you bought seasons 1 & 2 then what's stopping you from finishing it off and buying 2 more seasons?"
5,Surprise! It's Awesome!,"I hesitantly got season 4 thinking that the last season probably trailed off and knowing that Harry Goz wasn't in it. I was pleasantly surprised with an awesome season. Sealab went out with a bang . Captain Shanks really came to shine in this season and became just as great a character as any other. Many shows try and fail at outrageous over the top cartoon comedy but sealab is among the few who do it so well it makes it look easy. ""Legacy of Laughter"" was a great ending and made me sad it was over but happy that it happened."
4,Sealab is funny!,"Well... its kinda slow... I wouldn't recommend purchasing this unless you've already seen a few episodes... but if you're a fan, of course the DVD would be the next best thing!"
1,This a terrible end to a good show.,"Sealab 2021 use to be one of my favorite cartoons on Adult Swim. The first two seasons were the best and the third was acceptable. Yet the fourth season on the other hand was a sad ending. For this use to be a show I loved, but disappointed me in few ways.The writing was terrible, this season is devoid of the same humor from previous seasons.The character ""Sharko"" was annoying to say the least.How I wish Capitan Murphy was still around, but I am not even sure he could have saved this total let down.After this season I can be grateful they pulled the plug. Sealab 2021, I will miss you..., but not season 4.P.S. If you enjoyed the old Sealab 2021, I suggest you check out their new show ""Frisky Dingo""."
2,$14.95 for a xerox copy with a glossy cover.,"The information in the book is good. It covers the advanced Katas of the Tomiki Style of Aikido. The cover was nicely done, but the book itself was horrible. The photos look like the original manuscript was done on a xerox machine. They were grainy with little or no contrast. Gray blobs is more like it. I have one of this authors books on the Basic 17 Hon Kata. It was much better. If you can't find information on the advanced kata anywhere else then bite the bullet and buy this book. But be prepared for a disappointment. It looks like a book quickly done by a college professor to make a few bucks. Kind of what I saw a lot of in my days as an assistant in the Physical Education department of my university.Keith PattonNidan, Fugakukai Aikido"
4,very nice,"This cd, like many, focuses on the Wailers prioe to their mega successes and showcases their raw, yet undeniable, talents.The rude boy, rocksteady, and very early reggae sides chosen for the cd show that Bob had a very forceful (and even somewhat untrained and uncontrollable) voice that meshed well with some of the tougher, more rude boy songs, and a calmer, smoother voice that meshed well with the many love songs he penned.A very nice collection that is well worth listening to."
5,Belleek Harp Shamrock Tea for One,"I purchased this item as a first-time Belleek piece for my niece. As with all Belleek, it is delicate and beautifully designed. The teapot is a good size for a single serving of tea, and the cup is delicate & easy to hold."
3,good but not great,To be honest i was kind of expecting more from these guys. I guess its pretty hard to follow up tyranny with an even better disk. Its ok but nowhere near as good as tyranny which in my opinion was a masterpiece.
2,Expected much more from this talented band,"After their first three albums I expected a lot out of Shadow Gallery's fourth album. Maybe that's my problem with this album -- I went in expecting WAY too much. Each of their three previous albums showed growth and maturity over the prior albums. Legacy, on the other hand, feels like no movement forward for the band or - worse yet - a step backwards. It's like they took their tried and true formulas and spun out a new collection of songs that are creatively and stylistically indistinguishable from their previous works.I've been a fan of Shadow Gallery since I first heard their self-titled debut and I'll continue to support them (hometown boys!). I'll buy their next album when it comes out. I just hope that they haven't run out of steam after Tyranny. Legacy won't spend a lot of time in my CD player alongside other Shadow Gallery works."
5,Fontella Bass In The 1970's !,"A great soul CD by Fontella Bass. You must look at this as not like the Rescue Me years and the like she recorded 1965 through 1968. This is a bit different take for her.Still soul but with more than the sound-a-like Motown sounds her producers wanted then. It is just as good,different,and very enjoyable. I loved it !"
2,"Simple Step, Great for Beginners","As far as getting a workout with this video, it could happen, but you have to get past the insturctor's voice. I could not. The routine was very simple and very predictable - 8 on the right & 8 on the left. It is very easy to follow. I was disappointed with it because I was looking for more complex choreography."
4,"High in protein, low in cholesterol and tastes ok.","High in protein, low in cholesterol and tastes ok. I had a problem with my shipping address but the selling company was quick in solving it. Good communication."
4,"Very good, high quality protein that is easy to mix","This protein is of the highest quality from Allmax. I only buy isoflex because it has Glutamine built right into the protein complex so you definitely have less muscle soreness after your workouts. It also has 97% of whey isolate, which is very pure for a protein. As said in other reviews, it mixes VERY easily. The powder is very fine and doesn't clump as much as other products (like EAS 100% whey).I only give 4 stars because I am a water + protein mixer and do not like the taste of the strawberry. I have tried all of the other flavors and would give them 5 stars (especially choc mint) but the strawberry is lacking somewhat. I'm sure you'd get a richer flavor with milk but as I said, I usually only have access to water as a mixing agent. 5 stars for sure if they made it a lil richer!"
2,Flavor Not My Favorite,"I was hoping that this flavor would have tasted more like a Creamsicle. Unfortunately, I only taste chemicals. I would definitely go with the peanut butter and mint chocolate chip over this product any day."
4,Happy,"I bought this protein because of other reviews saying it doesn't cause bloating. Well, they were correct. This is good stuff. I will buy it again."
5,"very interesting, eclectic and hard-driving album","Idan Reichel is probably the most interesting musician working in Israel today and one of the more interesting anywhere. His ""project"" brings together a movable feast of artists from many different traditions. When I saw him perform last year in Washington DC, the lineup included an Ethiopian and a South American singer as well as some of his regulars. Reichel with his dreadlocks looks like a Yemenite rasta.The result is a hard-charging sound with lyrics in Hebrew, Arabic and Amharic. The music is not ostensibly political but the subliminal message is: it says that music can bridge wide cultural divides and bring people together -- that music has a universal appeal if it is well-done. This is definitely well-done.For more on me, go to www.alanelsner.com."
1,Don't go for seconds,"Only once the package was opened did we truely discover that the timer only counts down in minutes. It can however count up in seconds.So if you want a timer to count down in seconds, look for something else."
5,"Nice, easy timer","Nice, big numbers. Easy to use. Sits nicely on a table or clips on or has a magnet on back. I got it because my 90-yr-old mother needs a reminder every two hours, and this starts counting over again just by hitting one button."
4,Excellent timer. Nice & Loud. I wish it had a sec ticker though.,Very happy with it so far. I like the fact that is very loud.
3,Resets to zero each time,"I was looking for a timer that would sound the 10- and 5-minute warnings because I like to use it for the kids' required minutes to read each day and also piano practices. It's nice to give heads-up warnings that their time is almost up. The big thing that is really disappointing is that when the countdown timer goes off and you hit the stop button, the timer automatically begins to count up. You have to hit the start/stop button again to stop it. Then it simply retains the number of seconds that it was counting up. This means that the time is never retained from the previous minutes, and you have to set the number of minutes each and every time you use it."
3,magnet is weak,Timer works ok but if you plan on placing it on your refrigerator buy one with a stronger magnet.
4,Variety is the spice,I like all the cuts here except the the first two! A good chance for neo-acids to check out the genreJeffAtlanta
2,100 volt vs 240 volt,"It was unfortunate that although the transaction and delivery went well I cannot use this device in Australia as it has a US style 110 volt plug attached, the picture did not show this and the description did not mention it even though I looked for this info.....I expected dual plug set-up for this item as this common on many other overseas items. So I am disappointed, so check this before any electrical purchase from the USA or Amazon."
5,Just what I needed.,I was surprised to find this item for sale! I enjoyed working with this company.
5,Received item quickly and in perfect condition,Received item quickly--it arrived in a padded envelope the flimsy box was crushed but was quickly recycled. The item purchased was in perfect condition and works fine. Would by from this dealer again.
3,Not What I Expected,"Youd better get the Satriani albums themselves, starting with Crystal Planet. This tribute album was a totall dissapointment in my opinion."
2,Not the Right Throne,"This is a weak book from a poet who has done better and should know better. Schnackenberg manages to avoid everything, or almost everything, that is compelling about the Oedipus myth. There is one section, on the metaphoric origins of the Greek alphabet, that is fascinating (in a wholly fantastic sort of way), but the rest of the poem is as dead as the language Schnackenberg is talking about. This is a poet who has moved, in a relatively short time, from writing memorable poems (many of them in traditional forms) to poems that only antiquarians will remember. I thought A Gilded Lapse of Time, the poet's last book, was a fairly significant lapse, but this one goes even further. This is poetry written with an eye toward a MacArthur. The review in the New York Review of Books was a travesty, in my opinion. Caveat emptor."
4,Good but opening a little small,Opening for larger animals a little small and narrow. My pacman frog will get too wide for it after a while. Very nice looking.
1,came broken just like the other reviews promised,"a lot of the previous reviews said that their caves showed up in pieces because the packing wasn't very good. well that too was my problem with this item. i returned it and i don't plan on ordering a new because i doubt they'll get it right and wrap it with something that will actually protect it. do yourself a favor and go to petco, as they have reptile caves much like this, and you can see how big it actually is. also you know it isn't broken when you buy it!"
2,Extra large not very large.,If this is extra large I can't imagine what would fit in the small cave! Also it was broken when it arrived.
4,exo terra cave,It's nice got here sooner than what I thought. it had a small chip nothing bad like a little piece was shaved off its ok. My geckos love it I will be buy from you guys again.
4,Good Product,"The item came same as in the picture(Large) The only problem i had was the inside of the reptile cave has some very sharp edges which i removed and there were fibers visible on the inside. The outside looked great fits in my snake tank well and he loves it. Wish i would of gotten the XL. The Large is suppose to be 3"" but the majority of it is only 1"" in height. Item arrived in a box with brown paper not packaged the best since it was on top of paper but it was not broken. I can tell how these would arrive broken though i got lucky !"
5,They Got the Memo on Shipping,I read a dozen reviews stating this thing would come broken. Mine came double boxed and bubble wrapped. They got the memo. I don't think that they will have that problem again. Works great for my 2 year old ball python I keep in my Biology class.
2,Came broken as well...,"I didn't see these reviews before I purchased but probably would have given it a try for the price. ""You get what you pay for"" applies here... mine wasn't in pieces but had a large chip missing and was cracked half-way down the top. Not worth the hassle to return, so I rounded the sharp edge a little and used it anyhow. Looks nice in the terrarium and my new ball python prefers it over the coconut shell I had for him. I just hope it holds up and doesn't break."
2,An Amateur Effort,"Generally, the best biographies are *not* written by people who were friends of their subjects. Oderman's book is no exception to this rule. A long-time friend of Lillian Gish's, Oderman lacks the critical distance that incisive biography requires. He interviewed many sources, but he seems to have accepted their statements more or less without question, and his analysis, both of Gish and of film, is sketchy and superficial. Stylistically, Oderman's prose suffers from repetition, awkward phrasing, and a disconcerting lack of transitions. If he plans to publish more works with McFarland Press, he might consider asking them to find better copy editors. Typos, apostrophe errors, and usage gaffes such as ""did not phase her"" abound throughout the text. The most valuable parts of the book are the many quotations from Gish herself and from her contemporaries."
2,Not as good as his first two albums.,"I didin't care for this album at all.The only song that I thought was good,was the first track,""I Wanna Be Loved By You"".I recommend you just pick up his first two albums,""Ricky Lynn Gregg"" and ""Get A Little Closer"",and don't even bother with this one."
1,Not good live,"I recently went to Longview Tx. to see Foghat & had the chance to see Ricky Lynn Gregg live, he was terrible. I had never heard of him & the newspaper advertised him & Head East. Well there was no Head East & it's hard to believe he actually played in their band. All he did was talk & talk about the old days, his guitar playin & singing sucked big time. He finally left the stage after about 1 1/2 hrs of crap. I listened to some of the songs on this album & its easy to see why he hasnt had a new album lately."
4,Improved Greatness,"Ricky has always been a great performer. His live shows have great energy and the audience is always enthusiastic.This album, his third, shows how much he has grown over years on the road and has helped fine tune several of his own songs into classics.Victoria's Secret with added dobro and fiddle and at a slower pace makes a beautiful country song. Want to be Loved by You was a #1 hit in Europe for 6 weeks, and you can hear why.Several of the other songs have that rock-a-billy feel, that Ricky is famous for.His sweet tenor voice has enriched with age, and has deeper style than ever before. He is also an amazing guitarist, and should promote that even more than he does.Would be nice to have a great single for release in the States, with his style and talent it would really go over well.Overall, great job Ricky, and any lover of that sweet southern fried sound will enjoy this album, immensely."
2,Collapse,"These red feather snowshoe poles were of the telescoping type recommended for the sport. However, they collapse every few minutes no matter how much they are retightened. We were forced to go get poles in town after trying these, and were happy to find others that did not collapse."
5,Laid Back Mellow Grooves,"I can't believe this cd hasn't been rated. I came across this cd by accident and instantly fell in love. Contains alot of laid back sort of jazzy/funky cuts. I would definetly also recommend purchase the cd's of the individual artist on the cd, especially Soundscape UK."
2,Fairly useless,We bought this item for cooking. The intention is it would closely monitor temperatures of candy and chocolates as they cooked. If the thing was within 10% we were doing well. It could literally be 10 - 20+ degrees off regularly and jump up/down on each successive scan. Save your money and spend it on one of the expensive ($100+) professional versions with the light sensor if you need an accurate reading. If you need very general readings it is fine and does produce a reading.
2,Overview of Aalto's work.,"Clearly, as Weston testifies, there has been a need for a monograph on Aalto's architecture to compliment the supurb Aalto biographies by Schildt. However, despite the fine photographic reproductions and line drawings in this volume, the book clearly disappoints. Weston simply sees Aalto as a historical continuation of earlier Finnish architecture, but then fails to show why Aalto is so special, so different. Much space is given to saying something about nearly every Aalto building, and many of those never completed - some 300 completed buildings - but there is no critical edge to his comments, and no deep analysis. A good reference book, but nothing more."
1,Coffee-table book +,"Undoubtedly this is a book of fine photographs and drawings. And for many architects and students that is more than enough. They want to be inspired, and to get a feeling for the material qualities of architecture. They indeed need few words. But Weston's book makes a claim to be more than that. It claims to be a historical monograph. But we get little sense of the strangeness, the Otherness, of Finnish culture. Aalto could more or less be designing anywhere. Reference to Finland is merely stereo-typical ""nature"". Aalto remains as elusive as ever."
3,Beautiful photographs,"Beautiful photographs of Aalto's architecture. I don't think a monograph needs too many words. Weston provides the necessary dates and basic information, but luckilly keeps away from intellectualisations."
5,Movie & Soundtrack Hit the Spot,Profound indi film. Flashback on the music. A must see & must here soundtrack.
5,Great Natural Product,"I take Solaray Ginger Root Extract every day. My doctor actually prescribed it to help with my sinus condition. It really works, keeping sinus passageways clear so I can sleep at night. I would definitely recommend it to anyone suffering with sinus problems.Solaray - Ginger Root Extract, 250 mg, 60 capsules"
3,Its full of bugs unless you run it on Windows 98/ME,"These games lag, because the original programming of the games were designed for operating systems before Windows XP and 2000 and have various compatability issues that did not seem to be ironed out. The most notable issues are in driving games where the steering wheen acts as if the steering wheel is stuck all the way to the left spinning in circles. Sometimes the games do not exit properly, or there may be a delay before you can pause and exit.... Its very promising for $[...] but I wish the quality of this game would have been that of what Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe was......... No direct Console port from the XBOX, PS2 or Gamecube here. Just pure sloppiness."
2,Disappointed,"Unfortunately I didn't realize that the songs weren't by the original artists. I liked the CD better the 2nd time I listened to it and will certainly use it but, when you have a favorite oldie it's not the same hearing it sung by someone else."
5,Walk 70's Pop Hits,"Its a great CD. Use it when I walk, have increased my mile time and its not so boring to walk, as now I can listen to music and keeps me going."
4,Language learning,"I have only read up to Chapter 3 this far however the book is loaded with information and useful quotes and examples. It is easy to understand, just a lot of reading and may take a while to get through each chapter."
3,524 straight is not as flattering as the 524 skinny,"I wanted a pair that fits and flatters like the 524 skinny jeans, but with a touch more room in the lower leg so I don't have to peel them off at the end of the day. Ordered the same size that I wear in 524 skinny (down to a 3, thanks to Levi's out-of-control vanity sizing), but these have a slightly different fit in the rear than the 524 skinny jeans. The pockets sit noticeably lower on the butt, it's not as flattering from the back view. I'll have to re-evaluate them after they've gone through the wash a few times, as the fabric is really scratchy and stiff."
3,Vanity Sized,"I liked the color, but.... These pants were too big. Now that everyone is huge, manufacturers are scaling sizes up, so people think they still wear a smaller size. That is definitely the case with these. I ordered the size I usually wear, and that I ordered last time. Over all too large, especially in the thighs. That's why there are sizes 0 and 2 now, there weren't any sizes like that when I was a kid. They are fooling people into feeling skinny and therefore shopping more. Booo! Hiss!"
2,Wrong color,"Bought the color in Valley Blues, in the photos it look more like dark navy blue, when I received the jeans, it is in light shade of blue. I checked the jeans tag and it is stated Valley Blues. Obviously Amazon uploaded the wrong photos. Actual jeans color looks more like Worn Rigid."
4,Levi's Junior 524 Super Low Straight Leg,"These jeans seem to run very true to size except for the length. I got an average as I am 5'4"" and a 31 inch inseam is what I usually wear. These are extremely long not a true length and I'm going to have to hem them. They are very low sitting on the waist."
5,Men's Gray Teeshirts with a pocket.,"I was having a very tough time finding a gray tee with a pocket. My husband has to have a pocket, so I was happy to find these. They arrived on time, brand new in the packaging."
1,Not Colorfast,This shirt is not colorfast. When you wash it the result looks a lot like a tie dyed shirt. If I wanted a tie dyed shirt I would have bought it that way in the first place. I wonder whatever they dyed the shirt with is doing to my body.
1,Not as advertised,"I ordered three shirts via Amazon (NY Lingerie) on September 7, 2012. They were advertised on Amazon as ""Fabric: 100% Open-end Cotton"". The shirts I received were 90% cotton and 10% poly. I use these shirts when I exercise. I need 100% cotton for absorbency. Poly does not absorb. Do not buy these shirts!"
4,good value,My husband likes the pocket and the sizing is true to size. Did not like the fabric weight as much as other tees as it was a bit thicker. Shipping was prompt and pricing was excellent.
4,tee shirt.,"Very nice ttee, good heavy fabric. It has a pocket and is a nice, deep black, in addition to being affordable."
4,My Husband Likes Them,"I ordered these for my husband, He likes them. The quality is good as they have been washed a number of times and are still in great shape. The ""tagless' feature is a bonus as those tags inside the neck can get scratchy when they curl up with washing.They were delivered on time and I appreciate that too. I would buy these again."
5,Hanes Pocket T-Shirts,Good quality t-shirt with heavy cotton fabric. Will buy again at this low price.
3,Hanes Tagless Shirts with Pocket,"Shirts are okay. However, they do shrink up a lot. Buy bigger then what you actually need. Good delivery and no other problems with order."
2,Shrank about a size and a half,"The shirts fit okay when they arrived, but after one washing, they shrank at least a size. They are now snug, which isn't what I wanted."
5,Great T Shirt,"The shirt fit greast, washes well and a great price. The price is good also. I need to add five more words, so there."
3,OK but a little light weight for me.,These T's are fine but a little light weight for my use. I prefer the Carhartt T with pocket. It is heavy enough to carry a smart phone in the pocket.
5,Tagless T shirts,The company was terrific in both the quality of the product and in the promptness of shipping. I would definitely shop here again.
5,Great band!,"Had not listened to James Gang for years, so this is quite a treat. Joe Walsh has unique vocals and who doesn't like Funk #49? CD is in good condition and was shipped quickly and safe."
2,Springback Ledger,"The video is poorly edited, some processes are omitted and has no title to reinforce the content"
4,Attractive to people AND bugs,"First off, this thing is beautiful, as sugar bowls go. It's simple, made of high-quality brushed metal, and the lid fits easily but securely onto the top. It's slightly smaller than I had imagined, but it still holds enough sugar to serve most people's purposes.The downside is that both of the holes in the lid -- the finger hole that allows one to open the lid, and the notch that allows a spoon to be left in the bowl while the lid is in place -- are completely open. One could simply stick one's finger through that central hole and right into the sugar. While this isn't necessarily a problem under normal circumstances, it could prove to be frustrating if one has an insect problem. Instead of a closed bowl that would keep bugs out, this one is eternally open to anyone and anything that wants to get in.In short, this is an attractive, functional, high quality sugar bowl. Just don't expect it to keep anything out of your sugar."
3,"Great rotors, but....","I bought these rotors in July 2011 and didn't install the rotors until December. They fit my 2002 honda accord coupe V6. However, the phillips screw holes that hold the rotors to the wheel was not exact. It was off by almost a quarter inch. So I just left out the screws. My rims are holding that rotor in place. It should be fine and I have not had any problems so far. Did I get the wrong rotors? This makes no sense!"
3,Back to Basics,"Harold Budd (with sometimes collaborator Brian Eno) has produced some of the most evocative ambient music ever on gems like ""The Pearl"" and ""The White Arcades."" Other collaborations (Cocteau Twins, Andy Partridge, Hector Zazou) saw him expanding his musical palette, but here he pulls it back to minimal piano and background texturings. The results are rather predictable and, in some instances, even tedious. I've read the reviews here and tried to like this album more, but it just doesn't rise above some of his other work, even after repeated playing. For those who love Budd's music, it's still a disc worth having for times of quiet reflection. Mostly, though, I reflect back on his earlier work--and find myself going back to those discs again and again when I'm in need of quiet inspiration."
4,sublime Budd,"What can I say? Some of Harold B's later works have sounded a bit same-ish, but this little beauty is great. Very calm and peaceful like the best of B. Eno's."
3,Not the best Budd,"I should state my bias up front: I'm a very big fan of Harold Budd's contemplative, ethereal piano/synth music, but I was somewhat disappointed by this one. Some of the tracks are quite good, but on the whole, many of the tracks simply didn't grab me. Definitely not as engaging as the very enjoyable ""Luxa"", which spends much more time in my CD carousel."
4,Like a lost album from 1988,"I am conservative about giving five stars and so four is a very high rating. I am a very long term Budd fan and really look forward to anything new from him. If you love Budd's music, you will love this. The liner notes don't make it quite clear but it appears that the music was mostly recorded around 1988 when he released The White Arcades. This was the only let down for me. I was looking forward to hear what Budd would be in 2000, especially after his great last album LUXA from 1996 which showed progression from the past. This album most closely resembles The White Arcades while being a bit less synthy, a bit less cluttered, and a bit slower. I think I like it more than The White Arcades. Of course it is beautiful."
3,Mediocre,Expected more from this CD. Still enjoy it although wish it had more unity over the entire album. A few good tracks.
3,Intro to Philo.,This book covers the very basic of philosophy and does its job well. It also provide some sample parodoxes though not extensive. Heavy reading in some area for philosophy is not my strong point. This books resonate with many philosophical discussion to be had. I enjoy most of the readings.
2,WORDY AND FEW PAINTINGS,Maybe I am silly but if you are going to call a book a companion on a painter you should have plenty of paintings from each of the periods in his/her life to share with the reader. This book is primarily sound even exciting scholarship with a paltry amount of paintings.If you are taking a graduate course in art history it is right on target however if you are madly in love with the art of this giant go elsewhere for your pleasure.
2,Not impressed.,"Extremely disappointed with this book. Rather than focusing on the struggles, adversities, drawbacks, and the unhappiness of being a designer, I'd rather invest my time in a text which offers concrete instruction on how to overcome the obstacles. This book is premised upon the ""facts"" that you: a) require hundreds of thousands of dollars in reserve to even consider launching your own line, b) MUST work for several years under another designer prior to designing for yourself, and c) you most likely won't make it, even on a small scale. Every artist is aware of monetary limitations and minuscule success rates, so I believe most of us would benefit more from tangible advice, and an author who can offer various routes to achieve discernible goals (rather than abstract ideas and incessant ""words of warning""). A few good points throughout the book, but I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Very realistic. A must-read,"This is a great book. If you want to know how the business really is, read this book. The only reason why I took off a star is because I was terrified after reading it. It briefly discouraged me from design because it seemed to focus on all of the pitfalls."
3,AVERAGE READING,I found this book to be less good than I expected yet still a good or average book. There are too many quotations I think and most of them on issues not needed.
3,For a beginner,"It's a limited view of the fashion bussiness, it doesn't aport much value, it should be complemented with other books"
5,A Fashion Treasure Guide!,"I'm part of the shion industry, and let me tell you that with this book I know much much more my industry and I have far more respect for the hard working people who breath and live in that industry! Fashion is one of the hardest industries out there and it is good to see that in that book you get the chance to understand all the pitfulls you can face in the fashion world, but also how to avoid many of themespecially if you want to start your own business! ! I have read this ""Fashion Treasure Guide"" three time in a row!!! It's so well written too! Bravo!"
5,Everything you need to know and more,"This book is the most concise source of information on how to mindfully start one's own clothing line. Detailed and clear, it outlines everything one needs to know from inseption and development through financials, incorporation, press, factory relations, shows and beyond. It is, by far, the most complete resource for any aspiring designer."
4,Avoid the pitfalls of owning your own fashion design business,"This is an excellent tutorial IF you already have a basic background in the fashion industry, otherwise, you might not understand certain information predicated on the assumption of a knowledge base.I would most certainly recommend it for anyone thinking of starting their own business in the fashion industry. It will skillfully guide you through the land mines of the fashion landscape and prevent you from getting a leg blown off!Clear, concise and thorough. Lots of 'white space' on every page prevents the reader from being overwhelmed and sublimimally infers that starting your own business IS simple enough that you absolutely can succeed!Just do your due diligence with Mary. Good luck!"
4,Great book for starting out,"Easy to read, concise book to anyone interested in starting their own line."
3,Excellent for High Schoolers,"As a fashion design student, I was given this book before attending school by a friend. I read it all in one day and really appreciated all the information in it. But, I will say that I understood most of the business end of the information because I had already taken a college level business class.The information in this book is very general and I would say it is excellent for someone who is thinking about going into the fashion industry and wants a realistic view of the process. Reading it before attending classes will give you a head start to understanding key concepts that will be covered.If you already have a degree, I agree with one of the other reviewers, I wouldn't buy it."
3,Great if you're clueless.,"This is a great book for those that know absolutely nothing about the fashion industry. People who don't watch ""Project Runway,"" have never done any research into the fashion industry, and/or are middle/junior high schoolers doing career-research.However, if you're looking to start a small boutique, launch an entirely online business, or just want to break into fashion design, this is NOT the book for you. This book is geared ENTIRELY to the mass-market, high-end fashion business side of things and takes no account for small scale designers that aren't looking to go to Bryant Park, but just make a living from their designs.The book also stresses the ""tired and true"" logic of the industry, and doesn't make any attempts to adopt new and radical methods being implemented by young and innovative designers who are flipping the industry on it's ear by doing things completely differently from their mass-market predecessors."
3,good help,not finished reading but so far it is an informative read but it could give more ideas and tips.
5,An Eye Opener and perhaps a Mind opener,"This is one of the best books I've ever read on American history and is one I plan on having my children and my parents read. Give it as a gift to your favorite History buff or ""Puritanical"" room-mate. This book makes Clinton look like a poster boy for All American;-> Too bad I had to wait until I was almost 40 to learn the truth that I suspected all along. Ditch the Myths of our forefathers and teach the Human side of these men... it detracts nothing from them and makes them that much more real. A Great and Fun read!"
2,Riddled with Errors,"The glowing reviews for this little hit piece (evidentally published to capitalize on the whole impeachment passion play of a couple of years back) moved me to buy the book. A glance over the contents quickly revealed several ludicrous errors that should never have passed the proofreader, if indeed there was one. (For example, at one point it claims that Andrew Jackson was the first president to be elected after being defeated for the office. In the very next sentence it mentions Thomas Jefferson as one of the other men who share this honor! There are other laughable errors, too.) Had the authors and their editor (was there one) concentrated more on content control than on fancy typography and tedious Clinton-bashing, this book might have been a worthy addition to the bathroom reading shelf."
2,Mororola,"I previously owned and used the 5 mi. version to communicate with my wife while I am going to and from the school bus stop for the kids. From the bus stop the 5 mi. unit was iffy. I purchased the 16 Mi. units thinking the little extra power and range would make for better receive at the bus stop. It was worse. We received no signal whatsoever, not a peep. Don't buy this unit. Save your money and buy the 5 mi unit."
4,Versatile Radio with Extra Power,"I needed more coverage than the typical FRS radios provide. I work with people outdoors in hilly terain, reliable communications is vital, so I tried 4 of these SX800R radios from Mot. They where easy to set up and use. The crew trained up in less that 5 minutes. They provided the extended coverage needed and worked reliably. Fast recharge and day long battery life was just what we needed.The FCC has a quick and pain free way to get the license to operate at the higher power levels of GMRS. Still in use today and very handy."
2,Forget about 16 miles,"Just did a A/B comparison between the SX800R (16 mile range)and the Midland GXT-450 (10 or 12 mile range). Neither radio came anywhere near the effective range advertised. The Midland lost communcation after 1/2 of a mile apart in the woods. I then tried both radios on a flat open road. At 2.9 miles apart, neither radio could pick up it's counterpart. It wasn't until we hit the 1.8 mile mark that the Motorola picked up some static from the other Motorola. Still nothing from the Midland. At approx 1.5 miles apart, the motorola worked fine. I gave up with the Midland. The reason I did not give the Motorola a 1 star rating was because I like the weather band feature. Bottom line is, that unless you are in an airplane with no obstructions at all or curvature of the earth to worry about, forget about getting anywhere near the advertised range. A good rule of thumb is, if you can see the other person, then you are in range."
3,Motorola walkie talkies,Range is not as good as claimed. Volume needs to be louder. Fully charged batteries last a long time.EDIT- These walkie talkies are pretty much junk now. May be battery-related but I don't want to spend more money on them.
2,Disappointed with the Motorola SX 800R,This is the 2nd set of Motorola Radios I have tried over the last few years. The 1st pair I sent back (don't remember the model) & I would have sent these back had I not been so busy at the time. I like the size & features of these but they didn't have enough volume & very limited talking distance. We used them on vacation while traveling & talked back & forth to each other in different cars & we could talk up to 1-1.5 miles. I have an older set of Talkabouts I've had for about 10 years & they are still better than the SX 800Rs. They are much clearer & although they are only rated for 2 miles they out perfom the SX 800Rs which are rated for 16 miles. I bought the newer ones for the rechargable battery packs & thought I would be able to talk farther distances. I use them mostly for hunting & they are pretty much useless in the woods over a few hundred yards. Save your money & buy the Midland GXT850VP4. I'm sorry Motorola but you can do better than this.
3,Very Solid Around the Neighborhood,"We bought these so our daughter could have some freedom around the neighborhood, but still be in contact with us. They work well around our subdivision and about a mile outside of it. They do not, however, work the promised 16 mile distance. Perhaps you could get them to work for 16 miles if you were standing in an open field with no interference, but not where I live. Easy to use and operate, sound quality is very good as well."
3,Broken but will work,"I received my package fast which is a plus. The problem is that it's broken. There are some pieces that broke off in what I assumed was the shipping of the product which was no issue, I can deal with a few nicks. My biggest concern was the fact that the binder rings were off and the little brads that hold it in place were bent beyond repair. I am content using it simply as a storage box."
5,Microsoft Imaging,"My order arrived before the scheduled date. Even though I purchased a used item, Microsoft Digital Image Suiste 10.0, it was in great condition. This was the first time I have ordered somethng used and was very surprised it was in such good shape, i.e. box, booklet and disc."
3,Digital Image Suite,"I think I will enjoy my photo editing disc set, although I have not had alot of time with it yet."
2,Dissapointed!,"Do not wast your money. You can do almost everything with the standard XP Profissional that you can with this looser. Sorting within files is almost impossable, defalt settings dictates assending or decending orders, regardless of your pictures folders arrangement. Mot worth the money!"
2,No longer works without change of ISP!,"What a disappointment. I have loyally upgraded this product annually since it was known as PictureIt. Some time back I discovered that version 10 was the last, and it would now be integrated into Vista.I am a happy Xp customer, and have no intention of slowing down my PC by installing Vista. But guess what? Not only did they not come out with a new version, the old one recently stopped working, and a popup appears telling me that I must install MSN software to make it work!So I agreed to install MSN software, then discovered I had to be a paying MSN subscriber. SOOOOO....like a sucker, I upgraded to the paid Hotmail subscription. But that wasn't good enough.In order to get Digital Image Pro 10 to work, which I already paid for, I have to change my ISP to MSN......I must pay around $250 a year just to get my unsupported software to run again!I am angry."
2,"Some functions doesn't work well, poor quality","Digital Image Pro Ver. 9 was better quality software. Version 10 made improvements on automating some tasks but made other fundamental functions work really badly: If you apply Red Eye correction, most of times when trying to increase the effect to achieve a natural eye color, the software inserts like a Black ring around the eyes!! Also, the sharpen function works pretty, pretty bad!!I don't understand why releasing to market software with these kinds of bugs on features that are used the most? why if they were working perfectly on version 9?I returned this very expensive (""very poor"" price/performance) software to buy other program where all the editing functions work as they should!!"
3,Work for smaller photos but not big,"This program is good for working with smaller size pictures (4 x 6 in). It's just working fine. No problem. However, once you work with large image, 10 x 8 in, it was so slow in my Pentium 4 PC (725MB RAM, 3 HD, regularly defragmented, WIndows XP Prof, and background programs turned off, see nothing from the Task Manager). Basically I have a canvas size 10 x 8 in, 300 dpi resolution with several JPG pictures (1-2 MB size each) in it. When you crop the JPG or work with magic wand, the program runs very sluggish. It made me frustrated to wait 60 seconds for each activity. Note that although I have to wait for a while, the result (print out) of the images are very good and super. It's just the waiting time is very annoying."
1,This album is no good,"I listen to Dire Straits, Guns N' Roses, and more other bands.Guttermouth's voice is way more terrible than other bands I've heard. I got this CD because I'm Destroying the World had someof the greatest music of all time and other than that, the cd isnot anything good. The music is totally terrible. Way underatted.There are many other albums in the world that are much better andthis one's not worth it. Skip this, and buy some albums by betterartists. This is definatly not one of the best bands ever! Nevergreat and don't buy it anytime."
3,A New Guttermouth,"In Las Vegas, Guttermouth played a free concert in Tower Records the day this album came out premoting it. I went to the concert and it was really good, even though it was cut short by security, and I believe the only song they played from this album was She's Got The Look. I purchased the CD at the Tower Records and when the concert ended I went home and listened to it. I was quite surprised with what I heard. This is not in any way a bad album, but it doesn't match up with albums of their past shuch as Musical Monkey and Teri Yakimoto. Also I would like to add I don't consider this at all Guttermouth selling out, now there on the same lable as other punk bands such as Pennywise. If you are in the market for a Guttermouth CD, make sure you get Musical Monkey, and maybe some time later, Covered With Ants."
2,What the?????,Did I just buy a Blink 182 album? Is this really Guttermouth? I'm not quite sure what happened to them but it seems the fun (thrash) has left. safe and fun for the whole family....anyway I'll give them 2 stars instead of one because theres a couple of funny lines on it. But its no where near their tour de force 'Musical Monkey' and 'Gorgeous'.
4,not a bad cd,THis cd is not a bad cd although lots of people say it is. Its not the best guttermouth cd but if your a fan you should buy it.Can i borrow some ambition is probbably the best song on the cd so if youve heard that dont look foward to hearing anything better.
3,First Guttermouth cd i bought.,"This is the furst guttermouth cd is bought. I really think that track 2 is wicked. This album is basically worth getting for that one track. As for the others, after musical monkey, guttermouth only got worse. So if you liked Gorgous, get this , but if you didnt like how they changed their sound, this is more of the same so steer clear."
5,A classic and a must-read!,"I originally bought this book more for the Jewish theology than the reincarnation cases as such. When it first came out back in 1992, it was the only book around that explained anything about Jewish reincarnation teachings in a way that didn't require three Ph.Ds. The Rabbi's open, personal style made me feel like he was teaching me as an equal, not talking down to me from some ivory tower somewhere.It was also the only book that offered a more sophisticated view of the Holocaust than the stupid ""karmic payback"" theories that were floating around back then (and now, too.) In my opinion, this book did more than any book I know of to make New Agers re-examine their negative Old Age attitudes about Jews and Judaism. It's a reincarnation classic and still a must-read. It sure changed my ideas about ""Jewish karma"" -- and my life, too."
5,I was really surprised Jews believe in this!,"I heard about this book because of a review that Rabbi Gershom did about Monteleone's novel, ""Night of Broken Souls."" Believe me, ""Beyond the Ashes"" is much better than any fiction! The true case histories that the Rabbi tells are really amazing. Once I started reading, I could not stop.The Rabbi's book also has a really good chapter on Jewish beliefs about reincarnation and life after death -- which really surprized me that they can believe in it. I was taught in Sunday school that Jews do not beleive in life after death at all, but boy, did this book set me straight on that one!I came away from this book with a much deeper respect for Jews and Judaism, as well as some real good insights about reincarnation. This book taught me that Jews do have a spirituality, too. Even if you are not very interested in the Holocaust, read it for the theology parts. It will change your life."
2,"By Only Reading the Table of Contents, I Saw--","Hey, Dr. Dummy! ""Say Your Crazy"" --- YOUR is the possessive, YOU'RE is the correct contraction of ""you are."" Got it, Dr. Ph.D. M.D. Psychiatrist?No, I didn't purchase this book, I was glancing at ""search inside this book.""Someone that addle-pated who managed to earn all those degrees without even the simplest grasp on English grammar rules and spelling usage. . . . unless you just happen to have a very, very bad editor, so shame on you both."
3,McEnroe's Raging Imperfection,"Sound life story of America's greatest male tennis player, a man who dominated his sport during the early 1980's, carrying to this day, twenty-one years later, the highest winning percentage in tennis history. The inside stories are here of the great rivalries that pushed McEnroe to heights of on-court genius. In concentrating on McEnroe the athlete instead of McEnroe the person, what this books does wrong is it fails to ask the tough questions about its subject's on-court antics, his off-court misbehaviors (the man can really be a jerk) and the reports of drug abuse and domestic violence that dogged him late in his career. This is a pro-McEnroe book and that's fine, nothing wrong with writing favorably about your subject, but it lacks objectivity and secretly reveals something resembling hero worship on the part of its author."
1,Caveat Emptor!,"I am a freshman medical student at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock. If there is one thing that I can do for my colleauges is to wave a red flag and tell you NOT to buy this book. Firstly, the organization is extremely poor. Secondly, some information is inaccurate and/or outdated. Finally, the material is obviously condensed from a superior text on Histology by Gartner & Hyatt. Although, G&H is more expensive, it is well worth your money. The two color illustrations are also ""modified from"" other texts."
5,good book,"I am a second year medical student. I disagree with the previous poster. This book is incredibly well written and clinically relevant, especially to the USMLE. This book integrates alot of the molecular biology that is showing up frequently on the usmle. If you like the style of the rapid review series...this will fit you.And to the previous poster, ideally we would all be using ""TEXTS"" to study for the usmle. You can't compare review books with major texts."
5,Contains rare Earl Hooker tracks,"This is a hard to find 24 track compilation of guitar blues recorded by Sam Phillps in Memphis in the early 1950's. Many of these recordings had not been previously released on CD until the British label Charly Records put out this disc in 1990. The first ten tracks feature the late, great guitarist Earl Hooker. Hooker's tracks from 1953, eight as front man and one each backing Boyd Gilmore and Pinetop Perkins, are mostly instrumental. Additional tracks feature guitarists Pat Hare and Willie Johnson, but the Hooker tracks are the reason to seek out this CD. His playing was fluid, melodic and displayed country and rock influences. Hooker died tragically young from TB in 1970. These are among his earliest recordings. The price may be steep, but well worth it for any blues guitar afficianado."
1,"Good Instruments, sappy songs, bad voice","Too bad the instruments in this album have gone to such waist because thats the best thing that can be said about it. the voice of this man is weak and weary and frankly overbearing. The best song is ""kinda like a rainbow"""
3,High School sweetheart stealer,"I went to high school with him; he called himself Bobby in those days, not Robert Lee. Good 12 string player, glad to see him making it."
5,Lyrics,"What a great song writer! I love listening to the words of these songs, and while the grumble of a singing isn't technically stellar, it brings the songs to life - in the tradition of Johnny Cash. I thoroughly enjoy this record."
1,The Best Part of This One Flew Away........,"This is actually a very good, informative book in many ways. The problem is in one respect that it's not what its title purports it to be, and it also failed to include photographs--a feature that would be an invaluable addition to a work of this quality. I reside in Brown County--definitely in north-central Texas, but this book's jurisdiction doesn't even come close to where I live. Rather, this book focuses on the Metroplex (DFW) and surrounding environs. Any real Texan knows that the Metroplex isn't even in Central Texas; it's in North Texas. Had this book been properly entitled to indicate that it covers North Texas, and had pictures been included, I would've given it a rating of five stars, despite the fact that it's inappropriate for my locale. As matters stand, I wasted my valuable time and money."
4,"Pioneer TS-W300R 12"" Component Subwoofer","I installed this subwoofer into a large bandpass box. It holds two 12"" woofers, has a plexiglass center and is double ported on each side with 4"" ports. Shortly after mounting the speaker, one of the terminals connected to the speaker broke off and started shorting against the other side. I hadn't realized this until I could smell something burning. The woofer also looked like it was having a seizure! After letting the speaker cool down (it was blazing hot), I wrapped the broken side with electrical tape. To my amazement, the speaker still works and pumps out great. Just like new. Not many speakers can take that kind of abuse. I knew that if I had blown it, at least I wasn't going to be out of a lot of money. I can drive the Pioneer TS WS300R down low and very deep. The bass is tight and loud, you can feel it through your bones."
5,Not for the weak of heart,"I found this film to be somewhat disturbing at times,and dark also.But somehow, this is the very reason I kept watching from beggining to end. It's so disturbing at times that you want to keep watching just to seeif it will end good or bad. There are a few story lines involved,but they come together brilliantly,but again be careful,each has it's own disturbing twist.If the darker side of humanity bothers you, then this is not the film for you to watch......but if you can somehow overcome that,to seebrilliant writing, then you will definitely like this movie."
4,A very professional book for the professional model,"If you are someone interested in getting into the modeling field this book definitely would be essencial for your home library. I am a modeling instructor and each time I prepared my modeling lesson this book is with me. It teaches me lots of ideas for my students, from how to start in the modeling business, creating an image, everything and anything about runway, careers, makeup techniques, agencies and how to market yourself, etc... The pictures are a little old fashion, black and white and the fonts used in this book are very small making it more difficult sometimes to read, maybe because it has so much information, but it is very simple to understand everything. I do recommend this book to anyone. I do recommend my students to buy it, it is a little expensive but it is worth it!"
4,A detailed book to tell you exactly what you need to know.,"I love this book. I read it constantly to psyche myself up for the future. It tells everything about the modeling world - a list of symbols for runway choreography, recipes for body care, what to carry with you, how to interview, and everything else from start to finish. The pictures are drawn however and are a bit 80's looking (even though it was written in the 90's)but the book is more about learning than hearing amazing stories. Its a how to guide that goes into amazing detail. I recomend it for those who want to know about how to act and what to do in the modeling world."
2,"A tired, dated analysis...","Balhorn's explicit exploration of the intricacies of the (mainly American) modelling world seem perfect for the brash mid 1980's surge in modelling interest and public obsession, yet seems almost comically isolated in today's understated chic that the industry is based upon."
3,Night Witches: The Story of Soviet Airwomen in WWII,"This is the very first book by a Westerner on Soviet airwomen in combat in World War II; as such, it represents a welcome contribution to military history. What's more, the book is based on eyewitness accounts: Mr. Myles made several trips to the USSR to interview many of the survivors. He also gained access to personal records, photos, regimental histories, and other written sources. Nevertheless his book apears to be mainly ""oral history"" intended for popular audiences, without thorough and careful use of written materials. This is undoubtedly why--despite its general authenticity, objectivity and recapturing the spirit of the times--it is marred by numerous errors and omissions. All this criticism indicates that the book must be used with caution and should be followed by more accurate and complete publications on the subject."
4,a good book,I like this book very much. I am waiting for the movie it is being filmed right now in Russia. (..) The heroines deserve to have their stroy told so everybody will know about them. I enjoyed the story of Lily Litvak (...) This book tells her true story and the story of other Russian women who fought in World War 2.
5,Exciting and entertaining,"Although this book does not claim to be a concise history, it is what it sets out to be. It is a collection of the accounts of the Russian woman pilots themselves. I was drawn to them on a personal level, and I could almost feel what they are feeling. Some of the reviewers here are criticizing it because it is not what one would normally expect from a history book, but those critisms are out of order, in my opinion. If you want a dry, boring history book, look elsewhere. If you want something fun and interesting to read, this book is top notch."
5,OUTSTANDING,"Buy it. Buy it now. Hit the little one-click button up to the right there. This is an outstanding book. Written in the words of the women who flew, and in the back photos of each of them today. This is one of the best books I have read in a decade."
4,Informative,"Reveals a relatively unknown part of WW II history involving women in combat. I had no idea of the role of the Soviet female aircrews, their dedication, skill and performance. May not be the best written book from a literary perspective but the content and episode-weaving into a riveting novel are excellent. Highly recommend!"
4,It is a very moving story.,"I would hope that this story be included in any history about WWII and, especially of, the Battle of Stalingrad. I recently read a book about Stalingrad and nothing was mentioned about these women. It is very moving and well written. The author included some imaginings with a soap opera element but the facts are dramatic enough to make it a very interesting book. The photos add a lot to it."
4,Night Witches,"My husband and I enjoyed this book very much. He is a former pilot, so nothing was lost on him! We have passed the book on to a friend who is reading it now."
4,a good book,I like this book very much. I am waiting for the movie it is being filmed right now in Russia. It will be in Russian and English language. The heroines deserve to have their stroy told so everybody will know about them. I enjoyed the story of Lily Litvak who shot down the famous Nazi. The Nazi didn't believe it was a girl who had defeated him until he met her and she described the fight. Then he just put his head down in disgrace! This book tells her true story and the story of other Russian women who fought in World War 2.
3,very informative.,"I read this for my college history 152 class. This book displays a very positive view of women doing what men can do, while retaining their femininity."
3,Broken Crystal,"Crystal easily scratched and indeed it has been, is a great disappointment to me. Please notify the manufacturer of this problem."
1,Tiger woods pga tour 07,"Played ever golf game from mario golf until now skipped 06 this is the worst ever in game play,putting is a joke,tons of glitches,when you make a wager and win your money does not increase.Made a birdie put from the fringe said I was out of bounds 2 stroke penality,dud.Got 4 players maxed out I am done with this game,one good thing if you some how manage to get ahead in a tourament you can save progress and quit(RENT IT FIRST)"
1,2005 version is much better,"To keep it simple do not make the same mistake i did...if you have the 2005 version of this game for PS2, keep it and save your money. in the 2007 version, there are several problems:1. no caddy tip for putting.2. graphics are not as good. not as crisp or clean as 2005.3. instruction manual does not explain what the different icons are on the screen.Trust me, i threw the 2007 game to the side and kept playing the 2005 version b/c it is much better!"
3,"Still a fun game, but the series is getting stale","The gameplay elements in Tiger Woods 07 are solid, and even go back to some of the roots that made 04 such a great game. No more Gamebreakers from last year for that auto hole-in-one, no Tiger Vision to automatically knock down 80 foot putts with 20 feet of break. So the challenge is there.But it's the game modes that have gotten old. The new Team Tiger mode is too short and less rewarding as so much of your success is dependant on the building of your teammates. PGA Tour is solid as always, although still too easy (winning tournaments with -60 scores and such).Graphically, the game is top notch as always. And the course selection is beautiful. But at the same time, it has not improved noticably since 04. Nice to see Highlands back in the game, though.Get this game if you are a die hard Tiger fan, but if you are new to the series, probably better to stick with 04 or even 05."
2,Tiger Woods 2006 Was Better,"I bought Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2007 back when it first came out. For the purpose of this review lets pretend Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2008 - 2010 do not exist. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2007 is a huge letdown after playing Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006. Many of the features that made Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006 so enjoyable were taken out. The new features added for 2007 were absolute garbage. Chasing Tiger back in time in Tiger Woods PGA tour 2006 is much more enjoyable. I would stay away from this version of Tiger Woods PGA Tour, even if Amazon has it on sale for one dollar don't buy it - unless you need a coaster-."
4,Pretty Good,"I just got the game and think it is pretty good overall. I like the team aspect of it and how you can totally tweek your appearance. The difficulty of the game is pretty fair. However it seems the computer over exxagerates the scores of your competition. For example I had to shoot a -54 under par just to win my first major. These guys were shooting consecutive rounds of 54 or less. It was pretty weak I thought. Anyways, that is one of the only major flaws I see in the game."
4,Tiger '07 vs. Tiger '06,"Last years version was better in my opinion. There were fun options, such as playing in a different time era. While the playing of music is ok for some games I thought having it play while on the course was a little unreal. Last years version was more relaxing, as golf should be."
2,same old thing,IF YOU HAVE PLAYED ANY OF THE PREVIOUS TIGER WOODS YOU HAVE PLAYED THIS ONE...THINK THEY ARE JUST GOING OFF THE NAME AND NOT MAKING THE GAME ANY BETTER...BUT IF YOU NEVER HAVE PLAYED ONE YOU WILL ENJOY IT ....
4,Great game... but the netplay? Not so much.,"Great as usual. New courses and all. As a TW franchise buyer since 2000, I feel it was a little above average. If you bought last year's game, this is about the same. Save the cash and buy Madden 07 instead. :)EA really seems to be dropping the ball on the whole netplay thing in all their games, and don't expect this one to be any different. Hopefully with the PS3 out they'll focus on that a lil bit.Overall, 4 out of 5. Hot Shots is lots of fun too... and only $20. Hint hint!"
4,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07,"Game is not bad, but it hasn't evolved much since I first played it in 2004. However, its still the best golf game available on PS2. I would like to see more from future versions."
4,Addictive,"This was my first time buying a golf game, and I absolutely love it! I love the real emotions of the players, and I love creating a player and dressing them up. I also love the scenery and the golf courses. The graphics are excellect! Especially the The Falls. I don't know what the last version was like, but this one is really good, and can be addictive.Even if you are a novice at golf as I am, it has tutorials and practice sessions set up that are easy for you to learn. I think this is a game that you and your family will enjoy."
1,NEXXUS HUMECTRESS,I agree with the other customers reviewing NEXXUS HUMECTRESS on amazon. They cheapened the product. Plus added a nasty scent. I liked the old product which had no scent. Will never purchase nexxus humectress again.
2,little moisture/not high quality like its price,"I was referred to try this product to protect my hair from heat and to give my hair moisture. Well, I had bought this product over a year ago, and well I still have it. When you really like a product, it goes faster than the ones that you don't like (and don't work well). This creamy looking goop makes my hands and hair feel like I'm coating them when applying it to the hair. It doesn't moisturize the hair well even though it wets it but when my hair dries, no moisture outcome. With my results and others similar to mine, I don't know why Nexxus still costs so much. Needless to say, I won't ever try Nexxus again or any of its products. IF you buy this in-stores, PLEASE Keep your receipt so you can possibly get a refund."
1,CAUTION: PRODUCT COMPLETELY REDESIGNED,"I've used Humectress hair conditioner for over two decades. Seemed perfect. Great effect on my hair, AND, little or no intrusive scent.That product is GONE.You can ignore every review you've ever read of this product.It now has a SEVERE SCENT. Probably some will like it and others not, as with any scent. My concern is that I don't want a strong scent in my shampoo or conditioner. If I want to wear a scent, I will choose one.Personally I find the new scent hideous, in addition to being too strong.Nexxus, bring back the classic Humectress, or, at least take away the absurdly strong scent of the new product!"
1,Disappointed,"I usually only use conditioner on my hair the day after flat ironing, which isn't frequent. This conditioner doesn't work for me. My hair sheds when I wash it, but usually in long strands. When I use this conditioner, short pieces of my hair break off. My hair is pretty healthy, not color treated, minimal exposure to heat styling tools, and the breakage only occurs while I am applying and rinsing out this conditioner. The breakage does not occur on days when I only shampoo. Also, once my hair dries, it looks dull and flat, which again only occurs on days I use this conditioner. At first, I thought the breakage, dullness, and lack of body were due to my flat iron use, but I haven't used heat tools in a couple of weeks and decided to use the conditioner this morning and had the same problems. I'll be switching to something else."
3,"Keyboard works well, Arabic letters on it are terrible","The keyboard is perfectly fine as a keyboard, works well as plug and play. The issue with it is the actual printed Arabic letters - they look hieroglyphics -literally. Its clear that a non-arabic person WROTE them and then they printed them on the keyboard. It looks absolutely ridiculous - even the numbers are botched with the 7 written as a ""Y"" - its really the most absurd thing I've ever seen. I prefer to just buy a regular keyboard and put stickers on it."
4,Made in USA,"In this day and age, it is almost impossible to find products that are not made in China and made to last about 6 months before they fall apart. It works as advertised, the ring at the end is loud and lasts long enough for you to hear it and respond."
2,Good while it lasts,"This has a nice long, loud ring. Unfortunately, it stopped working after about a year. I haven't found any others with any better reviews."
1,Worthless - Do NOT buy,"I read the other reviews for this product and took a chance, hoping I would get lucky with one that works. No such luck. Very poor quality. It arrived defective. Each time I turn the dial and let go, it springs back to 3 minutes past 0 instantly. The ringer works. Other than that, it's total junk. I returned it to choose one that runs on batteries instead."
2,Lux Timer - Extended Ring,I bought two timers to replace the one I that had broken. The standard timer was just like the old one. Perfect. Since I'm not always near the kitchen I wanted the extended one for a better chance to notice it. The ring is definitely extended but the volume is not as high. I also bought a timer that hangs around your neck so it's there wherever you are. That's the superior choice.
4,"Good Timer, But...","Thes Lux timers are great, but they've omited the raised numbers which makes it hard for the blind to use. I had to have someone etch some markings on it."
2,Not the way they used to be,"Went through two of these in two years, they just stopped working. I do use them almost every day, but for something as simple as a timer I'd expect it to last for YEARS. Cheap plastic gears inside. They just don't make them like they used to."
1,Very Poor Quality Timer,"Have always used Lux timers in the past and wanted a new one. The quality control must have been non-existent on this timer, as the dial was not set on zero. As a result, it's impossible to set the correct number of minutes and a five minute setting results in seven minutes of time. I will never buy any product made by Lux in the future."
1,Disappointed......,We had a Lux Long Ring timer when I was a kid and the old one would ring very loudly for a very long time. The new version has a very subdued ring. This was a waste of money.
4,sturdier than i thought,i'm not really into the canister but it feels a bit more durable than i expected. it also holds more than just the utensils that come with it albeit maybe not a LOT more. the utensils are sturdy and i'm pleased with this purchase.
5,best treatment for cracked heels.,"I've had serious problems with cracked heels from dermatitis. I use these daily at night, along with the creams prescribed by my Doctor. Both the dermatitis and cracked heels have gone away, or are at least well I bought controlled."
3,Not for Bigfoot,"These socks make a lot of sense and will probably work on my dry, cracked heels, but they're not meant for someone with size 14 feet. I doubt they'd be comfy for anyone over mens' size 10.There's an obvious fix -- you can make a cut in the top of the sock opposite the heel to relieve the sock pressure on the top of the foot and ankle. I doubt they'll hold up for long after being cut, though.Someone with sewing machine skills could probably manage that, but perhaps the manufacturer could consider making them in a larger size. Or not -- only rarely do I find clothing made to fit my basketball-player-sized body... <sigh>"
5,These really work!,"I have extremely dry heels. They crack and make it hurt to walk on them. Over the years I have tried many products, from cremes to lotions...you name it. I have a Dr Scholls foot bath and soak them at least once a week, but still they get so dry and crack. I have used these Visco-Gel Heel-So-Smooth heel sleeves for only 2 nights and already notice a HUGE improvement!! I give them a BIG thumbs up! Anyone suffering from cracked heels should definitely give them a try."
5,"Yes, it works","So glad I listened to the other reviewers and bought this. I use this gel sleeve along with Heeltastic and my feet are thanking me. The gel is soft and very cooling when you first put them on. I was concerned that they might be uncomfortable to sleep in, but that's not the case. I barely notice them. Also, it's worth it to have soft, smooth feet."
2,Disappointed,"After the first two uses, the sleeves would not stay in place - with the gel heel cushion traveling all over the foot. I would not spend money on this again."
3,not for larger feet,"This item says one size fits most but should have a more accurate lable. I wear women's size 8 wide and these gel socks were uncomfortably tight. I made a cut directly in the middle straight up on top of the foot (from toe to knee). This made it much more comfortable. Don't make too large a cut because it must be slightly tight or it will turn/slide off of your heel. The heel seems impermeable which is an improvement on regular socks. Slather on creams and it won't leak through and stain your rug or grease your floor. I add a little tea tree oil into my creams to kill germs as I wouldn't want to wear a sock over and over without really washing well. It's not a sock you would throw into a washing machine but you can gently hand wash. After wearing a few days I have decided a gel sock that covers the toes is better, as the ball of my foot and toes need loving too."
5,Wonderful for dry heels,"I have some of the worst dry heels I've ever seen - they dry to horrible fissures and sometimes spontaneously bleed. These ""half sock"" sleeves are wonderful and really help me survive the really dry winters in particular (in Colorado it's extremely dry in winter). I slather creams and lotions on my feet, but without these wonderful sleeves it is all to naught. Adding these sleeves over my creams/lotions allows them to soak in and do their work. Even without creams, these sleeves really help keep my heels in far better shape than they would normally be."
4,These actually work!,Work great. Cut off my circulation in my toes ever so slightly so if you have chubby or swollen feet I would not recommend. I have thin feet. Also the product created these strange skin filled fissures in my heels that take days of scrubbing to get out however my heels are softer for sure in one use.
2,Not convinced,"Living in Arizona dry feet is very common, so I read the reviews and thought I would give these a try. Not as great as some of the reviews said. The gel inside the socks does feel cool to the feet. Your feet are soft the morning to take the socks off but that is it. Dry and hard there after. The socks need to come in different sizes as well. To me it was a buzz kill."
4,Tight fit,Yes it does help and product makes a difference as described. The only negative issue and it is an issue is the tightness on the ankle. Wearing it all night creates a sizeable ridge on the leg...not good. My legs and ankles are not large. I remedied this by making a cut in the top edge of the sleeve. Once the tightness was eliminated the sleeve could be worn without causing a ridge. I did find having the calluses removed or taken down a bit did speed up the softening process. I was pleased with the result of the product.
4,Smooth,Received order as promise. It was package well. It was what I expected...will order again.When I tried this product I loved it. I order again.
1,Save your money,"After slight use, elastic frayed so badly at edges that these had to be thrown away. Only good for heel treatment. Much better choices out there."
3,Way too tight...,"I ordered these first and tried to wear them overnight but they were way too tight and my feet are around a ladies 8-8.5...a tad above average maybe but not huge - my ankles are small. I found myself ripping them off my feet in the middle of the night. They are very tightly woven and much stiffer than the other brand I ordered after I found I would not be able to wear these very long. I orderedOppo Gel Heel Socks, 6790 - 1 PairThey are much softer material and not nearly so tight and they have a soft, breathable part that is across the top of the foot. They are very comfortable and I forget I have them on. Both have the gel heel and that is awesome feeling on your cracked heels!"
1,You get what you pay for,"Bought this for the office about 5 months ago, only gets used about twice a week at most. The bake setting suddenly stopped working, you set the temperature and timer and nothing happens. Only the toast settings work...but who knows how long that will last. I'm shopping for a new toaster oven now."
2,Average quality,"Bought this model 5 months ago and it's toast function has stopped workingPros: Has enough room to fit in 4 pieces of bread, looks small and nice.Cons: Does not toast evenly, broke too soon.Even to get a replacement under warranty, I need to spend the shipping cost.Wondering if it is worth my effort to get a replacement (someone please suggest a better Black and Decker model that I can upgrade to !!! )"
2,disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this so I can make my daughter her chicken fingers quicker an healthier than deep frying. well i had it only a month now an when you close the door to turn it it doesnt turn on. you have to hold the door shut an hope for the best. i hate it an they should replace it.
1,Fire!,"The toaster dial didn't click down. Instead of returning to nicely toasted bread, the bread was on fire with smoke billowing out of the unit. Several weeks after I replaced the toaster with a different model, Applica sent me a new one."
1,timer for toast,"The timer for toasting did not work. That was the first thing I tried to do. The bread would toast but since the timer did not work, the toast would burn unless shut off the toaster."
1,Terrible Product,My toaster just died after a year and a half of use. We had another Black and Decker toaster oven for over 10 years. This one just stopped toasting the top of the bread.Mine is white and quickly tarneshed even after repeated cleanings. It looks like it old and at a year and a half its Toast.Hope this review will save you money and aggrevation.
1,BURN-OUT,This toaster oven is the worst I have ever bought! No matter the price being low. I burned my finger on the glass during first use just closing the cover due to poor design...I prefer my $7 Toastmaster Cool Touch Toaster! I am returning product immediately.
2,a little too hot,"I received this as a gift two Christmases ago. I picked it because it was smaller and more attractive than other similar products. From the beginning it toasted unevenly. Burning in the middle and undertoasting on the outside. There is no way to toast 4 slices of bread evenly. You have to be really careful that you don't overtoast. If you have used the toaster setting once and then go for a second round you have to turn the time down significantly. Works OK as an oven. Also, the handle slips off easily and can be difficult to slip back on when the glass front is hot. With some time you can learn to use this toaster oven...if you learn how it will behave. Not nearly as nice as the previous toaster I owned from the same company...it was no worries. I wish I had gotten over the old look of it and kept it."
4,nice toaster oven,I've been using this oven for a couple weeks now..everything seems to work well so far. I like the timer..keeps me fromburnng dinner. I sleep easier too knowing i didnt leave it on.
2,Not so much,I've had several toaster ovens over the years and ordered this one without seeing an actual one in a store. I'm a bit disappointed. It seems to leak out a lot of hot air through the front - wasting energy...and the set up for toasting is odd - I never remember how to set the other 2 dials. It seems complicated for no good reason. I would not buy another one.
1,FIRE HAZZARD,"I picked this model not for price but for function. It is one of the few models on the market that provide a wide range rotary dial for toasting times. That's the good news.The bad news is awful:1 - It gets VERY hot on the outside. We can deal with that. Barely.2 - The rotary timer will sometimes just stop, allowing the toaster to get hotter and hotter with no shut off. If I hadn't been in the room when this was going on, I strongly expect the unit would have caught itself or its surroundings on fire and burned down my house.This product is a disgrace to B&D;."
1,Junk,"Do not waste your money. I failed to check Amazon reviews before purchasing this unit. It was a great price, but a useless unit."
1,DO NOT Buy This Toaster - Fire Hazard,"I bought this toaster oven because it was inexpensive, small, had the features I wanted, and matched our kitchen decor nicely. Black and Decker is usually a reliable brand. BIG mistake - I should know by now that you should research all products, no matter how cheap, before buying.We have had this toaster oven less than a year. It functioned fairly well for several months, although it did get too hot on the outside and was not particularly sturdy. Then the toaster timer quit working properly - it would continue past the zero and the oven would not turn off unless unplugged. We have been continuing to use it since then (plugging and unplugging it, burning a few items) until we could look into fixing it. But after reading these reviews, I realize how dangerous this could be and will be buying a different toaster."
1,EXTREMELY DANGEROUS OVEN,"Do NOT buy this toaster oven. We bought ours approx a month ago. Yesterday it caught on FIRE. Literally. Apparently the ""toast timer"" bell rang, but the oven stayed on. Thank God for our smoke alarm in the kitchen, because I had stepped outside for literally a couple of minutes to check on my Husband, and then heard the smoke alarm. I unplugged the oven, and hucked it out into our driveway. Our cabinets are slightly burned, and I'm thankful that's all.I'm now noticing from other reviews that this is not a UL listed product. I am horrified that dangerous products like these are being made under once valued names like Black & Decker.Today we are going to try to find a nice regular toaster made in the US."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this unit just over a year ago. I noticed a couple of months ago that the coils weren't toasting evenly, so I carefully arranged bread to get them evenly toasted. I love the look of the item and it was the only toaster oven I found small enough for my kitchen.Last night I set the timer and left the room. Then it actually started smelling as though a fire had taken place. The top of the unit is now singed. Then I stubbornly used it again tonight keeping an eye on it and keeping the heat down. I could see flames emitting from that coil.So I came here and found all these other horror stories. I feel so bad because this is my 3rd Black and Decker Toaster Oven in over 30 years. The others lasted 15 years, this barely 1.Very sad indeed."
1,all right for toast,"Even at the low price, this machine is not worth the money - you will pay more for the electricity it requires to bake a potato - over two hours! As far as I can tell, the convection part of the oven is only in someone's imagination."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this toaster when my toaster of 13 years died. My kitchen is white so I was limited in choice. I chose this one because the features were similar to my old one, it was white and it wasn't huge! BIG WASTE OF MONEY. Like many others have commented, it gets extremely hot. I have tried to use the broiler oven feature and it does not maintain its temprature so you can't really use it to cook small oven items. Basically a piece of junk. I am glad it was cheap because I really would have been upset! Black and Decker should be ashamed of this product. One star is being generous!"
3,Detached.,"Julie Doucet, My Most Secret Desire (Drawn and Quarterly, 2004)I might have appreciated this book more had I known its contents beforehand. Not the explicit, disturbing nature of them (come on, my movie collection includes most of the Guinea Pig films AND the first two Men Behind the Sun films), but the disconnectedness (this is a dream journal, not a graphic novel) and fragmented language. The disconnectedness is an easy enough thing to which to adapt, though the pieces here are, well, dreams, and therefore often have no traditional structure whatsoever. The consistent misuse of English, however, is absolutely maddening. If your English isn't all that great, not a problem: work with a translator. There are a lot of wonderful translators out there.Amusing at times, but be warned. **"
4,An improvement over the first installment,"This is a good collection of tripped-out stuff, more consistent than volume one. Lobster is a great track as are Mad Blunted Jazz, After Dark and Das Land. Enjoyable and recommended."
5,A Rare Find,"This book really is a rare find. It does not help that it has sort of a mis-leading title. It is not a drafting and design book. This book is full of gems of knowledge for anyone interested in specing-out manufacturing machinery. The book is full of pointers on how to run a project, explains common costing techniques, how to avoiding common pitfalls and the latter half of the book discusses the pros and cons of various motor drives, control systems, sensors, stepper motors versus servo motors.It is rare to get all this information in one book. A quick overview that allows one to quickly grasp the basics and decide what is the proper mechanism for the ""design"". A very valuable book to obtain the basics of automated machinery. Very well written with good illustrations."
3,Target wouldn't replace,"I really liked this changing pad for the short time I was able to use it. After a month or so of use a hole developed along one of the seams. I requested that Target replace it but because we had purchased the pad in advance to having our son, Target said that their 90 replacement policy wouldn't warrant a replacement. The pad works well if you are lucky enough to get one made with strong vinyl seams."
2,not the best choice,"I thought this would be a good idea because it was deflatable and therefor easily portable. But when we tried to blow it up, it wouldn't inflate- not by mouth, by pump or otherwise. The valves were defective and sealed shut. Not wanting the hassle of returning it for yet another perhaps working replacement, we chose to puncture the valves to let us inflate the pad. It worked but unfortunately, one of the sides leaks now. A patch didn't help. The pad skids on the changing table surface and the belt would honestly not do much to keep a baby on the pad- it would just keep the pad on them while they fell to the floor. Would NOT rely on it. The terrycloth cover pills quickly and looks ratty very soon after use. My 3 and a half month old son is 24"" long and he is already outgrowing it lengthwise. I will get a sturdier pad for an upgrade."
5,It Looks Good,It looks good. The terry cover is a plus. We expect that it will do a servicable job once the baby arrives.
2,unwatchable and boring!,"I was hoping for a good thriller, but this DVD was hardly watchable. First of all, it takes forever to get going and then of goes nowhere. Really, the story is lame and it seems like those who wrote the story were constantly changing their ideas as they went along. Anyway, it was tough ever getting through such an uninspired movie. Therefore, don't waste your time on this one!"
2,GINA -WHEN WILL YOU BE GIVEN A GOOD SCRIPT !,"This film is AWFUL! Once again Hollywood misuses the amazing talents of that ""MOST BEAUTIFUL and SENSUAL"" of actresses,GINA GERSHON.LOVED GINA but HATED the film/THe two-star rating was for GINA,she is ALWAYS GREAT."
2,sort of blah...,"The other reviewers did a nice job describing the plot so I won't do it again. I just wanted to add that I had no issue with Nicholas trying to seduce Kit. Sometimes regencies are too sweet, the heroine being too innocent. Kit here knows a thing or two which is interesting in a regency. However, Nicholas seems a bit slimmy. A rake sure, most regency heros are rakes. So that is nothing new. But the impression of him being a slim never goes away. And, yes, a week to prove to Kit that he is trustworthy? The Duke and his wife and sister-in-law are also typical, the evil nobles and all that. So really, nothing new in this book."
4,Great product!,"Who would have thought!!! What a neat product. They work great, do a very good job of adhering!"
5,The Perfect Partnership,"This is an awesome, remarkable, Arch de Triumph memorial in the evolution of ballet. This is a must have, an approach to the sublime."
1,This DOC was longer on PBS,"I vividly remember watching this documentary in about 1993 on PBS. The documentary has about 30 extra minutes that is not included on this release. It went into greater detail about the final years of Fonteyn and Nureyev's partnership (even footage from these years). For some reason, BBC documentaries are often trimmed when released onto DVD/video in the States. It would be nice if this would be released."
2,"Love the concert, got the wrong Region DVD","The concert is just simply great.... Anytime, I am a little down, I play Elvis Lives and always feel better... I have recorded excerpts from PBS. Wanted the whole concert on DVD, but I received the wrong 'Region' DVD. I am told it will be replaced, but nothing yet after a month. Still hoping for the best. If you order any DVD, in the States we are Region 1."
1,A disgusting book. A huge disappointment,"This is the first (and probably last) book I read from Sigmund Brouwer. It is just vile in so many places in graphic descriptions of torture, amputations, and other physical abuse. At many points I thought about just quiting, but I hoped it would have some redeeming value. I was wrong. I should have not continued reading. I found the story line poor, rather like a bad episode of a cheap sci-fi movie. The characters are unbelieveable and the ending is terrible. I found nothing uplifting or encouraging, or of value. It is just a disgusting book that should never have been published by Word. I was really disappointed. It would fit in much better into a horror genre with some secular publisher. The few references to God or spiritual matters seem tacked on and not appropriate. I wish I had not read this book."
5,Will Make You Dance,"Very moving house tracks. If your feet dont move to this, you're dead. This CD will pump your party..."
4,Designed to catch attention,"Such effusive praise thus far. Well, at the risk of spoiling the author's perfect record I would add a couple of points:1. a book on making a good impression in print sets the bar quite high. Therefore, a publication of this type shouldn't have typos. It does - pages 12 & 13 for those with a wish to validate.2. the cover - design to draw attention rather than to sell - is a design best kept in the bookshelf rather than on display.3. Smarmy pedantry aside? The book is excellent and provides a clear introduction to design and how Microsoft Publisher can fill the need to develop that design. However, it clearly could do with some additional examples. I'm not against a consistent message, per se, but the author could well have done with some variations upon his theme of using his 'Design to Sell' newsletter. Additional views of different styles would have done wonders to improve the value of the message in this regard."
5,breathe right strips,my husband says these work great with his snoring and opens up his airway so much better than the generic brands..we will be buying more of these so I can get more sleep..
4,Does the job,"No complaints, I use this whenever a bad case of scalp itch breaks out and it never fails. I will be ordering this again."
3,"Works great for instant, short term relief","The itch relief lasts less than 24 hours. Since the product does nothing to eliminate the underlying cause of the itching, reapplication is inevitable. Have to wonder why it isn't offered in bulk. Next step: investigate pet products for more economical solution."
3,its ok,i dont think it works for me. after i wash my hair it work for the first day or 2 when using often but it does not last or work for me
5,Must Have Book For Your Business Libary!!!,This is truly an incredible book. It is only 165 pages in length but full of valuable lessons that can be applied to daily life.I would highly recommend purchasing this book for your library.
3,Good but ..but not that good,It's a good book but not what i expected honestly.. its too repetitive... much of what bob says works i wont discuss that but there's something missing like its not complete..if you're interested in the subject of persuasion and negotiation I would recommend you roger dawson's ''secrets of power persuasion'' its a way much better book than this one..
5,Fantastic!,"I would highly recommend this book and his ""Endless Referrals"" book to anyone who owns a business or is in sales. I was new to Chamber of Commerce and networking meetings, and Bob's books allowed me to step in and have at least a five-fold better impact from those meetings. Quickly become an influencer in your city! Bob Burg's books can help you gain a competitive edge and be more profitable."
5,Winning Without Intimidation; A must have guide for life,"I have read the book by Bob Burg and found it to be the most helpful tool for positive living. This is a must for dealing with people in today's world. It is easily read and explains why the techniques are necessary and gives clear examples of how they can be used in your everyday life. I attended a conference, where Bob Burg did an excellent presentation, at The Grand Plaza Hotel, Grand Rapids MI. He personifies his book."
2,below expectations,"This book was not what I expected, and did not provide much new insight instead quoted other books throughout. I also did not care for the way it read, almost like a journal instead of organized points, subjects and chapters. I was hoping for advice on effective communication and overcoming fears, intimidation and lack of confidence for personal and business situations and it fell far below my expectations."
1,Boring,"Lacking citations from science and psychology. Are these principles supported, or just opinion?"
1,A waste of time,"Quaintance deserves so much better than this semi-literate, overpriced trade paperback with a color cover and NO color inside, just lame black-and-white reproductions of his work. I bought it expecting to learn something about his life. There was nothing but some misspelled generalities (two or three pages of uninformative text), and while die-hard Quaintance fans may want to get this book, they might instead write to Taschen and beg them to do justice to this underrated talent! Pathetic."
2,Returned,"I returned the item and did not purchase . I had no problems working with the dealer , I just wasnt interested in the merchandise after recieving it , wasnt what I was looking for ."
3,"Great band, mediocre collection is NOT REMASTERED","First off, I'm a major Spooky Tooth fan and advocate and have been since my mid-teen years. This is a randomly assembled collection that ends up revealing little of the cohesiveness of any of thier original release albums.These are NOT REMASTERED recordings, in fact this transfer sounds hissy and very poorly e.q'ed.I buy anything available from the 'Tooth because it's all great music but this is not the disc to begin with. This will proboly confuse the new listener more than win them over.If you live on a desert island and this is the only Spooky Tooth available from the local Palm Tree record store then buy it, otherwise go for Spooky Two; The Last Puff; or any of the other releases first."
5,Wonderful performance,"i have yet to meet a cd or dvd of this ensemble that was less than excellent, and this DVD is no exception, from beginning to end you will enjoy this one very greatly, I thoroughly recommend it to all"
5,A Wonderful Collection of Herbert's Poetry,"Unlike Byron or Coleridge, George Herbert did not write epic poetry, but rather short religious vignettes which I find very pleasing. As a Christian, I find his quiet devotion to God enjoyable (let alone exemplary).I compared this particular anthology to a volume of Herbert's complete English works. This book contains all but four or five of Herbert's poems. It also lacks an extensive biography that the complete volume contained. I chose this edition over the other on account of its compact size -- truly small enough to fit into a larger side pocket. The poems are well-spaced out and the print is very clear.Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys religious poetry."
5,Good practical knife: Leatherman e301,"This knife means business: small and light enough to carry anywhere, and still tough enough for all that you can bring to the table. With the serrated edge, and the blade launcher, this knife is very practical in use. With one swing you open the knife with one hand while it instantly locks to avoid folding back.It's exactly what I expected of a high quality Leatherman knife."
5,"Sturdy, pretty, inexpensive","Sturdy, pretty, inexpensive. I got this as a gift and it was everything I hoped it would be. Thanks, Jim Clift Design!"
4,Not for the weak of mind!!,"Mind-twisting book about alternity, alternate dimensions, agents, normals, and of course--OX."
5,unbelievable!,"what a super album! it's quite mellow and beautifully done! i've had hundreds of CDs, and this is easily in the top three. it amazes me that it hasn't caught on. you won't regret buying it if you're looking for mellow, perfect acid-jazz."
3,Good book,"Good book, b ut I bought it by mistake. Meant to get the one on older cars. Still it's a good reference book."
3,american cars 1946-1975,it wasn't what I had expected from previous write ups that I had read about this publication. I was disappointed after going thru this book.
3,REALLY GOOD MOVIE ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL,THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD TRY IT OUT AND YOU WILL ENJOY IT TRUST ME YOU WILL
2,The Peasants of Languedoc,"While I got this book at a great price, I dislike the fact that it has large sections highlighted in blue. These may have been important passages for the previous reader, but I find them a distraction. I'd like to know in future if the book has sections highlighted to this extent and in bright colours. I don't mind notes in the margins..."
3,So so,I typically only purchase Fila athletic shoes. I like the appearance of these shoes but they are not very comfortable. No cushioning inside and they are very stiff which could possibly change after wearing them in.
5,a great resource,"I was amazed at the thoroughness of this book. The author concentrates on mid-range boutique-type hotels that are a good buy for the money. She even includes web site addresses so you can view photos of the building, lobby, and rooms. In fact, I cross-referenced this book with hotel websites, and found a great little hotel. The added bonus of shopping hints at the back of the book is a nice touch. However, the rough sketch maps of neighborhoods (the chapters are divided by neighborhood) were far from helpful - not easy to match the book's maps to, say, a Michelin map of the city. Highly recommended as a resource for truthful hotel information; and the author obviously loves playing detective for details such as renovation of rooms to include ensuite bathrooms. Recommended!"
2,resting on its laurels,"It's been six years since the last edition of this book. I used it in Paris recently and although one could get a sketchy idea of cheap accoms six years later (probably more like eight years given research and publishing lag), I would really like to see this guide updated more often.I don't blame Sandra for this, it's probably the publisher being stingy. But the out-of-date book is soiling the reputation of both author and publishers, I'm afraid."
5,Great costume,"My son loves this little costume. He wore it for Halloween 2010 and was the cutest little soldier out there. It is very durable and great quality. You could also roll the pants up or leave them down to fit various sized kids or to make it last longer. The hat is great quality, too, and can be worn with or without the costume. Great buy!!"
5,Best rock album of 2000,The world was denied a brilliant band when Liquid Gang broke up. Fortunately some of the members have gone on to other bands such as Planetary and Ether Seeds.
3,A Little Bit of Dissappointing,"Good music....good songs and the production is up to par, but there isn't really much there. Some songs recorded as well or better elsewhere, and not enough new in terms of the music or the performances to merit a recording. I wish Rodrigo & Gabriela all the best and their music is inpired and inspiring, but hope for more next time."
4,Live in Manchester and Dublin,"This is one of Rodrigo and Gabriela's early live albums and their metal roots are evident throughout, but with their own unique flamenco twist. This was recorded in Manchester and Dublin and has tracks from Re-Foc on it, as well as an excellent interpretation of Metallic's `One'. At one point this is blended with Brubeck's `Take Five' to delightful effect. This live album shows all the flair and passion in their playing and the part at the very end where Gabriela talks to the audience about her experiences in Ireland is especially endearing. If you enjoy their albums and want to sample their sound whilst playing live then this is a pretty good place to go, but be aware there is also an excellent `Live in Japan' disc to enjoy at some point as well.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1,doesn't work,I bought this cd for my husband as a christmas presents and it doesn't work. almost all of the tracks skip. it did arrive in a timely manner.
4,Hard,"This is not the pretty house music one may expect from Richard ""Humpty"" Vission. This is serious, hard, bangin' house music which does not include a lot of song samples. I recommend it for its sheer power and subtle shifts."
4,Easy to carry around.,I like the convenience of this small diaper bag. I wish it were a tad bigger. It is had to get my VentAire bottles in and out of the sides. That is even when the bag is not full. I do like to use this on quick trips to the store. I did buy disposable changing pads for extra room in this bag. It is so limited in space if you try to place a changing pad inside.
1,Children's Music,The music is a little too slow. The children in the program didn't care for the lyrics.
5,The very best of the Faust seventies albums,"Absolutley indispensable buy. Faust was and is still ahead of his time. The krautrock band evolved to more astructured music than on the first one debut album. Still has the classic touches of avangarde, experimentalism and good germnan rock. The mini lp replica is a fantastic reproduction of the original, and the sound is much clean. Hope they do the same replicas for the Faust-Tapes, Munich & Elswhere and Last album ."
3,Hits and misses,"Compared to their better known next work IV, this feels at times like a thrown together ""notice me"" sort of release which indeed has a share of musical success and perhaps production innovation, though suffers from sometimes aimless experimental indulgences, and coarse transitioning in what sounds like identity crisis for the group, vacillating between classic, psychedelic, and progressive rock not as graceful as their Kraut rock pedigree would suggest."
3,storage,"The unit was a much smaller than I had anticipated but is well made and it secures well to the truck and does not affect the seat at all. It fits well into the alloted space.I did not return this item, but I am not really sure if it is worth the price."
5,best work to date.,"this is by far there best work to date. dont get me wrong there earlier cds were good but this one takes you on a pure sonic journey. great work guys, cant wait for the next project."
4,Pendragon - Moving In A Slightly Different Direction,"Another four years elapse before Pendragon release this one. Pendragon has often been criticized for being stuck in a bit of a 70's progressive rock musical rut over the years. With ""Believe"" the band move in a somewhat different direction and it is probably the most modern sounding album of their career. Keyboards appear to be downplayed significantly here, compared to earlier efforts, and Nick Barrett's guitar and vocals seem to be the focus. The lyrics tackle the subject of human belief systems and do not contain as much of a fantastical element fans may be used to. This is another very good Pendragon release and might even appeal to progressive rock fans that have not gotten into the bands prior releases. Pendragon are definitely moving forward with this release although it may depend on your point of view as to whether this is a good thing or not."
2,I don't,"2 1/2Another neo-prog predictability (isn't that a contradiction itself?). There are a few song sections that cut through the pompous presentation inherent in the genre, but the majority of watered down rock complexities and spiritual ruminations usually put one in that detached state, prone to jadedness- ironically the opposite of what many modern progressive bands are going for."
2,NOT THAT GREAT,"PCN DOES A TERRIBLE JOB ON THE EDITING AND PRODUCTION ON THESE BATTLEFIELD WALKS..RANGER JOHN HEISER, ALTHOUGH NOT A REALLY EXCITING KIND OF GUY, DOES COVER SOME GOOD INFORMATION ON THIS BRIGADE..MOST OF THE THINGS THAT HE IS POINTING OUT ON THE FIELD YOU CANT SEE ANYWAY BECAUSE I THINK THE 13 YEAR OLD THAT SHOT THIS HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON..A LOT OF PCNS PRODUCTIONS ARE THE SAME WAY..KINDA LIKE INSTEAD OF TAKING FOOTAGE OF THE PEOPLE READY TO FALL OVER IN THE HEAT YOU MAY WANT TO PAN TO THE AREAS THAT THE RANGERS ARE TALKING ABOUT..YOU CANT FALUT THE RANGERS FOR THAT BUT SOME OF THE RANGERS ARE TERRIBLE..THE BEST ONES THAT I HAVE SEEN ARE DONE BY ERIC CAMPBELL..FIRST SHOTS AND CEMETERY HILL.HE AT LEAST HAS INFORMATION AND MAKES IT EXCITING TO WATCH AS HE TELLS THE STORY.."
3,This is a first grade basal reader.,This is a First Grade basal reader. Because it is nine years old it tends to follow the whole language philosophy of reading. The stories at this level are as entertaining as they can be and the children enjoy them.
1,Wishing it doesn't make it so,"This book so wants to demonstrate that music was a crucial component of human evolution, as if the author, Steven Mithen, wants to explain why he felt the subconscious need to spend so much money on CDs by Queensryche, but he ultimately fails to prove causality. There is nothing inherent in music creation that helped the human species survive the ravages of hunger, disease, pestilence, and war. There was no ""battle of the bands"" being waged on the prehistoric Serengeti plain to demonstrate defiance of environmental pressures to adapt. Much of this book is pure conjecture, and Mithen again demonstrates that scientists are the worst group of people to explain music to anyone."
1,Inaccurate,"This book has several serious inaccuracies. Particularly poor is the section on reimbursement for rehabilitation units. I am the nursing director of a rehabilitation unit and am able to spot problem after problem with this chapter. The book's subject matter is a welcome blessing because there is not a lot out there on post-acute reimbursement. However, the book cannot be relied upon for factual information and the interpretation of the law."
5,review#487320724577-4244-5478445275421910069359284574682,"They're back for another round with their second album. This album flows really well but is not a huge departure from their first,but the progression of their experience and style are still visible and exciting. What makes this one one of my personal faves is the cover of ""PINK FROST"", a bone chilling recreation of a very intimate song originally by a band called The Chills. A Total Let Down is far from that on a consumer scale. Even your pets will dance to this one!"
1,Not Nearly As Good As Advertised,"This product did not do the job on the small burn mark I had in my kitchen when I moved out of an apartment. It was difficult to use and was basically just a way to paint on top of vinyl flooring. I would not recommend this product for anyone, it was a huge let down."
2,Not worth the money,Although it is a good idea it is very confusing. They give you very little instructions and the colors are almost impossible to match to anything you use at home. Unless it is an original color forget about this product. But that is the manufacturers mistake they do not give you enough instructions.
1,Horrendous!!!!,"This product was a big disappointment indeed! Very limited vocabulary, not too user friendly, not to mention the horrible and not at all accurate pronunciation of the Portuguese word. Also, when installing the battery, the compartment broke into pieces. Very fragile and not assembled in a practical way. In all, a total waste of your money."
2,Indian Lounge Music,"There was a brief flurry of interest in the sitar during the late-'60s/early-'70s, reminiscent of the rise of fake-Hawaiian lounge music in the late-'50s/early-'60s. Both eventually devolved into Muzaky travesties of current popsongs, sure to sound the deathknell of any fad.While the late Ananda Shankar was one of the few practitioners with any real credentials, his solo album also marked the beginning of the end. There are a couple of pretty tunes (""Snow Flower"" & ""Metamorphosis"") one nice traditional raga (""Sagar"") and unfortunately a lot of dreck (""Light My Fire,"" ""Jumpin' Jack Flash,"" ""Mamata,"" ""Dance Indra,"" ""Raghupati"") hampered in no small part by extremely dated synthesizer sounds.While it's nice to see this overpriced collector's album finally reissued, it is by no means the zenith of the genre."
5,Excellent police series,"George Gently series is very,very well done.Most enjoyable.Please encourage the producers to produce more of them.I only wish the Northern accents were not so pronounced."
5,Loving Gently,We are THRILLED that we found the George Gently series !!!!!!We have literally 100s of British Dectective programs and the acting and writing in GENTLYare among the Very BEST !
4,VERY ENTERTAINING,My husband and I enjoy the english mysteries. George Gently Series 2 is very good and entertaining.
5,so sweet! so beautiful!,"this is a fantastic pieces, so sweet, so sad, so beautiful. You can listen their beautiful melodies by flute, some string, acoustic guitar and Gedge's vocal.Let's play!!"
3,Not good sound quality,Disappointed in quality even though I knew going into this that it would be the original version. After years of listening to great quality on other recordings it's a little hard to hear this. It is very authentic from the actual Woodstock event if that is what you are looking for. I wanted it because that era was a big part of my life and my friends attended.
2,Live performance quality,"Quality of the live performances not naturally as polished as studio recordings. I have the ""studio"" version of many songs in this CD and got used to its better quality so was unable to appreciate this live CD as much."
1,WOODSTOCK ORIGINALSOUNDTRACK,"ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK WOODSTOCK (NOT REMASTERED)PICTURE & SOUND IS NOT VERY GOOD,THE FORMAT (WIDE SCREEN) IS SO SMALL EVEN ON MY 60"" TV."
4,Not just for cops,"I originally bought this boot at a local motorcycle expo. Unlike my previous Redwings, these boots are light! I found these to be the first boots I could comfortably wear to ride AND walk/hike so I don't have to carry extra shoes with me. I have wide feet and these fit without pinching (like a lot of women's shoes). Now after 3 years of everyday use, one zipper finally gave up so I'm back in the market."
3,Comfortable,Comfortable and lightweight. Fabric is pulling away from the leather at the seams. Expected them to last longer than they did.
4,Good acid jazz.,"This cd is very good overall. Most of the tracks are great for setting the chillin, kick back mood. A few, such as ""What's That"" and ""Our Man in Havana"" have made it on to my favorite compilations and for this alone it has been worth the money."
3,Shayla,So I only bought this cd because my parents know Shayla and I've met her a few times. Also I like her Vietnamese stuff. But I've never really liked her American songs. It's not that she has a horrible voice or that the songs were bad it's just that they don't mix well together. Her voice is amazing (with Vietnamese songs) & the songs are incredible (but maybe if someone else sang them). Her accent is really deep so it throws the music off whack. Also she performed for my mom's Asian show not that long ago and I found out that she doesn't even sing Vietnamese songs anymore. She's die hard trying to break out into the American music industry. Good luck to her because it's been almost 4 years now. But I guess every one has there opinions...
5,If You Only Believe...,"Although this is Shayla's first ""American"" CD, she made a fair effort and should be recognized for rising to a higher level of performance. Although she may not have the voice of American singers, she continues to bring passion into her music. Shayla is also a song writer. She co-written various tracks into this cd, making it more on a personal tone. Although this is not our vision of Shayla, it is her dream. Although she may never have sold out concerts, she did make her dream come true. I respect Shayla for believing in herself. The songs on the CD are not bad as well, they just do not showcase her voice in a higehr level, but the passion she has for her music is real. Give this CD a try..."
1,horrible,She tries too hard to sing when she can't even sing at all. I can hear an accent in most of her singing so her voice isn't clear and melodic as most singers are. I am very disappointed that she was chosen to be the first Vietnamese artist to sell her Album in the American music industry. She was chosen on the basis of looks and not talent. There are plenty of better singers out there.
2,Could be better,"I first bought this CD in high hopes for a Vietnamese/American entertainer to break through the American music industry. [ I was] disappointed. Not only were all the songs mediocre and bland, it seems that the guest collaborators (Martin, her mom etc.)sound better than her. . The lyrics are a tad on the sappy side. I gave two stars instead of zero, only because I know she made a heartfelt attempt and that she did it for her fans. I give props for artists who do it for the people. I think the only people who would support this cd are Shayla fans from Asia Entertainment and... well, that's about it."
4,trouble inflating but great once that was done,"Somenow this was much more difficult to inflate than I was lead to believe, and I finally had to go to a retail store and have them do it with their pump. Now it is great."
4,Jazzstep to Hip-Hop to ect.,"Sorry Jeff, but like the man said, ""it ain't trance"". I feel bad for all these jazz heads who get sucked in to titles like this. Obviously they are unfamiliar with the bravado of the techno scene and it's producers. This album is really about good solid electronica of all types with a jazz influence. Quite danceable and ""chillable"" at the same time. A perfect album on a lazy Sunday for old techno geeks like me who are tired of the genre conformity of the ""new"" school clubs and undergrounds."
5,New Improved version now available - June 2009,"This was a definitive first-time issue of Starbuck's first album - when it was released in 2000. It also included 5 songs from their second album. (it's now out of print and selling at a premium)The Cherry Red / Broadside label has just issued both albums complete on one CD, with 2 great non-LP bonus tracks from the same period. The mastering and artwork/liner notes are excellent. The title is ""Moonlight Feels Right & Rock n' Roll Rocket"" (2009). (note: Bruce Blackman's ""Official Starbuck"" CD, with some jarring remixes and other alterations, borrowed the artwork from that new 2-fer)"
4,Space Technology Explained Understandably,"After World War II, there was increased interests in what would become space tecvhnology. Willy Ley was a popularizer of technology, and was an early rocketry enthusiast before World War II. Ley explained what many considered a very esoteric subject -- future space technology -- so that it was understandable to the general public.The book was a revision of his earlier books on rocketry. In it, he explains how rockets work, what is needed for transfer between planetary orbits, and the like, with virtually no higher masthematics, The fundamentals remain the same, and to this day, the basics still apply."
4,let's dance,"Debelah Morgan CAN sing. She's right up there with the likes of Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera. The material on ""dance with me"" is standard r&b/pop but at least Debelah co-wrote all of the songs (with her brother). The only track that sorta stands out is the salsa-esque ""dance with me"" but what saves the rest is Debelah's amazing voice. A good choice for any pop/r&b fan."
4,Very good.,"Debelah may be not very known in the U.S but shehas a big fan club following her in Europe.Her music is basically with a touch of R&B; which turns out to be very good and her voice helps her very much.She has a big hit that was a Top 10 in Europe, I'm talking about her first single ""Take the rain away"" if I could compare her with another singer I would say that she has the style and voice of Mariah Carey (when I heard her for the first time I thought it was Mariah).This album is from 2000 and has the hit singles ""Dance with me"" and ""Take the rain away"".Good try."
2,It's alright,"Debelah Morgan has a beautiful voice, but that alone isn't going to take her anywhere. After listening to this album I feel that her voice is being wasted. She needs to get some good writers and producers. The writers she's using now are holding her down from blowing up.."
5,It's About Time!!!,"If you missed out on Debelah's first two albums...fear not! Her new CD ""Dance With Me"" is her best effort yet, and sure to make Debelah a household name on everyone's lips. Dance With Me is true R&B/POP ear candy enjoyment. Debelah (and her brother Giloh) make a teriffic songwriting team, and subtly seduce the listener without overwhelming. If you like high notes, (and I mean HIGH) you will not be disappointed. Dance With Me showcases Debelah's range to it's fullest extent. My personal favorite songs include ""I Remember,"" ""Take The Rain Away,"" ""Think Of You"" and the title track. It's time to support an artist who writes and produces her own material, AND has an incredible voice. Special props must be given to Atlantic records for taking a second chance on this beautiful new diva, and for remixing ""Dance With Me"" for the club scene. Debelah--keep it up!"
4,Turn it up,"Debelah Morgan's album ""Dance With Me"" is always in my CD player (thank god it holds more than one!) Her voice is very talented and a pleasure to listen to. She co-wrote all of the songs, and that shows she isn't all about singing to words written for her by other people. While about 95% of the songs are excellent, there are a few the CD could do without. Personally, slow songs aren't exactly my cup of tea, but the ballads such as ""What Would You Do"" and ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" can get stuck in my head and it won't even bother me. Her voice is similar to that of Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, and at times, Toni Braxton. I certainly hope she'll gain more popularity than she has right now. She deserves a hell of a lot more respect from the media."
2,Not good........,"For some reason ive been wanting this cd. I thought it contained the upbeat version of I remember. But it didnt and i am highly pissed. this whole cd sucks, too many ballads."
3,DANCE WITH ME,"I REALLY ENJOY DEBELAH MORGANS ""DANCE WITH ME"" ITS A REALLY NICE SONG TO LISTEN TO ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE THE SPANISH BEAT WHICH I AM SURE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE.BUT......I DO THINK THAT ITS A LITTLE LIKE JENNIFER LOPEZ ""ON THE 6"" I AM NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN BUT I AM SURE MANY PEOPLE WITH AGREE WITH ME.I DO ALSO THINK THAT SHE IS ANOTHER WANNABEE DIVA LIKE THE OTHERS SUCH AS BRITNEY SPEARS,CHRISTINA AGUILERA,AND JESSICA SIMPSON JUST TO NAME A FEW.ONCE AGAIN I THINK PEOPLE WILL VERY MUCH AGREE WITH ME"
5,OH MY GOD,"Debelah Morgan has her own sound which no other act can compare(eg.mariah carey). Although her vocals has simalarities to Careys she has left a certain originality on this debut record which cannot be faulted and many others can agree. Her signature sound is her eighth octave screem which can melt the stoneist of hearts, and although her voice has still got to grow debelah when fully developed will take her to an international level at last, and I promise you will cement her as a musical force NEVER to be reconned with. The album on the other hand is full of amazing stand-out tracks like ""Dance With Me"", ""I Remember"" and ""Close To You"". This is the best debut album I have heard since the soaring tones of ""Mariah Carey"" but move over mariah theres a new diva in town!"
2,hose pot too small,This copper pot was lighter weight than I expected and was much toosmall for a 150-foot hose.
4,A Good Read!,"Author Alan Axelrod's 156 concise lessons on leadership from the life and writings of Harry S. Truman are vivid but, alas, often repetitive. The bigger paradox of this book is that many of the virtues it espouses - diligence, balance, thoroughness, patience and a thirst for learning - are thwarted by its very structure. Truman, a voracious reader, would likely have found these one or two page chapters frustratingly short. Any leader really seeking to model himself or herself on Truman should use this as an appetizer and move immediately onward to a meaty full-length biography or memoir. With that in mind, we recommend this book to executives and political leaders who haven't yet met Truman - or to those who only want a brief visit, a leadership pep talk and a few pithy quotes."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen. There was nothing good about it. The acting, the filming, the sound, the singing all bad. The only good thing was Hank's music but unfortunately it was very poorly performed. Maybe all the 5 star reviews watched a different movie, after reading all those reviews I was expecting something much better than this. This looked like a class project from a second year film student. Imagine how bad you think it could possibly be and it's worse."
3,"Honestly dont know what to say, it's good & bad!","Many mistakes, its nostalgic, yea but...Why insert so many non-sense, first you sing, you claim you dont drink, then you take break to drink, i mean it's an hour show, no need for break.The driver is some old freak, instead of 18 year old time wastin boy.Sure, it's filled with Hank's spirit but that's all.When hank sings final song, when it ends, it's midnight, actually, it should have been 12:15, he was on the stage over an hour.It would be good to add his real music in the beginning, especially restored Lost Highway would fit introduction well! This movie is otherwise great but many things need to be cut out, as I did for my ver, there's too much talking about nothing & anything much ado about nothin!"
4,Hank Williams The Show He Never Gave,A wonderful tribute to the great Hank Williams with a what-if story and a fan of Williams brings him to life. Waters brings this troubled star to life in a story that takes place on the night he dies. The DVD arrived early and looks great.
4,One Of The Better Ones,"This movie is one of the better ones about Hank Sr. Compared to ""Your Cheatin' Heart"" and the Jim Owens films its probably the best. A fairly accurate job on Hank by Sneezy, excluding the revival/church type stuff. Hank would have never done that. Being a Hank Williams historian of sorts, Id recommend this one to Williams fans but watch it with a grain of salt. (ie Hank never had drums on stage) :)"
2,Not among the convinced,"I had high hopes for this video as I love Hank Williams and think he was one of the last and best authentic country music people (unlike the plastic, blow dry, plastic surgerized men and women faking it in Nashville today). Country music today has been declawed and de#@%%@#, as has Latino music - all in the name of money and Clear Channel radio programming formats. I wish I could agree that Sneezy does a good Hank but I found his performance to be only vaguely reminiscent of our boy. Sneezy doesn't look like Hank except from a distance. His voice doesn't sound like Hank to me. His singing lacks Hank's straight from the heart charm, pain, and joy. The film is a bore and is cheaply filmed. If you can catch any of Hank's filmed appearances, you will see how he just lights up a stage. A disappointment."
1,Hank Williams The show he never gave,This was very poorly done. I am a big Hank Williams fan. I watched a few minutEs of this. It does not do justice to Hank
4,well done,"I thought that Sneezy Waters portrayal of Hank Williams was outstanding, both in looks and vocals. If you are a fan of old country music, this movie shoild not be missed"
4,this was fun,"There is a scarcity of material about Hank Williams out there. Not only was he a remarklable talent and a phenomenal success, his life story is fascinating. To understand the man, you have to piece all the fragments together and this video was an interesting piece. Very theatrical and done with an obvious affection. I will treasure it."
5,About ORS,"After listenin' to the audio samples there ain't no two ways about it ....you gotta have this album ! rite?Absolutleh!! This album features top picks in the best quality.But before you think you have stumbled upon a compilation of rare grooves you might wanna read this...This compilation as well as More Original Raw Soul, the sequel are both compilations of tracks by the Poets Of Rhythm, a band infact from the early 90's.Their signature sounds are based upon classic 60's funk so u might think u listenin' to some rare 45.Well you ain't ...but this is one of the greatest and possibly the only old skool funk bands of our time!This album is ""All Killer No Filler"" from start to end.And the highlights being ORFI&II; and Bag Of Soul.The original Santa's Got a Bag Of Soul can be sampled at www.jazzmanrecords.co.ukMay be a lill' hard to find at times because of Ltd. stock issues.....in such cases it's worth the wait!"
3,A ok gutiar,I love how it sounds but its small and when they say travle it does feel like a toy guitar but for 30 bucks what do you execpt accept something fun i bought it a couple of days ago i an intermedite gutiars pros this is not for you no pick gaurd and does dent sometimes but all i say is if you want a decent travel guitar for cheap buy this
4,Li-Young Lee uses imagery to evoke emotion.,"Li-Young Lee works as a commercial artist, and in his poetry, he paints masterful pictures in the readers mind. I believe that the ""stand-out"" poem from this selection is ""From Blossoms.""The idea of ""taking what we love inside, to carry within us an orchard"" brings a new sense of gratefulness for the memories and knowledge we have, and a profound sense of regret for the experiences, emotions, and knowledge we have missed.Don't miss the emotions that these poems will evoke in you. Read them, love them, and take them inside."
5,Amey3eb,"I have been a fan of Li-Young Lee for about four years. This started when I came across his poem ""Persimmons"" in an introductory to poetry class. ""Persimmons"" instantly captivated my attention. I bought his book of poetry ""Rose and I was not let down. There are several poems in ""Rose"" that I hold in high regards like "" Persimmons,"" such as ""From Blossoms,"" ""Ash, Snow, or Moonlight,"" and ""Early in the Morning,"" amongst others. Lee writes a lot about nature, fruit, his father, and coming to America from China and feeling like an outsider. Lee has a very artistic mind and is able to capture daily things and express it on paper in an imagery filled, non-traditionally detailed, lyrical way. He is one of my all time favorite poets and I would recommend ""Rose,"" to everyone."
5,Magnificent,"Li-Young Lee's poems are powerful, beautiful and speak to the humanity in all of us. I marvel at his command of language, the artists eye with which he sees the world, and his ability to share these with the reader. Writing about the mundane, such as his wife's hair or a bag of peaches, memories of his father, or reminisences of being an immigrant, in each poem is a work of art. I strongly recommend this collection of poetry, especially for those who who have read little (or none) poetry - these poems are simple, beautiful and striking - a magnificent collection."
3,Great Service but DVD inferior,"I received this item very promptly. However, the DVD quality is sub standard. It skips continually and jumps forward. This might be caused by formatting problems with the DVD and my player. I sure hope this disc was new when I purchased it."
5,swinging band!,"I picked this CD up in Rite Aid, and was thrilled to hear how great she sounds and how swinging the band was. I'm sure they are top jazz guys. This is my favorite Christmas jazz album after Dave McKenna's and Ella's ""Swingin' Christmas"". Beautiful recording - best version of Silent Night I've heard in a long time."
3,"Great Singing, Less Traditional","Let me say first off that Etta is one of the greatest singers in the world today. In spite of the discount packaging and lame cover photo, this set has her doing more great singing with a wonderfully talented band. This is her jazz band. (The liner notes have no credits at all so I'm guessing it's the same as her album Time After Time, which makes Cedar Walton the Arranger.) The production is top-notch, however the arrangements are just a little too jazzy for some of the songs. One finds one wanting her to sing some of these more close to traditional jazz standards. I was expecting something more like Nat King Cole, or even Diana Krall. The album ends with the carols. She sings a jazzy arrangement of Silent Night, and Joy To The World. With O Holy Night, the last song, she gives us a more simple, traditional arrangement."
2,Not her best,"I'm disappointed. Songs are slow, not upbeat as I would have expected. Doesn't get you in a joyful Christmas spirit."
2,At Last GASP,"Boring, unimaginative versions of holiday staples barely sung in tune by the lady who brought you some of the greatest soul and R&B gems of the 1960s, is very disappointing. Most of the band chops are good, if you like jazz solos between wheezing vocals, but I like blues. Santa James just doesn't sound very inspired and no matter how much you try to mask her voice, there is no hiding she has lost her range. After Linda Rondstant's holiday listen this year, this was the 2nd biggest let down in my holiday stocking."
4,Good for the money,You need your own mounting hardware. Except for that it's a fine item at a better price than most.
5,True Definition,It was interesting to learn how the word was misused by a historical group of people. This was of particular value for explaining the true meaning to students who think pride is the opposite of the original definition.
5,A Good Standard Biography,"This a a good standard biography written in 1959. It deals with life and works together and the circumstances of their creation. I would imagine that a LOT of scholarship has been done on Poe since 1959, but this is a readable work of 408 numbered pages - 31 chapters. Winwar also wrote biographies of Byron, Shelly, Keats, Oscar Wilde, and Walt Whitman."
2,A naive viewpoint,"Regrettably, this book purports to have inside knowledge of the television industry but its own content belies that assertion. Much of the material is self-indulgent, a direct reflection on both the author and members of VQT. As a television insider myself, who has had numerous run-ins with these self-proclaimed arbiters of ""quality"", their uninformed perspectives turn what should be a book about the strength of the little guy into a skewed narrative by a wanna-be outsider pretending to be an insider. Readers looking for true insights into the world of television are better off with another piece of material."
4,good solid collection,"a good solid romantic comedy pack for all, but they are have hugh grant so you must be at least able to tallerate him, i cant say i would have bought them all apart but im glad i have them, quality stuff especially love actually and about a boy fantastic and notting hill is classic, the reason i bought it. injoy n God bless."
2,Loved most of it. . .,"The other 3 dvds were great, but ""About A Boy"" won't play on ANY of my DVD players, or my laptop, or on my pc, or on my friends' laptops, dvd players, or pcs."
4,Good Collection,"This is a great collection of films. I love About a Boy, my wife loves Bridget Jones and we both like Love Actually. Notting Hill is passable."
5,Why Disasters are a disaster,"Excellent explanations on why the same errors in management occur over and over again in Disaster Response. After teaching incident command for a number of years and being frustrated because it was not being applied correctly in the field, it was a real education to read Dr Auf Der Heide's book.Shame it is out of print. Sure wish I kept my copy when I left the emergency response field."
5,excellent,"This book helps young children distinguish between telling stories, making mistakes and lying. It also covers lying by telling a lie, lying by not telling the truth and making amends for a lie. It points out how you undermine trust when you lie. Very simple words and layout with good pictures. An excellent book for the young on lying."
5,A Children's Book About LYING (Help Me Be Good Series),A charming book about lying -- I thoughtthe author did an excellent job of describingdifferent activities that were alwo lying.Granddaughter read the book to me and we discussed.I gave her the book to take home and read again.
5,Eat Humble Pie,"Humble Pie engages students with it's plot. After reading, it opens many educational possibilities(vocabulary,writing, social studies)."
1,"This is a horrible, badly written, unartistic book","If you have any appreciation for art, don't buy this book. Check the price. This is a short flimsly book, mailed to me in an envelope which got bent. You expect a book that is published to have some creativity, right? This book took 0 imagination and it was so poorly written that I am returning it. Don't believe the other reviews."
4,Please support these cats,"Alright all of you Dig Planets, Tribe, and Gang Starr fans stand up!! The SPs have put together some classic material. The collabrations are just sick!! All of the songs are fly but I'm lovin the Little Brother & Asheru of Unspoken Heard contributions. Please support these cats. If you enjoyed music from any of those cats I mentioned earlier, you will not be disappointed."
1,Fake-take with a grain of salt!!,"Rolling Thunder wanted his message out so he sought to write a book. According to his own family, the editor chose to falsify much of the information in this book. Despite his families pleas to the publisher the book was put into print without any changes. His family wishes for people to not support the lies being spread about Rolling Thunder through the purchase of this book. Many people are claiming to have been endorsed by Rolling Thunder when he was alive and are now making much money off of his teachings after changing what he said to fit their agenda and pocket books. While this book seems uplifting and encouraging as many of the reviewers have said, it is not Rolling Thunder. Just a word of warning."
3,What you think is not what it is...,"If you wanted a sequeal to Rolling Thunder's first book this is not it. This book represents itself as from Rolling Thunder but it is written by his second wife with the intension to make money from the coat-tails this great man's lessons. It is an interesting text, BUT what does one believe to be true? Stick with the real thing and Rolling Thunder is it. RT died from cancer and Rolling Thunder Speaks was written after his death. Read for entertainment but be aware what you take for truth, DO NOT QUOTE as from RT himself."
2,2 Steps Back.,Doug Boyd's book was the step forward.It is true that Carmen Sun Rising Pope promptly married my grandfather Rolling Thunder in his last and mentally muddled days. He died and Carmen took everything from my family. I don't recommend supporting her.I can tell you as his grandson I have not ONE item gained from Rolling Thunder's passing.But never mind all of that. Everything returns to earth in the end anyway. The point here is that I am soon releasing a Rolling Thunder book which will contain stories of RT never before read and anecdotes from people all over the United States who knew him personally. No one-sided perspectives here. Just the simple inner journey of a youth trying to piece together the real fact and the real fiction of Rolling Thunder.
3,you won't find the ending and opening theme songs on this CD,Eleven tracks of instrumental music from Batoru Fb Jei (Battle Fever J) the third sentai series and first to have giant monsters destroyed by a giant robot. This CD is number 39 in the Animex 1200 series of CDs made from out of print vinyl records. It contains 42 minutes and 25 minutes of music. Althought the first track does incoperate instrumental variations of on the opening theme the vocal theme from Mojo is not included. The last track likewise includes instrumental variations on the ending theme. Only a real Battle Fever J fenatic would enjoy this CD.
4,If you like dance music...,"If you like dance music you'll love this CD. Old, Italian songs backed by techno beats. A formula that's not suppossed to work...but does really, really well.The original songs are excellent also."
5,An uprising for the Italian American,"This cd is finally the italian answer to what's next in music, you hear it on the radio and you hear it in your head, it's catchy, it's fun, the vocals alone are worth it. I have yet the oppurtunity to see Angelo and the Sicillians live, but I know that when I do it will probably be a magical night of high energy entertaining."
5,It's About Time,"I totally agree with Mike of Toms River, NJ. It's about time that the Italians are heard on the radio. There is not enough exposure for Italians. This has to change. We have to surface and be heard. Everywhere we turn, it's always spanish this and spanish that. Where are the Italians? I am elated to hear our own music for a change on the radio (no matter what version or what lyrics) We, too, should have our own radio station that plays Italian songs all day long expressing our beautiful Italian language. These songs should/must keep coming. Don't stop releasing these songs, pleeeaasse. It is so great to turn the radio on and hear songs that bring back unbelievable feelings and memories of our culture and families. I am so proud to be Italian and these songs remind me of that."
1,I want REAL REVIEWS not FAMILY!,I understand some songs are good on the cd but some are just horrible and most of the reviews on this are coming from HIS FAMILY! on his website his family writes in the message boards. I know this for a fact i wanna read real reviews. I wasted my money to buy this cd meanwhile the original versions were better. Stick to the Singles of Ti Amo and L'Italiano.
1,ANGELO VENUTO? NOT.....,"Although the songs are pulsating and catchy you gotta be aware that the real vocalist is NOT this Angelo Venuto guy.... Who in the world is Angelo Venuto? Apparently he is NOT the vocalist! Being a true Italian here, I have collected hundreds of Italian records over the years. The songs ""L'ITALIANO"" and ""TI AMO"" are actually sung by Italian artist ""TOTO CUTUGNO"" from the early 1980's. They are original vocals just mixed in to modern day dance beats. Let's face it, credit should be given to the original artist. I can't believe this Angelo person is trying to pass himself off as someone he's not."
4,SOLID FOLLOW UP TO THE ORIGINAL! NEEDS A NEW DVD RELEASE!,"Watching 'True Grit' and This sequel back to back I was able to compare the films and their first releases. While I don't own the newest edition of 'True Grit' the version I own has a super picture and excellent sound. The sequel looks very good, but the print and transfer pale by comparison. The film is a bit grainy and should be revamped for a new release. The film however is very enjoyable with both stars in great form."
4,Rooster Cogburn,"A fitting sequal to ""true grit"", Kate Hepburn and John Wayne together, you cant lose....."
2,Great Movie...Horrible Transfer,"This is a great movie, but the transfer in this DVD release is horrible. Scenes look grainy and out of focus at times, what a shame given the gorgeous settings for this movie. Also notice lots of scratches, spots, etc on film....must have used the first print they pulled out of the vault. Better to record it on DVR when its broadcast on AMCHD or Encore Westerns and wait for a better release....barely worth $8. Considering the starpower of Wayne and Hepburn you'd think Universal would have done it better justice.....disappointing"
2,Wait for the Blu Ray,This is a disappointment. I really like this movie but it's framing on a big screen TV is horrible. Wait for the movie to release on Blu Ray.
2,"Wayne and Hepburn Take ""African Queen"" Route","The unique chemistry between John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn barely elevates a Western rehash of ""The African Queen."" Without Wayne and Hepburn, this belated sequel to ""True Grit"" would not pass muster as a made-for-TV movie. It's too bad Peter Bogdanovich didn't take up the Duke's offer to direct the project - he might have improved upon the routine script. This was Wayne's next-to-last Western, but he would end his career in a poignant blaze of glory with ""The Shootist"" (1976)."
5,Rooster Cogburn...And The Lady-DVD,"This is a very good follow up movie to John Wayne's Oscar Winning Role in the 1969 Classic,""True Grit"".John Wayne and Catherine Hepburn are great on screen together,and share a fine chemistry.The supporting cast is also excellant.The DVD contains some nice bonus features.The transfer quality is rather good for an older DVD title like this one is,but it very well deserves a much better,very high quality,re-mastered transfer to BLU-RAY.I recommend this movie to anyone that likes John Wayne westerns and action films."
2,Ole Rooster lacks true grit second time around,"The ""one-eyed fat man"" Rooster Cogburn is arguably John Wayne's best performance. It (from the movie True Grit) netted The Duke his only Oscar. However, the sequel Rooster Cogburn lacks the style and pinache of True Grit. This time out, Cogburn is on the trail of gunrunners who have stolen a Gatling gun and, in the process, have murdered Katherine Hepburn's father. Finding Hepburn gives this movie a pulse. Otherwise, it rambles aimlessly. The villians, or lack thereof, are another major defect in Rooster Cogburn. Unlike Robert Duval's ballsy Ned Pepper in True Grit, Richard Jordan's Brooklyn-tinged bark is much more annoying than his bite. And the rest of his gang is easy-pickins for The Duke. Luckily Hepburn's and Wayne's tit-for-tat antics keep Rooster Cogburn watchable. Otherwise, ole Rooster lacks the true grit that won him an Oscar the first time around."
1,Horrible picture quality,"This dvd is full of grain, black spots, holes and lines that appear throughout movie. I would not recommend to anyone."
3,Gift,Not one of my favorites but it was a Christmas gift. It is a good job done by aging Katherine Hepburn and a nice job by Wayne as a very crusty Cogburn.
3,Very good movie,Wayne's second last performance (The Shootist next year was his swan song) is one of his best remebered. The film is action packed with lots of humor too. I see nothing wrong with he and Hepburn in a boat together as that makes the film only more original as a western. And to the pompous poster who also complained about writer Hyer killing off Hepburn's brother in the movie: actor Jon Lormer played Hepburn's FATHER!!!!!!!
3,Rooster Cogburn (and the Lady),"This is a follow up to the Acadamy Award winning ""True Grit"" in which Wayne reprises his role as Rooster Cogburn. Location and photographics are great. Plot is pretty standard and does not offer any challenges to Wayne or Hepburn. Pretty much run of the mill for both these two..."
5,Great,Loved the movie. Great quality and came quick.Recommend the movie to you for your purchase.Any John Wayne fan needs this.
4,Rooster Cogburn DVD,"Very good reproduction of the original movie, an old favorite that enjoy watching over and over. I have quite a library of John Wayne DVD's and enjoy them all."
5,Wasted Plot??/ A very poor critic.,How were John Wayne and Katherine Hepburn wasted superstars in this movie? How is an old Marshall trying to prove his worth a dull plot? What an absurd review. Watch the movie. It is a touching story with an excellent supporting female character!
4,Great dialog exchange!,The story is only so-so but the exchanges between John Wayne and Kathryn Hepburn are wonderful and make the movie worth seeing. This had the potential to be really good.
1,"Great Movie, Horrendous DVD","John Wayne...Kate Hepburn...Strother Martin...how could it not be a great movie, but...the quality of the DVD couldn't have been any worse. Since this film is several decades old and stars many great actors, I do not need to review the film itself so I will stick strictly to the product and how it is presented. The transfer is terrible. The aspect ratio should be correct but it doesn't play right on a HD LCD widscreen TV. It plays in a small box with black bars all around and no amount of fiddling with the setup changes that. The film transfer is loaded with scratches and color drop-outs which is a shame because this film was beautifully shot in some amazing scenery. Don't waste your money , even at 4.99, on this movie. spend the extra dough and get a better transfer or wait until the Blu-ray release."
5,Rooster Cogburn,Old classic in DVD quality. WOW!!! Got to love the Duke and you have to buy this one.
5,Exquisite,"This has to be one of the finest vocal album releases of the 1990s. Maureen McGovern is the ideal interpreter of the work of the Bergmans. She handles each song with complete care and sensitivity, finding the inner emotional pulse of each number. The Bergmans' highly individual writing style is characterised by a wonderful feeling of romance and sensuality; they are in the traditionof the great songwriters beginning with Kern, Porter, Rodgers etc through to Stephen Sondheim, Kander and Ebb etc. However, their lyrics have an intimacy that is entirely their own. Listen to the exquisite imagery in ""Like a Lover""; or the generous human wisdom in ""Little Boy Lost"". Their words are matched by some of the most distinguished latter-day composers.Throughout, McGovern displays complete assurance with eevery mood and sentiment. She is abetted by great arrangements by the incredible Mike Renzi. A masterful tribute to a masterful team."
2,Was expecting better,"These are very pretty coming out of the box, a lovely burnt wine-stain. Very long handles, which is nice for deep pots. However, the color is really just painted on, as I found that with very normal use in deglazing pans and such, the end of my flat spatula starting chipping off and revealing the wood underneath. Not only am I a bit concerned about the safety of the color agent, I'm worried about possible splinters. Seductive pricing, but I wouldn't buy these again."
5,Pyrex Kitchen Utensils,"These are an EXCELLENT value, looked all over for these and found them on your site. Great service, fast delivery and I would definately buy from Amazon again."
3,"ok, if you like floral/botanical cross stitch","This is an ok cross stitch book. There are color photos of the finished charts. Most of the designs are botanical, but there are few others (a very simple teddy bear, and a very simple duck pattern)."
3,Perhaps a good starter book for a child?,"I like this book only a little more than the other reviewer. Yes, the designs are somewhat pedestrian but there are enough of them that you'd probably find you'd like to make. Because of the simplicity, this might be a good way to introduce kids to cross stitch...that's how we all got started, right? I own just about all of the Dover reprints of the Jana Hauschild Lindberg and Lindberg Press books and am usually enchanted with at least some of the designs in every book...with just a couple exceptions...like this one."
3,"Creative concept, but a little heavy-handed","Jefferson Scott has presented a plausible future reality with an intriguing and believable plot. His attempts to include the characters' thoughts and motives fell flat more often than not, however. Once this aspect of his writing matures, his work will improve dramatically."
5,Incredible sci-fi thriller!,"Anyone who likes fast paced action is in the right place. Good for people who are into computers and VR, but you don't have to know them to enjoy the book. You'll be on the edge of your seat! It's great to be able to read an interesting book where the main characters have morals and don't have to indulge in a lot of swearing, ect. I can't wait to get my hands on his other book!"
4,Really liked this movie.,"This movie is one of the few that I've come across that was in Bisayan instead of Tagalog. There are translations in English as well so more can enjoy the film. It has a nostalgic, remember how it was back in the days kind of feel to it. Good story. I'm glad I purchased it."
5,Great item,"We just moved into an apartment where we could not have a gas grill. We love to grill. This was the ideal answer to that. It is electric, compact enough to fit on our patio.Cooks great. We love it. We're back grilling on week-ends. Thank you. It was a very wise and good purchase."
4,George Forman Grill - Great for Small Groups,I've only used the George Foreman grill once but I was really happy with it. I grilled a flank steak and it came out perfect.
1,George Foreman Electric Grill,Didn't realize it was so small. Paid more for it than the one I bought as a gift which was much larger.Very disappointed.
4,GeorgeForman Indoor/Outdoor Electric Grill,"This is a very good product - perfect size for a small deck, perfect size for condo living. I use it on the deck and when winter comes, I intend to use it in our attached garage. Doing this will eliminate cooking odors within our living space (of 1650 sf). THERE IS ONLY ONE PROBLEM: There are no vent holes for steam to excape from the cover. My husband drilled a few holes at the top to let the steam excape. CAUTION: When lifting the cover, because the steam cannot escape, the steam can burn your hands, wrists, etc. Using a long pot holder mit can prevent this. The entire cooking portion can be submersed in water to clean. EASY CLEANING!(It cannot be put in your dishwasher, but the drip pan can.) Other than the no-steam-outlet, I LOVE this grill. The price is right. The packaging was perfect. Enjoy!"
4,Smaller than the original GGR50B,"I bought this to replace my 5 year old George Foreman Indoor/Outdoor Grill that just simply was used to death, and I loved it. This one is fine, but it is smaller than the original one (my first clue should have been the reduced price) and it is a bit harder to remove the grill plate to clean it. It has a clip underneath, for safety I suppose, but I find it awkward to remove. I really like the new one, too, but I am not happy it is so much smaller. It does fit into my sink for cleaning better than my old one since it is smaller. Just a warning if you are looking to replace the original model and want the same size, order GGR50B, not this one."
3,It's okay,"I really wish this was easier to clean. I thought that all possible new Foreman grills would have the feature where you can remove the silver plating and just wash those versus washing the whole thing.I had the newer Foreman grill where you could take the plates out and just wash those. You have less worry of getting something else wet besides the plate you need to actually wash.I've only used it once because it was so awkward to wash. The marinated pork chops were good and tender. It did suggest a heating time but I don't think it was cooked well enough. I had to insert one of those temperature forks in to make sure it was cooked.The assembly was easy. I did feel the cord was too short. Otherwise, it's okay."
4,versatile electric grill,Sits on removable stand. Easily used indoor or outside/ with domed cover.Comes clean easily. Probably takes 5 min. to cleanup. I have used forhamburgs and steak. I find it works well with or without the top. Goodvalue. I would give it 5 stars if it could be a bit hotter.
1,Not what I expected,"The grill doesn't seem to get hot enough. Although the surface is no-stick coated, because it cannot be submersed, it's not that easy to clean. There is no vent in the hood so steam drips all around the unit on the floor/counter."
2,RETURNED ITEM...DIDN'T LIKE IT.,RETURNED ITEM---DIDN'T LIKE IT.NOT AS BIG AS THEY SUGGESTEDFOR GRILL AREA.
2,Part problems,"Short review, this item is super !! Indoor or outdoor it performs well and my wife uses it alot, BUT the wind blew it over and cracked the two handles..have contacted every lead for parts with ""ABSOLUTELY NO REPLY OR ASSISTANCE"" Would not suggest a purchase with that issue unresolved !!"
3,disappointing,"I had purchased the original George Foreman Round Indoor/Outdoor Grill about 5 years ago. We were ready for our 2nd grill so I bought one. I was very disappointed. Our original grill was much better quality in the body. It allowed the user to take the grill out and actually wash it thoroughly if one was careful not to wash the plug unit. But the new one is just a cheap knock off of the original. The drip tray is in the new one is much better, but that is really the only positive comment I have on this grill."
3,Indoor/Outdoor Grill,"I am pleased with the functionality of the grill. However, upon opening the box one of the grill handles was cracked almost all the way from end to end. The cost to return the unit and the time that would have been wasted exchanging it would not have been worth the effort. I previously ordered a spinner bike on amazon and that was slightly damaged when I received it as well. Again the cost andtime to exchange it would not have been worth the effort. I neverhave problems when I receive lighter items but as this was the second time damaged goods were received I may have to reconsider ordering larger items through amazon in the future."
1,Not what I thought it would be!,I was looking for a small electric grill that would grill like my gas one. This is totally not it. This has a solid grill that has to be dismantled after every use to clean. It takes forever to cook and does not taste grilled ! I'm so disappointed. I would return it if I could ! !
5,GREAT PRODUCT - BEATS BUYING CHARCOAL OR PROPANE,CRANK THIS BABY ON HIGH AND YOUR STEAKS WILL BE COOKED TO PERFECTION IN MINUTES - JUST AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN CHARCOAL OR GAS - FROZEN CHICKEN BREASTS COOK UP TO PERFECTION ALSO AND QUICK! I PURCHASED 2 MORE FOR PRESENTS AND HAVE TOLD EVERYONE HOW GREAT THIS GRILL IS - 3 OTHER PEOPLE I KNOW ARE BUYING ONE AFTER THEY ATE THE STEAKS I MADE!CLEAN UP IS AS EASY AS A WET PAPER TOWEL.BUY THIS - YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.
5,He loved it!!!!!,"I got this grill for my father on Father's day.He loved it, considering he's a outdoors type individual.I truly recommend this as a gift and the recipient will really appreciate it."
5,Wow!!! This is an awesome product!,I have been thinking about getting this for awhile since my mother has one and I was quite impressed with it. First...I love that it is very compact and I can remove it from the stand to put on the counter top. And having this is going to encourage me to grill more things than fry them. I don't know why I waited so long to get this. For the price and quality it is worth every penny!
2,too bad replacement parts are not available,I have this grill it worked fine we took it camping it stored easy in camper only problem is the drip pan/flame deflector rusted out real fast without it is is basically un-usable the burner is about rusted out and when I contacted the manufacturer and they say no parts are available for it I cleaned it each use and it still rusted out inferior metal on driop pan and burner
5,George Foreman Electric Grill,I have had this grill about a month and used it several times thus far. Easy to assemble. Grills up steaks and other meats nicely. Easy to take the grill unit off the stand and clean.The stand and unit as a whole could be about six inches higher. There should be a hook to hang the grill cover from as the unit currently requires you to find a good spot to set the cover when flipping the steak or checking the status of cooking.Overall very satisfied for the reasonable price charged. Would be willing to pay more for the added features mentioned.
3,Indoor/Outdoor george foreman grill,"Not as big as I expected. Advertisement(s) should show/list that there are different sizes are available. Not sturdy, so keep inquisitive children at bay. Good for family size of 2-4."
4,Great grill!,"Again, George Foreman products are a best buy! This is a great grill, extremely easy to ensemble and to use. I haven't missed any bar-b-q weekends since I bought it. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is that it was a little smaller than expected."
5,Recommended,Packaged correctly and safe. Used it first day it arrived indoors and it works great! Healthy cooking at it's finest and easy to clean. Grease drain makes it easier to clean since you can rinse it off and drain the water that falls down the grease drain. Highly recommend this high quality/cost effective product.
3,George Foreman grill,It is a fry pan - not a barbeque. The food tastes like a pan fry and has not the best flavor from the meat. It is ok for what I wanted it for...which was something to cook on for my marina where I have my boat. No barbeques are allowed on the docks. This works.
1,"Bad, rude selller",I ordered this and never even got a response from the seller. When I finally got a response because Amazon got involved the seller sent me a rather rude email.
2,useless,"There is no way to fix it around your arms or legs. The only way you can make use of it is using it like a blanket, but its size is way too small.totally useless, not recommend.Material is good though. It feels cozy comfortable."
2,Not for wing paddle,"Trying to use the Yak grips on a wing paddle [Epic midwing] was a fiasco. They slip and slide, because the paddle shaft stays wet, I guess. The increased leverage for torqueing while paddling leads to a shift in the angle of the paddle faces unexpectedly. I would not recommend their use for this type of paddle."
4,These are great however...,I tried many gloves however I could not find ones I liked or were comfortable. These grips have been great to use. Very comfortable. The one thing I can't understand is how someone could design these to be attached to the paddle by moistening them with water to help them slide on. That may work for bicycle grips and such but REALLY... do they not think that quite possibly the paddle may just happen to get wet? It is kayaking after all! They should design them to grip when wet. What were they thinking? That is the biggest problem with these is they will slip and move around unless you are super careful and don't get them wet.
3,"Does its job, but inside material tears easilty","Pretty much as the title says. They were tight putting them on, which is probably ok. Anything underneath where they might rub, the liner material tears and when attempting to adjust them if they move the torn liner material can bunch up creating little uncomfortable mounds underneath. Would pay a little more for a more durable product."
4,Classic New Age,I got this basically for Oxygene Part 2 since it was used in the movie Gallipoli; but the rest is recognizable if you like the New Age genre.
4,"Definitely for M. R, James Fans","This book is more a companion book to the ghost stories. Some of writing you can also get in A PLEASING TERROR, the Ash Tree Press hefty book collecting M. R. James fiction and non-fection writings on the supernatural, but that doesn't have the illustrations you'll find here. There are reproductions of woodcuts and engravings of older supernatural works, illustrations of M.R. James and his works (including some of the illustrations for THE FIVE JARS), and photographs.Personally, I enjoyed the way Dr. James verbally ripped apart the claim that a certain painting of the Annunciation was the work of a secret Satanist (yes, a picture of the painting is included). There's even a tribute by Christopher Lee. I found this book added to my enjoyment of M. R. James' work. I hope it will do the same for you."
3,"Great, stylish, and comfortable, but...","I really like these shoes, but the upper leather portion at the bend of your toes is so thin, it looks cheap. It tends to crinkly a bit like the skin on a hardboiled egg. I had to really investigate to see if it was in fact leather and not some cheap vinyl imitation.I still wear them weekly, but at the price, i would have expected them to not look so old so fast."
2,Hmmmmm...,"Not quite the worst of the acoustic post-punk set, but not too far from the bottom either. Two stars because the man can sing. Kind of a Lionel Richie for pierced and sulking mid-teen/early twenty-something set... A pomo Byronic anti-Byron for all the cut lil Christian scenesters- something to validate... well, whatever. His songs are drenched in bathos- trite sentimentality is the rule of the day. The kind of lyrics a fifth grader would be ashamed to scrawl in the margins of his english notebook. I haven't heard his other albums or his 'band' material- so I can't quite comment on whether or not they're any good. But if this is any indication... An ex-girlfriend scooped this pabulum into a get-well package; since then, I haven't looked at her the same."
1,If Oreson Scott Card was dead...,"... he'd be rolling in his grave. Ender's Game is one of the best books I've ever read and when Chris Carabba refers to it in one of his songs, it really irritates me. This is not ""true emotion."" It is someone whining and crying about love gone wrong, something that gets old very quickly. Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel (bless his soul) make REAL honest acoustic music. Instead of ""I miss your bed, I never sleep"" it's ""what a beautiful face I have found in this place that is circling all 'round the sun."" Notice the difference between a man missing his old girlfriend's bed and a man recognising the beauty of a face he may never see again. You decide which one is wiser. You decide who is the real poet.Feel free to vote this review not helpful. I am only trying to tell you the truth."
1,can anyone say ...,"if you are one man, do you really need a ""band name""? apparently this guy thinks so and hopes to cover up how unartistic and generic he is. he should try doing covers of ... trick songs, that way his lyrics would not be completely horrible. beware of this trendy ..."
4,"Beautiful sound, somewhat repetitive.","First of all, if you love the gorgeous sound of an acoustic guitar with a single voice, you probably should get this album. This entire album is Chris and a guitar. That's it. I think it's actually average to good over the course of the songs; the sound IS repetitive, but that is not necessarily bad. Chris has a good voice and the guitar is well mixed so I don't mind hearing the same 'type' of tune over and over. ""Screaming Infidelities"" is a great track and there are numerous others that have interesting twists and turns in the chord progressions so that we don't have to sit and listen to G-C-D chords all day long. This is a disc to take in bits and pieces really. I rarely sit and listen thru the entire album in one sitting. But I appreciate the indie quality that this release has and I feel that Chris is a good songwriter for the most part. Most of the songs are rather short (3-4 minutes) so things change quickly and that is nice.Recommended."
1,Stop the f*&$ing stereo right now!,"God in heaven, have mercy on me. My roommate owns this CD, and I loathe it with a passion unholy. From the repetitive, frantic strumming of the same two chords to the whiny, affected lyrics, I...I just can't take it any more. Every time my roommate plays it, I have to leave the room. It's just that awful. It's not that I dislike sad/emotional music, or accoustic guitar...I love both. When they are performed by someone with talent, that is. I simply can't stand the manipulative, false pain that oozes from every pore of this album.To anyone out there considering purchasing this CD, please hear me out- no matter who you broke up with, how lonely you are, or how awful you believe your life is, the pain you are feeling cannot compare to the agony that this album will inflict on anyone in the vicinity when you put it in your stereo and press play."
1,0 stars,"Chris Carabba is not a bad singer, at least in the sense that he hits all the notes. His voice, however, is the equivalence of fingernails on a chalkboard. It seriously is that cringe-inducing, and I can't stand to listen to it.Even if his voice doesn't have that effect on you, there isn't really much left here to enjoy. The instrumental work is incredibly simplistic and non-memorable, the lyrics are vague and whiny(along with his voice, see above), and the melodies are bland.I admittedly don't like the emo genre, but just about anything in it is better than this. I never thought I'd reccomend Thursday, Taking Back Sunday, or Saves The Day, but if you're into the genre listen to them, at least it's bearable. Maybe even venture beyond that into indie like Death Cab For Cutie or Pedro the Lion. Heck, some metal like Iron Maiden or Opeth would be nice too. As long as it isn't Dashboard Confessional, there is improvement."
4,Biting and Honest,"If you're between the ages of 14 and 18, you've probably heard (and memorized) each of these songs already. Chris Carrabba takes folk and pop and ""emo"", throws them in a blender, and creates a beautiful debut. If you are a.) searching for wistful music to listen to on a lonely car ride home, b.) pining for the girl you just lost, c.) a fan of Further Seems Forever (Chris' previous association, check out their debut 'The Moon Is Down'), or d.) just interested in hearing every teenager's favorite singer-songwriter, then pick this up. I recommend it above later releases, though ""The Places..."" is a fine album with high replayability. My favorite track is ""A Plain Morning"", for its sincerity and utter beauty."
3,pretty good cd,"i thought this was a pretty good cd. some songs kind of sounded the same, but it's still a good listen if you're in an emo kinda mood."
3,Emo to the max,"Even though many see Chris Carraba as a talented musician, with which i agree, this cd is just too emo for most. He cries and whines through 11 tracks and no matter how catchy the lyrics or guitar parts, it's just plain depressing. If thats what you're looking for (plus some decent acoustic guitar and vocals) then this is the cd for you. However, I, for one, enjoy music that brings out other emotions than sadness and melancholy."
4,"good, but it might not be the cd for you","This cd when looked at as a whole is a very good cd. However, don't expect to pick it up and hear spectacular vocals or guitar or harminozation. You find that. If you haven't heard this music before you might have to give the cd a couple of listens before you start singing praises about it. I know that i had to. When you look at each part of this cd individually it isn't much. It's nothing compared to some of the other music out there. But when you look at this cd with all the parts combined and focus on the overall emotion of the songs, you will most likely change your mind about it. This is a great cd. Don't get me wrong, it is easy listening and it is not the cd you want to pick up when your in the mood to dance or scream or mosh, but never the less, if you just want something to listen to while doing work or relexing, this is the cd."
2,Whiny and repititive...,"I used to like Dashboard a lot, but I don't know...it was just a phase I guess. Although I always preferred the pre-Things to post-Things Dashboard, I don't like any of it now. At first,you will fall for it: the songwriting, the backup singers...but then you wont like it anymore. The later songs aren't as good, and with only 2-4 songs I REALLY like, I just don't recommend it. Go download some of the songs. I don't hate Dashboard: Chris is a good songwriter and singer, but I don't really like this album."
4,This is NOT EMO...It's acoustic rock people...,And the first 4 songs are FANTASTIC but after that they really drop the ball until track 8 (Again I Go Unnoticed)....those are basically the 5 best songs...there's a few decent ones in between but 1-4 and 8 are 5 star.
2,Not a good fit,Disappointed. After two days the appearance of this cap was gone. It doesn't fit or give you that cowboys look.
4,Gift for Nephew,"This was a Christmas gift for my nephew, and he just loved it. Great quality and had the NFL logo on it. Wasn't sure if it was going to be real, nephew is very picky with his sports memorbilia."
4,The Founding Fathers Faiths,"Right Wing Religious conservatives have tried to put George Washington on a pedestal as a founder of a Christian Nation. David L. Holmes doesn't take sides but confronts these myths regarding the founding fathers. I would also suggest Deism In American Thought, by Woodbridge Riley and of course Thomas Paines, The Age of Reason, our founding fathers had good reasons for insuring the separation of religion and state. I would offer as an example the laws that existed regarding Quakers that existed in some of the colonies as an example of what they were trying to prevent in their concept of a new nation. What people will do ""In the name of God"" is still a modern day concern. Secularism has become almost a religion in modern times, without including allowances for some ethics and spirituality. Man is not a noble savage!"
3,"Best to read the Founders' statements directly, without filtering","While a well done summary, this is still another summary book. It is better simply to look up America's Founders' own statements on the Internet and draw your own conclusions. The Founders were very good and prolific writers, speech makers, and even publishers. It's not that hard or time consuming to search the Web. In this regard, please see my Amazon review of THE FAITHS OF OUR FATHERS, by Alf J. Mapp, Jr."
1,Horrible,We bought this book and were thoroughly disappointed in what we read. How does this author know what these Founding Fathers of our country believed in their heart of hearts?Only God knows that.
4,Eye Opening,"This book was very well written. The author made the case that some of the founding fathers were not necessarily Christian, but Deists. His conclusions stem from letters written to, and from, various people that had contact with them (friends, family, clergymen, etc.) - which makes sense; however, some of the author's assumptions (i.e. the language the ""fathers"" used in writing and speeches) about how they referred to God (the Almighty, Nature's God, etc.) is not necessarily the best way to prove that the founding fathers were not Christian.It certainly shed some light, although not definitive, on the faiths of our founding fathers and their families."
2,Cheap & unstable,I was so annoyed w/ the garden hose tangling & decided to buy a reel. This one is not very stable & made of cheap material. It took such pain to round up the hose & the reel kept moving and falling down... not sturdy at all. I wanted to return but my husband threw away the package. We happened to receive on the trash day. Now I'm stuck w/ it :-(.
2,As advertized but cheap design...,"The product is as advertized but the design is cheap... Cheap plastic that twists when you wind, flimsy assembly and fragile. Also the leader hose they give you is of bad quality and it collapses if there is any torque at all on it, which there will be when you move the cart... It also has cheap fittings that can't take the wrench you need to tighten them. I replaced the leader hose with a good quality hose with good fittings, lubricated the O-rings that were barely water tight and for now it works as advertized. Not sure when it will start to leak..."
1,Stay away from this model.,"This model is a piece of junk. Where the hose comes out of the reel, it pinches the hose so bad it shuts off the water. Suncast makes a much better model that holds 225 ft. of hose and is $10 cheaper at Lowes than this junker."
1,Broke in Less Than a Season,"The barrel broke away from the windup wheel during less than a season of normal use, and now that it's broken you can see how the whole thing was held together with nothing more than cheap plastic tabs. It was easy enough to wind and unwind, I'll give it that, though it leaked like a sieve. I'm avoiding anything manufactured by Suncast in the future."
4,saw them live a long time ago,"I saw them live at Steb's many years ago. They had a good vocalist, and a fairly good band. I still enjoy listening to the album. Not suprisingly though, haven't heard from them since."
1,Cheap Product,I purchased this product the other day and when I received it in the mail the product looked nothing like the picture shown above. What I got was a cheap plain black stocking hat with a raiders image on it. Not a reebok one as shown in picture. I would recommend not purchasing this product total waste of $10. False info!!!
1,No good,"Is not the same product, I payed for this one and I recivied another different, however id cheap but you have to change the picture"
3,cute but very small,This is a sweet hoodie but the sizing is more for a child than adult. The large looks like a child's size lg. My daughter normally wears a medium and this large looks like an extra-small on her.
2,Silly Kids Game,"The game is a flash to past. It is very small on cd, smaller than some of the other game demos they include on cd. The graphics remind me of Wallace and Gromit and are fine. The gameplay consists of highly structed pratfalls with a laugh track. It is fun for about 30 minutes. I think maybe small children might enjoy for many short periods though."
5,great!,Works well! It does not rust and the basket size is larger than many colanders that I have seen. The expanding mechanism works well. I bought one for my Mom last year and now she is getting one for someone for Christmas this year.
5,Nice to drain things right over the sink no matter the size of the sink,"What I would like to have known bfore I purchased this product is that the ""holes"" are bigger than I thought but I can still use it. I also would like to have known the same product under a different manufacturer's name was sold in a local store for $14.99. It claimed to be stainless steel also but with all things made in China, it's hard to know when you are getting what you think you are getting. But if one has lots of things to clean and drain over a sink (as I do), this is a great product especially with the expanding reach of it. It fits any of my 3 kitchen sinks."
4,Great functionality but.....,"I love the capacity, the allover mesh for thorough draining and handles for off-sink useage; however, there is a lip circling the interior under the handles that annoyingly captures food when the strainer is flipped over to be washed.So for large items this strainer is fine, but use a regular one for smaller or ""flakeable"" items that could get caught under the lip like cooked broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, etc"
2,Holes Too Small,"I've used this colander for close to two years, and am sort of surprised by the positive comments on Amazon here. I regularly use it for noodles, stuffed pastas, and more. I'm now looking for a new colander because the holes to drain the water are just too small, so bits of food tend to get stuck in them, and then it's almost impossible to clean. Sure it works, but the maintenance is too much for me."
5,useful item,My new colander has come in handy more often than I expected. It's light and a perfect size. Good deal!
3,It's o.k.,"Works fine and is quite durable. My only regret is that I should have bought a digital instead. The flags don't drop on the minute, instead they just kind of hang up for anywhere from 15-45 seconds after the time is up."
1,Did not work.,"To begin with, this clock did not work when I received it. This is a huge complaint, but the only one. Return was easy, and once you get one that works, this is a great clock. Action is crisp, and it is simple to use."
2,Not Working.,The timer stopped working after using it a couple of times.The price was within range forsimilar products and should have been more durable.
3,Standard analog clock,"Classic clock, durable and low battery usage (comes with a battery). Worthwhile investment if you are serious about playing and learning chess for a few years."
5,Great chess clock,"I purchased this clock for my son, and he absolutely loves it. It's very sturdy and we haven't had any problems with it. A great value for the money!"
1,Bad really bad!,"I'm very disappointed, I can't feel the smell, well...only if I get close one inch of the bottle!! Smell just a bit in the morning when open the car and 5 second later the smell go away!! bad product try something else I don't recommend this product."
4,"Sweet group, good performance...Not a great recording","Black Uhuru get pretty revved up here. I suspect the sound on this video is representative of the sound at the show: Murky, not clear treble. But the bass is good at least. Once you turn it up, you can re-create the sound convincingly enough. The songs here are from the very beginning of Uhuru's ascent to the top of militant reggae. Sly & Robbie don't sound quite as modern and polished as they do on ""Red"". As always, there is too much focus on the lead singer, but Puma Jones' dancing is captivating."
5,I love it !!! Awesome music!,mexican radio from charlie early is the best song in the album. it rocks!
1,The Butterfly Garden,"I have read many books of the amish and this is the first one I have every read with the ugly words you have used in it,and sexual life you talk about between this couple,I will not read another book of yours.I am a christian and have enjoyed reading books with stories of the life the amish live, even thou I do not agree with what they believe in, They are true to their faith and they are a close net family, But the language you used in your book was all uncalled for. Other wise the book The Butterfly Garden would of been great."
3,Good Story,"I enjoyed the story line. It began well, I liked the characters and I also enjoyed the ending. The book was just too demonstrative for my liking. This was my 1st book by Annette Blair. I'm not sure if I will read another one or not. I have read all of Beverly Lewis Books on the amish and I have read alot of Wanda Brunstetter's amish books and several other amish books. This was the 1st one that I was unhappy with."
1,Butterfly Garden,"I had a really hard time finishing this book. I was excited about the story line and couldn't wait to get started reading.The beginning was okay, but I kept thinking it would get better. It did not. It only got worse.Like the other reviewers, I too have read a lot of Amish books and found that this book wasn't really about being Amish at all. Not accurately anyway.The story had moments where I thought ""are you kidding me?"" It was pretty predictable. I finally finished it and still am not sure why I forced myself to read the last 100 pages.The sex scenes were just too over the top..lots of details here..but not much anywhere else."
1,Unbelievable Mishmash,"I loved the premise of this book, read the reviews, and was sorely disappointed. Making it an Amish romance was a little weird, especially when the ""Amish"" didn't act Amish at all. I've live with Amish neighbors for most of my life & very little in this book reminded me of their simple & dignified lifestyle. The story jogged all over the place, never staying in one direction long enough to follow through. There were endless unbelievable occurrences--one or two could be reasonable, but when the number that occur in this book show up, it makes you think the author was straining for focus. The love scenes seemed lifted from a typical bodice-ripper romance, and everybody was just too nice in the final scene. Ick."
5,A great long read,"I loved THIS story ,it was one of the best reads I have ever did.. I have never read anything by Annette Blair. But this was so good I just bought ""Jacob's Returns"" I am so happy .I love the fact it was long and went into so much detail .Sara was a great midwife and the love she had for so many ,the way she turned a man who could not LOVE into a person all loved.I wish I was Amish READING this."
1,Butterfly Garden,"I was very disappointed in this book Butterfly Garden by Annette Blair. I read Amish Fiction because they are clean. If I wanted to read trashy books, I would have purchaed them. Keep bedroom scenes out of these stories."
3,"Close, but no cigar","This is a review of just the one song, In Your Eyes. I have not listened to the other songs. Although Mr. Gaines' version is very good, the only emotion it consistently evokes in me is the strong desire to listen to Peter Gabriel's original version."
4,Rocks!,"I love this album. I listen to it regularly. It gets only 4 stars, because it has 2 versions of ""In your eyes"". The acoustic live version rocks, but the studio one is unneccesary(actually, the live version is on ""Galore"" too). Also ""Hero in me"" is borrowed from his first classic album and cleaned up nice and pretty, but even Jeffrey Gaines should not mess with classic Jeffrey Gaines. The sound quality of ""Always be"" is amongst the cleanest and best sounding albums I have ever heard. The title song starts the album with a powerful crisp acoustic sound... Wow! I look forward to his next album, because there will be incredible soul-felt gems to enjoy."
5,Gaither Music CD,"I received this item very quickly after ordering. It was a gift, which I'm sure was enjoyed by the recipient as she loves all of the Gaither gospel music. Thank you."
5,gift,"As a gift, this cd was much appreciated. The music was as expected. Shipping was on time and promised. The CD provided hours of enjoyable listening."
3,Does what I need it to do.,"I used this door opener in a school project, and it worked for my purposes. However, through using it, I discovered that there is a flaw in the design spec list. One of the specs is that if someone obstructs the door's path, it will stop. That feature doesn't work. The lock works too. I powered it with 12V separately. I've only tested it with a cabinet-sized door."
1,Nightmare,I purchased this item for a hidden door project. The project is now almost a month behind and still waiting. I followed the setup procedures to the letter. The remote opener would not work. I called tech support and was treated like I was stupid. They told me to mail in my remote and they would send me a new one. I received a second remote that I ordered myself before the replacement remote ever arrived. I again contacted tech support and was treated again like I was stupid.
4,DM-100 Door Operator,"Easy to install, easy to set up, does what it's designed for. I would recommend it for anyone needing a low cost door operator"
2,Tough to use after a while,"It was great at first, but after a couple months it seems to have dulled quickly and it just wants to peel the labels off with the lids. It takes a lot of strength to use it too."
4,compact and durable,"Compact and durable, sleek and shiney. If you are use to larger manuel openers, this one may be a bit clumsy at first. Takes up little space in my over-crowded kitchen gadget drawer."
4,GREAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DETAILED WALKTHROUGH,"DONT GET CAUGHT!!!, this book adds up to about $30 if you live in Australia and count the conversion rate. Never the less, this book is a very detailed walkthrough, in story-format. It has a few extra's like all the enemy and boss bio's, but it doesn't include magic an armour etc."
2,dont waste your money,"i can tell you right now that unless you absolutely need maps for this game (not likely - it isnt much of a maze game), you're wasting your money with this guide. there's a much more complete PRINTABLE illustrated SoM guide available at mana.gamespage.com which even includes all the secrets / glitches."
5,This is the best CD ever,"This is one of the best CD's ever, these are the best, and to get a taste of almost all their songs, look for their Exitos."
5,A spanish who was looking for this CD two years,"This is an excellent CD, one of the best i have, i really like it and i think it has really good songs. Hombres G are cool"
3,Good story about an invasion of our galaxy,"Good story, whoever wrote it. I have always thought a good ""Star Trek"" story would be about aliens from the Andromeda Galaxy. I must say one thing though. If I were to be executed for trying to escape, I certainly wouldn't want to end up crushed into a pile of white powder in the palm of someone's hand. I've always been disturbed by that scene, and worse than that, they had to make it a female yeoman! Killing another man would have been fine, but the Kelvans were rather cruel doing that. Also, the end of the episode indicates that Rojan, the leader of the Kelvans, will go unpunished for killing Yeoman Thompson like that. Kirk says that they will welcome them as friends to join the Federation of Planets. I'm sorry, but would you want to have a race like this as a part of your society? I certainly would not!Good story, but has too many problems."
5,Great music and a whole lot of spirit!,"I've known Rick Fannin and Tom Scheidt for 10 years and have seen Fannigan's Isle play countless times. What strikes you about their live performances is that they're not only extremely accomplished musicians, but they have a rapport with the audience that is truly unique and wonderful. They win over everyone with their spirit, talent, and humor, and this is perfectly captured on Orange and Green."
1,"Don't call us, Betty..........","Having seen this woman perform on stage in London, I quickly came to the conclusion that she has the presence of a postage stamp. I don't know what inspired me to buy this album, but it is quickly consigned to the only listened to once category. Certainly NOT my cup of tea, and as the saying goes....""don't call us, love......"""
5,great rose fertilizer,"I have alot of gardening experience except with roses. When I moved into my husbands family home I inherited his grandmother's 70 year old rose bush which was in need of quite a bit of tlc. I was afraid of damaging the bush so I used Jobe's spikes for roses.Low and behold, after some select pruning and the food spikes, grandma's rose is once again growing and blooming.Thanks Jobe's!!!"
4,Good product.,This is the first time I have used these and actually I bought them for my patio roses because the Bayer 3 in 1 that I use on all my other roses said not to use it on conainer roses. I must say I think it has worked well and I would use them again. Another plus is that they are easy to use.
2,Bad first impression...,"I just got this CD last night, so it might grow on me, but as of my third listen, this album is a horrible bore. I love Human Mesh Dance, Omicron, P909, and SETI, but this isn't doing it for me. My friends totally talked this album up, and I was expecting something a lot more beat-driven and funky. Some of the drum loops are kinda interesting, but the rest of it sounds like pointless noodling. Not much to say about it."
4,Band from spain RAPCORE,All I have to say is if u like stuff like kid rock and limp bizkit and rage against the machine and u speak spanish this band will blow your mind these guys are good.
5,Anne Murray in Jamaica-Excellent Special,"This DVD contains a special by Anne Murray filmed in Jamaica. It is from around 1978. This is excellent nostolgia, and a must for any Anne Murray fan. Anne sings a few of her own hits, plus her take on music at the time. Guest stars are Valerie Harper and Ruth Buzzi. Let's hope more of Anne's specials are released on DVD. I highly recommend."
1,Terrible recording quality,"This appears to have been taken from an old video tape of the concert, and the picture quality is terrible, while the sound quality is pretty poor as well.It is difficult to believe Anne Murray would have agreed to the release of this, as there must be other material from the same era which is of better quality.The content may be enjoyable, but in every other respect this is now the worst DVD I own."
2,I should have spent a bit more to get a better one!,Not too happy with this small pizza stone--before I ordered this one for a long time I had a set of flat bricks in my oven that were made for pizza baking and bread baking. I couldnt find these bricks again--I had them for a long time and they were cracked and hard to clean by now BUT they were so much better than this small round stone! My bricks made my pizza crust so crispy--and this stone is a poor substitute for this! My bricks were square and made a beautiful large square on my shelf--if anyone knows what I am writing about--PLS email me and let me know where these set of bricks can be found and their name! I am not happy with this pizza set-the rack is of no use--the pizza cutter is a cheap one--they really should put the money into making a better product than giving extras!
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!,"I bought my toaster 3 months ago, I was looking for something sleek,looks good and works great. The true test came Thanksgiving, I needed to cook my greenbean casserole but my ovens were being used; so I put it in the toaster and it turned out great! My tenagers use it for frozen foods and my husband uses it for bagels, the bagels come out toasted on top; but not rock hard on the bottom. Baked potatoes are a snap and cleaning the oven is easy."
1,wire tray,"A 12"" wire tray was sent with this Toastmaster Toaster Oven. The inside of the oven measurers 11 1/2"" and there is no way it can fit. Origionally,I was going to return the Toaster Oven to Amazon but decided to contact Saltan and attempt to have them ship the proper tray. This has taken me several weeks as Salton is not fast and I had to mail them a copy of my shipper. I assume I may, and I say ""may"" receive the tray by next month, if I'm lucky."
4,Decent for cooking...,"I've bought two of these over the past few years. One for a Christmas present for parents, and one for light broiling/cooking at the office. Both are still running perfectly.While I will agree the interface isn't the greatest and the lack of a temperature setting is less helpful, I haven't found that I've needed one.There's enough food group settings and you can dial in the cooking time, to where food comes out right.It makes great toasted-cheese sandwiches, pizza, sausages, and is flexible enough to broil a steak or cornish hen at the office. With 6 coworkers in a small office, many of them frequently use the toaster in preparing their meals tho we have a large 1000 watt microwave as well.I think it's a great handy tool to have and helps prepare healthier meals then throwing some pre-packaged food in a microwave."
3,I expected more...,"I bought this particular toaster oven, sight unseen, based upon ratings in Consumer Reports. My old toaster oven was 25 years old and looked at least that age. The Toastmaster TLWTOB6 is larger and much better looking than my old toaster oven. I like the instant heat feature but the lack of a temperature control I find frustrating. I would much rather set the time and temperature myself; the TLWTOB6 doesn't give me that option, so I have to just guess and hope. I was hoping that this toaster oven would take over many of the functions of my regular oven but I think that all I'm going to use it for is to make toast and to look good on my counter top."
1,Save Your Money,Bought this unit and am sending it back pronto. It's a piece of C##P! Tried making 4 slices of toast. The toast came out two tones of brown on one side and striped (from the wire rack)on the bottom. The sound when entering your selection or when done is loud and horrendous. Cannot simply put something in it to keep it warm while preparing other food. No temp control is a real pain. Don't waste your money on this!!!!
2,Great while it lasted,"This novel product heats up fast and cooks many foods well, so it was versatile. The problem was that after two months, the halogen element on the top of the oven just stopped working. I have read many reviews on this product now and see that several others have had the same problem. This is pretty disappointing from a major brand like Toastmaster.It is quite bulky too, so stay away from this if you are a) interested in a product that is well made & durable, or b) short on counter top space. Also, keep any plastic far away from the oven as it gives off a LOT of heat."
2,Not impressed,"I recently recived this toaster oven as christmas gift. I like the overall look of the oven and how fast it heats up. However there are things about it that I don't like, ie. ( No control over the temperature and that annoying beeping ) plus there is no safety shut off for when you open the door. I've been using toaster ovens for years and this one definately doesn't impress me at all."
3,Cooks good for a while,My wife loved this oven. She used it to cook chicken and other meats. They came out great. Toast came out okay. After about 9 months the light blew out in the oven. With out the light you can't cook. We got another for free from the MFG. Now about 9 months again something is wrong. I think the lights are going again. Cooked great when it worked. Wouldn't buy it again. Doesn't last.
2,Not worth the money,"Like other reviewers have said, the loud beeping is very annoying. Since the beginning, I thought that it toasted bread poorly no matter what setting it was on (one side toasted, one side just slightly striped). It did work nicely for my kids' chicken nuggets though. Unfortunately, the top lighting element burned out already and we can't be very much over the one year warranty period, if at all. The c.s. rep said that she hasn't gotten any calls about this issue, but according to the other reviews I find that hard to believe. I expected A LOT more out of this thing since it is so expensive. I wouldn't recommend buying this, but save your receipt if you do - you'll need it!"
4,Fast toaster and oven,"We saw the Lightwave at a friend's home and just had to have it. It takes some getting used to, since you don't control temperature and the settings are different from a conventional toaster oven. The toast function is very fast, and produces good results. We are still experimenting with the baking and other functions. It does get very hot on the outside surfaces when operating, and needs to be a number of inches from wall and other surfaces when it is on. It also takes up a good bit of counter space, but space used is comparable to the large, SLOW toaster oven I previously had.All in all, a good buy."
1,Annoying indeed,"I agree with all of the comments about no temp control and annoying beeper. Mine has an error so that it stops cooking after 1-2 minutes and sometimes takes 4-5 restarts to get it to cook. It beeps everytime it does this. Also, there is an ""error"" beep that goes off for about 30 seconds which will wake the dead. I do not recommend this to anyone who wants to make toast without waking the neighborhood!"
3,Nice while it lasted,"This toaster served me very well for about 3 years. It had drawbacks (no actual temperature setting (F or C) but generic terms like ""frozen food"", very prone to stain interior and exterior, and it was really loud) but it worked very well for about 3 years. Then the heating element burned out with a ""fizzle"" and the rest followed shortly afterwards. I've made my peace with it being dead and am looking at a high-end Krups replacement as IR toasters have faded in popularity (probably due to heating elements not lasting as long)."
5,"Excellent, inspiring, poignant","Eubank writes with prose and clarity. This book is an open, inspirational rags to riches tale. It provides the reader with a lot of ground advice coupled with a spice of humour. After reading this book you actually feel like you are Chris's close friend. It amazes me why he is not taken more seriously considering his achievements inside and outside of the ring."
5,awesome tea pot!!,"I love the little pot, the quality of the brew is very good. I would recommend getting the warmer with it though, if you're a slow tea drinking like I am."
3,Nice pot - forget the cups,"I really like the cast iron pot. The color is a nice green, not showy, and the strainer inside makes it easy to use loose tea. It's not a large pot, makes what most people would consider a couple of cups of tea, which is good for a single tea drinker like me. The cups hold maybe four sips, so I don't use them."
3,"Good product, if all parts were included!","We received this as a wedding gift and it was missing the handle and the second cup! I love cast iron and it was very pretty, but we had to send it back because of the missing parts. Thankfully, Amazon always comes through and gave us a refund on the item and we bought a different cast iron teapot that was a bit bigger (42 oz)."
5,"Beautiful, practical, and fun","I love how it includes everything you need to make tea. The design is beautiful, the color is excellent, and it came well packaged and protected. The tea cups do get hot, but it's Japanese tradition (I think?). Anyway, the set looks beautiful and is very practical, but I wish you had the option of ordering more cups. I'm scared to buy one and it not match."
5,Lizzy didn't take an ax!,Lizzy was a woman convicted of a crime she sid not do. If you see this you will see things another way.
3,I LOVE HUMMINGBIRDS,"I LOVE HUMMINGBIRDS AND ENJOY DIFFERENT TYPES AROUND MY HOME. THE ANNAS ARE VERY FAMILIAR TO SONOMA COUNTY, NO. CALIFORNIA. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THEIR RETURN EACH YEAR. WATCHING THIS FILM WAS A GLORIOUS LOT OF INFORMATION ON OTHER BIRDS IN THE SPECIES. BEAUTIFUL AND AMAZING INFORMATION ON ONE OF NATURE'S MOST BEAUTIFUL CREATURES OF WINGS."
5,Nature: Hummingbirds,"I first saw this documentary on TV and kept it on my DVR. I watched the DVD, and it is the same, so I was able to erase the DVR recording. I now can watch this DVD any time I wish. I enjoy hummngbirds and feed them each year they come back, and I will enjoy this DVD often.Nature: Hummingbirds"
3,"okay, it's like this...","Clearly, the woman has memorized Portishead and aspired to *be* Bjork. That's cool -- I like them too. When I'm in the mood for Portishead, I'll reach for Portishead and bypass the impression-of-Portishead. The same applies to Bjork.That said, I like the songs that did *not* remind me of anyone else. I'd count about 4 or 5 songs that suggested real talent and a unique style. Are you reading, Emiliana? Be yourself."
3,It's okay... it's not all that GREAT.,"I overheard a song from the movie ""Pumpkin"" that Emilana covers called ""If you go away""... AMAZING. Then I heard a song that she did with Paul Oakenfold which was flawless! So I decided to get online and investigate. I read the ""rave"" reviews here and was convinced to buy it. I don't regret it... but I was kinda dissapointed. It's not as great as these other reviewers make it out to be. I found the music is beautiful but unremarkable, and I found the lyrics to be alittle weak. I can hear some similiarity in Emilana and Bjork but if you were to put the both of them to the test... Bjork wins, NO CONTEST. Do believe everything you read here. Listen to the album and judge for yourself."
3,Compelling limitations,"3 1/2Torrini's debut fits snugly with other female-fronted trip-hop acts from around the millennium. There are attempts to sound more organic and singer-songwriterish, but ultimately it is a (willingly accepted) facade even good production and her obvious vocal strength cannot completely transcend."
5,absolutamente deliciosa,"este album de emiliana torrini, es una joya, es su primer gran album en solitario y combina, con belleza y sencilles la electronica, el jazz y un pop muy suave y sofisticado.es cierto, suena algo simil a bjork, pero es muy diferente a ella, emiliana suena mas serena, y como lo afirme antes mas sofisticada.respecto a cada cancion, ninguna es simil a la otra, son diferentes, melodiosas y ese extraña pronunciacion de emiliana hace de oirla una experiencia relajante."
4,3.75 STARS ACTUALLY HOLY BJORK!,BOUGHT THIS ON A WHIM-NOT KNOWING THE TWO TOWERS CONNECTION. I MUST SAY THE BJORK ELEMENT IS PROMINENT. IN THE STYLE OF TRIPHOP BUT ALSO BRANCHES OUT ALITTLE MORE-WHICH MAKES FOR AN INTERESTING LISTEN. FOR FANS OF LAMB-HOOVERPHONIC- AND OFCOURSE BJORK- THERES EVEN A HINT OF BETH GIBBONS FROM PORTISHEAD! ITS ACTUALLY VERY GOOD-SOME ELEMENTS OF JAZZ-CLASSICAL AND POP. ONE OR TWO WEAK TRACKS- BUT WORTH YOUR MONEY. I LOVE FEMALE FRONTED DOWNTEMPO TRIPHOP BANDS AND SOLO ARTISTS BUT MUST SAY MANY OF THEM TEND TO SOUND ALIKE. SOME SONGS ARE WRITTEN BY ROLAND ORZABEL FROM TEARS FOR FEARS FAME(PRETTY GOOD) AND THE PRODUCTION HAS MORE LIFE INFUSED INTO IT THAN MOST TRIPHOPSTYLED PROJECTS. OVERALL A SOLID RECORD- THAT HINTS AT OTHER MORE KNOWN ARTISTS-BUT IS MAYBE MORE DIVERSE. ALL IN ALL A WORTHY BUY IN AN AGE WHERE MOST RECORDS TEND TO BE BELOW PAR. RECOMMENDED!!
2,(Not) Good,"Beautiful voice, and very skilled vocals; but what a pity that lyrics are just slightly above alternative teenage-pop, she could do better, i'll definitely go for her next CD, hoping it will be better in lyrics."
3,Needs More Chorus!,"I really liked about half the songs on here, but the other half were just plain boring.To Be Free- 4.5/5 really good, possibly the best on the cd.Wednesdays Child- 4/5 dark, but goodBaby Blue- 3.5/5 really loved the music, but I really hated the lyrics!Dead Things- 3/5 the only thing that made this song bearable was the brief climax smack in the middle. It needed at least another one. There just wasnt enough to keep it going.Unimployed in the Summertime- 2/5 boring, boringEasy- 4/5 really cool, very smooth.Fingertips- ? dont remember this oneTelepathy- 1/5 What is up with her voice? sounds like she aged about 40 years! This song isn't good anyway. Melodramatic.Tuna Fish- 3/5 Melodramatic.Summerbreeze- Boring, lyrics dullSea People- ? Dont remember this oneSo it really was okay, just all of the songs needed more chorus. Try Puracane out. Same style, just not boring at all."
4,Excellent. What A Surprise Find!,"I'm just going to say I'm thrilled with this purchase. Solid and beautiful all the way through. Why on Earth this didn't cause more stir when it came out, I don't know."
5,True Talent,"Well it seems people from Iceland can do no wrong... Emilliana Torrini is often compared to the other singer Bjork. Well if it's because Bjork has talent too the comparison can't be more trueThis CD is almost perfect, the songs are gentle and would make anybody smile but just listening to them...Can't go wrong with this one... This is real ""trip-pop"" :o)"
4,Trip Hop Baby,"This album is really a surprise. First i thought that Emiliana was a Portishead follower, but then u notice that there is something different going on. The song ""Baby Blue"" is very melodic in a mysterious way and the whole album fill your good music expectations."
1,Hopeless,An internet download with links that don't work. Don't waste your money - you can find most of the same (identical) information on the Travel Channel website.
1,A dud!,This product isn't parmesan cheese. It lacks the distinctive seal of this cheese which must conform to a severe set of rules. A European court has prohibited the use of the term parmesan for all cheeses not produced according to the parmesan consortium specifications.
1,Doesn't work for us...,"We followed the directions implicity (back 1/4 turn, forward to cut, back 1/4 turn to release), and it just spun the can around with not even a cut on the can, but did leave grip marks on the inside rim...back to the store!"
3,Good first try for a BTB Christmas book.,"Bob, Wendy, and the entire crew are present for this Christmas adventure. The story is complete with snow, Christmas tree, gifts, and good will. They even use the increasingly politically incorrect term ""Christmas"" (I'm all for Christmas, Jesus is the reason for the season). A quick and fun read with a minimal amount of words, high quality photographs, and made of attractive and sturdy materials."
5,I feel music,"Im so old school, my elementry school desk sat two of us. I LOVE MUSIC. The Dramatics were always singing to the heart."
4,ambient atmosphere,"This is a very interesting cd Its very spacy electronic and dialoge talking as well.It starts off with voices and then the journey begins. I never heard of this artist (Tetsu Inoue) I heard this music on a new age program on the internet. and it really got to me. there was something quite special about this music. The electronic sounds are very atmosphric and it makes you think about the planets in our solor system and other galaxy stars. I think that is what the cover of this cd is trying to tell the listener.What is out there ,Could it be a reality some day.Yes I do recomend this cd to all of the New age listeners. It is something to consider."
3,BILAL BLOWS UP,"A mixture of the funk and flow of d angelou, with a mix of a soft love sick ballard. I really enjoyed this single, and being one who really doesn't usuall spend the money bying singles i was pleasently surprized. i wait to hear some from this cat as interscope will release his cd soon!!! Philadelphia promises to produce some real interesting artist, if this is an indication...."
5,MODERN CLASSIC...,"SOUL SISTA... The first time I heard this song I was vacuuming the living room floor when all of a sudden I just stopped and said ""OOOhhhhh.. I am finally hearing real authentic black music from the soul. Finally a fresh breath of air."" I was mesmerized and in a trance from the sweet sound of his voice. Everything about the song and video had meaning unlike anything I had heard or seen in a long time. No frills simply pure music and a meaningful black and white video. The next thing I did was run to the record store grab the single. Every song and snippet touched my soul. It was like I was in a dream. All the songs had I true meaning from a person who you could tell was putting his entire soul into each song. I believe this song ranks up there with some of the great songs of the past in my opinion. This single is MUST HAVE for any R&B purist. Nothing else to say but ""PICK IT UP AND SEE FOR YOURSELF."""
4,If you like your DEEP HOUSE Behrouz does not dissapoint!!!!,"Behrouz flow on his cd is so DEEP and SMOOTH that its worth the purchase alone. I have never heard the man spin live but if this reflects his sets than I am truly missing out. His flow through the mix takes you were you want to go, with a DEEP bass line that never lets up. Yousef syle just doesnt do it for me. Now im not saying its a bad mix just not my style. More funk and bump. But that is what Renaissance is doing with the Frontier series, bringing two differnt styles to one 2disc comp for all to enjoy. If you like your music DEEP,DARK, and SMOOTH you will not be disapointed with Behourz. And if you like your funk than Yousef will do the job as well. Overall another top quality mix from Renaissance."
2,Use caution when ordering this product,The program could be very good if some of the bugs were fixed in it. If you plan on doing short productions then this program would be okay but if you are wanting do long extensive video capturing I would look for something else.
4,Angelic Perspective,"Having read ""Commune with the Angels"" almost two years ago, I am still amazed at the extent the wisdom and love shared within its pages continues to affect my life. The exercises are very simple, non-threatening, and easy to integrate into one's daily life. It taught me how to begin to remember who I am, who the angels are, and how we co-exist and co-create together. My life has been greatly enriched through experiencing this book. My unending gratitude and respect are given to Ms. Howard for her courage in sharing her life and experiences with us all."
3,communing....,I have read this book before !! A friend of mine borrowed it (?) & I never got it back.... It was helpful to me in the past and I felt that it was time for me to read it again !!Good book for meditation techniques & visualization. Something for everyone !!I recommend this book !!
2,False information,"Although this book is useful in teaching you some varied techniques on how to be open to your angels specifics such as Bible references were incorrect. Other information in regards to the angels I found to be very questionable because I could not locate another resource that agreed with her findings. So take the information with the ""grain of salt""."
5,How to find out the truth about a Business's health,"Are you the kind of investor that relies solely on an Annual Report to make your decisions? You better watch out. An Annual Report usually only provides a rosy picture which in the end is meant to highlight a CEO and his team's performance. The authors' underlying thesis is that neither the Profit & Loss Statement nor the Balance Sheet provide enough information to find out if a Business is healthy. In order to find out the truth, a Cash Flow analysis is a must, after all, Cash Flow is a Business's blood. The book provides examples on how to do it. The first chapters are easy to read, but the last ones require advanced Accounting knowledge."
1,Yawn...........,Not bad as much as just plain weak. Flanged guitars and reverb ala early Cure paired with weak female vocals singing lyrics that sound like they were written by a community college art student trying too hard to be profound. Track down an old Strange Boutique album or Slowdive CD instead if you like this formula.
5,Underappreciated greats!,"I have followed the development of Joe Marc's Brother for years. They are a truly unique and ultimately talented band - this albumn highlights their innovation and staightforward approach to solid song writing and presentation. Buy this albumn! And definitely see them if you are fortunate enough to have them travel to your town. Or better yet, if you are in Nashville - go see them on their home turf."
5,Super fun hot stuff,"I love this cd for many reasons, not the least of which is Joe's wonderful, gruffy, emotive voice. Great evocative lyrics and excellent driving/pound on the steering wheel songs, with delicate ballads interspersed. I love it!!"
2,not what i expected,I took this product it did clean out my system but there was no weight loss or did I feel my immune system was any better for it..
1,Ouch!,All this product did was give me a stomach ache & uncomfortable gas for 2 days. I had to stop taking it.I would like information on how to send this back for a full refund.Thanks.
1,Do not waste your money,"I purchased this product with the hopes of purifying my system, but the pills taste nasty and you have to pop like 6 a day. I did not lose any weight either."
1,Not A Miracle Worker,"I suffer from chronic constipation and I can tell you that this product is no miracle worker! On the third day of using the detox cleanser I finally had a BM BUT it was nothing to feel ""relieved"" about. Maybe this product would work for ""regular"" people but not for us ""chronic"" people.I honestly feel ripped off."
1,Should Have read the reviews first,"WOW!!!! where do I start?...I will start by saying- this product is full of what it claims to get rid of (I think a clear, and concise assumption can be derived from this analogy). I didn't pass any WASTE, nor did I loose anything from my WAIST. I swear, a prerequisite of working in GNC is being capable of saying ""Oh Yeah, this is one of our hottest selling items. I got a friend who tried it, and he had great results with it."" The only positive that I've gotten from this product is the ability not to trust idiots who will benefit from a sale, and read the reviews of people who have nothing to lose/gain, when critiquing a product."
3,grater,"I ordered this 6 sided grater because I thought it would be easy to use. However, it is not as easy as I expected."
1,monica in hondo,"This thing is absolute trash. If you want a really cool looking timer so you can ""look"" like you might use one, then this is for you as long as you just look but don't use. Or maybe could be used as a meditation timer for monks used to one or two quiet gongs. The ""long ringing"" bell rings 5 to 10 seconds and you'll only hear it if your standing there admireing how charming and streamline it is. Shame on you Oneida, I never knew you to put your good name on junk like this."
3,description didn't match product,"2 movies bundled onto 1 cd. Didn't realize it and returned it twice only to discover it was right the first time. CD was in great shape, nothing wrong. Just weird packaging."
4,Lifelong fan of the Bandit and Sheriff Justice,"Smokey and the Bandit is an all time classic! Good action, great chase scenes, fast cars and hold your belly humor from the greatest of all time, Jackie Gleason. The all-star cast includes Burt Reynolds, Jerry Reed, Paul Williams and Sally Field as the sexy ""Frog"". Soundtrack is a winner too."
5,a good beer run,"For just good fun, what could be better than an 1800 mile round trip beer run with Burt and the gang in the 70's? As road movies go, this one is a classic."
5,Funny! Exciting! Awesome!,Action packed from the word go. Some of the best car chases in recent memory. Jackie Gleason is hilarious and will not soon be forgotten in this classic fast car fast movie.
5,Breaker breaker to the Bandit!,"This film is with out a doubt an all time classic, maybe the best comedy of all time. The plot basically is the ""fox and hound"" analogy Burt renolds being the fox and Jackie being the daft old hound dog. The Bandit(Burt Reynolds) getting chased everywhere in his black Trans Am by Justice in his clapped out police car which gets battered more and more as the film goes on. One of the classic parts is where they meet in the cafe and the sheriff has know Idea that hes talking to the Bandit.Bandit-""sombody chasing you sheriff ?"" Justice - ""Nobody chases me boy !"" Sheriff Justice(Jackie Gleason) was one of the funniest men in history and in this film Jackie creates a classic character which you will never forget! I watched this film first as a kid and even now when I watch it I still laugh very hard. Overall a classic beginning to a classic comedy trilogy."
3,Original sounds? Missing a scene that plays on TV movie version,"I've watched this movie so much on tv, dvd, etc. I remember a dvd version of this movie was remastered with different sounds from the movie. I'm currently watching it right now on blu-ray and hearing different sounds for the car, squeeling tires, and the sound of the semi.Also, there's a scene that's missing in this version...The scene that happens between Snowman digging Fred out of the pond and when Bandit pulled into the 76 station for fuel.......Bandit: Son, pull the hammer back. Smokey's coming at you in a plain white wrapper..Carrie: That's your policeman in your basic white car....Bandit: Very good...Snowman, c'mon back. I'm talkin' to you son....by this time Snowman comes back to the truck...Snowman: Alright c'mon what is it?..Bandit: When you get that d..n dog in the truck, you can put the hammer down because that smokey will have gone by you..Snowman: How'd he know that.There, that's the scene that's missing."
1,Does NOT contain the original sounds. Buyer beware,"The first dvd of this movie contained the Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtrack. If you purchased the blu-ray version all the original car sounds, sound effects, even some of the music will be altered or removed. Beautiful picture yes but the Mono soundtrack is not available and Universal has not stated for the reason why and have no plans to change a great movie that I grew up watching and loved when I was a kid. It's not worth it. If you can find the very first version of this movie on dvd, it has all the original sound effects."
3,Not as good as Stroker Ace but better than the 3rd and 2nd in this franchise!,"Burt Reynolds signature film but not asfunny to me after the first time I sawit in the theatre. Number three is slightlybetter than weird number Two that has Reed,Reynolds, Sally and Dom DeLuise(!) tranportingelephant to Dallas for Republican Party meeting!"
3,Lots of bad language.,"I bought this for my son and he thought it was hilarious. However, I had forgotten how much bad language there is in it."
1,Only plays on computers,I was very disappointed when I received this DVD. It boasts a new-and-better image technology. But you have to download and install their driver to use it. It won't play on my -fairly new - DVD player because I can't install drivers on it. I will say my money was promtly refunded when I sent it back to Amazon. -Dennis in Richmond
5,MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIMES SON----------N!!!!!,"IF NOT FOR THE MUSIC? THIS MOVIE WOULD BE LEFT WANTING.THE MOVIE GAVE JERRY THE INSPIRATION,THE MUSIC GAVE THE MOVIE IT'S HEART.JERRY'S MUSIC WILL LAST, LONG AFTER THE SHOW IS DONE!"
4,This movie will always make you laugh,"This movie is timeless! If you ever get the blues, pop in this movie, and I guarantee, it will cheer you up. Especially if you work in Law Enforcement. It makes me laugh to think of all the things Sheriff Beuford T. Justice gets away with, like chasing the Bandit accross state lines. I wish we, as law enforccement officers, were granted as much freedom."
5,East Bound and Down,"I recently bought the King of the Hill soundtrack. Included on the disc was a cover of Jerry Reed's song ""East Bound and Down,"" the song from Smokey and the Bandit. Hearing the new version immediatly made me long to see the film, which has been a favourite of mine since I was a little boy. This is one of Burt Reynolds best films ever and Jackie Gleason isn't too bad in it either. No matter what the best movie of the Twentieth Century is determined to be, there are two things wrong with it: No Smokey and no Bandit!"
5,One thrilling ride!,Thsi movie is my all time favorite movie of all time. But if your going to watch this movie make sure you watch it on tape or on HBO or something. Because it contains some very hilarious fowel language in it. Its such a simple story two funny guys bootlegging coors beer from Texarkana to Georgia for two stupit guys named big and little enos. All of the characters are great Burt Reynolds and jerry reed are funny and Sally Field is a babe. But I think the most funniest person is Jackie Gleason and his son traveling in a falling apart police car through the movie. Paul Williams is funny too but is only in a few parts. This movie is going to put in a good mood the music in it and everything. They don't make movies like this anymore.
2,Movie purchase,"I am satisfied with the purchase, but unhappy with the movie, I was looking for the original unedited version, the one I have is edited where can I find the original cut?"
4,"""East Bound and Down""","The high-water mark of the Burt Reynolds-Hal Needham ""good ol' boy"" genre, ""Smokey and the Bandit"" (1977) is an extended car chase with better-than-average scripting and terrific stunts. Of course, the film's raison d'tre remains Jackie Gleason's inspired comic performance as Sheriff Buford T. Justice - the Great One's best movie role in years. Effortless chemistry between Burt and Sally Field, with Jerry Reed and Fred the Basset Hound along for the spirited ride. Forget the contrived sequels and enjoy this legendary box-office smash. Immortal Dialogue: ""What we are dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law."""
4,Great Late 70's Anti-Establishment Truckin' Comic Flick,"Anti-establishment late '70s truckin' fun movie. Great flick with truckin', hot rods and CB radio-speak. A magnificant late '70s American movie. Great cast. Burt is perfect, as is Jackie Gleason as the ultimate redneck sheriff. (Jerry Reed is easy to ignore, but SHINED.) Sally Field shined as well. It's easy to see how Burt and Sally hooked up after this one in real life. The chemistry showed in the movie and helped make it real. Very funny. You need to watch it for what it's worth. They were'nt trying for an Oscar. (Thank goodness.) If you like a simple plot with car-chase action, you will LOVE this movie."
5,Smokey and the Bandit,Now this I bought for myself as a birthday gift. I love this movie and this is my dream car. When I was a teenager I could say each CB saying by heart that is how well I know this movie. Net Flix don't have al the Smokey and the Bandit just 1 of them and I don't remeber what one it is.
4,Easy to watch classic,"I enjoyed watching this classic after so many years of not seeing it. These are the sort of movies I grew up with and they are still excellent to watch. It was also a treat to watch a film WITHOUT computer generated stunts and WITHOUT swearing. An easy film to watch and one that I can enjoy in front of my 3 year old daughter.Also, if you like Pontiac Trans-Am, this is the film for you. I know my brother in-law will just watch the film to see the Trans-Am in action."
1,PG Version,"This is not the original theatrical release of Smokey and the Bandit. It is the""PG"" version. I will be returning this and ordering a DVD that is un-edited."
4,Pay attention!,Careful! I should have read the whole thing! Needs a Toshiba or Samsung HD player. My fault. I'll update this and let you knw how they do with returns. It arrived promptly so....sofar a 4
4,"Smokey and the ""BLEEP"" Bandit",Laughed most of the way through the movie! I just didn't remember all the profanity! I'm glad my 11 year old was in bed.
5,Just on the Nostalgia value alone,"I had forgotten how much fun the late 70's were. After seeing this on CMT and other channels a few times, my feeling was that ""this sucks just as bad as I remember"". But after seeing it on DVD in its entirety without commercial interruption(ha), the pacing and flow of the movie seems to stand up well, even though if you made this film today, it would only run 38 minutes, because all the car chase scenes would be edited in milliseconds. Not a bad period piece from 197X, at all."
5,Still Awsome,This movie is as good now as it was 30 years ago. My kids even enjoyed it. They still talk about scenes and use lines from the movie.
1,"Five star film, horrible DVD.","The transfer on the DVD looks like it's from a laserdisc print. The colors are faded, and the picture is too soft. Also, the disc is non-anamorphic and doesn't include any extras. Two thumbs way down for the DVD. This film would be a perfect candidate for a two disc special edition DVD with a remastered picture and sound track."
1,Default language is Chinese...,"...what does that tell you.This is a very grainy blu-ray; seriously, i'm not sure it would look any better than the dvd version on my Samsung UN55C8000. The only Burt Reynolds movies i was interested in seeing in hi-def were White Lightning, Shamus, Sharkey's Machine and this one. If the other ones are as bad as this one i won't bother."
1,Instructional video???,"I searched in Amazon for instructional video for fly fishing-anglers. This is what I wound up with. # 1, it's not instructional, other than you can watch & learn from another's triumphs & mistakes. From bumper to bumper, it's a commercial, from boat to gear, what they wear, what they think. Each program is just like the last, maybe a different boat, different gear. I wouldn't have accepted it free, if I could have previewed first."
1,Poor quality,Poor quality. This thing ripped in the first week. We have different skins from another vendor that are more durable.
4,Good Product,Nice rubber skin case that fits very well. Note that these are the old style. They don't have the thick more heavily padded end like that of the newer ones.
3,"I like them, BUT.....",".....I find that the regular square spatula is huge... you can't get anything out of a can or container with it, because it's too wide. I love the small spatula for that use, but it's already cracked (torn??) along the side after owning and using it for a couple of months. Another thing I noticed is that I have to be very diligent about keeping ""gunk"" out from between the silicone spatula and the handles.....where the two connect..... otherwise, stuff stays in the cracks. *blech*Overall, I like being able to use them for things on the stove, and REALLY like the size of the small spatula, but I think I will try another brand next time."
4,Very Useful!,"This set is very useful. The smallest one was still a little too big for some uses, so for me, I purchased a mini Le Creuset spatula, also on Amazon. The midde spatula with the scope is the most useful of the set. I have not had the problem with stuff stuck in between the handle and the head. I toss them in the dishwasher and it seems to be fine for now."
3,missing spatula,"I'm sure my sister will enjoy these but both of us were expecting to receive all three spatulas advertised as the set, not just two. The medium sized one, probably the most often used, was missing from the package with no replacements available. A disappointment!"
3,Clip on watch,The watch is OK. The battery for the digital part went dead in a week. The instructions are lacking clarity. Far too many unnecessary whistles and bells.Other than that it's a good time piece.
3,clip doesn't work,I bought this watch a few months ago. The watch looks nice but the clip sticks open and the face plate was not glued on properly. I wouldn't suggest that anyone buy this product.
3,"Nice, Chubby Pencils","My son uses these pencils all the time. They are nice and fat for his small hands. He loves the rainbow colored ones. My only quibble is that they are somewhat faint unless pressed hard, which my two year old is not yet capable of. Mostly they make soft lines of color, rather than a richer color. I'm sure as he ages, this will not be an issue, however."
3,"Same old, same old.","This book is like all the other unauthorized Ozzy books, with slight variation. If you are interested in reading about Ozzy, try ""Ozzy in his own words"", at least it is more accurate and truthful, not hearsay and taken from context in interviews. Dont get me wrong, this wasn't particularly a bad read, just a been there, done that type thing. It is VERY similiar to Sue Crawfords book, except this was a bit more ""fun"", meaning it has fact pages of each family member, it has quotes, it has quizzes, make for a little more interesting of a read if you are going to read the same stuff you have read before. This book happens to have more information on ""The Osbornes"" the MTV smash hit than Sue Crawfords book too."
1,A complete waste of time and money!,"Pedantic, repetitive, poorly written, littered with factual, grammatical and spelling errors. It seems that the author watched the tv series and ripped off a great number of magazine articles. He admits that this book was rushed, no doubt to capitalize on Ozzy's current resurgence. This belongs at the checkout stand at Safeway for 99 cents."
4,Good double CD mix of ambient pieces,"Two CDs of not-at-all dancey stuff. Some of the tracks have a slight Middle Eastern flavor to them. The moods vary quite a bit, from mellow to unsettling to spacey. A definite bargain."
3,"Probably better to just get ""Together for the First Time""","Just to clarify some slight mistakes of the earlier reviewer: This CD contains just 8 songs, and they all come from the first BB-Bobby live album. The label printed on the CD is wrong, it lists 10 tracks, but the last two songs are missing on the CD.The sound on this abbreviated CD is slightly better than the original first live album, in that it is remastered at louder level, which often means they took better care. The levels on the second live album are at higher, preferable level. I boosted the 4 additional songs from ""Together for the First Time"" by 6 DB when combining.I'm attempting to squeeze the two live CDs onto one, usually live albums have a stinker or two. So far, not smelling a whole lot of stink!I feel so lucky to have seen both Bobby Bland and BB King several times live back in the 1980's and 1990's. They both have great voices that come through in person. I have a severe man crush on both these guys."
2,REMASTERED?,"I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THESE ALBUMS REMASTERED. I AM A BIG P.T. FAN AND LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS SET. UNFORTUNATELY THE SOUND QUALITY IS VERY POOR. THESE OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL MASTERS. I HAVE SEVERAL HIT COMPILATIONS OF PAT'S AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS FAR SUPERIOR. ON THIS ""FOUR PLAY"" THE SOUND IS FLAT AND THE HIGH END CRACKS UP A BIT. WHY WEREN'T THE HIGH QUALITY ORIGINAL MASTERS USED?"
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"What did PT do to deserve this kind of treatment? It's hard to believe how bad this thing sounds. On headphones, these discs are absolute audio hell, the crackling is unbearable. What are the people at Majestic Rock thinking? Is all their other product this bad? The only reason I gave it the extra star is because the packaging is kind of nice, and I like the idea of Pat's classic stuff all in one package. But something's gone horribly wrong here! These first four PT albums are total classics, and deserve to be available in listenable quality. Actually two of them are: Buy the 2003 Universal Records twofer of 'Putting It Straight' and 'Heat In The Street' for great sounding copies of those two LP's. As for the first two LP's, I wish Universal, or anybody (who owns the Polydor catalog?), would give those the same treatment."
5,Mr. Deuterman does it again,"This is the fourth novel I have read by Captain Deuterman and he just keeps getting better. This story has a very believable plot, interesting characters and crisp dialogue. I really like this author's style. The story always moves along and doesn't bog down with excessive technical details as do some authors of this genre. I eagerly await his next book."
5,Hunting Season,The book was great. P T Deutermann is the best author I've read in a long time. All his books are good and suspenseful.
3,"Edit, edit, edit","Lose the paranoid bs, and you've got a readable adventure. This is way too wordy. How come a highly trained hero has to be saved by a novice, bumbling amateur?"
3,"Sigh....The reader is great, the content..not so much","Audiobook review... The narrator/reader, Dick Hill, is really good and is what kept me listening. I know this is an old book, but I just had to say this.I really dislike heroes who act like amateurs. Our hero, Edwin Kreiss, who is searching for his missing daughter stumbles into an ambush and the next time he goes back to the place where he was shot at...and guess what..he doesn't even take a gun...oh please.The bad guys are smarter than the ex-FBI agent with a reputation that belies belief based on how he acts in this story.Mr. Deutermann, go back to Cam Richter. He is a bit more believable.This ia an entertaining story, but the longer it went on, the more I wanted to scream at stupid FBI, ATF, you name it. Thank God they really aren't this ""inept""."
2,Beware -- Way too small,"These jerseys run way small -- beware. The Large is more like a small/medium compared to other companies. We lost money on shipping this item back because of the fact it was too small, but there was no way it could be used.The quality of the item was good, but that doesn't matter if it doesn't fit."
4,Good introduction to at-risk youth,"The McWhirter's book provides a nice introduction to workingwith at-risk youth. This book is undoubtedly marked towardsundergraduate students and as a result the authors do a few things that are a bt too ""cute"" for my taste--like using their poetry and sayings at the beginning each chapter and using a tree metaphor to talk about at-risk behavior. Also, I did not find the case studies particularly relevant but are probably fine for students with limited experience workings with this population. None of this though detracts from an otherwise wonderful book. The authors do a nice job of addressing topics like risky sexual behavior, violence, and suicide and a good series of chapters on intervention. Having said this, though, I think this is a very nice book, enjoyed reading it, and will recommend it to others who want a overview of at-risk youth. END"
1,Boring!,"Ok, I have to admit the scenery and the idea were good but the execution.. Not that well. I never actually understood the story of nutcracker and now even less hahah"
3,Huh!,"I have bought & watched Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake & loved it. The additions he makes to classical ballet I enjoyed. This Nutcracker however, I saw he changed the setting to an orphanage but then had trouble following the story as it progressed.The dancing was again very original & I enjoyed it once again. I had a large problem with the story line & felt that if I had not known the original story of the Nutcracker that I would have enjoyed this much more. The confusion hurt the experience on this one for me. I am going to find a show by Mr. Bourne that I am unaware of what is supposed to happen & see if that helps. 3 1/2 Stars."
2,What Nutcracker?,"Thinking outside the box is great, but I didn't care at all for this version which starts out in an Oliver-Twist like orphanage and later goes to a very pink, very bright land that makes Candy Land look understated. There isn't a lot of dancing, despite this being a ballet, and there is no Nutcracker, just a doll. If you want traditional, I'd recommend the Royal Ballet's production, but if you want unique, look around for some clips/previews before you try this one because it's very unusual."
5,Excellent for budget travellers,"London hotels are very expensive, but the B&B scene can be pretty overwhelming. Unless you're only looking for a chain hotel experience, this book is a must-have for anyone trying to figure out how to save some money on accommodations. Everything from youth hostels to boutique hotels are covered. The author does a complete write up of each property, so you have an excellent idea of what you're getting into. My only complaint is that it's too short, but as the author checks out every place personally, I guess she covers what she can."
2,Not that cheap,"When I saw the title of this book I thought it was meant for me but I guess I just have different definition of ""cheap"". There are a few ""cheap"" places listed in her book ...but not many, and not enough to make the purchase of this book worthwhile. I would recommed getting Rick Steves London or Let's Go. Both list more sub $80 dollar hotels than this book and are chock full of other useful information."
1,Cheap Sleeps ruins my trip to London...,"We stayed in the London Elizabeth Hotel near Kensingtom Park after reading the exquisite review in Cheap Sleeps. The author goes overboard describing the Hotel as wonderful beyond belief. It wasn't. I was unsure when I walked into the worn and scruffy lobby, but when they showed me to my very hot, stuffy and shabby ""family"" room (two twin beds with two cots shoved in!) I was apalled. Everything about this place needed help--the towels, linens and carpet were worn beyond belief and dirty. The room, bath etc, need a good scrubbing and refurbishing, the restaurant was closed and the service was minimal. OUr three day stay cost almost $800.00. Not cheap and not a good value for my money. Did the author really stay here? We were very disappointed and angry. J. O'Connor"
2,Slow and quick to die,"I've had one of these for a while, and I've finally gotten fed up with it. I need a new thermometer. This thing goes through batteries like chicklets and when measuring, the last 5-10 degrees can take as long as 30-60 seconds. Though I should say, in all fairness, that it is faster than an analog thermometer."
3,Not quite instant,"Instant for this thermometer means 5-10 seconds.Also, I accidentally dropped my Pyrex thermometer in some standing water and didn't notice for a few minutes (until I was done with some dishes). That appears to have shorted it out, and it won't turn on again (even with a new battery).For the price, it worked well enough, but I wish it was more rugged, and had a faster response time. 1 star off for each."
3,like we really needed this,"big pun joined the make more cd's while I'm dead club along with 2pac, biggie, and eazy still if you're a diehard fan this is way your taste than mine ashanti's on here who have never met pun before his death and you know fat joe pops on here too."
4,Great collaboration for a great past rapper,"This album commemorates some of Big Pun's greatest hits including ""still not a player"" ""banned from TV"" and the recent hit ""thats how we roll"" this album is great because Big Pun's rapping style is great and he made it popular to bring a latin sound to even hardcore rap sometimes. When he said boricua in a song it started a latin rap trend that has carried on to such latino's as Angie Martinez and I personally like the style. I would give it a 3 and a half for some crummy songs but heck he's dead so I gave him a 4."
4,rest in peace pun,"not a bad cd but how many unreleased songs come out when an artyist dies,unbelievable now pun is on that list some rappers refuse to stay in the grave."
4,SICK!,"True hip hop fans come get yours! Big Pun's new CD is so ill. Despite 2 sub-par trax, this compilation of new and old songs is soooo good. If you are looking for some real hip hop and superior lyrics, listen to Big Punisher's Endangered Species!"
5,Must have,"This album is a must have for any Big Pun fan. Christopher Rios will be missed, but his music lives on and will always be remembered for his mastery with words. A Society for the Commonwealth Master Lyricist, Big Pun delivers where others fall short. This CD is the best way to get to know this man's lyrical genius. If you have to have one Big Pun album, let it be this one."
4,Endangered Species - The Late Big Pun,"Even though this is like a greatest hits album it still has a regular place in my CD player. Tight songs such as 'Still Not A Player', 'You Aint A Killer' and the unreleased 'How We Roll' are just 3 of the 24 dope tracks from the album. On this album you can truly recognise Puns lyrical genius. Some of the tightest lines i have ever heard are featured on this album. 'Banned From TV' is another song from the album featuring Noreaga, Jada & Cam'ron. That song has one of the dopest beats !! The only bad side is the fact that it is a tribute album, although it is good value for 24 tracks although its not so good if you have Capital Punishment and Yeeeah Baby you'll find some of the tracks repeated.Peace"
3,Breathe and Sleep,"My husband has been using Breathe Right a long time. He sleeps better which allows me to sleep better. :-)However, we can purchase it at our local Wal-Mart at a similar price, so it is not better to order on line."
1,Not helpful for snoring at all,"I bought this product after reading reviews about how effective it is for controlling snoring. However, I wore the nasal strips for almost two weeks with absolutely no change in my snoring patterns. My girlfriend kept a tab on whether there was any improvement with daily use, but it did not work for me at all. Would not recommend this product."
3,These work great but...,"I'd used Breathe Right strips for years, but got a bit put off by the cost and the fact they weren't reusable. For a long time I'd been trying to find an alternative with no success. While Breathe Right strips didn't stop my snoring they did minimize it and they also worked great while exercising but I hated wearing the all-too-visible strip on my nose. Breathe Right strips certainly have a niche but I found theSnorepin(TM) - The Smarter Solution Against Snoring and Sleep Apnea (Advanced Design Save Your Lungs)to work just as effectively and it's FAR less visible not to mention reusable. TheSnorepin(TM) - The Smarter Solution Against Snoring and Sleep Apnea (Advanced Design Save Your Lungs)is not quite as comfortable as the Breathe Right strips but I quickly got used to it. While I've been a Breathe Right user in the past I've shaken that off and moved on to other solutions."
3,"Sometimes works, sometimes doesnt","Bought this for my mom who snores really loud. After wearing them, she still snores during the night, but the amount of times i wake up because of her snoring has decreased. So although this product works in that it decreases the amount of snoring episodes during the night, don't expect for it to completely eliminate all snoring."
4,Really works,"When I slept in the same room with my grandsons and they couldn't sleep through the night because of my snoring, I knew there was a problem. I asked my wife and she said it was pretty loud but that she was used to it. The first night that I used one of these, I was MUCH quieter, and now she is sleeping really well. It does what it is advertised to do, and sticks quite well to my nose."
3,Help to breathe,"But may face gets swollen after a night with a strip. Maybe there is some glue component, but it looks I'm a bit allergic to something that these strips contain."
4,Breath Right,The Breath Right works the majority of the time and I get a better nights sleep. Getting the right size is important as the smaller size didn't work for me.
3,some improvement,"First night I did notice some improvement with my family member's snoring but nonetheless he still snores. But he said that, he slept better than usual so idk.."
3,Does an ok job,"My husband snores both from the nose and from the throat, so this is how we address the nose snoring issue. They help a bit, but, well, his nose is really big and it doesn't seem to work terribly well. It does work, or we wouldn't use them, but they're pretty uncomfortable for him. If you have a hard time getting them to stick, try using toner or some such on the nose beforehand to dry up the oils."
2,"Large was a mistake, even the regular sizes are a bit weak","I'm a big guy, the large are meant for Toucans or other large beaked birds. Buy regular size.Breathe right produces a newer stronger version that I use. These were a bit weak at lifting open the nasal passage and I'd still sore a bit with these on.Their other products are much better."
4,Breath Right Nasal strips,"I always use this product, but thought it could not be the same product because the price was 1/3 of what I would pay for it at Walmart. However when I received it, I found it was the same product.I wish they would make a little bigger strips, with methol but this is the biggest one they make."
1,Tears skin off,I do not have sensitive skin but here I am at work with a big purple mark across my face. It was excruciatingly painful to remove the strip as I attempted to pull it off as slowly and gently as possible. Then someone comes up to me at work and says that the same thing happened to her husband. Be very careful! It also did nothing to help me breathe better with a congested nose.
2,Breathe right review,"I purchased these breathe right strips for my mom who become very congested and has a hard time breathing when she lays down and causes her to breath through her mouth which leads to snoring. She felt that the product did not work for her and she continued to have the same symptoms when using the strips. To be fair, I think this size is too big for the average nose. Be careful about the size, maybe a smaller size would have been better. This one was a large, but when I got the box at home I read on it that the average person needs small or medium strips."
4,RIVER STILL RUNS,"LRB has been one of my favorite bands. Through all of their mutations, they've managed to retain their impeccable harmonies and tasteful melodies and musicianship.This 2005 collection isn't THE NET or NO REINS, but I found it extremely listenable. LRB staples Wayne Nelson and Stevie Housden are still much in evidence and the new members acquit themselves just fine. In this decade of rap/hip-hop/teen fluff, I enjoy this reminder of good pop music. Long may this river run."
1,A 'Test Of Time' that failed,This is probably one of the most bland albums I have ever listened to. I have tried and tried to get into it but failed. There is nothing to get your teeth into and quite frankly it is boring. This opinion is nothing to do with LRB politics it's based on my musical taste... I do not like it and would not recommend it to anyone.
1,Audio Unaudible,This 8 disc set is so quiet I can barely hear it. Love the poem. Hate the quality of the recording.
1,this is not how a great intellectual mind should be remembered,"Robert Fomon was my grandfather, I dont understand this mans bias against a man he didnt know. My grandfather died when I was in 3rd grade, and this is not how I hoped he would be remembered. Despite the mishappenings dealing with EF HUTTON, I would appreciate all those to refrain from posting rude messages on the morals of my grandfather, for the same reason I would not critisize a family member of yours who I knew nothing about."
3,A very interesting story about how a large business can fail.,"E.F. Hutton reminds one a lot of Enron, as a company in a rather stable and profitable business (i.e. a brokerage and natural gas) goes into risky business they don't have any real expertise in because it has more prestige. (both move into trading). Both had executives incapable of steering the company back into profitability, Enron's because of dishonesty and Hutton due to incompetence. But most likely the major reason for Hutton's fall is the simple fact that it was unable to change as the market did. When this finally caught up to it, the only thing to do was to sell out at a bargain basement price.One reason that I can only give this three stars is that author seems to have a grudge against the company, especially Bob Forman, that comes out in the language used. Such when Forman breaks his leg, he's described as ""crawling on his soft, flabby gut"" There are other examples that cause the reader to sometimes wonder if this a hatchet job."
2,nice but...,I read the book and it was well written. I am unfamiliar with the author and his knowledge of Kabbalah. I would highly recommend Rabbi Aryeh kaplans works. He is highly regarded in this topic and his books are well written
5,Quite Profound Yet Extremely Practical,"I've read a number of self-help books in my life. And I've read quite a few books on Kabbalah. This is the first book that has managed to make it all so clear and simple. I read it in about 90 minutes. Then i read it again 2 more times. This books lucidly explains who we are, why we are here, and where we came from. If world leaders and the world's religions lived by the extraordinary principles presented in this book, the corruption of religion would cease and people would be empowered to transform their lives and truly change this world. Like the books says, this wisdom is the seed of all wisdom -- the true secret teachings of life. I recommend it to anyone who desires personal peace and joy!"
5,Finally a manual for life!!!,"Never had Kabbalah explained in a simpler way. This is a ""must read"" book for anyone that is serious about understanding anything in life. You never had it so simple, easy to understand & use. After you read it you want to let everyone know about it. Soon you'll be writing a review for it. It makes the this great wisdom of Kabbalah tangible, actual, concrete and usable. Thank you Yehuda :-)"
5,Wow!,"An amazing and life changing book.Forget that countless celebrities are linked to the Kabbalah. Its MUCH bigger than any one person.Its up to you to take what you want from this book - but there are SO many logical and easy (to understand) principles to help you improve your life, that I believe by just reading this book alone, it can help you to make improvements - just by your being more aware!naturally, its a lot more difficult than that if you wish to make permanent and life changing changes, but this book is the perfect start!"
5,It works !!!,"This is not just a book this is the cookbook for life. This guy knows what he talking about. It made me look and see things in my workplace and family in a totally different way. He his talking in a language I can feel like close to, I loved it."
5,worth every penny,"I just bought this import with the bonus live dvd of the whole REALITY album performed live in front of a small intimate crowd, and I must say I am blown away. David Bowie never ceases to amaze me. He is one of the greatest musicians of the past 100 years. Not only is the album itself amazing, but his live delivery of every track on the album. This version of the album is a must for any fan even with a hefty price tag. You will be amazed at how well this album is done live. Just Bowie and his band on a small stage in front of a small crowd. He is truly a gem to watch weather you are a new or old fan."
1,Bluuuuurrr,"Readers in the US might know James Herbert better as the creator of Fluke, the dog. His excellent book was taken totally out of context and turned into a kids movie. How Mr Herbert let that happen I have no idea!!!I have been reading Herberts books for years now and have enjoyed every single one of them... except this one!!!I read this about 3 years ago. It has to be the worst James Herbert book there is. Not only is the story slow, boring and badly written, the ending is terrible.The only blessing is the fact that its not too long although it still feels like a slow death.If you are new to James Herbert, avoid this one and go for Magic Cottage, Ghosts Of Sleath or The Shrine (the best).cheers"
1,Slow plot and weak characters,"for one thing, the book was slow - it took forever to get exciting. But most maddening was the character of Ellie. She was supposed to be a police officer, but she was a complete and total wimp, constantly breaking into tears and having to be comforted by the hero. She was completely unbelievable as an officer of the law, and completely unprofessional as well - it is ridiculous that she would not call in the cavalry as soon as Kelso was kidnapped. She doesn't even wait to see if he's okay before driving off on an errand of her own and then manages to get herself captured as well when all she had to do was make a single call to the precinct to come and rescue them both. She was there only to be the love interest and a victim that Kelso had to rescue. Their romance was completely contrived and unrealistic also, and I was annoyed at Herbert's habit of calling her the ""girl"" in a demeaning fashion when she really should have been called a ""woman"""
1,All these reviews are bullshit,Take a look at what else these guys have reviewed. The first on reviewed a bunch of books with all 5 stars. The rest have only reviewed this one. Looks like a bunch of shills to me. Don't trust them.
4,Thought provoking set of essays on the Anglo-Saxons,"This book is a set of essays, based on presentations at a workshop. One wonderful feature is that the Q&A discussion after each paper is also included -- so you can actually see some of the top Anglo-Saxon scholars struggling with an issue.I thought all of the essays were very good (a rarity in collections like this) and some, such as Charles-Edwards on kinship were outstanding."
5,"Great song, great voices!","I knew this song would be a hit from the first time I heard it. The lyrics are very touching. The singers do a great job with the song. The other song on the CD single, Looking Over my Shoulder, is an upbeat and catchy song. I definitely recommend buying this - you'll be able to say you were a fan from the beginning because I have a feeling this group is going to go far!"
1,boring .. boring.. boring,"This is the worst romance book i ever read. The story line is boring, the hero is a brute and the heroine is spineless. I just dont understand why after all the abuse the hero heaped upon the heroine, she still could fall in love with him"
3,Not the color on the cap!,"The bottle shows a turquoise color, but when you spray your hair it is actually VERY dark blue. Cool color, but not the one on the cap!"
5,foot stomp'n rawknrawl weekend,"The ghettobillies have managed to return me to my schoolgirl days. The joy that I experience while listening to Butterface can only be compared to such an experience. I don't know where you boys come up with your ideas and frankly I don't want to know. There's some things we'll just chalk up to ""nature's little mysteries"". If you're a line dancer, this CD's for U. If you shop at the mall, this CD's for you. If you get that old-fashioned feeling about a girl in your church, this CD's for U. If you like a brisk and spirited sexual experience, this CD's for U. If you've been wonderin what that Digeridu in your basement does, this CD's for U. Or if you just want to figure out, once and for all, your sexual orientation (or complete lack thereof)then this CD's for U. Bravo, fellas. Lookin forward to your next compilation of orgasmic delight. Eddiebaby"
3,Mirren is good but not nearly a Glenda Jackson,"I found it hard to watch this movie without comparing it to Glenda Jackson's outstanding performance in the 1971 BBC series ""Elizabeth R."" Jackson's performance was just superior, though Mirren is nothing to scoff (definitely better than Cate Blanchett's performance).This version, however, was a lot more graphic than the 1971 BBC version, depicting the hanging and goring of condemned traitors (yikes!).Definitely not for the squeamish.This movie was also a lot more graphic of intimate, one-on-one time between Elizabeth and the men she loved, while other versions don't depict her as having nearly so much private time.The costumes were just fantastic, and there was definitely a larger focus on development of other characters."
5,"Wise queen, intriguing woman","Elizabeth Tudor was a master politican and an amazing, moral woman. She was the product of the ultimate disfunctional family but turned her personal saddness into the leadership skills that produced the world's unstoppable navy which remained unparelleled until the German u-boats of the Great War. Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons are an excellent match and a delight to view. ""Elizabeth"" is a triumph in historical storytelling!"
2,Where is part one?,"By the time this series picks up, Elizabeth and Leicester are like two much settled-in spouses. The story seems to be en media res. Though the cast is excellent, the plot just lumbers along. There is no fresh adaptation of her biography, a disappointment from such admirable producers.I disagree with one reviewer who claims Elizabeth here is too flightly, too flirtatious, too vain. In fact, history shows her to be exactly that, from her youth throughout her adulthood.IMO, the best series about Elizabeth's personal life is the 2005 version with Ann-Marie Duff.For a more historical version, see the Blanchett version although that one tries to cram in every aspect of Bess' life and times and so suffers from it.I love Mirren and Irons in everything they do -- but they deserve a much better film than this one to display their genius."
1,A Joke,"I am amazed at all the reviewers who loved this rendition of the life of Elizabeth I, yet decry every other film version of her life (save Glenda Jackson's). True, Helen Mirren is a great actress and does a fine job with the material. But the interpretation of her relationship with the Earl of Essex (among other things) is ludicrous. Cavorting around with him like he is her lover? True, he was her 'favorite' after his step-father, the Earl of Leicester, but their relationship was more mother-son. I'd take Ann-Marie Duff's The Virgin Queen anyday - even with its modern touches, it is a much more accurate portrayal."
5,"EXCITING movie, well acted!!","This is an exciting, action-packed movie! It is not a cerebral, ""Masterpiece Theatre"" wordy drama (although I love those too)! It has political intrigue, humor, thrilling action, and fantastic acting that really brings that period alive! The screen fairly crackles with energy!!"
3,Mirren and Irons.....way too old despite being magnificent actors!,"I am not comparing ELIZABETH 1 with any other version of the Queen's life that I have seen.For enjoyment purposes I am not concerned with dramatic license or any possible historical inaccuracies.Simply put, the screenplay lagged alot and Mirren and Irons are simply too old in real life to be playing these parts.This was one of the oldest castings that I have seen in a film since Kevin Kline as Cole Porter in DE-LOVELY! Only so much belief can be suspended when it comes to actors ages and looks.Make-up and lighting are not their best friends!I came into viewing this with the highest of expectations, but came away with a ho-hum sort of feeling and a little bit tired!.Hugh Dancy (The Earl of Essex) continues to impress in every role he takes.Toby Jones as Cecil the Younger continues hitting the perfect mark in his career choices.I'll let you duke it all out who are arguing about Protestantism,Catholicism and Mary Queen of Scots!!!"
2,Dull and slow moving,"If you're looking to learn more about Elizabethan England, you could do much better than this snooze. I fell asleep during the movie. It reduced Elizabeth to the role of frustrated but disciplined virgin. Re-enactments are laughable. The pace is slow."
4,"Good, but there's better","Helen Mirren is very good, and her more recent turn as Elizabeth II in The Queen only helps to confirm her widely acknowledged skill as an actress.However, for a more accurate and alternate depiction, Glenda Jackson's portrayal in Elizabeth R is more spot on. This BBC series has the advantage of being more thorough since it charts Elizabeth's life, as well as mental and emotional state, before she ascends the throne to the very day of her death. The supporting characters, such as Walsingham and Burley, are better fleshed out and the actors' portrayals of these characters are much more memorable."
2,Condition New? I question that.,"The packaging of this DVD was in poor condition when received. The paper cover under the plastic of the case was folded and creased and did not appear to have the original factory wrap and was missing the adhesive bar code label that is on the top edge of a new DVD case. The description of this DVD was posted as 'NEW', which I seriously doubt!!!!"
2,Not my favorite version,"The acting in this mini-series is quite good, though I could have done without the graphic torture and beheading scenes. I realize these things actually happened in those days, but do we really need to see the axe slicing through the neck of Mary Queen of Scots? Spare me the gory details! I prefer the film 'Elizabeth' starring Cate Blanchett and the Masterpiece Theatre series 'Elizabeth 1: the Virgin Queen'. Good acting and well written without the unnecessary gore."
2,Gore and sex don't make up for inaccuracies,"I expected so much more from this cast. But all we get here is Elizabeth portrayed as a frustrated, half crazy old maid making out with a boy young enough to be her grandson. (In history Elizabeth was in her late sixties and Essex in his late twenties) Where is Elizabeth's steely strength? Elizabeth I. would never have reduced herself to such a sniveling fool. She had more character than this. Frankly, I was uncomfortable watching Bette Davis and Erroll Flynn as lovers in a movie that obviously inspired this drivel...and they were closer in age than Mirren and Dancy. But this just disgusted me, I'm sorry, plus no such thing ever happened. Essex was Elizabeth's last favourite, but there was no sexual relationship between them. Add to that a useless gore overkill that just sickened me. Mediocre at best."
5,Fabulous Production,"Helen Mirren and Jeremy Iron's performances are magnificent. This is a first rate production all around. There are some unbelievably gory scene of torture and executions, not for the squeamish (I had to close my eyes). The costumes and make up are sensational bringing the royal musueum portraits to life."
2,Is good acting everything?,I am surprised by how people are raving about this. The historical inaccuracies are definitely worth mentioning despite the great performances. The acting is indeed fantastic but it cannot possibly be described as accurate. It is HBO's usual sensationalism. To hide the glaring errors they just add some scenes to make your eyes pop out of your head. I'm not sure I'll ever recover from the seemingly endless torture scenes. Sex and violence makes up for anything it seems.
4,Eliizabeth I--Helen Mirren,I saw ELIZABETH I: THE VIRGIN QUEEN first and loved it. This production was not as captivating. I'm not a historical buff so this review is purely from an entertainment perspective.
4,"Very good but,,,",Did anyone with a backround in enlish history see this movie? I'd like their take on it. Of course I'll have to read up on this woman because it does make for an interesting research project.
2,A triumph of style over substance !,"I found myself bored many times with the inadequate and repetitive script of this series, with the gushing Essex and unbelievable scenes in the royal court of the queen romancing her toy boy.This is an over long ""Shakespeare in Love"" with lots of gloss rather than a serious drama.The BBC's lavish ""Charles II"" series also tackling royal affairs of the heart is leagues ahead in terms of acting, drama, screen play and script."
2,Mediocre,"Though this book has a TON of recipes, you will only use a select few. Some of the recipes are just ODD, and others sound great but turn out terribly unappealing--sorry, but true. I use my breadmaker a lot and I only use this book for the sourdough starter recipe..."
4,the biggest book indeed,"This is probably the biggest book on bread machine that you can find in the cooking category. I only wish that there are pictures. I'm a sucker of cookbook with pictures- They encourage me to bake more just by looking at the pictures. If you decide to buy this book, do not buy the previously published bread machine cookbook by Better homes and garden. This book included probably 95% of the recipes included in the previous book"
2,Not enough yeast,"Here's the problem with this book - too little yeast. I own a Zojirushi bread maker that's excellent. The accompanying recipes work out fine. However, for every 3-4 cups of flour, Zojirushi recommends 2 tsp of yeast. For the equivalent amount in this book, the authors recommended about 1. Every loaf turned out bad until I upped the yeast. I can't figure out what the authors were thinking."
5,Review of Bread Machine Recipes Book,Excellent book - wonderful recipes - anyway can make wonderful bread with a bread machine using these recipes. Highly recommend - very easy understand.
5,Bread Machine Recipes for Daily Use,"I have found many recipes in this book that I am so impressed with. I wouldn't know what to do without it. I am so very glad that I bought it. I looked at many books, but they had recipes that I would never use. I especially love a rye bread recipe. I use it about 3-4 times a week. My family loves it. I have other cookbooks for my bread machine, but this one is the best. If you have a bread machine, get this book."
4,Why I bought the book,"I first checked it out at the library, I wanted to copy a few recipes that I wanted to keep. The coloring of the printing didn't make the copies usable so I ended up buying a copy of the book and am happy to have the entire book in my possession."
2,not that good,"I was disappointed. Wonderful ideas but when I went to do the recipes in my bread machine, NONE of the 10 recipes I tried came out!! All were doughy; not cooked thru. I measured all ingredients EXACTLY. I even changed brands of yeast. It isn't my new machine; I tried recipes from my old machine and some I found online and all of those worked out great.This book does admit that all recipes have cut the amount of yeast. I compared my other bread machine recipes and saw that BH&G; kitches have cut the amount of yeast by as much as TRIPLE!!!Wonderful ideas but very poorly done."
2,Big disappointment,"So sorry I wasted my money on this book. The recipes are too large for my machine. Some of them sound good, but since I have a 1 pound machine and all the recipes are for 1 1/2 & 2 pound machines, they did not do me much good. I was not expecting the soup and sandwiches portion of the book, either. If I had wanted soup recipes, I would NOT have bought a cookbook about making bread. It is a very nice looking book, however and lays flat for easy reading. The recipes are easy to read, also. Format is good."
3,Good recipes,"This book is very informative, with lots of hints for alternate ingredients. The breads are basic, but very tasty. Had no problem with the dough rising and the loaves look very appetizing."
3,So-So,"The first time I tried a recipe from this book, I thought it had too much salt and not enough yeast. I was right! Since then, I have increased the yeast by about 1/3 and decreased the salt by about 1/3, and they are about right.The alternating orange & blue type is supposed to make it easier to read, but it makes it harder. For some reason, you tend to skip the orange lines. Be careful not to leave out ingredients!I do like that there are separate lists of ingredients for medium and large loaves of bread, and the recipes tell you which cycle is recommended for each recipe.I wish there were some pictures of some of the recipes. No pictures makes it feel like a cheap, fund-raising textbook or something. It doesn't feel like a professional recipe book."
1,not much information----not worth it.,"This has very little information and is poorly organized. There are 3 listings of places to stay, a good number of restaurants, but very little information on attractions/history."
2,Not worth it...,"Sorry, this was not worth even the 5.95 to download. While the reveiws are unfiltered, they are also random and with very little content."
1,Piece of garbage,"Jams up very easily after just a few cranks. I tried to power through it, and wound up breaking the cheap plastic that attaches the handle to the spreader. I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
1,Newer version is a disaster,"The new version has a seam just underneath the spreader rotor that allows dust and debris into the gear mechanism. It will cease up almost instantly. I've used one of the older ones for years. Scott's are you listening???I'm actually Craig Gregoire, of Blue Ridge Termite the actual user of this product."
1,Jammed After First Use: Do NOT Buy,"The first one I had worked great for a couple of years. Then, the handle broke off (made of cheep plastic). I got a new one from Home Depot. During the first 10 minutes of using it, it jammed up, just like the other reviews stated. I would not buy this spread, if I was you."
1,Complete junk,"This is the worst thing I've ever seen in yard tools. Any material you try to spread will jam within the first use and it is down hill from there. The hand crank is so flimsy, it came off in my hand ...twice because I exchanged the first one thinking it must have been a dud. Nope. Total junk. Scotts: Please stop wasting everyone's time."
2,Jams up,"Anything that's a little powdery gets into the gears and jams up the mechanism, and it can't be taken apart for cleaning. Maybe a perfectly uniform product like manufactured fertilizer would work well, but I have tried using organic lawn fertilizer and Lily Miller lime and they both jam it up.UPDATE: I successfully freed up the mechanism by soaking it in a bucket of water and spinning the broadcasting rotor by hand.UPDATE #2 I drilled some 3/4"" holes in the bottom that expose the gearing so I could clean out the junk and spray the gears with silicone spray. That really made it work well."
1,Newer model is junk!,I have used these in my business for years. I used to get 2 years easy out of a unit and I use it commercially and abused it knowing a replacement was cheap. New models don't last two weeks without jamming up and breaking the hand crank. We have broken 4 or 5 of them in the last 4 weeks. I'm switching to the Earthway brand.
2,Mine Broke,It worked ok for a cheap hand spreader. I like the ergonomic design but don't bother with a hand spreader. Buy one you push like a lawn mower instead. Mine jammed so many times until the handle broke. Thankfully I bought it at Home Depot and they took it back. They gave me another one which has not broken yet but it is only a matter of time.
4,Great for hunting/fishing realists,Good videos for entertainment purposes. The hunts are realistic and Tred is a pretty entertaining character. Other than the water safety they are not instructional or meant to be. More just a view into the life of a bow hunter and fisherman.
5,funny,"This DVD was hilarious. My wife even enjoyed it. If you enjoy wildlife, or just humor, this is a great DVD."
4,I like Les Claypool,"I knew of Primus and owned a couple CDs, but I never really got that into them. When I heard Les was joining up with Trey and Copeland I lit up. This CD will give us some idea of the direction of Oysterhead and it's great for those of up that weren't into all of that ambient distorted sound of Primus. I love this CD, it sound like King Crimson dipped in funk."
5,Andrea Bocelli is super!,"As always, Andrea Bocelli's singing is touching, sensual and very expressive. You can tell it comes from his heart and inner being. I do prefer the tracks with only him singing, but he harmonizes very well with those with whom he sings. Sit back, relax and enjoy!"
3,Good Title... This book is BASIC,"This is a college level textbook for complete beginners in the field of Real Estate and specifically Real Estate Appraisal. As such, it gives a nice overview of the profession and of appraisal techniques and not a whole lot more. To get more in depth to the level of feeling professionally competent, you will need to add on with other books and classes. But this is a very good start."
2,Some other books are better than this one,"I don't know why colleges use this book as a required textbook. This book is DEFINITELY not a good book for someone who is new to real estate apraisal. The book did't explain things very clear especially some very important things like ""Highest and Best Use"". There are some other book that explain the real estte concepts better than this one. You definitely will not pass the real estate appraisal exam if you only read this book"
3,RE Appraisal,"This is a great book that is used in some of the colleges for textbook. It explains the fundamentals of real estate appraisal by using pratical examples which we may experience everyday. In addition, it clearly shows the calculations, number by number with detailed explainations to make the readers easy to understand the concepts. It really helped me a lot in the real estate business."
3,its a text book,Its a text book for college courses. If you think it is going to be anything other than that you are confused. It will help you pass a state realtor's exam but there are probably better ways to prepare.I got this book because it was required for a course I was taking.
5,A Fantastic Example of Yesturdays Best Country!,"If, like me, you love yesturdays country music, you don't want to miss this one! Just look at the titles! This is a great collection! Albums usually have lots of fillers and only one or two good songs, Not the case here! All the songs are wonderful! This is not todays country, This is a great collection of yesturdays country hits!"
3,Bad info,"This is not so much of a review as it is a critique of the product information. This is NOT a 7703 bottom bracket. The spindle width for the 7703 bottom bracket is 118mm. In addition, the 7703 is a sealed cartridge system, whereas the 7700 is not."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings about spending $16.00 on 1 boxer brief. I tried these out and love how they are light, breathable, and wick moisture away from your body quick. Why am I paying almost $20.00 for 1 when they are made in china? Somebody else needs to get in the nylon boxers market quick."
1,complete failure of design,"I don't know how all the reviews are so glowing about these, I wonder if they are fake reviews.These underpants are designed so poorly that it looks like you're wearing them back to front, for a man of my size I probably have quite a small bum yet these are so tight on my bum yet it looks like I'm wearing a cloth nappy on my front, there is so much excess fabric that there is no support for the crown jewels, and it seems like they are designed to encourage chafing.Barely suitable for a walk to the shops, let alone hiking."
3,look for something better,"i just bought two pairs of these underwear and they feel really nice....true to size, comfortable, good fabrics BUT i am very disappointed that i hand-washed them and hung them out in my bathroom in the night and the next morning they were still WET.....i bought them mainly because of this feature....so if u are looking for something really quick drying DO NOT buy these bottoms"
2,"For those who like to wear their undies ""wet""..",Bought these in California anticipating trip down the BaJA and hoping for quick dry results: washed night before in bathroom of San Diego hotel; next morning.. shorts still WET!!! was leaving for Dallas and on to Costa Rica.. had to pack these in a plastic bag and wash again when I arrived... cotton dries quicker than these frauds... I wouldn't buy more if they were reasonably priced... and they're not..
2,Maybe not for me,Bought the small size and it fits on my waits but it gives me more room on my groin part. Maybe not for a short person like me or my body type.
2,Not what I expected,"I did a lot of research before I bought these, after all you spend more time in your underwear than any other clothing..I found that these weren't really for me.The downsides:1. They ride up my legs- I longboard, and by the time I push off a few times these are riding up pretty badly.2. They don't wick away moisture- The weird thing about these boxers is that they don't really get wet. They don't absorb any sweat so it just lingers on your body. As a result, you start to stink way quicker.The upsides:1. You can wash and dry them in just a few minutes.2. They keep you cool.3. They look decent."
1,Poor Material,"I bought five pairs of these to start replacing another brand that I've worn for a decade. In the first week, I wore two and washed them...both had serious piling of the material. I didn't expect such low quality material from Ex Officio but they are ""Made in China""...you get what you pay for."
5,Super quick drying. Feel great against the skin.,"Yep, these actually do dry very quickly. Probably only 2 or 3 hours max to dry. Also, these things feel great. They're way more comfortable than my usual cotton Hanes underwear. I might even switch to using these daily."
4,ExOfficio,Most amazing underpants I have ever worn!! i want to replace all my briefs with these ExOfficios. Soooo nice and comfy.
5,perfect,These are great boxers. Bought one as a test trial and now I plan to replace all my underwear with these.
5,Extremely Comfortable!,"I have been wearing Calvin Klein boxer briefs for quite some time and although comfortable, decided it was time to try something different. Looking at numerous brands wherever I could, I accidentally stumbled on this brand and the ExOfficio company surfing Amazon. So after doing a little research and reading some very strong positive reviews, I decided to try a couple pair and see for myself. They are honestly the most comfortable pair on boxers I have ever worn. They are very lightweight and yet very supportive at the same time. Although they are a little more expensive than the ""average"" pair of briefs, I certainly think they are worth the extra cost. I highly recommend these and can't wait to try other types of products from this company!"
1,not comfortable,These bunch of and are very uncomfortable. i think its because i hike and cycle a lot and have larger thighs then most people so the tight part of the brief slides up. Still the material lives up to its claims so i ordered the boxer version of these and I've been wearing them comfortably since. if you think you might be built like me then just get the boxer version. I'd give those five stars.
1,It wont stay in place,"You know how when you haven't done the laundry and you run out of underwear, you go to the drawer to get your backup underwear...the underwear a little too tight, a little too small, a little too big, the underwear that caused you to buy the new ones to replace because the originals were uncomfortable now, or unwearable for some reason?That said original uncomfortable underwear is better than this. When I got this I was excited from the description. Opening the package and first feeling them, they felt interesting. Smooth, silky, stretchy. I thought ""cool"". Until I wore it the next day. These things ride up and bunch up something awful. I find myself pulling this thing down every minute like a woman who wore a skirt she knew was too short for her. Smell wise I don't really notice a difference. One thing that I find kind of annoying, but I guess it is by design, after wearing it, ON AN AVERAGE DAY, it slightly feels moist to the touch. Going back to hanes."
5,Fit and feel great,These are the best feeling underwear I've ever owned. I bought a couple pairs for backpacking and loved them so much I decided to replace my entire wardrobe with these. Well worth the extra cost.
4,"Very nice fit, kinda itchy","great boxers, these feel especially right in dress pants for some reason, and they fit great and feel great in dress pants. but for some reason whenever i wear these drawers with jeans they make the upper part of the thigh itch really bad, im not sure if its just me or not, but otherwise these are great"
5,Comfy for hiking,"These are comparable to Duluth Trading Co's Buck Naked Underwear, another great product. I got a great deal on them and love them!"
3,"These feel great, but not worth the money","Liked:- stretch- feel- very breathable and comfortable- good support- won't stainI do like these but:- if you have big thighs, the nylon will stretch/run in the back of the legs- they cost too much- why would you want to only take 1 pair of underwear on a long trip?So while it'd be great to have a drawer full of these, I have to wonder why anybody would buy a drawer full of these when you can get a 4-pack of normal underwear for half the price of 1 pair."
4,ExOfficio is no UA,They stretch out over the course of the day not nearly supportive enough for what i was looking for! Not comparable to UA boxerjock!
5,Perfect fit,I bought these as a gift for my husband because he is very picky and generally sticks to what he likes. After reading the reviews I decided to see if I this brand could be added to his preferred list. Total success. Would highly recommend
5,ExOfficio Men's Give-N-Go Boxer Brief,Bought these for my fiancee. He said they are the most comfortable underwear he has ever worn. Very happy with the purchase.
3,Okay Performance,"These briefs provide decent performance. They do dry fairly easily and are comfortable, however over time my pair have stretched out. I'm a fairly lanky guy, and so this comes as a surprise to me, as I'm not sure why they are suddenly ballooning out and looking generally depressed. I own two other pairs of 'quick dry' boxer briefs, and they have held up their beatings without any qualms.For the price, I can honestly say I'm disappointed in them."
5,Boxers that fit!,These are high quality boxers that really fit.Comfortable to the point that you easily forget you're wearing them!Good value at a good price!
5,Ex Officio is the best underwear,"These and the briefs. Amazing, and others aren't really close. If it were more socially acceptable, I would give these as gifts. If these were a little cheaper, I would have already phased out my old underwear for these and the briefs."
5,worth every penny,"Like the ad, bought 2 pair, then rinsed one/wore one while on 2 week trip to Europe. The sticker shock is quickly offset by the comfort and ease of maintenance. Dont know why I didnt know about these sooner. Have donated most of my old Fruit of the Looms to Goodwill. From now on nothing but Ex Officio."
5,deserves all the praise,"I feel silly reviewing underwear, but there you go... this product deserves the praise. I used to wear cotton knit boxers all the time, but I got tired of them riding up (and having to pull them out of my crotch all the time, causing embarrassing scenes) and getting hot and muggy down there due to the cotton material. Enter the Give-N-Go Boxer Briefs!They ride in place, no riding up. They stretch and conform to shape comfortably. They do NOT hold moisture or odor. Yes, the price is a bit steep for underwear, and I initially only bought two pairs. After wearing them for a few days, I immediately ordered five more. Now I've got one for each day of the week! :-)"
4,exofficio boxer briefs,I received my first pair as a gift from my son and I was hooked. After the sticker shock I ordered 2 more pair. They are the most comfortable briefs I own . After a days wearing they don't sag and look as fresh as when first put on. I'm sold.
2,Another boxer brief that runs small for an Asian guy.,"I've been having a lot of issues with boxer briefs that ride up and I've been on a non-stop quest to find the perfect underwear. Unfortunately these underwear feels like a medium even though I ordered a small. They are the most comfortable piece of clothing I have ever worn. But since the fit felt too big for me, the boxer briefs ride up easily and it makes my underwear saggy."
3,They are OK,"Sizing: I'm 6'3, 220, 37 waist. The large seems to be too big. They are little loose like boxers, especially in the crotch. For $18, I would not go this route again. Hanes sport boxer briefs at the store are about $3 cheaper and fit a whole lot better. These exofficios also ride up the leg with general wear.Drying: I did try out the speedy wash/dry. Yes, they dry quickly. This is a bonus; however, I have not compared this to other makes with the same general material. Is it really that special? I don't know, maybe I am missing something. But these boxer briefs don't seem to be worth the money I paid."
3,"Decent, but can be uncomfortable","I usually prefer the compression shorts type boxer brief, but they can be rather suffocating for my nether bits- so I decided to try something a bit more breathable. I have two pairs of the regular Exoficcio boxers and I love them, but I do like a tight fit when wearing jeans so I picked up a pair of these to try out. They ride up a lot, I'm constantly adjusting them all day long when I wear them. It gets old, real fast. I don't think they would have this problem if they were a bit longer on the thighs and slightly tighter. As they are now, they are too short to keep a good hold on your thighs so they tent to ride up during daily movement. I'm not unhappy with the purchase, and I do still wear them on occasion, but I think they could have been designed better."
5,exofficio,[Very pleased with the product and postage rates. Arrived safe and sound on our doorstep in Australia in a very reasonable time.[ASIN:B001M0MN16 ExOfficio Men's Give-N-Go Boxer Brief]]
2,ExOficio Men's Boxer Shorts,"For me they did not fit - the side is a bit tight. I returned them and decided that I would stay with the traditional men's boxer shorts. There is nothing wrong with the shorts, it is simply not my fit and style from an older perspective."
5,Most comfortable,"I replaced all of my cotton shorts with these ExOfficios, they are that comfortable! They fit snug without digging in, dry fast and feel rather sexy too! No more soggy cotton on those hot summer days."
5,Never Thought I Would Love a Pair of Undies!,"What can I say? They're great, and people should know about it. Expensive, though, but what you wear underneath is just as important as what's on top, right? Great purchase, very happy."
5,Necessary For World/Extended Travel,"The ExOfficio Boxer Brief is the best underwear out there. Period.Get over the price-scare - yes, $25 is a lot of money for underwear, but they're well worth it.Fits well, reduces chafing, wicks sweat, fights odor.You can live on two pairs of these - wash one at night, wear the other. Wrap it in a towel, stomp dry - should be ready in a few hours.I purchased a medium and a small. I'm 5'7"" tall, 30"" waist, and the small is a better fit."
3,"Alright, but didn't do it for me.","Saw all the great reviews and understand the desire to get rid of the cotton undies. Liked the idea of something I might wear for workouts and/or for day to day wear. And like the quick wash/dry idea for possible traveling light. So bought one pair to try. At the same time bought the Addidas Climalite Performace 2-pack to try. Both felt similar in that they were lightweight and stretchy. Like the feel of both. Wore both a few times before deciding I liked the Addidas better. The ExOfficio did tend to ride up a good bit. With the Addidas I never think about having them on. That's what I want. No riding up the leg nor wedging where it shouldn't. Could just be the fit of one vs the other being better for me personally. So while I like the ExOfficio, I am buying more of the Addidas which I like better and are less expensive."
5,Excellent briefs,"I bought 6 of these for my husband, because the one we'd purchased locally prior to that had quickly become his favorite pair of everyday briefs. Now, he has one for each day of the week, and although they're not cheap, I think they're worth their weight in gold. So far, after several months of wear, they show no signs of degradation, and my husband says they're the most comfortable underwear he's ever had. He also wears them when he works out at the gym and loves their wicking ability. My teenage son is now requesting some, too, so I'll be placing another order soon."
4,Well worth the price,"It's a great underwear if you're active and especially if you walk around the city all day. It doesn't retain noticeable odor since it dries up fast and also reduces chaffing. The best thing it is that it doesn't ride up like most boxer briefs do. Material seems to be of good quality.One thing though, I am 5'9 and ordered a size XL and I wear size 38 pants. The XL felt a bit loose around the crotch area but quite comfy in the thighs. This may be just a personal thing since I usually prefer underwear that fits like cycling or compressive shorts."
3,Size problem,I ordered two pairs XL size and they are way too small. Normally I wear 40-42 size and according to chart XL should be right for me. Shipping and Amazon return policy awesome.
4,Good boxers,"I wear these to work all day and theyre comfortable. It's not easy for me to find great boxers with teh right comfort but these have come the closest so far. I still haven't tried other brands like UnderArmour or Calvin Klein, but the CK ones are $26 a piece... I've ordered 5 pairs of these total since it seems like theyll last me 2 or maybe 3 years it'll be worth it. Over a few more months I'd like to have about 10 pairs to replace all my boxers."
2,"Good, but sadly un-durable","I just wanted to point out that I only wore the boxers for about 4 times, and they started to rip. The inseam part has already been snapping off(the threads) which is not what I expected from a product like this. I payed well over the usual price for a similar product hoping that It would last, but sadly it didn't."
3,good product but over priced,Excellent product however its a little too expensive. I would only buy it again if it was on sale. It is comfortable and feels good overall however I rather get a three pack of calvins for the price. I guess If i need to have only a few pairs on a excursion journey of some sort these would be worth it.
5,Best pair of underwear I own...and I own Under Armour,"Best pair of underwear I own...and I own Under Armour. So that says a lot. It says ""Im willing to pay for quality and for comfort.""But Im here to tell you there is no comparison. These are by far the most comfortable pair I own. They are amazing. Hands down the best. They are like Under Armour compared to a regular t shirt. No comparison."
5,Perfect!,"These really are the best underwear around. The fit, material, and comfort... nothing beats ExOfficio. I even gave them as gifts. They are that good!"
4,"Great, but pricey.","Probably the most comfortable boxer briefs I own, but pretty pricey for what is not much more than a small amount of material. I can't help but think at half this price I'd own 10 pairs."
4,Perfect but pricey,"These are perfect for hot weather. They are very breathable, quick drying, great fitting, but also expensive. As great as they are, if I did it over again, I would not have bought them, just because they are so expensive. Try to find a good deal on them somewhere else."
3,Failed to Control Middle Eastern Odor and Moisture,"I run about 4 miles a day and I have always had problems with moisture and odor in ""that"" area (i get really wet as someone said it once!). I was hoping this boxer would help to eliminate moisture and odor produced by my b**ls; however it failed to control my Middle Eastern moisture and odor. My odor beat this boxer. I am going to give this another try and this time I will attempt to wear 2 at the same time to see if it makes a difference. If this fails, I will start to take shower 3 times instead of 2 and cut off spicy food."
5,great product,Seems to be a great product. Definitely different than anything else I found in any store. i'm excited to put them to the test.
5,"Very comfortable, no chafing!","Like a previous reviewer mentioned, I probably have more fat on my thighs than I should which leads to chafing with regular underwear. I took two of these on a 5-day canoe trip through the Florida Everglades. They dried quickly, prevented chafing and were very comfortable for extended wear. At this price I won't throw out my current supply of underwear, but I'll probably work these in as replacements as the others wear out."
1,Men's Giver-N-Go won't stay up,"These boxer briefs are made of Nice material, but they are useless to me after only a few times wearing them because the elastic waist band is no good and lost it's elasticity and then the darn floppy things are always sliding down inside my trousers. No, they were not machine washed in hot water...I only hand washed and rinsed them in warm water while showering. And they don't dry near as quickly as my cotton shorts do."
2,Not very durable,"As others have mentioned these are comfortable and air dry well. But after a few times in the washing machine, they were scuffed significantly in the front. Considering I used the gentlest setting on a fairly modern washing machine, I expected them to be more durable."
4,Very comfortable,"I am very glad to have found these boxer briefs. I was in love with the spandex/polyester shorts I bought from REI 15 years ago and lasted most of those 15 years. When I finally had to start replacing them, REI no longer carried them. These are not exactly the same, but they're about 90% as good. I haven't tried to use them for extended, multi-day wear like they are advertised, but they are very comfortable and give and stretch as needed. They don't have any seams or panels placed in awkward or uncomfortable places like Jockey and Hanes. They feel very good against the skin and the breathe well to reduce that sticky feeling in the summer."
4,a little pricy but great underwear,"I like the fabric, it's light and feels confortable on the skin. I got one size smaller than my normal unrewear and it fits great."
5,Best boxer briefs available,"These really are the best boxer briefs that I have owned. They are comfortable, fit well in all the right spots, and don't stretch out. The material is soft and comfortable. The waist band is snug but not too tight. There are no annoying tags poking you. After my first purchase of these, I ordered 2 more right away. They are a bit pricy but you get what you pay for."
4,Would've been 5 stars if the legs were longer,"I can echo the praise of other reviewers for light, comfortable, fast drying, etc. If only the legs were just an inch longer, I would be truly happy with them: my thick thighs chafe sometimes."
5,Awesome,"They are very comfortable and stand up to frequent wear. I'm a 34-inch waist and ordered size large, which was perfect for me. I got these for a two week trip to Hawaii, where I would be doing a lot of hiking and water sports. So they had to be comfortable either wet or dry and I'm happy to say they were.They didn't chafe while hiking and were great to wear under board shorts in the pool or the ocean. They are not quick drying(they will dry overnight), but they are very light-weight and comfortable when wet.Buy with confidence, you will not be sorry."
3,Not for hiking!,"I purchased these underwear hoping to find something I could wear hunting/hiking/backpacking that wouldn't cause the dreaded chafing on the inner-thighs that will cripple you in the backcountry. Sadly, after 5 miles in on a backpacking trip, I was starting to feel them rub me the wrong way. In denial I pushed on and by the next afternoon had major chafing issues and had to switch to an old pair of boxers and walk bow-legged. These underwear might be great for travel but if you are planning putting some miles on them, you will feel it. The main problem seems to be where the seams meet and create a pressure point that starts to rub after constant motion. So I'm still searching for the anti-chafing underwear...."
3,review,boxers are a little more loose fitting than I had hoped. Not a bad choice but probably will not order more.
3,"Great material, ok fit",The material on these boxers do exactly as advertised. It's pretty incredible as they wick away any sweat but I found the fit to not be satisfactory. I have several boxer briefs and these just don't fir right. They're a bit baggy and sit too high above the waist.
4,Not the same as they used to be,"The style of these has changed, and in my opinion for the worse. These used to be a loose fitting boxer, but they are now more like a tight fitting boxer brief. The quality and material is still just as remarkable though. Had I known that they fit was tight though, I probably wouldn't have ordered more.However, these are still great boxers, and it's hard to bash them because they perform well.I only give 4 stars because I don't like the fit as well as my older ones (which came loose fitting from the store)."
1,As long as you don't mind the runs...,I bought two pairs of these for my trip to Costa Rica and they arrived the day before I left. Both pairs ended up having runs in them by the end of the week. If I hadn't thrown away the packaging for them I would be shipping them back for a refund. Other than that they performed as advertised. But for the $$ I would expect them to be more durable.
3,They are ok but not shorts for sports,These breathe well but that is about all. I didn't test them as my only pair of underwear for 15 days like some reviewers so I can't testify to this. For me these are the worst of both worlds. They have no support like boxers and yet they still bunch up like boxer-briefs. I have only worn them once or twice and don't see wearing them again.
5,As good as most people here say,"I bought these for my husband and despite the excellent overall reviews, I only bought one pair - just in case he was in the minority. Well, the other day, he said, I want to replace my entire drawer with these. Not sure about the longevity/durability as it has only been a month, but so far so great."
5,Great for hiking,Wore these hiking thru Glacier National Park. Really comfortable in hot weather. Easy to wash and dry quickly. Nice product.
4,Almost perfect briefs,"They wash very easily, they dry quickly, pack small, and they are very, very comfortable. Almost perfect, 4 1/2 stars. However, my black pair are pilling a bit, and showing little white-ish bits of fiber on the fronts of the thighs. I think they are bits of fiber from inside pants pockets which get tangled in the fibers of the briefs. My gray pair seem not to do this, or maybe just don't show it."
3,"Eh, okay","So, purchase a pair of these because I was sick of the 'Hanes' and 'Fruit of the Loom' pairs riding up, sweating through them, and loosing elastic so quickly. And these are an improvement over the 'typical underwear'. However, I did also purchase ""Champion Elite Active Fit Boxer Brief 3 Pack No Ride up"", and these fit and wear so much better. For the money, the Champion Elite is much better! The ExOfficio still 'rides up', and picking wedges is umcomfortable and embarrassing! Maybe a small would fit me better? Not sure, I am a 34 waist and the sizing guideline said to go with a medium. Not willing to drop another $20 to try the small....... The material feels nice - smooth and soft.Overall the Champion Elite are a better choice in my opinion, no ride up, and cheaper per pair."
1,immediatly ripped/ruined,followed the instructions for wash and presto the hole in them renders them unwearable. wtf!!!really disaapointed as i bought 5 pair.
3,Better than cotton but not perfect,"I picked up a few of these after hearing some great reviews and can't say that I'm super impressed. They have a great lightweight and soft feel but aren't anything special when it comes to performance underwear. My go to underwear for performance use has been Under Armour's boxer briefs. The only real difference between Under Armour and the ExOfficio boxer briefs is the fit. They are both a Nylon/Spandex blend but the Under Armour boxer briefs fit tighter which is a benefit if you have muscular thighs like myself. The ExOfficio boxer briefs are just too darn baggy in the crotch for my taste. When you get running,walking,hiking on the trails nothing will keep you perfectly dry but to keep from chafing is huge in my book!"
3,good for travel but not odourproof,"This is a pretty good pair of boxer if you are a hiker or frequent traveler. The boxer sits good, doesn't roll up (great when you drive) and wrinkle. But they are far from odourproof. The traces of urine smell terribly on these undies since they stick to the fabric. Also drying time is not brilliant as advertised. Overall not a bad purchase but there is a lot of room for improvement."
4,"Great, not worth the money","I saw the awesome reviews, and decided to just blow some money, which I never do. And I never will again. I'd say these are worth $10 max.-ProProbably most comfortable boxer briefs everbreathablelightweightdries somewhat fast-ConVERY expensivestinks up even after one day of hiking (not anymore than other underwear, but certainly not what they claim to do)still chafe slightly with themReally, this is a great product, and a lot better than normal boxer briefs. But be reasonable, and buy something cheaper. It's too much for a pair of boxers, idc how rich you are."
1,Not as pictured,I ordered these thinking they offered some support but they are just as roomy as regular boxers. The leg openings are snug but other than that they were a disappointment.
4,My new favorite underwear,"You really can wash these in the sink with soap if you are overnight somewhere. Not that you have to. You can of course also wash them in the machine with the normal stuff. I find myself rooting through my drawers drawer to pick out a pair of these drawers. They are superior to the others, even with the tag in the back which I usually have to cut out with extreme prejudice. They are expensive, so I'm buying a pair a month until I can rotate out all of my old stuff."
5,"I am very happy with this product, fully recommendable","This product looks amazing so I decided to give it a try.I fully recommend this product, I am going to order 10 more"
5,Very comfortable!!,I'm very happy! These breathe much better than other more expensive ones. I use these for running they dont roll up my running is much more comfortable.
4,Not snug,"In general I like this product. The material is soft and wicking. The waist band stays flat and at the waist where it belongs. The legs are not quite as snug as I would like but they generally stay down in position while standing or walking. They cover adequately without binding. I am pleased with the way they feel and wear.They are about twice what I feel comfortable paying for underwear shorts but I guess that is the price I pay for allowing myself to reach the X-Large level.I will purchase more of this product, just not in bulk."
5,For my boys,"Three generations of men in my family LOVE these! We backpack a lot and these hold up, rinse, dry really well."
5,The best!,"Our son loves these boxers. He did a ""study"" of which were most comfortable and these are his choice."
2,Fit well but,The fit is great but why would I want to wear chemical laced underwear on my body? I wore these for one day and what was held in place got inflamed and raw? So much for sensitive skin. I will not wear these again.I should have read the description closer. If you have sensitive skin don't buy these expensive underwear
5,My husband loves them.,"My husband loves these, and now has several pairs. They have held up well through many washings. They are a good value, we will definitely buy these again."
5,Excellent,I had recevied some previous pairs as a gift. These are great boxer-briefs; comfortable; light weight. Well worth the money!
5,Skeptical - but won over.,"I NEVER want to pay this much for underwear. But I'm tired of cheap stuff that not only doens't fit, it hurts me. Time to get stylish and comfortable and take a chance. I'm glad I did. I'll have to buy some more. I don't like paying this much, but I also have no tears that my Hanes, et al would have had by now - so maybe durable as well and worth it in the long run in more ways than one."
2,Where's the....,"... ""cradled"" feeling? I was expecting more in a boxer brief than what I got here. No pouch?!I won't be buying these again."
5,Best boxers ever,"I wish I could afford to only own these exclusively. It's like a treat every time I get to wear them, especially in the summer or while traveling."
4,Comfortable but kind of pricey,I really like these boxers. They are very comfortable. My only issue is the price. I will look for them on sale before I buy any more. Amazon seems to have the best price.
5,Great Puchase,"Just returned from a very long travel adventure and had purchased three pairs of these briefs before I left. First, they are the lightest and most comfortable briefs I've ever worn. The difference is so great, I can't wear any of my old briefs now and plan to throw them away. My old briefs lost their shape after one wearing, especially in the leg. As advertised, these briefs were great for travel. I rinsed them out at night and they were dry by morning. This will give me more packing space in the future and my underwear drawer just got a lot more spacious. Great product."
4,Pricey but worth it,"Based on other reviews I bought two pairs for a long trip where I didn't want to bring a lot of underwear or pay outrageous hotel laundry fees. I wore a pair, washed it overnight, and wore the second pair the next day while the first dried out. Worked out great and would recommend to other frequent travelers."
4,Maturing Rapidly,"They've come on in leaps and bounds since _Simon Basic_. While the basic ingredients are the same - male and female vocals, indie guitar and judicious application of synth - I found the end result a lot more satisfying.While 80s nostalgia abounds in both the lyrics and the band's overall sound, this time it's a lot less...well, twee and cutesy. I know that was the appeal for some people, but to my ears it's made the band's sound a lot more distinctive.If you've never heard Barcelona before...uh, they're kinda difficult to describe without using reference points, really, I tend to classify it along with bands like the late lamented Pulsars and The Rentals (and maybe Stephin Merritt's stuff, although it's not in his league lyrically) - American indie with synths and strong 80s influences (hence the recent appearance on March's Human League tribute album)."
5,"I think ""Otogi Zoshi"" is it's original Japanese name","At the peak of the Heian Era, famine and diease tear the country apart, deadly assasins fill the court, and wild bandits, infest the countryside. The legendary samurai Minamoto is sent on an Imperial quest for an artifact that can restore the world. but his skill with the bow cannot save him from illness, and his young sister is force to take his place."
3,Good While It Lasted,"I purchased my Toastmaster 1750 Preppy Food Prep System about 3 months ago. It was a great kitchen tool. We used it to chop onions, tomatoes, mix guacamole and gravies, and other items. One day, when making tacos, I attempted to grate cheese (This is on page 11 of the instruction manual). Unfortunately, one of the plastic flanges on top of the blade broke, rendering it useless. I contacted Toastmaster via their 800 number and was told that they couldn't find the replacement part (#70590) and would ship one if they found it. We have yet to hear from them or receive a replacement blade. I believed it was an excellent product. If it breaks like mine did, I guess you're out of luck."
3,"Not as Expected, very disappointed!","Sadly I purchased this volume based upon other reader reviews. Although I have given it 3 stars- as the book production itself was very nice- oversize square small coffee table book, printed on high quality thick stock, with well printed art work- makes this volume attractive on the outside. The contents and sketchbook is rather a let down. 60% of the sketches are very crude and unattractive (even considering them just sketches from a sketchbook) and the remaining art being just okay, maybe there is 10-12 eye opening pieces. If your looking for inspiration or eye candy this is not your book"
1,Crappy Bar napkin sketches,"The following is an opinion for which we are all entitled: Although this book does tell you something about each artist and shows one sketch from each artist, it is more like a ""Collection of bar napkin sketches"". Most are of poor quality as if the artist could care less when he/she had drawn them and a very few are of some quality. As an award winning artist of over 35 years experience, I felt it was a complete waste of money as far as being helpful to further my talents or to ""just plain enjoy"". I would never show such ""doodles"" in a book to represent what I can do. For something to glance through to kill time, I would say fine, go nuts. Overall....I AM NOT IMPRESSED!"
4,Truly frightening expose of FDA betrayal.,"The author, a long-term expert in the field of psychotherapy, lays out a frightening picture of how the FDA serves not the people of the United States, but the drug companies. He shows how the pre-approval drug tests were doctored (no pun intended) to allow the FDA to approve a ""mind-altering drug"" whose effectiveness in battling clinical depression rivals that of placebos.Before you take Prozac, or before anyone you know takes Prozac, get and read this book.Believe me, you'll run, not walk, to some drug-free way of handling your depression"
2,Alarmist propaganda,"I'm a psychiatric nurse. Peter Breggin is well known in the field of psychiatric medicine as being anti-all drugs. Has prozac been overprescribed or mis-prescribed? sure. but this drug and the class it belongs to have helped WAY more people than they hurt. penicillin and other antibiotics can kill you too if you're allergic and don't know it. and antibiotics are WAY over prescribed if you ask me and other professionals. i've worked in state psychiatric hospitals and i've seen a LOT of people who only got out and back to the world because of medication. i would hate to think that a book like this would turn back the clock to the old days when there was no medication and people wasted their whole lives in the hospital. GET A GRIP: ANYthing you put in your body has side effects and you can die from taking too much Tylenol, too. picking on this drug is a cheap trick"
1,Peter Breggin is well known as a Quack,He uses scare tactics to sell books and get on TV shows. His views are not supported by most and are at best offensive to all that can benefit from the advances in medicine.
4,Talking Back to Prozac,"This book was full of very factual information. This author is very well versed in psychiatric drugs and their effects on the body and our society.The information provided in this book, helped me keep a steady path when dealing with a family member who was taking Prozac and flying high without emotions or regarding for others feelings.The data in this book only validated what I had experienced with my family member and others who went to this drug for help. There are many alternatives to these drugs and people just need to search for the truth.I can also recommend his book - Toxic Psychiatry."
2,Meh,"It told me things we already know-- some info is inaccurate probably because of how much time has passed and advances in medicine/technology. If I had purchased this book when it came out, I'm sure I'd have given it more stars."
1,This book hurts people,"There are side effects to Prozac but it doesn't deserve this kind of treatment. Too many people have been helped, compared to a few that have been hurt. Likewise, Eli Lilly hasn't been completely aboveboard, but that should not obscure the fact that this drug has saved so many lives, families, and jobs. The author uses as much pseudoscience and pseudojournalism to trash Prozac as he says its supporters use."
1,Horrible,"I taught I was going to be getting a Techno CD but I got like a Aerobic music lol, too bad I was in Iraq and my net connection was not that good to preview the songs. Do not recommend it."
5,One of the must have four,"This is the second studio album from the Ramones, and is one of the first four albums, that you should have if you are a fan and/or like Ramones"
3,New Haven Local,"This is a less than accomplished piece of fiction, but its setting in New Haven makes it valuable and fun for us locals."
1,Lighter than fluff,Come on now. When a review analyzes a work of genre crimefiction like this as a socio-political study it is hard not tosee the author reviewing his own work with a heavy dose of self delusion and way sad ego. Not to mention desperation.I read this on a train home in NYC hoping it would be a gripping read. There wasn't much to grip. This is faux crime fiction only lighter. I GOT BURNED.
1,Predictable? Predictable!,"A piece of trite nonsense from Delta Goodrem's vastly overrated and over-hyped first album, 'Innocent Eyes'.Let's face it, people cannot possibly be buying this stuff for the music! Can they? Delta is a package you buy - the actual quality of the music recorded on her CDs is a minor issue!Who and what is Delta Goodrem?Delta Goodrem is an Australian answer to Britney Spears - sans the dance moves and tarty outfits."
4,A Good Read,"This is a good romatic mystery. The characters are well written and the plot keeps you interested. However, if the recent real child abductions disturb you, don't read this book -- that is the subject."
4,Good for history buffs. Good book,"Excellent history book. A period of history little known. A dangerous time and some good stories.I liked it. Good for genealogists,if you are related to someone mentioned here."
5,"Gentle, thoughtful, yet very informative book","I read this book by way of mental preparation as both sets of our parents age. Written from a Christian viewpoint, the book sensitively describes both older and younger generation's viewpoint of the aging process. Both would benefit from reading!"
1,Does not include red pegs,The red pegs were what I needed and the extender kit arrived without them so is useless. It's probably better to order through Lascal directly.
4,The Amazing Story of Superman,This is one of the most extensive Superman documentaries in the market right now. The only repair I have is the superficial attention given to the comic book of the character. I wish they could have gotten John Byrne interviewed for this special. This documentary is an excellent addition to any Superman fan.Image quality and sound on this DVD are excellent. This DVD has no extra features other than Chapter Search and Subtitles.
4,For the Superman Enthusiast,Any Superman fan will enjoy this look at all the supermans in cinematic history.
5,"Not just a promo for ""Superman Returns"" or ""Smallville.""","In Stanton Lewis Heck, Jr.'s review of this dvd, he dismissed the documentary as a promo ad for the new movie and the recurring television series. What he failed to mention was that not only does this documentary go all the way back to before Superman was a character in DC Comic's stable, but only the last 15 mins of this documentary focuses on ""Superman Returns"" and 10 mins centers around ""Smallville."" Every facet of Superman is reviewed in this documentary: From the short lived ""Superboy"" television series to the even shorter lived and rarely seen ""Super Pup"" show featuring actors in dog costumes playing the cast of Superman in the 60's. This is a great two hour ride along the history of one of the most recognizable figures in history. Great documentary and definitely worth the $9.96 price tag."
4,Casi perfecto,"Me encantó, fascinante historia, reminiscencias y la historia de uno de los mas grandes superheroes de todos los tiempos. Sin embargo una precisión: en la contraportada dice que hay subtitulos en inglés y francés, sin embargo el DVD solo tiene subtitulos en francés y en ingles via Closed Caption. Es uno de los pocos, por no decir, el único detalle que falla. Por lo demás, fantástica producción, además de los recuerdos de un George Reeves siempre grande. Un homenaje y el recuerdo de uno de los mejores."
4,"Good Research, but not Complete","While I liked the Documetary and having Kevin Spacey as the Narrator was a god touch, there is some info that was neglected. There were other Superman Cartoons, like the one from the 1960's and the one from 1988 that were neglected. They never even showed the differnce between the two actors that portrayed Superboy in the 1980's. I know that Kevin Burns and Bryan Singer's main focus was on the release of Superman Returns, but neglecting some of the past doens't alweays help. Over all though, it was well done."
4,It's a bird It's a plane...it's a super spectacular,I enjoyed every moment of it from the early years to the present. I have all six seasons of the Adventures Of Superman w/George Reeves on DVD. I highly recommend this for every fan of The Man of Steel.
3,could have included more,"It was very informative on the comic book history and so forth, but I felt they should have spent equal time on the making and history of all the theatrical projects (I.e. Kirk Alyn serials, Lois and Clark, Smallville....).But when a documentary is being produced by one of the films' directors, it's probably going to be a bit biased. If you've ever seen Superman Returns, its easy to see what production inspired Brian Singer."
4,Erf,"Very enjoyable. Brings back old memories of the serials, TV show and the movies. It's well done and very informative."
5,Cool!,"I only really knew about Superman after watching the trailers for 2006's ""Superman Returns"" and ""Lois and Clark"" on tv. I loved this tv special because it covers the entire history of Superman, from it's creation in 1938 to the Superman movie collection in the 1970s and 1980s to its modern day tv show ""Smallville"" and now the next movie on Superman ""Superman Returns"". A great addition to any Superman fanatic and a Superman novice, like me!"
3,This is only a promo for Smallville and Superman returns,"I loved the first two Superman movies. I loved the brief part in this documentary about the history of getting Superman and Superman II on the screen. However this documentary main focus is on ""Smallville"" and ""Superman Returns"". This documentary offers nothing new to fans of Superman."
1,Why Buy The Special Features,"I admit I haven't seen this and I definitely would if it came on the Superman Returns DVD but I am not going to buy the special features by themselfes before the actual movie is out on DVD. And if this is not going to be on the Superman Returns DVD, too bad...The 1 star is for the blatant effort to rip DVD buyers off, again..."
2,Terrible,"I'm not the kind of person to poorly rate a show I hate but I was just so disappointed. I really just don't understand what happened... Whitney Cummings is hilarious but this show is clearly unfunny. The jokes seem pushed and plots overwhelmingly predictable, not to mention that God forsaken laugh track that completely kills any humor the show manages to russle up. I gave this show several chances and its continued to disappoint, I don't recommend it for anyone."
2,"A laugh track, really?","I started watching but quickly turned it off. A laugh track, really? The 80's called and they want their tv shows back. The jokes weren't all that funny."
1,Take it off the air,"You know a show will tank when almost every joke has to be about a sexual reference. Very pathetic. As usual, every trailer for a new show is filled with very funny excepts so I decided to watch the pilot. What a waste of precious time that was. She is not funny. Gone are the days when you had to be naturally talent comic to be on tv. Now if you are willing to show some skin you can have your own show."
4,This shoe is hilarious,"Good show about everyday issues, not like seinfeld's show about nothing but still a great comical over the top over reacting circumstances show. Glad I can see it on amazon whenever I miss a live showing on tv."
4,Very funny,"I really liked this sitcom, but it took me forever to download it. Maybe it was because there were so many episodes. It would download a few episodes then it would say limited space available, please delete files. So I had to delete some other tv shows and books just to download the whole series completely. The show itself is funny and there were never problems with it after it was downloaded."
1,This is one of the worst shows ever!,"Seriously I have no idea who in the world approved the making of this show. It is the worst show ever! Nothing about it is funny the pilot sucked. I watched another week just to see if it was just a bad pilot, the answer was no it is just a bad show. I love her other show two broke girls but this show needs to be cancelled!!!PS the laugh track on this show is horrible!!!"
5,Promising!,"When I was 6 years old my grandfather took me to see this movie. The only scene I remember is a fight scene in a bar where the buffalo came in and kicked a bunch of people around. I assume that it probably stunk since I have never heard of it since, but it still holds a couple of good memories for me. The next year my grandfather died. This is a morbid comment huh? Does anyone know if it is possible to still see this move? I wouldn't think so, but who knows. Thanks for reading. I had read somewhere that this movie was based on a true story. I really can't imagine a real guy riding a buffalo around, but it was in Oregon so I quess they had ""tree huggers"" all the way back in the 1800's."
1,OMG...NO,"I saw her on Jay Leno one night. Unfortunately, I found this new show to be incredibly annoying. I think I would now prefer a hot poker in my eye over watching this show again."
4,Love the show,Whitney is a hilarious sitcom. I always think of my girlfriend and I in the first few months of our relationship. I get a ton of good laughs and the humor is naughty. So I can't complain!
5,A satisfying season finale,"I have really enjoyed the who season of Whitney. It is funny and clever. The season finale is about Whitney and Alex decide to get married, which goes against what Whitney has always believed that marriage isn't for her. As simple and basic as they try to keep the wedding plans, they run into lots of obstacles and delays. They manage to conclude all of the struggles to their mutual satisfaction. I am looking forward to next season."
1,Mistake,"I never ordered this, can't get it removed. Watched one episde on TV, hated the show due to STUPID dialogue and CRUDE vulgar references to all kinds of twsteless and NON-FUNNY crude jokes. PARENTS - DO NOT LET YOUG KIDS SEE THIS STUPID SHOW!!!"
5,Soccer DVD,It is a EA Sports pc DVD & I enjoy owning all their older games + this year came highly rated.
4,Why Don't You Just Drop In,"This is a great cd release and I'm sorry I waited so long to get it. These are performances recorded after The Cheerful Insanity album but before the first King Crimson album. In fact, it was during these recordings that Ian McDonald was asked to join. Several of the songs here would end up in the setlists of the original King Crimson lineup and I Talk To the Wind was redone for In The Court Of The Crimson King. One of the two versions of I Talk To The Wind on here would end up on 1976's A Young Person's Guide To King Crimson. If you're a fan of King Crimson, you'll dig this."
3,For Completists Only,"This is a compilation of bootleg-quality live recordings from 1967-68, all of which previously appeared on the ""Queen of the Moon"" boot a few years ago. Muddy sound, but at least it gives you an idea of what the Softs sounded like when they were touring with Jimi Hendrix."
2,Where's the action?,"I didn't like it. I've read dozens of reviews talking about this being a ""brutal"" ""gritty"" ""exploitation classic"", etc., but it's boring. I'm over here preparing to get blown away but instead I could barely stay awake.Three dorks - one being a female dork - kidnap a ""teenage"" girl and demand her jeweler father to pay them in diamonds. Catch is the father could care less, so to show that they mean business the kidnappers tell him they're going to cut off the girl's ear. Naturally they're too weak stomached to do such a thing so they go to the hospital and pay a guy 50 bucks to cut the ear off a blinking corpse.Things just go on and on like this until the exciting end...exciting cause I could finally turn it off.Two minor topless scenes, including one from a bad angle."
5,A unique life of a successful woman,Still Woman Enough by Loretta Lynn is a wonderful book that captures your attention and keeps your interest while reading about a woman who describes more about her life and mentions more people who played an important part in her life. This is a 'must read' book even if you've read Coal Miner's Daughter. You will not want to put the book down.
4,"""Say Yea"" to this album!","Though they've always been their own eclectic style, Hobex decided to focus on their first loves: funk and soul. This album's sultry, mid-tempo feel is reminiscent of these funk soul roots that Hobex pulls off so well. ""Say Yea"" is a classic horn driven tune that will have the creakiest of knees movin' and ""Ain't Pushin' Baby"" is smooth enough to bring any woman to her knees begging for more. The rest of the album, classic acoustic tunes, is something we as a radio culture do not often hear. I can hear this whole album was made with much care, for Wisteria's lyrics emit the emotions of love. This well crafted album will convince anyone that music does have a purpose: the spread of world peace and love. You should see them live."
3,"good advice, narrow perspective","This book has excellent information about what children at each stage of development are likely to think and feel about the death of someone close to them. However, the suggested ways of dealing with those feelings were somewhat limited, and allowed little flexibility for differing family circumstances. For example, the book is extremely critical of ways religious families may choose to explain death to children, claiming that many religiously based explanations may lead a child to believe the person may be coming back someday. The book also asserts that a closed casket is the ultimate form of denial of the death, and that even young children should attend funerals. Many recommendations, like the three mentioned above, might or might not be right for a family trying to cope with a death. Overall a good resource for understanding a child's possible perceptions, but not so good for determining how to address them."
1,dam this is really late man why you guys are sending stuff late this time.,dam this is really late man why you guys are sending stuff late this time. Is really late but you guys take too much money.
4,FIFA 2007 XBox,"I'm not looking for a whole bunch of intricacies and perfections in my video games; I just needed to have a soccer game in the collection! That said, the graphics are good, the game play is realistic, and it's good game. The introductory menu is a tad confusing to navigate and start into a season, etc., but most of what I will be doing is just friendlies against my buddies, so it should be perfect. Good game, good price."
3,meh,"I have to rate this as ""meh"". I am spoiled, I think, by Winning Eleven, which has far superior gameplay IMHO. I bought FIFA 07 because they have the licenses to have the teams and players I like (DC United and Hapoel Tel Aviv). And while it is fun to play in a 'real' league, the gameplay is just disappointing. Not terrible, just disappointing.--Me"
3,Very Entertaining,I enjoy the game to an extent. I have had a couple of problems playing it but it may just be my particular XBOX system not sure if it is because of the game!! Thanks
3,Doesn't plays on XBOX360!,"Take care when you're going to buy this title, because it doesn't plays on XBOX360 console! If you have XBOX360 console, buy the XBOX360 Fifa Soccer 2007 instead of this one."
5,Diaper Bag Wonderful,"I received this diaper bag along with the mini diaper bag in the Mocha scheme, to match the pack n play and stroller combo I also have. The Diaper Bags are wonderful and I love how the big one comes with a changing pad, so you can change baby anywhere."
3,Christmas in Rome,"This CD contained a wonderful compilation of Christmas music. Although I did find that it was missing the usual Chieftain foot-stomping flair. It was definately an easy listening type CD. If you like to sing along to your Christmas music, this isn't the CD for you. It wasn't what I expected, but it was a great Christmas album no less."
3,Disappointing,"I was really hoping for something special in this CD: something different, well-done, and capturing the best of the season. Different was about all I got. Much of the singing was bad, and one soloist had such a grating voice my husband and I couldn't understand the arrangers' choices. I'll try to give it a listen again and get what I can out of it: I have a feeling this may be one of those CDs where I program out half of the songs every time I listen to it. Very disappointing."
4,Very good little camera.,"I have had this camera for 4 months now and I can not find any thing remotely bad that all the naysayers have writen about. Battery life? I took over 400 pics. with the first battery, this is with 60% flash assisted. To slow? All I can say is read the book. Grandkids are never still and I have had no problems. My experieance has been great. Buy one you will be happy."
5,Great little camera,"My first digital camera. The ONLY downside is the delay between the time you press the shutter release (w/flash) and the actual opening of the shutter, but even that can be handled as you get used to it.The picture quality is magnificent. Using cropping, I've made some 8x10 blow-ups of some pretty small croppings, with great results - very fine detail, NOT grainy, great color, etc.The camera body shape allows you to hang on to the camera easily, while still offering the advantages of a very small camera - even pocket-sized (with moderate to large pockets).With a 256Mb flash card, I get 315 highest pixel pictures. You just keep on clicking. It's great."
1,Battery Problems,"The picture quality, size, weight all are excellent but the biggest problem is with battery consumption. The whole idea of a sleek camera ends when you have to keep a dozen batteries with you all the time.I have used it alot but many times it died when I needed it most. I strongle recommend to look for another product."
4,I warmly recommend this camera,"I got this camera two months ago, and after 2500 pictures taken I can safely say that this is a very good camera, especially for this price.I was actually looking for a smaller camera, as I want to take it with me everywhere I go, but despite it being bigger than the smallest cameras on the market, it fits perfectly in the pocket of my jeans. Also, you get a really good grip when you hold it in your hand, which is also important.The image quality is great; for examples, see peterlindberg.se/photologIf you buy this camera, you should be aware that the batteries take a few, say 4 or 5 charges to function properly. After that, they last two days."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this camera after I accidently killed my Nikon 775. I have to admit to a bit of disappointment. There wasn't much progress made in the camera form factor. It is a relatively large camera. I assumed that there is some sort of trade-off...that this larger camera took better quality pictures than other, smaller, 3.2mpix devices.I've had a terrible time trying to get decent shots. With the 775 I consistently got very nice snapshots. I've owned this camera for about 8 weeks and I'm still struggling to get decent photos. Night shots are almost impossible. Maybe my memory card is too slow, but it takes forever to get setup for the next picture.The redeye feature doesn't work and the shutter lag is too long.I sprung for rechargeable Ni-MH batteries and I'm pretty satisfied with their life, but it took about two weeks before they would really keep a charge."
5,Very COOLpix,"I am amazed at the clarity of the photos. This is not the first digital camera I have had, but it is the best!I love the short movies that I can film, I love the scene assistant.. It is cool all around.Took it camping this past weekend, got some excellant shots of the Mtns, made them look pretty close and clear even though they were far away... Sure I might be able to get a better camera.. but not at this price!"
1,Big waste of money,"Initially we were happy with this camera even though it only shot 20 pics until the NiMH AA rechargeables ran out of juice. But then it dwindled down to about 2-3 pics so we got a CR-V3 Lithium Ion rechargeable which increased it up to 20 pics again - for about 2 months. Then it dwindled back down to 2 pics per charge. In that time, on a trip to BC Canada the camera got stuck in that it wouldn't open its lens but wouldn't shut off either. It got really warm, fried the digital picture memory chip with all our trip pics on it. Then 3 months later, it died altogether. What a waste of money, time, and trip pics which we will never get to see."
3,Nikon 3100,"I bought a Nikon coolpix 3100 after a lot of search through the stores, but I got diasppointed with the performance. First the LCD screen has many dots which is lit all the time. (In the users guide it written that this is normal!!).Second and most disappointing is the optical view finder, if you switch the LCD screen off and try to take some pics, it takes many sec (5-6 sec in my peice) to take the picture, or this function is completely useless. I called the Nikon Tech support and they also checked and agreed this problem. I think it is a basic bug in this new product. So be aware what you are going to have.Good things are it is very compact, quality of the pictures are good."
2,"Keep looking, photo's too dark indoor..waste","Although this camera has outstanding features, such as the ability to edit and crop photo's within the camera itself, I am very disapointed and plan on returning it after just 2 days. Having much experience with digital camera's, indoor shots are much too dark on auto mode. Keep away if you expect good pictures with the auto mode. Also, delay too great in between shots, and very prone to blury exposures. Not too certain why it got such ""good"" evaluation, perhaps because the outdoor shots were much better. I will try the Canon next."
1,not so good buy!!!!!,"when I bought this camera about 3 years ago, it was more like $300 and a year after I bought it, the bottom part of it, the latch that holds the batteries in broke!I tried bringing it back to the store and they could not do a thing------I see that it has been discontinued and I think that is for a very good reason!don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The mini dynamo,"It is an awesome camera for its size, and 14 modes. It's one of the best, if the pictures are taken at day time.But I found the night mode extremely disappointing. When I take pictures in the night mode, they turn out to be very shaky and unclear. Almost all photographs I have taken so far at night turned out to be bad."
2,"Good pictures, but unreliable","We have two Nikon Coolpixs 3100's in the family - both with serious problems. On the plus side, the camera takes good pictures when it works.One has the lens mechanism failure (System Error shows, lens won't retract) and is unusable. The second was dropped, and the catch on the battery door broke. Unfortunately, the catch is part of the body, and so it's uneconomic to service. It's still usable on a tripd! I still use a 40 year old Nikkormat, but these cameras are built to a poor standard."
2,Great quality images.. not so sure about other things though,"I've had this camera for a few months, and I bought it online as a refurbished item. I don't know if this is because it was a refurbished item, or if it's an actual issue with the cameras itself but this camera recently just died. I've tried a couple different batteries, and still no luck. It did this before, but it started working again after I left it alone for about a week.But as others have said, this camera does have GREAT image quality. However, it does take a while to save the image and the autozoom is dreadfully slow. It might be worth the money, I can't really say.. but from my experience, no. The battery life is horrible.I'd say the size of the camera, quality images, and numerous features are the only good things about this camera."
2,Terrible night time and indoor photos!,"This camera takes terrible photographs at night as well as inside. I took about one hundred photos recently at Walt Disney World at night mainly of my children. Only five of the pictures were any good. The night mode focuses to infinity leaving your subject blurry. Without the night mode the flash is so weak it's useless. The red eye reduction takes forever to fire the picture which means your subjects (children) have moved leaving a terrible shot.All the indoor photos proved to be poor also. The camera is just not quick enough to fire. If you have small children and are going to try to photograph them, I would avoid this camera.I gave it two stars because it is easy to use and compact, but that's not why you buy a camera. I returned mine and am looking for a new one."
2,Not What It's Cracked Up It Be.,"This book isn't good for a novice to start learning about black hair care. The is very confusing and a waste of time. In the book, they repeat the same thing over and over, you in up skipping pages, and half of the information you're probably already know how to do. The author of this book does't go in-depth the information they provide. Out of all the Milady's book, this book is the most disappionting and isn't worth your hard earn money."
5,hot stuff!,"I received this cookware as a gift and have been thrilled with it. It is heavy guage, heats evenly, cleans up easily. The set has a versitle assortment of pans sizes - you'l be very happy with it. comparable to Calphalon at a far mor reasonable price."
3,Good wisk,"I wanted to like this whisk more than I do. I have non-stick cookware and needed silicone utensils; this looked perfect. It feels nice in your hand, but the handle is heavy and tips out of the saucepan pretty easy. It looks great, I wish the handle weighed less."
3,"It works, but........","Both myself and a friend purchased the warmer. We have the same issue that the warmer does not stay at the desired setting. As we practice in Minnesota where the winters are long it is an annoyance to have to reset during an active session. Other than that, this product works fine and was value priced."
3,Warm?,"Like the idea of the warmer, it takes a little while for it to work though, I have an electric blanket that gets warmer faster. I just ended up cranking the warmer up and covering the bed up with a blanket to get it warm."
3,The Controls have changed,"I purchased this so called same item over a year ago and love it, was wanting another for my other table. But the item now has digital controls and as a vision impaired MT the good old simple on off high med and low worked best for me. I cannot say how the product itself now compares.. I returned it, but the quality of the fabric didn't seem as good of quality either."
2,"worked well, but no longevity","The warmer was great, but only for a short period of time. Unfortunately the warranty is not long, so after some months passed, the ""High"" setting stopped working. The medium and low heating are pretty minimal in heat, so not really worth keeping it without the high setting."
1,Poor results,This table warmer hardly warmed up. Even on the highest setting the blanket radiated no heat.
2,Need One That Works,"I orderedMaster Massage Massage Table Warmeron July 9, received it quickly and was thrilled until yesterday when it just quit working no matter what I tried. This wasn't even a month let alone a year. Heat settings, and everything else perfect for my needs."
1,had to return this item,I used this item 3 times before it stopped working. I liked the washable element of this product which is the main reason for buying it.
3,Massage Table Warmer could be warmer,"I wish the table warmer would hold it warms longer. Can't seem to feel the heat at times. This product needs tweaking. I'm kinda disappointed with it, but for the price, you get what you pay for :("
1,not so great,I have had nothing but problems with this warmer. It worked great for the first week or so. Since then it turns it self off after only 20-30 minutes. Of course I was stupid enough to throw away all the papers that came with it. I would not recomend this product to another massage therapist.
4,massage table warming pad,"At first, I didn't think the pad got hot enough.Now I really like it. I use for massages as well as body wraps.It has a timer that automatically goes off if you leave the room and forget about it, which is nice not only for safety reasons, but for your electric bill as well."
4,Table Warmer,The table warmer works wonderfully. Keeps the client warm in a room that is more comfortable for me. The timer helps my short term memory and turns off after I am done.
1,Sending back,Set it on high and you can barely notice any warmth at all. Sorry to have to send back but it just doesn't work. I should have spent the extra money and got the higher priced blanket.
5,table warmer that really warms,I have had several massage table warmers and this one is super easy to program and warmer on low than most were on highest settings. I do wish it had a timer to turn itself off. Cord is plenty long and the pad is securely fitted to my massage table. Very satisfied.
2,The diet book was thin,"I hate to give a mediocre grade to the work of someone I liked, but... Cory Everson is/was one of the most awesome women that ever lived; she won more Ms. Olympia trophies for physical perfection in a female than anyone else. An acknowledged athelete in college, she was formidable in any endeavor she entered into. Her TV show was both informative for physical training and entertaining for the discerning male viewer if you liked ""hard body"" women. The book was purchased in the hope that it was either going to be a fantastic illustrated diet cookbook or a poor cookbook with an excess of photos of the author; I could accept either one. There are no galleries of photos of the awesome ms. Everson nor is the cookbook and workout section printed on quality paper, in sixteen or even four colors. It is difficult to use a book, day in day out, that is cheaply printed like this one."
1,worthless,"There's a distinction between an excellent, well written and well organized summary vs. pages of poorly written scribbles. This book can't be used to study for Biochemistry. It has no clinical correlation. It has few diagrams and those in there are black and white and poorly illustrated. The book supposedly included practice question but to access any of those you have to register your book online and you get only 12 months to practice after which the questions you supposedly paid for are wasted. Worthless book. Does not deserve to be included in the Rapid Review series."
2,not great,"I have rapid review pathology which is amazing. This just doesnt compare. Its ok, but not great. It lacks diagrams and is too detailed for step 1. I recommend getting lange biochemistry and genetics flash cards for biochem. They are great, use them with first aid for biochem and you are golden."
2,Didn't want a night light,"I was looking for an easy to read, low light clock radio. This product has a blue light with black numbers which are not easy to see unless you are directly in front of it. The blue back light is much brighter than I wanted and keeps the bedroom lit like a night light. The Insta-Set feature is convenient the radio works well. The button for setting and turning off the alarm is a bit tricky because holding it down too long changes the time from standard setting to military setting. All in all while this is a decent clock radio it didn't meet my expectations."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"The automatic dimmer does not work, the readout is very dim all the time. You have to be right on top of it to be able to read the time. A manual switch with Bright, Medium and Dim settings is needed. As previously stated, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
3,"..i hate to criticize music, but.....","...is this a bad CD? absolutely not. Was I disappointed? Yes. I heard Te Alejabs de Mi on Pandora and loved the song so much that I bought this album. I don't claim to be an expert on Spanish music or Barcelona (I've been once), but other than the song I mentioned, I didn't feel much Spanish influence here. I also wished there had been more vocals. Only one song that I remember has vocals. But even without that, this could have been a better album. I enjoy Thievery, Bent, Bliss, Kuba, The Verbrilli Sound, Kevin Yost, some Gotan Project, Esthero, but out of the 20 or so songs on the discs, I only found one that I really enjoy. The rest are just okay. Not bad by any means, but very neutral (in my opinion). These artists put together a good/decent album, but there wasn't anything that moved me. Maybe you will feel differently? Sorry to criticize someone's work of art."
2,Not Spanish Music,"I'm a fan of music from around the world. Sometimes I want to listen to Irish, sometimes Indian/Bollywood, sometimes Spanish. This is not Spanish. Granted, most of the singing is Spanish, but there is no doubt that most of the songs sound like they're from... Bollywood?Yup, most of the songs are extremely Indian in flavor. I did not get this CD set with the hopes of hearing Spanish sung to Indian beats and with Indian inflections/vocal modulation. But that's what this is. A friend of mine who is a native Spanish speaker even attested some of the vocals, while Spanish, were actually tinged with an Indian accent. Couldn't this collection have had music actually from Spain?If you have hopes for something guitar flavored or merely Spanish in the most stereotypical of senses, steer far from this. The Argentinian and Red Eye Frequent Flyer collections are not bad, however, and true to their titles."
5,"good book, very emotional",I thought it was a good book. It was interesting to hear about what it's like for someone to go though having breast cancer and how their family deals with it.
3,Give me a break!,"Alexandra Parker is battling breast cancer and her husband, Sam, is being a real jerk because he can't deal with her illness. His mother died of cancer and he just can't face the trials and tribulations his wife has to go through to conquer her illness. I don't know what Danielle Steel was thinking when she wrote this book, but the characther of Alexandra should not have taken her husband back after his terrible treatment of her immediately after she was diagnosed. And then he has an affair to boot with a self-centered, social climbing twit. While cancer is very hard on family members, and some spouses cannot cope, I feel that Ms. Steel took this to the extreme... and some of the scenarios just happened much to quickly after Alexandra was diagnosed."
4,"I liked the book a lot, but the ending was disappointing.","Once again a DS heroine is rich, successful, beautiful and loved. When she discovers she has breast cancer her whole world is shattered. Her husband refuses to deal with it on any level so she turns to a co-worker (Brock) who cares a great deal about her. Her husband is not only unsupportive, but has an affair to boot. Everything was so believable until the end, when she went back to her husband. If she didn't have a daughter, would she have chosen differently? Inspite of the ending, I thought the way she handled her cancer and the courage she showed were very believable. I'm sure there's a million women out there that would like to meet Brock."
2,Don't waste your time with this one!,The characters are shallow and the ending is just awful. If you like Danielle Steel read Granny Dan or Zoya instead. They are much much better than this ridiculous farce of a book
2,disappointing,"For the second time in as many months I have read and was disappointed with the characters in a Danielle Steel book. Where does she find them. Sam was so irritating that if he really existed, I would have slapped him. Alex wasn't that much better. She should have sent him packing and kept the kind considerate Brock."
4,a good novel,"I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT NOVEL I LOVE DANIELLE STEELE NOVELS SHE GIVRS YOU GREAT DETAILS IN DESCRIBING THE CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS ITS ALMOST AS IF YOU ARE THERE."
4,keeps your interest,"Good book, keeps your interest, loved seeing the point of view of a cancer victim, very realistic. Some parts of the book regarding the husband made me quite angry!"
4,Lightning,"I liked the book except the ending,I do not think she should have taken Sam back,He did not stand by her when she needed her most instead he went after another woman,The things he said and did to Alex were unforgivable,Sorry doesn't cut it."
1,Very Annoyed!,"I give this book a 1 star not because it wasn't interesting - it certainly was, but because the ending absolutely floored me! Aghgh**&&*(7#!!!!! I never thought it was going to end like that - where was the justice?? I feel like something is missing. I want to reach into the book and smack Alex! Please tell me there is a follow-up book where Sam gets what's coming to him!!! -- Oh, and Daphne too!"
2,Should never have went back to that louse of a spouse.,"The way he treated her, she should never ever had taken him back. He will always be a coward. She should have stayed with the guy she worked with. He cared about her for better or worse. Her marraige vows were a sham"
2,Lightning,"LightningReally thought I would like this book due to the story behind it. Entire book kept me interested until the end. The ending totally ruined it for me to the point I will probably never purchase another book wrote by her. Love or no love, life doesn't work that way. You marry for better or worse and Sam was the worst of the worst!"
2,Depressing and repetitive,"I have read many of Danielle Steel's novels and this is one of my least favorites. This story is about a woman named Alex who is diagnosed with breast cancer. Although she is able to cope with the difficult road ahead of her, her husband of more than 15 years cannot and is at times very cruel to her. I found it hard to believe that they could be so in love before the diagnosis and then he just gives up on their marriage. The ending was extremely disappointing as well. If you are looking for a more worthwhlie Steel novel, try Fine Things, Zoya, Wings, or Silent Honor."
3,Beginning was good..,"The beginning of this book was excellent. Steel shows well how illness affects a persons life. I couldn't even put the book down until after she started ""recovering."" However, the end drags a little. I found myself skimming the last few pages. The book is certainly worth reading, just not one of the best."
1,depressing drivel,"I decided to read this because I usually enjoy Danielle Steele's books. However, I felt that this was just a bit too depressiing and mocks women who have battled cancer. I regret wasting my time reading this. The story seemed too contrived inparts and in some I was actually thinking to myself this is crap! I know a lot of people will disagree with me but I think that she is capable of better writing than this."
1,oh please...,"i thought this was an alright book right until the end. sam is a real jerk, why would she ever go back with him? he'll always be that way, he won't change. she shoulda married brock, he's the real man."
2,I thought the book could have been better.,"Basically, what I did not like about this book was the wife who was battling cancer decided to give her unfaithful husband another chance. This man was not there for her during her kemo therapy sessions or whatever else she went through to survive. Her male friend was always there for her. She should have married him instead of going back to her husband. I was very disappoined by this book. I believe Ms. Steel could have written the plot better than what was published"
5,A must read for anyone who never wants cancer or knows someone with it!,"I read this book as a student, and felt it was one of the most complete cancer books I've found. It's a great set of guidelines to live by - for all of us (who don't want cancer), and is simple and easy to follow. There are very helpful, specific recommendations (some not widely known). The book deals with every level of wellness including attitude, understanding the progression of disease, how to heal from it, and how not to go there in the first place! The approach is both wholistic and medical. I have applied much of what I learned to my entire familiy's daily routine in the past year. I have given copies to friends who are healing from cancer and they also found the information very helpful and practical."
3,i'm a little skeptical,"this book is what all of the positive reviews purport it to be, however - i am somewhat skeptical of any book that has specific product recommendations as to the brands and types of herbal supplements you should buy.often in the book, it will praise a nutrient or vitamin, and then tell you the best source to get it into your body is to buy a certain product and specifically not tell you any recommended dosing information so you really can't implement their advice WITHOUT those aforementioned products."
2,Rickety Bird Stand,"This Bird Stand looks good in the picture, but in reality, it turned over at least three times before our Blue & Gold Macaw became used to how far he could lean. While the original purpose was to allow him to enjoy different areas of the house with us without leaving droppings on the floor, he still does. He climbs on top of the feed cups which allows his rump to hang over the floor below. The feed cups should have been moved further in or the tray made a little larger. Don't know what could have been done to make the stand more stable. It is functional, but not reliable."
3,My bird likes it!,"Although this isn't the sturdiest of products and is a little lower than my parrot would like (he prefers tall perches), it's a good stand for the money."
4,Bird Perch,The perch is very well constructed and stable design. The only change that I would suggest is for a better way to remove the water container. Unscrewing the container makes it difficult to avoid spills and over time the thread could wear.
3,not for large birds,I found this item to tip easily. This is not made for a large bird (amazon macaw). If my bird sits still things are alright. He has tipped it more than once. So I have to make sure that I weigh it down so it doesn't tip. I like it becasue it is mobile.
2,Very disappointed.,I was very disappointed with this purchase as the product turned out lopsided and crooked after it was put together.
3,Not the CD that I thought,"Tamia: Between Friends was not the CD that I intended to buying, I was actually looking for another one of her songs; however, in the process of me listening to the entire CD I realized that it is still a very good CD. I wouldn't say I'm a Tamia fan, but I can definitly say that she is way under exposed, this CD is great, there are quite a few tracks that I like and if I ever find the CD that has the orginal song I was looking for...I'll be a happy camper."
4,Really Good...,"Though this is not her latest project, it is very enjoyable to listen to.Her voice and Chante Moore's voice remind me of each other. Just reallycalming, nice to listen to project.Ms Tamia doesn't seem to get the attention and accolades in the music business thatI think she deserves. But this is a project that I think folks should pay attentionto or at the very least make you pay attentionto the angelic voice of Tamia.You'll enjoy listening to this one."
3,A CD that blends all of the songs together...,"I bought this CD yesterday and have listened to it about twice. The standout tracks to me were ""Almost"" and ""Sitting On the Job"". The rest of the album does a good job of just blending the songs together without any real classics. I wouldn't totally recommend it but it's not a terrible CD. If you like Tamia maybe you would like it. But to me, she didn't belt enough of the songs out. But it wasn't like how Toni Braxton whispers on a track...nothing like that. It's just that she didn't really make you feel a song except for maybe one that I can't think of at the moment.Final Grade: 3 1/2 stars.The CD gets three stars and the half star comes from the DVD that comes with the CD. It talks a bit about the album and has Tamia in the studio."
3,It's ok,"I can't give an in depth review of the CD because I've only listened to it once, but on first listen there wasn't much that appealed to me. I love When A Woman, and like Have To Go Through It, but this wasn't as good as her 1st and 2nd CDs. I can't comment on the 3rd CD because I only played it once...the first two stayed in heavy rotation.Anyhow, I love Tamia's voice. I feel she's being overlooked, but I'm not sure she can keep anyones attention if she keeps releasing CDs like Between Friends. I gave this CD 3 stars because I like Tamia, but to like 2/14 songs (I haven't listened to the last two songs yet) is terrible.I almost hate I bought the CD. I'll give it another shot. Maybe something will sound better when i listen again."
2,Between Thoughts?,"While I love Tamia's voice and melodic flows, it still leaves me quite confused as to why she works with the same old producers who really don't showcase her gift in the best of lights...Tamia is one of my favourite artists but something about her production, gets me everytime and its really upsetting! On this album, maybe 4 of 14 songs stand out, although at this point I could only recall one if my life depended on it! I think the main things lacking in the this album is that most of the songs are filler material and don't grab attention at all. I feel as though the producers give her the work other artists declined. Tamia had the look and the voice...whats missing to get her on top?"
2,tamia between friends,"I love Tamia but this cd was a disappointment, I like maybe 2 tracks from the entire cd."
2,THE ONLY REASON,"The only reason I gave it two stars is because if you are looking for a hot r&b artist, you might want to check out Ciara's New album ""The Evolution"" first then buy this."
4,Tamia: Between Friend,This is a great album and it has been delivered in a very classy style. The songs were meaningful and premitted your imagination to go where you wanted it to go. Tamia did a good job on the Aretha Franklin re-make. The integrity was there.
4,R&B is back,"This is by far one of the best R&B; CDS on the market, Tamia comes back with a very grown & sexy vibe to life and love....My favorite song on the album is ""ME"" believe me if you have some friends or you are going through some things with your partner, and are being mistreated this song is for you!I was kind of upset that they don't promote the right artist correctly.....This CD should be hitting the billboards besides the fake R&B;KooDoos to Tamia and Good Luck!Keep it Coming!"
5,Welcome Back Tamia,"Tamia's Between Freinds at first listen takes me back to her first to cd. That was while listen to them at work. Once i got home relaxed and gave it my full attention i found so much more. Man or woman if you have ever been hurt in a relationship you will feel it. This Young lady takes you thru. When i heard Me ... i had to go get my wine cause it was going to be a long night. The stand out to me are ME, WHEN A WOMAN , PLEASE PROTECT MY HEART, ALMOST ( DOWN SOUTH JAM ), LAST FIRST KISS AND LOVE & I.This was a great buy 5 stars..... much better then the last effort More... here she has more control over the over all product."
2,its ok,Beats are too similar to everyone else that wants to make a record; no unique sound or style. Nothing great.
4,Great Album!,"Imazing voice and beatiful caribean melodies, love this album, so far I had bought each one of her albums but this one is absolutly the best."
4,The most underrated female R&B singer,"How fitting for Tamia to release this cd on an independent label, yet continue to work with producers and songwriters who helped her achieve the level of success she has had? From start to finish, this cd is not only lyrically impressive, but crafted to deliver to the listener joy in the almost 50 minutes it takes to complete listening. With 4 Grammy nominations under her belt (all before the release of her debut cd mind you), stellar vocals, and a great ear for bringing the listener into her world, I support Tamia wholeheartedly. One reason alone: Her stellar version of ""Daydreaming"", that made me not wish to hear Aretha sing it again. How many other female singers can do that? I defy you to name one."
5,She still has that sweet charm,"When I first bought the CD I thought it was going to be just good but the more I listen to it the more I feel that Tamia has grown to be a star. After watching her in some talk shows I noticed she has one of the best live voices in music nowadays.I recommend this CD, especially the songs: Me, Love and I, Can't get enough, Too Grown, The Way I Love You and Almost.Through her new album ""Between Friends"", Tamia and Shep Crawford (producer) offer strong lyrics with the voice of an angel."
3,Not half bad,Tamia never got the proper attention she desvered but she's still a good singer. The CD features the big single Can't Get Enoungh and a cover of Daydreaming. If you get a chance pick this one up and give it a listen.
4,replacement,It arrived timey & works fine-for my Braun Razor. If you need 1 -buy it. If you have another brand razor-odds are-it won't.
5,These Hands is Empowering to little hands,"This book is wonderful for emerging readers & for those children just learning to appreciate symbols of inspiration & empowerment. Children all want to do for themselves & Hope Price's book lets all children know that they can do so many, wonderful & helpful things. The poetry is simple & easy for all to grasp. The illustrations are beautiful. I think that this ""big little book"" will spark the imagination of children & hopefully get them thinking about the many ways they can contribute to their family, friends & society. My kids loved it. We look forward to more stories from Hope."
2,Guitarist,"For those who don't know, Ed King who plays guitar was later an orginal member of Lynyrd Skynyrd..FREEEEBIRRDD"
3,IT WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR,"Ok, so its not great, but it was a very good year for all thehippy trippy lyrics and paisley shirts and the commercial alternative was so much better. Still, its a fun album and needs to be put down, man!!!"
1,"Psych Lite, indeed!","Do yourself a favor, spend the money on Love's ""Forever Changes""... If you like wack stuff like HP Lovecraft, then this might be a treat, but I have two words for you... THE CREATION!"
2,Ipods & DVD's,"Man this thing sounds as dated as dated can sound, it even surpasses ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"". Lets face facts though, the title track is the only reason this thing was even put out on CD and not left to rot in a record comapanys vault somewhere. And what about that title track---well it too unfortunately is dated however there is and always has been and undeniable charm with that song. Overall this stuff is better left alone and if your so inclined you can find the title track elsewear without all the hippy dippy trippy mumbo jumbo smiley face crap."
3,Excellent for driving your co-workers insane.,"A beautiful example of the Salad Days (Daze?), although one can't help but feel ironically depressed."
2,It could be Better,"The songs on th cd are great. It is a classic psychedelic band. However, the liner notes inside the inner booklet were very disappointing. There were no other pictures or song information. All that was in there was a list of other cds and dvds made by Priceless Collection. I bought the cd of Strawberry Alarm Clock, not of a list of other items. Disappointing!"
3,Not bad,"The Strawberry Alarm Clock's hit ""Incense and Peppermints"" is without a doubt one of the defining songs of the 60s ""peace, love and hypnotics"" counterculture. And it still holds up not only as an artifact but as a solid rock number. Unfortunately, it's the only truly ""solid"" piece the Strawberry Alarm Clock can be credited with as their album appears to be simply a vehicle for their one and only hit.It's not that the album is below average. By no means. Its just that among some of the outstanding albums released during the era, Incense and Peppermints lacks originality.If you're just looking for the hits without the filler, check out the Nuggets boxed sets"
2,Psychedelic Lite,"Only a few remanents of their earlier, garagier incarnation-- Thee Sixpence-- remain on this artifact from the Age of Aquarius. Unfortunately, most of this disc sounds like the ""sha la la"" coda of the title track, rather than the harder garage psych embodied in the song's main structure. Although it has its moments, ""Good Morning Starshine"" is a notable example of the type of frilly rock most often featured on this disc. More akin to The Left Banke (without the songwriting) than other bands with similarly enticing names-- Chocolate Watchband, Third Bardo, Blues Magoos etc. Advised only for those who wear their love beads and face paint without shame. Lame."
1,This is not the old vinyl,"I have not purchased any CD titled ""Incense and Peppermints"" including this one as none have ever included all of the songs of the original vinyl album (which I still have from 1967).Side 11. The World's On Fire2. Birds In My Tree3. Lose To Love4. Strawberries Mean LoveSide 21. Rainy Day Mushroom Pillow2. Paxton's Back Street Carnival3. Hummin' Happy4. Pass The Time With Sac5. Incense And Peppermints6. Unwind The ClocksWhenever someone releases a CD from the original album I will purchase it."
3,"If you are getting high, you might be amused by this album","The Strawberry Alarm Clock needs to be listened to under the influence of drugs to be appreciated. One may find their canned psychedelic sound trite, but try listening to them after ten or twelve bong hits of some serious buds and they are much more than a leftover novelty. This is not consciousness expanding music here, it is not even necessarily good music, but it is definitely something that will hold your interest for a couple of songs if you are super baked."
3,riot67 is clueless.,"yes these songs do sound a bit dated, but guess what? they're from the 60's...wow, imagine it sounding like the 60's. it's not all hippy stuff and even if it is its still better than hip hop and todays pop crap. oh, and 80's new wave is a lot better than hip hop and modern pop as well. cheers."
5,Strawberry Alarm Clock - Incense and Peppermints,"This 2011 limited-edition release from Sundazed Records is a reissue of The Strawberry Alarm Clock’s 1967-debut album “Incense and Peppermints.” The disc has been mastered from the original tapes and is immaculately repackaged as a DigiPak tri-fold case that features the original album artwork, new liner notes and a plastic tray that holds the CD disc, which is printed with the authentic UNI Records label.Strawberry Alarm Clock was a psychedelic rock band best known for their 1967 hit song “Incense and Peppermints”. However, the compositions on this CD reveal that Strawberry Alarm Clock had more going for them then their illustrious hit song. This CD is bursting with well-crafted psychedelic rock songs that have catchy melodies, intricate vocals, elaborate studio effects, exotic instrumentation and jazz improvisation. This album is a forgotten gem and is one of the finest examples of progressive psychedelic rock from the 1960’s."
5,Part of the 60's- Gotta have it! Psychedelic Rock excellence.,This group was definitely underrated by far and hearing this cd and songs after all these years is a testament to the quality of writing and musicianship there was for so many groups of the day...
5,Good Memories,It sounds great and the days of my past came back to me. I remembered sitting in a cloud of smoke listening with friends. We heeded every word. I believe everyone from the 60's should buy this. Relive your past unless it really stunk.
1,"One hit, and that's it","I have to agree with the previous reviewer. I got this on an impulse buy at a music store. It's not really even worth the $... I still love the song ""Incense & Peppermints,"" but then the rest of the album sounds like The SAC checked out of the studio, and the Tradewinds and Sandpipers checked in to finish the album for them. Pure easy-listening fluff. They even cover ""Good Morning Starshine,"" for crying out loud. ""Sabba sibby sabba, nooby abba nabba"" indeed.Casual fans of the hit ""Incense & Peppermints"" might also wonder what happened to the edgy vocalist on that song, who seems to be AWOL on the rest of the album. Well, in fact, he IS gone. He was Greg Munford, who was a 16-year-old friend of the band that sang the lead vocals on that hit. He is not evident on the rest of the album.The one-hit-wonder status of this band is preserved here. You will unearth no hidden gems in the other tracks on this album."
1,Don't bother!!,"I'd have given this NEGATIVE stars if I could have!I find it a bit ironic that the only positive review for this film just happened to originate from the town the star's (Tom Guiry) parents reside. I believe mom... had something to do with it!!This movie was so bad it was never even released at the theaters! The only reason to see it would be to laugh at some of the worst acting I've ever seen. This film was made in Florida and all I could think of while watching it was, ""They could have been at Disney World enjoying themselves rather than wasting their time on this""...."
5,My Aunt Evelyn,Evelyn Scott was my Aunt. I wouldn't part with my Fourteen Bears books for any amount of money. I also love the Story of the Fourteen Bears. (My cousins and I ARE the Fourteen Bears.) I'm glad you all love the books as much as I do.
5,Fourteen Bears in Summer and Winter,"This was one of my favorite childhood books! It would be great if there was a reprint so that I could enjoy reading this to my children. Each time we read the story, my sister and I would choose which bear we would be for that reading. We loved it!"
5,Childhood memories,"When my daughter was young, we'd go to the public library every week for story hour and to check out stacks of books. 14 Bears Summer and Winter was her absolute favorite. We checked it out every other week and read it at least once a day (or twice, three times or more!) This charming story kept her enthralled. Before she could read, she could finish the appropriate passages with the phrase ""and little Theodore."" We spent many hours with this well loved story, which was a major accomplishment for my VERY active young child!"
5,Fourteen bears summer and winter,I am a person who buys a book because of the illustrations and the creative contenet. I fell in love with this book when I was four and I have been able to get a copy so that my children can read it. I have to hide my copy so that they can only see it during very special moments. I would love a copy that they can pour over and dream about. I also want to buy a copy for neices and nephews who may not be lucky enough to have the book that their father loved so much also. I would love to see it reprinted. But they need to print a lot so we can all get the amounts we need! Thanks.
5,Random House Considering Reprint!!,Random House responded to my email inquiry stating that they are currently considering bringing this book back into print. They will be more likely to decide favorably if they receive more requests for it. I urge everyone who would like to see this classic in reprint to send them a letter or email today.
5,The most memorable and enchanting book I read as a child!,"How I loved this book as a child! It had such beautiful and detailed pictures. Not only did it take you through the wonderful story written on it's pages, but you could dream for hours of other stories the bears must have lived through! For the longest time, I couldn't remember the name of this wonderful book, and now I find that it is out of print. What a tragedy! All children (young and old) should be able to transport themselves through these pages into the bear's wonderful homes. I had so hoped I could find this book to share with my daughter! I just hope the publisher will realize what a classic this book is and republish it."
5,Childhood classic!,My mother and I have been searching for years for this book. It is one of my all time favorites. We don't know what happened to our original copy and have been trying to find one forever! I loved reading other peoples' reviews and was delighted to find that they also were looking for it and loved it too!
5,PLEASE reprint these books!,"I am thirty also, and this is my favorite book from my childhood. I used to look at it for hours. I left my childhood home under tragic conditions and this book was lost to me. I have been looking for years and am so touched to see how many others are looking too. The author should be so proud and the publisher ashamed for not getting this book in the hands of a new generation!"
5,Bring back the Fourteen Bears!,This is my absolute most favorite book - I must have a copy to read to my children so they can enjoy it as I did as a child. Please find out if the publisher can begin publishing it again!
4,The children's book I remember the most,"I am now thirty, and this is the children's book that I remember the most. I am sad to see it out-of-print, but I will be sure to try and acquire a used copy when I have children. I remember the beautiful illustrations more than I remember the text, and thought it was great to see the youngest bears age between summer and winter."
3,Doobies Lite,"I like both incarnations of the Doobies, the original line-up and the Michael McDonald line-up. This is almost a big band Doobies, or the Doobies Play Vegas. The musicianship is fine, but none of these versions are anywhere near as good as the originals. I would rather hear a live album from the 70's before they had McDonald. These guys can still play and sing, don't get me wrong. One other note: The cd cover says this release includes ""Takin' It To The Streets"", which it does not--the DVD does. Very homogenized release, even my favorite Doobie tune ""Jesus Is Just Alright"" didn't rock. Not a bad cd by any means, but not one track stands out to my ears."
3,Plodding and tricky,"It's hard to believe that Kid Koala accomplishes a lot of what he does on this record using only a set of record players. Tracks like ""Drunk Trumpet"" seem to employ a plethora of production tricks but are so simple and organic that they really work. From a DJ's standpoint that is.From the average Joe's standpoint, this album can often come across as plodding and tricky to listen to. The genius of ""Drunk Trumpet"" comes across more like the sound of someone strangling a bee half the time.What annoys me personally about this CD though is the multitude of vocal samples. I don't need Pac-Man instructions and other such obscure vocal samples as much as I hoped to hear a nice big fat beat with lots of bass every once in a while. And maybe a melody or two. Possibly a treat for DJs to listen to, but most other listeners might be hoping for a bit musicality instead of just fancy turntable tricks."
5,"AWESOME, must have!",This is an awesome CD for a not well known band. I hope it become well known sure because I think people would really catch onto it. It is a great laugh aswell as great music. These people are defiantly smart and know what they are doing and making it fun and enjoyable while they are at it. This is a defiante must have!
3,Kid's got talent,"Kid Koala's new album is good, but a bit slow for me. Kid opens it up with some excellent examples of his talent and beat making skillz. The album goes on and doesn't impress me as much as I thought it would, but i do know that Kid Koalas talent will blossom and he will soon be one of the premier Dj's to stick around in the future."
5,Smile,"This is a strange non-linear comic book with a free record of beats, samples and scrathes performed by a man and seven record decks. It's groovy happy fun and I like it a lot - because it's good, that's why. I mean, really, there's no point faffing around writing about the 'Ninja Tune aesthetic', this is a great fun record that you can play loudly whilst driving around / sitting in the bath / eating sausage rolls. It has lots of funny voice, and mellow bits. The funny voices are funny and the mellow bits are mellow.The box is made of cardboard."
2,Too Abstract to be Enjoyable,"I bought this CD because I loved Koala's work on Deltron 3030. His DJing skills impressed me over everything on that album and so I thought this DJ CD would be similar to the awesome stuff on there and I decided to buy it. However, all that 90% of this CD is, is abstract sounds and sound clips. Most of the tracks lack rhythem/melody. It's trying so hard to be different but lacks almost the whole musical aspect. Download the full songs and you'll see what I mean. The only track I can say that was kick ... on this CD would be, ""Roboshuffle"" and if the whole album had that type of a feel, it would be a lot better and I'd probably end up giving it a 3 star rating, but unfortunatly the CD is nothing like that for the most part. If you're thinking about buying this, download the tracks and think it through again because I would say it's very likely that you'll think this is a pretty stale album like I did."
2,Is Ninja Tune Dist. run by smoking monkeys?,"The CD says Kid Koala/Carpal Tunnel on it. The booklet is right also. But I play this disc, and it's not Koala. It's some chick rapping over breaks with lots of big band samples. Wtf.I mean, it's not bad. Maybe I'll keep it. But, you know, I'd like the album I chose too....Thought you might want to know, ye prospective buyer."
1,Too generic to be any good,"Listening to Kid Koala's train wreck of a CD ""Carpal Tunnel Syndrome"" made me long for mixmasters that know what they're doing like Dan the Automator.I have nothing against abstract interpretations but all Kid Koala does is play spoken tracks against plodding beats. The only extra element added in is scratching, which he uses ad nauseam. Hearing chickens squawking with a bit of turntable scratching is not my idea of music.Because the tracks run together, you can't distinguish between them and they all sound generic besides. It just sounds like they happened to record a kid messing around on a mixing board.Take my advice and stay far away from this CD."
2,are these people crazy? 5 stars? No way.,"this is at best an average cd. reminds me a bit of james taylor style but not the originality of taylor. if you insist to get this cd, make sure you buy it at deep discount. otherwise, don't waste your time/money."
4,mi primera cancion,necesito la versión de primera canción en concierto con paco de lucia y presuntos implicados en donde hace solo de voz soledad junto a alejandro sanz--alguien puede informarme como puedo hacer para comprar éste producto en lo posible en video vhs-pal?
2,Returned,Too narrow! Very heavy sole with little give making heal of foot rise out of back of shoe. I returned for credit. I should know that buying shoes on line is a shot in the dark unless I'm familiar with the shoe brand and how they fit my feet.
5,Pure Jazz Funk,"I heard ""Yada Yada"" and liked it so much that I decided to take a chance on the album. It's very difficult to go wrong with something that boasts a concious hip-hop flavor. I am very impressed. If you like funk bass lines and strong instumentation in your jazz this is a ""Gotta Have""! This is jazz (year) 3030."
4,This man knows music!,"As an On-Air Personality on FM radio covering NYC in 1993, I had the pleasure in meeting and working with Brian Jackson. His mini EP released at that time entitled Will There Be?, is the best album I have ever heard. All six tracks are awesome. It was unfortunate ""The Nex Thing"" which was the name of his group then didn't get the exposure deserved but he blessed Gotta Play with the track Deee-lushuss which was my ""1993 Swazzy Monday Hot Pick of the Year"". I still have your plaque Brian and wanted to let you know, you haven't missed a beat. PS - I was impressed with Parellel Lean too...."
4,Nice to have Stick back,"Skip right to track nine, Parallel Lean/Home Is Where the Hatred Is which features Gil Scott Heron. It works on many many levels, knowing Gil's demons, knowing their history, and (as Jackson writes in the liner notes) that Brian was out of touch with his parents till only a few years ago. In the 1974 version they were social advocates putting voice to and decrying the weakness of others. In this rendition, in the only song where Brian Jackson does lead vocals-- its about the professional and personal homes to which both he and Gil are struggle to reconcile themselves. There is a real sadness to it, as the prophets themselves have come to endure and suffer the pain. The other tracks eschew messages to deliver funky smooth jazz in a tight, very accomplished, very listenable package that brings Brian Jackson back on the scene with a flourish."
1,Decepcionado,"Estuve muy decepcionado cuando me enterre que no tenia la cancion original. Cortan muchas partes y no tocan la cancion ""rosa salvaje"" Arrepiento haber gastado dinero en esta porqueria edicion. La novela es muy bonita pero quitan muchas partes importantes. No gasten dinero en esta edicion."
3,Missing lots of scenes,I found that it is missing alot of scenes. I was watching then it would go to another scene cutting out lots of scenes i saw on tv.
1,Im not happy w/ my DVD,"I bought this just a couple of days ago,This novela was one of the best when it came out but this particular DVD is horrible. The original opening song is non existent and the background music originally used has been changed."
2,For Stars Only - Sarcastic and Poor Plot,"I totally disagree that ""Stage Door"" is the best of releases. Just because it has a team of stars (sarcastic and poorly represented), does not make it a best. I feel the casting was just for the names - little thought of content. ""Stage Door Canteen"" is, by far, the better choice. It is filled with stars, entertainment and plot, as well as music and politics of the time. Whether you agree with the politics and war alliances, there could be no better representation of the age. I thoroughly enjoy revisiting that film. I immediately sold ""Stage Door"" after watching it ..."
4,Wonderful Women!,"Fast snappy dialogue and a window into another world oddly like our own. Imagine a movie with lots of high powered female characters, none of whom have had surgery to their faces to adhere to some imposed idea of beauty as conformity, who, as characters, are competing for success based on personal merit and individuality? Watch this film and show it to young people.JJP"
1,Very frustrating toy for my 3 yr. old,"My 3 yr. old son is a HUGE Blue's Clues fan so when I saw this, I picked it up for him. I'm sorry I did. I though it would be like his Handy Dandy notebooks in a Etcha-Sketch-sort-of-way. Boy, was I wrong. First, the child has to open the box with a key that doesn't quite fit, making it impossible to open. (Mommy broke a nail opening it)Once inside the box, the tracing papers just fell out, so it didn't work.Not a great product. I wish I didn't buy it because I had to make it ""disappear"" since it was so frustrating to my child."
2,This episode gets a C grade and is ranked 58th out of 80,"Responding to a hail from deep within an ancient, unpopulated world, Kirk takes the risk and beams into a chamber where ancient life essences have been preserved. Using the captain's body as a temporary host, the leader Sargon explains how only a few survivors of a massively destructive war were so preserved, including his mate Thalassa and the rebels' leader, Henoch. Kirk agrees to loan them host bodies long enough to build permanent android shells for themselves in return for their shared knowledge, but Henoch -- ensconced in Spock's body -- has other ideas."
3,Interesting overview... but reads like a dissertation...,"Author Marsha E. Ackerman's book, ""Cool Comfort- America's Romance with Air-Conditioning,"" is a fasicinating overview of Americans desire to be cool and comfortable vs. those who say that sealing up a house is ""unhealthy"". Although Ackerman doesn't delve into any technological aspects of air-conditioning (such as the development of centrifugal chillers to the modern compressors of today), she does delve into the psyche of Americans and their views-- both pro and con-- about Air-Conditioning. My only ""gripe"" is that Ackerman's book, which started out as her PhD dissertation that she revised, still reads as a ""stilted"" dissertation. The book tends to keep the reader at ""arm's length"" rather than to allow the reader to ""cozy up"" to the subject."
2,Partial view,I agree with the reviewers who point out that this book is more of a tract against air conditioning than a reasoned analysis and history. There are many interesting small sections but overall the author's anti-air conditioning bias limits the book.
1,Not Bright,"First I was happy when I found out that I got two LED's instead of one. When I first fitted into place of wedge bulb, it fitted in except for little gap, but that wasn't a problem. The big shock is when I turned them on, it was extremely very week. So, I have thrown away and installed a 360 LED bulb."
5,Need energy?,"This product has made a HUGE difference in my energy levels. Not many manufacturers sell this vitamin dose. Also, it's well absorbed."
1,Khornerstone KpM,This DVD is not worth the money I paid for it. The picture is of very poor quality - you can barely see the stallion.
5,An excellent introduction to this African pop superstar,"A fine, representative collection of this Senegalese superstar's work from 1988-94. The opening tracks are gorgeous -- loping, sensuous jams with the classic West African guitar sound of the 1970s, and even a few dips into the Afro-Pop sound of Fela Kuti. The second half of this disc, though, lingers on lush, overwrought pop production styles that I personally find kind of a turn-off, but other world music fans may adore. For an even-handed look at his Maal's early career, this is a very good introduction. The liner notes can also help steer you towards individual albums that may be to your liking."
4,A Little Disappointed,"I have always enjoyed Petula Clark since her introduction into the States with ""Downtown"". ""Don't Sleep In The Subway"" is my all time favorite. Neither are included in this concert. About 40% of the music is more of an MTV video musical rather than an actual concert. If that is the way the ""Concert"" was actually aired on the BBC New Year's Eve I think that should have been mentioned.I would give less than 4 stars except that the actual portions of the concert are so brilliant that I can't.If you want to see Petula at her best live, even if it is a brief glimpse, this has some great moments.Someday I hope someone will release the entire concert. If they do I'll buy it."
2,NOT A New Year's Eve To Remember,"This DVD should really come with a warning that it contains a lot of extremely infuriating and totally irrelevant voiceover. The concert is left behind as Petula is seen wandering around Chichester and its cathedral. The audience seemed very subdued, maybe because of the lacklustre arrangements given to some of the songs. However, Petula is in fine voice, but this DVD is only for die-hard fans, and my copy will, sadly, now be gathering dust."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"While the song selection is pretty good, the sound quality is terrible!Very muddy and distorted. It really detracts from their unique, sweet voices. In fact, the sound quality is so bad in my opinion, not only do I feel taken on the price, but that the sound quality is better on Youtube! What a cheap, poorly executed copy of recordings.Buyer beware."
4,Some good stuff on here Greg Mark,"Well those hot Paris sisters relly sizzle here.The last track is a STEREO remix of ""I love how you love me"".It has a wierd noise reduction problem that happens when you use too muchbut still worth the price of admission.""Now that we're through with love"" ls a cool song and they even do a rockabilly type tune on here with a guitar that sounds twangy like ""on broadway"" if you know what I mean.(harvey)Happy listnin' E.Michael BrydalskiRemember Lana Clarkson who can't defend herself Harvey."
5,Beautiful Chest,We ordered this for our daughter as a hope chest for Christmas. We loved it and so does she. It is beautifully made and sturdy. We liked it also because it has a shelf. The cedar smell inside smells so good. It will be something that will be handed down generation to generation.
2,Spacing for DVD's is too tight,"I bought this cabinet and I'm somewhat dissatisfied.The assembly is not complicated, it uses bolts with cam locks.PRO's: Finish, color, enclosed to keep dust out.CON's: poor door hinge design; it's too small and spacing for DVD's is very restrictive.The doors do not close evenly and make contact with the shelving.DVD space is lost because of the top door magnets.Summary: nice looks but lack of spacing between DVD/shelves and doors causes problems with proper clsosing. Everything is very tightly packed."
1,Not great,"I purchased this to sit next to my 52 inch LCD entertainment system. It looks very sharp. No complaints there. The design is very poor. The door won't shut all of the way because the hinge is not set in the correct place. When the doors are shut, there is a gap between them. The shelving arrangement is complicated because in the center of the back wall there is a support beam that doesn't allow the doors to shut if DVD's sit on that shelf. I have worked around it by repositioning the shelves but it is a pain."
2,POOR QUALITY,"I'm very disappointed in this unit. The construction is beyond poor! There are supposed to be holes in the top of the side panels to insert screws that will attach to the top panel. On one of the sides the holes were not completely drilled out. Also, the side panels are warped. The hinges for the door panels were not inset and the doors don't line up nor will they close all the way. It's a good thing my husband is handy. He had to drill out the holes in the top of the side panel and he is also modifying the hinges so the doors will line up and close properly. Now I notice from some of the other reviews that shelf space is compromised by the poor design of this cabinet. We haven't even gotten to the point of putting DVD's in this thing. We're still trying to put it together as a usable cabinet! I wish I would have read all of the reviews before I decided to buy this. I would NOT recommend this DVD cabinet to anyone."
1,Disappointed,I was very unhappy to assemble the product. The tools given were inadequate.Some of the tools did not fit.The fixtures did not fit properly.On the whole it has been very disappointing.It will be very difficult for me to return!!!Otherwise I feel that this purchase is worthless.
3,dvd cabinet,"I was looking online for a dvd cabinet and I stumbled upon this.. I bought it because I was like wow this is an amazing cabinet and look's nice.. BUT I received it and put it together and it is very small.. like a miniature cabinet.... so be aware to look at measurement's before buying.. It is a sturdy cabinet and we still have it after a year so it has held up very well, just the size is the down fall for this item.."
4,DVD Cabinet,"This turned out to be a really nice DVD Cabinet. It looks great in the living room and holds several movies. I was almost able to consolidate two DVD racks. The cabinet arrived with a bend hinge which causes one of the doors to need a little extra nudge to close completely. Overall, I like it."
2,Glass Doors are Pretty But Hard to Install,"I bought this storage cabinet last fall, and since I have purchased many do-it-yourself economy furniture items, I thought this would be a cinch. Boy, was I wrong. Everything went fine until I tried to put on the doors. The hinge screws supplied stripped upon screwing them in, and would not screw all the way in - several broke in two! I was tempted to bring the entire unit back, but decided to drill larger pilot holes myself and buy slightly larger and more sturdy screws. This worked, and everything looks fine, but it was an unnecessary hassle. For this reason, I would only purchase this unit if you have handy-man/woman skills. Perhaps my doors were an anomaly, but it caused me to not purchase a second unit.It looks really nice now that I have it all together, and the doors operate just fine, but it never should have taken as long as it did to put this thing together. I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this item to others.konedog"
3,More detailed description,The product purchased was smaller then I was expecting..To include the deminsions in the discription would have been helpful.Had I know the size of it I would not have purchased it.
2,Not as great as it looks in the picture,"Despite instructions, (and skill and experience in assembling everything from cars to cabinets) the doors on this don't hang quite right, for the money, this small cabinet is not Hi Quality."
4,CD/DVD Cabinet,"We are very pleased with this cabinet, tho' it does not hold as much as we had anticipated. It went together without anyproblems. The one thing I don't like is the top shelf, it does not have enough space for CD's to be in an uprightposition, you have to lay them down. We have it in our living room and it looks very nice.Lover of Classical Music"
3,"May work for you, but be warned...","Likes: Finish. Size is great for our apartment. Holds a decent number of DVDs.Dislikes: As mentioned by others. Middle shelf with brace makes a tight fit. Work around it by laying some DVD's down until it reaches brace and stand some on the ends and see if the doors can shut. The top part with the magnets doesn't allow DVD's in the middle. Work around this also by laying DVDs flat until it reaches near the top and you can still get them out.Overall: If you can live with the above work arounds it can still work good and hold a good amount of DVD's. If you feel you are being cheated and shouldn't have to deal with that, don't get this. If I knew what I know now I probably would have looked into another option. Though having said that and since I already have one I might get another some day if we need the room because then they will match and can put one on both sides of our TV stand."
2,Too expensive for what it is,"Too short, not enough room in it. I would definitely go with a different version if it wasn't such a PITA to return this to amazon"
