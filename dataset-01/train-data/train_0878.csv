1,"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices",Please check the following product All About Cells & Body Systems (2001) from schlessinger Studio.The same product in different names and in multiple prices.
4,"I play a lot of sports, and this ...","I play a lot of sports, and this came in very handy when one of my teammates came down with an injury to his ankle. It kept the swelling down until he could get to the emergency room. I'm going to buy a few of these."
4,This product would be good to keep in ...,This product would be good to keep in the first aid kit for the car or for camping trips. It gets cold very fast and lasts for a couple hours.
5,"My mom hurt her shoulder over the weekend, ...","My mom hurt her shoulder over the weekend, and the Ace Instant Cold Compress was a great help. It was instantly cold and provided some much-needed relief to her aching area. I'd definitely use this product again -- it was fast and simple to use!"
4,An excellent starting out video,"I obtained this video free of charge from a friend who had gone through the Jenny Craig program. I had been away from exercise for a while and was just getting back into weight training and step aerobics when I did this tape. It is an excellent introduction to weight training for someone who is out of shape or has not exercised in a long time, although I quickly progressed beyond this level. I did enjoy the tape, though, and the instructor, named Kim, is excellent and offers tips on proper form and technique throughout the tape. Of course, you will have to endure the Jenny Craig ""success stories"" and subtle advertising for the Jenny Craig program that are interspersed throughout the tape, but I suppose that can be motivating for some people.If you are new to exercise, I would recommend this one, as well as the other two tapes in the series, they will get you pointed in the right direction!"
4,Quality product,Great product at a great price really impressed with how quick it got to me and the quality of the rod is brillant. Will buy another one when I shop for rods again.
5,Great!!1,I loved it. It was very relaxing to my soul. Everything else didn't matter. This IS GREAT. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU WILL REMEMBER
5,The best mounts I've ever used.,"No complaints. I love these Warne mounts and I've used a bunch, including Leupold. Wouldn't use any other mounts and rings."

3,A Little easy for the advanced....,"I use this tape for my 'easy days'. But it is still enough to break a sweat, and it is a fun tape. The aerobic portion involves dance moves... and the music isn't bad for a work out tape. If you want any upper body work, you should use weights during the sculpting segments ---after you understand the moves, since they don't explain them on the tape."
2,"Lots of speculation, few concrete solutions","I forced myself to read it until the end and I'm glad I'm done with it--because I'm done with it not because it was all that great of a read. As an educator, I was hoping to read some more insightful discussion of how to engage students in the thinking process. Unfortunately, this book doesn't accomplish that. For those interested in learning more about neuroscience dimensions of education, I recommend ""How People Learn"" which is much more authoritative and recent."
2,Unsubstantiated and belabored.,"Despite the claim of the subtitle, the author can never really tell us why children don't think and what we can do about it. Every word of this book may be true; unfortunately, very little is substantiated. If repetition and anecdote proved anything, this would be a masterpiece. As it is, the book is four times the length it needs to make the points it makes.Until social scientists can unscramble the myriad of possible factors, e.g., single parenting, TV, video games, fluoride, we are just whistling Dixie. It is not even clear that there is a problem. I thought the author dismissed the Flynn Effect too matter of factly."
1,Pure bunk. Infectious nonsense. Hooey posing as science.,"As if U.S. schools were not saturated with enough child-damaging fads (whole language, constructivism, discovery learning, developmentally appropriate practices), Healy comes along and tries to provide a ""scientific"" foundation for faddish twaddle by deriving instructional practices from brain research that is considered questionable by brain researchers themselves. It's this sort of bunk that really endangers our children's minds."
4,"Definately a ""must read"" for parents and teachers.","I would highly recommend this book to both parents and teacher alike. Healy maintains an interesting writing style throughout the text, and actively engages her audience. While I do feel the text is rather long, it doesn't dissolve into random banter. The book stays focused until the end, providing many provoking lines of thought. For instance: Since the introduction of standardized schooling over a hundred years ago, the rate of literacy has radically declined. How did we go from a nation of unschooled but highly literate people, to a nation of overschooled and illiterate people? Such illuminations, beg discussion."

4,Architectural Graphics Second Edition,"From the Preface of the first edition. ""Although the text is intended for classroom use, it is written so that it can be understood by persons who do not have the personal help of a teacher. The procedure followed in presenting the various subjects is, first, to explain the characteristics of thetype of drawing and the principles used; te to give explanations and simple examples. In several cases explanations have been divided into a number of steps to simplify drawings and make the subject more easliy understood."" Divided into five major parts: Multi-View Drawing, Paraline Drawings, Perspective Drawing, Shades and Shadows, Study and Presentation Graphics. Very well illustrated throughout with clear line drawing instructions, architectural renderings, and model photos ."
5,A Beautiful Book Of One Man's Exceptional Residences,"If you believe in reincarnation and love old houses, you would surely want to ""come back"" as Richard Hampton Jenrette! (Who knows, maybe HE is the reinarnation of Alva Erskine Smith Vanderbilt Belmont, a peer, certainly, in the collection of wonderful houses.)This man has the most exquisite taste, a passion for historic houses and the decorative arts, and the means to indulge a lifestyle that can simply be described as sublime.This book is NOT a ""how to"" manual. It is an elegant recollection of a number of houses he has owned and obviously loved over the course of many years."
5,Perfect Fit,"Several of the tilt latches in my house were broken. These are 20 year old builder grade aluminum windows, and I took a chance on these since they looked the same and all the dimensions matched. I'm happy to say they fit perfectly. And they seem stronger also. The old ones were a more brittle white plastic and these replacements seem to be made of nylon."
3,Compatibility issue,"If you try to replace older Tilt Window Latch, make sure the size is right.I got a house built in 1997, and the Window Latch has similar size information but not fully match. This makes installation taking much longer and urgly.The older Window Latch has 2-1/4"" from side edge to the center of the hole (for mounting screw) with a round tail. This new latch has egde-to-edge size in 2-1/4"" with a squqre tail (cannot cover the older hole).Both mounting holes have to be redone. The older top hole will exposed because the tail side is shorter. make sure you have something to patch or cover it."
2,it didn't work,"I bought this glider,a dn when I received the box the tail was broken , due to I live abroad I couldn't excahnge it."
4,Familiar expectations,"This album concludes the story that started on the album ""Planets"" (1981). Maybe not the same intensity as its predecessor,but still unmistakebly Eloy! The overall production has got a sharper sound than usual, but don't let that put anyone off buying it. Their first drummer, Fritz Randow returned for this album and my personal highlights of this album will have to be ""Through A Somber Galaxy"", ""Behind The Walls Of Imagination"" and ""End Of An Odyssey"". This album sits nicely between ""Planets"" and ""Performance"". Typical Eloy. Need I say more?"
2,Over and out,"This band shouldn't be confused with the one that made wonderful Enjoy the melodic sunshine. There's a new line up. Missing is Daniel Wylie, the guy who wrote and sang the songs and boy does it show. On the evidence of Too close to see far, his replacement, Stephen Fleming has some distance to go before he reaches the giddy heights of his former band mate in both the song writing and singing departments. There are one or two good songs, Because you and Justify the rain but mostly it's blandness that verges on middle of the road like a bad version of the Eagles. I can't see them surviving as there are too many great bands around these days. CRR = RIP."
2,A Stunningly Competent Follow-Up From Glasgow's Finest,"This CD posesses none of the edginess and hints of danger of the previous release. The songs are pleasant but completely forgettable. From start to finish this disc screams, or perhaps utters in a monotone, of ""okay-ness"""
4,"Quality Item, Lots of Spots for Balls","Good looking, quality item. Plenty of spots to display the balls and the cabinet is a good size."
2,AK Golfer,"For the price, this was a good product. Well made, packaged and delivered timely. However, I ordered two of the same item, shipped at the same time and when they arrived, they were two different colors. If that doesn't bother you, than you are good to go. If it does, you may want to consider ordering from someone else. For the price, I didn't bother sending them back, but you may try contacting the vendor."
3,Golf ball Cabinets,"I thought I had ordered the Premium golf ball cabinet like two others I had purchased thru Bass Pro Shop, but instead I received the Executive cabinet, which is nice but not the same size as my other two. In the future I'll be more careful when I order on-line merchandise thru Amazon.com."
3,It'll work,"Not bad for a cheap way to display a small collection of golf balls.The wood came marked up a bit and the felt backing has a few wrinkles. Quality control is most likely not a big concern for this manufacturer but like I said, it was fairly cheap."
1,What a disappointment,"I purchased this item as a gift and was embarrassed by the quality-the corner was damaged, and the item was warped so that the shelves were coming out of one side. THe stain was very uneven and it had a horrific chemical smell.I was frightened by the sticker indicating that the item passed the ""formaldehyde release carb"", though by the odor I have my doubts. All in all a real bummer.I dont want to go through the hassle of a return. Already spent enough."
4,Nice unit,I ordered this unit to display autographed golf balls that I received for working the LPGA golf tournament in Naples.
5,Perfect gift for golf pro,Purchased this for our new son inlaw as a gift. He is a golf pro with a large collection of balls. This is perfect. It is a nice size and fits on a bookshelf. Looks very nice and keeps all those balls frimrolling around. Will order more.
5,Great Golf Ball Display Cabinet,I ordered this golf ball display cabinet for my Husband for his birthday. It was so inexpensive I didn't know what to expect. When it arrived and I opened it I was astonished to find that the quality of this display cabinet was excellent. My husband was very happy with it and he put it on his office wall. It looks great. I would highly recommend this golf ball display cabinet for anyone who wants the best for less. We are extremely happy with it.
4,Good for the price,"Does exactly what it says it does - it displays golf balls. Nothing too fancy here - relatively cheap wood, but good high gloss finish and decent construction. Suitable for hanging on the wall. Golf balls fit nicely next to each other, no touching or rolling (because of the divots for securing each ball). Overall, very nice."
4,Overall Good with one quality control issue.,"The only issue limiting a 5 star rating is that some of the staples that hold the back panel to the frame are misaligned. The net result is the upper right corner of the back panel is not flush with the frame. Fortunately, once the cabinet is placed on my display shelf there is no one that will notice. Also, I this is a second purchase so I have cabinets side by side to compare. The Cherry Finish does not match. Bottom Line. The size, shape, and reasonable cost complements what already own. Once the golf balls are one the case and the dust settles, then the issue fades from memory... :-)"
5,excellent condition and prompt service...,Thank you for your prompt service. The book arrived in excellent condition and looked absolutely new. I will definitely order from you again. Also thanks for the super low price.
5,fast shipping!,fast shipping! the item is in a condition exactly what was described before i bought a book. satisfied!!
2,"Good quality, bad shipping","The book was in excellent condition (Despite being listed as ""good""). The only problem was the shipping. They only offer one form of shipping and they offer no tracking whatsoever. It still arrived on time, but it would be nice to know where it's at.2/5 for the shipping issue."
3,some of what was supposed to be there,"The book content itself is great. The problem is from the seller, the cover was not ""slightly"" bent or torn it had been completely ripped in half and then glued back together (though glued together as well as possible considering) also the ACE organic part of the book that I specifically wanted was not included, instead an access code to a different Prentice Hall online tool was what came in the book."
3,"mostly pretty good, but some sub-par renditions","I have five versions now of these lovely (1741) chamber pieces of Rameau's... with 3 more on the way. I wish I could be more specific, but while much of the string playing is clearly excellent, some of it (within the first 6 or 7 tracks especially - which comprise the 4th & 2nd ""Concert"") has noticeably ""dubious"" intonation that is distracting. Mr. Mitchell? Ms. Crum? What's up with that? Almost sounds like a ""pick-up"" group. Cold room? Not that *I* could play it better, but I do expect better from a professional recording, sorry. - usually very satisfied, usually not critical. Not my first choice. Get Leonhardt/Kuijken(s)/Bruggen's recording (Teldec) or maybe Sonnerie's w/Mitzi Meyerson on Virgin Veritas."
2,Broke early,"Worked well while I had it. Broke after a few shoots. The metal attachment at the non-button end came off the black cord part. I tried taping it really well but that made no difference. If you get one, I recommend trying to reinforce that connection early, perhaps a light crimping, I don't know.I used it with a Bronica S-2."
1,It broke on me after 2 exposures,"This cable felt solid and fit into all of my cameras. I set up the shot and was able to get 2 exposures before the cable exploded and broke into a bunch of pieces. It sucked because I was so excited for the shot. On a positive note, Adorama handled the problem well and gave me a full refund and I didn't have to send the broken cable back."
5,Very good DVI cable.,"Bought two of these DVI cables for my new custom built PC. They are strong and well built, and serve well between my two monitors and my PC. Excellent price for such good quality. I would recommend these cables to anyone."
5,Excellent Cable,This cable does what it suppose to do. I especially like the white ends. This is a quality built cable. I have used it for a long time now and have no problems.
5,Great length,I bought a new computer at work and needed to place the tower further than the standard 6 feet away from the monitors (or have cables coming over the top of the desk). An older monitor has the DVI connectors and these have worked perfectly with the extra length.
5,fits right in,"I had a narrow space, for which this is perfect. It has depth, giving it a artful look, and the simplicity doesn't command too much attention. The pendulum has a 5"" swing, which is just right; not too much movement; light and smooth. a very quiet clock. The silver bevel is a touch glittery and the black base beautifully finished with a slight inward edge. lots of subtle, classic touches, esp. for the price. came with a quality battery. came with a super power ace A battery."
1,Petty and Pompously Pedantic!,"Petty, pompously pedantic to no good result, including a truly missing ingredient - called a story. This was not the worst non-attempt at story telling I have read, but it is certainly in the top five. Thank goodness it was my first book by this author, so I am saved from further excursions into his non-stories. When I read, I want to 'experience' a story, not drown in an author's self-important pretentions and disdain for the idiot reader ""feasting"" on the imagined insights of a bitter view on life. Certainly not to be considered literature, and not even up to the level of so-called 'pulp'! If I could get a refund, I would, to prevent anyone from profiting from these 'wasted trees'. Bill barth, Sr."
4,Noir For Intellectuals,"So you like crime stories and Harper's magazine? Harrison (a Harper's editor) provides insight and tension in this brilliant book. Not as powerful, perhaps, as his earlier work, ""Bodies Electric"" (which is sadly out of print), but a thrilling journey nonetheless."
3,"RICHLY AMBIENT SEX AND CRIME, WEAKENED BY STRAINED PLOT.","As a dazzling dream Gotham and a nightmarish Big Poison Apple merge, author Harrison creates a world where silk dresses and street grit intermingle in sensually evocative grandeur. The author aims to imbue a contemporary New York crime story with the vaporous, yet hard-edged aura of classic film noir. But like one of that movie genre's landmark's, Bogart's ""The Big Sleep,"" the evocative atmospherics and intriguing characters of ""Manhattan Nocturne"" often push plot and pacing to the margin.Th"
3,The gift of gab,"The author can write. Big long paragraphs fill the pages. It goes on & on. It does hold interest, but to what end? It just doesn't satisfy. A writer in need of a good editor."
1,Abysmal,"After suffering through Harrison's Afterburn, one of the worst novels I've ever read, I began wondering if maybe Afterburn was a fluke, that Harrison really had some ability. Well, guess what -- he doesnt, to judge by this tale of mechanistic sex and corporate malfeasance in the ""dark seamy"" underbelly of Manhattan. Newspaper columnist has torrid affair with love bunny. Cheats on wife and kids. There's stolen videocassettes, abandoned property, Rudy Guiliani, sex sex and more sex, utterly unrealistic dialogue, a lot of blathering about meaning of life. I'm supposed to like these people? I'm supposed to care? Does Harrison know how to write a sympathetic character? Does he know how to write, period? The jury has deliberated, and the verdict is in: Harrison is guilty of major crimes against literature. Off to the salt mines with you, buddy. It did wonders for Dostoevsky."
1,nay,"The title of this book talks the talk but the pages don't walk the walk. It wasn't the entertaining read that i expected. the book is not comprehensive enough to be of any use and at times, it appeared, not mature enough for the audience I believe the author is catering to."
4,Trivial but fun,"The book's tital says it all, LOL.Fun, silly read basically tells you anything that a regular magazine could, but it was still a cute effort by the author."
4,"Lots of history, amazing history!","This book provides a through tour of the history of women in sports, not individuals, but rather the policys of women playing sports. Topics such as who should control the sport (and the women!), promotional and commercial sports vs. for-fitness-only sports, and the debates about if sports made men 'manly' then would they make women 'manly' too?Many readers will find the abundance of historical information hard to read, but I highly suggest making the effort if you want a good understanding of just how far women have had to go to play the games they love!"
4,For the sportswoman in all of us,An excellent book for women who love sports or for those interested in womens studies. A must for coaches and pre Title 9 thinkers!
5,Love this item,I bought two of these for my husband and he loved them.I only got one at the initial shipping and called the company and they sent another one out with no hassle and i got it in five days.We have gotten several compliments on these and they have held up great so far!! Go Niners!!
1,defected item,"I received a defected item and It was not the flag I order, the flag was sewm upside down"
1,Demeaning,"After flipping through this book, I felt belittled and demeaned. This book is setup as though designed for a 4th grade student to write grants. The assumption put forth by its design and content is that teachers are either too inept or too stupid to understand the more sophisticated nuances of grant writing. I have read many other grant writing books (not specifically designed for teachers) and they are far more complex, filled with worthwhile content to assist one in writing effective grants. Space in this book is wasted on Mad Libs and crossword puzzles when it should be devoted to actual tips and strategies that will make grant writing a realistic and successful possibility for today's teachers. Very disappointing."
2,Writing a lesson plan is easy and so is this book,"This book, while helpful and a good start is a little too simplistic to be really useful. I was just expecting more from the book than I really got. While it makes writing a grant look easy, unfortunately there is no real meat to the book. I was somewhat disappointed in the book when I received it the other day. However, it does have some great lists of words that are useful for writing; to better convey your meanings and it does have some good graphic organizers to help you plan."
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!,"What a dissapointment and a waste of time. First book of JanetDaileys that I didn't bother to finish. There was ""nothing"" between the characters!"
1,Absolutely horrible,"Rarely have I suffered through a romance novel as I did ""A Capital Holiday."" Given Dailey's previous works, I was sure this one was just a little slow at first, but would pick up steam any page now. Forget it!!! The description of the heroine was over-the-top, the plot was insipid, and the hero was a big dork. Even the names were embarassingly sophomoric. I can't think of one reason to recommend this bood except perhaps insomnia! I wasted my money--don't do the same!"
1,Save Your Time and Money!,"This is the first book of Janet Dailey's that I have read. It lacks the essential ingrediant to hold the reader's interest - a creative, intriguing plot. It took me over 2 weeks to read this book. I certainly hope that if I choose to read another of Ms. Dailey's books that I will not be so disappointed."
2,Flat,"I've enjoyed the Calder Series and was looking forward to this read. Very disappointing. A chore to get through. Tucker's ""aw shucks"" attitude was annoying, the rest of the book slow. It took ten pages to get a scraped knee cleaned up! Good White House history tidbits were the only salvation to this novel."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"This book is the biggest waste of time in my ten years of reading romance....I was SOOOOOO disappointed. I am a major fan of the Calder series and have read some other Janet Dailey stuff. Based on her previous novels, I take her as a given author and have no problem purchasing her books....I certainly wasted my money on this one......PLEASE, don't bother!!!"
3,"The ultimate stoner movie, but otherwise, just weird and reeeeaally sexist :^(","Bondi Tsunami is full of trippy video special effects, trippy music and the rambling semi-logical philosophical musings of the protagonist, Skark. It is kinda funny, but there's hardly any dialogue, hardly a plot, and the one female character is so demeaned and so fully humiliated in the movie that it's unbelievable it was actually made less than fifty years ago."
2,Spyglass,"I work on a boat and I just wanted to mess around and bring it out when the guys were watching. The spyglass actually works fine, but it has its limitations. One of which is finding what you are pointing at and the other is focusing. Once you get the hang of it it gets somewhat easier, but not much."
4,Range and Satisfaction,"Although disappointing because it only contains 3 songs, this single does redeem itself because those 3 songs are quite varied. ""Only Happy When It Rains"" has hard guitar riffs and driving beats, yet remains poppy. ""Girl Don't Come"" has the same effect, but replaces poppy with dark. Finally, ""Sleep"" is quiet and ethereal and really shows of the lower notes in Shirley's range."
5,A nice range of styles from Shirley and the boys.,"There are three tracks on this single: 1) Only Happy When It Rains; 2) Girl Don't Come; and 3) Sleep. I liked all of them. Any Garbage fan should already know ""Only Happy When It Rains"" from their first CD. The second track, ""Girl Don't Come"", is a hard driving tune with a bit of industrial-style grittiness. Nice production work melds the effects into a good song. The real gem on this single is the third track, ""Sleep"". In direct contrast to the first two tracks, ""Sleep"" is a soft tune with an interesting rhythm and a great vocal performance from Shirley. Singing at what is probably the lower portion of her vocal range, you get to hear Shirley at her sultry best."
5,Pioneer Brand Peppered Gravy Mix,"Pioneer Brand Gravy Mix, Country, 2.75-Ounce Packets (Pack of 24)I had this gravy at the Breakfast Buffet in the motel in Branson, MO.Very Good!!! The waitress told me the name, so I looked it up on the Internet and found it at Amazon. I give it the Excellent Rating"
3,Are there 2 different versions???,"Anyone know if there are 2 different versions?? The one I have has this track listing, but I purchased it thinking that I was getting this other track listing:1. Toxic - Britney Spears2. Me, Myself And I - Beyonce3. With You - Jessica Simpson4. Hold On - Good Charlotte5. Stand Up - Ludacris6. Read Your Mind - Avant7. Holidae In - Chingy8. Gangsta Nation - Westside Connection9. It's My Life - No Doubt10. First Cut Is The Deepest, The - Sheryl Crow11. Feelin' It - Blink 18212. Change Clothes - Jay-Z13. Away From The Sun - 3 Doors Down14. Step In The Name Of Love - R. Kelly15. I Don't Want You Back - Eamon16. Gigolo - Nick Cannon17. 100 Years - Five For Fighting18. This I Swear - Nick Lachey19. I Hate Everything About You - Three Days Grace20. Sunrise - Norah JonesI gave it 3 stars because I was expecting to get four other songs that I wanted, but instead got four songs that I didn't care to get."
5,Excellent!,"I know it's out of stock ... but occasionally you can find the Japanese version at good record stores. This is probably my favorite Enigma single because the music is great and it was so difficult to find. So it has even bigger of a story to it for me. (Sadeness p.I would be 1, but this took sooooo long for me to find...)The tracks are excellent. The Radio Edit is a piece in itself. The Everlasting Lust Mix is like an extended version of the Radio Edit, but with more effects ... more breathing ... The Omen Mix is a techno remix that reminds me of looking at the moon on a starry night or something. And the Meditation Mix of Sadness is just great. Hope everyone who likes Enigma gets to enjoy this CD."
2,disappointed,"The wig was true to color, but it tangled so quickly and was not brushable. Had to throw it out after a couple of wears."
5,A BAND-AID WITH RAZOR BLADES,"The greatest lyrics leave you feeling completely vulnerable and yet stronger from the experience. This is definietely one of those albums.Josh Bloomberg tells his stories of unrequited love, loniliness, and the death of an older brother - and tells them all with naked honesty and a sardonic sense of humor. He's a poet's lyricist and my therapist.This is a ""must have"" album."
3,Too much pagan/mythical fantasy,"I've read all Hawkenlye Mysteries in order up to this book. The mysteries around Josse and the abbess are great read and can compare to Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael books, Roger the Chapman and other medieval mysteries. What puts me off with the recent books is the extensive elaboration of mythical phantasies around Joanna and the forest people. It disrupts the story by deviating too much too long into narrations that are unrelated to the original story, the respective murder or felony and the lovable characters at the abbey. I found myself just skipping those 45 pages about Joanna's ""education"" and continued with the original story: didn't miss anything important."
5,The real face of the communist regime,"A fascinating book revealing terrible but true facts about an antihuman regime that stopped the development of Eastern Europe for more than four decades. A must read for all academic readers dealing with modern Eastern European history and political science and a great reading for all other readers, interested in the communist crimes in Bulgaria and Eastern Europe.After researching thousands of pages of secret documents, prepared by the spooky Bulgarian communist secret service- DS (State Security) and FBI, Alexenia Dimitrova managed to write a powerful account about the activities of the Bulgarian secret service during the Cold War. Gruesome murders, extortions, kidnappings, imprisoning of free thinkers, targeting and profiling of Bulgarian immigrants were an integral part of the Bulgarian communist secret service schedule.It is definitely a book, which can keep every reader's attention from cover to cover."
2,Nice pencil work,"I waited for the book with anticipation due to the review. But it gave me a mixed feeling while going through the work.It is interesting to see that the whole art work is done in pencil and each pictures are well presented, I would give a 3.5 for the art alone. The skill of presentation can still be improved.The story line on the other hand gives me a very slow feeling and lacking in excitement. The story line is very normal and lacking in surprises. The author did not manage to raise my emotion thorugh the stories."
4,Who is Marx?,I found an antique copy of this in a store and decided to bring it home and read it again. It is so hard to read or review a book like this objectively and cannot begin to. I will leave the content review to others.I suggest you read this book for its insight into history and the events of a very important time in world affairs. I promise you that this is not the book you think it is.Marx was a remarkable man and is not much read among his critics. Do yourself a favor and make this the year you discover this man and his thoughts.This is a good book to start with but do not end here.
4,"A fascinating historic work, even from a capitalist viewpoint.","Regardless of your political viewpoints, The Communist Manifesto is a fascinating historic work lending context to the failed and/or decaying ""communist"" societies of our own day. Being written over 150 years ago, the style may be hard to follow, but the core messages and thought processes are clear, notwithstanding the twisted idealism. I find it fascinating to (attempt to) follow the thin logic and faulty premises that are required to make Marx's visions plausible, and encourage all American's to familiarize themselves with these arguments. Many of them are all too familiar.Overall: 4 of 5 for historical value."
2,not the martin malia edition,"Just so all who are thinking about buying the Kindle edition know: the Signet Classic edition features an introduction by Martin Malia, which is outstanding in every respect. The link from that edition takes you to the one you are thinking of buying now, but which is actually a different edition of the Manifesto. The Signet edition is worth buying just for Malia's introduction. Don't purchase this edition if you want the best available. Instead, get Amazon to request the Signet edition in Kindle form (please!). Currently there's no way to do this. But one can always hope..."
5,Down with capitalism!,"Before I read this book I was a nieve child who hated communism. I was ignorent and i had no idea what is was talking about because my parents taught me to hate communism. We are in an anti-communistsic age and i think more people should read this book. Today communism is best known as human suffering, actuallly that is totalitarianism. Unfortunately most of the communist countries were totalitarian. I'm outraged that our scholl systems is anti-communist, because in history class they only tell you the cons of the communist countries. Communism is a very good idea next to our capitalist scociety.Everyone I know thinks communism is a way your country is politically runned. Actually its is how economiclally one country is run.This book turned me in to a leftist and i think more ignorent Americans should read this book."
2,Dry,"Unfortunatly, I was forced to read this book, so I did not enjoy it as much as I should have. While very informative, it was very dry. This is understandable because it was not for pleasure, but information. I don't think it was a good book overall. The book made it clear why communism would not work. Not many people are willing to give up their property to the government."
5,A possible future,"With the events in our country under Bush, the possible world could look like a communist outlook. It is revealing on the insights, religion, and world under tight rule. We are lucky to live in America where we can change things with our government if we don't like it. We have the freedoms to work with us on many issues. This is an excellent book."
1,Far from being the best,I was not convinced by Marx's ideas and arguments. I think that the best books written those last centuries are instead Hitler's Mein Kampf and Darwin's The Descent of Man.
1,Foolish and unrealistic,"This book blueprints the most moronic political philosophy in world history which has proven itself time and time again to be murderous and completely unworkable. Marx proved almost prophetic in the first line of the book: ""A spectre is haunting Europe, the spectre of communism."" Yes indeed. Communism is certainly a spectre, nothing more than a dead ghost backed up by the ghosts of the millions who died under the hateful regimes the rose in the name of this rotten little book."
3,Negative/Optimistic,"The first half of this book provides some fairly good insight into the effects of capitalism. It outlines how classes are easily divided by the system of capitalism, and notes the inherent inequalities of the capitalist system. Marx is, however, very doomsday. he underestimates ones ability to move up or advance in the capitalist system and his outlook is completely negative of the system entirely.Unlike his negative assessment of capitalism, Marx expresses extreme hope in the good of humanity as seen in teh second half of the manifesto. Marx apparently believes that human nature is entirely changeable. One must wonder how Marx would eliminate laziness, selfishness, and other qualities many consider innate.Overall, Marx makes some good observations about the effects of capitalism. His solution however, is completely absurd. He gives far too much credit to the ability of a communist state and human nature."
3,A piece of world history,Amazons shipping was incredibly fast and the book arrived in good shape. Karl Marx is a world figure in history and has very intriguing ideologies on the world we live in. Whether or not you agree with communism you should read this book. Just to be aware of a different perspective. I personally believe that many of Marx's theories were correct but his solution was wrong. Still a very insightful piece of literature.
2,Fun to read but marred by bollocks,"A stirring and fascinating manifesto that, according to Peter Kreeft, created Communism.The question Marx doesn't address, and that Marxists disregard, is whether or not it's true. Is the history of society the history of class conflict, or have some classes and societies been peaceable and happy with settled economic, class, educational, family, and cultural distinctions that contributed to the overall good?Arthurian England, Theodora's Byzantium, Confuscious' China, what about these?The tone is bombastic and revolutionary without the substance required to justify it. Still fun to read, but a book has to satisfy two criteria: to please and instruct. This merely pleases."
2,"Surpassing the good, then the bad, and then the ugly...","The only reason this book doesn't recieve one star is that it clearly states the moral principles of communism, and any collectivist government you wish to find. It is incredibly useful if you want to understand the morality (or lack thereof) of communism. Relatively clearly written, it doesn't openly fall into the basic faults of communism.Still, if you're not looking for ammunition against Communism/collectivism and instead are looking for a philosophy to guide your actions, avoid this book like the plague."
4,I like it,"It's a nice book for any economy' student. and what it's even greater is that is for free, truly recommended"
5,Nice Version of a Classic,Marx's 1848 Communist Manifesto is arguably the most influential text of the nineteenth century - clearly the most significant piece of political philosophy stemming from that period. This small text does a nice job of situating Marx's work and introducing the manifesto.Marx is essential reading for all students of history and the Communist Manifesto is the ideal starting point. I highly recommend this text to all readers..
4,The Communist Manifesto,This book was part of my son's reading for his English class. The book arrived in plenty of time. Thank you!
3,Well...,"It is pretty boring. I guess I expected something more shocking. Definitely educational, not entertainment."
3,Not what I was expecting.,This is text is definitely a must read but it was not at all what I was expecting it to be. The text itself is only about 40 pages long and very repetitive. It seems to me that it was more aimed at mobilizing the middle/lower classes to overthrow the upper class rather than have an intellectual discussion and analysis of communistic type systems.
4,Forgot to take other factors into account.,"A well written treatise, on par with Plato's ""Republic"" and Sir Thomas More's ""Utopia"". END"
1,WALL IS OVER!,"If you buy these rants because it's required reading at school, welcome to the club: I too had to waste my youth going through this short but oh-so-boring book.However, if you buy it because it's your kind of Holy Gospel, wake up and smell the coffee! The Party's over and no one is complaining!"
1,Hate Litterature,"When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people. But that is what hate litterature does. This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the ""masses"" to hate."
1,"History has shown Marx to be wrong, but this is an important historical work.","While I am not swayed by Marx's historical perspective, nor am I swayed by his prescription for how to solve what I believe to be an overblown, if not altogether nonexistent, problem, I think that this is an important book that every American should read. Unfortunately, the last people to read this book are the ones who should read it the most.Conservatives who march around calling Obama a socialist or a communist really should at least take the time and make the effort to understand the system that they criticize. There is enough within the actual doctrine of communism with which you may disagree without having to run around in the streets attacking straw men.Not to mention, this book is surprisingly short. It is not very long, and it is not very hard to read. Only the slovenly intellectual mind can refuse to read such a pithy book that has had such a profound impact on human thought."
3,An interesting read.,"Had heard about this for years when still in school but never read it. Finally got around to it. Not what I expected. Has some interesting ideas and I promise, it won't turn you into an instant communist. If you want a primer on how other forms of government think this is a good place to start."
5,Good short read,Short and to the point if you're trying to brush up on required reading. I'd recommend this to anyone not familiar with the way of communism.
3,informational,The book is smaller than I anticipated but is what I was looking for. Actually you can pull this stuff up on the Internet but I much prefer having it in hard copy writing in front of me when I am searching for facts from it.
3,"Not my favorite, but...","Purchased more out of curiosity than any real interest. We touched on the ideas of the manifesto in some of my philosophy classes, so I just wanted to get an idea of the writer's ideology as a whole."
5,Good Historical Piece,Its a good book to read to understand the context of much of what went on the late 19th and the 20th century
4,Education and Insight,"As other reviewers have noted, regardless of one's political views this is an important work. Beyond its historical significance, reading it provides a glimpse into what made it so popular for so long: the authors' new world view, their amazing foresight (and false predictions!), their rallying cry to radicals everywhere.This edition provides excellent insight into the background, influences and setting of its writing. The introduction is great history and education, but even if one reads only the actual Manifesto, the end notes add so much! And while the end notes are almost as long as the work itself, don't neglect them: they add so much insight into the environment (and, as one reviewer here mentions, Marx's grudges) in which it was written.I'm glad I finally read this - and I'm glad I picked up this edition; I've now a much better understanding of its adherents' tenets and philosophy."
3,It did present interesting thoughts,"I read this book in 7th grade and I fully understood it. It was not the best political book I have ever read. His ideas have been tried and they all failed. First of all, people will not willingly give up power like that. With this book being written in the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain, I can see his point, but his theory is only a theory. Overall, this was an ok book."
1,"Oh, but that wasn't real communism there...","Yeah. But Soviet Russia and Red China weren't ""reeeeaaall communist"" nations, as goes the typical cry. There are some problems with communism as a philosophy: 1, ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need."" Ok, who defines ""neeeeeed""? Another, where is the great divide between worker and capitalist now? If anything, there are more people in management, and more people with stock in companies that are also of the ""working class.""The best thing is this: it's typical for a leftist/communist to cry about the ""surplus value of labor,"" that the worker is making a profit for the capitalist. They scream that the worker should get the profit from their work, yet they believe in a system that has no private property rights. But wait! I thought the worker should keep his profit? Or, do they have any claim to it, since they can't own anything?Obvious paradoxes scream out in communism."
1,"Didn't work, Isn't working, and Won't work","I find it amazing the credence that people still insist upon giving this idealogical work. After so many years and so many millions of lives lost or spent under oppression, when will this delusional hatred of the individual end? The philosophies put forth in this book simply lead to tyranny. Proof enough is the fact that not one communist nation remaining can claim to be anything more than a third-world economic, cultural, and social power. When people start living for the state, instead of living for themselves, humanity itself is lost."
1,selfish drivel,it takes a soft mind to believe legalizing theft and destroying private property has a prosperous future. had the authors been gainfully employed they might have viewed the world less selfishly. there is no more solipsistic ideology in the world than what is put forth on these pages.
1,Ignorance is bliss,"You can say ""Well I guess he didn't understand the deeper meaning."" The truth is, I'm not sure if I did, but I don't hink that I care to!"
1,Communist ideology,"The book starts out very intriguing, introcucing the bourgeois, and the common (worker class) people; however it quickly turns into how communism is the answer to all of 'today's' (at least, the early 1900's) problems.History has shown us, that much of this information is inaccurate (China, Russia, Cuba,...); and that communism is a great way to make people lazy, and caught up in paperwork.Communistic ideas had a few good things though, they wanted to get rid of the poorest as well as the Bourgeois. But the communists wanted the poor to be able to live a respectable life, while the Bourgeois wanted to get rid of the poorest because the poorest where robbing from the richest (not seeing that the richest did exactly the same thing, only under a mantle of agreements and contracts)."
2,Hot Air Marxist Style,"Although this book was well intentioned, the idea of power to the people more often created inequality between the masses and personal enrichment for members of the party leadership. In Secondly working for the greater good of ""the people"" was used to justify several purges in the 20th century of those who did not support communist ideas and or ""the will of the people"" also known as (the communist party)."
4,Good Introduction to Leftist Thinking,"This is obviously the quintessential pamphlet on communism, and it provides basic information in regards to communism. However, in order to truely understand communism and other leftist philosophies one must explore more indepth novels."
3,over 100 millino dead and counting,"Read your history and the books that influence it. This book has ruined nations, killed 100 plus million and was highly influential on socialist agendas as well.It all sounds so good when you read it but unfortunately a little common sense on how humans tick would tip you off that this won't work and it didn't.Read hayeks the road to serfdom for an excellent counterpoint to this.Read Atlas Shrugged for a far more enjoyable read (it has romantic elements so boys & girls will read it) to highlight the lessons in madness that books like the manifesto or other socialist fantasies can lead too.As a book the manifesto is trash, junk social science but given its impact on China, Russia, the Ethiopian ""famine"", the destruction of Cuban industry after the revolution, Viet Nam, Cambodia, North Korea and countless disasters in other countries the evil it has brought about makes it a must read."
2,Marx is a Naive Utopianistic Idealist,"Marx writes from the assumption that man is basically good, that he will put the welfare of mankind in front of that of himself. Unfortunately, this is not true. Man, in general, works only for personal incentive.However, the writing style is at the very least interesting and Marx does do an excellent job in recognizing the role that economics plays and has played in history.But, if anyone wishes to really know how economics should, does, and always will work, they should read Adam's Smith's 'Wealth of Nations,' and ignore this, for the most part, worthless pamphlet."
5,It is a masterpiece of world litterature.,"This pamphlet have inspiered millions of people all around the world to fight against opression. It has influenced the thinking of people living under various conditions so that they have got confidence in them selves and their own kind to stand up against the rich and welthy. Many sentences of the book have become slogans to change the world : Workers of the world, unite !"
2,Read it to see what kind of idiots they were,"Having spent my youth in a Socialist country, I have had to study this book thoroughly more than once. The Communists consider it a kind of a bible. It's truely amazing, because when you read it, you can't help noticing that only people of very low intellect are able to write such text. I'm not talking about the acceptability of ideas. I've read books that make me seethe with rage. The Communist Manifesto doesn't. It's disjointed babble. Even if you hate Communism as much as I do, this book won't make you angry. It's impossible to critisize the contents of the book, because it has no contents, except making obvious that the emperor is naked. I have never seen a Communist work of such incapability."
2,A Masterpiece in Backward Thinking,"The Communist Manifesto offers what sounds like a utopian society where all the bad capitalists get theirs. Unfortunately, there are no checks and balances in the Manifesto to protect the very people it seeks to free. Without anything to hold back the natural wickedness of men, the Manifesto releases evil men to perpetrate on society all the evils it sought to destroy. In quest for a savior in the political process, the Manifesto opens the door allowing the devil to run through and run rough-shod over humanity.Everyone should read and be knowledgeable of The Communist Manifesto so that evil empires like the USSR and Communist China will never be created again."
1,I have never read this book,"I have never read this book, but am about to order it. The reason people shun communism is because they have been subjected by the media to the brute reality of it. A friend of mine once asked me which I truely hated, the ideals of communism or the reality of it. And this opened my mind up to enormous expansion. Communism need not be ruled under an ""Iron Curtain."" In fact, a communist status can be reached in the USA while still keeping the constitution intact. Anyone who rambles on about the horrors of communism is most likely rambling with an empty mind. The Soviet Union may have filled their people with propaganda, but anyone who can make a legitimate arguement that the USA hasn't done it's share of lying would be welcome to try and explain such a phenomenom."
3,A little work which helped bring about great disaster,"This little work is one of the key statements of the Communist theory which came to rule in the Soviet Union. However idealistic and innocent , and there is no doubt question about this, the authors were in their analysis of exploiting capitalism, and a proletarian which would inevitably revolt and overthrow it the fact is that the Communism which came into the world in the wake of this book and Kapital was a great disaster for mankind. Millions of lives were sacrificed to the utopian goals outlined in this manifesto. It is remarkable that anyone today after the horrors brought about the Soviet Gulag could think to defend this work's analysis of the capitalistic system."
3,good written book about ridiculous political movement,"This book points out some of the reasons why ""laissez affair"" capitalism was not good for a political system. However it also brings out the failures of marxism and its idiotic goals. I too encourage people to read this book to realise that ""Communism in Theory is a good system"" is a load of hypocrasy and made up by people who try to be more original than others only making themselves look like idiots. Read this book and aknowledge the fact that marxism, socialism and communism are dead struggles for inhumanity, destruction of tradition and destruction of feedom both economically and socially."
2,"Obama voters, this is for you.","I have read it and realized that only lazy, freeloading liberals who thrive on controlling the public like pets enjoy not only communism, but liberalism as well. So if you are a cashier or work at a coffee shop and hate others for having more than yourself, this book is perfect for you."
1,Antique prose,It is cheaper than a sleeping pill. Guess you would have needed to have the perspective of the working class of that time to see any value in this work. Had to write about it for a college assignment in a Sociology class 50 years ago and it doesn't look any better to me now.
1,Profiteer Introduces Error Into Manifesto!,"After several years of trying, I finally got Project Gutenberg to remove an error I found close to the beginning of its version of the text: ""It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless and feasible [sic] chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom--Free Trade."" -- the correct word is ""indefeasible"" meaning inalienable. It is very interesting that this text replicates that very error; it would appear that CreateSpace copied and printed Project Gutenberg's faulty edition!"
2,Not as good as I had hoped.,This book was not as good a read as I had hoped. It is well written but not exactly what I had anticipated.
3,Manifesto review,"The book was very interesting, well written and concise. I was surprised how easy a read this was. Though overall I am not sure I gained any more insight into the ideas of the Communist party like I had hoped."
4,Essential read,"This is an essential read for anyone who has ever complained about political systems. Read this very short book and inform yourself of where ""these guys"" are coming from. The book is not easy to read in some places because of the now out-dated writing style (and German author), but it's worth the time."
3,good writing,"For long I've wanted to check out this book and finally I had gotten my hands on it. It's quite short, which surprised me...but packs a lot of content. The version that I've read is by Engels who I am guessing translated it. And did he do a good job. Writing aside, I don't necessarily agree with Marx's ideas. I didn't like the fact how he constantly criticized burgeoise as this evil entity that has destroyed the working class. That is not true. We are who we are, and we live the way we live, because we didn't incorporate Marx's ideas into our system. European countries that have strode away from these ideas have also succeeded. To sum it up, while TCM is a magnificent historical classic, written in beautiful language, I do not believe that Marx's ideologies are righteous. Enjoy!"
2,Lacking.,"I expected to hear more about the vision of communism, not just have the problem repeated a dozen times, very disappointing."
3,The Communist Manifesto,"I wanted to read this to see exactly how they work, and wasn't suprise to see many of the programs in America, especially from the Democrats, are in our government. I have been watching ""America Heritage"" in church, and have learned that what our founding fathers meant is what our government is saying. One passage from this book, really stuck me. It said that they are for the downfall of the family and listening to the Democrats, that is what they have been doing since the 1960's and started in the 40's with FDR.If you want to see what, and how they work, and their mindset, read this book."
2,Be Afraid!,"Every self respecting man woman and child should read the communist manifesto not to gain some kind of hopeful message, but instead to understand the truly radical nature of the communists. My favorite line is ""Abolition of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the communists."" This and other shocking plots are contained within this infamous work. While trying to re-write history, the communists Marx and Engels create a false reality where there ideas can work. But read this manifesto to understand fully why you should truly be afraid of the communist menace! Watch how modern liberals are doing nothing less than carrying out the directives in the manifesto. Be Afraid and Be Aware!!"
1,Pure Garbage,"This is the worst piece of trash ever written. Marx expounds line after line of putrid, uneducated drabble. His view of history is one of the funniest ideas ever concieved. The worst thing that he manages to concoct is the theory of polylogism. The only reason that this theory was developed was because the classical economists completely refuted everything that he came up with. They did this with logic though. So, Marx thought, we have to ditch logic. Besides, proletarians have a differebt logic anyway. HIs conclusions are absolutely laughable. Along with his other garbage piece, Das Kapital, he manages to concoct some of the most preposterous drivle in all of history. His socialist threory is not even original. It is virtually the same as David Ricardo's vision of the socialist state. This book is not worth the paper that it is printed on. It is quite funny however that people actually take it seriously."
2,Hard to understand in the 21th Century,I was so looking forward to reading THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO I wanted to see what all the Buzz was about. I like most heard many things about this book both good and bad. It is a short read but many of the terms and geographic location don't relate to today as least I found it difficult to understand I did not learn anything new that I did not know about Communism before I read it. So if you have a little time on your hands go ahead download and read it
3,A Piece of Inspiring but Sloppy Rhetoric,"This short and extremely influential document is the ideology that the USSR and communist China founded their governments upon. It is indeed incentiary writing about how the ""history of civilization is the history of class struggle"" and as capitalism continues to exploit the workers (the proletairat) and thereby widening the social gap between them and the upper-middle class (the burgiose), a revolution was inevitable. He proceeds to outline what this is going to look like and what the results will be. Unfortunately, he frequently indulges in questionable logic, incorrect assumptions and worst, an assuption that once the proletariat is in control, they'll want to give up their power eventually. Hah!"
5,"More applicable today, than ever before","The writing style is extremely easy to read for such a powerful work (unlike mill's 'on liberty' for example)While some of it has dated, the basic elements remain as powerful today and the closing paragraph of 'the manifesto' has to be seen to be believed !( one of the great quotes of the millenium is to be found there!!) As for some people's criticism of marx - responsible for millions of deaths and stalin,etc, these frankly are ludicrous(would these same people also blame christ for the inquisition,and countless holy wars?) Also bear in mind 'communist state' is a contradiction in terms, as outlined here, marx's idea of communism was the end result of a stateless, equal society in which solidarity would be an important element ( such an immoral and hateful proposition, ??)"
2,Ok,I'm only a young teen so many I went understand the book that we'll but I feel that it was in not the best but not the worst either. In like the middle of the book it got a little bit fuzzy... but like I said it was ok not great but ok
5,Not much has changed,"In all these years we are in the same place now that we were then, lords and serfs. Food for thought."
3,Communist Manifesto,A good short book describing in fine detail the goals and desires of communist government. So much of American society is influenced by communism
4,Must read - know thine enemy,"I highly recommend that anyone interested in world development read this book. Personally, I feel Communism poses the greatest threat this world has ever seen - recommending a charge toward soul-draining anarchy. However, in and of itself the book is valuable as an illustration of that map toward terror.Marx may indeed have been an eloquent and convincing speaker. These qualities come across in this work. But what is valuable to notice in actually reading this doctrine is that while Marx's grande plan for overturning the world and securing a new order, nowhere in the document is the future discussed. Repercussions, consequences, any vision regarding ""what happens next"" is absent. This key fact is what should be noted. By noting this element of the doomed-to-fail ideology, future generations can avoid being fooled by ""brave words,"" as Marx indeed cites of his very enemies.This book should be read. For, only by knowing thine enemy can that enemy be utterly defeated."
2,Historical Work,"Karl Marx is a paragon of Western civilization. That said, I want to say his ""Communist Manifesto"" is an interesting historical read so to understand critiques of the industrial revolution and the evils it effected. But I think the ideas taken together are today bankrupt due to better government and a lean toward the left in coopting some of the ideas of Marx. If you are interested in reading this book for historical purposes, I recommend it; if you want to read it for ideas about bettering our present condition, I would say you might be wasting your time. Great thinker nonetheless."
2,Take it for what it's worth,"All of Marx's theories have pretty much been disproven and denounced. This is a book that probably resulted in millions of deaths at the hands of Communist governments inspired by Marx. Its contemporary worth lies in understanding the mentality of communists and how we can prevent such far-fetched theories from materializing in the future. The content of this book is pretty much useless now, but its historical importance shouldnt be forgotten."
3,The only way to experience real change is through revolution...,Then the communists come in and pick up the pieces. This manifesto is still eye opening after 100 years. People seem to never change.
4,classic thought,"There is a lot more here than what was put into practice by the Soviet Block. I'd rather not accept the general rejection of Communist thought without being informed personally. It should be read by anyone interested in political thought and influences. This thinking is pretty much rejected and without expression in the United States, but it is alive and well in most of the rest of the world, most especially in many European countries."
3,The Sisyphus System.,"This book was great, easy to read yet deep in its application to modern time. It also shed light on the fact that wealth power and influence is guarded for the privilege few."
1,Good in theory,"Kinda a pointless book now that communism has been proven ineffective. I guess if you still want to live in this type of society you can move to Russa, China, Cuba etc. Lucky for them they have the US to give them foreign aid. Communism would be dead within a few decades without a capitolistic nation to support it."
1,Decepción,"Si nos olvidamos de que el autor es Gabriel Garcia Marquez, y suponemos que el libro lo escribiera un autor desconocido, la crítica seria implacable con el!. Un libro sin ingenio, aburrido, una historia absurda de un anciano que se enamora de una niña con la cual nunca ha hablado, y solo la ha visto dormir. En verdad, alta decepción este libro."
1,Dreadfully boring,"Even though it is less than 200 pages, this book drags on and on - seriously boring stuff. I think it was published for the heck of publishing and solely relying on the fact that the author's name will sell the book.I love GGM but this book made me feel like it should be the last of his written work. I rather read A Hundred Years of Solitude a hundred times, before I spend time reading newer material like this sad story about sad whores and bored old man. If you want to read stuff from Colombian authors written in the last 5 years, read Laura Restrepo, Efraim Medina, Mario Mendoza, Jorge Franco, etc."
3,I expected more,"I was so excited when I bought this book, but once I read it I was kind of disappointed, compared to his other books this one was not good at all. When you think about Memorias de mis putas tristes you think something totally different and the story just don't follow it's title as it supposed to."
2,Una gran desilusión,"Comencé la lectura de este libro con grandes expectativas. Al fin una novela de Garcia Marquez despues de tanto tiempo! Siento particular fascinación por su obra, tanto periodística como de ficción, porque hasta ""Memorias de mis putas tristes"" había encontrado cautivante su forma de relatar, su cadencia, como su prosa está llena de poesía.Como decía, hasta este libro. Sinceramente, lo encuentro el recuento tristemente cansador y aburrido de un viejo verde. Nada más.García Marquez tiene sin dudas talento para más, lástima que aquí no se nota."
1,No Pierdan Su Tiempo... Garcia Marquez at his worst,"Garcia Marquez es un escritor grandioso; un genio; un maestro. Este libro es, sin embargo, aburrido y simple. El tema del libro es interesante, pero GM se queda corto en su desarrollo. Referencias pobres, descripciones inutiles y protagonistas bochornosos. Antes de comprar este libro, compre cualquier otro de Garcia Marquez.Leer este libro produce el placer humano de poder observar a los grandes hombres en descenso (es como ver a Maradona jugar futbol, gordo, drogado y viejo). Depronto lo unico bueno del libro es que este parece escrito por su protagonista: un viejito que al cumplir los 90 afirma ""Nunca hice nada distinto de escribir, pero no tengo vocación de narrador...""Don't waste your time with this book! If you want to Read Garcia Marquez, buy pretty much any other book but this!"
1,mal libro para empezar,"talves este es un muy mal libro para empezar con este autor, tiene partes y enseñaszas interesantes pero nada mas haya...talves otro de sus grandes exitos me diga porque es tan famoso"
2,Tristemente corto.,"Me quedé con ganas de más, el libro es interesante pero sumamente corto para un autor del calibre de García Marquez."
2,Tema Trillado,"El hombre incapaz de hacerle amor a una ""bella durmiente"" como la virgen de esta novela es algo que ya vimos en ""La bella durmiente"" del libro de cuentos ""Cuentos peregrinos"", y en una escena en ""El general en su laberinto"". El protagonista de esta nueva novela también da eco al protagonista de ""El coronel no tiene quien le escriba"" (este tipo de continuidad de personajes no es tan descabellado: Gabo le dijo a Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza en ""El olor de al Guayaba"" que si Aureliano Buendía se hubiera quedado en el poder, se hubiera convertido en el protagonista de ""El otoño del Patriarca""; y las semejanzas entre Aureliano de ""Cien años..."" y el General de ""El general en su laberinto"" son importantes). Pero esta novela no me tocó porque me pareció una repetición menos inspirada de ficciones anteriores. Quizás para lectores menos familiares con estas obras anteriores, esta nueva novela pudiera parecer fresca. Francamente, lo dudo."
2,Falto de imaginacion,"Las comparaciones siempre son malas, aunque en ciertos casos son inevitables. Gabo dejo de la lado la imaginacion y nos dio una aburrida y facil historia. Sin muchos matices y muy directa sobre un viejo obsecionado por una nena de 14 anos. Vuelvan a leer los clasicos de Gabo y no se desilusionen."
4,Gabo sigue siendo Gabo...,"Si en este libro pretendes encontrar la sátira de Los Funerales de la Mamá Grande; la magia y complejidad de Cien Años de Soledad; el drama de Relato de un Náufrago; la determinación de El Amor en los Tiempos del Cólera; o la melancolía de Extraños Peregrinos: Doce Cuentos; te llevarás una gran desilusión. Pero en cambio, si tus ambiciones son mucho menores, y te dejas llevar ligeramente, sin prejuicios ni tapujos, a través de las breves líneas de este escrito, disfrutarás quizá de una de las historias de amor más sentidas, más profundas y más honestas, salidas de la pluma del creador de Macondo."
4,Short and Sweet,"This is the first time in Spanish, I have read Garcia Marquez. Reading many of Garcia Marquez's books in English, I was not fully aware of this writer's magical ability to transport the reader into a world of imagination and wonder. I purchased this book at the Acapulco airport on my return trip home and finished it on my flight. I was enthralled and appreciated his work even more than I had before. This author brings us to a world of disgust, love, and compassion but most of all he makes us to want more.Was it a short novel, a long poem? Who cares, just read it. Now I will read all his other novels again but this time in Spanish. I have missed out on so much!"
5,Great Book,This book is short but sweet. Relato de un hombre en sus noventa anios sobre sus amores (o falde de...) durante su larga vida dadose cuenta cuando al fin se enamoro de una prostituta virgen.
3,well written...that is about it.,"This book is well written, Garcia Marquez could do nothing else than good writing...but this book did not capture me. When I finished it I realized that I did learn some things and it made me think, but really it was not worth the crudeness in order to get there."
2,Still Garcia Marquez,"I have to tell you that I am a great admirer. I ve read a lot of his work. I didnt like this one particularly. The story line was flat, the characters were not developed the way he usually does. But still the beauty of his writting is impossible to ignore."
1,Nada buena...,"Ojala hubiese leído todas las malas reseñas que consiguió este libro antes de comprarlo. La historia del viejo que se enamora de una jovencita de 14 años me pareció sumamente absurda y hasta abusiva. La joven siempre estuvo dormida, o más bien anestesiada con algún brebaje, no creo que despierta hubiese aceptado estar con un hombre tan viejo. Durante todo el libro se nos quiere convencer de que la jovencita estaba de acuerdo con lo que estaba ocurriendo. El viejo solo se aprovecho de las circunstancias de la niña. La lectura fue una rápida y aburrida, no sentí simpatía por ninguno de los personajes. Realmente una desilusión leer algo de Gabriel García Márquez y no poder disfrutarlo."
5,Aventuras de un adulto mayor...,"Solo Garcia Marquez podria ser el autor de esta historia rica en lenguaje, aventura y desconcierto en un solo paquete! que ries te intrigas y te comes las uñas para pasar a la siguiente paginaun anciano al cumplir sus 90 años se enamora por primera vez en su vida! y pasa por todo lo que trae consigo un enamoramiento... esta fabulosa! una magnifica manera de inyectar vida a la bella edad de 90!Vale la pena leerla mas de una vez!"
4,Detrás de la sencillez de la Novela,"El esfuerzo de un premio nobel por volver a escribir con sencillez y accesibilidad. Una obra para disfrutarse en cada frase, donde se desnuda la irracionalidad del amor que no tiene que ver con el deseo desenfrendado. La expectativa de si el viejo va a tomar o no a la virgen, para al final saber que no es revelante, ya que tomó la ilusión y se acabó su ansiedad de amor, después de 90 años de no saber que la tenía. Las tonterias del viejo son las mismas de cualquier enamorado de 15, 30, 60 o 90 años."
2,Flying way off course,"Kitplanes has been around for quite a while, and used to be a source for information and how-to articles centered on the amateur builder. There was contagious excitement that encouraged readers to participate in their own projects, and the magazine nudged dreams ahead with construction and pilot reports that motivated builders to follow their dreams. A number of years, ago it changed its editor who changed its style --so that it focuses on glittery bits and pieces of sport aviation while only paying passing homage to the design and fabrication of grass roots aircraft building. I don't find it particularly compelling these days and think it appeals only to a small niche of readers. In a way, it's more of a vehicle for advertising rather than amateur aircraft construction."
4,A good solid book...,"There is a lot of 'meat' here - Ms. Godfrey has compiled a number of reports of ""Dogman"" sightings - ranging from the frankly unbelievable to the down right eerie. There is obviously a lot of research and effort here and Ms Godfrey deserves kudos for the on site personal interviews as well.After reading this book, I was left with the impression that there is something 'there' - that credible people are seeing 'something' - and Ms. Godfrey has done a good job bring their stories to light. I would definitely recommend this book to the interested reader."
3,The original was better,"I bought this toy for my daughter on her first birthday. As a kid, my brother had an older version of this toy and I was expecting that when I puchased the Chicco Animal Cottage. In that sense I was a little disappointed. The plastic is much thinner and flimsier, the doors pop open easily without using the key, and the animals can fit through some of the holes at the top meant for the shapes. That being said, it is still a fun toy and both my one and four year old enjoy playing with it."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I ordered this toy because my two year old had mastered his other shape sorters and I really liked the fine motor component the keys provide. However, upon receiving the toy I was a little let down. The reason being that the animals fit into the regular shape spaces. This means that a child can put the animals through the shape holes and since they fit, they think they've done the task correctly. This toy requires hands on for parents (which isn't a bad thing) so your child won't be able to play on his/her own without garnering a false sense of correctness. Also, the plastic locks are not very sturdy and seem as though they will break easily. I have seen older versions of this toy in other settings and they did not have this issue. So if you can find a used one at a garage sale buy it. If not, I would pass on this toy."
1,bad quality game,"i didn't like this toy at all ,,, very bad quality .. would not recommend it to anyone .. .."
4,a little challenging for small hands,"My two-year old grandson loves keys and latches so this seemed like a great toy for him. When we gave it to him, he say right down and started dropping all the shapes and animals into the slots but then ran into difficulty with the keys to open the doors. He could get the key in but struggled to turn it and open it at the same time; the latch does stay open. I am hoping with a little more practice (and patience with age) he will master the dexterity needed."
4,Great grandson likes this toy,I thought it was very cute and i am happy i bought it for him. He is two and has a very hard time if a toy doesn't keep him busy.
3,Fun but frustrating,"Our 2 year old has good fine motor skills but finds the keys too hard to use on this toy. She has lots of fun matching the shapes and colors, but we wish that the keys worked more easily."
4,Great Eloy album,"1994 album, couple of years after ' Destination'...with the band returning to a more 'Eloy' sound?Less heavy and more of that spaced,flowing keyboard/lyric mastery.The whole album is good from start to finish,as always!,with 'Day of crimson skies', 'Fatal illusion' and 'The last in line' the bomb tracks.The choir and the girls sing...still not sure how much they effect the song/sound,but if Frank likes it,who would argue?Lyrics are classic Eloy and move with the world environment/peace/love...always great and inspiring to me,and its interesting to see how they percieve and write about mankinds continuing radical abuse of his only true home,this planet!!Highly recommended to Eloy freaks anywhere...as iv`e said before 'buy them all'..."
2,Disappointing,"Well I bought this one on the back of the rave reviews (so far) collected here, to my huge disappointment! There is a reason why this band never struck it big...they are just a by-product of the classic 'Progressive' sound (whatever that means) you hear when you listen to Crimson, Yes, VDGG and the likes. Eloy, though technically accomplished, lack originality in their music (on track one they sound like Rush, on track two you hear a clear rip-off of Pink Floyd' s 'Shine on crazy diamond')as well as the ability to write some even remotely interesting lyrics. I just lost interest after three tracks, a record of sorts. So, for all you out there who are not already fans of this band, if you are into Rush, Crimson, Yes etc. etc. DO NOT BUY this cd or any other Eloy album! This stuff is not worthy of the rich German tradition of the Seventies (Can, Faust, Tangerine Dream and so on). Probably the worst German band after Triumvirat. Buyer beware."
3,What's with the quality?,"Carter's is known for quality items and that is indeed my experience...not sure what happened with this photo album. It looks somewhat cheap especially the paper inside. I have couple other albums like that from somebody else and they are MUCH better. The onesie on the front is cute though. It will do the job, but I am a little disappointed."
1,Title doesn't mean a thing,"Only 11 tracks, so much for the title, 25 #1 from 25 Years. These same tracks get re-cycles and re-cycled again and again.Stop this madness."
2,too close to a caricature,"Be advised that after 45 minutes of the movie my 8 year-old son and I gave up. Goodman seems to have been given the license to ""go for broke"" with a ""larger than life"" approach, that leaves little for the viewer to consider of Ruth's actual life. With the broadest of strokes, Goodman plays Ruth self-consciously; the mis-en-scenes are without any surprises and Hollywood-predictable.Too little was shown to give us the sense of Ruth-as-athlete and the milieu of early 20th century baseball, a fascinating story that awaited telling but missed the opportunity here."
4,The Babe,Got this as a Christmas gift for a very dear friend of mine. He mentioned it a year or so ago and forund it for a reasonable price.
3,"Interesting, but lacked historical accuracy","It was an interesting movie and it made me want to look up some of the facts about the movie. Despite the fact that there were several historical errors in the movie, it was a fun view. I would suggest to anyone who watches this movie to also read Wikipedia's biography of Babe Ruth."
3,Babe's back bit by bat...lol,"after seeing the fabulous Ken Burns series, hard to go back to artistic license land, but found the drama enlightening... so funny to see John hitting right handed and the bat hitting his back, ouch! have met a few incorrigble lads in this life and always a childhood trauma to blame so could relate to this aspect... couldn't believe that sick kid asked for 2 homers, geez, he can barely breathe let alone get greedy! Kelly looked abs beautiful and downplayed the glamour puss Ziegfield type, John turns in a mostly respectable performance and shows bigger than life presence, mainly due to largesse but personality as well... struggles with his concept of The Dream was inspiring and to see the 'take good care of the fellas' priority... recommend purchase for impact of early 20th century baseball, consequences of fame, compassion for orphans."
4,The Babe: More than a legend,"The casting of John Goodman was a masterstroke for this film. He provides great energy and the cuddly presence of Babe Ruth naturally.Ruth's generosity is well conveyed in this film. Whether it was a child ill in hospital or a teammate he was selfless when it came to giving.So many baseball records were set by Ruth, and for those fans that were lucky enough to see him play often witnessed history in the making.This film portrays Ruth as a baseball phenomenon and an at times decadent fun loving person, who liked to give.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Baseball Author"
1,horrible,"horrible, absurd, cartoonish, ridiculous. do not waste two hours of your life that you will never get back. if you know anything about baseball, or babe ruth, avoid this. the people who made this know nothing about baseball or the history of baseball. better to search out a documentary or read a book about babe ruth if you are interested in him. there are plenty out there to choose from."
5,Very great movie,"Babe was one of the best baseball movies that I've ever seen. It has a little of everything in this movie from funny to sad parts to really dramatic parts. Atleast that's what I remember from it, but I saw it back in 92 and haven't seen it yet. But anyway it was a great movie and really detailed about Babe Ruth's life so own this one today."
4,Best Baseball Flick,"Yes, I know it's not 100% accurate and whatnot but it's still a great movie. I think this movie goes best with HBO's DVD bio on Babe Ruth called ""The Life Behind The Legend"". There was nothing about baseball Ruth couldn't do and be outstanding at it."
1,Not 'cracked up' to holding coffee...,I've had these mugs for a short time (2-3 weeks) and 3 of the mugs have already cracked from the heat of the coffee that was poured into them. My coffee-maker doesn't even make particularly hot coffee so I couldn't imagine these mugs standing up to the heat of boiling water in tea.Buyer beware!!!
2,Fractured!,"We experienced a little breakage as well. The first mug to receive boiling water for tea cracked and fell apart. We were stubborn though. Liking the shape and the weight of the mugs, we decided that testing was in order. We placed the remaining mugs in the sink and filled them full of boiling water and then poured them out and thermal shocked them with cool tap water. Three times we applied this treatment. Total mug loss of 2 out of twelve. We decided the remaining mugs are safe and we are keeping them but be careful if you order this set."
4,Nice coffee mugs,"I've had these for a couple of months. None have broken or chipped.I with they didn't have the seam along the length of the handle. Its one of those little things that, once noticed, kind of grate on me."
4,"Just the right size for us, thanks.",Perfect for us. Good quality. We were looking for this size cup in this form for some time and we are vary happy with the cups.
1,Literally the worst Batman story I've ever read,"Do not buy this. Do not borrow this. Do not thumb through this at the book store. Do not even look in this book's direction.It's billed as a follow-up to the incredible Jeph Loeb/Jim Lee Batman story ""Hush."" Instead, it takes the character created by those visionaries and stomps it out, removing every unique aspect of the character and turning him into just another Batman villain.The cover art is bad. The interior art is average. The writing is horrendous.Not only does Lieberman ruin Hush, he completely misunderstands the character of the Joker.This is an abomination of a book. Read at your own peril."
2,Could have done without it.,"""Hush"" was a tremendous story and this sequel did not do it justice. This was like the Godfather III for me. Standing on it's own, probably not a bad job, but in comparison to its predecessors - completely inadequate."
1,Like it never happened...,"After reading the first Hush series, I was absolutely stoked to see Hush Returns on bookshelves. I picked it up immediately. The cover art left something to be desired(I'm very picky over comic art)and the inside artwork was about the same, good, but nothing special. I brought it home and read through it pretty quickly, at first it seemed pretty interesting, except for this whole weird storyline with the Joker(that ends in an extremely disappointing way). Page after page I was waiting for something awesome to happen, waiting for an amazing story like Batman: Hush, but no...nothing...and the comic community has felt the same way. In fact DC has brought Hush back recently with a new storyline and new devious plot and guess what? They acted as though Hush Returns never happened."
2,"Disappointing, muddled and not worth it","I was really, really let down by this volume. As a sequel to Hush (a good but a bit over-hyped story in itself), this had big shoes to fill. Unfortunately, this book is undone by a number of shortcomings. I really didn't care for the artwork, which is a bit naive and cartoonish and really doesn't suit the action. The story is a bit confused and muddled, and the Joker storyline is a rip-off/homage to Moore's ""The Killing Joke"". This was one of the weaker entries in the Batman library."
2,The only thing you need to know:,"Two words -- No resolution.Seriously, this graphic novel ends with no plot resolution at all. There is such a great buildup with absolutely no payoff. Do NOT waste your money on this. The only redeeming factor is the decent artwork. Beyond that, the storyline is atrocious."
3,the killing joke 1.5. . .,"This was an ""ok"" read...it wasnt bad, it wasnt good either. This is a FARCRY from the original HUSH novel which in my opinion is one the best batman stories ever told. Heres the problem: its uneventful. Nothing great ever happens, hush doesn't even show up that much. He shows up here and there and talks some senseless stuff and thats it. The ending sucked so much i cant even begin to tell you how disappointing it was. The only good thing about the novel is that it sort of ""expands"" Alan Moore's masterpiece ""The killing joke"" storyline. Other than that, unless you are a hardcore batman fan, avoid this."
5,i love all of it,"the cd is great I love all of the songs but my favorite ones are 'Black Widow Spider,Turning Cold and You're Gonna Cry and Roll Over'. He did a wonderful job on the whole cd. I love his voice. I can't wait to see what is on his next cd please email me when it comes out I want it. I give it a 10 star"
2,does not have the complete collection of stories from book,"I heard some of the stories over PBS years ago and decided to buy the collection. I am disappointed that the two tape set does not have the complete book as I was expecting. Some of the greater stories are left out. I have read ""The End of the Road"" hard cover and recommend it!"
5,5 stars for End of the Road!,This is by far my favorite Tom Bodett book. It's funny and puts you right there in the little town called End of the road. Fantastic book
1,Bad Bad Book,"This is a patheticly designed design book by David Dabner that shamefully claims is ""based on the best selling edition by Alan Swann"" NOT co-authored by Alan Swann as the Amazon listing claims. The original book by the same title, actually written by Alan Swann and was Published by North Light Books in 1987 and paperback 1990 is the bible for understanding graphic design! Nothing short of brilliant! Do NOT buy Dabner's book when you can buy the original by Swann"
2,Less than useful continued... (tip of the hat to David Chess),"This book disappoints in many ways. There are other books available on the topic of graphic design that are far more helpful, such as Robin Williams' ""The Non-Designer's Design Book"".The most logical place to start with a book on graphic design is with an introduction to the elements of design before then speaking of the principles of design. The book's first chapter is titled ""Basic Design Principles"" and confuses by mixing elements of design with principles of design.The layout of the book is uninspired. The pink horizontal hairlines on every page do nothing to improve the look of the book but are instead distracting. The one nice thing about this book is that the examples used are generally high quality design.This book does not deliver good value for money, especially considering the other graphic design books on the market."
5,The real Alan Swann,"Do not get the updated version of this book, it is terrible! This is the book, and find it while you can, it is the best book on design ever printed."
2,Lazy and lacking in explicitness,Please read David M. Chess's eloquent review of this poor-quality book. I intuitively felt much of what he was able to say with his obviously greater design education.
5,Excellent Format For Fluid Reading and Clear Learning,"I was looking for something more than a ""picture book"" as many publish today. This book delivers the goods! Both in design and syntax, the author brings the novice through the fundamental stages of creative pagination. Don't buy another graphic design book until you own and read this one. No beginning gdesigner should be without this on their bookshelf."
4,Book not for General Designers,"This book targets all Designers (Designers in Print, Packaging, Web Design...etc), so I would not suggest it if you are looking for a specific book about your choice of field in design. It is also not suitable for designers who knows the basics of design, because it talks a lot about elementary stuff. Generally it is a good, easy to read book with lots of examples and excercises."
2,For wealthy beginers only,"I found this book too simplistic and way overpriced. It provided little information that could not be found for free on the internet. Furthermore, references are made to specific products, which means that the programs can not be run without downloading (or buying) the demos (some of which are severly limited).It doesn't even have an index!"
1,Very simple minded,"I've been working on a lighting control program in visual basic that reads and writes to PLCs, and this book didn't give me any new ideas. It might be useful to someone who wanted to create an HMI interface but knew nothing about Visual Basic (or programming in general), but the project would have to be almost exactly like one of the examples in the book"
1,Unfortunate waste of money for me,"This book seems to be designed to sell specific equipment and software. It would cost well over $1,000 to get any benefit from it. I can't afford to waste the kind of money I paid for this book. It should have been more forthcoming in the Amazon intro to the book. Title is very misleading. A severe disappointment."
1,Not very helpful with the important stuff.,"Let's start with stating that I create HMI's/SCADA systems for a living. I have used all the major commercial software including Wonderware and iFIX. This book was interesting. But as far as I'm concerned it left out the most important information. The author wants you to use a demo version of the software that 'talks' with the PLC. For me it's the reading and writing to the PLC that is important. It talked about how to animate graphic, etc. But it didn't even cover 'good' practices. There really needs to be a section on serial or TCP/IP communications to really make it worth something long term. The driver you would have to buy to use this more than a fun activity cost about $1000."
4,Human machine,This book is very helpul for a beginner that want to explore the world of Automation step by step . I would be helpul have a disk enclosed with some examples and flow charts. Good reference book . I hope to see a new improved edition.
2,If you are looking a user manual for a comercial driver is OK,"this book is good to implement a project of HMI using a comercial driver, but dont take issues like comunication, desing a good HMI, the PLC Hardware.This is only an example of use a comercial driver to conect your Visual Basic project to a PLC, only teach how configurate the driver"
5,Great Workout,I've had this DVD for appx. a week now and I love it. She focuses on the abs and booty but I can actually feel it all over.
4,Turbo Jam Live booty Sculpt plus abs,Enjoy the tape. I like that it is 30 minutes long as my other turbo jam tapes are 20 or 40 minutes long. Good work out!
2,Not thrilled in the west,"It feels like the instructor leads as though viewers have been in her class all along. She is slow with some of the cues and they at times are difficult to understand. This may cause a person to miss several reps on one side. The group seems to want to appear so cool that they look silly at times, trying to incorporate their own little dance moves in between the exercises. They look like they are trying to out do each other. It's annoying. Just focus and exercise please. If I want to see a dance contest, I can go to a club. The woman who is doing the modified version doesn't always keep it modified. The best part is the short portion of floor exercises for abs. Throughout the dvd, the mom of 7 looks fantastic and has great form as she works out. She's focused, which could be why she looks more fit than most everyone else. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have purchased this video."
3,"Abs great, other ok",I use the abs part when I do the lower body jam dvd. Great to have for that but the other part of this workout is too sedate.
3,A guilty pleasure,"This is the type of band thats a guilty pleasure. Most young kids don't realize that these bands today are inferior to the earlier bands of the 90's. Don't get me wrong, there are still a lot of excellent bands out there, but everybodys a sell out today. This is a good album."
1,A new low - even for them.,"First off - punk's dead. Don't call any of these dorks punk. That aside, this album is so derivative of other bands that I had to come here to see if anybody else feels the same. I got this CD for my daughter, who likes it because it ""sounds like the Killers and Coldplay."" Is this the same bunch of emo geeks who used to wear ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" t-shirts and have black lips? You poor, young mugs."
2,Could be better,I should have just bought the songs i wanted. Most of the songs aren't that great. I know this buy was a waste. I suggest you just buy the songs your interested in.
3,"Not Great, Not Bad, Not Impressed","I have to laugh at some of the pubescent reviews. Many of them can be summed up as: ""I hate it when a band plays music I don't want to hear."" Really?!?Lots of bands shift, evolve and change, often leaving many narrow-minded fans stranded on their limited islands. I'm remembering the grief the Goo Goo Dolls suffered when they did something similar and favored mainstream more than limited crowds.The Good: Album is polished and well-done. Very approachable. Small glimpse are present of potential, but otherwise never reached. Nice to listen to if you want some pop-punk background while working, but don't have the time to pay attention to lyrics and music.The Bad: Loss of the edginess and core appeal they had. Lyrics are basically lame. Not blazing any new musical ground, although it is a shift for the band itself.Similarities: Goo Goo Dolls, The Killers, Coldplay.In the end, would I buy this again armed with what I know now? No."
3,Long Time Fan,"I really loved the first album. It was a lot of fun, upbeat and really rocked in spots. The Chronicles album was just terrible for me. I'm all for change, but the album just didn't have the energy. With a name like Good Morning Revival I was hoping for a return to the roots of their music. Sadly I don't think this does. The songs are flat and have non of the pop punk energy. I don't hear any stand out singles that will hit the radio and propel this one to big sales. Hopefully if this one does worse than the last, the band will realize what people really want to hear from them. I really want to stay a fan."
1,What a waste of money!!,"I hate saying this as a HUGE Good Charlotte fan but their new album is just a major waste of money. Their first album is one of my top five albums of all time, but this one sucks. The songs are all dance pop synthesized junk. No real guitars, no messages to any of the songs, no nothing. I dont know if Joel is just too busy running around town with Nicole Richie or what but they skipped out on this album. The only redeaming song is The River, on which they colaberated with M Shadows and Synester Gates of Avenged Sevenfold. I hate hate hate to say it but dont waste your money or time on this one, just listen to the first album and remember what a great band they used to be."
3,Good Charlotte Morning Revival,"I'm not a huge fan of Good Charlotte. Still this is a decent album. Most the songs are good enough for back round music. Their single ""Dance Floor"" is enjoyable."
3,what happened?,Im a long time fine of GC but chronicles and this dont come anywhere near the level of young and the hopeless. i accept change but this change was for the worse.
1,Ridiculous,"If I could give this no stars, I would. I loved the first album, I saw the video for Little Things on mtv2 and went out the next day and bought the CD. They had emotional lyrics and it was real. Second album was fun, slightly less personal. I loved Chronicles, I have both- the Life and Death versions. Chronicles had the best lyrics of all, I loved every track. So,I bought GMR the day it came out and it's the worst album I own. It ruined listening to the other albums for me. Joel doesn't even really sing - he sounds like he's trying to sing but it comes out like he's talking and has a cold. The lyrics are are awful, no emotion or personal feelings. They are all about the same things.If you still feel like you want to buy this album, you should read the lyrics for all the songs and see for yourself.But my advice - check out other bands who actually care about their fans.I will never buy another GC album and I threw away my old ones."
2,I'll Pass...,"So I've been a fan of Good Charlotte and have always loved their cds.When I got ""Good Morning Revival"" I expected another great album... Not what I got. The entire thing was just too mainstream for me. It sounded too poppy and like they sold out. BLAND.The only tracks I can enjoy are ""The River"" (Basically because of M. Shadows and Synyster Gates) and ""Don't Wanna Be In Love (Dance Floor Anthem)"" since its a great song to dance to. And ""Breaking Apart Her Heart"" it holds some shread of their old sound. Otherwise the others sound so poppy and diffent to what I am used to hearing from them. Like what the tags say it is trl trash.If they wanted to go in a different direction with this cd then they succeeded."
4,People are just impossible to please.,"I don't even really listen to Good Charlotte (their style isnt my cup of tea) but I figured I would give this album a shot since I liked their single The River.....and I was right to take that shot. The first 7 songs on this album are solid...lyrics are nothing to right home about, but they get the job done...the music is definitely a step up from their previous efforts....I really dont know what people expect anymore....I think they expect too much, especially from bands like Good Charlotte."
4,My favorite from these guys.,"This is my favorite from Good Charlotte.I wasn't a real big fan of their first two albums cause they sounded like any other pop-punk band.But I was hooked after I heard Chronicles.(If you want to know I bought the death version cause I liked it's bonus song way better than lifes.)Also on that note I like to say who gives a [...] if they made a song about how rich they were.I mean why did you buy it if you didn't like it.My favorite tracks areThe River,Misery,Something Else,and All black."
2,Not much fun indeed,"There's some absolutely stunning music to be found on this 2-disc dvd set. Unfortunally the editing and footage is sub-par which makes for a non satisfactory viewing experience. But the audio is great. A dvd to listen to, not watch."
3,"At critical moments, difficult to grasp","When Mariani gets deep into discussion of particular poems, his language often becomes so compressed and allusive that it reads like a diary of Mariani's own history with Crane's poetry. And like many diaries, it is simply not understandable to an outsider.I expect that Mariani does not want to reduce the richness and complexity of Crane's work, and this is admirable. I also think that perhaps he expects his readers to have read at least one of the earlier biographies of Crane. And perhaps an English Ph.D. would follow more of Mariani's un-explicated allusions than I did (though I have done some graduate work in English). But I was often frustrated by this book, because while Mariani clearly knows a great deal about Crane's work and its literary and biographical contexts, he often fails to explain what he knows in a way that can be understood."
4,"Excellent overall, flaws underfoot","I had read the author's biography of John Berryman and enjoyed it, although I never could find the house Berryman was to have lived in when he taught at the University of Cincinnati. This biography was also very enjoyable and despite Crane's alcoholic behavior and excuse-making I was able to feel sorry for him. But there were a few ""facts"" reported that can't be right - H.P. Lovecraft a Cleveland native! And Harry Crosby was 7 years younger than his wife, not older. Crosby was in his early 30's when he died, he wasn't 40 years old when he met Crane. Minor, I know but they cause me to wonder - is anything else wrong?"
1,Not as good as before,"I purchased a HON chair a few years ago, it was great. I ordered this one thinking it would be as good. But I was wrong. The seat was too high at its lowest position even for a tall guy over 6'. The seat cushion was too hard to sit even for a few minutes. So it would not be good to sit for a long time. I returned this item. But was charged $60.00 for shipping."
3,Very Interesting,"Lots of useful info on Rickenbacker guitars, but I was disappointed that there was no information of Rickenbacker Electric Basses"
1,Lost respect,"I used to really enjoy enigma until they stole the voices of the Kuo Couple of the Ami tribe in Taiwan. The success of the single Return to Innocence is completely due to these vocals not to enigma's own ""originality"" and it sickens me that they tried to take credit for this beautiful work. And yes I am Taiwanese so I was and am still angered by this lack of respect towards other cultures. This shows their ignorance and disregard to other cultures since they tried to pass the vocals off as ""native american."" To me, this sounds like theyre saying ""All natives are alike so why does it matter whether or not we credit the right ones.""I can no longer listen to anymore Enigma songs without thinking of this total violation of the rights of two amazing people."
5,always excellent,The sounds and musical experience of Enigma is unique to just about any other music experience ... it's mesmerizing and wants to make you listen to it over and over.
2,Disappointing!,"Despite Mr. Moeller's ""brand-name appeal"", I must confess I found this book disappointing. The title promises too much perhaps; how can mere 300 pages cover the matter for a practitioner? Written in an informal style, it paints on a broad canvas -- the kind of material that would do well for an after dinner-talk for auditors, but most definitely lacks depth and specificity. It could be useful for students or business managers, but is unlikely to help a professional auditor much.Browse through it first to see if it answers your needs before putting down your money."
3,Sarbanes-Oxley and the New Internal Auditing Rules,"This book provides a comprehensive overall view on Sarbanes Oxley and other evolving internal audit standards and practices. Moeller has taken an extended view on the roles of internal auditor to include that of quality auditors for ASQ and ISO.I find the book useful for general knowledge on what internal audit entails. However, this book has its limitation for practising internal auditors who are seeking in depth working tools to meet their professional requirements."
5,Easy and Enjoyable Listening!,I love the simplicity of the piano by itself. The arrangements are beautiful and not overplayed. Song selection on this CD may not be to everyone's liking but this artist has several other CDs to choose from.
5,Songs of the South and others,We have all of Mr. Gibson's CD's and eagerly await more. His improvisations are spectacularly well done and are such a listening pleasure. Highly recommended.
2,Don't bother!,"Mr Tocci was a high school science teacher and writes about people with Down syndrome as though they were science projects. He does not bother to identify any people pictured in the book, just labels them as specimens, eg ""a young person with DS enjoys time with friends"" I realize the book was written for young people and that the language is simplistic but he also has his facts wrong. Down syndrome is not an inherited condition. I think that the author means well which is why I have stretched to 2 stars. He has covered the topic thoroughly. He speaks about treating people with Down syndrome as individuals yet through his writing style he does just the opposite. Generalizations abound in this book. I would avoid it as there are many better available."
5,thank you,great cd great condition great songs love that i was able to find this item at such a great price.
4,Great CD,I Will Follow Him is a fabulous song. That's the one I listen to over and over again. The quality of the recording is excellent.
5,the best movie soundtrack I ever heard.,I saw the movie and it was terrific and I couldn't wait to buy the soundtrack. You all will like it. Hope you get it.
5,One Of The Best From 70s Scandanavia,"1972 release by one of the best Scandinavian bands of the 70s. With Englishman Cy Nicklin on lead vocals and the band's mix of potent west coast flavored heavy rock, prog and harmony folk this album follows on from their strong debut in a more relaxed style."
3,Dont bother with this version of the album!,"As I listened to this version of the album, many of the songs seemed to be of inferior quality in comparison with the songs on the original version of this album. Secondly, rather than having to hear twenty minutes of Jonathan King's egotistical claptrap, I would have preferred to hear an interview of the musicians in the band. Dont bother buying this version. Instead buy the original album with the black cover with gold lettering!"
3,A Good Start,"Considering the fact that they were between 16 and 17 years old when they recorded this album, and despite the posthumus addition of strings at every turn this recording holds up. From Genesis To Revelation provides an interesting glimpse at what would come later. Songs like ""Am I Very Wrong?"" and ""In Hiding"" serve as pre-cursors to ""Stagnation"" (Trespass) and 'Musical Box"" (Nursery Cryme). Also of note is ""One Eyed Hound"" with it's Hendrix like guitar, and it's ""Counting Out Time""(Lamb Lies Down On Broadway) like humour. Oddly enough this recording is at it's best once you've plumbed the depths of the afformentioned later efforts by Genesis."
4,In The Beginning...,"""From Genesis To Revelation"" is the first of a long line of albums from a gifted and talented group of musicians known as Genesis. The music on this CD can be described as a cross between early The Moody Blues and early The Bee Gees. The music on FGTR is easy listening throughout, and has pleasant tracks like ""Am I Very Wrong, ""The Conquerer"", ""One Day"", ""In Hiding"", ""A Place To Call My Own"" and ""The Silent Sun"", which was Genesis' first single released in Britain. Not bad for a group's first album. FGTR is produced by Johnathan King, who had a hit with ""Everyone's Gone To The Moon"" in 1965. The members of Genesis at the time of FGTR were students at London's famous Charterhouse School, and graduated soon afterward. Personnel and managerial changes would develop by the time Genesis started work on their second album, ""Trespass."" FGTR is a nice collection of songs for any Genesis fan to have in their repertoire."
1,"Awful product, don't bother","I write very few reviews, but I felt I had to for these bowls. I bought a set of these a while ago, and they really look nice when you get them. But boy do they stain easily, and I've tried soaking them in undiluted bleach with no luck. But worse than that, after about a year or so, the three largest bowls had all developed cracks, and finally just now the largest one cracked completely thru, and dibbled water all over the place. I came back to Amazon to find another set of mixing bowls to replace these, but I figured I might as well give these the bad review they deserve while I'm here. This is a poorly designed product, and I'd suggest you go find something else. Sorry, Mario, but you blew it on this one."
3,"Convenient package, but poor quality","This is a great package in terms of the selection of bowl sizes for the price. Unfortunately, they compensated with poor quality.Within the first year of owning these bowls, the rubber bottoms come off most of them; I had to super glue them back on. Over the next 18 months, three of the bowls broke after short drops. The problem seems to be that, over time, running the bowls through the dishwasher causes the rubber bottoms to expand and the plastic of the bowl to weaken.So, I would consider buying these again only because they're not that expensive for a complete set and I haven't found anything similar. But my expectation would be that they will only last me a couple of years before they need to be replaced again."
4,Pretty Good,"This is very good. You can pick which workouts you have time to do... or do them all! They use water bottles for the workouts(I use my weights) & you feel really good afterward. Not too repetitive, but good work outs to keep you toned fit & feeling good. There is variety in the workouts so that bored, oh-no-not-that-again urge doesnt come up when watching this DVD. Recommended!"
1,stunningly dull,"As good as the Dave Marsh book ""Before I Get Old"" was, is as bad as this book is. Even the great subject could not hold my interest. I am embarassed to own it."
3,Behind....What I should have left this book,"I don't know what I expected from this book. Perhaps I was looking for the tell all book of the Who that filled me in on all of the details that I didn't already know about the band, and really get into the shoes of one of the greatest musicians alive. It didn't happen for me with this book. Yes, there were things that I learned about Townsend, and The Who, but there wasn't enough interesting things to fill a whole book in my opinion. After this book I was not left with any overwhelming feeling of WOW! That was great, or, WOW! I learned a lot from this book. It covered the basics, but to me, never really went into things with much detail. I didn't find myself glued to the book except for a very few parts. I'd almost say I found it boring, but it wasn't quite that bad. I was left thinking that there must be better books about the Who and Pete than this one. If I were you, I'd look for those ones."
1,A Waste of Time,"Charmed by seeing the Who's phenomenal performance in the dull dull dull Rolling Stones Rock n Roll Circus, I bought this book. I wish I had read these reviews before I bothered. The chronology is muddled, the author spends far too much time on his own involvement with Townsend, and we learn too much about the drivel Townsend churned out later in his career. Not enough about the early days. Read Dave Davies' and Ray Davies' brilliant books. They hide nothing."
3,I skipped over much of it,"As a Townshend fan, I was disappointed at the way this book was written. Too much about Meher Baba, the chapters on The Who years were too short, and the chapters on Townshend's solo career were too long. I have yet to find a good bio on The Who. ""Maximum R & B"" is a fantastic illustrated history, but ""Before I Get Old"" analyzes too much minutiae to the point of boredom. This book, however, is better than nothing."
1,"Awful, simpering folly of a ""book""","For the life of me, the part in this very catty biography where the author showed up with a gracious invitation to stay with Pete Townshend at Oceanic and then STOLE THE MASTER REELS OF TOMMY (!) should have been cause enough to use this book as kindling. I do NOT think anyone should waste their time with this book-ever."
1,Another Giuliano turkey.,"Not content with ruining the reputations of most of the Fab Four,Giuliano has moved on to Pete Townshend.Poor Pete.For all of his flaws,he deserves a lot better than this poorly written book."
2,there was nothing that stuck out-nothing new,"Giuliano focused too much on one aspect of townshend's life. Although the spirituality of pt is important, much else was left out. This should not have beent the running theme of the book. A big disappointment for a much awaited bio."
2,I really wanted to like it.,"My main problem with the book was this: we find that the author stole some tapes while on the payroll of Mr. Townshend. From that point on, the book takes on a very smarmy feel, and to me, ends up sounding like he is trying to get himself back into Peter Townshend's good graces. The stuff on the early years, childhood, etc, was interesting, some new stuff on the Who's beginning (although better covered in Kieth Moon bio). Overall a disappointment to a long standing Townshend/Who fan. You can still learn more about the subject from listening to his music."
3,"A flawed book, but a good subject.","There were some things the author wrote about that I didn't know like what his childhood was like, his relationship with his parents, etc. Also, there are some insights into the way he was during the '70s. The author does fawn over him a bit too much and a lot of the stories are rehashes, but since Townshend is such a difficult subject, I doubt any other writer would have better luck."
3,Could have been better....,"With no insult ment tward Giuliano (you did better than i could have ever done) this book isn't as great as I hoped for. It basically goes over the life of Townshend, and the Who, nothing that I didn't know in the first place. Anyone who is a newcomer to the Who's or Pete Townshend's music, I would recommend this, for it gives a great background to the Townshend's music and spirituality. . .but to those advanced Who fans, if you know who Colin Dawson is, you don't need to read this book. I strongly recommend Horse's Neck, by Townshend himself for the obsessed Who fan."
2,A Disappointing Life,"I am a 30+ year fan of Pete Townshend's, but after reading this book I have removed all his music from my iPod.Whether the information in this book is accurate or not, Pete appears to be nothing I had previously thought him to be. Through this book he appears to be an ego maniac, with heavy gluttonous tendencies. This goes from his sexual ambiguous exploits, to drugs, alcohol etc. And through it all, his poor wife and daughters were un-ware to a full degree regarding what he was up to. So sad, and what a waste of a life.Now when I listen to his lyrics, it is evident they are juvenile in their tone. His music is good, but his ego behind his lyrics is a now an apparent joke to me.In short, after reading this book, it is apparent that Mr. Townshend's life is a big Disappointment."
5,My lashes are tiny and this REALLY works!,"I have really small eye lashes. I have tried numerous mascaras to boost my volume with no luck until I tried LashFusion by Beauty Fusion. I was hesitant to spend the money, but it REALLY does work. My lashes were noticably bigger and bolder. Over time I noticed increased growth and length. I would highly recommend this product."
2,NOT worth the money,I was hoping for something that would last all day and give my lashes some well-needed umph. I am blonde and my lashes are thin and short. This did NOT do the job. It clumped (even though it says it won't) and by the end of the day left a shadow below my lower lashes (even though I don't put mascara on my lower lashes). This is not the worst mascara I have ever used which is why I gave it two stars but it is definitely NOT worth the high price tag.
1,who saves us from deconstruction?,"While his previous work revealed many interesting facts about ELT, Pennycook's post-modern ideology leads to disaster in ""Critical Applied Linguistics"". Indeed, the book's structure is so postmodern that there is hardly any frame left for reader to cling to. The only overarching structure is Pennycook's construction of the four schools of applied linguistics and this classification is extremely questionable. Often one scholar is taken as representing a whole school. In the case of Widdowson, his argument is misrepresented to suit the construction of ""liberal ostricism"".But the basic fallacy of the book is Pennycook's attitude towards research.Pennycook argues that, as objectivity is not possible, there is no need to try to be objective. While it is certainly true that notions such as ""objectivity"" and ""rationalism"" are often biased, the answer is not to discharge these notions but to use them while being aware of their problematic nature."
2,German English,"Great music; and as the other review say; pink floyd, Camel, Alan Parson lovers will enjoy this stuff. But the singing; ah the singing is a kill to all the music on this album. Those guys speak broken english and sing IN ENGLISH. I say stay away from this one and go for ""The power and the Passion"" Instead."
2,Cute but Pointless,"About two-thirds of this campily illustrated and ultimately light-weight book consists of inspirational essays on the girliness of traditionally female tasks such as gardening, decorating, cooking, and entertaining. In this vein, the odd ""helpful hint"" tells us to sew tassels to our curtains, toast bread crumbs atop our packaged mac-and-cheese, and hold gardening parties in our least-loved bridesmaid dresses. Oh, and let's not forget painting the garden tools pink with polka-dots!Some of the advice conflicts. On page 25, we're told that Elsie de Wolfe believed in ""plenty of optimism and white paint!"" Ten pages later, we're told we mustn't have white walls at all -- so boring! Who's right?This book seems destined to be given as going-to-college and thanks-for-wearing-an-ugly-bridesmaid-dress gifts, due to its high cuteness quotient. As useful housekeeping advice, forget it."
3,A few Good Recipies but not quite as good as I expected.,I saw this on the Q shopping channel. So I came to Amazon to get it at a much better price. I'm glad I spent less. It is worth it for a bout 5 recipies that are really great.I cannot say the stories are all that great of the author and her friends. Think you had to be there. Not always in the best taste.Still it is worth the recipies.
4,great gift for all your female friends,"I love this book. The recipes are great! I have given to many friends. It's a wonderful hostess gift, birthday gift, or holiday gift, no size guessing involved. Everyone whom I gave it to has given it rave reviews and it's a book they actually use! The recipes are simple and quick. You know you've picked a winner when the person calls and asks if you tried a particular recipe yet because they have and love it. Also great for the single young lady with little cooking experience."
4,Useful reference tool,"The ""in an instant"" series of books appear to be geared towards people who know what they want to do with a particular tool but just can't remember how to do it. I really like the style since, as the cover suggests, it's ""fast, focused and visual"".I would highly recommend this book to anyone. Besides, for the price, it's probably the cheapest Dreamweaver book on the market."
5,Forever After,"This the first title by Ms. Ford that I read years ago in paperback. I have been a loyal fan of her since then. The story of Charles and Diane was well written and hot, hot, hot! Every woman wants a man like Charles! Purchased kindle edition to re-read again and again......"
5,I loved it!!,"This was my very first novel by Ford and for my first reading of her work I was blown away! I love her writing style. Ford is up there with my favorites. Characters that anyone can fall in love with. I loved the storyline. Diana and Charles are hot together. Get a load of those love scenes! A must, must, must read!!Much love Ford!"
5,Warmth and sensitivity galoure in ForeverAfter,"Bette Ford's writing is heartfelt and dear it touched my soul caused an awakening of my spirit and mind and at times left me shell shocked and speechless and coming from a 22 year old college kid thats hard to believe sometimes that we guys can be that sensitive but she truely touched me in ways and places that I have never been touched before and so in real life for this I thank you and will for always consider you and hold you in the deepest depths of my thanks, appreciation and praise may God continue to Bless you with a mind so creative and so inspiring, with the best of wishes and always the best intentions Calvin C. Felton Jr."
1,JUST DIFFERENT,"THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK I READ FROM THIS AUTHOR AND IT MIGHT BE THE LAST... I'M STILL THINKING, IF I SHOULD PURCHASE ANOTHER BOOK...FOR ONE THE LEAD GUY SUCKS 1.THEY WERE NOT IN A RELATIONSHIP BUT HE LEFT HIS JOB BECAUSE HE THOUGHT SHE WAS SLEEPING WITH MEN..2.HE WAS SUPER RUDE TO HER FOR NO REASON...3 HE WAS UPSSET BECAUSE SHE WAS A VIRGIN REALLY 4.HE WAS UPSET ABOUT HER NOT OPENING UP ABOUT HER CHILDHOOD..I DID NOT FEEL THE CHEMISTRY THE SEX SCENES WAS LACKING IT WAS JUST BLAH"
2,So so.,"It worked fine for a while, but suddenly was out of focus and couldn't be fixed. The customer service and warranty department did nothing. I wouldn't recommend the product."
4,Very good value and attractive,"Handsome and good at their job. Dishwasher safe, sturdy. After six months of carniverous use we are very pleased."
4,Get what you pay for,"These knives are cheap both in price and quality, not the sharpest either. However, for the price they are much better than anything you will find in a department store. If you are looking for fine Japanese cutlery ($180.00 per set of four) you will be disappointed. If you are looking for inexpensive, these are the best steak knives you will find at this price!"
5,Does exactly what it's intended to do,"I bought this after seeing a nail art idea on pinterest done by punching hearts into tape to stencil the nail. Punches out perfect little hearts, even on tape. Yay! Great buy."
3,Works fine...,"The item itself works just fine. The only problem is that it was incorrectly packaged. Instead of a heart, it's a regular circle punch. I would return it for the correct one, but since it was so cheap, I'm just going to keep it.In addition, I don't want to deal with having to ship it back and wait for a new one."
4,Quick shipment,Received item fairly quickly after ordering. Only problem was that the heart is more like 1/8 inch instead of 1/4--smaller than I expected!
3,Too small,"Handle is easy to use, but heart size is so tiny that i had trouble lifting them and adhere them to paper without messing everything up."
1,dissapointed :(,"extremly dissapointed, not in the quality (although it is not briliant too...) but on the package itself. i really needed the heart shaped punch, and wayted for it for 2 weeks, and when i finally got it... it was a star punch. I can't even return it, cause i got it delivered to another country... very very dissaponted. if i needed the star shaped one, i would buy it :( blah :("
1,Mix Up,"I ordered the heart hole punch and received it fairly quickly. The package even said heart punch but when i opened it and used it, it just punched regular holes. I couldn't return it because i had already opened the package. The package was very deceiving. Not happy with my purchase!"
3,Thought Fiskars were more durable,"Did not hold up very well. Very disapointed in the product. Lasted about 2 weeks. I thought the name stood for ""well made product"""
4,Interesting writing style,The book reads almost like free verse poetry or prose ... I am not sure how well that added to the readng experience but it made for an enjoyable journey through the pages.
5,The Aggression Is So Live,"Here it is..for the first time i can listen the live cd from heavy metal band from start to finish. What i feel when i listen it is i couldnt stop bangin my head though i try to stop it. The energy so live..you just feel it if you dont see it..i am not say that i am as diehard LOG's fan, i say it what i feel when i listen to it.This cd is cool..the sound of the instrument is so real..clear and good production..i cant' say it anymore...just buy it,and this is new stand of the next heavy metal generation and come from Richmond Virginia..This The Real New Wave Of American Heavy Metal..If someone out there know about guy from Lamb Of God please tell them there is diehard fan from Indonesia waiting for their asaault in his country for the rest of his life...STAY METAL"
1,Too many snippits,"I was excited to find this book as a possible text for a course I co-facilitate in a group of retirees. We had read some short stories by Simone de Beauvoir, and she is listed as one of the authors in this compendium. And I remember Wayne Booth's work from my graduate school days. I am very disappointed to find that the book does not include short stories as I had expected, but rather short (very short) passages from some of the major authors. For example, of the four pages devoted to Beckett, 2 are ABOUT Beckett and the other is a very very short work, but at least it appears to be entire. Simone de Beauvoir doesn't fare any better. There is a lot of poetry, which is OK, but doesn't really fit into what we have covered in this class over the past 2 1/2 years. This one is going straight to my library donation pile."
4,does it have to be writing and must it be done in paris?,"I must admit to purchasing this because Danny Gregory did some of the illustrations. That said, as I read I became intrigued with what I could learn about my own compulsion, and sometimes strong commitment, to painting. Although the star of this show seems to be Paris, the lessons about turning away from other preoccupations and just getting to it, no matter where you are, can be applied to any location. Instilling discipline in a routine, albeit one that is wrapped in time and self-permission, is a strong central message. I liked the practicality of many suggestions and the devil-may-care attitude of others."
1,Great Expectations--Dashed,"I was foolish enough to purchase a book that, apparently, only the ""girls""--mea culpa, feminists--found so enthralling. And I purchased copies for two friends whom I'd taken to Paris for their first time. (My first time was while I was on a 72-hour leave from the front, Feb. '45.) I purchased it so that these delightful ladies could relive that experience. but what did I get, a guidebook for tyros. If anyone expects to find inspiration--my friends won't--to do some writing by buying this book as a guide, caveat emptor. Flaubert, Hem, Henry Miller (omitted) must be rolling over in their graves. (NB. For the poor visioned, the type is miserable. Shame on Writers Digest Books)And I had to pay full bore--before I discovered you could get a ""used' copy for 50 cents--which is all that great work is worth."
5,Wow! Wished I would have thought of using these a long time ago!,"Not sure what folks are talking about when posting negative anything about these underbed carts. They put together easily, and the quality is just fine. It's perfect for storing stuff under the bed. And the biggest feature that I like, is that it allows air circulation so my stuff doesn't get musty in this ocean community air!"
3,OKAY is all i can say,"First off I didn't expect much, so it met my expectations. The price matches the quality but its still very usable. If youre expecting high quality this isnt it for you. If you need a cheap fix for storage, then you might want to consider this."
4,Good product,"This cart is just what I was looking for. Fits nicely under my twin size bed. Easy storage for sweaters and small stuff. Easy to put together. Not great if looking for a ""super sturdy"" container but great for simple things."
5,"Liked it so much,buying another!","I bought 2 different underbed storage items to try and I really liked the convenience of this. We just got rid of our platform bed that had drawers so we definitely needed something more to put clothes in and hide away. This works great! It is the perfect height for sliding under our queen bed and I can easily fit 2 on one side. I'm getting the second one today.I am currently using it for shirts. I put a ton of tanks, tees, and camis in it and was pleasantly surprised at how much fit in there. I would imagine you could use it to store just about anything you want. Great buy!"
2,Pain in the butt,i purchased this to put my sons shoes on and put under his crib. I cant say how it holds up because i cant put it together i cant get the screws to screw in :( now ill have to wait to have my boyfriend try to put it together for me
3,Eh,"For the quality of this item, it may be a bit overpriced. I am, however, finding it to be useful as long as I move it slowly and carefully. It is currently allowing us to store our baby's cloth diaper supply under our bed and out of the way, which is nice. It was too high to roll under the crib. Our bed is on risers, so I can't speak to how well it would roll under a bed that is situated directly on the floor. I found that it was very fast and easy to assemble... I did it on my own in about 10 minutes. Time will tell if it holds up."
3,Mixed feelings,"I really like this product. It fits great under my bed. But it is a huge pain in the neck to put it together. You need to have the Incredible Hulk or Superman with you to get the screws into the holes. It doesn't come with tools. You need to use your own screwdriver. The holes are smaller than the screws and it is cheaply made. Therefore, it takes a lot of elbow grease to get them to go into the hole. You have to do this with 8 screws. However, once I was finished, I was able to fit my laptop, my Silhouette Cutting Machine, and several stacks of 12 x 12 scrapbook paper inside it and it holds everything very well. I recommend this product, as long as you are aware that you'll need a good amount of elbow grease to put it together."
3,Worked well to hold shoes under the bed,"Worked well to store shoes, too flimsy to hold anything heavier.Easy to assemble.Wheels work nicely (hammer them all the way in, they won't come out again)Check your bed height carefully, consider if the drawer wheels are going from hardwood under the bed to a carpetThe floor peices are not secured, I used zip ties to hold them in place (design flaw).Did fulfill the need."
1,Seriously bad.,"These carts are terrible. I should've listened to the reviews. The quality is shoddy, these should cost about $2.99 and be carried at the dollar store. They are frustrating to put together and once together, seem as delicate as egg shells. Don't buy!"
4,Easy Storage,"The carts were very simple to put together. It took us about 20 minutes to put 4 of them together. They roll in and out fine, and clear the underneath of the bed with room to spare.It was instantly obvious that the carts are not intended for heavy items. The contruction is very basic and sags in the middle if you put large/heavy items in them.They are perfect for storing clothing under the bed. I also have my younger kids toys in them - and they hold quite well.For the price, these are a great purchase if you are looking for quick access to your stored items.If you are looking for something durable or protective, this may not be what you are looking for. For example, when my kids pull the carts out to get toys, they automatically want to climb in the cart and it falls apart. But it does go back together easily after that.Also, I might add that the wheels are okay. So when they roll on moderately thick carpet I am not sure that they are superior to a plastic tub without wheels."
1,Better off with a cardboard box,"Very unstable construction, the wheels are not fixed and fall off every time I try to move it. They also don't turn and drag on the floor. Awful quality - you'd be better of making a drawer out of a cardboard box"
3,It works,THE PRO'S1. Takes around 5-8 minutes to put together2. Easy to move on hardwood floors3. The cart is well-sized and two piles of folded t-shirts fit insideTHE CON'S1. Mediocre quality - metal side panels flex2. Not all of the side panels align with base3. Wheels sometimes turn in different directionsOVERALLThis product functions well. It could be challenging to use on thick pile carpet because the wheels may be too small (I haven't tested it though). The same product was also available online at Walmart for a cheaper price.
1,Awful,"Flimsy. The wheels don't screw in, so you can't ever lift the drawer or you'll have to put all the wheels on again. Even when the screws are in place, there is a slight rattle. I picked this drawer because it was one of the cheaper ones with a decent review, but I'd recommend spending $5-$10 extra and getting a better drawer."
2,Best comment I have is they fit under the furniture intended,"Not sturdy at all. Wobbly. The ""floor"" of them pops up and isn't secured. I can see these as maybe useful if you want to put linens in them, but anything heavier and they'll just fall apart."
1,Save your money,"Sorry to say, its not worth the money. Some very old illustrations. I would be ashamed to charge this amount of money for such little substance."
2,Buy 'Reel Big Fish! Live in Concert' Instead of this!!!!!!!!!!!!,This concert dvd is good but the bands other dvd 'Reel Big Fish! Live in Concert' is WAY WAY better. It has better sound quality and the band isn't constantly stopping to joke around forever between songs.
5,"""Hey look, there's boobies!""","This is a hillarious must-have DVD for any Reel Big Fish fan! Plus it's really cool that you can switch angles throughout the live performance. Includes Aaron blasting Sell Out in his car while smoking a cigar in the Taco Bell drive-thru, Tyler Jones pouring Jack Daniels in to audience member's mouths, and overall just a kickass performance! Also, the commentary by Aaron and Scott is hillarious too! Just get the DVD!"
4,I like it alright,"I love RBF's music, I've seen them play twice, and loved both shows I'd been to. Having seen this DVD on the market, I bought it immediately. I'd never seen them perform with Tyler Jones before this DVD... Man, I can't stand him! Couldn't the guy just shut the hell up??? He's annoying throughout, he's an obnoxious drunk, keeps yelling out ""We're number 87!"" which nobody else in the band thinks is funny, and you can just watch Aaron and Scott both thinking, ""What the hell is Tyler doing?"" It's really hard to watch, but the music is great, and the rest of the band is as entertaining as ever. I'd have given it five stars but for Tyler's performance."
3,reel big fish,"this is an ok dvd, when i saw them live they sounded better. if you are a fan of reel big fish you will like it even though its not there best work. i would rent it beofre i buy it to see it you like it."
2,More books needed,This book will teach you the basics. iT does not prepare you for the test. I read the whole book cover to cover and understood it completely. The test is nowhere as easy as this books questions. It does not go into depth with scenerios that can be helpful. I recommend you get the microsoft books for this test. If you are currently working with 2003 it will help alot. but do not plan to only use this book unless you luck up and get the perfectly tailored test to what this books covers.
4,Must have...,"Anyone who is seeking a Microsoft Engineering certification should obtain this book. In fact, the entire Sybex series of books are great."
2,Sets you up for a fail.,"The book is an easy read, which is good. You'll have an easy time getting through the questions, but when you go to take the test you'll fail. This book is no where a good match for the exam. I suggest this book for people who want to learn about Win2k3 AD, but if you're getting it to prepare for the test you should think twice. Nothing this book discuss could have prepared me for the test. Bummer."
3,"Good performance of the fourth, but the second is a little dull","Naxos's first traversal of the Tchaikovsky symphonies under Adrian Leaper and Antoni Wit is not an unqualified success, and this disc of the second and fourth symphonies is not as good as the one containing the first. The Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra is still a (surprisingly?) good ensemble, where both brass and strings sounds full-bodied, and the woodwind solos are splendid. Still, the performances have the air of being run-throughs and sounds comfortably anodyne rather than exciting. The fourth receives the best performance, and the finale is genuinely exciting here. Sound quality is not perfect either, being rather subdued and not always perfectly balanced. So, while the performance of the fourth is recommendable with qualifications, the second is a little dull, and all in all this is no more than a worthwhile release."
3,Great Experience,"Reading this book was like being led through a theme park for adults with all the rides and attractions you'd expect to find in a gritty film noir play land. The writer paints vivid images, truly placing me in 1970's LA. A few of his descriptions rivaled Steinbeck and his capable use of ""film noir speak"" is to be envied. Believable characters, especially O'Brien, the lead. He has a unique voice with which I could identify. Quite suspenseful at times."
3,Good Choice of Songs - But..,I thought introductions were long and some sounded the same on several tracks.Needed a little more energy in the playing I thought.
4,It is a good biography of his life.,It is a good biography of his life. It shows good times and bad times and what happened when and little odds and ends that happened in his life. It has good stuff in it.
2,Not a good experience,This is a nice looking watch. I've had good luck with durability with other Nike watches in the past. One negative thing about the watch is the date information is very small and difficult to set and see. The other major problem I had with this watch is that it stopped working after less than a month of ownership.
5,EXCELLENT DELUXE EDITION!,"PERSONALLY,I THINK THIS 2 CD SET PLUS DVD-AUDIO DISC HAS THE AUDIO QUALITY AND THE OVERALL PRODUCTION CORRECT.OVERALL,I LIKE THIS PACKAGE INCLUDING THE BONUS MATERIAL/PICTURES/BOOKLET,ETC..BUT FOR ME, NOT HAVING THE ENTIRE--""THREE FATES""/""TANK"" TRACKS ON THE NEW 2012 STEREO MIX CD NOR ON THE DVD AUDIO DISC AS WELL AS NOT BEING ON THE HIGH RESOLUTION MIXES MAKES THIS COLLECTION INCOMPLETE FOR ME.I'M A REAL ELP FANATIC FROM DAY ONE AND FOR THIS OLD ELP/NICE VETERAN I WISH IT WAS COMPLETE.BUT OVERALL,I'M HAPPY ABOUT THIS RELEASE."
4,Possibly their best,"It never got any better than this from my point of view. This is a much more piano-based than synthesizer-based album. They had not yet developed their trademark style - and that's a good thing! They were a bit more experimental here, delving into classical music more, showing off their chops (especially Emerson, but also Palmer on the instrumental Tank). Side one (of the original LP) is wonderful. ""Take A Pebble"" and ""Knife-edge"" are one of my favorite back-to-back sequences in rock. Side two fizzles a bit. There are two okay instrumentals, followed by the tedious, overplayed ""Lucky Man."" Still, add it to your collection and then go out and get Tarkus and Brain Salad Surgery, and you've got almost all you need from ELP."
3,Not the best remixing job by SW,"I have purchased other remixes made by Steven Wilson (King Crimson, Jethro Tull, etc.)and frankly, this job doesn't impress me at all. Disc One is a remaster already available and sounds very dull and compressed. Disc 2 is a little better not not much, probably because of limitations of the source tapes found. the DVD-A with the 5.1 mix is better, but doesn't get close to the old vinyl Cotillion LP so treasured in my youth.On the other hand, the artwork is horrible, with barely readable pages and pictures that show fold lines.This seems to be a rushed job. What ultimately saves the day is the music, well composed, arranged and performed.If you owns any other version, this is not deemed essential, but if you don't, this is the best way to get that first album"
4,Confused about the MP3 download pricing,"Why does this (absolutely terrific) album cost $9.99 to download, when you can individually download each of the six tracks at $.99 each? What am I missing?"
2,A flop,"Now I do understand why this particular re-issue by Music on Vinyl cost so much less on the market.This re-issue sounds horrible .My regular Atlantic copy sounds much better.This one lacks details, bass,middle range is muffed, etc.etc.I would not dare to try other re-issues of ELP my MoV.A pity though-I was really looking forward to a better experience."
4,Wonderful beginning,"I think ELP is the most fascinating and most extraordinary rock band of the classical rock era and especially the 70's and 80's. In this debut album they made a very strong entrance to rock world as a trio. Apart from their success in their previous bands, these three man prove that they were born for each other to make beatiful music. In this album you can find classical songs like The Barbarian, Knife Edge and Take A Pebble. If you keep on listening ELP you'll see that it is not by chance these men are still making music together. So I highly recommend this album to classical rock fans and those that have not listened ELP before. It is a very good beginning for the band and the fans I think."
5,A+ DEBUT,"This newly formed band (only months old) already sounded like a veteran supergroup. This album represents what happens when the right musicians find each other at the right time. All three fresh from other notable bands (King Crimson,The Nice,and Atomic Rooster) it was a ""meeting of the gods"", all the way until the end of the Brain Salad Surgery tour.(I know people who saw ELP on the BSS tour and said that no other sound system or performance even came close) If you like adventurous music, this is one of the best albums you'll ever hear."
1,Very poor analog source for this CD,"The analog source for some selections is very poor, likely very heavily filtered, seriously lacks fidelity. The CD only contains the front side of the original record. The back side of the original record was exceptionally excellent, and it's disappointing that it was not included."
1,Not sure what I expected,"but musically, I did not find the disk appealing other than one cut. Sorry, I would not buy it again if I had the option."
1,What's with these prices?,"Listed at $999.99!!!! At this price, I'd expect it to be hand delivered by Keith Emerson! I bet it sounds great, but at this price, I'll just keep playing the vinyl copy I bought in the 70s."
2,"""Classic"" album is actually a snooze fest","Emmerson, Lake and Palmer were one of the worst examples of a 1970s supergroup. They had the same problem that would befall Yes in that they often forgot to infuse their songs with a decent melody and they just didn't know when to quit. Mercifully, the idea of combining classic music and rock music died a quarter of a century ago, and ELP were the lead pallbearers at the funeral. This album, their debut, contains their best song, the decent and catchy ""Lucky Man."" Beyond that you get a lot of aimless noodling and pointless soloing. At least Yes put together a couple of very strong albums before decending into mediocrity. ELP was there at the start."
1,"Oh, so that is a Moog? Nice.","The first time I listened to the solo in Lucky Man, I thought ""this is a very interesting new instrument"".After I listened to the thing for a hundred times, I couldn't help noticing it was just a silly ballad after all. As for the other themes, well, these guys seemed to believe they were some sort of serious composers, right? (huh-huh-huh...)I never got to listen to it a thousand times -I threw the darn vinyl album away and never cared to get the CD. Not much to miss."
5,A cornerstone of prog-rock -- Highly recommended,"This is the breakthrough album that helped launch the prog-rock genre. ELP's debut album combined the talents of keyboardist Keith Emerson, Bassist/vocalist Greg Lake, and drummer Carl Palmer. The first time I listened to this album, it was apparent that Keith Emerson had finally found band mates who were his equal (as opposed to the mediocre sidekicks in his former band, the Nice). The pieces on this album are big, bold, and rendered with incredible power. A ""must have"" for prog-rock fans and one of prog-rock's true cornerstone albums.A personal note:I had the good fortune to see ELP one night at the Hollywood Bowl shortly after the release of this album. My friend and I arrived late, and while out in the parking lot, we could hear the band in midst of ""take a pebble"". Since we were behind the bowl, the sound of Greg Lake's voice and Keith's piano could be heard resonating magically off of the Hollywood hills. Absolutely incredible!"
4,5.1 DVD Audio disc review,"Assuming that most ELP fans will be purchasing this album for the twentieth time exclusively for the surround mix disc, you should be warned that you won't get the entire album in surround format. While there are plenty of reasons for the ELP fan and completist to get this version, it probably wouldn't be for this new mix on its own. The net effect of What's-His-Name's remix is that of a sort of ""exploded diagram"" of the album, which reveals that the sum of its parts, more discernible though they may be, do not rise to the level of the original two-channel masterpiece. There's some exciting bonus material (which ELP fans have been told for years didn't exist) which will probably be worth the quite reasonable price of this three-disc set, but keep your expectations grounded: ultimately, this is at its core another reissue of a forty-year-old analogue recording, not the second coming of Art Rock."
3,3 3/4 stars - nice debut,"A pretty nice debut album for ELP from 1970, the same year they made their concert debut at the famous Isle of Wight festival (the same one where Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison made their final concert appearances).The ELP sound is a bit raw compared to their later work, but their skills still shine since the three were already veterans of the music business. The most recognizable track is ""Lucky Man"", which is one of their signature songs.A job well done, and an album worth listening to."
5,Great album,"manditory purchase with Steven Wilson 5.1 mix. Damn!The surround mix is amazing. I've just heard Steven will not finished the cycle, very disappointing."
5,I bought it for the DVD Audio Disk and was not disappointed.,"Unfortunately, The DVD Audio format has, for the most part, gone the way of the dinosaur. It is refreshing to see the occasional disk make an appearance, especially one with a 5.1 mix, (Most of the newer SACDs, a comparable format to DVD Audio, contain only two channel mixes, which I find very disappointing.) I have not played this ELP on my home theater system yet but I am very impressed with the 5.1 and 2 channel DVD Audio mixes on my Hyundai Genesis Lexicon car audio system. Highly recommended for those with the capability to take advantage of the DVD Audio format. I also liked the DVD Audio of Tarkus, although, I've always had a preference, musically speaking, for ELPs first recording. I'd like to see 5.1. mixes for Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgery."
5,A great place to start.,"This band could never really be represented by a compilation album. So, you need to find the best studio albums and go from there. ELP's debut is a good place to start. Along with Classic Rock staple ""Lucky Man"" you also have ""Take A Pebble"" and ""Knife's Edge."" The band really never sounded tighter than this. The next album, ""Tarkus,"" proved that."
3,Not what I thought it was going to be,"Was never that big a fan of ELP but I like their music and appreciate their place in rock history. Brain Salad Surgery was probably their high water mark. They sure road the horse that was their few hits to death. Never owned this particular album so it was a new experience for me to hear it remastered and in 5.1/2.0 higher resolution. For some strange reason not clearly explained in the liner notes, TANK was left off the DVD-A. That's kinda like false advertising. Anyway, not impressed with this effort from the band or the record company as deluxe reissue. I hope Tarkus is better. Still grooving on my copy of Brain Salad Surgery on DVD-A."
1,"""An Addendem To The Review By RockSteadyEddie......""","In regards to the replacement of the cuts ""Clotho,"" ""Lachesis,"" and ""Tank"" from the DVD-A 5.1 Mix, to me it is also strange indeed, more so by the fact that when Steve Wilson re-mixed KING CRIMSON'sIn The Wake Of Poseidonfor 5.1 they also were missing multi-track reels for ""The Devil's Triangle,"" but were able to ""painstakingly (remix it) from a stereo version."" I guess Robert Fripp has more patience and regard for his past work......"
4,Good multi channel sound,"Well remastered. Good use of all channels. Not as good as Brain Salad Surgery, but passable. Well worth the money"
1,PATTERN QUA;LITY,I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECEIVED THE MILK PICTURE. THE PATTERN LOOKS FADED COMPARED TO MY OTHER PIECES. I WAS CONSDERING SEND IT BACK BUT HAVE NOT DONE SO JUST YET. I AM DISAPPOINTED.
2,Uninspired,"The pictures and ideas were fabulous, However, The book lacks any instruction. These creations are not for beginners nor mildly experienced decorative painters."
1,Useless and frustrating,"If this had been created and written as a coffee table book designed simply to show how a fine artist created lovely painted finishes, that would be OK. But it is ""billed"" as an ""idea"" book for ordinary people. Created by a fine artist who obviously has no clue as to what the rest of us can actually DO, this book is useless and frustrating."
3,Rik's Rhetoric,"This was my first listen to the solo side of Rik Emmett and I hated it at first. The reason why was all the great reviews I read on Amazon[.com] had Rik pegged as guitarist elite; and he could do no wrong.First, I've listened to this like 15 times trying to find some great awareness. It's cute. But it's probably not his best; and no where near his days with Triumph. Let's face it together...each cut has about 10-15 secs of lead at best. Second, it just wreaks of studio.Again, the music's cute but too,damned clean. I gave my copy away. I did just buy ""Ipso facto"" and I am hoping for a better experience---Three stars max---tah-dah."
1,Poor Quality TV Broadcast,"You know this DVD sounds too good to be true...and sure enough it is. The videos are all ""licensed"" from somewhere overseas where they were originally used on a Make or Break It type program. Most of the videos are of marginal quality and nearly all have program logos and other writing on the screen. Not usable at all for my purposes."
5,Review of JUDGMENT,"This is a very important work, dealing with the troubling and sensitive subject of sexual abuse--within the church. This was a courageous drama, and everyone involved in the making of this film is to be commended for tackling not only a disturbing subject, but the controversy which occurs when the perpetrator of sexual abuse is a trusted religious figure. Thank you, to the makers of this film. Anyone needing affirmation, who has suffered abuse themselves or is acquanted with an abuse survivor, should view this film."
1,Amazons typo resulted in me being shipped wrong item,A typo at Amazon.com showed the wrong scale. The title and descriptions all described the SECA 700LBKG with a 500LB/220KG limit but I was shipped the 400LB scale. After contacting the company I was told that there was a typo at Amazon. I returned the scale and am waiting for my refund. I did not reorder another scale from Amazon. I instead ordered one from Wal-Mart so that if there was a problem I could just take it to the local store and not have to pay to ship it back. Amazon did give me a $30.00 discount on a future order but I am very distrustful when I try to order online now.
4,Great Book ... Amazing Typo,"Wonderful book, but did anyone else flip out over the ""IT'S"" typo on the cover?WOW."
3,"So, so kid reaction",These pieces are nice but didn't seem to have as much appeal to a 5 yr old as I'd hoped.The back of the desk chair broke off the first day but I was able to glue it back on securely.My dolls (not by the same manufacturer) were also a bit large for the furniture which may explain why it wasn't used much.The accessories are a very nice addition though and have held up well so far. I wish they had included something that could be displayed in the bookcase.
5,Just like Daddy's offce.,"My daughter loves her little office - 'just like Daddy's'. Like all Plan Toys, this is well designed, durable and fun for kids. We have several other sets of furniture in a Plan Toys house."
5,Metallica Tribute,Its cool to listen to. It sound like these versions are off from a video game for sega genesis.I'm giving this 5 stars because they took a risk and make these songs like if they were there's instead of hearing the same ol many times before.
1,Not worthy of covering metallica,What the hell were you thinking trying to cover metallica?? there are very few bands if any that could cover metallica. YOU ARE DEFINITLY NOT ONE OF THEM.
2,Very different,"A techno-remix of songs off And Justice For All and also some Master of Puppets. Ok, but seems very sacreligous to metallica fans... END"
2,"It's OK, but i wouldnt spend money on it.","I like Die Krupps, but they shouldn't have tried to convert Metallica into industrial. It just didnt work. I dont understand how they could have thought it would have sounded ok without guitar."
4,A great CD for angering a Metallica fan.,"Judging from the reviews here and the time I played this for my sister (who is a huge Metallica fan), I'd say that no red-blooded Metallica fan would stand by this EP. However, James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich did endorse it (according to the liner notes), but I think they have a much better sense of humor about what other bands do to their music than their fans do. Personally, I enjoyed it. But what I found to be the strangest thing about it is that Die Krupps (and that's pronounced ""dee"" krupps because it's German) produced this before they began incorporating metal guitars into their music, so that nowadays they sound much more like Metallica than they did in the early '90s. In fact, they're featured on the industrial tribute to Metallica, ""Covered In Black"", doing ""Battery"", although it is a newer, more metal-sounding version than the one on this CD."
1,This ISN'T a tribute!,"After listening to some of the samples, all I can say is that it's HORRIBLE! Their covers are extremely cheesy compared to the originals! The band should've done a much better job!"
1,I can't believe James & Lars allowed this,"This album is one of the most atrocious few minutes of music I have ever heard. They give you two versions of ""One"" and they both sound outright comical- though I'm sure that was unintended. Besides the strong accent, the singer always sounds like he's running out of breath and trying to squeeze out his last few words before he passes out- too bad he never did."
2,Its pretty hard to totally screw up Metallica tunes........,".....but these guys somehow did. They somehow turned ""One"", which could easily be called the best song ever, into a disco dance song. Whats next, NSYNC or Destiny's Child doing a cover of Megadeth's ""Peace Sells, but Who's Buying""?I usually enjoy tribute albums, especially Metallica ones, that are totally different than the originals. But turning Metallica to a dance groove is just wrong. Go pick up ""A Punk Tribute to Metallica."" It does the band justice. Listen to the Surf Punk Version of Seek and Destroy on that disc; thats how you change a song up, and still make it good.The only reason this gets 2 stars is that it is a very interesting listen, borrow it from someone if you can, just for weird listen."
2,"not metallica's best sound, but not their worst either","It sounds worse than anything before the black album and better than anything after. It's better than listening to Hetfield's vocals now. A very cheesey cover album. It sounds like Die Krupps is trying to sound cool, but it's beyond their ability to. The album sounds like some kid i don't know, that would ask me over to his house to check out his, new cool midi keyboard that he can hook up to his computer. That's why it didn't get five stars."
1,This album is horrible,"I consider this album an insult to Metallica, you just can't take something like ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" or any other Metallica song, and do a remake of it without any guitars."
5,Great Read,"This is a great book about being thankful. It is very thought provoking and insightful. I used the book for several Sunday School lessons just prior to Thanksgiving Holiday for an Adult Sunday School Class. The author of the book has seen great tragedy in her life but choose to have a ""thankful heart""."
2,Really not that helpful,This book looked promising until I got to the part about God having a good and perfect plan....and part of that plan was the death of the authors daughter. Sorry but this is not Gods plan. Look at what He saya in Jeremiah 29.11 God is good and does not allow death as part of HIS plan. He can use such things but to belive otherwise may make us feel better but negates that He really is good.
5,Becoming more Christ-like in our prayer life...,"...that's what this lovely little book teaches. Our prayer trainer, Jesus, prayed, ""I thank you, Lord, that you have heard me."" We, too, have so much to be thankful for--and Carole Lewis' book helps us develop gratefulness and humility. I highly recommend this book as a gift for others or yourself."
4,Guilty pleasure,"I have sung many of Rutter's choral works and arrangements, but I never knew that he had done orchestral works until I heard the Beatles Concerto on the radio. I had to have this album, and I was not disappointed. Distant Land is inspiring, the other works are very pleasurable, and as an old baby boomer Beatles fan, I just love to sing along with the concerto, even if he did steal shamelessly from Chopin and Rachmaninof for some of the piano interludes. I have searched for a copy of the score, but I can't yet find it."
4,Rutter... without words,"Beautiful instrumental setting. Distant Land (the first track) is surely the highlight of the album. The Five Meditations are also very pleasant to listen to. The suite for strings is great to if you like a little bit of ""Modern influence"". The Suite Antique is fun but sometimes it sounds ""awkward"" as the ""baroque style"" instrumentation and the ""contemporary"" musical themes clash from time to time. The Beatles Cto is a curiosity. Great if you like to collect all these type of Beatles arrangements (baroque style, classical style, string quartet settings, etc.)"
5,One of the best,"I was thoroughly pleased with this purchase. One of the best CD's in my collection. Very soothing to listen to. I was never a great Beatles fan, but listening to this rendition of their works was extemely pleasing.I highly recomend it.Dan Barber"
4,Rutter as orchestral composer,"This is a record of music that would fall into the category of English Light Music: and what a fine example it is! Five pieces of 'easy listening' played by The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with Rutter himself as conductor. The opening title track is a quite beautiful piece for soprano (Melanie Marshall), choir (The Cambridge Singers) and orchestra. It is dedicated to Nelson Mandela. The remaining pieces are for orchestra alone, some up-tempo, some slow and languorous: Five Meditations for Orchestra, a Suite for Strings, Suite Antique and a quite delightful and playful reworking of themes from the Beatles into a Concerto for Two Pianos (Peter Rostal and Paul Schaefer). This is music of the type that Bax, Finzi or Moeran might have written - but the style is unmistakably Rutter's. A thoroughly enjoyable disc.Serenade in G / Fall of a Leaf by E.J. MoeranArnold Bax: Tone Poems"
1,Not to my taste,"I was sorry I purchased this CD. For the most part I like John Rutter's music, but this orchestral collection was not to my taste. If you like 101 Strings or music typically associated with a wait at the doctor's, this is for you. Although there were some exciting passages(Suite Antique being the best of the disc), after reading the glowing reviews here I expected something more than mostly background filler."
5,Beats the Deal I Got!,"Spent $17.99 for the equivalent from 'Finest' brand, plus $1.61 tax, for a total of $19.60 at Walgreens! I won't make that mistake again."
3,Nowhere to ask seller a question!!!!!,"You have this listed as a 25mg tablet, but then you click into the sale and it says it is a 10mg tablet. Your picture is of a 25 mg box. So which is it???????"
5,excellent,"This book treats the basic principles of abstract algebra.It is targeted to graduate students that need a more theoretical approach to mathematics (instead of the usual calculus courses)This book is the best introduction to abstract algebra for the following reasons-its style : good introduction in each chapter, making the reader curious to read further.-its rigor : everything is well explained in full details with proof.-its elegance : This book treats the abstract structural aspects of algebra and then suddenly shows how more concrecte applications follow from these abstract results. This is the kind of elegance and style that makes mathematics an art : build a very abstract theory and then see how more concrete stuff follows immediately as special case of this abstract framework. This way, new things can be discovered and most of the time (as in this book), you can explain practical calculation rules in a short and rigorous way.Definitely the finest there is ...."
4,Great for mild seborrheic dermatitis,"I am an African American woman with naturally non chemically treated hair. I often get scales, bad dandruff, itching, and sometimes sores from my scratches on my scalp. I began using this shampoo last week and I see major improvement with minimal flaking. I usually get my hair pressed weekly so 3-4 washes weekly is a bit excessive for me. I wash twice the day before I go to the salon and let it sit for 10 minutes. I also let my stylist wash it twice and let it sit for 10 minutes on the second lather. I'm on the second week and I have minimal flaking and NO ITCHING.....I'm so excited and relieved.....definitely a must have if you have excessive dandruff and it's not drying like a lot of anti-dandruff shampoos."
4,conveniently packaged kit,"I use this to clean my Canon SLR camera. Overall, it was much cheaper than taking it into the shop to be cleaned.The kit is pretty basic with bunch of parts that you could buy separately probably for cheaper. But I would recommend it based on convenience of everything needed --packaged together. And ordering it online versus going to a camera shop.If you follow the directions, and have a steady hand, it will clean your sensor just fine."
2,Don't really like the Pec-Pad,"I've had the kit for a couple months now, not too impressed with the Pec-Pads that come with it. I've noticed that everytime I use the pads, small fibers are left behind. I've now resorted to a basic glass cleaning cloth instead. Haven't used the wand to clean the sensor yet, sorry can't comment on that. Hope this helps."
3,Sensor cleaning kit,"Well I'm with mixed feelings on this one. Some sites say you won't ever need this unless something really dumb happens to get junk on your sensor. So far after 6 years or so with 2 DSLR's, I've not needed this last resort measure of cleaning. The kit remains in its box.My Rocket air cleaner does the trick so far although I admit one time I really had to work at it to dislodge a piece of junk off of the sensor. So if you or I don't do any thing real dumb, like during the cleaning procedure, (raised mirror) by blowing thereby spitting on the sensor, I really dont think this thing is needed. Can't say how to rate this w/o actually using it. My 2cents."
5,Outstanding!,"Returning to college @ 48, I took an Anthropology course. We viewed this series and I was hooked! This is not only Don Johanson's personal story of how he found ""Lucy,"" but also OUR story....well, at least a good piece of it.Dr. Johanson leads us thru human evolution honestly...with the humility to tell us he doesn't have all the answers and the whole story can change as new discoveries are unearthed. Plus, it has been my great fortune to meet and visit with Don and he is so unlike the typical professor...very down to earth and fun! This 3 hour Nova series should be your first step to a greater understanding of our distant anscestors. I recommend it highly!"
4,this is for educational purposes,"To let you know where I stand: I'm a University student; Episode 2 of this set was required to watch for a class class i'm taking. I would never think of watching the whole thing or buying the DVD if I wasn't doing anthro research. Anyways, I don't know what the reviewer who gave it one star is talking about--maybe instead of watching educational materials, he should watch Mission Impossible or a movie starring Jonny Depp--he'll be that much more entertained. And this I say to other students: beware implications of any research; most likely it is erroneous. This DVD set has errors and inconsistencies too, which nonetheless does not not give you a reason not to watch it. And yes, I enjoyed watching it."
1,Very dissapointing,"The document is more a bunch of anectotic bla bla, full of not scientific adjectives. You will not find serious nor interesting science, rather a narcisist and boring story about the self claimed ""incredible arquelogical"" findings of the author."
4,Carpal Tunnel Care,I have been taking Carp-L Care for about 3 weeks and my carpal tunnel has greatly improved!!
2,NYET QUITE,"Technically adept, but emotionally stolid and mannered, Prunyi's Tchaikovsky recital is a disappointment, especially with so little of this composer's piano works available. It's remarkable how studied her approach is, how devoid of appeal, spontaneity and Russian soul. Where is the poetry and charisma these compositions easily evoke? Even perennial charmers like the Romance, Op. 5, or Reverie, Op. 19, No. 1, seem merely routine. As well, the placement and juxtapositioning of the pieces themselves doesn't quite work, making the music appear maddeningly lackluster, which it certainly is not. To add insult to injury, the exceptionally realistic recording, compounded by generous disc length, only serves to augment the unfortunate interpretive monotony. Those unfamiliar with Tchaikovsky's piano works should seek out alternative performers, such as Ponti, Postnikova, Richter and Pletnev, who are outstanding in this repertoire.[Running time: 69:50]"
3,Excellent Program; So-So Performance,"Though all of the works on this disc are characteristically Tchaikovskian, the performance by Ilona Prunyi does leave something to be desired. This disc is an example of when hitting all the right notes isn't enough. Especially in the more exciting pieces, one gets the idea that the pianist is doing this as a part of a contract and not out of any love for the music. Sometimes the playing seems downright wooden.This said, sometimes a certain charm does shine through. The Polka peu dansante in B minor, Op. 51 No. 2 is delightful. The inexpensive price may tempt some buyers, but other accounts are available at a similar cost. (Pletnev's albumMussorgsky: Pictures at an Exhibition; Tchaikovsky: The Seasons, Sleeping Beautywould be one example)"
3,Annie's Video's,This is a very good video and covers quite a bit of worthwhile information. The problem is that it seems like all of Annie's videos cover the same information and use the same footage.
1,cheated,I bought 2 dvd's .....and both were the same except for a small part in the begining....she even wore the same clothes.....Her brother did the same thing.....both dvd's were the same except for a small part at the start...He even wore the same clothes in both dvd's.....I'll never buy another of their dvd's....shari
4,Lisa Brokop is back!!!,"Lisa Brokop is one of those artists that if she had some backing from her label she would be HUGE here in the U.S. like she already is in Canada. Her new Cd is very good. She had a hand in writting 11 of the 13 songs. She is a great story telling writter. Her music style is smooth. Her best songs on the CD are ""Hey, Do you Know Me?"", ""Let Me Love Again"" (with Steve Holy), ""Just a Girl"" & ""Faith, Hope and Love."" If you are new to Lisa and enjoy this CD, I suggest buying her best effort ""When You Get to Be You."" One of the best Country C.D.'s ever!!!"
4,A breath of fresh air for US country fans,"I was so excited to see that Lisa released some new music. She doesn't disappoint on her latest effort. I've embraced this lovely lady from up north for 11 years now-hopefully U.S. audiences will get another chance with her new Curb CD. The songs that stand out for me right now are ""What I'd Miss,"" ""Faith, Hope And Love,"" ""One Bad Day,"" ""Paper, Rock, Scissors"" and the fun ""Lime Green Pacer."" I must agree with another reviewer that if you want the best of Lisa, also pick up ""When You Get To Be You."" But let's support Lisa and her new music and show her that she does have a few loyal fans and listeners in the States as well-let's hope the numbers grow!"
2,foot...logics?,"I have yet to find a product to clear up toenail fungus....even those that are guaranteed to work. It's logical that something should make this condition improve and I thought Footlogix did clear it up some. But it hasn't worked to my satisfaction, especially for the price."
5,Very Good Product,"I've used this before and continue to use it, especially after getting salon pedicures. No matter how clean the salon purports to be, I used to end up with cracked and peeling nails. I use this every few days, and am diligent in applying it after going to the salon and it seems to keep the fungus at bay. It's not a one shot fix, but if used regularly, it really works."
1,The Fauxest Rock I've Ever Seen,"I purchased this to cover a well head on my property. When it arrived, I found the product to be one of the ugliest excuses for a rock I have ever seen. It is extremely light weight, and for it's size and height, this is unacceptable. The wind picked it up quickly when I tried to place it. I called the merchant to return the product and they told me to ship it back for a refund. The cost for shipping was $65 UPS and I have neither been able to secure a refund for this shipping, not have I yet seen the credit to my account - and it has been 3 weeks. I would not recommend purchasing this item and would consider carefully before purchasing from this vendor again."
4,Buy it!,"Like Beethoven? Like classical music? Think you've heard it all? Not so fast! Buy this set of ""small"" treasures and you're in for a treat!"
1,Don't waste your money,"If you are looking for the sweet harmonies from the 70s and 80s Little River Band, you won't find them here. This is a latter-day covers band that contains no original members of the great LRB."
1,Only for Bret Easton Ellis fans?,"Several years ago, I picked up a few Bret Easton Ellis books and really wanted to like them, but found that they simply weren't my thing. My Loose Thread reminded me strongly of Ellis' work in both style and subject.The extreme violence may put off some, although I would argue that the imagery is relevant in understanding Larry and the world as he sees it. But it is the chaotic narrative that challenged me. While I suppose it is a device to underscore the confusion and insanity of the main character, we only jump into situations as an observer in Larry's head with the reality or Larry's perceived reality at that moment is what we experience. Larry, as the narrator of the book, never treats the reader as a trusted confidant and doesn't help us pull the pieces together in a way that help really understand who he is and what his motivations are. I believe that is probably intentional, but is a writing style that does not work for me."
2,Too Loose,"It is hard to understand the rave reviews from usually reputable sources regarding this book (I use the term loosely). It is almost impossible to follow and frequently contradictory. Did Larry do his little brother or not? Is Cooper sloppy or does he intentionally misspell Dylan Klebold's name? If so, why? Read this only if you like whacked out, deeply disturbed characters who you may or may not be able to understand."
3,hm,"the first Cooper book i've read. i finished it a couple of months ago, and struggle now to remember anything particular about it. and this is my first point; it is all written on the flat. the author has an excellent ear for dialogue, and is pleasingly experimental with his syntax, but the voice remains the same throughout. Larry in a car being troubled and talking about murder, Larry in his room being troubled and talking about murder, Larry back in his car again being...etc. i couldn't help feeling the whole thing was something of a glamorisation of troubled youth too. rather than charting what is actually present in the disturbed young male psyche, i had the impression Cooper was charting it rather as he wanted it to be. overall, i felt i got more out of the book stylistically than content-wise. that said, it is an intelligent, unusual piece of work, and should be valued for these qualities which are present all too rarely in books published today."
1,Oh my! Terrible quality!,"I have purchased many items from Amazon. This is the first product that I have received that was of poor quality. This flute does not keep pitch, tune or general sound quality. It is an insult to Native American Flute making. I recommend that this product be removed from the Amazon list of products."
1,Synthetic Native American Flute,"First of all, if this is synthetic it's not a Native American flute and secondly, The Indian Arts and Craft Law of 1990 prohibits selling any craft as ""Native American, Native American made, or Indian"" if you are not a member of a federally recognized or state recognized tribe.First time violators face a $250,000 fine and Ebay has placed this notice on their site to comply with the Indian arts and Craft Law of 1990. Business face up to $1000,000 fine for first offense. So know the law!To report a fake product you purchased or to report someone selling them call the Indian Arts and Craft Board at the U.S. Department of Interior at 1-888-ART-FAKE or visit http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html"
1,Native American Made?,"Native American Flute? Well, better be careful about saying that. You can say Native American Styled but this flute is not good at all. I am a recording artist and a Native American. The main problem with this flute is that the fetish doesn't move. You cannot adjust it at all. So whoever made this isn't a flute player.Secondly, its raspy, and it is to heavy. The hole is to big and the PVC pipe is to long for the G flute. Get it together. This should either be reworked or taken out of circulation.Disappointed!CE"
3,"Good, but not the best...","Sleeping Beauty is probably the best of Tchaikovsky's ballets. If you are looking for a good recording of it, this one is nice, but a little slow and muffled. Since it is slow, it might be easier to dance to. But, if you want a clear, dynamic recording, I suggest the one conducted by Antal Dorati and the RCA label."
4,Possibly the greatest ballet ever written.,"Tchaikovsky was a great composer who wrote symphonies, concertos, and other works which are beloved by classical music lovers. But his greatest compositions almost certainly were his three ballets, and the most uniquely beautiful of Tchaikovsky's ballets is The Sleeping Beauty. In my opinion it is the most beautiful ballet -- and one of the most beautiful works in any genre -- ever written by any composer. My favorite (five star) performances of The Sleeping Beauty are those by Richard Bonynge and Andre Previn. But Andrew Mogrelia is a very fine ballet conductor and this complete 3-CD set is a wonderful bargain."
3,Average to Good,"I recently purchased this disc, and I must confess that I have not been moved by it, though it has grown on me. It is a real bargain for the price, though."
3,So So,"It was a well made product. However, I Ordered my usual 36C and it didn't fit well. Chest tight and cups big. Returned it because of the fit issue."
3,Not what I expected...,"I had read a lot of reviews on this bra and decided to purchase one thinking it would look nice under clothing and be comfortable. It was comfortable, but it gave my chest the pointy boob look. It fit right everywhere else but the nipple area was not right. So I returned it right after I recieved it."
2,Irritating,"Rolls up in the front and pulls up in the back so that I have to keep pulling it down. Also, the shoulder straps sit too wide on my shoulders and keep falling. When will bra makers realize that ""full figure"" DOES NOT mean the woman has the shoulders of a linebacker? This bra is irritating."
1,Too tight and shaped me weird,"I was looking for good support that also provided a nice shape, so I ordered the Playtex Women's 18 Hour Airform Comfort Lace Bra. Unfortunately, this bra didn't stretch to my shape nor provide a nice bust shape. It was too tight around my rib cage (I was expecting it to stretch more) and forced my breasts into a strange pointy shape, flattening them across the top and mashing me down in the middle. I didn't need a minimizer bra, but it would be great for that purpose. I cut off the non-stretchable lace on the front surface, leaving only the stretchable material underneath and it was tolerable that way, but I would not order it again."
5,Great bras !!!!!!,Service was great and I love these bras. Thks for ur great service. Have a nice day.
1,Do not recommend this,"The name of this bra is a contradiction. Not comfortable,gave me an extra breast and made them sag."
3,Not what I hoped for,"I ordered a bra, which admittedly is a difficult purchase to make sight unseen. Not having been able to try it on, even though I took careful measurements,it doesn't fit.I had hoped that I could merely re-order one just like what I have and like, but Vanity Fair must have quit making that model? I could not find it in on-line searches.I am still in the dilemma of where to locate what I need (not living near urban shops)."
2,Runs small and stiff,I had to return this bra because it was so small that I could barely get it on. The straps were adjustable but very inflexible. It's also very stiff and non-stretchy. I was looking for something really comfortable and this definitely wasn't for me.
4,Decent functional Bra,I waited until I wore this bra for a few weeks before my critique. It definitely is supportive. It made me realize just how much I needed it! =:0The only ngative aspect is that the front band rolls a bit but that could very well be just my shape! All in all even better than I had hoped!
2,Sizing is WRONG WRONG WRONG,"The sizing on these is way off. Not even close. They run large, compared with other Playtex bras. I think I even went a size or too smaller than usual, after reading other reviews, and they were still too big (& super pointy! yuk). Do yourself a favor & try these in a store first. Thank you Amazon for free shipping & return on this product! Make sure if you DO order this, that you choose one with the free return policy, because you're going to need it!"
2,Not for me,"I had to return, the lace was bothering to me and the cup size was more Madonna and me....Amazon was great, quick return and I bought another 18 hour smooth which I love."
3,Comfort but not support,"If you are looking for comfort, then this bra is good, however, the support is not that great if you are large chested."
2,Uggh...comfort should not be a part of the name,"I bought several bras recently to accommodate my growing body (I'm 5 months pregnant). I'm usually a strict Victoria's Secret shopper but didn't want to spend a fortune for ""maternity"" periods. This bra was a disappointment. It's bigger than the Playtex bras I've bought in the same size. It's MASSIVE so I have to be careful what I wear over it as you may see some of the massive panel/cup, and it's just plain uncomfortable. The band at the bottom cuts into my skin and starts to fold over and bend. Maybe I'm just too used to wearing underwire that I can't handle the method of ""support"" of non-underwire bras. Either way, I wouldn't recommend this one. Go with the Playtex Women's Side Smoothing Underwire Bra or the Playtex Women's 18 Hour Active Lifestyle...those are much more comfortable."
3,playtex 18 hour,the product is great a good fit the only problem I have is that I ordered maple leaf colour but I was sent brown instead which I was not very happy about
2,Ordered my regular size - fit all wrong....,"Cups too large. Fabric is too stiff and upper part creeps too far into the armpit, making it not too comfy. The support is okay even w/o a wire, but the other issues negate that fact. Also, it does NOT put your pair into the best shape/silhouette for under clothing. I'd skip this bra but if you must, I'd suggest ordering your normal band size but 1 cup smaller. And then I'd only wear it for around the house, not under clothes."
3,Bra,"Arrived on time, but was a little loose on me. I do like it, but would have liked it more if it had come in one size smaller. Why don't they sell bras in a 36DD??"
4,Very comfortable bra,I have worn Platex for years because I can count on a consistent fit as well as comfort. The lace on this one is bit more pronounced than I anticipated and is best worn under a loose top.
5,Comfort,Very nice with great support.If you want comfort this bra has it!Great price and comfort you can't go wrong.Try to get sized before you purchase. This will help you understand what size will work for you.
1,Bad fit,The bra is really pretty but the fit is not right. The cup size is larger than normal and the placement of the cups are too close together.
4,comfortable but..,i love the look of this bra. it runs a little big for me . I am a 38DD but the size in this particular bra is a bit big. the cups are a little to roomy and the band is at the last link but still not tight enough. I have no pointy cones and I am sure if I go to a 36DD it will fit much tighter..( I like the feel of tight around my chest)..I tried washing and drying in the dryer to shrink but of course it will not shrink
4,Wonderful Discovery!,"This bra is a super, well-fitting product for me. Being a bit larger on one side than the other (no one is perfect...right?), this bra is a real find because of the cups. They seem to cover a multitude of sins, plus this bra is actually sexy for a woman who is large breasted. We usually get stuck with the ""plain Jane"" type of bra that makes us feel less attractive. Since I found it, I've ordered every color and I will be sure to keep several in reserve. I rated this bra as a four star only because the lace is a bit rough in the beginning, but once washed several times it gets softer.Don't hesitate to try this bra.....I think you'll like it!!"
5,great bra,"Most comfortable bra I've ever owned. And I've tried hundreds of styles. Wearing a large size, 48DD, it's not easy to find a bra that feels this soft and still offers support. Note: It does tend to stretch quite a bit after many wearings. Drying it in the clothes dryer (only once in awhile) helps to bring it back to size."
1,Very poor fit in my regular size,"I can usually find something good to say about most products, but not this bra. I ordered my regular size, and the fit is way off. The band is too tight, the cups are too large. Not only are they large, but they're too pointy. I'm not a fan of cone-shaped boobs that stick out in opposite directions. If you decide to order this, I would consider going up a band size and down a cup size. Then again, I just wouldn't order it."
2,Itchy Boob Torpedo,This bra is itchy in between the breasts and underneath. It also looks like a fifties torpedo bra. I feel uncomfortable and self conscious when I wear it and I doubt that I'll ever buy a Platex bra again.
1,Not a good fit,"I received this bra and was very disappointed. The fit is awful, the seam that crosses the cup doesn't lay correctly and it's just ugly on your body.Generally I like playtex bras for everyday wear, but this one is just awful."
5,Very Useful Book!,"I used the book twice to rate myself in 13 distinct areas. The second time was two years after the first so I did not remember individual solutions to the problems. Each time my scores, highs and lows, surprised me. I spent between 5 and 10 minutes per problem solution even though he states that you can spend up to 30 minutes for each.The book provided me with an objective picture of my chess abilities. It also guided me to resources, and the proper use of resources, that provided the training that has helped raise my rating from the 1200's to 1703 over the past five years. Indispensable - if you want an objective evaluation of your strengths and weaknesses."
3,Not for the lower rated player,"The book says it is for the beginning level player or advanced player. Such a book I found very hard and beyond me.I was able to understand about half of it so I have it a half way rating! Probably this book is good for players who are advanced, so I would say it is good for advanced players but not lower level players like me. Do not think I am dum, I am just not that experienced yet. So, I put this book away for another more advanced day!"
2,Not for all levels like it says,"This book is not for all levels like it says on the cover. The author thinks beginners have a deep understanding of the game and does not know the meaning of the word ""beginner"". I will say that the book is good for advanced players. If you are not already a resonably good player and get this book you will find it hard."
3,Mixed Feelings,The book says it is for beginning or expert players. I know the basic stuff and I found it to not explan things too good for an advanced beginner or a kid like me. It is for advanced players.
2,Very dissapointed with colors.,I chose to by this plane on Amazon becuase I specifially wanted to plane to be white not green- the plane I received was green.So I was very dissapointed... .I would have not chosen to buy from Amazon if I new about it.
2,Audible Hiss Noise,"I purchased these speakers and installed them this week. To my shock once plugged in, the two satellite speakers produce a audible hissing noise when the unit is turned on. I disconnected the speakers from my sound card and computer but the hissing noise remained. This told me the source of the noise was coming from inside the unit itself. Even with the speaker volume turned down its lowest setting the hiss is still audible at my normal speaker placement of a yard+ away. I moved the speakers away from my monitor and any other possible source of interference but the noise remained.The music playback with the speakers is excellent. The sound is rich but not over powered by the subwoofer. But again you can still hear the hissing noise with soft music play back.All in all I am very disappointed with this product."
2,Shocking results ... not the good kind mind you,"I WAS quite happy with the quality and sound displayed by this 2.1 system ... that is, until I realized the damage they were doing to my computer. The unit is apparently not well grounded as the mini-jack cable carries VOLTAGE. Thats right, live voltage. I had the misfortune of resting my forearm over the mini-jack connector one day and experienced a sharp pain. Sure enough, I had been shocked by my speaker system. I can't imagine the damage that could have been done had I continued to plug the set into my laptop. And wouldn't you know it ... this comes to my attention 1 month outside my warranty period. Figures."
2,B-Side's Trash by GARBAGE standards,"With a few notable exceptions, you generally do NOT spend 10-plus dollars on a GARBAGE CD single for the remixes, but rather the unreleased B-sides. On that count, most any GARBAGE Maxi-CD is worth buying; but HOOOO boy is this one a waste. ""Driving Lesson"" is hands down their worst one ever. Shirley just whispers and sneers, and Mr. Vig and company seem like they just punched up a canned drumbeat and left the room. I cannot ill-advise any Amazon shopper enough... This CD bites."
5,Excellent resource.,Excellent information for people of all ages. Very easy to read and understand with helpful examples in a variety of credit situations. I would especially recommend this book to high school students and new college freshmen where bad credit starts all too often.
5,Generation xers and thirty some things finally get a clue:,"This book encourages generation x to take stock of their personal finances without references to their being a dummy or an idiot. The approach here is very cordial. The authors encourage shopping for the best fees as well as the lowest interest rates and offer tips toward ,finding affordable health, automobile and homeowners insurance. Gives you an edge so you can limit financial hardships now as you prepare for the future."
5,Fantastic book covering all the basics.,"This book also reveals a few hidden tricks of the creditors and provides information that allows you to be in the driver's seat when dealing with creditors and in general with anything that involves applications or contracts.The information and ideas are presented in a clear and easy to understand manner. Hernan and Schliep do not claim to be experts, never the less they offer pages and pages of useful tips from the beginning of the book to the very end. The glossary of terms gives the reader a hands on understanding of the terms they need when applying for a loan or a lease, If you are looking for ways to better devise a budget, check out the ABCs of Credit and most important of all take a personal inventory of your expenditures."
5,"Less than perfect credit, then don't risk your home equity.","Getting the best deal on a mortgage, understanding your automobile lease, preparing for the future, particularly unemployment or illness that changes completely your earning capability isn't going to come from experts that don't trust you to be able to figure out on your own when you are getting a raw deal."
5,read the small print and pay attention,"I learned to read all the small print and to pay close attention, this means in all service aggreements, credit applications, and contracts. The glossary in this book gives the consumer a heads up on the terms used by vendors and lenders. Watch those percentage points.The first section, Closing the Gap offers insights into weighing your needs against your wants and knowing what you need and howto evaluate some of the services you don't use but pay big bucks for. The Authors aren't preachy. You won't find advice for dummies or idiots here, but then this book is written to provide consumer information as well as personal finace ideas"
4,We need more books like this one.,"A good read. Premature birth can be traumatic for not only mom and dad, but the extended family as well. I have found that there are not enough books on the subject. This author's work adds to the list of quality material available.I would reccomend this book as a companion to Equal to the Task, by Dail R. Cantrell. The books are similiar enough to be read together. Cantrell's book was a Book of the Year nominee, and fills in gaps left by this book. Both books present a powerful message."
3,Average,"It took me about 4 hours to read the book from beginning to end. The book was easy reading and the content was equal to that of a Marketing companies sales pitch. If you are already familiar with industry wide Marketing practices and Customer Service you will find this book repetitive and lacking insight. The worst part about the book would have to be the words ""Just another day in the pawnshop"" used over and over and over and over! I would not recommend this book if you are already intuitive, insightful and embrace change. However, I would recommend this book if you are trying to motivate one of your employees to understand customer expectations."
5,Charming and Insightful,"This book is so much more than business advice. It's about heart. It's about struggle. And it's about the lessons we learn through life, not through the classroom. It is a charming look at a bygone but very relevant era. A great gift!"
3,Light & Fun read,"What it promised to be - an easy, light, fun read that doesn't take itself too seriously. But don't expect a literary masterpiece."
2,"Great Affirmations, But a Poor Value When Compared to Her Other Cds.","I really enjoy Belleruth Naparstek's work. I own and treasure many of her recordings. However, whoever decided the price point for this cd should be ashamed!The package states that it's nearly an hour of affirmations, but it's like only 26 minutes long and they are basically the same affirmations found on some of her other cds. So for the same price of this, instead buy her Combat Depression or General Wellness cds because you get identical affirmations, but also a terrific guided imagery experience too.I wouldn't have written this negative review if the price was adjusted to reflect the amount of content. I think $9.99 would be a more accurate price for what you get. Unfortunately, I got burned on this purchase, but I do hope that other shoppers get to experience her overall spectacular catalogue of self-help products."
4,Good book,We like having a strange assortment of reading material in our main floor bathroom. This one fit right in the collection.
1,Cheap and flimsy,"This was bought for an event and I left it at the venue, I will not miss this one bit."
1,Total waste of money,"This was a total waste of money. I bought it for one time use at a garage sale. This thing couldn't even hold a couple of garments steady without tipping over. What a complete waste of money. Not recommended. Might have worked with some kind of sandbags, but we had to tie it to the roof of our garage to keep it from falling over. Get something with two vertical posts on each side instead of one."
3,for Light Weight clothes,"If you put anything heavier than a couple of dress shirts and slacks, the rack will start to lean. Its great for a short term solution for hanging items after ironing, but anything longer term, definitely not."
4,You Get What You Pay For!,"I bought 4 racks after reading a few reviews on Amazon regarding this product. I realized for the price, their probably meant to hold no more than a few pieces of garment. But, considering I was on a time crunch and I didn't want to invest too much in a ""Garage Sale"" I took a chance. Well...the racks held maybe at the most 15 pieces of clothing ranging from 2 jackets, 2 pairs of jeans, a few silk blouses and cotton tees. I also ended up selling the racks for $10 to get rid of them and save on space (not that they take up too much. So...for temporary use or to place in the laundry room to hold a few pieces of clothing awaiting to be transferred to your closet, I say ""Not a Bad Deal""."
2,Product description is WAY off,"Amazon describes these balls as ""lacquered wood bocce balls"" that come in a ""molded plastic case."" These balls are some sort of resin, NOT lacquered wood. As such, they're a dull color unlike the lacquered wood balls in Amazon's image. Furthermore, the balls come in a nylon soft case (a case that sags when the balls' weight is applied), NOT the molded plastic case seen in the picture. However, the model number on the set I received is the same model number Amazon lists, so I can only guess that the set has changed over time to a cheaper version.My family still enjoys playing with this set, which is why I gave it two stars and not the lower rating it probably deserves."
3,Franklin 3714/01P2 Bocce Set,"As mentioned by another buyer this product is misrepresented in the product description. Neither the bocce balls or the case are as depicted in the pictures. However, the set is serviceable and has a comparable price to similar sets."
2,"Great light, bad bulbs","The lamp arrived very quickly, it is a beautiful design, but the bulbs were horrible. They have 2 prongs on the end to connect to lamp. Impossible to find replacements. My genius husband, converted the sockets to regular bulbs."
5,Great for UPS and Power Strips,"I used to have at least 3 power strips to connect all of computers, monitors and various peripherials. I bought a UPS to replace all of those, and these power cable splitters are great to get all of the power cords hooked up, especially those pesky transformers that take up a lot of space."
4,Nice cables,These are nice and I got them quickly. I might have gotten them cheaper locally but it seems the hardware store ones want to put a large on/off switch at the junction and I don't like that.
5,Power Cable 1-4 Splitter.,Exactly what I was looking for at the office. Will take up fewer power connections for all those monitors. Packaged well and shipped quickly.
4,Good quailty power splitter/liberator,"I was looking for a power squid when I came across this. I had always wanted one without a switch and this fit the bill perfectly. It's a nice heavy gauge cable and looks like it could withstand a lot of wear and tear. I have purchased many Cables to Go Cat5/6 cables in the past and have been totally satisfied with their quality and I would say the same of this. We use this to power a set ofCowboyStudio New Photo Photography Video Studio Umbrella Continuous Lighting Light Kit Set- 2 7ft Stands, 1 Mini Stand and Carry Casewhich goes on location often and can't be accidentally turned off by kicking or stepping on a power toggle so it's even better than what we originally started out looking for since we don't need surge protection for this application."
4,Very nice but a bit expensive,"I really like these, but I think they are a little overpriced, so I'm knocking off a star for that. If money is no object, then I'd give it a full five stars.Pros:* Well constructed and, in many cases, better than using a power strip* Splits into 4 (harder to find than 2-way splitters)* Lifetime warrantyCons:* A bit expensive, 2-way splitters like these can be had for MUCH lessOther:* Made in Taiwan* 1.5 feet long (about 19""), not 1.2 feet like in description"
5,perfect for power adapters,"I use these to hang all the power adapters off a power strip. Instead of wasting space with a bunch of power strips, you can get one power strip with 8 outlets on it and you'll have the room for 32 power adapters! This cable is thick and the plugs are very tight and good quality"
4,Does it's job,"The cords are a bit stiff, but they fit in the back of the Charging Station I bought along with is. Certainly helps to clean up the area!"
5,Four outlet Cord Splitter,"Excellent construction. Eliminates problems encountered when plugging into and unplugging from solid plug-in outlets. One plug can be manipulated without affecting the other three.Only Amazon advertised this special item and though the price was substantial, so is the product."
4,Good extenders,These are very useful and I am glad I purchased them. The prongs seem a little weak though.
5,Good Item,"I have a 4 monitor setup for my computer and used this item to take the 4 plugs down to one and save some space on the power strip.Good price, well made, just what I needed. Not much else to be said."
4,Prevent over crowded power strips.,This was great for expanding an all to crowded power strip. Excellent for making power available for all you peripheral units.
5,"Great Cord, Saves Space....","Great Cord, Saves Space....and well made to boot. I would have liked a lower price but the quality is quite good and I have no doubt that it will remain useful far into the future..."
5,Awesome,"Finally, someone created a power source that will handle the electronic chargers that block both power outlets. These octopus cords deals great with those kinds of issues."
1,misleading,"BEWARE!I was confused by the description at the top claiming 150/case and a price of 4.99, when the item description read 15/pack. I called the Medinet company directly and was told that it is in fact only 15 pads for this price.I can't review quality since I canceled my order."
4,not too bad,"pretty good action movie, u cant tell its low budget but its mainly to show off action star scott adkins, which he does a great job. a lil cheesy but still worth the watch"
4,like it,im a fan of scott adkins i wish i could see him on hollywood movies is fun to see him kicking asses
3,Wrong posture,"We have several Schleich dinosaurs and they are well made. We like them very much and have been impressed with the quality. While I recommend Schleich dinosaurs in general, I don't recommend this one as the T-rex has the wrong posture. To quote wikipedia, ""Like many bipedal dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex was historically depicted as a 'living tripod', with the body at 45 degrees or less from the vertical and the tail dragging along the ground, similar to a kangaroo. [...] By 1970, scientists realized this pose was incorrect and could not have been maintained by a living animal, as it would have resulted in the dislocation or weakening of several joints, including the hips and the articulation between the head and the spinal column."""
1,"boring, waste of time. zero plot","This movie is terrible. The plot builds up to nothing in the end, what a waste of time. The beginning half the movie follows a group of soldiers fighting which then promptly just disregards and forgets about.wheres the continuity? Then even worse the movie just ends, as if they ran outta movie or film and thats it. Don't waste your money. A michael bay movie has more of a plotline then this does."
4,As good as I remembered,"I saw this movie first run when I was living in Stockholm in 1968. It was amazing then, and just as good when rewatched recently. All Peter Watkins' movies are worth watching; this one is worth owning."
2,Ok chip net,"This net is alright. Not great. The picture shows that the net comes to a point at the bottom. Is it tied? Glued? No, you have to tie it yourself. Basically, when you get the chipping net - the net is open on both ends. How the picture shows the top open - this is how the bottom is. You have to bundle it up and tie it yourself. So at the bottom of the net is a bunch of extra netting - which is the knot - after you tie it of course. This chipping net seems to only work well outside. Comes with two hooks to anchor the base. These hooks have to be pushed into something soft - like the ground, grass, sand, etc. If you use it indoors and can't anchor it down, when you chip into it, the net will fall over backwards. It's an ok net for the price. The construction isn't the best - you could probably do better making one yourself."
3,Funny and Humerous,"I found Michael York's book to be funny and very humerous.He injects his English wit into his life story w/is a joy to read.He starts w/his birth and goes on form there.It is a funny documentation of his life,rise in the theater and everything in between.This book is a must for Michael York Fans."
2,Better versions of Weiss are available,"The date of 2009 is incorrect; this originally came out at least 10 or 15 years ago. It was my introduction to S.L. Weiss and for that I am very grateful, but it appears that Naxos ended up going with Robert Barto's multiple recordings, all of which came after this one. It is easy to see why - Barto's are cleaner, more precise and just a step above."
2,Not Impressed,"Where have all the good script writer's gone? There was so much potential... even a good story line, but a big let down on the ending. Remember the ending from ""The planet of the Ape's,"" you could feel the emotional implication when he realized why the world had changed. The ending to Doomsday 2012 gave us nothing but fluff. This is not a movie I would keep in my ""worth a repeat"" cabinet."

3,viral art against tragedy,"this is the end, the warning couldn't easily be transmitted. Esoteric babble's only rational purpose: the defeat of censorship.the transmission is inhibited, but it is two clicks away: name then address- the WordThis movie had its ups and downs. The special FX could have been better. one thumb up, one thumb down.just kidding, well worth watching.no, it was actually just ok."
5,Just wish I had bought the one big enough for adults...,"Seldom do products deliver on their hype this much. Easy to setup, easy to use. The kids LOVE it. I was a little worried by the reviews that had problems with durability. However, ours has had no problems at all. Leads me to believe that some of the people with negetive results just got a couple of defective products, and tha the line as a whole is solid.The only complaint I have is: I wish we had bought the bigger one so I could go on it."
2,Our slide is defective,"We have had the slide for less than 2 weeks, my kids played on it a hand full of times and already we have ripped seams and crackling in the material. If water pools up just a little on the end the slide flatens at the end making a hard landing. What's worse is that after having these problems I retrieved the box so that we could pack it all up and return it, but it can't be returned to the store and states that once the slide has been taken out of the box and used it can't be returned for a refund. I hope that doesn't apply to a defective slide because ours is literally falling to pieces, I expected more for $160.00."
2,"Great Slide, does'nt last long...","We purchased this slide last year, and yes, we did get about 10-15 uses out of it last year and about 3 uses this year, but after less than 20 uses it is no longer usable! The lining inside the fabric part is wearing away and the product doesnt hold air as it should, there is no way to fix this. The toy is GREAT, and the kids had an absolute BLAST on it, but after only a little over one summers use, it has expired. I think overall, I got my moneys worth, but it was disappointing to only be able to use it one full summer :( Just want to warn others of this so you can make a decision on its worth to you!"
4,Good ROI,"We purchased this slide for two reasons: 1) the waterslide itself, and 2) the blower fan - which can cost $[...] by themselves. The slide has been lots of fun and the blower fan (FJ25) does double duty with a Little Tykes Spiral Bouncer. The water slide has been fun for our daughter and their invited friends - with adult supervision."
5,Probably the greatest new age CD ever made,"I used to listen to this CD when I lived in Melbourne, Australia. Along with good drink, fine friends and this soundtrack in the background, the evening would be like a journey.We were always amazed that Between Tides hadn't become some sort of international best seller.So, snap up the CD while you can and pass the secret along."
5,One of my favorite books!,"My younger siblings had this book when they were growing up and it was one of my favorites to read with them, so I knew I had to get it for my daughter! It's such a cute story and I love the illustrations."
5,Excellent book!,My son is 9 years old and loves this book. It is as if the author understands him and his fears as a little boy with too much of an active imagination.
3,Good Book but........,"It is a great book very well done but...... my 4 year old daughter liked the story unfortunately, now she is scared to go to sleep because she thinks there is an aligator, that mommy and daddy cant see, under her bed. This is no fault of the book but teachers need to prepair parents for possible fallout."
5,Growing up,I read this book when I was a child. I am now in college and writing a paper on my favorite children's book. This is definitely it. I used to read the pages over and over again. I love the illustrations that bring the story to life. I also love There's Something in my Attic and There's a Monster in my Closet.
5,very special,I bought this book at a library book sale. My 3yr. old grandaughter now knows it by heart! The pictures and story are delightful.Mercer Mayer knows how children think!
3,GARY'S GANG...Re-Mixed is simply NOT GOOD,If you read the Kely Jones review...that's really true. The double Gary's Gang CD set is BAD...NOT GOOD. The original recording still be the best. Also the list on the CD # 2 has 14 tracks but on CD it's only 13...in other words...the Gary's Gang CD producers are not serius people.Better to quit.
2,Truth be told: pretty lame,"The paper quality is poor, and the colors are washed out and not at all crisp. If you already own ""Men without Ties,"" you can definitely skip this book."
4,Like I remember......kinda,"When I was a kid, I waited all year for this episode of WWOS. I really like the way they combined the modern interviews with the racing, but there didn't seem to be as MUCH racing footage as I remember. All in all though, this is a great DVD for those of us who remember what it was like to ride air-cooled dual shock MX bikes. It's almost poetic justice that Marty Moates was the first American to win. The Euros soon knew that we had tons of talented riders who could win because they raced against the best every week. Godspeed Marty and Danny- you guys put us on the map."
2,out of date software for out of date computers,"well the seller did say i could send it back, i never did, it's out of date don't work with xp/vista so it's for win95/98 not many computers running that anymore"
4,AL DI LA,"Sorry, but the original song AL DI LA is by Emilio Periccolli, and you can find it in a CD callled Italianissimo II, which you can actually buy from Amazon.com This is the song from the film!"
1,Rome Adventure,"This is a great movie, but the DVD is definately poor quality. I returned the first copy I received because the movie was jumpy and was skipping in multiple places through out the movie. The replacement copy was the exact same way. It skipped in the same exact places in the movie as the first copy I received. I am returning it too and just asking for a refund. I hope that they eventually come out with a good quality version of this movie."
4,Rome Adventure,"I saw this film in 1962 just days after returning from a tour of Italy. While not a classic film by any means, I was totally won over and was back in Italy again. Whenever I watch it and listen to Max Steiner's wonderful score I can practically smell Rome. It was titled 'Lovers Must Learn' here in the UK, and was never released on VHS here. I had to get a copy from the USA. I would like to add a plea to Warner Bros to release this film on DVD. It has a real nostalgia quotient attached to it, even more so due to the recent sad demise of Suzanne Pleshette.Peter Locke, Jarrow, UK"
1,Bad Bad Copy,I too placed an order for this movie. I love all the old Warner Bros. films.I love the music from this picture.What a disappointment because of the poor quality of the DVD. It goes from color to black and white and back again and the sound quality is terrible.I called Amazon and made them aware of this. Don't waste your time or money.
1,rome adventure,"this seller should let you know this is not a color dvd and it is in english with english subitles, very annoying. I am returning mine, do not waste your money on this dvd."
1,WAIT FOR THE WARNER BROS RELEASE,"I should have paid more attention to the description of this DVD. I thought that it was the official WB release, finally, on DVD. This is an import from Hong Kong, and let me tell you, my WB VHS tape is of far better quality. The sound is great, but the color is completely washed out and the picture runs right out of the frame. In the famous ""Al Di La"" scene, Suzanne Pleshette's nose is cut in half. Don't waste even $8.99 on this version; wait until Warner Brothers releases it. If you must have it now; buy the VHS tape. I'm not kidding!"
2,Poor quality DVD,I really enjoy this movie. However I wish it would come out on a quality DVD. This one made overseas has very poor picture and sound. Don't waist your money as I did buying this one.
5,Romance,"Must admit that this is one of my favorites. I introduced my husband to the movie and on occasion we watch it with a good bottle of wine, cheese and fruit. Makes for a romantic evening. Good acting and characters. Some great footage of Italy."
5,An Old Favorite,"I enjoyed seeing this old favorite again...and now it's mine to watch anytime. I have begun collecting a lot of the older movies you don't find in the stores that easily -and I have found every one I've looked for at Amazon.com. This is yet another Amazon Verified Purchase for me, and as always it arrived in good time and great condition."
3,Al Di La,"I found the cd that contains the very song Al Di La from the film Rome Adventure. The title of the cd is Viva Italia! Festive Italian Classics, track 19-Al Di La-Frankie Fanelli (from the film Rome Adventure)."
2,Barely watchable...,"The caption above pretty much sums up this bomber. It's only half-way viewable, and it isnt' helped any by Troy Donahue.Do yourselves a favor if you are even looking at this review. Get ""ROMAN HOLIDAY"" instead. My God, it's so much better than this tripe. But, to some extent, it's like comparing ""Bill and Ted's Dumb Adventure"" to ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Casablanca.""This is a knock-off film, hopelessly trying to be something it isn't, wasn't, or never can/will be. Again, go for Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in ROMAN HOLIDAY.You'll thank me for it."
3,Rome Adventure,"The movie displayed Rome and the country of Italy admirably, displaying many of my favorite statuary and coveying the country-side charm of the outdoors."
4,Sweet Innocence,Another heart-tugging Delmer Daves production with the usual lush score from Max Steiner. Cinematography sometimes steals the scene from the players. Pleshette never looked more lovlier and vulnerable. A very watchable soap opera.
4,Will make you want to go to Italy!,It may seem mushy and corny but I enjoyed the beautiful scenery and felt like I was along for the ride.
4,"gorgeous scenery, gorgeous cinematography (a loner from nyc)",the film's cinematography outweighs the plot of the film. the film's story is too corny and predictable but this film is worth seeing if you want a glimpse of the eternal city... even before you plan to visit Italy. the music score is touching and endearing. i think that suzanne pleshette did very well for a newcomer...and Troy Donahue is not bad to look at... and the song AL-DI-LA will just melt your heart in every way.
5,Still as fresh as when it was new!,"I was going through old cds that I found in a box and stumbled across this one. I plugged it in thinking 'this is gonna sound old and stale'. I was suprised when it didn't. I then remembered why it had always been my favorite Front Line Assembly album. Since my finding of this old gem I""ve gotten a couple newer FLA albums and in my opinion..TNI still is one of their best if not the best music FLA ever made. If you like good electronic music done right, this album is a must have in your collection."
5,sheer genius!,"You will not be sorry. This is pure brilliance. Quintessential it is. The building of a song -- the foreplay leading to the climax -- FLA does this flawlessly -- each component, each layer, perfect and deliberate. These are beautifully crafted pieces. Other adjectives apply: magnificent, mesmerizing, exhilirating, intensely moving and fully satisfying -- satisfying but making us want MORE MORE MORE!!"
3,Case,Just like any old i-pod silicon case. Only problem is that it is a loose fit somewhat and harder to push the already small buttons on the side.
5,Only the best,I had purchased the off-brand replacement cartridges trying to save some money. (They cost about 2/3 as much as the HP ones.) After a little while all of my prints started coming out with streaks. Installing HP cartridges immediately solved the problems. I tried to save a little money and spent a lot more.
3,Pricey - But Works,"I'm a little frustrated that I could buy a whole new printer for the price of a set of toner cartridges... But HP isn't the only vendor to use this design / marketing strategy.As other reviews have pointed out, these are far more reliable than third party cartridges."
4,Pricey But Great Quality!,These carts work like they're supposed to without any problems - I attribute that to their design and that they're still being manufactured in Japan. I wish they lasted longer or were less pricey though.
1,Normal old drama,"Nothing much really to say! I might not be the right person to judge this movie, or this movie is so cold and not excited. Before I write my review I saw what others said about it in imdb website. It has got 4 out of 10! The reason why I bought this movie was the price. It was inexpensive and I like drama, but this one lacks lots of what real drama is. Some people may have other opinions and I do respect all opinions."
3,Oil Additive,"This is the second time I've used this product. Last time was 40k miles ago. Seems to help quiet down engine noise and run smoother. This is the alternative to slick 50 with teflon. Slick 50 Synchron is not available anymore, that I know of. I can't find it anywhere. Change your oil every 3k and don't worry about it."
2,Disappointing,"These are disappointing. The cotton material is fairly comfortable. They are sized extremely generously, and even after shrinking in the wash they are still loose. I would recommend buying a size smaller than normal if you like a close fit.After three washings however the collar is already curling. I'd put the overall quality at average, which makes the price overly steep and not worth it.I'll be going back to 5.11 undershirts at a much higher price, and using these as sleeping shirts."
1,Isolated review of the Qur'an which ignores history,"My objection is that you can not gain the purported understanding by ignoring the Qur'an in its entirety or the historical application of the writing. If I write ""peace is good"" on a slip of paper, but in historical practice in religious ceremonies preach that the way to obtain this peace is by killing others; Dehumanize those who do not follow my slip of paper so as to make killing them easier; teach children that the way to achieve my peace is by commiting suicide in a fashion which kills others....can you really draw conclusion about my slip of paper religion in a vaccuum? I think it is written well, but it lacks real world perspective and remains to isolated in its perspective to provide useful insight. Peace is good."
2,Incomplete and Misleading Introduction to Islam,"This book's biggest strength is the visual beauty of the illustrations and the aural beauty of the accompanying CD. The book's biggest weakness (and it is a major one) is the inadequate and incomplete view it gives of the Koran and the Muslim faith. Readers are never allowed to ""approach the Qur'an"" in its entirety. Rather, they are only permitted to read highly selective verses of the Koran which are deemed the most palatable and the least shocking to Westerners. These verses portray the religion as tolerant and peace-loving..."
1,Absoutlety Rubbish,"If you want to know about the Quran, you better read the Quran and then try to look for contradictions if you find any. I am a jewish convert to Islam and I have taken strong attention to any thing said about the Quran, or what have been said about it. And Mr.Sells is just repeating what some christian and jewish apologists are saying. His book is not built upon any credible evidence.Conclusions: Dont read it!"
3,"Lumex Chrome Grab Bar, 32""","Not as good as others we had installed professionally in another bathroom. This had no rubber gasket to mount under the mounting plates. I had to use silicone caulk to apply under the plate. Without it, the risk is that water will drip down the tile wall, get behind the plate, and get into the mounting holes, and into the wall, to damage plaster and wallboard behind. The directions did not address this issue in any way.With the holes as they are, there is no way to hit a stud even with one-half of the supplied stainless steel screws. I had to drill 9/16"" holes through ceramic tile and plaster to use ""molly"" type anchors. In addition I had to buy stainless steel machine screws to replace the zinc plated screws that come with anchors. If you don't use stainless screws, you are sure to have rust in the shower"
5,Nice Shower Bar,Very easy to install. We like that it's not slippery like some we have seen. It has a good grip area on it.
5,Very Happy!,"I made this purchase for my dad. When I recieved the items, I was very happy to see the item was exactly what I expected to be. Once it was mounted, I came to the conclusion that Amazon is the way to go for online shopping. Thanks!"
3,Fancy a huddle?,"Greg Williams is an upcoming British football star whose professional life is going up, while his personal life seems adrift due to his searches for a boyfriend. After a sexual encounter with his best friend Matt who's to be soon married, Greg can no longer hide his feelings for Matt, but Matt avoids Greg at all costs. After leading his team to the championships, Greg gives Matt a bachelor party where the two reconnect and finally decide where their futures lie. Filled with hot sex and with a rather good story, ""Man On!"" is a good example of what an erotic novel can be."
2,Isn't this all wrong?,"This is supposed to be a triology based on the novels by Jinyong.1. The Legend of the Condor Heroes2. The Return of the Condor Heroes3. The Heavenly Sword and the Dragon SaberThere are many versions of these series. The current picture shown for this product is wrong... Li Yifei stars in the 2006 version of ""The Return of the Condor Heroes."" So which series is this? The first one or the second?"
3,horrible english subtitle !!,"I'm giving 3 stars for the dvd quality, not the drama itself, for two reasons:- The english subtitle is REALLY bad... there are mistakes in translation and also the grammar is improper, as if being translated by a 5th-grader. The transliteration is also wrong. Xiao Long Nu calls him Guo'er, not Gor!- The picture is grainy, letter-boxed, and the subtitles appears in big ugly yellow in between the black bars. For those with widescreen hdtv and would like to see Liu Yifei in all her beautiful glory will be disappointed."
1,Return of the Condor Heroes 2006,"I was so looking forward to this series - I know this from tv, but alas! All NINE dvds in the box are defective, I don't know how it is possible. So now I just have nice box to look at :-( Thank you, Tai Seng."
4,really good,"i rented this movie just because i love kungfu movies, little did i now, it realy hooked me, the fight seens were very good and lots of it, but what realy got me was the love between gor and his master dragon girl, and i hate love story's, but they realy look good together, they made this movie work,to tell you the truth i almost cryed on some parts, this movie got me hooked on the series type, the only reason i didngive it a 5 star was the big condor,computer animal's, and 1 that got me was that gor's uncle's little girl didnt get her arm chopped of bye her dad, i would of raely injoy'd it, lol, owww and the witch was realy hot, she just needed a man to tame her, if i loved this movie i think you will."
2,Soundtrack....,"Speaking about the 2006 Version: What is up with the music...Harry Potter, Van Helsing...It was driving me absolutely nuts to the point I had to watch it muted or just cry at the stupidity of it all. Otherwise it's good but WHY THE MUSIC ><"
3,GOOD ALBUM,"I like Eddy Grant. The only reasons I bought this album is because of the songs ""Electric Avenue"" and ""Romancing the Stone"". I remember when MTV used to play the video for ""Electric Avenue"" all the time and I love the song ""Romancing the Stone"", from the movie. I wanted that song so bad and the movie soundtrack is no longer made, so I had to get this album. The best part of the song ""Romancing the Stone"" is the short guitar solo. It was awesome. In the MTV video, Eddy Grant does the guitar solo on the top of a mountain peak and the view around him was amazing. Eddy Grant was good."
4,Worth Reading,"Four Christmas Angels definitely help to bring out the best in Eben. He's a bit rough around the edges, but don't give up on him. Maggie is a delightfully strong character. She doesn't let Eben get away with anything. There are plenty of laughs, some tears, some growing pains, etc. Generally a very enjoyable book."
3,Doesn't do justice to the subject,"Jerry Lee Lewis's rise to fame and marraige to his 13-year-old cousin are given a superficial treatment. Dennis Quaid, Winona Ryder, and other cast members do a good job, but the screenplay glosses over certain details of his life without going into much depth."
1,Forget it,"Don't even waste your time with this one, it was a horrible movie. Yes, the soundtrack was good--the background music-- but this production is on the level of a Disney Network show produced for teenagers. Not worth your time."
2,"Not bad, but then not good","This is okay. Dennis Quaid is rather over the top and Winona Ryder is her usual humdrum self. Looks good and there are some good comedic touches.However, rather than his career being trashed by the scandal depicted here, in that he marries his 13 year old cousin, and then she gets pregnant, and slaps her about, he should have been jailed. Sorry, distasteful is not the word for it."
4,Great balls of fire!,"Well if one likes Jerry Lee's music this one is OK. After all it is not Dennis who actually plays and sings. It is the killer himself who takes care of that. Dennis is well over the top in this flick but nevertheless it still is an item I love to see over and over - and it looks great on my 95 inch screen also.Probably it is the music that makes it worthwhile but the impact of the big screen in my home cinema helps a great deal too. And young Wynona Ryder does look sweet and innocent and as some people would say - she is easy on the eye. Well I always liked her too, so...."
3,Exciting Dennis...Boring Winona,"When I saw the preview for this movie, I thought ""wow, Dennis Quaid is hot."" I'm too young to remember Jerry Lee Lewis, but I have heard his music. Dennis Quaid does an admirable job of bringing Jerry Lee Lewis' story to us.Winona Ryder is okay. I think she's a wishy-washy actress. Sometimes she's great, sometimes she bores me. Unfortunately, this was one of the boring performances. Granted, she was playing a whiny teenager, that may have swayed my opinion.The story is a good one, but now I intend to read a biography about Jerry Lee Lewis, as I'm sure much was left out about this man's colorful life.As an aside, my pre-teen daughter had many questions about the behavior of the two cousins...so I probably should have watched it when she was not around.Bottom line, if you are huge fan of either actors or the story, buy it...otherwise, rent it."
2,Hollywood doesn't do Rock and Rollers justice,"Oh, MAN........you thought that insult to Johnny Cash, ""I Walk The Line"" was bad? I mean, Reese Witherspoon playing June? Ugh, that's ALMOST ""The Last Waltz"" or ""Gimme Shelter"" compared to this tripe (the operative word there is ""almost""). Dennis Quaid does a LOT...an AWFUL lot...of ""mugging,"" but it's worse than Jehosaphat Phoneix affecting Johnny Cash's snarl. And Winona Ryder just...DOESN'T project the...""jailbait quality"" of Myra Lewis. She's just too old. Do yourself a favor: grab any compilation of The Killer's performances during the 60's/70's...on upward, and alight on the ""Last Man Standing"" DVD where he has a decent backup band for the first time, almost, in his career."
4,the real jerry lee lewis,"Dennis Quaid does a very good job of playing JERRY LEE LEWIS but the music performed by the real Jerry Lee Lewis is the hit of the movie. Jerry will be 67 years old in september of this year and can still rock as hard as anyone. there is only one JERRY LEE LEWIS. Do yourself a favor and see him while you can. As they say in the movie, Jerry Lee is playing his heart out somewhere in America tonight."
4,Jerry Lee's Story With His Own Music,Dennis Quaid plays Jerry Lee Lewis in this movie. Jerry Lee does his own music. The movie is a three star and the music is a five star. This movie is the true story of the life of Jerry Lee Lewis and a wonderful showcase for the artist's own music performed by himself.
5,Love it,I love this movie. Its one of my all time fav movies. I watch it all the time! Very happy with it
1,No info on product given!!!!!,"No where did it say in the order that if shipped to the USA that it doesn't work in our zone!! Really upsetting, ruined a Xmas gift!!!! Wont order again!!!!!!!!"
2,Kind of Stupid,"I really like Jerry Lee Lewis but this movie was poorly done and not believable due to overacting and character miss match, especially for Sam Phillips who was much younger in real life at that time and who was much more professional than portrayed in this movie. Even the so called ""British Accent"" was so fake that it was stupid. ""Walk the Line"" and ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and ""Ray"" were much, much better. If I were from the South I would have been deeply offended by this movie and the constant stereotyping of southerners as swaggering uneducated drunks. The only good of this movie was the music."
2,leaky,"Bought it as a gift, and we both like the appearanc and engraving. But he isn't able to use it as it leaks everywhere."
4,momma why?,"... i will agre with this subject.pelope need to put a stop to all the abuse .i can imagine how many young inocen""t children being abuse and not saying anything .there is people walkingaround with blind fold on they needto wake up and do something abountthis if we people can come together and if we all work together we can make a difference.i have farth in GOD?i rate this **** i do here carying at night"
3,Filling in What the Media Neglects,"If your interesting in knowing the truth about one of the 1990s most important foreign policy personalities, this book won't necessarily help. While it is an easy read with lots of details about what was happening behind closed doors, Ms. Albright also spun it to her own advantages. But that is to be expected. Considering her harsh handing at the hands of the right wing, it is good to get her point of view."
2,If you want to learn more about her as a person fine but lacking insights into important issues of her time,"This tape provides a very good personal history of her as a person but, unfortunately, very little with respect to analysis of policies and issues when she was foreign secretary. There is very little discussion as to how and why major foreign policy decisions were made, interaction of the main players in these decisions, what goals (short and long term) were and other aspects involving foreign policy decisions and strategies. All these should have been discussed. Is this not why someone buys a book like this to begin with? It's as if the book defeats its purpose."
3,Mixing business and politics.,"Powerful and smart, persistent and captivating. All that sounds very convincing. The things that is missing - making money from the conflicts and destruction.One could not find in this book a single word about making money on the post-war privatization in what used to be Serbia. They targeted 200+ publicly owned production facility but only couple of tanks. Then, Madam Secretary's firm was making sure, that its clients could get those factories for peanuts. Nobody could account for all activities by Albright Group LLC in the world, but its latest role in ""helping"" Kuwait with Iraqi debt is well covered in the latest edition of ""The Nation"" magazine(...)Someone will call it politics, others will call it business. Billion here, billion there - who cares, US taxpayers will cover all those debts and pay the price for the high ranking war profiteering."
1,A Political Resume,"I found it funny that this book was referred to as an autobiography in a previous review. I also thought it would be an autobiography when I saw her on TV pushing it. This reads like a political resume for a position in the next democratic cabinet (like vice-president). I would say she is as qualified as, say Dan Quayle, to be VP but unless you are a Democrat you might not finish this book which is a puff piece that reads as if her mother wrote it. I also found sections to be disingenuously vague. I'm glad I picked it up at the library and didn't pay for it."
1,Disappointing biography,"Although I generally like biographies, this was a major disappointment. A sparse 90 pages..read in less than one hour, with even grammatical errors were a major disappoiontment.Don't bother!"
2,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LAPTOPS?,"I was amazed that Ms Albright wrote this book with obvious pride and markets it so heavily. One would have thought that her failed administration would quietly slink away and hope not to be questioned about her public performance.Will she never stop her shameless self promotion and constant whining about the current president? If only she had courage, conviction and imagination she could perhaps have saved America from the terrible attacks of 911. If only she could have apologized for the selling of State secrets to foreign governments........if only she could account for the lost or stolen laptops from her own office. I fear she was too busy defending her boss and playing the aging courtier. The book is an insult to all Americans and a transparent attempt to vindicate a pathetic performance as Secretary of State."
4,Behind the Iron Curtain,"Madeleine provides behind the scene insight into the fall of the Iron Curtain/Berlin Wall and the introduction of a free market economy in Central and Eastern Europe. Shortly after reading her Memoir I toured nine countries along the Danube and saw the importance of the spark of freedom that her father passed along to her. One person made a difference; especially one with her energy, language skills, and cultural familiarity. This book gives all of the nitty gritty details that made her the woman she is and gave her the strength to be the right person at the right time to usher in major changes in that part of the world. Fascinating!"
2,pls no more shadings,"this book is an injustice to the reader,because it is simply not telling the truth. for example the author states that the clinton adminstation was heavily montoring al queda and was doing everything it could to stop Bin Laden. then the author should tell us that pres. clinton met only twice with his original cia director. we now have more information coming out. i am afraid this book like others in the adminstration will be shown to spend so little time in foreign affairs. i do believe that the author is an outstanding person of character but please stop covering up for a president interested in domestic affairs. he will be remembered for not stopping bin laden when he could have."
1,a failed Secretary of State,This woman is a total idiot. Remember North Korea? I wouldn't let her negotiate a second hand shoe bargain for me in a flea market.
1,More Revisionist History from Clinton Admin. Left Overs,"This book is more revisionist history from a woman who danced with dictators, appeased war criminals and spoke angrily and bitterly (in French, no doubt) about the United States and its president while on foreign soil. Unfortunately, her best conspiracy theory isn't included herein--that is, her theory that Bush has Osama and is waiting to reveal him at a politically opportune time. Sorry Madeline, you had your chance and you appeased the terrorists. It's time to retire to academia or the speaker circuit espousing your failed policies. This book is a great head start.Isn't it wonderful, how this country afforded her so much as a former Czech refugee? Isn't it terrible how she ends up ""biting the hand that fed her"" for so many years?Madeline Albright was a miserable failure as secretary of state and is an embarassment to this country.Save your money unless of course you enjoy reading well-written revisionist fiction.[...]"
1,Lite-Albright,"Lite-Albright,Making things up with Albright.What a sight,Making things up with Albright!"
5,Candor,"There is nothing ordinary about her: her heritage, her history, her family, her career... Every single part of her life is so amazing... But this book offers you the most fascinating feature that makes her: candor.... Especially the part, where all the glorious days of office are over, strikes the reader with this candid definition of feelings which, I am sure, requires a great deal of courage... I wish, those who based their reviews here on their own political agenda, could be fair enough to acknowledge at least this courageous effort immune of any political or personal ambitions... Anyway, congradulations Madame Secretary!!!"
5,Evocative and Fascinating,"Rumer Godden is one of my all-time favorite writers. Her books are compelling and transformative. She has an understanding of human nature, particularly within the culture she grew up in, that makes her more than a ""novelist."" This book is one of her best."
3,Adonis,"....sounds like a story that could be straight from the 'jetset' crowd...I can't believe I read the whole thing...although the author did give incite into the happenings of one big party to the next...once you ever get past that, which is from one chapter after another you can relate to what the main characters were up against...I was at first interested in this book because of the 'adonis' factor...I wonder if this author was telling her own story...and I wonder why I read the darn book.......oh well, I'll just tell you I hope she decides to choose a new topic in her other books...she could be worth the read if that happens....I feel generous and 3stars is being generous...."
3,Fair over all view of the pacific war,"Fairly good over all view of the war against Japan. To me it seems as the author believes that the British suffered the most, were the only troops who fought in jungles, were subjected to desease, etc and ultimately were the ones who actually defeated the Japs, with a little help from the United States and Australia, etc. Good maps, though. I was disappointed that the account of Tarawa, Peleliu and Iwo Jima were so brief. Maybe it was because the Brits didn't participate in those battles. Burma, Hong Kong, Malaya were more important.I was hoping to be enlightened on the campaigns at Bougainville, New Georgia, Cape Gloucester, Kwajalein, Eniwetok etc but I don't know more about those campaigns than I did before reading the book. I recommend the ""The Pacific War Atlas"" as an introduction to the war against Japan."
4,Great Overview of the Pacific Theater,"In 141 pages Smurthwaite has condensed the major engagements, both land and sea, of the Pacific Theater. The strength of this work is its brevity and the huge number of useful maps. While reading other more detailed accounts of various engagements, I would frequently reach for this book and the pertinent map. Brief it may be but not a word is wasted in providing a brilliant summary.A great companion for ""The Two-Ocean War"" by Samuel Eliot Morrison"
4,One of their best!!,"I honestly believe that these guys cannot make a bad cd. The production on this one is great. It is more polished than previous albums and not as raw but it has a 'freshness' to it that was very welcome to my ears.There are some very good songs on this cd as can be expected by this band. The opening song 'Wheels' is one that you can get hooked on with the first listen. '5 Smiles Away' has a Beatles influence that works very well with the song. You also have the nice ballad 'You And I' that shows a bit more of the vocal talent of Donnie Vie. There is also a cool John Lennon cover on this cd with the song 'Jealous Guy' that fits in great for this album.I highly recommned this album to any fan of this band or those who like Cheap Trick,The Beatles,or great music in general."
1,Terrible side of the band,"This side of Enuff Z'Nuff is just horrible , I don't like this album because it's way too pop and it shows no interest in me . Fans of Enuff Z'Nuff should get Enuff Z'Nuff , Strength or Paraphernalia becuase those albums are terrific !"
4,A good version of one of Shakespeare's lesser plays,"Even setting aside the issue of anti-Semitism, ""Merchant Of Venice"" is not one of Shakespeare's better plays -- it is inherently a bit flat and lacks internal drama. Also, it is billed s a comedy, but there isn't much funny about it. Wisely, director Michael Radford hones in on the tragic aspects of the play, heightening the twin tragedies of Shylock and Antonio. Al Pacino plays Shylock to the hilt, avoiding an interpretation that has him appear either sinister or victimized: this Shylock is a powerful man, greatly angered, and in the famous ""Does he not bleed?"" speech, there is not a hint of self-pity. I agree that there is a flatness to this production, but I'm not sure i entirely the fault of Radford or his cast. (Axton)"
3,Film vs Stage,"To meet the requirements of an actor crossing the line from a stage performance of a Shakespeare play to a cinematic role is not easy. Pacino succeeds; he plays the Shylock role quite convincingly. For me however, the other protagonists are not quite up to the mark.The movie is beautifully filmed with spectacular settings. There is one clummsy transition between two segments but otherwise the technical side of the film is fine. This is where it earns its 3 stars . Pacino's performance alone is not enough to raise it to 4 stars.On a finer scale I would give this film 7 stars out of ten."
1,Too bad I'll have to forego...........,"The many reviews I have read of ""The Merchant of Venice"" make me thirst nearly unbearably to purchase this DVD. However, I cannot, for it offers no English subtitles, which I need to get the most out of a movie. Especially Shakespeare, whose language is difficult enough to begin with.I have ""Much Ado About Nothing"" which I adore & which does have subtitles. Will look for others."
3,Something Missing,"Something is missing from this adaptation.It just doesn't hang together well and it is hard for me to put my finger on exactly why.Schlock is too overbearing and totally unsympathetic, a one dimensional lump. He doesn't anguish so much for his daughter as he is just nastily pissed off about the loss of lucre.His, is a Jew not a man.... speech is delivered drearily and without humanity almost like he is complaining about a traffic ticket.Rachael's part is diminished and this leaves an annoying void.Still I am not saying don't get this DVD. The filming in Venice is well done and while a lot of mammary glands are swung around it is not too overbearing. In the end I have to say that it is good to see any Shakespeare adaptations done with first rate actors no matter if the result is less than stellar."
1,Culture war,"This film starts with an extreme anti-Christian theme that is not part of the play. We did not watch the entire DVD--could not stomach it. The play itself has anti-semitic themes. We wondered how this would be sensitively portrayed. Given the anti-Christian message before they play even began, we surmised that the entire thing was a diatribe against faith and did not stay to see that played out. We threw this in the trash rather than passing it on as we do not want to add any extra fuel to the culture at war with faith."
3,what's the purpose of remaking this movie again?,"well, this one might still piss off the modern day jewish people again, since they are used to cry social unjustice for bashing them again and again with no probable or justifiable causes.but what's the purpose of making or watching this movie? to watch the shrunk-under-aging-process al pacino spitting sliva in court publicly? watching those two women with fake moustache and beard? watching so many women exposed their chests as a fashion of that era? 1 lb flesh of antonio as an irrevocable payment deliquent penalty? several boxes for the suitors to choose from and only the lucky one got it right? come-on, this was not one of william shakespere's best works, okay? the whole storyline simply showed a messy directing and editing. one more thing to ponder: are italians used to be all with olive darker skin and dark black hair? why so many blond and different colored people in this movie? were the italian began their inter-racial marriages so long ago?"
4,The classics presented the way they should be,Read this in High School...read this in college...put me to sleep both times...but put on the big screen with first rate actors...well lets just say it made me a shake-man fan...
3,Merchant of Venice,"This is a good version of the play, but since I am a school teacher - let me give you a big heads up - there are a lot of bare-chested women in this that does nothing to further the plot. It's my husband's opinion that they are there so that men will watch the movie. The other problem is that this version is trying so hard to be politically correct that it bends Shakespeare's meaning to suit a twenty-first century audience. I feel this is done in such a way as to cause problems with the basic plot."
3,gratuitous nudity,"While this film is a relatively accurate and well acted version of the Shakespeare play, it has nudity in it where none is called for. This makes it unusable in the American classroom and cheapens the play itself."
2,Wish it had subtitles!!!,"We tried but Shakespeare WITH subtitles is difficult enough...without, forget it. This one had all the makings for one of our favorite movie genres...the acting, the costumes, and the scenes all looked fab but without understanding the dialog made it too frustrating to follow.Sorry, but unless you can really grasp Shakespeare I don't recommend."
1,"If you don't support animals being killed in the making of films, then skip this film.","Unfortunately, I didn't watch this entire film because near the beginning they slit the throat of a live lamb. This film could have been made without hurting animals.""The certification ""No Animals Were Harmed"" does not literally mean that no animals were harmed. A movie, television show, commercial, music video or short film earns the ""No Animals Were Harmed"" certification if the production meets or exceeds AHA's (American Humane Association) guidelines for the care and handling of the animals. Most people are surprised to learn that if an animal is injured or killed while AHA guidelines were being followed, the film will still earn the certification."""
3,Not Bad,"Good sets. Good costumes. Al appears to be reading from cue cards off camera in some scenes, although I think he plays a believable part. I wish Jeremy could speak up a little. No subtitles in English, only French; kinda dumb isn't it?"
2,Relleno / pure filler material,"Lastima. Sacar un CD de puro relleno dos anos despues de haber sacado un disco fantastico. Es bueno para sonar en acensores.------------Too bad. Having produced a great CD a couple of years ago, Cabas has now followed it with a CD chuck full of filler material. Redundant same sounding bland stuff. Makes for great music to be heard on an elevator."
1,a dud,"a mí tampoco me gustó este último disco. los ritmos son demasiado monótonos. el primer disco de cabas es ORO. éste, desafortunadamente, no tiene el mismo swing ni el sentimiento del anterior. parece ser que este disco lo sacó a la maldita sea sin meterle tanto amor como lo hizo con el primer album. éste no lo recomendaría. el primer disco es mil veces mejor."
1,GARBAGE,"ES UNA PORQUERIA ES MIL VECES MEJOR SU ALBUM DEBUT ESTE DEJA EN VERDAD MUCHO PERO MUCHO QUE DESEAR, ADEMAS LE FALTA ESE TOQUE QUE TENIA SU ANTERIOR ALBUM NO ES LO MISMO EN VERDAD QUE A ESTE NO LE FUNCIONO LO DE CAMBIAR DE RITMOS Y DEMAS COSAS."
4,wicked riddims,"this is really top compilation especially for those of us dont live in London(new zealand). Anyone who has heard ADF should like this. Standout tracks include Talvin Singh's stunna - Jaan, alot of nice beats with irresistable asian flavour on this comp, other top tracks are ADF's - Tu Meri and Punjabi MC's - Bheer. Wicked hot asian flavours.cant get enough! open minded music lovers cop it!"
3,Interesting to say the least.,"It is a very interesting book. Clear and to the point it shows the minds effect over the body to one of its higher levels.My description is based on a book called ""Job's body, a handbook for body work"".However more importantly, Mantak takes the effort out of comming up with your own mental picture as taoist sages teach.This is supposed to be secret, but then again, its not anymore.One thing this book will not guarantee you is achieving this high level. If you have several hours a day in which to spend in practice you perhaps may, but as a cave-at, how do you know if you are doing it exactly right?"
3,Iron shirt?,"Alot of information poorly organized but I question if this is Iron shirt which is still used for martial arts. Compare to Wing Lams video tape from San Francisco for instance, which I have found several that do similar such as White Eyebrow and South Mantis style. In my opinion Mantak emphasizes too much on rooting, of course base is important but in a fight do you stand still, I hope not or a large mass will mow you down."
3,Love the play! Book quality…meh.,"This play touches so many human emotions and makes us think about vanity, valor, and personal character. The printing, however, was very poor quality and the translation was different than what my friends at book club had. I recommend the reading of it, just know that this copy feels more like a self-published pamphlet not fitting to the classic tale itself."
3,"Excellent Play, Mediocre Translation","Cyrano de Bergerac by Rostand is my favourite play. The French original is a gem in almost every respect. It is wonderfully well written in Alexandrine (a difficult form of verse). Rostand's romantic masterpiece shines not only as a play, but as poetry.This particular translation (unattributed) is pedestrian. It is accurate, but tin-eared. It is not the Brian Hooker translation. I state that because I wound up buying it in the belief that it was the Hooker translation and was consequently much disappointed.For any literary work originally written in another language (this, Don Quixote, All Quiet on the Western Front), it is important to pay attention to who is responsible for the translation. Some translators are awful. Some are mediocre (such as whoever did this one). And some are wonderful (Brian Hooker).For those who are not as enamored of Brian Hooker's work as I am, the Anthony Burgess translation is also quite good.Caveat Emptor."
3,a true love story,"In my opinion, Cyrano De Bergerac would have been much better as a novel, rather than a play. However, the story line was smart and clever but got to be a bit confusing throughout some parts due to the play form. I do reccomend this book to somebody interested in plays, and love stories. Cyrano De Bergerac shows you 3 main characters who are truly in love."
5,tres tres bein,"Cyrano De Bergerac is a moving tale about looking past appearances. its thought provoking and enlightening, and it reveals the profoundness that rests wihtin the human soul. it is about facing your fears and going after your dreams only to understand that true beauty is in the soul.it shows that things are not always what they appear and that people fall in love with your spirit not your face. its meaning is pure and true. it reveals the wonder of the mind and the beauty of the heart! it makes one realize that the heart wants what it knows and the mind knows what it wants!! the author uses irony in a clever and cruel way, showing that tragedy is the key to unlocking doors you previously didnt know existed."
2,Cyrano,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. This book has to many details that distract from the main plot. Such as all the mindless chatter in the beginning of the book. It is instances like this one, and many other frivolous conversations that make this book boring."
1,Not what I expected at all!!!!! I was mislead!,I regret getting these pens - the ink from the cartridges take LONG to get to the NIBS which is why I would say I regret getting these pens.. I mean the seller for me was the fact that there were so many size nibs and the cartridges given were of different colours..but other than that i was fooled - yet by another product on AMAZON.. & I am a regular AMAZON shopper - this is the third so far - of products I got on this site that was not up to MARK...
4,Best of =2,Great. The only dissapointment is that FRESH MODE and ROCK ON TOP are not included. Hard to believe these cats have been in the game since 93! Dope and positive as always.
3,just wanted to know,"how am i supposed to know whether to buy this or not when i have no idea what songs are on it. This goes to any UD fans that have this album. Please tell what songs are on this album. I already have fresh mode, journey to anywhere, and bang for the buck and i just want to know if this album has any songs on it that don't appear on these unbelievable albums!! thanx:)"
4,Pretty Good book,"I liked this story for the most part, though it is not one of my favorite Lynne Graham books. I felt bad for Eden because she had to suffer through Damiano's family and all the gossip they spread about her. And of course he didn't believe her when she told him the truth, which is pretty typical of a Lynne Graham book I think. But in the end everything worked out okay. But in general, I liked the two main characters and I thought it was a pretty good book."
1,frustrating!,"Why can't Graham come up with a female character that isn't naive, spineless, and lacking in common sense? Or at least having enough gumption to defend herself against unjust accusations and unfair treatment? The worst thing about Eden's character was a weakness in moral fiber: she withheld information about her husband's sister-in-law's adulterous behavior because she was the only from that branch of the family who seemed kind to her. ...and that goes to show her relationship with her husband that she couldn't even trust him with her feelings. The distant Italian husband, naive English/Scottish girl bit is old."
1,Regretful,"Since I live on Cape Cod, I picked up this book. What a mistake. I knew what was going to happen three pages before it happened. Also, there seems to be a continuity problem. None of the locations in this book corresponded to the real Cape Cod. Why fictionalize Cape Cod? Also, I don't think Delta Airlines ever owned a 747 (the one they took to California). I could go on. I wish this author better luck on her next book."
4,It's alright,"It has great images that really explain the text. It is an easy read, the author gives a good tone. It doesn't have much information on actual advertising research strategy, the back up support to the ad. I think that needs to be elaborated for students to understand it better."
5,Pearl,"I truly enjoyed this book. The way the author writes, keeps wanting to more. Very good series book. Anyone who reads this book will be in for a special voyage"
4,Perl Review,"I loved how the Lord's will is done, no matter how much a person may run. Where as Pearl was escaping the emprisonment of an arranged marraige, she was running right into the Lord's plan. It is cool that He takes the ugly or unwanted in lives and makes it something beatiful. The town of Little Missouri benefited. Pearl was found to be needed and love blossomed in more than one heart. I enjoyed the creative way that the author dealt with the Dove House. It reminds readers that God will only put up with so much ill will and does take care of His children."
3,Waiting to read Pearl,"I have not read Pearl yet, but have read Opal. This was a very interesting book and I could not put it down. If you have not read Opal then you need to,if you have read the rest of the series. I cannot wait to get the other books and wish I could find more on Lauraine's books. They are very inspiring."
3,Not A Bad Effort At All.............,"Similar to the ABBA tribute album, Jive Bunny and the Master Mixers have assembled a group of sound-a-likes to produce an introduction to some of the Beatles' best known tracks.Because it's a non-stop medley album, some Beatles' fans will be angered to hear their favourite band receive the Jive Bunny treatment. Despite that, I recommend this album for those who haven't heard the Beatles before (is there anyone??) as a taster of what they can expect.""Jive Bunny Plays The Music Of The Beatles"" won't win any awards for success, still, it's not a bad album either. Coincidentally, this album -- along with the ABBA tribute -- is the first two releases in a forthcoming 'tribute' series.Jon."
1,Jive Bunny CD,This is a disappointing CD. I have one of the earlier albums by Jive Bunny and it is great. But I would not recommend this one.
5,Outstanding book,"It's rare to find new literature about Chicanos in Los Angeles. Most I've found is set in the years from 1920 to 1970. This was a breath of fresh air.I must admit that I hadn't heard of Luis J. Rodriguez before I read the books. What first attracted me to the book was the pretty girl on the cover. While the stories were compelling to me as a Chicano, I think the true beauty of the author's work is a truth that transcends racial and socio-economic background and most importantly, age.Highly recommended."
1,Wrong Length on Bolt,"You Sent me the wrong bolt length for this particular link kit. I ended up getting the right one at Advance Auto Parts. I'd like to send this one back to you, but I've misplaced the paper work for It. ThanxGary Schaad"
5,THE MOST INERESTING UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS,"All I have to say is that many years ago their was a man named Thomas...""A doubting Thomas"" and he doubted the most important event in history ! Although the information on this video is not as important as the evidence and Truth that Thomas finally came to except when shown in front of his own eyes ,this RODS video may give some of us the mind set that Thomas once had until we see the evidence and truth for ourselves right in front of our own eyes. This is a very interesting video ! and these things called RODS may be real. I will be watching the skies much closer now after watching this video."
1,Peppy Feet Lambswool Insoles (2-Pack),"Peppy Feet Lambswool Insoles (2-Pack)These Peppy Feet Lambs wool inserts are too narrow, too thin and too low quality. They are not like the nice old version of the Dr. Scholl's inserts.I do not suggest these until they resolve these problems."
2,Not for extended wear,"I bought these to put in my work boots, mistake, you'll just pound them to the ground. They do not let your feet really breathe and hold sweat. Now for a walk around the house and or walking the dog in your sneakers, sure that's what these are for. You get a pair for the price, so if you just wanted some extra play around comfort these are for you."
1,2 pack - really?,"I choose these insoles over the many others offered because they claimed ""2 pack"". Imagine my surprise when I saw ""2-pack"" meant 1 left and 1 right insole. come on - seriously?"
5,Kundalini Yoga,"This book is about exercises to increase your awareness and perception. Nothing that I was expecting and a lot more. I found it to be very enlightening and inspiring. One word of caution though, this is not a quick read book if you intend on doing the exercises."
4,Ecstasy of Enigma,"Fowles succeeds at underlining the joys of mystery. His writing is that of a pro. Good links to Yeats. Brilliance of book is in Barry Brukoff's photography. Grainy b&w portraits, not photos. He SAW the place full many an hour."
2,More of a story than a nonfiction work,"I found that the book sheds little light on the mystery of Stonehenge. Because Fowles is a renowned novelist, I found that the book was more like a story than a source of information. For a nonfiction work, it lacked concrete support. Also, it says little about the actual Stonehenge. It says more about the other events of the time. The only reason it was added to other scholarly works about its subject was because it came from an author that lived near it and experienced the majestic power of Stonehenge during the time when it was most popular."
3,"Nice product, well made","Very cute book with activities for toddlers, but similar ones can be had for less money."
1,WARNING! WARNING!! WARNING!!!,This movie package is Blu-ray in disc capacity ONLY! I bought it hoping for a blu-ray copy of McLintock. But I would rate the video quality of this package at below VHS long play quality. The Duke must be spinning in his grave at the misrepresentation of this product. DO NOT expect quality viewing in this package!
1,Do Not Buy,Incredibly poor video quality...don't be fooled by the fact that this is distributed on bluray. The quality looks like someone basically captured VHS tape as it was playing in some cases.
1,RIP OFF,"Do NOT buy this horrible transfers of horrible prints looks worse then video tape, they should be put out of business for selling this crap."
1,Tricked,"Trying to complete my ""Wayne"" collection, I saw some titles I hadn't seen before. They turned out to be colorized versions of""Dawn Rider"", ""Paradise Valley"" and ""Winds of the Wastelands"". The color is washed and not very good. To be fair, the original B&W versions are also included. Run away!"
3,"really no better than dvd quality, but it's John Wayne","I found this on the clearence rack for a nice price and was kinda disapointed in the disc quality, mostly becouse it contains a 1.33 tranfer of McLintock!, a 2.35 film (most likely an old TV print), also present is a short documentary comprised of Duke trailers, a condensed movie length serial, and four Lone Star cheapies. the PQ no better than DVD quality IMO.Still being a fan of John Wayne, I do enjoy the disc overall.If you really want a great blu-ray of a Duke film, get The Searchers."
3,Saturday Afternoon Cowboys ride on.,"I purchased this set for one reason. I enjoy the occasional Saturday afternoon early Western, and I wanted my children to share that with me. John Wayne did this with the best of them. You remember that kind of movie, where the plots were simple, the bullets endless and hats never fell off (even in fights)?Sure the film is grainy and the sound scratchy; all the easier to recapture the feel of the old Bijou Theater(s) sprinkled across the MidWest.These movies provide an hour's respite from today's tragic world, offering instead guys in white saving the ranch in the nick of time from guys in black. Butter some popcorn, pop a Pepsi, sit back and enjoy becoming simple for an hour. The world's problems can wait."
2,Terror of the Barbarians,Not one of Steve Reeves best. The copy was just okay at best. The acting was some of the worst I have seen in one of these types of movies. The dubbing was very poor. Reeves was the only real redeming part of this movie. With poor production values and some real bad action parts it was not good for watching.
4,Terror of the Barbarians,I really enjoyed this movie. The picture quality was pretty good and Steve Reeves wasgreat! I highly recommend this movie to anyone that is a Steve Reeves Fan.
2,Not Aetrex shoes !,"Due to the super fast delivery, I rated excellent but be aware, the shoes are not Aetrex as the ad shows. They appear to be identical but when you take a close look, the brand is Apex, which I have no idea where is coming from. I've been wearing these shoes since my Podiatric prescribed them to me 4 years ago, and I hope they result with the same quality and benefit to my back injury than the real Aetrex, if not, it is a total ripped off."
3,Could be better,"Pieces in this set reminds me very much of Mozarts piano sonatas. I don't like this, but can't blame people who does :)If you want something that is closer to organs ""native"" sound and texture you could be interested on Hans Fagius' recording on BIS, which outrates this recording most prominently in selection of pieces. Interestingly both CDs are labelled as they were complete recording of the composers organ music. Purists may check the ""true"" list from the Köchel-catalogue.Recording is as good as all the recent Naxos releases - they have done remarkable improvement in this aspect, especially organ music is invariably beautifully recorded."
2,Of historical value for Aniceto fans,"This CD has Aniceto himself introducing his 30 greatest hits. While the song selection is outstanding, the CD only has minute long snippets of typically 3 minute songs, ruining an otherwise excellent concept. I gave the second star for Aniceto's interesting reminiscences of the who, what, where, and when of the song, countries where the song was most popular, and other historical tidbits. For the Aniceto musical historian only."
5,Eclipse is so Beautiful!,"I got the maxi-single for Christmas and I decided to get this version, since it had ""Eclipse"". Gosh, Eclipse was so beautiful! It was pretty short, but it was still very haunting."
5,"energetic, resonant, convincing","As mentioned by another reviewer here, the Eder quartet recorded most of this series in a highly resonant, cathedral-like interior so as to give the quartet the power of a small string orchestra. But what is particularly effective for me is the separation and balance between instruments; each instrument can be followed individually if so desired, and with Mozart each has interesting work to do. I don't know how this separation is accomplished in engineering terms but the effect is rich and sumptuous. I bought one CD of this series and quickly bought others. The group achieves brilliant, extroverted interpretations, full of brio and rhythmic drive in the allegros and prestos and charm and poise in the andantes. Recorded in the early 90s but a steal at these prices. Highly recommended."
4,Life in the wilderness,"The rough manuscript for this book was found with Garcia's things when he died in 1942. Even after editing, it was still pretty rough, but I think it was worth the trouble to read it - Garcia tells some interesting stories about Native Americans (who he refers to as Injuns) from 1877-1879. Some of the book is comprised of first-person stories from his own experience; other parts are his Nez Perce wife's stories."
5,Tough Trip Through Paradise 1878-1879,"A truly outstanding insight into the lives of the people of the 1870's, and the interaction between the incoming settlers and the native Americans.It is a written account of a young man and his experiences with the trappers, Indians, thieves, and the good an bad people of a free roaming society.An account of close calls with humans, animals and the unknown. A true perspective of friendships, love and death, in a wild country.All recorded on paper and stored an found in an old wooden dynamite box."
3,Interesting book,Three in my family have read this book and it is somewhat hard to read but interesting especially if you are from Montana
3,Cute but can't release the wire,"I got this as a gift for my baby, who is not yet born. I have been trying to get the wire part that attaches it tot he box out of it, but I cannot release it. I have tried scissors and plyers, and no luck. I cannot give this to a toddler with wires hanging out. They are sharp even if I trim them as short as I can get them. Not sure what I will do yet.The wires did come off one side, but not the other. It's kind of like the turtle has two wires sticking out of his plasterone. I may not have spelled that right. It is the bottom section of a turtle's shell.Hope this was helpful.Q"
5,Essential for any film music devotee,"Finally bought a copy of Jon Burlingame's excellent reference work SOUND AND VISION, 60 years of Motion Picture soundtracks. This is a must have. I have been collecting film music since the early sixties and to have all this information between two covers is marvelous. The detail, the wealth of information and more importantly, the accuracy is astonishing. (I missed some real gems in my buying history!) This book is certainly authoritative, and at 244 pages crammed full of detail, it is a bargain. Highly recommended.... John"
4,older than i thought,"I wish a bit more info had been given on the site, but it was in pretty good condition considering it was 10 years old"
1,Dont waste your money or time!! Terrible !!!!!!!,"Hello I chose this baby bouncer, because I loved the way it looked. That was a huge mistake. I received the first one and the music did not work. Then I received a second one and the music did not work. Also it was very hard to put together, tiny little annoying screws etc.Nice to look at, but it scared my husband and I, it looks like the baby will just tumble right out of it.No good for newborns!!! Not sure if it is really good for any age baby. Mobile does not always work. Don't waste your money. There are many good bouncer seats out there, but this is not one of them. This is my fifth child, and this product was a big disappointment."
1,Didn't work,There was one review on this item when i purchased it and the person said they didn't like it because the vibration didn't work but i figured i would take my chances because it was only one person who said that. We got the item and the mobile turned twice then it stopped working and the music didn't play. I told my husband about the other review and we agreed that the reason this item was so cheap (regular price $59.95 on sale for $34.95) was that they were having problems across the board with this model. We sent it back for a refund and ended up going with a Fischer Price model thinking that this was a company that had a reputation we could trust.
1,HATE IT,"Totally hate this bouncer. Loved Summer's customer service...but here I sit with 3 identical bouncers...2 that don't work properly and one brand new in the box that I don't want. The vibration doesn't work all the time on one of them and neither does the mobile. The music, nature sounds and heartbeat work, but they're lame. Don't really sound realistic...sounds cheesy. The other one the mobile doesn't work and neither does the music or other sounds...but the vibration works, but so much so you can feel it across the room as well as hear it on my wood floors. I don't recommend this product at all...but as I said, great customer service. I've only paid for one bouncer, but have 3....not even sure if the one brand new in the box works...will be returning that one so they can sell it to someone else, or replace someone elses non-working bouncer. Ugh...going get a good ole reliable Fisher Price one for the same price!"
2,Stay away,"Our big issue is that there are an array of confusing, unmarked buttons and the big downer is a remote that you can't open to get a battery into because the screw is from an eyeglass screw recessed so deeply you can't get a tool in to unscrew it. Assembly takes more time than Fischer Price and more parts/screws also. The seat is flatter -- FP is better/bowl shaped so the infant will stay in."
4,Sonya Jason's quite good on sax!,"This cd is great for putting a person in a relaxed state of mind. It's not smooth jazz, but it's music you can eat to and enjoy: hance, the name Supper Club. My favorite is Green Dolphin Street and Harlem Nocturne. All the other tracks are quite enjoyable, too. Sonya Jason can weild her axe!"
4,BANZAIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!,"My 6 and 9 YO have not stopped playing on this for 3 days straight! That being said...Seams would seem to be the weak point in this product, although we have had no problems so far. I do not tie the air drains very tight so to allow air to escape easier when kids jump. Manufacturer should make the landing area longer and slope the end bumper as opposed to the current design, I took my eyes off kids for a second and daughter went down head first on her back and hurt her neck. I reccomend allowing only one child up at a time as a miss step could send child to the ground from 7' in the air as there is nothing to prevent a fall.I'm not an overly cautious parent so I highly reccomend this product. The more timid may want to avoid it."
1,Why did they even bother,"This is a very poorly produced show that is further flawed by obvious and very serious errors in the kata. As far as the author being the ""World Karate Organization"" Kata Champion, an extensive search has failed to locate a single reference to this organization, let alone a list of its kata champions.The content of this program bears only a passing resemblance to Traditional Goju Ryu-keep your money in your pocket!"
1,Not Japanese Goju either,"I am a practitioner of Japanese Goju. A direct decent of Grand Master Gogen Yamaguchi. There are many mistakes on Mr. Warrener's katas. In fact, put aside the kata differences, in Japanese Goju, we are very strict on the perfection of Kihon (basics). I am as a 6th Dan in Japanese Goju, would put the techniques shown at a green belt level. It is these kind of demonstrations of poor techniques that put a bad name in Goju. Breaking 10 bricks does not make you a master. An elephant can do that."
1,Pathetic,"It's difficult to express in words just how bad this prpgram is. In fact, there is not a good thing that anyone could say about it."
3,Japanese - not Okinawan,"Just a quick note. I haven't ordered this (yet), but the difference in Kata might be variation in style. Warrener practices Yamaguchi's Japanese Goju, not the more wide-spread Okinawa style.Scott"
5,Your Seven Energy Centers,"... - I bought it ... last year and I use it all the time as a superb reference book. It has more than enough information to enable everyone from complete beginners to more knowledgeable folk to understand and learn about how our chakras work and what they do and mean. It is well laid out with graphics and clear explanations. Please, if you get chance, find this book and keep it by your bedside - it is wonderful for healers (I am a Reiki master) and spiritualists alike."
3,"Great, if you are new ageish","I thought this would be something more analytical with real information. It was a little new ageish for my taste, but I have friends who swear by it. I guess it depends on how deeply you believe this stuff. It wouldn't be a good overview of the energy centers, but rather a more in-depth view, with more spiritual explanations."
3,half great,"Erasure made 3 CD singles when they could have compiled them on just one. Clearly they were trying to squeeze their fans for cash, but I shamelessly followed suit. I like the mellow second version here and the instrumental b-side ""Dodo."" When there's 2 good songs on a 4-songed disc, I don't really complain."
4,Goggly Man,"Another terrifically written story by Anne Fine.She really is my favourite writer.This novel is about Kitty Killin(no,she doesn't like a spot of cat murdering)who is giving her mother's brand new boyfriend a terrible time.Sometimes I did not like him as he would butt in on Mrs. Killin's parenting skills,ooh!Who did he think he was!?I recommen all books by Ms.Fine."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought the digital version of this book in hopes of having a guide to take with us on our holiday. I wanted to take some fantastic water shots while I was gone. This book fails on so many levels:1 The pictures should be in colour to truly illustrate techniques2 The photographer should demonstrate the techniques used more clearly - very poorly done3 This book is archaic in technique4 It is designed for the very basic and beginner photographerThere are many book out there better than this one. Don't waste your money - I wish I hadn't.
3,Not too impressive,"Not a lot of new info and worst of all, the photos chosen to illustrate the points are not at all impressive."
2,not HD as expected,When I purchased this product I expected it to be HD quality but that wasn't the case; they rent it in HD but if you purchase it they do not provide the HD. I previously purchased Scooby Doo in HD and that was provided in HD so my expectation was not met and I would be hesitant to purchase epic titles such as Toy Story due to Amazon possibly not providing HD quality.
3,bootleg,Bought this for my wife it looks like it was a bootleg copy from hong kong. I didn't know hong kong bootlegged blu-ray.
1,"I'm not an overly reactive grandma, BUT","I'm a pretty average, complacent, kinda grandma. I don't ""get it"" with lots of parents' complaints about toys and movies.But I was watching this movie (rental) and I told my husband during the incinerator scene that I thought it would be very scary for little kids. The movie is kinda depressing: bullying, abandonment, good guy turns bad, etc. Overall just not a great kid movie like TS and TS2. Def recommend you preview this one B4 gifting it to a grandkid."
1,Not appropriate for my 3 year old,"I just bought this movie this past weekend based on all the positive comments I had always heard about it. I can honestly say I truly enjoyed the very beginning (up to the time the toys made it to the daycare) but that rapidly changed. Just like some of the other comments, I felt this movie was depressing and creepy (even for an adult). My 3 year old got very scared of the monkey and told me he did not want to see the movie again. It was a huge disappointment since I was a big fan of the first two. I do not understand why they would make movies like these for children!"
3,blue ray freeze and loops alot,"I'm going to try this disc on my playstation and see if it repeats the problem.I'll update the star rating soon.Update March 2011,Samsung has a firmware patch that takes care of the freeze/loop issue! Yippie!"
1,"Nope, Not for Young Kids!","Our 4 year old loved TS1, TS2, Cars and other Pixar movies. This one not at all! He did not smile or laugh once during the entire movie, just said it was too long.I don't get the mindset at Disney and Pixar with this one. Like others, I found TS3 very dark and depressing, and I certainly do appreciate the sentimentality around Andy growing up. Oh, and why does Disney need to try to numb our minds with 6+ trailers!We wasted our time and money on this one, don't waste yours!"
5,Not all 3rd sequels are terrible,"I was kinda iffy when I heard about Toy Story 3. But Pixar has never really let me down. Upon viewing the movie, I knew I was right. The movie's brilliant."
5,Best Toy Story,This movie is so many things to so many people - in the theatre I watched it with kids as young as four and others my age (over 50)...we all loved it and for many different reasons. The emotions this movie brings up - I laughed and cried - several times.I LOVE this movie. No one does it better than Disney and Pixar...add in Tom Hanks and Tim Allen - over the moon!!! You've got a friend in me...
5,"Great movie, tearful wrap up to a great storyline",The toys from the Toy Story series are great. They draw you right in and I still love seeing them whenever I'm in Disney World. If you haven't seen this yet let me warn you that it is a tear jerker. Both my wife and I found ourselves crying at different parts but we both definitely cried at the end. I won't spoil anything but you will enjoy this movie :-)
3,Not your Toy Story from 11 years ago,"Let me start off my family and I love Pixar/Disney movies, have all of them on blu-ray. We bought the blu-ray/dvd/digital copy set of all three for our daughter(2 year old) for Christmas. We all sat down to watch it and half-way through our daughter stopped watching and asked to watch another movie. I had to agree with her, I found it to be boring and trying to be to ""deep."" The characters and storyline didn't feel anything like the first two movies. It had it's funny parts but overall felt it was much more geared to the audience from 11 years ago who have grown up. Biggest family movie let-down for us in 2010. Hoping next Pixar movies isn't as ""deep"" and dark."
3,The kids got tired after the first 30 minutes,Kids get antsy and move to something else when movies become more about the words and less about the animation.
2,Love the movie...,"but I hated the fact that I had to fix it in order to watch the whole movieit played the 1st half fine, however, the other half it just stopped and said the disc wasn't thereI cleaned the DVD player and it did the same thing, so I got it fixed since I didn't want to return itIt didn't cost much but still, I love the movie and happy I have it but the fact that I had to walk 2miles just to get it fixed is just crazy...I didn't return it cuz I didn't want to walk an extra 3miles to the Post Office"
5,LOVED IT!,I loved it! Great great movie. I laughed. I cried. My kids loved it. My boys each have a favorite.
4,A winning animation,Not crazy about animation but this one touches the heart...I enjoyed itThe title award winning song was the reason I bought it...it's goodA lovely warm-hearted film with lots of lessons for all of us
5,DVD in great shape,"We just ordered Toy Story 3 on DVD, and as promised, was in great condition! Cover was intact with no worn edges, DVD had no scratches on it. The extras are a little minimal, but the behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie was interesting, especially for art and graphic design lovers."
4,Fun movie,Although I did not care for the scene where they toys were about to go into the incinerator for the most part it was a good movie. Fun and great animation.
3,Predictable end of trilogy,"I watched this third entry in Pixar's highly successful Toy Story franchise with reservations as to how it would conclude. I was not too surprised with the predictable characters in this final version specifically the villain; a beat up and sour teddy bear and a total characterature even with a southern accent. For the most part, I watched all of the series to observe the animation and it remains flawless, but after awhile it can even get boring. I'm glad they rapped up what happened to Woody and the gang for the children who followed all the adventures and bought all the merchandise."
5,All-time favorite,"I needed the Blu-ray disks only, but I bought this 5-disc combo for the best price. I found the digital copy unexpectedly useful; I could download it to my iTune and watch it on my iPhone. The process was very simple.There are so many fun extras on the second Blu-ray disk and I am happy with the purchase."
5,i like this movie,"who know Barbie was so politically and philosophically astute? this is a fun movie. there is very little diversity, however and that still seems weird."
3,awesome except for digital copy not working,the didital copy can not be used :( but the regular dvd works great :) my son has watched it over and over
5,Toy Story 3 Review,"I purchased Toy Story Story 3 from Buy Direct 4 Less. I received the CD in a timely manner but had a problem getting it to work properly. I emailed Buy Direct 4 Less and told them I had a defective CD. Buy Direct 4 Less quickly responded to my email, apoligized for me having the problem and very promply sent me a replacement CD...at not cost to me. Great job Buy Direct 4 Less...excellent customer service!"
4,Liked it,"I liked Toy Story 3, even though i disliked the 1st and 2nd. it was about where the toys are sent to a day care and eventually try to escape. besides the fact that the toys are almost killed and the creators possibly trying to show a bad message, it was a clean film."
3,Not like 1 and 2,"It's not that the movie isn't good, it's just that I bought it for my (just under) 2 yr old who LOOOOVES toy story 1 and 2. However, the 3rd one is way too dark, evil and scary for such a young kid. I guess they wanted to make this one ""older"" or something, but not sure why it had to be so evil. We stopped it and wouldn't let him watch it anymore. Will save it for when he's older. Just be advised for the wee little ones!"
5,Bought before released,"It was a great service to have this bought and arrive on my doorstep the day it was released! I didn't have to worry about trying to find it in the store. Also, I got it for a great price!"
3,Disco 3D no tiene subtitulos en español,"La calidad gráfica es impresionante, pero el disco 3D no tiene ni audio ni subtitulos en español como describe amazon y la misma caja del bluray"
5,The Best Most Exiting Toy Story of them all!!!!,Toy Story 3 is Wonderful Fun and Laughs for the entire Family! its the kind of movie you can never get tired of. as is the usually case most sequels are never as good as the originals but its just the opposite with Toy Story 3 the story is very Funny with a Lot of Heart. and Wonderful Lessons in friendship and how Woody Buzz Jessie and the rest of the gang stick together no matter what they have to face. the Movie is perfect for kids and will enthrall them to the End. Another reason I think its the best One is because Pixar combines Hilarious Humor. Heartwarming scenes and Dazzling New Toys! like a Strawberry scented bear named Lotso and more really cool New Toys its also the most Exiting one because of all the comic action.the film really is a must See For all Fans who want a third amazing adventure starring their favorite Toys! Buy!
5,Excellent!,"Wonderful movie, it came in an excellent condition! My son was very excited when he first saw it! I am very satisfied with my purchase and prompt service from Amazon!"
4,Toy Story 3,"I love the Toy Story movies...just got a Blu-Ray player, and ordered this wonderful movie. It looks great on my large hdtv. I received it promptly and I credit Amazon with their good customer service. Watched the movie almost immediately, and do not regret my purchase."
5,Great Movie!,We ordered this movie for our grand children! It is so delightful! Toy Story is the absolute favorite of our 2 year old grand son! The kids enjoy these movies at home and in the car! We pre-ordered so it ships to them on the day it releases in the stores! It arrives a couple of days after the release!
5,Quality stuff,"Toy story 3 is a fine finish to the franchise a movie that tugs at every possible heartstring that exists, and adds just enough drama to make it unforgettable.Andy is going off to college and it becomes D-Day for the toys, who will end up in the attic, who will be donated, who will be trashed and what lucky few will come with him?There are several excellent scenes, and a few adult gags involving fashion. The initial pre-school & ""Latin lover"" scenes are priceless.My only complaint is this. It was established in Toy Story 2 that Buzz is a very valuable toy. I think that should have been a factor in what was going on.On and the featurette Night and Day was absolutely fabulous. It was in the best traditions of the cartoons of the 40's and 50's. More of those please."
3,Not as much fun,"As much as I enjoyed the first two Toy Story movies. I just couldn't get into this one. I have heard of people crying during this movie. But for me it did present closure to this story. Good Bye Woody, Good Bye Buzz, thanks for the good memories"
3,Dark,"This Toy Story is not like the other two movies. It is dark and not really for children. It does not have the happy endings that the other two have. Not sure why they made this movie they way they did. Think they should have really thought about the movie before releasing it. We are pretty understanding of movies and do not freak out about most movies, but this one we will not buy."
2,It has nearly two months. Still product is not delivered.,It has nearly two months since I ordered the BD discs. Still the discs are not delivered. Is there a way to track international order ?
2,Poor,"I can only imagine that the folks who gave this 5 stars did so in the thrall of the closing moments which are the only ones with any emotion and the only ones worth watching. The rest of it is dull and, like many movies, it represents a missed opportunity and a waste of resources. I don't know why anyone would have strong feelings about it.The first one was excellent; the second was ok; this one is mostly a waste of time."
4,still waiting,"I preordered this dvd August 24th, I'm still waiting on November 7, I can walk into the store and buy this now. Why are they taking so long to ship this item? sometimes amazon sucks."
1,Triggery and Bleak,"Toy Story 3 was a traumatic experience for me. The villain is too real, and triggered flashbacks of abuse. Maybe I'm spoiled by the considerate nature of the internet's fiction community, but if TS3 had been a fic, the mods would have come down hard about abuse warnings and trigger warnings for the villain and the whole chunk of the movie that takes place in the daycare centre.Aside from that, I did not like the message that everyone gives up their toys in order to fully grow up. I feel it's a bleak message for children to be told that they must leave everything behind, or inevitably will. Personally I know many people who have held onto and still make companions of their toys, and still use their imaginations. It just seemed forced, to me, that Andy gave up his toys. There was no real reason for him to do so, so the fact that he did felt out of character, especially after all the build-up of him looking for them."
1,the CD is not working properly!!!!,"I bought this movie for my young clients in my clinic. however, it is not played till last ending. in the middle of the movie it is stuck and stop it.first time I was think the video player would be wrong. therefore I tryed to play several time here and there. therefore, I found it was the CD problem.I wasted money!!!!Don't buy from Amazon."
1,This movie is dark,"I liked one and two..but this one sucked...it scared my nephew..even though he loved one and two,I did not let him watch this one."
1,Disappointed,My family and I were very disappointed that the very first time we went to view this movie an entire chapter had to be skipped b/c there is something wrong with the DVD. There are no visible scratches but none the less we are unable to watch the entire movie:(
5,Toy Story 3,"We bought this to add to our collection of toy story movies. It's one of my favorites of all time and the sequels, especially this one, are as good or better than the first. What a great story."
4,Toy Story 3,"This was much different than I expected. We had our grandkids with us and they were really frightened. All in All, I enjoyed it, but probably would not suggest it to young children."
4,Excellent!!!,"This product came fast, scratch free, and works as good as new. Best of all, its half the retail price."
2,Toy Story 3 Blu ray 3D,"According to website of this product, a Blu Ray disc should be 3D with Spanish subtitles or dubbed into Spanish. I received 2 promotions amazon this film (with 5 disks each), but nowhere came the 3D movie dubbed or subtitled in Spanish. It was false advertising."
4,"It was good, not better than TS 2 or TS though...","I felt this was a good movie, it was a bitter darker than the other two movies but it was still good. I still feel that TS 2 was the best of the bunch, and I don't think Pixar can top it."
3,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.Not counting shallow effects, there are about 16 out of screen effects that extend 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer, 1 effect at 15% and a few blurry rain drops at 20%.The quality of the in screen 3D is good to very good but...PIXAR DOES NOT WANT (or try to create) OOS EFFECTS.Children may enjoy Pixar's in-screen 3D films, but if Pixar wants to ignore half of the 3D technology, they should only charge half as much.*** Disappointing OOS 3D ***MY 3D RATING = GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
5,played me,"Well done, complete movie for young and old(who you callin old). I'm not the biggest fan of computer animation, but this one is excellent, it moved me."
5,LOL,This movie will make you laugh. I just love watching this movie.Woody is the best and laughing is a must for this movie
5,Surprisingly amazing!,I had high hopes for Toy story 3.. I knew it was going to be good but I had no idea it was going to be great. This sequel was the perfect way to end the series.... Toy story 3 is a remarkable film and i definitely recommend this movie to any fan of the first 2..this movie captures your attention immediately its very well done
5,Grandsons loved it,I think this was about the favorite thing under the tree. I know it's lasting longer than some things did.
5,review,I had heard that some people thought this movie was not as good as the others. Not so in my opinion. I loved it. What happens to our toys when we go off to college. It would be nice to believe that this is what happens to them. Find another home where someone will love them as much as you did.
3,The 2nd is still my favorite,"This was not what I was expecting. And what's with the creepy baby?! Didn't they cover that already in the first one? This movie was a little dark for my taste, tho it certainly did have it's sweet and funny moments. But I will say this, the part where they were close to becoming actual trash towards the end was very eye opening. I hope kids who see that will have a better understanding of how that process works and realize just how much waste we produce, including the toxins it contributes to the earth. Similar to ""Wall-E"" in that sense.Pixar still holds rank when it comes to animation! THE Best"
3,Toy Story3 DVD,Movie itself is great. DVD stops in middle and has to be restarted and fast forwarded to where it stopped. Something in DVD is bad.
2,Very small for price,"I was very disappointed with the size of these figures for the price. They are probably only 8-9 inches tall and I thought that they would be more like 12"" tall based on the description but the 12"" must refer to the packaging. I saw similarly sized figures at Target that included Buzz, Woody, and about 3 other characters that was only $53 so that would have been a much better deal."
2,cheap!,"Length:: 0:35 MinsCheap for the price it cost!""Slim Buzz"" In front it looks good, but is thin and not a good quality toy.The box who contain the discs is not good at all, the push center of it to put the discs out is hard and can dammage the discs.Not recommand it."
3,Had problems playing,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew...not sure why this has been the only movie that has not played in their blu ray player...I exchanged it for another and had the same issue. All other blu rays play fine except this one...it might just have something to do with the player itself (Samsung)
5,Wow,Well worth the money.I love Toy Story and the 3D is good not amazing but everything else makes this worth the buy if you don't like 3D just purchase the regular for $30.
5,Toy Story 3,I was very pleased with product .I ordered on a Monday received it by Friday was so pleased we in fact ordered another movie today and I see it is already on the way .
5,Pixar has done it again!,"Toy Story 3 has Andy's toys trying to find a new place where they belong after Andy gets ready to go away to college. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), however hasn't given up on Andy and plans on going away with him. But Woody's toy friends need his help because their stay at a daycare center isn't the paradise they thought it would be. Can Woody help them escape and make it home in time to go with Andy ?The movie is a very satisfying end, for the movies that is, there's going to be a short before Cars 2 I heard. So we'll still get to see the characters that we love. But Toy Story 3 still feels like farewell and it has a very emotional ending that's bound to make you cry happy tears. Pixar has done it again because so far Toy Story 3 is the best movie that I've seen this year. Just see it, but bring tissues!"
5,An excellent end to the series,"...if they leave it there, anyway. Funny and meaningful, just as good as the best Pixar films. This film hit just the right mix of nostalgia and closure."
5,Great Movie,This was a great movie! We love it and good thing too because our son makes us watch it over and over.
3,"This review it's about the product, specifically the DVD, not the movie","First of all I'll like to apologize for my English since it's not my native language.The movie is great, I love it, I think Pixar is great in making heart-touching movies with good family values, but this review isn't about the movie, is about the DVD disc. I'm from Guatemala (Central America) my native language is Spanish, when you see the product's description it says, and I quote:Language: EnglishSubtitles: English, French, SpanishSo I was expecting that the DVD will have Spanish subtitles as well, but it doesn't, it only has English for the hearing impaired, my blu-ray player doesn't work and I planned to watch the DVD movie while I fix it but now I can't, Amazon should have a separated product description for every disc."
2,mixed stars for different ages. mpaa blew it rating it G,If I had to leave a theater for attending a G rated film Id be pissed. Total screw up by the mpaa for rating it G. Or was it a deal to get more tickets sold? A G rating is supposed to mean lets go to the movies and not have concern over how your toddler/young kid is going to react. By far this is a PG. That isn't an issue as long as its promoted as what it is. For an adult its a great film. For a toddler its scary. For a kid either or anywhere in between.
3,English only,"Altough it says on the back cover that it contains a french version, dubbed in Quebec, this DVD only contains the english version."
1,had it with Dixar,"paid a premium price for the Blu-ray DVd and it won't even play. I am fed up with the formatting of Disney DVD products which make it difficult to watch what you paid for, without navigating through an annoying array of trailers and ads, and having their product try to download their own software. And when I do try to ferret through the trail of ""support"" they provide with their Blu-ray product, I get a page of ads. Screw them. The Emperor is naked."
4,Not as good as the original for toddlers,Movie arrived quickly and in good condition as most amazon products do. The movie itself has darker and more scary content than the other toy story movies with a particularly intense scene where the toys think they are going to be incinerated. Still has the great mix of kid and adult humor of the other movies and have only watched in blu-ray so far but plan to use digital copy too. Several good special features/shorts
5,Very good!,Toy Story 3 was ver enjoyable. The fun and surprises from the first two were evident in this one also.
5,A remarkable and fitting end,"With this exquisite final chapter, Toy Story can be ranked not just among the best animated features, but among the best film trilogies of all time, with Star Wars, Back to the Future, The Lord of the Rings, The Godfather, etc."
5,its awesome movie best picture quality and sound,its the best bluray picture quality i ever seen.i recomand toy story3 bluray movie.great dts hd master audio sound
5,LOVE!!!!!! this movie,"I just love this movie. I've seen all of them, but Toy Story 3 is my favorite. I have watched this movie over and over again, and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It's a feel good family movie."
5,Greatest animated movie ever,"This movie almost made me cry and I don't cry easily. My 12 year old cried, and neither of us have ever cried while watching an animated movie. This third installment is better than the first two movies. That is almost unheard of as far as trilogies are concerned. Later installments of movies are almost never as good as (and certainly not better than) the first installment."
5,Pixar at its finest,An excellent movie - Pixar at its best. A great movie for kids and adults alike. I am only saddened by the probability that this is the final Toy Story movie.
5,3rd times a charm,"What can be said in praise of this movie that hasn't been said already? I think the Disney/Pixar folks need to be commended for this package: Blu-ray Feature, Blu-ray Bonus Disc, DVD Feature and Digital Copy 7.1 DTS Master Audio all in one set for a decent price. Blu-Ray fans need to vote with their wallets to show the industry that this is the expected, acceptable STANDARD - all Blu-ray releases need to be done this way."
5,superb,"this moveie being the 3rd was the best yet. It was well put together, The only thing I could have done with out was the tears at the ending. This doesn't mean you should have done it differently, it was truely perfect the way it was.It just hit all the moms in the theatre the same way. Especially for me. I have my youngest graduating H.S. this year and then off to college. There were a few of us sniffeling. The movie was truely amazing.Job well done Guys! Keep it up!!!!"
5,Bittersweet!!!!,"Love this movie. So many funny little things to watch for, and such a endearing story. Loved it. Cry everytime at the end."
5,Excellent Purchase,I was looking to buy this Blu-Ray & DVD Combo pack as a gift to my kids and finally I found it here for a very reasonable price. This is a very good movie and we enjoyed it. A very nice way to end the Toy Story trilogy. Thank you Pixar & Disney.
4,review of ts3,"Great movie! But in the description, it says it has three languages - English, French, and Spanish. This is NOT TRUE. There is no Spanish! Very disappointed."
5,Wonderful way to end the series,"Nostalgia, refreshing new characters, and solid animation are among the strengths of the movie.- Back to the old days. Many flashbacks, familiarity, and fond memories are brought back and fused with the new story line.- Plot. Awesome! The daycare provides a good setting for an interesting story.- New characters. The new characters are a welcomed addition and my favorite is Ken. The relationship between Ken and Barbie is hilarious, cute, and entertaining throughout the movie.Themes of family, teamwork, childhood, and growing up are present in this movie. Great for kids and adults alike."
5,Awesome Movie,"Your favorite toys are back in toy story three. toy story three is about what happens when andy goes to collage. I think this movie is great. The original cast is back except Jim Varney(Who Plays Slinky Dog In The first two) R.I.P., and some new cast like the legendary whoopie Goldberg and Michael Keaton who plays Ken. This movie is well made. It is true that it is kind of a sad movie. but i think it needed to be told to conclud the toy story movies. Is this the last? Probably so. well all in all eveybody had a good ride and people will mess these characters. I think alot of people can relate to this movie. Even The villians story was sad, you probably would turn sour if someone left you behind and then you found out that they replaced you. The movie had a great ending even though it was a tearjearker. All in all this movie was awesome and it will be a Disney Classic."
5,The Perfect Ending to the Trilogy!!!,"I grew up with the original Toy Story movies, and now that I'm older, they still hold a special place in my heart. The 11 years was definitely worth the wait. This was an epic, and a great way to end the final story. Andy is going to college, and hasn't played with his toys in years. He plans on taking Woody, but leaving Buzz, Jessie, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, the aliens, & Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head in the attic. When the toys are accidentally thrown in the trash, they decide to go to Sunnyside Daycare. They are greeted by Lots-o-Huggin' Bear, aka Lotso. When Woody escapes the daycare, he is found by Bonnie and taken to her house. When Woody learns of Lotso's past, he decides to go back, and help his friends break out and get back to Andy before he goes away. It becomes very emotional toward the end, that I cried. It all comes down to this. I highly recommend TOY STORY 3!!!"
3,Digital Copy Flaw,"A caution to those of you who plan to put Toy Story 3 on their Iphones/Ipods using Digital Copy: the file was encoded with mono sound! That's right, there is no separation in the audio channels, effectively castrating the incredible sound mix done for this film. Shame on the authoring guy who made the file for this set. It's not like this for ""UP"" for example."
3,Getting a little long in the tooth,"I love the Pixar films. Especially Toy Story 1 & 2 but this franchise is getting stale. While Toy Story 3 was enjoyable, it was also overly predictable and had a few trying moments.I hope that Disney/Pixar decide to let this be the last of this series and leave it be. I think any additional movies would take a way from the others."
3,Toy Story 3,"This is NOT an original DVD, I bought it for a great prices thinking it was an original DVD. When I open it you can definitely see it's a copy, it plays like an original but I wish it would of been more specific as what it was."
1,Not that great or hyped up to be.,"Im a toy story fan I have both the 1st one and 2nd on dvd think there both great. I was expecting alot out of number 3, something that would really wrap things up. Watching the movie, there wasnt that many clever things or interesting things going on that made you say ""oh yeah thats pixar for ya"" instead a bunch of boring characters were introduced, flat story and not so funny lines, in fact alot of the ""funny"" parts were given away during the trailer! I was just surprised pixar couldnt think of any wittier or funnier lines, but then again this is a kids movie and im a adult now."
1,this is in the 3D section and it is not 3D!!!!!!!!,I try and buy 3D movies for my grandkids. I buy this movie because it is listed in the 3D section on Amazon. 4 disc so I thought it must be 3D! Right? WRONG! NO 3D WHY IS IT IN THE 3D SECTION? I HAVE NO IDEA AND NO ONE AT AMAZON SEEMS TO KNOW ALSO. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR 3D DON'T BUY THIS ONE!
5,An Extraordinary Classic,"The Toy Story movies have elevated ""children's movies"" to truly astonishing heights. To say that this is the best of the three might give the impression that the other two were somehow worse than this, so it is perhaps best to take them as a whole and say: These three movies are truly, without a doubt, classic, from beginning to end. They're funny, touching, heartwarming, exciting, imaginative, beautiful, and full of wonder and joy.Pixar is the most consistent studio for quality films, and they deliver once again with Toy Story 3. It will satisfy anyone - young, old, or in between."
5,A no brainer,"What can I say...it's Pixar, excellent story and computer graphics, and Blu Ray. With the extra features in this package, it's well worth the value. Naturally, it now holds a space beside my Ultimate Toy Box set of number 1 and 2 on my video shelf.enjoy!"
4,Good movie,"The movie was different from previous Toy Story movies but it was still very good. I did not like Alonzo the bear. He was very dark but he got what he deserved in the end. Overall, recommend! Barbie and Ken were one of my favorite characters from a comedy aspect."
4,Good kids movie,"Great kids movie with jokes for adults also. Enjoyed the movie, Enjoyed the movie. One more word required. One more word is required. one"
4,Kuni,"This is a very good movie. I laughed and cried and just loved it. I must say though, it is not for young children as it is a bit scary in places mean spirited a bit. I hope they don't make anymore Toy Story movies as I feel this is a wonderful way to end the series."
4,We liked it!!!!,"We just watched Toy Story 3. We loved it! It made us laugh, feel sad and nervous all at the same time. We even bit our nails. Our old friends Buzz and Woody meet some new friends for some new adventures. Buzz speaks espanol(spanish), the toys almost get burnt and the aliens save the day. We recommend this movie for kids over the age of 5 because some parts are scary. Overall, we give this movie 4 stars!"
5,Another awesome pixar film!,"I was very excited to know that they were coming out with another Toy Story. I grew up on Toy Story, so to see them make another one and not ruin it was awesome. Buzz, The Potato family, and man.. Ken and Barbie were hilarious!!! I loved this film, in my personal opinion this is the best Toy Story film out of the three. I'm so glad that they took there time preparing it so it wouldn't be a massacre. I highly recommend this movie to all ages."
5,This one is the best of all!,"Not many times you can say that the third movie is the best, but this movie is so impressive. Has a great story line, funny, graphics are amazing, and at the end, it took effort not to get misty eyed. LOVED IT and so did my 3 1/2 yr old. An awesome movie the whole family can enjoy."
5,"Movie's great, but don't pre-order","Everyone already knows the movie is great, and I love the combo pack. But this is the first and last time I will pre-order. I didn't receive it until a full 7 days after release date, even though it only had to travel 30 miles. And it cost the same as it would have had I just picked it up mystelf at Target. Lesson learned."
5,A classic,"My family and I are huge fans of anything Pixar, but the Toy Story series are the best. Toy Story 3 is by far the most emotional and heart wrenching of the three. When you know this is the last one in the series, when you've seen the relationships develop through the years, you cannot help but tear up and cry during the movie. Ok, so my daughter is going off to college this year and everything in this movie hit close to home as well. If you have a heart and soul, you cannot help but be affected by this movie. Kudos to Pixar for producing such quality entertainment that touches us so deeply that you forget it's an animated flick. We're going to miss you, Toy Story crew!"
5,Excelente!!!,"Tal vez no la mejor pelicula de la trilogia de Toy Story pero es una pelicula que te traera muchos recuerdos de cuando fuiste niño, creciste tuviste que deshacerte de tus juguetes, tiene muy bonito mensaje, la recomiendo mucho!!!"
2,Poor quality printing,"I bought this book because I thought it was a good starting point and aproach to video editing. But it's a little to much saying ""The Complete Technical Guide"".The printing quality is very poor. When I saw the preview images at Amazon I though they where digitized in low resolution, well, they where printed in low res... in a few cases the font size changes along the page, like in bad photocopies.This book has 360pages which could be easily reduced to 180 with proper formating and discarding information like movie titles, company adresses and websites (?), it would be pratical a single link to a webpage gathering all links to the companies they refer, and others on the way.If you aren't sure, there are better options. Unless it has 50% off... serious considering return it."
4,A pro editing book to keep handy,"Chapter 3, ""Beginnings, Middles and Ends"" is my favorite chapter. Not only does it start with teaching editing, but it makes an very good introductory effort to communicate the aesthetic concepts involved with the craft of editing. It starts appropriately with the tradition of storytelling and goes on to discuss different editing workflows (bricklayer vs. sculptor), the concept of the montage, techniques for continuity editing, Pace and Rhythm, and offers ""Five Guidelines of Editing"".Overall I was amazed at not only how much was covered in a single book, but at how valuable the information was that was provided.I recommend this book. I can see it as a text source for video editing instructors, and for anyone that wants to get started in the craft of editing."
2,"Too Much Description, too Little Heart","Ms Blake used so much description that it was difficult to follow the story. Someone would say something, then two pages later some one would answer. It was confusing and very hard to read.The concept of the story should have made a great telling, but I missed any emotional development between the two main characters.I bought the Louisiana Plantation Collection very cheap, so it was no great loss for me. I will read the rest of the collection, but I hope future stories are better than this one."
1,Churchill Cereal bowls not made in england,"I ordered the cereal bowls to go with my set of Churchill. The bowls were not made in England and were of a slightly different size then the ones I already have that were made in England. These bowls are stamped on the bottom ""Churchill Made by Colombia"". I feel Amazon should have asked if I would accept a substitue before shipping the bowls to me. I could have sent them back but felt after paying for that postage it would have been a no win situation for me."
3,Kiss Killer,It's a good documentary about the hottest band in the world it's not the better but for a collector it's an important piece of collection
5,"Great mixer, great price",We are very pleased with it. Appearance was brand new. Functioning very well.No problems.
2,Kitchen Aid Quality has gone down,"The biggest dissapointment was the paddle, beater, and hook that came with this. NOT the same quality as it used to be- in fact these state ""not dishwasher safe, may discolor"". They have to be joking, everything should be made dishwasher safe in this day and age.So not caring if mine ""dicolored"" I washed them in the dishwasher anyway, and let me say discoloring will be the least of your problems. They got this weird white dust all over them, like rust but white. They are light weight and feel cheap, which is what they are.Also they really do not mix anything in from the bottom of the bowl and I know I had the bowl in properly. My mom's Kitchen Aid appears to have come from a different company as the quality is 1000x better. I have dreamt about getting my first Kitchen Aid for so long, and this was a huge dissapointment."
4,Great so far,I bought this refurbished mixer with a little hesitation based on some of the bad reviews I've read about them breaking down. But decided to give it a shot since I've wanted one of these for so long. It did not disappoint. I love it. I have done dough in this mixer as well as batters and it works great.
3,MISREPRESENTED BUT OVERALL FUN,"THE ITEM DESCRIPTION INDICATES IT HAS A ""HUGE 14'4 LONG WATERSLIDE AND CLIMBING WALL FOR EASY ACCESS."" WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU IS THAT THE ""CLIMBING WALL"" IS PART OF THE ""14'4"" FEET.I BOUGHT THIS SLIDE FOR MY SONS 8TH BIRTHDAY PARTY AND WHILE IT IS GREAT FUN...THE KIDS LOST INTEREST SOON, PARTIALLY DUE TO THELENGTH OF THE SLIDE ONLY BEING A 6 FOOT DROP.OVERALL LENGTHS ARE 7 FOOT CLIMBING WALL6 FOOT WATERSLIDE1.4 FOOT EDGE THAT IS IN THE POOLFOR PROTECTION"
1,Waste of money,"I bought this today. It says it's a 14 FOOT slide. The slide is (maybe) 6 feet long, and it's about 10 feet tall including the archway. I have no clue where it came up with 14 feet. ALSO, it says the weight limit is 200 pounds. A friend who is 180 went on it once and hit the ground. Total waste of money."
2,Why Reggaeton ???,"I like the Ruff Ryders crew, but why the hell they have to do reggaeton. Reggaeton sucks. I'm a 100% puertorican but I'm also a 100% true hip hop. The Only thing good on this album is DMX,LOx & Akon. Don't buy this cd."
2,wat the hell is goin on,"ive listened to this album once i only like track one 'ruff ryders for life' and that 'get wild' track only coz its produced by scott storch..over all dis album aint all datone more thing WHAT THE HELL IS TRACK 18, that aint rap thats pop music man...whats happened ruff ryders"
4,Very good performance and sound,"I've enjoyed this CD both for its spirited performance and its warm and clear sound. But I must add that I still prefer the older Berg CD for its insight and, above all, the LP version of the Italian Quartet."
5,Highly Recommend,"As in the other reviews of these N T Wright's books, I love his unique approach and style. The books are challenging, but he does a great job helping me understand."
3,Co-starring the Gingerdead Man,"The third entry in the Gingerdead Man series is really a roller disco comedy with occasional cameo appearances by the Gingerdead Man. He's far from the main character or main focus of the film, which is mostly about a roller queen contest to save a roller rink that might have to shut down because of unpaid taxes. The Gingerdead Man himself is just a weird sidebar in his own movie.The CGI is terrible, and the Gingerdead Man looks different from the previous films. The lame-o puppetry was one of the things that made parts 1 and 2 so ""great,"" so I didn't care for his new look. I would have much rather seen little puppet legs walking around than this poorly animated CGI action.Worth watching if you're into the series, but I think the second film was the best of the three, despite having some seriously annoying characters."
4,Gingerdead 3 is wellworth 3 solid viewings!,"As far as fun, this movie's got it. If you're a fan of the evil and edible, you will really dig this film! Thank you for hooking me up with this dvd that plays perfect and may as well have been plucked right off the 'new' assembly line. The receipt of this disk was in record time as well! Again, I thank you Amazon for being true to your consumers. I will definitely be back for more good deals!"
3,Happy Halloween!!!,"I received this in the mail on Halloween, just in time. It's still better than the original, but very silly. It spoofs Saturday Night Fever, Silence of the Lambs, Carrie, Porky's, Tootsie, and more. The little Gingerdead man is back and more brutal and foul-mouthed than ever. When he's sent back to 1976, he decides to kill the contestants of a roller-disco contest. Cherry Wright (Carrie spoof) is the new girl that everyone picks on, but she's given a makeover and becomes more popular. She falls in love, but tries to kill the evil Gingerdead man before time runs out. This will probably be the last in the trilogy. If you want a silly horror flick, you might enjoy GINGERDEAD MAN 3: SATURDAY NIGHT CLEAVER!!!"
2,I Don't Work In Meat So I Found It Pointless!!,"Since I don't work in Meat this book is obviously not worth the money. While I enjoy eating meat quality control on meat is not that important to me. But I also think cows being slaughterd is funny and really tasty. To quote shakespeare, ""To Be Or Not To Be..."" Now don't I sound smart."
1,Zzzzzzzzz,"My reason for the negative review is pretty much what others have said.... the author has tried really really hard to be a ""complicated"" and sophisticated writer but ends up being boring and unnecessarily verbose. The descriptions are not descriptive but instead all over the place and so complicated that you lose track of what actually is going on. Moreover, super boring characters..."
4,Very cool!,"As a Dante fanatic, I wasn't sure what to expect. This book rocks! It's a real treat for someone like me (although I'm not a big Longfellow fan). Demands more than one reading.Afterlife - An Introduction to Dante's Inferno"
4,Murder by Translation,"Great fun to read how some of our favorite classic poets and writers become involved in murders that they suspect they themselves are causing. The author develops the personalities of Longfellow, Russell and Holmes as they struggle to translate Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" which in turn inspires ""someone"" to murder."
4,Wonderfully original,"I expected this to be a cheap imitation ofThe Dumas Club, but in fact it is wonderfully original. It is a fictional portrayal of historical characters - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. - who are at work translating Dante, and then come across a series of horrible murders inspired by scenes from theInferno."
3,"Good writing, uneven story telling...","I enjoyed the writing and the historical component of this book. I found the story to be a bit jagged with little chance of actually figuring out who the killer is until the very end.However, it did introduce me to some of Dante's, as well as Longfellow's prose, so it was worth it."
2,"A nice idea, but way too dull","This was well written, in that it was in English, and I understood it, but when it was over I sighed and said, ""So what?""The book was recommended reading after enjoying The Rule of Four, but it didn't do it for me. I think Pearl should have written a nice short story and been done with it. It simply dragged out too long. Like this review."
2,Writing style is very tedious!,"We chose this book for our neighborhood Book Group. Of the 12 members, only three of us were even able to finish it. Very hard to get in to, most gave up before page 100. But, even those of us who keep going found it very plodding and tedious. A good plot, but, his writing style definitely got in the way of the story."
3,Not great but not terrible,"This is the author's first novel and it shows. He's a little too impressed with himself and that shows too, making it hard to take the narrative seriously at times. The murders were horrifyingly disgusting which is good or bad depending on your tastes (I liked it). This is a hard book to get into but it is fairly entertaining if you're not expecting too much. Coincidences abound. The solution made me think, ""Wait, what? Really? That person? Well alright. I guess I can go with that."" If you have a long commute it's good for passing the time. I basically enjoyed it once I put all the rave reviews out of my head."
4,"""A Fable for the Critics""","Borrowing a title that Pearl attributes to the works of his character, the poet and teacher Robert Lowell, I see ""The Dante Club"" as a 'fable' for Dante scholars.Pearl has depended on the 'light-heartedness' of a who-dunn-it mystery to interpret some gruesome images in ""The Divne Comedy.""I feel that I've read a well-crafted book that makes light of historical realism. I don't, however, feel that I've read the original, Dante's own ""Divine Comedy."" (As I admit regretfully, I've not yet read Dante.)Pearl's novel is a tentalizing lure to discover Dante in a specific historical moment. It comes across as a fabulus tale of presenting Dante to 'our' America who is always seeking its own identity and unity."
3,Good first novel,"Author is a Dante scholar and his erudition is evident throughout the book. Historical characters (Lowell, Longfellow, Holmes, et al) are fun, but sometimes seem like caricatures. About half- to two-thirds the way through, the pace starts to drag a bit. It accelerates in the last 50 pages or so, but there were precious few clues for the reader to figure out who the murderer was. But still recommend the book for those who like mysteries, historical novels, and/or Dante."
2,Tedious,"I really found it difficult to finish this book. I am an avid reader of literary historical fiction, and this book was, well, pretentious and boring. I eagerly anticipated the point at which the story would become compelling. Didn't happen. Try ""The Piano Tuner"", granted, a different genre, yet quite a compelling story."
1,Pretentious and Boring,"The concept has everything for someone interested, as I am, in thrillers and mysteries with an intellectual twist. Sad to say, the execution of the concept lacks everything but the intellectual content. The writing is pretentious in the extreme, full of pseudo antiquarianisms. The characters are as thin as the paper the book is printed on. Basing some of them on famous people doesn't help a bit. Mystery plotting is lame and the climax is predictable. And, oh, does one have to wait for the end to come! This is one of the few books I have been tempted to heave across the room into the fireplace, if I had one."
5,Have a Great Time with This One,"Can I just say ---- Wow! ""The Dante Club"" is a perfect summer read for literature lovers: it's light enough to allow for rabid page turning but with more substance and intelligence than the standard best seller. The post-Civil War world of 1865 Boston is brought to vivid life, the characters are a delight, and you can just tell that Pearl is having great fun putting his plot together. The novel takes itself seriously enough to keep us engrossed but not so seriously that it forgets to be a joy.If you liked ""The Alienist,"" you'll probably like ""The Dante Club."" And no worries if you lack knowledge about Dante or his ""Divine Comedy."" I'd never read it, but Pearl does a fine job of making his novel accessible to Dante fans as well as novices.This is one of those books that I actually forced myself to stop reading at times because I didn't want to finish it too quickly. As it is, I am sad that it's over.Grade: A+"
2,"Evocative, but a poor payoff","I enjoyed the setting, found the period evocation nicely done, and liked the historical characters. The denouement of the mystery was weak and left me disappointed."
5,Superlative Historical/Literary Murder Mystery,"Pearl has elevated the genre of historical crime mystery with The Dante Club. Few books are worth depriving oneself of sleep, food or social interaction for a few days, but this is one of them!Don't miss it."
4,Web of Intrigue,"Part Arthur Conan Doyle and Edgar Allan Poe, Matthew Pearl spins a web of intrigue nearly impossible to escape. I admit to setting it down once, finding the dizzying barrage of characters relentless. But after I mapped out each introduction, the book instantly came alive. A weak ending and a few inconsistencies are easily forgiven. It isn't high literature, but it will surely pull you into Dante's hellish nightmare if you let it."
2,Over-reaching,"Pearl is so in love with Dante, as will be evident if you read his bio, that he has to let everybody know how good Dante is. Unfortunately, he sacrifices the story to tell you just how much he really Really REALLY L*O*V*E*S Dante. Well, great, and so do I, but this could have been a much tighter, better book with the help of a good editor to tone that aspect down.Also, Pearl gives away a good chunk of the plot fairly early on with a literary conceit that was so obvious I couldn't really believe he was going to make me, or his hyper-intellectual characters, sit through another 180 pages to prove it out. Gee, maybe the cast of this book wasn't so bright after all!"
3,A Great Reader,"The mystery of a serial killer using Dante's INFERNO as a blueprint for his murders is subserviant to the story of the elite of Boston's intellectual society's efforts to write the first American translation of Dante's great work in Matthew Pearl's debut novel. The real reason for listening to this audio book, however, is for Boyd Gaines's great work as narrator. Gaines has to be one of the best readers in the United States today. He not only changes his voice for every character, he changes accents easily as well. Even women have distinctive voices that are feminine sounding without being the breathy airheads most actors make them sound. Another great work in audio narration from this actor!"
3,Overrated,"So much I read about The Dante Club (but not, however, all that I read) led me to believe that this was another thinking-person's mystery along the lines of Caleb Carr's terrific The Alienist from several years back. It is, but it isn't. It is a well-written historically-based murder mystery with a clever premise, written by an obviously brilliant Dante scholar. But the novel is lacking a certain something to make it really great. It doesn't ever come together--I found nothing to make me care about what happened, nothing compelling me to keep reading. I see from other reviews that many others absolutely loved this novel and I am sure that many reading this review will agree with them. If you haven't read the novel yet, don't be surprised if it's not as good as the hype machine would have you believe."
3,"Okay, but no more","Mr. Pearl knows how to plot. Unfortunately his writing isn't up to the same standard. His prose style is stodgy and the characters are flat. Still, I look forward to his next effort which ought to bring some improvement."
1,"Boring, Boring, Gone","I love well written books, some badly written books, this one is out of the ballpark when it comes to BORING. I have always finished a book, until now, this was the worse book I have attempted to read in 30 years."
3,Falls Short at the End,"Which is too bad because I was thoroughly enjoying this book up until the last 50 or so pages. What is good about the book can be read in the other reviews so I'll just skip to what disappointed me in this story.Please don't continue reading if you don't want plot revealed.When the identity of the murdered is revealed it's quite anti-climactic. It's also wholly unbelievable to me. This book has well written characters. The entire plot revolves around the recreation of horrific punishments lifted from the pages of Dante's The Divine Comedy. The sequence of events is cleverly woven together heading towards the climax of the novel. So, how can the actual perpetrator of these crimes, who is introduced quite late in the story, be so poorly written? I would have been happy to read another 10 or 20 pages if that would have helped develop the character further. I didn't believe for a minute he was the actual killer and that left me disappointed in the ending."
2,Slow and boring,"Okay, I thought this book sounded interesting. Kind of like The Secret History; thought-provoking and invoking literature that I love. Rather, I found a plodding and boring story. The last time I put a book down before I finished reading was in 1995. Sadly, I've done it again. The second star, however, is for concept. It was a great sounding concept; sadly, it didn't deliver."
3,The Fireside Poets Sold Short,"Imagine my delight when a book came forth with some of my favorite authors in a mystery novel. For many years I have owned the collected works of James Russel Lowell, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. Bringing these literati together to solve heinous crimes sounded much better than what the book delivers. The Dante Club reads haltingly. The characters don't ring with any real color. I mean, this is Longellow, after all! The scenes of post-Civil War Cambridge are sketchy and the plot is forced, until the last 50 pages, when it breaks down altogether. I was happy to greet famous names in turn--Ticknor, Houghton, Agassiz, and George Washington Greene, and many historical and political figures are woven into the plot. However, at no time could I just settle in and turn pages. It always seemed a little at arms length, and a little like work. Please don't believe any comparisons between Pearl and Caleb Carr."
1,Drudgery,"Seldom do I abandon a novel before I have given it a fair chance and read it at least half way through. The writing style is awkward, the story has many irrelevant asides and drags the reader out into endless boredom. This work is nothing short of drudgery. Try ""An Instance of the Fingerpost"" by Iain Pears instead - brilliant historical fiction."
2,If only I could finish it...,I have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask. I have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it. Although the first few pages were very catching with the author immediately opening with a murder scene that is discribed with enormous detail; it just doesn't click for me. I f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline. Surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but I just cannot do it my self.
2,Glad that's over.,"Matthew Pearl chose such an intriguing premise for his first novel that I really wanted to like it. In the end, however, I don't recommend this book. There are a number of unearned plot twists, a couple of pivotal characters whose motivations are never explained, and a denouement that (yawn), reminds us that the whole psycho-killer plotline has been done to death. And, in this case, not very well.Note: I listened to the abridged version of this book on CD, over a couple of days during drive time. The reader, John Seidman, gets four stars. He has a nice voice and if he hadn't gotten so precious in doing the characterizations of Longfellow's daughters, I'd have given him five stars. Nice work."
2,confusing,"I don't understand this book at all. I tried starting over, but by page 50, I still don't get it.While I know who the subjects are, I'm not familiar with their history, nor do I really know the history of that time period. Perhaps if I did, this book would be easier to understand."
3,Fair,"Characters become a bit cartoonish, and you absolutely will not want to hear, read or see the name ""Dante"" for some time after you finish this book."
2,This book reminds me of another...,"I couldn't shake the very basic similarities between this and GHOST STORY by P. Straub, unfortunately."
3,"Fascinating subjects, but short on thrills.","Matthew Pearl has managed to write an appealing historical novel that centers on the real-life members of the first Dante Club in America. The writing is historically accurate and the information you get about people like Oliver Wendell Holmes, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and James Russell Lowell, as well as 19th-century Boston, is truly fascinating. However, placing these people into a thriller and having them solve a series of murders which appear linked to Dante's Inferno seems a bit contrived. This is a plot device that seems to be used to the point of exhaustion, taking famous literary personalities from the past and turning them into detectives. Frankly, I for one have tired of it."
4,there's some hope left...,"I recently got in this mystery-esoteric information kick ever since I read ""The Da Vinci Code."" ""The Dante Club"" is around the same neighborhood of advanced information and mysterious murders, except this time around, everything takes place in history.I won't compare this to ""The Da Vinci Code"" since both have their strong suits. ""The Dante Club"" showcases a group of interesting characters (taken from real-life figures). My only complaint was that the ending wasn't as beautifully rendered. The writing style serves well, even though the initial descriptions of Dante's hells disturbed me a bit.I do recommend this book, even though it does not draw me into an adrenaline-filled adventure and some plot points were forced. However, several fascinating characters and back-stories make up for all this."
4,Not-So-Predictable Murder-Mystery,"For those who loves Dante's Inferno, civil war history, and murder-mysteries. The read takes some getting used to b/c it's a bit slow in the beginning and everybody talks like Stewie from the Family Guy, though the book keeps you guessing until the end."
4,A great mystery,"A novel in the style of the Da Vinci Code (honestly, how many books are there out there that are being compared to it?), The Dante Club focuses on a group of scholars at Harvard University (who were real people, I might add) who use Dante's Inferno to solve a series of murders. Its a good, exciting, and thrilling read, one that I couldn't put down. Matthew Pearl did an amazing job on the historical research, and he excelled at re-creating the characters of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Longfellow, Lowell, and others. Pearl also took the idea of the first black policeman in post-war America and gave the character some shape. I encourage Dante fans to read this book."
3,"Overrated, moments of greatness, but need to plow...","I think that the author had a wonderful idea...but except for one 'gathering' of the Dante Club which brings together figures larger than life and imagines their interaction, the novel becomes almost ... arduous. Pacing is uneven and gives the impression of a car travelling over various road surfaces...where it is paved, wow, but around that bend is that patch of quicksand...The ending felt like an afterthought, unsatisfying, almost a footnote. The latter parts of the book are almost sketchy, as if some middle part was edited severely, or the vision didn't properly extend to the end of the story.It is interesting in the way Unberto Eco's work of a murder mystery in a historical time/place was interesting, but not as fully formed or even as that work. It is worth a read, but adjust your expectations...the delta between hype and real can sink the book."
2,Lo he donado a una biblioteca,"Apesar de las excelentes criticas cosechadas por Pearl, que presumía una lectura interesante y capaz de enganchar al lector, El Club Dante es un tocho soporifero que me ha sido impsible concluir. La lectura se convierte en un lento via crucis para el sufrido lector. El autor contaba con excelentes mimbres para haber hecho una novela fantástica o al menos entretenida y sin embargo, se ha marcado un engendro confuso y horroroso dificil de digerir. Me duele tener que dejar libros a la mitad pero mi tiempo es muy valioso y cuando tengo un rato libre delante de un libro quiero disfrutar no pasearme por el Inferno de Dante."
4,Quite Suspenseful and Education,"I highly recommend this book. Very cohesive story line and the characters were very well developed. Full of surprises as well.Finally, I appreciate how this book married fictional and non-fiction elements which makes this novel not only entertaining, but also educational. BUY IT!"
5,The Dante Club,"Having read ""La Divina Commedia"" in Italian with the assistance of Longfellow's Translation I was right back in the Inferno.A book that could not be put down until finished and not wanting it to end.It will be highly recommended to my bookclub next month."
3,Not bad for a first book,"I picked up this book after reading many of the reviews on Amazon and in several magazines. Overall I was not disappointed.The story moves along quite rapidly and even though I typically figure out ""who dunnit"" before the final clues are given, I didn't see the murderer until the last clue.I found all the historical information to be quite interesting. I realized half way through The Dante CLub that I have never read all of the Divine Comedy and am now interested enough to pursue it.Additionally, the historical information was fascinating. I found myself going on the net and researching the main characters. I like books that make me want to go find out more.This is a fast read, but well crafted."
5,Best Lecture I've had in a Long Time,"Matthew Pearl has written an amazing mystery with enough insight to rival any seminar on Dante available. Throughout the book there are situations where two of our literary figure heroes are looking at the evidence and one of them will comment on relevent Dante information. The other will argue with a conflicting interpretation or will ask for more details. And you want to know those views or you want to know more also. Like any good mystery, you soak up the details because you think you can solve the mystery before the characters in the book can. Mr. Pearl makes learning, forgive me for saying this, fun. I can think of a few classes that I've taken that would benefit from this book being on the syllabus..."
2,"Creative plot, but poor writing style kills this book.","I wanted to read this because I had just read The Inferno. The plot was intriguing, but the writing style was inferior. He can't seem to write a smooth, flowing narrative, and I got very frustrated with his choppy style. I had to force myself to finish it. Very disappointing."
2,"Sorry, Dante....","The author may be a Dante scholar but he is not yet a secure novelist. The Dante twist is a clever, entertaining plot device but the characters are dreadfully flat. The author supplies clues that are helpful in identifying the characters but these clues become annoying in a very short time: if facial hair is mentioned, it's Lowell; if a recalcitrant son is nearby, it's Holmes; if it's Annie Allegra asking for help with homework, it's Longfellow. I won't go into the maggots and blowflies...."
3,mediocre,I completely agree with the person who said it was like the Da Vinci Code rolled back 150 years. Enough said.
1,excellent sleeping-aid,"This book is more intereseting as a historical document than a novel. And if I wanted to read the first, I would have a picked up a biography of Longfellow.Anyway, the plot is not too bad. To answer the reader questions: no I would not have guessed the offender correctlt, since he played only such minor part in the story before the last chapters.But what really put me off -and why I would never recommend the book too anyone- is the tedious way the writer slows down the story. Honestly, if you have problems sleeping you'll be cured just by reading this."
2,A tedious read,"I was very interested in this book before reading it. There were a great many rave reviews about it and the book was often recommended to me. It is very clear that this author is highly intelligent and knows a great deal about his subject, HOWEVER....there was no point during this book in which I was positively riveted or ever really felt much for any of the characters. Perhaps the author was trying to cover too much ground in his use of famous characters...I don't know. I was pretty disappointed. Even though I did not care for this book at all, I would still be interested to read something else by this author."
2,Too Many Tangents,Thoughtful plot but too drawn out and many tangent situations which induced a severe case of bordom while reading. Was hard to finish but did manage. Good scene descriptions of 1865 Boston/Cambridge/Harvard. Crimes were reminiscent of THE ALIENIST which was a better book. All in all not a bad effort for a first novel although I agree with an earlier reviewer that the editor should have done a better job.
4,Enjoyable,I rather enjoyed this book. I felt that the ending was rather rush but it was good none the less. I just loved Dr. Holmes.Also recommended: Silverlock. River God by Wilbur Smith (excellent).
5,A Fascinating Blend of both History and Fiction,"The Dante Club takes the reader to the world of 1865 when America's most famous poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is creating the first American translation of Italy's most famous poet Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedia. While in this translation process, a string of murders are mirroring the very acts that Dante wrote about.This intriguing murder mystery is a tightly woven (fictional) historical narrative that puts the reader in the center of Boston society. A well researched book, it is every bit as gripping as the more recent (and well known) The Da Vinci Code, only much better written and thought out. A great story even for those that have never read Dante's voyage through hell and heaven."
2,A show book?,"""I have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask. I have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it. ""Psh. That's nothing. I've had mine for over a year, and still haven't finished it. For starters, the characters aren't especially likeable. And the author seems more intent on impressing us with his (obviously thorough) research than on telling a good story.I suspect this is a show book: One of those books folks buy because it looks good to have on one's bookshelf, but that doesn't necessarily get read.I was disappointed."
4,Good historical fiction,"This is a murder mystery novel set in post Civil War Boston. The book centers around a who's who of American writers (Longfellow, Holmes, Lowell, and publisher JT Fields), who use their unbelievably detailed understanding of Dante to help catch the killer. The work is well researched and has a few good plot twists.At times it is a bit slow, and the dialogue sometimes doesn't sound believable. If you enjoy historical fiction then chances are you'll enjoy this. Pretty good first novel for the author."
4,Dante club,"Very interesting, first chapters hard to get into but the story moved very well once it was laid out. Love historical fiction."
3,"The Promise of Paradiso, the Reality of Purgatorio",Mr. Pearl's novel starts out complex and interesting only to bottom out into the most cliché of who-done-its.Initially the character development (historic characters no less) and the writing style keep the pages turning. Midway through you realize there are only so many ways to describe a man's mustache and you wonder why is must be described at such great length (no pun intended) each time.I became disinterested about 3/4 the way through and skipped to the end.
2,Sadly Disappointing,"I thought that this would be the perfect book for a long trip. An interesting premise; a group of famous 19th century poets turned detectives. Wrong again. The author managed to entirely ruin the experience for me with some of the most stilted, corny, cliched, writing I have encountered in quite a while. Toward the end of the book I found myself constantly looking for the next plot hole or absurd coincidence. I should have been forewarned by the number of ""blurbs"" at the front and on the Amazon editorial page. I have generally found that the quality of a novel is inversley proportional to the number of ""blurb bites."" Obviously Mr Pearl can write well, as evidenced by his comments in the ""conversation with the author"" notes at the end of my paperback copy. Perhaps he should have taken some creative writing courses after Law School before writing this novel."
3,Over hyped in my opinion...,"All of the positive things I've heard about The Dante Club led me to believe that this was another thinking-person's mystery along the lines of Caleb Carr's terrific The Alienist from several years back. Well... it is a somewhat good mystery, but not as brilliant as The Alienist, and that's putting it mildly. It is a well-written historically-based murder mystery with a clever premise, written by an obviously brilliant Dante scholar. But the novel lacks a certain something that keeps it from being special. It doesn't ever come together. I found nothing to make me care about what happened and nothing compelled me to keep reading. I see from other reviews that many others absolutely loved this novel and I am sure that many reading this review will agree with them. If you haven't read the novel yet, don't be surprised if it's not as good as the hype machine would have you believe."
2,"More like ""Unholy Bore"" than ""Divine Comedy""","Like a very bumpy flight to Asia, ""Dante Club"" is both nauseating and boring, with long patches where you just want to stare out the window instead of turn pages. I never quite recovered from an extended maggot-fest in the first chapter, rendered in prose that unsuccessfully channels Thomas Harris of ""Silence of the Lambs"" fame. I stuck with it because I love Dante, and was waiting for some exegesis or at least a novel take on his masterpiece. However, there are far more burrowing larvae and rotting limbs in this book than glimpses of ""The Divine Comedy."" And Pearl manages the trick of having his 19th-century characters mouth 21st-century Harvard pomposity and cant on post-traumatic stress. I admire the author's obvious immersion in history of the period, but this book was much overpraised and the hype surrounding it will probably prevent the author from getting the training in fiction writing that he so badly needs."
1,Don't bother,"I was expecting a good mystery with a Dante backdrop, but instead found an utterly dull story featuring great authors rendered as poor caricatures. I couldn't finish it."
2,Overwrought writing,"This is the most overwrought prose I have encountered in a long time. The character's dialog is like they are making speeches at each other. The opening paragraph gives it all away, and if you like that, you will love wading through this book. If you like to figure out what a story is all about, you will probably like this book but the story is not worth the effort. If you want to enjoy the same sensation he tries to provoke, go back to the Hot Zone by Preston. That one will scare your skivies off.Although he got an endorsement from Dan Brown, the story is nothing like DaVinci Code and does not equal its pace or excitement."
3,Exciting Story...Dull Storytelling,"""The Dante Club"" is a maddening near-hit (or is it near-miss?) of a mystery. The plot is ingenious, the denouement truly a surprise, but the writing is so heavy, so lifeless that the whole thing never takes off. The book was intended to be in the class of ""The Alienist,"" but Pearl isn't a skilled enough storyteller to come close to matching that book's excitement and energy. Too bad, because the story itself is clever and well thought out, and I was kept guessing whodunit until the very end. If only Pearl were as facile with words as his literary heroes."
1,How many people do I know who didnt finish this book???,Everyone I lent it to...including myself. Growing up my father taught me to always finish the book because sometimes the end makes it all worth it and you shouldnt get into a habit of just quitting a book. Well since I've been reading this is only the third book I've never finished. I struggled to read this and finally couldnt force myself anymore. There were times I would read a page and it was so dull i realized that i didnt really even read it and had to go back and try it again. The best thing about this book was the description on the back of it. The story dragged on and I didnt find it really took me anywhere. I really suggest going to the book store and reading the fist two or three chapters before wasting your money on this book. I think the average reader wont enjoy this book. You really need to love history which I dont mind reading but this was simply overkill. I think the book doesnt deserve all the hype!
4,The characters were free,"The Dante Club is a delightful read about a fictional series of murders that shake the Cambridge literary circle of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow shortly after the end of the Civil War. The characters were free -- historical personages set into the fictional piece conceived by Matthew Pearl. I thought Pearl handled them well and made them seem quite human. The centerpiece of the story is Dante's Divine Comedy. If you have already read Dante, by all means, read this book and enjoy. If you have not yet read Dante, put this book down and read Dante immediately. Do not wait until you have learned Italian -- there are several excellent English translations available in inexpensive editions."
3,"Original Concept, Bad Audio Abridgement","The Dante Club is one of the most original story concepts to come along in awhile. The story take place in post-Civil War Boston/Cambridge and someone is killing well-known residents using Dante's Inferno as inspiration -- very original. Boyd Gaines does a relatively good job narrating the story, giving distinct Bostonian accents to each of the characters; although, one did sound too much like Thurston Howell, III. Even with the original concept and excellent historical characters, this reading suffered from a choppy abridgement. At times it seemed like the story jumped entire chapters. If you love a good, original, historically researched mystery, then The Dante Club is a good choice, even with the bad abridgement."
2,Will it ever end or can he wrap it up?,"I'm sorry, maybe it is my ignorance, but I found this book very choppy and boorish and difficult to get through. I didn't like the way it jumped to the Civil War scenes near the end though I understand the purpose. I will give Pearl credit for mentioning ""post traumatic stress syndrome"" and ""civil war"" together which I'm sure was a reality for many Civil War veterans even though the syndrome didn't come into vogue until after the Vietnam war. Why is Longfellow made out to be such a hero while Oliver Wendall Holmes and James Russell Lowell have a proper amount of human weakness? The character Nicholas Rey didn't seem to fit into the time of the novel. The mystery got lost in all the long drug out scenes of Dante Club meetings and the following of endless suspicious characters with dead-end conclusions. It was messy even though it most likely involved a lot of research. I think I'll skip the Poe mystery."
1,Reach far exceeds grasp,"I hated this book.I wanted to love it, but the author's obsequiousness continued to put me off.Repeated mis-use of syntax; placing unbelievable 1990's words and phrasing in the mouths of major, literary characters from the mid-1800's; poor pacing and transition in the first two-thirds of the novel -- all created a framework of high annoyance, and not delight.In truth, the concept for this work was terrific. The author should get high marks for it. His EDITOR, however, should be fired, and banned from any future editorial employment.A much better attempt at this genre was The Alienist, by the accomplished Caleb Carr. Carr created an utterly believable world. Pearl's world is, by comparison, populated by video game characters, stilted and stiff, always a long run away from credibility."
1,"Very slow, over-rated overall","Not a real stinker, but not the amazing 4-5 star book I expected after reading such rave reviews.The book was OK, but it was very very hard to get into, tedious in fact. The plot could have used more juice, and a good editor should have seen this and worked with the author."
1,fictional novels that feature historical figures...,are invariably bad. and this one is no different from the rest (another waste-of-time in this same vein is 'the eight').avoid
2,Enough already.,"While the plot is creative and the author sets some interesting scenes with great detail, this is a laborious read. I felt that the author was trying too hard to prove his brilliance to the reader.Many of the sentences were too complex and the language was inefficient. While that style is reminicient of literature of the era, it made tedious what could have been a dynamic storyline."
2,"Nice Concept, But Too Slow","The concept is unique and intriguing: Post Civil War Boston, creative murders based on Dante's Inferno, a club of Harvard highbrows involved in both.The author does a nice job describing 1800s Boston, including using the dialogue of those times, although a bit distracting. There was too much emphasis on the scholars who were members of the Dante Club, and there could have been more emphasis on the murders themselves.This book is very slow moving, and several times I almost put it down for good. Mercifully I got to the end. If you don't mind very slow moving books, and like the setting and the concept, then give it a try. For me, I often found myself using this to help me fall asleep at night."
2,Slow...,"While I can certainly appreciate Mr. Pearl's idea for this book and the research and effort that went into writing it, I must say I found it unbelievably slow and plodding. I honestly had to force myself to finish it. I would suggest to anyone wishing to read this book that they familiarize themselves with Dante's DIVINE COMEDY. Since I am not as familiar with it as I could be, it made it that much more difficult to get through the book."
3,Scooby Doo with famous Americans,"I found this book interesting because I was living next door to Longfellow's house at the time I read it and I am a Bostonian. So it was interesting to see what Boston was like then for these famous people.However, the plot turned from interesting to ridiculous. And then it simply felt like a Scooby Doo episode with famous American literati. Zoinks."
2,"Been There, Read That","Matthew Pearl's ""The Dante Club"" is simply a cookie-cutter mystery with fancy trimmings. The trimmings in this instance being a killer driven mad by the images of Hell in Dante's ""Inferno."" The club of the title is a group of the original Boston Brahmins, including Oliver Wendell Holmes (the comic relief), Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, etc, who are working together on the first American translation of ""The Divine Comedy."" The average plot and the obvious solution are slightly offset by Pearl's deft handling of Dante's work. A subplot about the first African American police officer in Boston serves no purpose at all. For exciting period mysteries, try ""The Alienist"" or ""The Quincunx."""
1,Pompous and boring,"This is a terrible book. It is so boring and so poorly written that I used it as a sleep aid. The extravagant praise from professional reviewers and readers is completely mystifying, unlike the book itself. Everyone I know who has read the book feels the same way I do, making the preponderance of positive reviews even more puzzling.This is my 2nd negative review for this book. My first review was suppressed by Amazon. I don't know why. It met Amazon's stated guidelines. Maybe there are so few negative reviews because they're being suppressed? This would be a conspiracy far more interesting than any mystery in this dreadful book."
2,Russian edition,I've read this book in Russian language. In my mind it was bad translation so it was difficult to read.
2,wait for the paperback,"If you are looking for a Cliff notes summary of Dante's Inferno, the Dante Club may be a good choice. Though called ""A Novel"" it reads more like a play with a small ensemble of ready made characters and with all the action centered at the Craigie house. The Nicholas Rey character seemed out of place and while it may have helped set create the atmosphere in Boston during that time, he doesn't contribute anything critical to the story. Like Rey, the rest of the cast fit the formula for mass-market mystery novels. The story lacks its own Virgil. It needed a Beatrice or Francesca to create tension. Figuring out who was behind the murders is obvious from the time of this character's introduction. In summary, it's an okay book for a quick read but wait until it comes out in paperback or they make the movie."
3,A great idea that loses momentum,"For a popular fiction novel, it was quite good. At the beginning, I was really into the mystery and tried to solve it along with the heroes of the story.The idea of having a killer copy Dante was intriguing, and the scenes where the bodies are found are full of detail and gruesome to imagine. I also liked the idea of having four of America's literary giants try and solve a mystery.After a while, the story got kind of boring and I wanted it to be over. I kept reading because I wanted to know who the killer was. The killer was not at all who I suspected.I thought some moments in the story unbelievable. Why would the rest of the Dante Club keep secrets from G.W. Greene, if only for the convenience of suspense?So, the book loses momentum after the novelty of the situation wears off. Casual readers may enjoy this book, but I can't imagine true bibliophiles (especially fans of the Boston Brahmins) liking it."
2,Bog Down,"I got very bogged down in this book. Too many names being thrown around and the prose itself was overwrought and overly dramatic. Sometimes felt that Pearl was getting a bit carried away with his own genius. Great idea, but not brilliantly executed."
2,stodgy and boring,"i was really excited when this book came out because i'm intrigued both by dante (i've even made a pilgrimage to his house in florence) and by cambridge. when i started reading it, however, i was put off by the stiff prose, overdone, plodding description and tedious characters. the author manages to take the very gruesome subjects of dante's descent into the inferno and a serial murderer in 19th century cambridge and write a book that is downright boring. i really, really wanted to like this book, but i just couldn't. let me say that i am an avid reader -- i'm willing to put up with a book that has a slow begninning and i almost always finish a book once i start it -- but i could not bring myself to read anymore of the dante club after the first 99 pages."
4,Entertaining but not fluff,"Unlike one reviewer who calls the premise of four well-known scholars solving crimes 'preposterous,' I found this plausible. Although a work of fiction, the use of historic figures is compelling.What I enjoyed most is that it is a very skillfully crafted mystery, with gruesome crimes committed with The Inferno as inspiration. The revelations become more and more interesting.This is a nuanced look at artists like Longfellow and Holmes, complete with their acheiments and foibles. The characters are superbly drawn, including the murderer. Longfellow's sorrow and Holmes' interactions with his son are brought up convincingly.A good read that is paced appropriately."
3,"Great historical look, disappointing ending","The detailed descriptions of Boston/Cambridge during the last century were terrific. Research shown all over this book, and rather than make it stilted or academic, it brought the book to life. The main characters were finely drawn with real believeable personalities and foibles. The setting was also great.The problem was in the minor characters. The main villian was thinly drawn and a disappointment. The other low life was too dismiss-able and vague. It's as if the book were written by one of the ""Brahman"" it purports to be about.Nice historical fiction, but a less than nice who-done-it."
5,Break your losing streak,"I had been having a bad run at the track, and was looking for something to head me in a new direction. Speed to Spare gave me insight to using the Beyers, as well as other things to note and ignore. The best advice was to look to a new race or a different track if after analyzing the info you still can't beat the favorite or use high odds horses in exotic bets. I finally made money again!"
4,A Good Read,Good information for the beginning handicapper. Should be read along with Len Ragozin's The Odds Must Be Crazy.
3,Still trying to slog through this one,"I only knew the very basics about Beyer speed figures before I bought this book and maybe that's where I went wrong. The talk of 'bouncing' and patterns and cycles seems to contradict itself at times. I'll probably finish reading it someday, but the fact that I've had it for months and am only halfway through tells me it will be a while."
5,Stephen King-Move Over,"I am a big Ted Dekker fan! ""Three"", ""Obsessed"" and now ""Showdown"" are great books! I also read ""Blink"", but it isn't one of my favorites. When I first started reading ""Showdown"", if I hadn't known better, I would have thought I was reading a Stephen King novel. This isn't a book for children or the faint of heart. As a previous reviewer said, I even thought, ""Christian fiction???"" However, this is a great book to show the struggle between good and evil. If you like suspence and horror novels, this is one to read!"
4,Pretty good...,"I was hoping for something along the lines of the lost series, or green, red, black and white. But it was still pretty good."
2,Sorry!,"I was determined to finish this book and I was looking for something that would make me like it -- I just plain did not like this book. However, I have read other stories by this author and did think they were great."
5,Ted Dekker best author,I have read a lot of books but this my favorite.Ted Dekker is my favorite author and he is a great writer
4,Totally unexpected story line.,"I almost threw the book down. The character was doing things that bothered my Christan thinking. Glad I stuck out out, pretty riveting and unexpected. Great comparison of what Jesus did for us."
1,Not Quite The Showdown I Expected,"I was really disappointed by this book. I agree with some of the other reviews that commented how this book was long on fiction but short on Christianity. I was surprised by how graphic this book turned out to be. The love of Christ can be shown in fiction without writing about such evil. Ted Dekker is one of my favorite fiction writers, but Showdown wasn't the book I had hoped it would be. Spiritual warfare is alive and real in 2006 throughout the world, but we're not going to learn how to fight in such battles from reading books like this one. Hopefully, we will be entertained by this book and not disgusted. I'm glad others have enjoyed this book."
2,Bad Fiction,While I have enjoyed Dekker's Martyr Song series I was sorely disappointed by this book. Leaving aside the dearth of solid Christian worldview the writing and the story was just plain...stupid. It really was. The worms? The good cop Thomas dancing? I almost died. Very disappointing. Keep it real Ted - at least a bit.
2,How could this book ever get a good review?!,"I got this book right after it came out and read it the same day I bought it. It was...to put it mildly..horrible. Several times throughout the book I thought I was going to have to make a run for the bathroom to empty the contents of my stomach. I kept on hoping that it would pick itself up and turn around until I reached the end and found that it would never be able to do so. When finished, I found that this book left me with a nauseated feeling and I could not read for close to 6 months for fear of something similar happening in another book. I do not recommend this book for anyone, especially people of the younger generation. What went wrong that Dekker's writing style changed so dramatically?!"
2,Christian fiction?,"I have read all but one of Ted DeKker's books - I was very disappointed in Showdown. I think that Decker is an excellent writer and story teller but this book was adolescent and contained tremendous amounts of gratuitous violence. I believe there are other ways to depict the battle between good and evil without hacking people up or ripping out their eyeballs. It was long on fiction and low on Christianity. Don't get me wrong, toward the end of the books I picked up the parallel between Samuel and Christ but it was quite a stretch. ""Books"" or no ""Books"" - no parent or guardian would let 13 year-old children make their own rules and then destroy themselves with those rules in the name of personal freedom. The rules were all about love and that point alone certainly didn't show any love at all."
1,How can anyone like this book??,"I've never written a review before, but feel compelled now to hopefully save someone else from wasting their time. I had read some of the reviews on this website before I read the book and wasn't too concerned about the violence it mentioned (I'm a 24 fan, how bad can it be?). It's not the violence, it's the gross, disgusting, twisted descriptions that left me feeling nauseous the whole way through the book. I loved BLESSED CHILD and A MAN CALLED BLESSED, but this? I'm so sorry I wasted my time. I'm reminded of how much I loved the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark, but then when I watched the 2nd (or was it the 3rd) where any suspense was completely overshadowed by grossness, I just don't get the draw? I highly recommend BLESSED CHILD and A MAN CALLED BLESSED, but don't waste your time on this unless you enjoy feeling sick to your stomach throughout a whole book."
2,"Disappointing, but at least it gives you a little closure...","If you love the Trilogy of the Circle (which I most definitely do), then you'll be thrilled to note that Showdown tracks down a loose thread from those books and is crafted around something that had been left unexplained. I admire his skill and courage to attempt it; but I wish he had taking a little more time on the story. I don't regret having read it. It may just be that I know that Ted Dekker can do better. He's more than capable of producing a magnificent thrill ride with profound spiritual meaning. In fact, he's done it more than once. Unfortunately, this work doesn't fall under that category. It's still entertaining enough to complete; but, on the whole, it's somewhat predictable and can seem a little drawn out. I'm the type to not leave anything unfinished, so I'm still glad I read it for the closure; but I wouldn't say that the work stands on its own."
4,"Good, but a little over the top","Incredible plot. Incredible writing. I am a huge Ted Dekker fan, but I cannot say I would recommend this one to anyone right away. It is a masterpiece to be sure, butI think Ted went a little too far. It is a bit too hardcore- graphic and at times, just plain needlessly gross. The point comes across very strongly at the end, I'll give him that much. For a new reader I would definitely recommend the Circle Trilogy over this one."
3,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of everything that Ted Dekker has ever written, and I was very excited to see that he was coming out with this book. However, I was slightly disappointed by Showdown compared to Dekker's other books. Althought I found this book to be a little bit slow when I was reading it, there were some interesting parallels. This book was even more unusual than Dekker's other books. If you are a new Dekker reader, don't start with Showdown. My recommendation would be to borrow a copy from a friend or the library before you invest in purchasing it yourself."
3,Not one of Dekker's best,"I've read almost all of Dekker's novels and can easily say _Showdown_ was not my favorite. Somewhere along the way it seems Dekker changed his writing style, and it has been to his detriment. _Showdown_ just fails to deliver as a well-crafted suspense novel. If you want great reading from Ted Dekker, pick up the Black, Red, White Trilogy, his best work to date, I believe."
3,Not Up To His Usual Standards,"I am a big fan of Ted Dekker. I have read many of his novels and have enjoyed them all immensely ... until this one.Although this has good sections, for the most part it is disjointed, contains lots of nonsensical scenes, and has lots of gratuitous violence. The story itself starts off ok, drags a lot in the middle, picks up a bit, and then is is a bit anticlimactic at the end.It has some tie ins to 'The Circle' trilogy that will not be picked up on easily by those who have not read that already.I generally give Mr. Dekker's books very high marks, but this is one that you might want to get at a used bookstore if at all."
4,Great Supernatural Thriller,"Dekker has the wonderful talent and ability to pull you into the scenes wherein you imagine yourself the character. I look forward to books in this genre; there are so few good ones. I started reading supernatural fiction (seemingly real) through Frank Peretti who writes only a few books. In searching for more of the same type, I was pleased to have found Dekker. Dekker gets better as he ages and writes more and more. I look forward to his books."
3,Should be for 15 -18 year olds,"Being a Frank Peretti reader, I had heard the reviews of Ted Dekker and have been looking forward to reading some of his books. I have been watching at the library and this is the first one that was not a sequel of a series that came available. The thought that kept running through my mind as I read it(It took me 3weeks because I could only stand so much at time) was that it seemed like it was written for adolescents. I would actually rate the age younger than 15-18, if it were not for the gore and violence."
3,"A Good ""Prequel""","What I appreciated mostly about this book is the answers to questions raised in some of the other books. The story does grab you and keeps you engaged, but I kept feeling sorry for the characters who didn't understand what was being done to them. It does have some very interesting twists and it definitely keeps you guessing, but I felt there needed to be some sort of explanation or resolution given to the citizens of Paradise part of the story at the conclusion. The monastary side of the story was very good and gave insights to things in other Ted Dekker books. So if you are a Ted Dekker fan, this is a must read as it fits in with several of his other books."
4,"Better than ""Obsessed"" but not as good as ""Three""","This book is a step in the right direction for Ted. While his trilogy was a little fluffed in the middle and ""Obsessed"" fizzled out rather than ended, ""Showdown"" is a step back to the fine form we saw in ""Three"". The story is tight and moves along quickly. We're also introduced to some great characters (including one from the trilogy). This is not your average Christian novel, choosing instead to go the way of a great Dean Koontz novel. The concept is intriguing and I think it's perfect for a writer to do (you'll understand what I'm talking about when you read it). While this one isn't as good as ""Three"" (the plot twist ending to that one will be hard to ever beat), it's much tighter than ""Obsessed"" and hopefully is a sign of great things to come in future novels."
5,Hands Down the Best Dekker Novel Yet,"I was lucky enough to get my hands on an advanced readers copy of this novel and I must say... What a treat! This blows away any single book I've read in many a year. The plot is frightening in parts, very atmospheric through out, and kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. But like all of Dekker's novels, Showdown is oh so redemptive.The story is about small town that is ravaged by evil in the most suprising ways, but not nearly as suprising as the source behind that evil and the price it ultimately extracts from the town. I can't say more without ruining the twists the follow.This is definately a notch up for Dekker -- a big, mind blowing story that could very well be a water shed for the genre. Guarenteed to make you pace the carpet and lose sleep."
4,Think you can hit a curve ball from Ted? Think again.,"I've got to say, this is one of my favorites that I've read of Ted's work. Even after reading carefully and knowing that Ted was going to throw in some curve balls, I still missed them! I was reading every chapter looking for the curve...I knew it was in his arsenal...I knew it would be coming...I thought I understood the characters...Then Ted started his windup...I continued to read very, very carefully...and he let the pitch go...I watched it leave his hand and thought I had my eye on the ball...Then *WHIFF* I wasn't even close!Great stuff, even when you think you can hit his curve ball. Can't wait for Skin."
4,Showdown,I liked this book but not as much as I have liked his books in the past. I thought the book was a little slow but really enjoyed the end. It mirrored the love of Christ for his people and the showed the evil that is all of us if we let it blossom. I would recommend this book but did find it a little slow.
2,Gilgamesh the King,"I was under the impression that I was buying a novel, instead I received a children's story of Gilgamesh the King. The 11 page book is filled with a beautiful story as well as wonderful pictures that children would like. I don't have any children nor do I know of any that would like this book. In that, I am sorry. I will not be returning it as it would cost me more money and I don't want to spend any more than I already have. I would like to have known this when I was purchasing it. I gave it two stars for my disappointment and I will give it 5 stars for age appropriate."
4,Beautiful pictures; a way to discuss death with children,"The three books in this series, Gilgamesh the King, The Revenge of Ishtar, and The Last Quest of Gilgamesh, are easily the most beautifully illustrated version of the Gilgamesh story available. (To get the entire story, you must have all three.) I was disappointed that these books were ignored by my library patrons. Apparently the story of Gilgamesh is not well-enough known to generate popular demand. However, anyone who knows and loves the story of Gilgamesh should see (and own) these books. Parents looking for a way to raise serious questions about death with their children, but who are put off by such syrupy books as The Tenth Good Thing About Barney, might consider these books as an alternative."
5,Wonderful!,"Gilgamesh the King, The Return of Ishtar, and The Last Quest of Gilgamesh are exceedingly well-written and show many different themes and life lessons. The themes of friendship, revenge, good vs. evil, ambition, and immortality. But I think the most essential, underlying message is about love. Enkidu shows love to Shamhat and Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh shows love to Enkidu and his city, Shamhat shows love to Enkidu, and the city shows love to Gilgamesh, Enkidu and Shamhat! Love is woven into the theme of eternal life. I think these stories would be fabulous for anybody but recommended for 5-12. I am in middle school and we are reading these stories in class. I enjoyed these stories tremendously. So if you want to teach your children about death or love or friendship, these would be the ultimate choice."
5,One of Silverberg's best.,"An entertaining spin on the myth of Gilgamesh, by one of our foremost living authors. I have read the original (or a translation, anyway) and it is remarkable how he manages to be so faithful to the tone of the book and yet to shore up an often-fragmentary narrative. Definitely, a must-read."
5,THIS MUSIC MAKES ME FLOAT,"Of Bach's twenty kids, CPE was no slouch, musically, and had quite a romantic bent. These Sonatas for Flute and Harpsichord, as recorded on this CD, will whisk you away. I say ""as recorded on this CD"" for a good reason: the sound quality is so... ethereal... that it simply mesmerizes and transports one. The music, not at all staid in the standard baroque manner, is quite forward-looking and warm. It's sunny for a beautiful day, or, just as readily, ruminative and perfect for kicking back during an afternoon rain. Ah, the glories of CPE's music! And the melodies. And the sound Naxos gives us in this beautiful recording.... all to revel in. For the little money it takes to feel THIS good, this is a simple, affordable pleasure. Cripes! Life's hard enough as it is.[Running time: 68:34]"
4,Good set for a student,This is a decent tabla set for an aspiring player. Very well made and good sounding. Why not 5 stars? 5-star set will cost you 5-times as much :)
1,The urinal,I wish it was flat on the freeking bottom so I could sit it down without it falling overThanksKeith Powell
5,what a great idea,"I think this is a great book for introducing young kids to astronomy. I bought it for my 4 year old son at the bookstore and caome online to order their other books .... It's a very hands on type of book with about 18 easy activities to do with your kid. And it comes with a page of stickers which you place on the activity page after you complete that activity. It's as basic as you can get which makes it easy to understand. It covers time, clouds, rainbows, moon, planets, stars. Really a great idea."
3,Fishy Taste but price is right!!,"I have reservations about this fish oil, as it does have a fishy taste. As research claims, if fish oil has a fishy taste, it may not be as pure as the company says it is. I haven't experienced much of a noticable benefit, but the price is right!"
2,Taste,I am not happy witht he constant burping of the fish oil. I tried refrigerating it a s directed and that did not help either. It di cause some discomfort with my being able to digest it.
4,Gentle Charm,"Being a fan of Mick Harvey, a gentle, charming and extremely talented man, for over 20 years, I had no hesitation in buying this CD when it was first released. It merges Mick's musicianship and production skills with the beautiful, often cynical, humorous and emotive songs of Serge Gainsbourg. And with this recording, Mick owns these songs, reinventing himself while honouring the memory of the composer. I am currently living away from home and missed this CD so have just bought it again.Any fan of the Bad Seeds should discover Mick Harvery's side and solo projects - you won't regret it."
5,The Spirit of Serge Lives,Stumbled across MP3s for this today and immediately bought the album. This is perhaps the best collection of Gainsbourg covers I have found - and to find them in English is a neat twist. Serge would have wanted it this way.
5,Intoxicated Man,Mick Harvey's exploring great Serge Gainsbourg. Great covers. Anita Laine is helping.
5,"One of the Best, Sexiest Records Ever","It's one of those records with brilliance. A perfect, non-pretentious, adventurous, engaging, honest piece of work. You think Nick Cave is good... I bet he's (mick) the Keith Richards, the musical genius in the band. The chemistry with Anita is great. I have been giving it as a present to friends. It's also an aphrodisiac, as one is not reminded of Gainsbourg's sour looks, Mick has a really sexy voice. Get it and live a fuller life!"
4,Some installations problems.,The mount doesn't work in a Toyota Land Cruiser and the same in a Land Rover series. The quality is great but the back part adjust to the wheel doesn't have a
1,Design defect,"Imagine my surprise one day when the handle broke and dumped a bucket's worth of water onto the bathroom floor. The handle broke at the elbow. Upon inspecting my 3 other identical buckets, I found them to be stressed to varying degrees at the same location. A 2nd bucket handle soon failed. I contacted the manufacturer and all they did was offer to help me find a store locally that sold the same bucket. No thanks! I bought two Rubbermaid Rough necks with metal handles instead."
4,Engaging story,"Engaging story about an Indian merchant in Africa. Provides important insights into the effects of colonialization and modernization, daily life for Africans, and the mind of a unique individual."
3,"Difficult to read, but excellent","I read this book for a book club that I am involved in and I must say that I did not want to. I had heard and read a few things about him and his speeches/opinions that I did not like. Regardless, I read this book. All through reading, I was mad, upset, negative, and in general felt the book was just mean in spirit. I went to my book club to unleash this negative energy on the person that had us read it, but ended up keeping my mouth shut. Interesting idea that an author might want to inspire such feelings to drive a point home. After talking about it for a couple of hours and listening to other points of view, I found that this book did its job well. It is well written and fantastic imagery, it makes you mad, frustrated, and that is the point. A hard topic to read and a hard piece of history to swallow, but needed to understand the state of affairs in Africa.Opening my eyes to this makes me respect the author for doing a great job."
5,Old is Gold,"This is a very well written book exploring life of an non-african in torn Africa of some years ago. Basically the book revolves around the main character. But the most beautiful part of this book is its subtle humor and ironies of those times. Also, the situations in the book appear very truthful and close to those of developing countries. The book is a simple read and yet very rich in literature. The author has a very distinct writing style and one can also tell that the book was written long time ago. I found the book slow and boring at times."
3,ho-hum,"I'd looked forward to reading this novel for a while, and was mildly disappointed when I finally got around to it. Although Naipaul's skill is impressive, the book lacks heart, with the exception of the Yvette portion in the middle and the powerful events of the end. Salim's one violent episode is inconsistent and hard to swallow, as is Yvette's reaction to it. I wanted to care more about the characters; I found myself enjoying 20 pages, and then being bored by the next 20. To me, Naipaul's Half A Life is a better read."
4,Imaginative and observant,"This is the story of an Indian merchant's triumphs and failures, both business and personal, in a river port town in an unnamed African country. It is also the story of the town itself, and of Africa's struggle with itself and with outsiders.I listened to the unabridged audio, and look forward to reading the actual book some day when I'm not on the road so much."
3,Failed to captivate,Ever since reading The Poisonwood Bible I have been interested in semi-fictional accounts of life in post-colonial towns so I was looking forward to reading this book but I was left unexcited and glad to finally finish. The story started well but very little action followed and my mind began to wander. I did enjoy the sections which described the characters experiences of ex-pat life in London but the rest failed to captivate me and I was left unsure how I felt about the main character.
4,A vivid and personal portrayal of Third World development,"This beautifully written novel attempts to describe the lasting effects of colonialism on a small (unnamed) African republic, as experienced by an outsider who owns a small shop in a small village at a bend in the river. As African's take control of colonial governmental structures, political changes are reflected in significant changes in the narrator and in the village itself. The theme of isolation - as a non-African in Africa, as a villager cut off from the norms of ""civilization,"" and as an individual - resonates thoughout the novel, and in the end the question of who, if anyone, should govern, remains unanswered. Mr. Naipaul effectively intertwines a tale of personal development with a story of the struggles of developing nations in the Third World to produce a quite compelling novel"
3,Mixed Reaction,I found much of this novel to be evocative of not only the lives of people in an isolated part of the third world during the volatile post-colonial period but the author infuses the narrative with an impending sense that some very bad thing is going to occur. The reader is pulled in by this increasing sense of slow building tension reflected not only in the actual lives of the characters but in what they hear from others about events going on tangentially around the city they inhabit along a river in Africa.Naipaul does well in drawing the lives of people displaced from their original homelands and contrasting them with those who seem more to belong to the atmosphere and place where the story is set.In the end I felt a bit cheated as the story gets sidetracked more than once and the somewhat abrupt end didn't feel commensurate with the buildup.
3,Pessimistic Africa...,"The first half is engaging, optimistic and full of potential. The second half is a slog, loses it's optimism and, takes too many side journeys that add nothing to the overall story.Overall this leaves a rather pessimistic view of Africa.Naipaul maintains location anonymity, giving a mildly Kafka-esque feel.Worth reading, although I preferredChinua Achebe's ""Things Fall Apart""."
4,Succeeds at giving us at least one perspective,"I've read a bunch of the reviews, so I'll try not to repeat much of anything. There wasn't so much of the narrative I was expecting/wanting, but that's ok, because eventually I realized what he was writing this for, and even though I grew up in Africa, I felt like he churned up all I knew and helped me consider some things in new ways. This is not all of Africa, but Naipaul doesn't see it that way, so he shouldn't be criticized for revealing only a sliver of the pie. I do believe it gives a comprehensive perspective--while there are many others, you do gain great insight into the one he shows us. He's just pessimistic, and that may be hard for some to get past, but the truth is that plenty of people think the way his characters do, and I think that a lot can be learned from wading through his novel. And remember--don't assume a writer's views are exactly what he writes down."
3,A Bend in the River=Zimbabwe,"Naipaul's book, about an Indian merchant in an African country that's political situation is slowly and implacably worsening, reminds one of the current situation in Zimbabwe: Race baiting, colonial guilt, inept leaders - like many of Naipaul's books, it's all here. Naipaul's topic runs close to the grain of the uncomfortable topics that sometimes lead to accusations of racism, a label that Naipaul has suffered. If he appears to be without sympathy for the state of many post-colonial societies (especially post-colonial African societies), he has great sympathy for the individuals in those places, not just those who were colonized, but those who did the colonizing too. The comic aspects of Naipaul's writing (of which there is precious little in ""A Bend of the River"") belie the deep rift that is the legacy of European colonization."
4,The River is the Only Continuity in the Story,"I must admit to start that I was most enamored with the first half of the book, and then it tailed off towards the end. This dissatisfaction keeps me from acclaiming it as a masterpiece. Still the language, the imagery, and the mood the author invokes were a rare treat - and in many ways do remind me of the book its often compared to Conrad's Heart of Darkness.Naipaul's book does not put forth a blinding new truth, but rather it works on the familiar story of modern man living in a fallen world, but it manages to bring to the subject a new and compelling angle. It's worth reading just for the feel of being transported to an oppressive, hot, and constantly hostile and alien environment.Given the current events in Mozambique, it seems that there is nothing new under the sun - and Naipaul's book sadly has current relevance."
3,Interesting but not engaging,"I read this book after having read ""Acts of Faith"" by Phillip Caputo, which is about modern day Sudan and the conficts between so many factions. Someone reviewing that book recommended this one and indeed it provides yet another look at the same problems. This book was written in 1979 and portrays post-colonial Africa; Caputo's book written in 2005 shows that situation has only gotten worse.I had to force myself to finish this book, but when I did, I was glad. It was as if it didn't quite come together until the end. The ending was so visual, dramatic and well-written, it made the effort of reading worthwhile.I agree with many reviewers that they are some events that are just difficult to figure out. Salim's beating of Yvette is one case in point; I just didn't get it.I know Naipaul is an excellent writer and one that I will explore more of; however, he isn't easy."
2,"My first, and perhaps my last, Naipaul","Salim travels and returns to the city at the bend in the river. He ignores the good advice of those who have lived there and moved on, he ignores the clear signs that he should cut his losses and get out. He seems detached from everyone, even his mentor, even his lover. In the process, a different perspective of a developing African state is revealed to the reader. One senses the hopelessness conveyed by Salim's passionless actions, a habit of his Muslim family ancestry, who do not change with the times. His relationship with Metty, his servant, seems mutually condescending as is their tradition. His relationship with Ferdinand, the son of one of his most intriguing trading customers, is ultimately and unpredictably uplifitng. So there is much to learn from this novel, if not much to enjoy."
3,A Bend in the River,"The book made grand statements about modern Africa and the human condition by an important and talented writer. It's structure seemed to lack cohesion, though. I particularly didn't understand Salim's relationships with the women, particularly Yvette. His brutal beating of her seemed inexplicable.Salim's other relationships were excellently rendered, particularly Mahesh and his wife, Metty, Ferdinand, and Indar. Each contributed to the explanation of his isolation."
3,"Nice, But It Should Have Been Better!",V.S. Naipaul's opening scenes of East Africa and his picturesque writings of life near the Falls falters at mid book and never adequately matures.
3,A Good Bargain,"The price is right for this well-indexed, well-organized reference. It boasts 3,000 entries and all are in a logical context. The print is adequately sized and the margins are wide. There are no annotations, which would have been helpful.My problem with the book is the selection of quotes. Many famous quotes do not appear, and some very obscure ones do. It could be the authors wanted to stay off the beaten track, and draw attention to the less familiar. The result is quotes you don't particularly want to quote. It seems as if a computerized word-search was done, and this was the outcome.Surprisingly, there are not too many Shakespearian Quotation Dictionaries available. If you wish to have such a reference, you will not find many alternatives. I would give Arden's a lukewarm recommendation in that it could fulfill a need, and there are not many choices."
3,"Puccini: Manon Lescaut / Guleghina, Cura, Gallo; Muti","Puccini: Manon Lescaut / Guleghina, Cura, Gallo; Muti is a Deutsche Grammophon recorded live from Teatro La Scalla and starring José Cura and Maria Guleghina. First of all I am not huge fan of Cura as his vocals can tend to get a bit wild and uncontrolled. The booklet contains all the lyrics and also contains well-written music notes. As for the performance of Guleghina, my impression is that she does it well enough but nothing note worthy. A decent recording that I give a 3 out of 5. 3/5."
2,Good music but too much voice over commentary,The music is very good but this cd introduces many of the best songs with weird voice over. It is really annoying. I just want to listen to some good music. Buy another cd.
3,NOT AS GOOD AS ''ONE STEP CLOSER'',"THIS SONG IS OK. BUT, IT'S NOT REALLY THE KIND OF SONG YOU'D LISTEN TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE SONG HAS GOOD VOCALS BY SHINODA & CHESTER, AND IT HAS COOL GUITAR WORK. IT'S AN OK SONG FOR THOSE WHO LIKE LINKIN PARK. THIS IS ANOTHER SONG OFF OF THE BAND'S DEBUT ALBUM ''HYBRID THEORY''."
2,boring,"the tecnique is perfect, but I found it very boring. from the first to the last page all is the same."
4,two time,i order two time this book because the first time it beat. and amazon refund me the money. thanks.
4,Wishing it had some text!,"It's a good book, But it doesn't have any Text Whatsoever, Apart from that, It's Good!"
2,Not a whole lot of good things to say,"To begin, this book is poorly printed. The images are washed out and the intended high-key feel gets run over by flat reproductions. This book is a fashion photograpgher's attempt to show potential clients that he can get a book published and has seen lots of famous models naked. It is not art but strictly commerce. The photos are not that good. There is no deeper concept working here. I found myself flipping through the book waiting for something to catch my eye. The only interesting thing about this book is... There are great books on this subject matter out there. Don't let the minimalist italian design fool you into thinking this is one of them. This is the iceberg lettuce of the fashion/nude photo books."
3,"Elegant but cold,innovative but repetetive.","Elegant but cold.Innovative but repetetive.I've been waiting for this book to get published for two years.Finally,I am holding it in my hands.Somehow I can't help but feeling dissapointed.Roversi was obviously trying to show the fragile,soft and very intimate side of his young models.However,all of them are presented in exactly the same manner.Yes, Roversi's idea of creating transparent,soft almost ghost-like image of a female is nice,and yes it works beautifully with tall,thin boy -like women.But by the end of the book i could not help but feeling that I have been looking at the collection of female shapes,which look like pattern because of the identical technique and composition. Don't let me put you off,even if this book won't blow your mind it's still a wonderful example of taste and style.However ,those of you who have seen Roversi's work for italian Vogue will know that this extremely tallented artist is capable of much more."
2,Pretty but lame or pretty lame?,"I waited almost two years for this book to come out. I purchased it as a christmas present to myself, at first look I was gravely disappointed. I held out to write a review because I wasn't sure if it was the wait I didn't like or the book. Well two months later I can tell you it was the book. The theme gets really old really quick. After you look at one photo there isn't much sense in turning the page, beacuse the next photo looks the exact same! An uninterested model standing nude with the camera set on over expose. Big Deal. I would like to add that it is a beautifully bound book. I wish some of my other books were as nicely assembled. I'm going to assume that is were most of the cost comes from."
2,Look elsewhere,"This case, even as cheap as it is, is not worth the money. I use it with my Nano when mowing. I wanted something to keep the dirt off and out of it. When the case stays together it works well. The problem is it falls apart constantly. I almost lost the back when it fell off mowing. I would have been better off with a silicon or some other type case."
1,ish,"this book sucks. it's 10 chapters of the same thing over and over again. the author keeps repeating himself. not only that, he just keeps repeating his opinions over and over again. don't buy this book. i tell you, don't buy this book. you'll regret it."
2,"Great function, but not very durable","I've owned this mouse for about two years and have used it in a clean office environment. I liked the fact that it was very light, fit comfortably in my hand and had a good ""click"" feel. Unfortunately, it started acting very erratically yesterday. To be sure it was the mouse, I swapped it with another computer mouse. My computer resumed working fine and the mouse made the other computer behave erratically. So, I wouldn't say this mouse is such a great value..."
3,"lovely chair, but electronics not good","Nice looking chair. Very soft and very girly. My 2 mo daughter likes the elephant mobile, but the music and mobile aren't working after I changed the batteries. The motor is very sensitive. We had to exchange the first one we bought because the electronics didn't work at all, and now this one seems to be having an issue I haven't been able to fix yet."
1,Do NOT buy this product!!,"I ignored negative reviews on this seat and bought it anyway, thinking that possibly the negative reviews were wrong. Unfortunately, the negative reviews were right on!! The seat itself was comfortable and pleasant to look at, but I found it somewhat difficult to put together and musical part broke the FIRST day I had it! If you just want a bouncer seat--fine, if you want it to perform the mechanical functions it purports--forget it! I got another seat that doesn't bounce, but converts into a toddler rocker and had super colorful hanging toys that my baby loved much, much more."
3,Not complete,"I bought these books thinking I could use them to supplement my existing knowlege of Microsoft Products so that I could take my certification tets and pass them on my first try. After taking three the three certification tests I have discovered that the exams test you on material that is not even mentioned in the book. When the exam is made up of as few as 35 questions, not being prepared for even one makes a big difference. I would recommend that people preparing for Microsoft certifications try the books from Microsoft Press instead."
2,Okay,"These a very good books with a lot of good info in them, but if you're expecting that reading this books cover to cover will help you pass the Microsoft exams thing again."
1,Paper Money,"I have read many of Follett's books, but this one was very slow andnot interesting. I would give it only l star. It was not worth the money.Ymelda De Vargas"
4,Good,Although this was the first book Follett had published I enjoyed it just as much as all the other books he's written. And I've read them all. One of my favorite authors.
2,Confusing at best,"If this were the first book I had ever read by Follett I would probably never read another. Luckily for me, I've read almost everything he has written before I stumbled upon this one. He is one of my favorite authors and even though I found this book confusing with its huge cast of poorly filled out characters and sketchy twists in the plot, I am not sorry that I read it for I learned what a remarkable distance Mr. Follett has travelled in his skill as an author. A true Follett fan should read it solely for that reason."
4,Fascinating clever,"I found this book a very easy and enjoyable read. There is no main character but the story holds your interest or at least it did mine. There are characters in this story that could be construed as bad guys but that would be like stating a wolf is a bad guy and a deer is good guy. Follett is a master of taking attributes that reside in men like greed, ego and lust and matching then against what some would consider weak or less than aggresive counterparts. This is not to say the less than aggressive are stupid, they are not, it is just their life is not dedicated to preying on others. I liked this book because it was a good story, it held my attention and it entertained me. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because most of Follett's other books are better. It's not fanasty, it's not historical, it's not about a hero in shining armor, it's about today and wicked scheming people. I recommend this book as a good E&E (escape and evasion) read."
3,Paper Money,I love Ken Follett. This first book was not one of his best but it was not to see the beginings of his work.
3,Worth reading,"This was written before the best selling Eye of the Needle back in 1976 and under a pseudonym. Follett considers it his best unsuccessful book. I consider it an interesting opportunity to see an early effort from a well known author. The story takes place in one day and involves about a half dozen people who have no idea how their lives are becoming interlinked by events. Were he to write the same story today, it would probably be tied together a bit differently and would be fleshed out a little more, but all the ingredients are there and if you have been a fan of this author, it is well worth your time to read this one."
1,What a MAJOR YAWN of DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Ken Follett won my heart as one of my favorite authors in PILLARS OF THE EARTH, and EYE OF THE NEEDLE. I was so intrigued, that I wanted to read one of his earliest novels. It was praised, by Follett..and he ponders in the introduction if he was ""TOO CLEVER"" in writing this book. NO WAY! Clever is not an adjective which comes to mind.. Taunted as a novel of international suspense and action...it was neither. It was flat. It was dull. It was booooring. It was fragmented. The characters did not make me care about them....and I didn't ""get it"" when it was finished. I knew what Ken Follett wanted me to ""get"", but I did not. It was was so trite, that it wasn't even a summer ""Take me Away"" type of novel. IT was a weak start...but thankgoodness Ken Follett has risen to the occasion.and become a better author."
1,Not his best work,"My least favorite Ken Follet until now, somewhat disapointed. Read all the others before you actually purchase this one, period."
5,SHALAMAR / WHISPERS GREATEST HITS,Two great groups - all their greatest hits on one CD - what more can I say!!!!
2,"Cats love it, but its not durable enough.",My cats LOVE these toys. I have bought a total of 4 of these. The very first one lasted the longest. The 2nd one did not last very long as the circle ball part area snapped off separately from the feathers...not in the part that is removable. Pretty much the feathers were no longer able to be attached to the stick. After these 2...I ordered another 2. I attached the 3rd one and it broke off in the same spot IMMEDIATELY. I havent used the 4th one but im not buying anymore of these. What a waste of money.
5,Feline stimulation and exercise,"My new kitten loves this toy, and being able to replace the feathers instead of buying a whole new wand makes it a bargain. I try to keep some extras around because the feathers are eventually destroyed."
1,Not good,Feathers were soooo hard & stiff.. My cat really was not interested in playing with it due to it's texture
1,Huge Zero Stars,This item is huge. If you do not have a baby lion I would definitely stay away from this product. I have a 17 pound cat and the chain and toy are way toooo large even for him. They would hurt his pretty little face if it hit him. Would send it back but would cost me more in postage that worth. Would not recommend this for a household cat.
2,Not a book of were-wolves,"I didn't notice when I bought this book that it is over 100 years old. The author does not treat were-wolves in the common sense, he dwells on berserkers and cannibels. Both subjects worthy of study but not werewolves. If you are really interested in Were-wolves, go elsewhere."
3,It's a bit confusing,"The writing style isn't very clear and, consequently, the book is less interesting than its subject matter should allow it to be. A big disappointment."
3,With a grain of salt,"This book is pretty typical Baring-Gould and it's free so I won't complain much about Kindle errors. It is a good idea to Google this author before you read one of his books, though. His scholarship could be sketchy sometimes. Since he was somewhat self-educated in the discipline of gathering myths and legends, I suppose that is to be expected."
4,The Best Mini Tote,"I received this bag at my baby shower. It is the bag I use most for my infant because it is small enough for running errands without the big cumbersome large bag yet accommodating for diapers, portable wipes, burp cloths, toiletries and a set of extra clothes. I really love the separate insulated bottle holder pocket. It conveniently holds 4-5 bottles. I can't even find this feature on some of the large bags."
3,Can't get past the smell,"of this gel peel. It is soft and smooth, but it has a very strong odor. I can hardly stand to use it much for this reason."
2,Deteriorated quickly,Initially was very satisfied but not any more. Loop through which the front strap goes is very cheap flimsy plastic. I have never tightened this strap since the start but the loop still broke - rendering the sandals useless. Avoid Propet!!
3,Elastic heel strap,"Did not keep the sandals. The heel strap was elastic and I did not like the pressure pushing my foot forward in the sandal with each step. I liked the quality and would have kept them if the back strap had been adjustable. The elastic string in the picture looks adjustable, but unfortunately it is only for looks and style."
4,Leather footbed takes getting used to.....,"I am new to the sandal thing. I own a pair of brown Rockports already, but needed a pair of black sandals, so I purchased these. They are very nice. Workmanship is good quality. My only issue is with the leather footbed. It's taking some getting used to, as I do not wear socks with my sandals. I believe that in time, the leather will wear and be fine, but for now, it feels a bit weird."
3,propet,I like this shoe brand but this one is a little tough to put on. The strap was a little chafing on my foot. I still plan on wearing them. al
2,Keep Walking....,"I have owned a pair of Propet Suft Walkers for about 5 years and love them, so much so that I decided I needed a new pair. Ordered these from Amazon - fulfilled by Elite Hero. Paid an extra $19 for expited shipping, and took over a week to get them. Once they arrived, they would not fit in that I've been wearing size 11 of the very same sandal for over 5 years, and the new pair, also size 11 was too small. Upon requesting the return, I was required to pay the shipping back to Elite Hero. The total shipping costs paid was about 1/2 the cost of the sandals.Lesson learned! Don't buy shoes/sandals from Amazon - use Zappos instead."
2,will not purchase more,"I purchased these for my brother, however i found it didn't last any longer then a cheap pair from discount store"
4,Good Value,"With EEE width, I have a tough time finding good fits so I was pleasantly surprised to find these at a competitive price."
5,Great sandals,I have never orderd any kind of shoes without seeing them in person first but since these turned out to be so high quality I will order another pair. Amazingly comfortable and light. They appear to be well built and rugged. And mine came with a great warantee. A great shoe.
3,not a 13,I have worn out my 13EEE Dunham sandals and decided to buy the less expensive Propet 13 EEE but they were much shorter than the Dunham 13 EEE so I returned them and ordered the more expensive Dunham sandal.
2,Not Nevados,"Bought these because they have the SAME upper styling as my beloved Nevados that were discontinued.The uppers are too stiff. The lowers have too little bounce. The upper is set a 1/4"" too far forward, so my heel is not supported by the bottom heel indent, and the instep support is off.The worst thing is they are not quite bad enough to return.Seems solidly built and grips well."
4,Fits a big foot well,My husband is very hard to fit at 15EEE. These fit him well. He wears them all summer. I just wish they were more durable. We have to buy a new pair each year.
4,sandals,very good--comfortable--good sandals for the $$$ they look better in photograph but i do recommend them--quick & efficient service-----------try FIT FLOPS they are made for comfort--not sure if amazon carries them
5,"VERY comfortable, well made sandals","I've owned a lot of Propet sneakers in the past, so felt comfortable about ordering these sandals for my husband. He LOVED them! They're easy to adjust and have a cushiony insole. Highly recommend. More manly looking than other sandals and you can't beat the comfort."
4,Very good sandal,"I'm very pleased with this sandal. For the money, it has a nice look and comfortable fit. I wanted a more classical look in the beginning, but after getting used to this different style rather quickly, I started liking it. I also like the fact that is has a slightly raised sole, since I don't like flat shoes or sandals."
1,Just a product catalog for Lyman,"I thought this was the Lyman Cast Bullet Handbook, but it wasn't. This turned out to just be basically a product catalog for Lyman! It does provide a very basic overview of reloading, but is in no way specific enough for any particular application.This was a waste of money."
2,Pleasant but disappointing,This recording is pleasant to listen to but hardly a masterwork of interpretation. The audio quality is good but not outstanding. The ensemble plays nicely with precision but no soul. There is a complete lack of mystery and awe which these pieces are capable of expressing.But the most serious deficiency is in the organ department. In fact there's almost none there. Mozart wasn't a pedestrian dabbler on the organ. He played to be heard and make an impression. There is a superb interpretation on an older American LP which really demonstrates the dark mystery that these pieces should command. Sorry I don't have the names available and it's been long out of print. What a shame.
1,Decided not to buy,"Based on the two reviewers comments on this book, I've decided not to buy it. I insist that Amazon or editor/author show inside the books (pictures)so we buyer have an idea of what we are paying for."
5,Inspiration and humor intertwined,"Fred Anderson's common sense approach to conquering his own struggle with his body weight, when he finally had enough of his own excuses and broke down the wall that stood between him and his goal, is a very enjoyable, easy read. Even removing the weight loss aspect of this book, one can apply Fred's no-nonsense approach to any goal that seems elusive and out of reach. In *From Chunk to Hunk* you'll find insights on weight loss, motivational rants, realness, and a glimpse inside Fred Anderson's day-to-day life. Somehow, Fred makes even the ordinary funny and entertaining. Great book!"
2,"Well written, but simplistic.","My criticism is that he makes losing all of that weight sound much to easy. Basically, he is saying that ""eat non-processed foods"", and you weight problem will take care of itself. There is not one month, in that whole book, where he does not lose weight. He touches briefly on exersize, but I don't think he really tells the reader how had he worked. This is more of a motivational book, than a weightloss book."
1,Anthony Robbins should be named honorary co-author,"This book isn't very good. While the author's large and rapid weight loss, using sensible food choices and exercise, is inspirational, he spends too much of the book simply parroting his favorite self help gurus - verbatim. If you're familiar with the work of Anthony Robbins in particular, you will find this distracting. I tossed the book aside in disgust after the first few chapters but eventually came back to it. There are some honest moments where he seems to actually write in his own voice about the physical and psychological anguish of obesity. But these moments didn't come often enough for me to be able to recommend this book."
5,NOT YOUR TYPICAL DIET BOOK,I love this book. Fred Anderson pumps you up to finally change your life. Diets don't work. You do. He takes your mind places where you probably haven't been before and gives you what I call *mind tools* to get there. I've read quite a bit of diet books that deal with the psychology of losing weight and this is definately the best. I think everyone will get something (if not a alot!) of positive stuff in this book to finally make a change. Thanks Fred.
5,Two thumbs up!,"A friend lent me her copy of this book. I took it, figuring I'd leave it on the shelf for a few weeks and then return it, telling her I'd read it. In a fit of boredom one night I picked it up, started reading it, and was instantly hooked. I'd expected it to be one of those formulaic ""This is what you eat, this is how you exercise"" books, but it wasn't at all. I loved reading the story of how Fred lost 171 pounds and I took away more inspiration than I ever would have expected. My friend wants her copy back, so I'm going to go buy my own right now!"
1,Chunk to Hunk Stunk,"Mr. Anderson's accomplishment is amazing; his book is atrocious. Pages of regurgitated pop psychology take what should be an amazing story and make it impersonal and tedious. Unless you are overweight and need encouragement, do not buy this book."
4,SLY COOPER: PRIMA'S OFFICIAL STRATEGY GUIDE,This strategy book helped my out a lot! I got a lot of power ups. The only thing wrong was that the poster was gone. I guess that's what I get for buying it used... :(
3,You Don't Need This,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of strategy guides, but really, you don't need this book. The game can be slightly frustrating at times, but you get the hang of it very quickly, and it's extremely straightforward. I don't fancy myself any kind of game master, and usually I can't find my way out of Level 1 without a guide. Honestly, if I could finish this game without help, then the average parrot can as well (okay, not really.) If you're having trouble with this game, I reccomend a nice cold glass of water and a short bike ride, not a strategy guide."
3,"An ok guide, for some things.","Ok, this guide is great if you want to find some items, but for getting through the game, it didn't help me much. I am STILL stuck on Two To Tango. I have no idea where to go in this one area and that darn fox will NOT let me pause to figure it out! I recommend this guide if you need the clue bottles or want the AWESOME poster that comes with it."
2,Anthony Burns rocked my world,"My overall view of this book, Anthony Burns, is that it is very slow. It was a good story about freedom and rights, but it could have been fifty-pages shorter. During the last four chapters it talked about Anthony and his court trial. Every chapter seemed the same which lost my interest quickly. I also think the book had to many characters. I could never keep track of which person the author was talking about. I think Anthony Burns' story is a good one, but I don't think it was written very well. For example, every chapter was a different season and it would skip years. Anthony Burns had a very inspiring life, fighting for freedom and being traded from master to master; however, the overall story was just not very interesting. My opinion of this book is that it is a good book about a man's fight for freedom, but it was too slow and slightly confusing. I think this book would appeal more to adults or history teachers."
3,Anthony Burns a slave story,"If you are looking for a good book about historical non-fiction book about a slave name Anthiny Burns, I would have to say this books for you! I thought that Anthony Burns: The defeat and trumph of a fugitive slave was a so-so book. I didn't like how the book moved from time to time but other than that it had a good plot. The book is about a slave named Anthony Burns who gets captured and goes on trial and if you want to know any more you should buy this book!"
4,Anthony Burns,"Anthony Burns: The Defeat and Triumph of a Fugitive Slave (Laurel-leaf books). I'm fairly well educated on the slave issue in early America. I was not familiar at all with the unbelievable story of Anthony Burns. If it had been fiction, it would have been hard to believe! Wonderful true store!"
5,Parent's ignorance,"This is excellent, what I expected, and I recommend it to everyone. Modern eating trends are bad for one's health, and most people are ignorant of the fact. Kids will understand it, my 6 year old daughter has watched it several times over and it is clear that she understands the message they are trying to convey."
5,Easy install,"Fits in OEM location, but a lot smaller around. Grind off old bolts and use new ones. Sounds like the original. Recomme.nded"
5,great cd-rom,"I used this product to conduct a telemarketing campaign. Out of 500 calls I made, I got 15 bad numbers. This was very impressive. Most lists I have used in the past are not this accurate. I had good success. I would use them again."
4,"Good size, so-so construction and layout","I really like the size, although I can see how people with bigger hands may find it difficult to type with.The build quality could be a bit better. Some keys squeak when you type them, and the keyboard can bend easily.I would've preferred to have ctrl/alt keys on the right of the spacebar, but it's not a deal-killer for me.Overall, I think this is a good keyboard for occasional use. Perfect for my carpc project, since I can stash it away on my glove compartment."
3,key broke off and couldn't place back,"I loved the keyboard and its been a life saver since I use my laptop to see customers. I didn't want the customers to touch my laptop keys so I bought this mini keyboard along with a mini mouse. It worked great until today when I reached into my bag to pull it out and found the ""E"" key missing. I found it in the bag but when I tried to place it back on the keypad it didn't work. I'm really disappointed because I liked the keyboard and really need it for my job."
5,Wonderful!,"Great product, and though shipping seemed to be a lot, it was extremely fast shipping and the packaging was the best quality I've ever seen! So, don't get taken back by the shipping...it's worth it!"
4,Globe Review,"We think it is fabulous that you can be as creative as possible, but would like to have music."
2,Very Disappointed,The rubber gasket was too big and too firm to slide into the position as described in the directions. My figurine broke (two beautiful crystal butterflies) and the base started to have tiny cracks with the gasket in place. I ended up having to turn it into a glass display globe for one butterfly instead a snow globe. I intended to give it to a friend from Thailand who rarely saw snow. Snow is her most favorite thing on the planet. I was hoping to capture her favorite thing. I was very disappointed. :(
3,"Looks great, but didn't work for me at all.","The wood base looks really classy, and the seller was really helpful & prompt with expedited shipping. Unfortunately, the globe didn't work for my project at all. I needed to adhere a polymer clay figure painted with acrylic to the rubber gasket then fill it with water and ""snow"". I did a TON of research on snow globes, but still had issues getting the adhesive to work since the gasket was rubber. I finally got it to hold, but didn't trust the whole thing enough to add the liquid mixture, so I went with a waterless snow globe. It looks ok, but not at all what I had intended. I honestly would've had better luck making a snow globe myself out of a jar or something. I suppose if you have a lot of time and more experience this may work great (as it does look pretty), but as a first-time snow globe assembler, it failed for me. I definitely won't be trying something like this again if I can help it."
2,NOT RECOMMENDED,"This item was a disappointment from day one.It lasted about 3 weeks before it broke.I had hoped it would be a good gift,but not so in this instance."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this snow globe as a present for my sister-in-law. When I received it, it looked very nice. It is a good size snow globe with a nice wooden base and rubber plug. You are supposed to glue the figure to the plug, however when you do this, it makes it impossible to put the plug into the glass globe. The instructions suggest you place the plug in the freezer once you're ready to complete the snow globe, however this doesn't shrink the plug enough to insert it into the globe without bending it so much the figure that you glued onto the plug starts to break off. I ended up just gluing the figure to the plug and gluing the plug to the base and forgetting about the glass globe. It's now just a figurine that can sit on a shelf instead of a snow globe."
1,"Missing Parts, No Instructions...",This arrived with missing parts and no instructions and is completely unusable. It was also poorly packaged and a complete waste of money.
4,Sizes are inaccurate,"I just got these and I could tell just by looking at them that the sizes were inaccurate. The 2 tsp. scoop actually holds 1 level tablespoon. The 1 tablespoon scoop holds 1 1/2 tablespoons, and the 2 tablespoon scoop actually holds 3 tablespoons. This won't be a problem with most people but for some people who might be running a catering business and are concerned with things like cost and portion control it could be. The scoops themselves are well made and can probably handle the stiffest of cookie doughs. The action on the largest scoop isn't as smooth as the other two but I probably won't use it very often anyway. I'd use it as an ice cream scoop if I didn't already have one.UPDATE: I've noticed that since this review was published that Amazon has updated the description of the item to show the accurate sizes."
4,Poor Labeling,"These things are good for scooping and dishing approximate sizes and volumes, but as a previous reviewer noted, they are not accurate enough for measuring baking ingredients. Still the volumes quoted on Amazon are not quite right, as the larger two are not a 3T and 1.5T disher, but rather a #24 disher and a #50 disher which are supposed to hold 2.67T and 1.28T respectively. My biggest problem with the set is that the smallest one, which is about 35mm and I'm guessing is a #60 or a #70 isn't labeled at all.Update: According to Norpro's website the smallest scoop, Item Number 676 is a #70, which they claim is 1Tbs, but should actually be about .91 Tbs. Again, not good enough for measuring, and mine still isn't labled."
4,"Work great, but wish they had nice clear labels","We've been using these for quite a while now without problems. We just refer to them by 'big', 'medium' and 'small' but I wish they were labeled with actual measurements."
4,Good for a few laughs,"Game has some decent scenes, good songs and colors. My three year old does ok on it - there's one particular scene where clicking on Bert and Ernie's faces changes their shape and my three year old belly-laughs to the point of falling off the chair. Good game if you can find it used at a discount.."
5,"If you don't get it, you never will...","But the Hitch-hiker's Guide is a story for those of us that have looked at the world and seen the joke, even if we're not exactly sure of the punchline. People that give this book less than five stars are the same sort of people that don't laugh at presidential candidates. (For those of you that don't know, if you want to research for the Earth Edition of the Guide, go to h2g2.com! It's hoopy!)"
4,loved it!!!,"This book was some time hard to follow, but in the end I loved every minute of it and never wanted it to end. I Loved to read Ford Perfect he made the book, The way he never listen to any one and stayed in his own little mind and talked to him self, I love him@!"
5,This book was always interesting and fun to read!,"This bool let you imagine and realy live the life of the characters. You realy get into it and can't put it down! -Not only is the hitch Hiker's series good the Two Dirk Gently books (The long Dark Tea-time of the soul, and Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective agencey)are realy good too! I suggest you buy & read them all!!"
4,IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE?,"Fascinating episode of the PBS series, ""The Astronomers"", ""Prospecting for Planets"" plays like a detective mystery as American astronomers search the universe for stars that may harbor a planet like Earth. Jarring, nearly poignant speech from one of the astronomers as he interprets astronomy to it's bare bones components of the minimal ingredients that make up the human DNA."
1,Vermin,"Anuradha Pal is a THIEF. I chose not to continue tabla lessons with her and she refused to give me my money back. She is VERMIN, Nasty and Money Hungry with no Ethics. Do NOT EVER Take classes with this Swine."
1,Not a quality item and response from company poor,"We received the toy box as a gift for our baby-to-be. On the Babies R Us website, this is the most expensive toy box and claims to be of quality construction. Pre-drilled holes do not line up correctly and cut-outs on back rest were damaged out of the new box. I definitely DO NOT recommend this item. Especially considering it was considerably more expensive than the other toy boxes. When I attempted to obtain replacement parts from P.J. Kids, I was advised that the replacement parts were unavailable and I could either try to get them from Babies R Us or get a refund from the store."
2,TOO EXPENSIVE !!!,THIS A VERY EXPENSIVE LITTLE FLASHLIGHT ! NOT WORTH THE $$$$.... WON'T BUY IT FOR THIS PRICE !! NO WAY ! BRING PRICE DOWN IN ORER TO SELL IT !!!
1,PANTS,"This CD shows that the band is void of any musical talent, and obviously requires tuition from a musical chimp !."
1,Very dull and not helpful,"This was the first book I ever read on running and after reading it I almost quit running and thought all running books were useless dribble. This book was very dull and had no substance to it. It was very hard to read and spent most of the focus on how you feel and how to rate your energy level during your run. It didn't have any structured plans or advice for training. Thankfully, I decided to read other books or I'd have never realized that there were people that actually gave useful and helpful information."
2,"Rednecks 'N Gore, Yeehaw!!!","I thought this movie was pretty boring, and the town was like Mayberry and Hazzard put together! There was too many rednecks and white trash, it seemed like a Rob Zombie film! I did love all the gore scenes. If you are a redneck and love gore, you might like TWO THOUSAND MANIACS!!!p.s. The South WON'T rise again!!!"
3,OKLAHOMA with a splat!,"After seeing H.G. Lewis's BLOOD FEAST, I was expecting something a little more funnier but I guess this 1964 hit ""in blood color"" still packs a punch.Connie Mason and her boyfriend (who she picked up on the way) is headin' for Texas; a place ruled by psychotic nuts who grind their visitors to ashes. There's finger chopping, decapitations and a lady who gets crushed by a rock.This film may be a little over-rated and it takes a while to get moving but still theres a certain charm (if thats the word) and after thinking for a while, it suddenly came to me that TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSECRE completely ripped this one off; the idea of Texas being a complete loony bin. This film played in the drive-in for over 26 years. Great music!"
2,not very good,"i got this movie cause i like 2001 maniacs, should have passed on this one, will be selling soon"
3,Blast From the Past,What a kick! I felt like I was 11 again and should have been at the drive in.... Thanks for the classic... Will do business again.
4,Not as gruesome as you'd expect,"This was the first movie I had seen by HG Lewis. There is pretty much no gore at all compared to his other movies. This one isn't very good, but it's entertaining. The remake is pretty funny too"
5,Great steak knives!,This is a quality product. The edge is sharp and will not need sharpening for a long time. I love the rosewood handles.
1,Great blade. The wood stinks!,"I've read that certain types of rosewood have a distinctive smell, but aside from the fretboard of my guitar, I've never owned anything made of the stuff.Fast forward to my purchase of these knives... they have a ""distinctive smell"" alright. If you're cleaning them and you get the handles even slightly wet, be prepared for a slightly-smoky, mostly-foul odor.The blades are great... usual victorinox quality. But unless this smell starts to fade over time (it's been 48 hours now since they dried completely) I can't imagine wanting to eat anywhere NEAR these knives again. Much less hold them close to/in contact with my food."
5,Knives cut thru steak as if it was butter!,Excellent price for the quality of these knives that cut thru steak as if it was butter. The knives came in a very flimsy box. Keep that in mind when you buy them - they should be kept in something so the blades don't become dull. Love them knives!
4,Cuts well; light in the hand,"These knives cut meat very well. I bought after recommendation in Cooks' Illustrated. They are a little light in the hand. Also, they are not serrated."
5,childhood favorite!!,"initially read this in 5th or 6th grade and i decided to try and rebuy the series so that the wife and son could read them. they both love the series and im hoping to eventually get all of the books together for my collection. little bit 'racier' than i remember, but nothing a middle school kid hasnt been exposed to. do yourself a favor, if your reading this, go ahead and click the buy button."
1,BEWARE!!!,"'Be Safe' WASN'T -- sorry, but this book did NOT measure up. Other reviewers -- most of whom appear to be friends/relatives of the author -- led me to believe this was a well-written, fast-paced and unpredictable mystery. Wrong! This book was formulaic and predictable to the point of nausea, suffered from terminally weak paragraph construction and cliche overkill, and had errors up the ying-yang. Definitely NOT a satisfying read, nor a book I'll pass on or recommend -- what it WAS, unfortunately, was a mistaken purchase based on inaccurate reviews. 'Be Safe' should be retitled 'BEWARE!'"
1,Do Not be Mislead By Those Other Good Reviews,"I was anxious to read this book based on the Amazon.com reviews. What an incredible disappointment. I only finished the book so that I would be able to write a review. The dialogue is very stilted. The characters are not very developed. And the plot... well, there's something there but the writer just can't seem to pull it all together. An avid reader of good fiction, I was very disappointed with this book."
5,voice of america,"it's a good book, especially for someone that really need an information about the history of the voice of america."
4,A mental exercise in quantum mechanics,"This is a mind bending romp into quantum mechanics on a cruise ship. It is also a story of how a woman who has always been a good girl decides to reenvent her life. If you like to take the occasional walk on the wild side in science fiction/ fantasy this is a good read for a cold, gray day."
3,Decent Camcorder with some incovenient features...,"I bought this for a homestay teacher exchange program to Japan, sponsored by Hitachi. As part of the agreement, we had to purchase a Hitachi digital camera/camcorder. Some of the technology was ""awkward"" and made it difficult to edit and produce a final product once I returned."
3,Ok unit,"I was in need of a DVD based camcorder and with most camcorders on the market today being flash memory or HDD based it came down to this unit or the Sony Handycam. The price was better on this unit with similar features to the Sony. The unit appears to be a refurb'ed unit. It functions fine, but the battery will not hold a charge for more than 10 min. Now I have to locate and purchase another battery. Other than that it is easy to use and the picture quality is good."
1,Poor quality,"I got thic DVD cam as a gift and am very unhappy about it. I wish I could return it. It has multiple problems like reading disks, finalizing disks, poor picture quality and so on. I would not reccomend it."
1,"Horrible, do not waster your money","Worst buy I ever made, here are some of the problems:-Cannot open disk to remove easily, takes a few minutes, sometimes does not open at all.-Constant issues with ""formatting disks""-Off button is not locked and often moves to ""on"" while transporting, when you take it out for use, battery is dead.-After capturing images, unable to play back due to ""corrupted disks"" even after disks have played fine many times previously.Don't waste your time with this item."
1,Beware of Hitachi DVDCams!!!,"I own a previous model Hitachi DVDCam. I have had several of my DVD's become corrupt and unreadable after I had recorded (and viewed) several videos on them. I called Hitachi and after a LONG phone call was basically told that I had bad luck and they were sorry. It is a porblem with the DVD itself and they do not stand behind the DVD's (because they are from a different manufacturer). My only option is to contact a data recovery service to get back my hours of lost video. Looks like that will cost me about $200-400 for two discs.I understand that they do not make the DVD's, but their cameras use them. If I can record my videos on to them, I should be able to see those videos again. The only way to use their DVDCams are to record onto DVD's! Save your money and frustration and don't risk losing your precious family memories!"
2,Disappointed in purchase,It stated that it was used but in good shape. When I received it the front and back cover was all bent up and worn and the pages were yellow from age. I did not consider this purchase to be as expected. All of my other used purchases were in very good shape and the pages were not yellowed like this one was. I was very disappointed.
5,Orientalism,"...Edward Said writes an important piece, revealing several important aspects of western thought. He proves that, even today, racism plays a dominant role in Westerner's perceptions and treatment of others. Said utilizes numerous literary, scholarly, and policy works to deconstruct Orientalism. These pieces aid comprehension and help to illustrate his complex issues. In addition, he exposes a logical and thought provoking argument that appeals to students and scholars in modern Middle Eastern Studies and a variety of other disciplines."
3,Great expose,I read this book knowing very little about Orientalism as an academic field. I thought the book was very much needed to expose the views the West has held and does hold about the Middle East. I really recommend this book for people who like hot topics and controversy.
2,I can see why people are buying this BUT....,"I can see why people are buying this now, following Said's sad and premature death, but the extreme way in which he used to put things (I remember he almost converted an audience I was in to support Israel by the time he had finished) is sad proof that he did not do the Palestinian cause in which he believed any good. (And I speak as one with many Palestinian friends and who is very much in favour of the pro-peace Palestinian cause). Saying that Jane Austen in Mansfield Park is an orientalist is complete rubbish! So read this book, but do so with your mind open. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)"
1,absolute rubbish,"It is interesting, as a brazilian, to realize Said's resentment resembles one of a similar kind which portraits Latin America as the victim of American Imperialism. Latin american intellectuals share the same hate, anger and paranoia towards US.This may be why to this day brazilian academics force this appaling book down their students throats.You dont need to be a clinical psychologist to figure this one out: a scape goat is a helpful tool to cope with one's own stupid decisions in life."
1,Irresponsible and Lacking Rigor,"Said's book has, sadly, been hugely influential on thousands of university students, their professors, and many living in the islamic world. His book should not be read without concurrently reading Ibn Warraq's critique _Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism_.Said lays the blame for nearly everything wrong in the islamic world at the feet of the West, and thus helped entrench the culture of victimhood that feeds into suicide bombings and riots against political cartoons. By authorin this book, Said confirmed his place in History as an irresponsible poseur in scholarly trappings."
2,False assesment,"Lets get the argument strait here: the Western scholars tried to understand Islam through tradition techniques like fact finding and cultural analysis and for Mr. Said this is not good enough and in fact racist. So basically this book claims that to understand and even critique is racist. The main theme is 'how dare the west critique'. Well isn't Mr. Said critiquing, maybe this book should realize its utter hypocrisy to say 'how dare you critique us' on the one hand while then critiquing the west on the other. according to this volume the great flaw in the west is that it dared to try to understand the east, well maybe it would be better if we just remained ignorant of it."
4,Good content but hard to read style,"Orientalism is a famous book that traces the origins of the defamation of the history of Islam by the colonial forces who invaded muslim countries during the previous century, to justify their invasion as a way to civilize the ""barbarian muslims"".The book is well documented and very important to read. The only problem I had was with the writing style of Ed. Said which I found hard to read."
2,good for only one song,"I don't like the original version of this song or the remixes. What makes this CD worth it is Erasure's live remake of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass."" This adds to their renditions of Abba, Judy Garland, and other camply classics. It also proves that Andy Bell can sing falsetto just as well as Debbie Harry, very entertaining."
5,Outstanding new author,"Once in a while you take a chance on an unknown writer and feel like you've hit pay dirt. In Peter Hyman, I did just that. I found a modern and original voice that relates experiences that could be taken straight from my life. And that voice needs to be heard. I constantly fight the battle of ESPN over a showing of Bocuse d'Or on the food network. I can talk about Mark McGwire and Marc Jacobs. I watched Sex and the City for the sole reason that Samantha Jones is a top biller in my sexual fantasies (I've tried replacement material, but she keeps showing up--sorry Cheryl Hines).This is a great young new author and I am eagerly awaiting the next installment. I finished this book in two days--apologies to the unwitting subway riders who had to endure my outbursts on the commute."
3,"Interesting and funny, but not 4 star literature!!!","I read this book for my book club. While I enjoyed it and was amused, I thought it was too full of pop culture references that would cause this book to be meaningless in a handful of years. Each essay was fine, but to read them one after another, was too much. I think the format of magazine articles or newspaper articles would have served this author much better. And I could glean no logic behind the order of the essays in the book, further emphasizing them as more suited to a series of articles rather than an actual book."
5,Funny and Witty,"This book is about a guy that lives in a ""Sex in the City"" world. It's quite funny that at times you forget they are real stories about Peter's life.It a quick page turner. A good recommendation for the beach or just in-between books."
3,"Hard to activate, battery died quickly.",We bought this for our then 2 year old who was in love with basketballs and the color orange. He thought it was pretty neat but wasn't able to activate the sound on his own. You really needed to slam it down to get it to make the cheering sound. The sound was a little rough - it didn't sound much like a cheering crowd - but more like just a loud noise. The battery also ran out pretty quickly and there is no way to change it so now it's just a basketball.
5,Very Enjoyable.,"I'm not sure there is one song I don't care for in this cd; really good tunes, and she sounds great"
4,1991 everything coloured& musical,when the cds replaced the albums in the 80s they still had some work to do to justify the buy here the magic brothers bring us great music /the only love 4example& lyrics in the artwork
5,Unbeatable Roman Trilogy,"This is my second recording of The Roman Trilogy by my favourite composer Ottorino Respighi. It is even preferable to my last one with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra. The sound quality is superior with a slight reverberation to the acoustic, which goes well with such atmospheric music. The brass playing is also terrific on this recording. Every time I listen to these masterpieces of orchestral colour something new is revealed, so I never tire of them. Rightly so, Gramophone magazine gave this recording a top recommendation when it was first released."

4,Good Humor,"What a hoot. Jeff Foxworthy has done it again. We enjoy reading to each other, with a redneck accent of course."
1,TOTEM,"totem (tot'um) v. and n. plural - Direct explanation of one's own narrative participation in a chain of events; at times, produces self-congratulatory patting oneself on the back for being able to state things correctly.As in:My friends asked what I thought about J.F.'s new book. I totem Redneck Definitions in short comedy bits on his TV show were funny, hilarious even. I totem as a book though it was mostly lame, down right dull all the way through. I totem it was a waste of their time and money. Some went ahead and bought it anyway. Only to return and say that I was right all along, from the first time out. All I can say to this is I totem so!Final analysis: Ho-hum. Not recommended."
