4,The Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity),"The Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity)Many people forget that this is another Marvel Character movie, but it is a very good testament to the character. Wesley Snipes does a powerfully good Blad, and I'm sure you'll enjoy these films."
5,Blade Trilogy,This is the compleat collection of the Blade movies. Buy this collection along with the TV show Blade - House of Chthon and you will have a prsent for all.
1,This is specificly for the box set.,"Let's see...You get all 3 dvds, and ...oh wait...nothing but the dvds. You can buy Blade 1 & 2 most anywhere in the civilized world for less than $10 each. So why are we being expected to shell out $50 for this box set? If you bought them all seperately you'd pay well under the $50 price tag of this boxset.If you're going to be duped out of your cash, you should at least get something cool for your troubles."
1,Garbage Movies,"Three movies with both bad scripts and poor bonus features, and we are expected to pay money for this. NO WAY."
4,Great Set for the money!,"I bought these new, played them with DTS sound on and loved em'. Blade 2+3 each have a bonus disc, and all of them come in widescreen format which i think is better cause you see more of what's going on. Has a pretty kewl box case that they all come in also."
5,"Ah, Wesley Snipes...","Always been a fan, now i have my own set to watch on those chilly or rainy days...Fast shipping and great value for price."
4,Sandy & Junior you are the best!,"I love this album, but I like the all English version album they just released in the Brazilian market better. I like the other version better because the Brazilian market version seems like the original intent. They should also release the all English album here. However, this English/Spanish/Spanlish/Portuguese album is still a must have for S&J fans."
3,I'm not sure what the purpose of this book is,"First, let me say that this book is well written and contains a lot of useful information about IPv6. It is targeted toward developers and technical people, and not really meant for the average person. That being said, I'm not sure why I bought this book. Everything you need to know is available on the internet for free. Wikipedia has a nice summary on IPv6 that should sum it up nicely for people who don't need to do a deep dive on the topic. If you're an engineer implementing IPv6, everything you need to know is available in the IETF specs. Just go online and download the relevant RFCs.So, if you're smart enough to know what IPv6 is, you should be smart enough to find all the info online and save yourself some money."
2,Not a very good book,"This is a very dry reading of the protocol specifications, and isn't easy to understand.After reading the first few chapters, I was very confused by several things that were never explained, so I read the related RFCs (i.e. RFC 2460 and 4291). I was surprised to find that the content in the book was nearly identical to the RFC. Many parts of the RFC were lifted WORD FOR WORD. I don't need to pay for a book that simply takes the RFC and prints it on paper. I can do that myself, FOR FREE.I thought this book would give an explanation and some examples to make the concepts easy to understand, but it doesn't. I regret buying this book."
4,Michel,"I loved the book, it present complex topics in simple words, it helped learn fast.for the price, this is a very nice deal"
3,Could have been better!,"The plot and characters are there but this book just lack depth. I was frustrated reading most parts as I felt Talylor could have developed them better. Maybe it is the editing, the sometimes deadpan dialogue and and lack of style. Or the writer is trying to tell too much in such a short story. However I will keep a look out for Taylor's future effort as he does show glimpses of a promising writer in certain scenes of Dinner Club, like the poignant moment shared by the members of Dinner Club when they could not even bring themselves to acknowledge the word ""Gay""."
2,Poor old Anakin Solo...,"First he's forever being confused with his grandfather, and now that Harry Potter kid comes along and does everything he does, only better! Seriously, this entire series should be re-edited into one or two books,without the endless background info-its safe to say that even most 8-year-olds reading this will have seen the movies"
4,Well worth it,"I'm a happy Guuuurl!! Hight recommended, not that 'quiet' though, but fun with a partner."
2,Very Narrow,I bought this shoe and had to return it because it was so narrow I couldn't get it on and I don't have a narrow foot!
4,NICE!,i bought this along with another watch as an early christmas present for my husband and he loved it. its a watch suited for him since he's a sporty-kind-of-guy. a little bit pricey though.
5,An indepth look into the Art of Advanced Japanese Acupunctur,Covers the entire spectrum of Acupuncture withemphasis on the latest discoveries in AdvancedJapanese Acupuncture. Excellent introductionon a vast number of treatment modalities. Teaches a workable method of Abdominal Palpitation for Channel Disturbance. Giveswonderful new scientific research on the possible workings of Acupuncture. Provides the non-needle practitioner with a workable and very powerful system which includes the use of Open Points.Dr. C Ledwell OM
1,not what I thought,"The only problem I found with this book is that it was apparently used, and I never would order a used book. I ordered the book, and was sure it was new. When I received it, it had writing all over it, and it was scribbled on and erased.I would never buy a used book under any circumstances, much less a religious book that I was going to give my granddaughter. I returned the book and received credit for it. The other book I ordered at the same time was new and came in great condition. That's what I expected from both of them."
2,Disappointed,"For a Nautica product, these pants are subpar. I own several cargos from Nautica bought locally, and when I saw these I thought what a great price! Bait and switch, the pants are 100% cotton, but think SHEER cotton. The picture does not do these pants justice. I don't think the picture above IS the same pants by any means. Functional, ya I can wear'em, but they are not what I thought I was getting. Booo"
3,not what I wanted,"These are made from very thin material. The description did not indicate that this was a summer weight pant. The pants that I purchased in their outlet stores was a thick, soft cotton."
1,item not as advertised,"This item was not a natural gas grill. It was a LP Gas Grill which means either you or I will be out the money to convert to Natural Gas. If I am out the cash, you will never recieve another order from me. I have contacted my natural gas provider for an idea on the cost to convert."
3,"If you bought any of his other books, don't bother...","This book deals with some really important points. Having read it after 'The Intuitive Trader' and 'The Inner Game of Trading', I found the points he makes in this book worthwhile, but repetitive of the other 2. I recommend 'The Inner ...if you were to buy only one."
1,Forget about this,"If you really believe that the Eastern philosophy of Tao/Taoism can enhance your success in trading, buy and read ""The way of the warrior trader, the financial risk taker's guide to samurai courage, confidence and discipline"" by Dr. Richard D.McCall. Dont waste your time and money on somebody who knows so little about Tao and just does copy and paste Chinese adages and his own old writings here and there.p.s. I had read Koppel's other books before and had rated them as two or three star stuff. I am so sorry that I had not disciplined myself enough to stop making another unnecessary loss for being attracted by the appealing title of the book. The good thing is: I borrowed this one from the library."
5,The Tao of Trading,"This is an excellent book. It almost reads like a poetry book for traders. It is not merely about the Tao...it unfolds and reveals ideas and insights like the Tao itself. This may sound somewhat strange but if you are interested in creativity and trading and its relationship to some of the great insights of the East the subject matter here will be found useful and worthwhile. Also, check out Mc Call and Steinhardt."
2,Beautiful looking book,"But did anyone else notice that the father was plucked completely out of the story? He appears on the very first page reading the newspaper, but that's it! He plays no role in the family's activities. hmmm. These aren't the Dick and Jane stories that I grew up with. In those stories the father was present and the family was complete. But that wasn't very PC was it?"
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,This is an absolutely wonderful book for now or the holidays. Would make a great gift for anyone who grew up with Dick and Jane and Spot....what a great memory from the past!
4,Read with ease,I purchased five Dick & Jane books for my six year old grand daughter. She was able to read them with ease. I know this will help her improve her current reading ability. They will also be a keepsake for years to come.RAB Sullivan County NY
5,Beautiful Christmas book,The book is nicely oversized. Very nice illustrations and colorful. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,review from a Bielski,"Being the son of Aron Bielski the youngest of the 12 Bielski children I must say Ms.Tec did a wonderful and accurate job.Since Defiance was published there has been a great amonut interset raised on the Bielski Brothers.The book is informative and suspensful, it tell stories previously only known to the family and members of The Bielski Brigrade."
3,A Choppy Delivery,"Nechama Tec's Defiance: The Bielski Partisans tells the fascinating story of the Bielski brothers, Byelorussian Jews who formed a partisan unit, and in the process saved over 1000 Jewish civilians. It is the largest ""rescue"" of Jews by Jews during the Second World War.Luckily, Tec has a fascinating story to recount. It carries the weight of her choppy, often inelegant prose. This is particularly the case in the first two chapters, where Tec inexplicably provides us with one or two sentence paragraphs. Luckily, this ends after forty pages or so; the reader should stick to the text and not succumb to this bizarre structure. Defiance tells a riveting story; even if the delivery is a bit choppy, this is still an important book."
2,Movie was better,"I rarely say this about a book, but the movie was better. The book is slow. The story is good, but the writing about it could have been better."
1,"Tough to get through, just watch the movie",Great story but poorly written. Normally i polish off a book or 2 a week and it took me a good 3 weeks to get through this one. forego the book and just watch the movie.
3,defience cd,i bought this book cd for my mother who is blind and i wanted her to at least be able to know what is being played at the movies
1,Interesting story that is poorly written,"The story is interesting but the writing style is very amateurish. When I started reading the book I was quickly disppointed by the choppy writing style and hoped that it would improve. Unfortunately the quality of the writing does not improve at all. One reviewer on Amazon said it sounded like a high school term paper and I think that was a ""kind"" assessment.It is not a good read."
2,A good true story poorly told,A great true story but not the greatest writing. There is way too much repetition. It also focused too much on the different social groupings of the otriad (fighters and food gatherers on the top and malbushes on the bottom of the food chain). The narrative was constantly interrupted with examples of the differences in the social groups and how those on the top were treated differently. I got the concept very quickly and these extremely lengthy digressions made slogging through to the end very difficult. Such an inspiring story. I wish the author had focused more on what Bielskis' accomplished and less on repeating every detail of camp life over and over again.
2,If you have patience,"The story is incredible. However, it is written very poorly and the author repeats things to many times."
4,"Beautiful, Nice details",I purchased both the Earth earrings and the necklace and think that they are beautiful. The details on them are really nice.
3,It's okay,"The smell for me is okay, I think I just got what I paid for, it's strong and aggressive, should know this point."
2,mediocre,"I scanned all the reviews here on Amazon before buying Chronicle Vol 2. I'd been inspired by hearing ""Walk on Water"" many times on Amazon and decided to buy the collection instead of CCR's eponymous first album. That was a mistake.This collection clearly appeals to committed fans, as is true for nearly all reviews I see on Amazon. I found it mediocre, at best. ""Walk on Water"" has passion, a wide vocal range and nice changes of pace. The rest of this 2 CD set is forgettable.Feel free to mark this review as ""not useful"" -- I do it often myself when reviews are not informative. Sorry if this review offends your sensibilities but it's not a vote on whether CCR was a great band: it was, and John Fogerty's put out some good stuff since.For the casual fan, get the original Chronicle (Vol 1) and enjoy."
3,"Greatest hits,it isn't","Chronicle 2 contains only one hit,""Born on the Bayou"" which was inexplicably left off the first Chronicle since it is a song that really defines the group's sound. The rest of the music is far from bad with some interesting covers thrown into the mix but if you just want the hits, get Chronicle and buy ""Born on the Bayou"" as a single off one of the music services."
5,ole ccr fan,couldn't resist - listened to proud mary from indy to fla one college break. great song so had to have the cd
2,Disappointing,"Chronicle was a let down for me. I guess Chronicle 1 had almost all of the best Credence songs. I actually bought this album for the song ""Midnight Special"" with the hope that the other songs would be as good or better. It had a lot of cover songs that I don't think they did particularly well."
2,Disappointed,Liked Volume I better. Was expecting more of the same. This Volume is totally different. More like rockabilly instead rock and roll. Must have been some of their earlier stuff.
5,CCR2,The music is GREAT if you like the 60's and 70's beat. Since I do alot of traveling the music keeps me going.
4,For the fan,"If you are just looking for a CD with some great CCR songs get Vol. 1. This CD has a title that is not completely correct. It is more a collection of covers or songs that have influenced the sound of CCR. ""Mary Lou"", ""Suzie Q"" etc. Some songs rock, some are a little on the tacky sound or are just good songs.Certainly not a great CD, but if you are a fan and want to know more about the development of the band. Country, old blues, rock 'n roll etc."
4,great addition for the second-tier CCR fan,"first tier fans need to go straight to the recently released box set, which contains their entire recorded history. fogerty didn't write a bad song for three years, and there were lots and lots of songs. with that said, here's some words on this particular release:it's vastly inferior to volume 1, but i knew that when i bought it for five bucks or so way back in the day. nevertheless, this collection is full of great jams and wonderful bayou-influenced wailing...it should function perfectly fine as a cool-down after listening to vol. 1. ""wrote a song for everyone"" is fogerty's forgotten masterpiece, and ""pagan baby"" shows how great CCR could be when they stretched their own sonic boundaries."
5,Terror at Sea True Adventures,"One man was caught inside a tornado. And one man broke through enemy lines in a home made tank. Another man Lived for years upside down whaling ship in the Arctic. These are just three of the amazing stories in this book. But as incredible as these stories seem, each one really happen!"
3,Ok for the situation,"This is a very simple product but my 8 year old saw it on TV and wanted it. When he got it, he loved it but I am not sure if all kids would. He is sick in bed and it was a good, mess free activity to break the boredom for a short time because it was different to other usual bed activities. It arrived extremely quickly so that was fantastic."
1,"Cheap, Over-packaged","This is a junky product in an oversized splashy box - NOT worth even Amazon's reduced price. The brightly colored box is quite misleading; this is one of those products where the packaging almost undoubtedly cost the manufacturer more than the product itself. The ""posters"" were little 8x10 sheets of paper, I naively assumed they'd be the size of the box! The color revealed after the rubbing is nothing like the box shows - no bright fun colors, only light pastel soft colors. The pictues inside were for a young audience, I'd say ages 2-6."
2,Inexpensive product from cheap production,"The first thing I noticed upon opening this package was that the silicon case is lighter weight than the original case I bought, making the material seem cheaper. However, I approve of the way this case extends over the buttons around the wheel, as they are easily pressed through the protection.The armband is almost unsatisfactory. It is made from cheap generic elastic and tends to slide around on my arm. Even the plastic junction on the band is poorly engineered and tends to turn sideways, loosening the elastic band and rendering it un-adjustable until you take it off or spend 5 minutes fiddling with it. The elastic is stiff enough that it restricts some movement in my arm during weightlifting.If you are planning on using this armband at the gym, I would suggest paying more for a better product."
1,Not worth the price,"This was a total waste of money. A cheap arm band, a thin almost colorless cover, a thin screen protector and with shipping, ridiculous price. Similar things at local competitors locally for a few bucks."
4,Still Pertinent?,"As it was written near 2000, a chapter or two suffer from obsolescence already, but the excellence of the rest of the content make it very forgivable."
5,A boon to job seekers and providers alike,"This book is a boon to job seekers and providers alike. I recommend it highly.As an IT professional I have had occasion to be on both sides of the interview desk. This book clarified and reinforced many of the beliefs that I formed from these experiences. However, I derived an even greater benefit from those sections that challenged my preconceptions. Mr. Adamsky's use of logic, examples, and self-deprecating humor helped me to see things from a different viewpoint. As a result I feel better prepared to operate in today's challenging job market."
4,Handmade photo album,I got this item for a nature lover and photographer in the family. It's very well made and was actually bigger than I expected. Thanks a lot!
2,Make sure you place it far from any water spray.,"Very useful if it works. Unfortunately it seems to be destroyed by the slightest spray of water. The way the front glass is mounted actually collects all water that hits the front and sends it inside. Then it will deteriorate in a few months. It is advertised as ""splash proof"", but it is not. I had two of them, both stopped working. So, if your application needs something waterproof get Ambient Weather GL152-TT-C 6"" Nautical Time and Tide Clock, it is actually waterproof."
3,It's ok,Works well. Extremely plastic. Too much plastic for the price. But ok. Looks ok but when you touch it....oh boy.
5,A good reference and an excelent textbook,"This book is relatively new (2006). Had to use the book for a graduate course at the University of Pittsburgh. It does not assume a EE background. Still standard engineering math background is necessary in order for one to grasp the material. The style is different than many other typical EE textbooks. I believe this is one of the advantages of this text. It is appropriate mostly for students, but it could be used by practitioners as a reference and a refreshing text. I appreciate the presence of chapters, like Information Theory, Multiplexing, Systems,Guided transmission and Photonics in addition to the rest of the material. The appendices cover Modeling and Simulation and Electromagnetic Waves. A minus is the price of the book. There are also some occasional typos. Overall the book is very good for the reader who is interested in the subject."
1,Worst than nothing,"Please -- if you're curious about kettlebell training, get almost any other book. All this book has for you is bodybuilding exercises substituting kettlebells for dumbbells. These authors have no kettlebell certifications."
4,Christopher Pike at his best,"Wow. A great novel. This book had an ending which was so...how should I say...surprising. It was a little bizzare, which is why I gave this book four stars instead of five. So, technicly, the ending had a good side and a bad side. The good side is the fact that the ending was very surprising. The bad side is the fact that it was so incredibly bizzare that it was kinda laughable...but other than that, what I stated is no good reason not to buy the book. the worlds that Christopher Pike creates is a place that is nice to visit as far as literature goes. And also, let me point out a warning before you read any of his books if you have not before: He's not at all afraid to show the dark side of human nature, and the dangers yet true reality of teenage years. Get this book. You won't regret it."
3,Idea good. Writing mediocre.,"Jenny wakes up in the woods with a dead body next to her. She can't remember anything, including her own name. She finds out the dead girl is her best friend Crystal and that Jenny might have slept with Crystal's boyfriend.The plot can be confusing, but is based on an interesting idea. Pike's strengths lie in ideas, not the actual writing."
5,Simply Amadeus,"Even the tale behind Amadeus, the sound track is remarkable, always on time when the events happened in the Mozart's life. The Great Mass, Don Giovanni, The Requiem told about the composer's success and frustrations."
3,Bad Vocabulary Cards,"I was expecting these cards to have the words translated at the back - they don't. If you can already read Hebrew do you need the cards? Ok, some might, but just know these cards don't have the words translated on the back.On the plus side, looking up the words so as to write them on the back of each card along with the definitions is a good study exercise so I'm keeping them."
4,"Good, but small and flimsy","I just received these cards in the mail today. There are a number of things that are positive, but a few things that are negative.Here are the positives:1. I like the fact that they are in a readable script style, instead of in a canned printed style. For some people, this seems to be a negative, but I think this is a big plus.2. I also appreciate how each card has different forms of the root word. This is very helpful.For me, there are two big negatives.1. They are fairly small. I wish they were bigger so that they could be more easily held in my hand.2. The paper itself is pretty flimsy. Between this and the size this makes the card fairly awkward to hold in one's hand.Overall, I think the cards will be helpful, but the negatives are worth considering. I debated whether I should buy these or the other set put out by Zondervan. I obviously chose this set. If I were to choose again, I might give the Zondervan set a lot more consideration."
3,Flash cards for novice learner,"I ordered two different sets of Hebrew flash cards but find that the ENGLISH pronunciation is not given on the reverse side. Somewhat disappointed though they may make more sense when I become more proficient. Meanwhile I will need to make my own cards for study purposes. If I had been able to see one of the cards before I ordered, I would have realized that they were a little above my level of Hebrew. They are for the more advanced though I am sure I will use them eventually."
4,Dog collar,"OK, but, my pup can back out of these. I got her a Martingale collar, instead, just like out Greyhound."
1,Not CLOSE to being chew-proof!,"This collar was chewed-through in less than 10 minutes by our puppy, the dog's previous collar lasted over 3 months & didn't claim to be chew-proof. DO NOT BUY if chewing is a consideration. In addition, there is no clasp or buckle, it has to be lengthened to slip over the dog's head for removal. A useless collar, IMO."
1,Dangerous if you have 2 dogs that like to play with each other,At first I loved this collar for our 1.5 year old female chocolate lab. However our 9 month old male yellow lab likes to bite on the female to get her to play with him. This past weekend they were playing and we heard yelping and crying coming from both of them as they both became stuck together. His teeth and upper jaw became entangled in the smaller loop. When he couldn't break free she started panic and began twisting and effectively strangling herself. We almost had to cut the collar off because we couldn't untangle them. The male broke his front tooth and injured his nose and probably needs surgery or tooth extraction. It was very frightening and I wouldn't buy a collar like this again.
5,grunts the little high pitched thing in halo halo 2,they r so funny the stuff they say in the game when u play as alieans in halo 2 htey say they aways hated u elites and they get scared when u kill a elite the say o my god he killed the elite cmon lets hide and the say stuff abuot the brutes the call master chief demon they act all srong un til u kill the elite the run waving thir guns in the air if u r under attack tand r waiting 4 ur healf they call u a coward and say r u hiding from me the are trully evil the laugh when they shoot u the r the cowsrds of the covendent.ps when u see a grunt chase it and it will dye of frieght
3,Kinda creepy,"What got to me most about this book is how attached Nelson becomes to Bundy. Being passionate about your opposition to the death penalty is one thing; speaking of a monster like Bundy as ""my Ted"" and buying him a Mickey Mouse watch when you go to Disneyland is something else. However, this does give a detailed look at Bundy's case from the judicial perspective, which hasn't been covered much before. Most people seem to want to read about the details of Bundy's gruesome crimes; if you've read all those books and want a new perspective, this is a worthwhile read."
4,The last and closest look at America's most nororious killer,"Just as Ann Rule's The Stranger Beside Me gave us an eyewitness account of the beginnings and middle of Ted Bundy's gruesome career, ""Defending the Devil"" covers the end. Think of it as a companion piece."
2,Too much about her own situation....,"...and not enough about the subject matter. Let's be honest, we buy books like these to learn more about folks like Ted Bundy. What we don't buy them for is to learn more than a bit about the writer. In this case, far too much time is spent detailing Ms. Nelson's situation and life as opposed to her work with Bundy. This isn't a horrible book, but it isn't a very compelling one either for this singular reason. Do yourselves a favor and look elsewhere if you're wanting to read new or different information about serial killer Ted Bundy."
3,Thorough but Dated,"This book covers a lot of ground and does a great job describing exactly what an art director does. However, the book was published in 1994. Technology in the past decade has dramatically changed the nature of film production, so a lot of the information in this book is very dated"
1,it is only 15 minutes,"When I have seen the 60 miutes of this DVD and because I really like Joel Osteen, I bought this DVD and I was expecting this DVD to be 60 Minutes, however, it is only 15 minutes!!!!!!!!!!It is really strange !!!!!!"
5,Great for both beginners and experts.,"This is an excellent book. I have been developing in Notes/Domino since R3, and still managed to find quite a bit of information in here that was new. Brian, Rocky, and Richard present their information in a clear and easy-to-understand conversational style. Instead of the ""I am the master; bow down in my presence"" feeling that comes across in other programming guides, reading this book is like having a conversation with a more experienced mentor / co-worker. I highly recommend this book to both novice and experienced developers."
2,Not for Beginners,"As with any book, it's only useful if it has what you want. Like many of the Bible series, it is rated for ""Beginning"", but it is really for experienced techs to add Lotus Notes to their skill set. The book assumes that you are familiar with scripting languages. If you aren't, don't expect this book to help you much. There are no reference materials for any of the functions or commands, no syntax helps, and no tutorials for the programming at all. Yet most of the chapters rely on programming extensively."
1,Not for Beginners,"I'm surprised at the rave reviews that everyone is giving this book. I have this book and I've been reading through it and it starts off fine as it has you build a simple application in the beginning. I found that promising because I've never used Lotus Notes before so I thought this would be an excellent book. The only problem is that once you're finished with that chapter, it goes from good to really bad. The book then becomes a reference manual for the different aspects of Lotus Notes. It provides no tutorials whatsoever as one astute reviewer on here points out. If I wanted this kind of reference I could have read the help documentation for Lotus Notes. This book is only useful for people who have mastered many aspects of Lotus Notes and even then its explanations of aspects like commands are dry and not put into context."
4,Excellent resource,"Even though I work with Domino 8, I find this resource very handy. It has basic information that Isomehow miss in the IBM documentation."
2,Print the online help manual or buy this book,"Pretty disappointing...reads like an online help manual. It does not contain any examples, does not teach practical applications or creative uses."
2,A few good tracks but mostly lame,"This disc has a few authentic sounding and nice but very brief pieces of Napoleonic military music, a few maudlin vocal interpretations, and way too many cheesy marches played on bass guitar and synthesizer. Overall, the disc is altogether too brief and unsatisfying."
5,tubtrub,Tubtrubs are great and come in a variety of sizes and colors. I even used them as an Easter basket for my college age kids. They loved receiving a busket full of goodies and it was just in time for final exams.
1,Don't buy this if you want brass bristles.,I bought this as it states in the description that the bristles are brass. This seller does not have brass in stock and you will get steel. They did refund my payment though.
1,"Brush is not brass as advertised, should have listened to others....","I ordered this brush through Amazon and it was fulfilled by Grady's Online. The brush would have been great had it been the brass version as advertised. I received the stainless steel version of this brush (sigh). I gave it one star as it was not the product I ordered but I will point out that I was given a full refund. Buyer's beware, you may not get the brass version as advertised."
2,"""Brass Bristles"" needs to be deleted from description","I ignored the other reviews which warned this doesn't have brass bristles but ya know what, they were right! IT DOESN'T HAVE BRASS BRISTLES, IT HAS STEEL BRISTLES! This doesn't help where I bought the brush for someone who specifically wanted brass bristles. Amazon really needs to change the description. I've asked for a refund and I'm assuming I'll get it."
4,Works great,"Flat out, this works. It doesn't clog like a traditional brush. The long handle will be a bonus if/when cleaning a grill with live coals."
5,Melodious Magnificence,A heart-stirring adaptation of New Age maestro Kitaro's brilliantly conceived symphonies by Yu-Xiao Guang - unquestionably one of China's greatest musical geniuses.Very highly recommended.
4,Sound Out!,"As an LD teacher, I have found the materials in this book to be an excellant adjunct in the reading/language arts programs for my students. Many special educational plans include word families and the mastering of vowels, r-controlled vowels, and dipthong sounds when needed for decoding. These materials give guided instruction in these areas with varied practice. My only concern is the size of the print in many areas of the book. It is too small for students with visual processing difficulties and I have needed to enlarge some of the pages. Overall, it is a nice addition to my curriculum library."
2,A waste of time......,"This book contains case-studies on Clairvoyance from 1916. This is not a book on developing Clairvoyance or any psyhic powers. This book is only a clear description of what Clairvoyance is and the various types of psyhic powers. So in other words, pick up a dictionary and look up the meaning of ""Clairvoyance"" and you will get just as much info as you will reading this book!"
2,Ditto,"Gotta go with what the reader in Wilmington said. Too predictable, too slow, too blaa. Next time I'll read the reviews first. Aren't there any good books anymore?"
5,Remarkable and a classic literature for the Law professional and students,"Criminology, from Raffaele Garofalo, is a remarkable masterpiece in the law literature which is very actual, even though it was written 122 years ago. Garofalo was ahead of his time, being able to capture the realism of the criminology for that world age while providing ideas for the future which should guide the new and global world environmet in the Criminal Science . It is a must for those who wants to understand the criminal principles and aspects and the still needed steps to continue promoting the progress for the modern society."
2,"""Do"" judge a book by it's cover",I love Cousteau and family but am only familiar with the videos. Give me something to look at!Thanks
3,"Good, but could be better",I couldn't resist buying this model when my old Sonicare died. It is very nice but could be better. Changing the toothpaste is not real convenient and it seems to get much more dirty inside the toothbrush which requires one to take it apart and clean it often. The toothbrush works great but toothpaste is hard to find in the local stores. I wonder how well it is selling and if Sonicare will stay committed to keeping us supplied with brushes and toothpaste for this setup.
3,Faithful to the tunes,"My review falls somewhere in between the others. I am a big fan of CCR, and I was psyched when I found this disc. However, I am also disillusioned by the short format of the songs. Not that I want extended jams every time, but I don't want to hear the studio version redone exactly either. Even the guitar solos are almost exact. With that said, the energy is definitely there, and Fogerty's vocals are growling throughout, and there are highlights like the sing alongs ""Midnight Special"" and ""Night Time is the Right Time."" ""Keep on Chooglin'"" is worth the price of the disc alone, so any CCR fan will want this album. My preferred live perfomance, however, is at the closing of the Fillmore West, which is much less predictable."
3,C. C. R. really in concert!,"This is the CCR live album to get, if you want to hear them really playing live and doing their songs just like their records, but faster. In this way, they were a very 60's type band. It was kind of cute this swamp rock thing. Sound quality is good enough, so enjoy an hour of CCR.Essential live albums from the 70's:Deep Purple - Made In JapanThe Who - Live At Leeds"
5,Fantastic Skin Renewal,"I began using Adrienne Arpel over 30 years ago when you could only purchase her line in the beauty salon of Neimans or Saks. I have never replaced the quality of skin care that her products offered and I have tried every skin care line. This peel is exactly what it says it is -- a true exfoliating peel. Use in conjuction with the Honey Almond Scrub -and you will see a remarkable difference in your skin. I have used this for over 30 years. -I have tried other products -nothing comes close --I always come back. Try it -you will see-- it is wonderful. Your skin will be brighter, firmer, and you will achieve the clean -iridescent look of beautiful-healthy skin.For a while -I could not find this product -but since I started shopping on Amazon --it's no problem!!"
5,Love Neville and this did not disappoint!,"This was one of the few I haven't read by Neville, and I loved it...! It will be one of my favs...."
2,One of My Favorites,"Neville is one of my favorite authors. I think what we term as ""NEW THOUGHT"" is actually ages old thought, revisited. It's comforting to know that Neville's ideas and thoughts are so well-articulated as evidenced by this book."
5,Excellent reference of the subject matter,"This book is well-written and well organized, presenting just the right level of information for the experienced facilitator to make a choice. For the less experienced, a great introduction to many approaches. The summary in the back gives a quick comparison. The graphics help the visually-oriented reader."
3,Gives you some things to think about,"I read this book as a requirement for a Dispensationalism class in Seminary. It gives you a look at what Progressive Dispensationalists believe. Since I am a classic Dispensationalist, I did not agree with much of the book. However, it helped me to understand their position. I wrote a paper on their view and subsequently received an A so the book did its job."
3,Bad?,"Nobody cares about some guy that William Hardecker supposedly checked with. You don't like it because it tells the truth about National Israel, Spiritual Israel, and the Church. Get over it."
4,Clear and Easy to Read,"I was looking for something that clearly explains and introduces XML and XSL, Paul Spencer has done a good job. The book flows well and is easy to read. While I had little HTML or ASP knowledge which is recommended I was able to follow all the examples and come out with a good understanding. A case study is provided at the end of the book which ties all the concepts together, it requires certain software and hardware components, so I didn't attempt it, but if it's like the rest of the book, it will be clear and methodical."
4,Learn by example...,This book explains XML (both theory and practice) by following through an example system. There are plenty of code samples for you to try out and the author explains step-by-step the longer code samples.Overall an enjoyable read.
2,Very MS centric,"While some people assume Microsoft is the centre of the universe, the rest of us use a multitude of operating systems, technologies, and software vendors. This particular book is focused completely on the MS/IE view of XML (and related technologies) ... and I found that even that was quite basic. It missed the whole design arena of schema development (dtd), including standard schemas, good schema design, etc. Quite a poor buy in my opinion."
5,Black-Eyed Susan,"Great book, l love the details and the research you put into the area and your wonderful characters. I have read most of your books and love the way they move along...always something new to think about. Thank you Deborah for another good read."
4,Ok book...,"Their passions ran as free as the land they vowed to tame...Ever since she could remember, dark-eyed Susan Armitage had longed for Logan Vance - the one man who could never be hers. Then one day an unexpected twist of fate brought the virile adventurer into her life. Driven by a reckless desire she could no longer deny, Susan scandalized St.Louis society by agreeing to accompany Logan and his two young children on their long journey west through Indian Territory. In the rugged Oklahoma wilderness, what had begun as a marriage of convenience soon erupted in a raging tempest of passions unbound. Yet as they gloried in the ecstasy of their sensuous union, Logan and Susan found their dreams threatened by struggle for survival that would test the very limits of their bold and searing love."
1,Inexcusable Handling!,"When my shipment arrived and I opened the box, the four bottles of product which I ordered were loose inside of the box with no padding or packaging of any kind. I could't believe it! I would never use this supplier again!"
5,Wanna learn C++...this is the book!!,"This book is an excellent book for learning C++. It teaches you the fundamentals, and it will keep you coming back for more and more reading because you are learning something about the language. I highly recommend this book to anyone who doesn't know anything about C++. I can't believe I'm learning C++! Buy the book, you won't be sorry."
5,Charming Story,"A charming, life-affirming story from the author I came to know through the wonderful film 84 Charing Cross Road. The illustrations are whimsical, as well."
3,Mixed,"I have two Nighteater scopes. One is on my CZ 453 varmint .22 and the other is on my Remington 700 deer rifle in .308. With the one on the .22, I have hit the center of a dime at 100 yards. With the one on the Remington, I continually have parallax problems. Sometimes I have to have things slightly out of focus to get rid of the parallax."
1,Poor Quality,I received this radio and had to ship it back the same day. The CD player worked once and never worked again. The knobs are extremely small and hard to turn. The overall craftsmanship of this item is poor. I would suggest you try another unit.
1,"Redneck Rampage was one of the greats, but don't buy this version","This is just a demo version repackaged. It only has seven levels and no movies - although maybe the reason I couldn't see the movies was because of my hardware. Which brings me to my other point, be prepared to do a lot of nerd-hacking to try to get this to run on Windows XP, no matter which version you buy."
2,Save Your Money,"This thin, superficial book isn't *bad*, but it doesn't tell you anything you don't already know. This book is a waste of time and money if your common sense alone tells you to relax and be prepared with questions during the interview and to do your apps and essays neatly and carefully. Look elsewhere for *really* helpful insights."
3,not bad,Not bad. So far it is working well. Either this is not a genuine cell or BP-6M is not the most powerful model.
4,Surprisingly Good Product,"This product came packaged with Treasure Cove and Treasure Mathstorm. My 7 year old, who is particularly ept with computers and games, loved this and LEARNED from it. It is actually great for age 4 - ? Its fun and requires the child to learn in order to advance. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,classic,"I used to play treasure mountain when i was a kid and its one of those games that you never forget. as i grew up i was always itching to play it one last time. ( and by one last time i mean ""a million more times"")!!"
5,Long lasting fun,"We bought this over 10 years ago and my teens still play it (rarely) to relive their childhood. I keep it on the computer for young guests to amuse themselves safely--it is easy to learn and even only a few minutes is satisfying, then they can start again next time they visit. Highly recommended!"
3,"Another book on my ""have to"" read list....","This book looks interesting enough, but haven't had the time to get really involved in it."
3,Designed For Flyfishers Who Camp,"I'm not a camper so this was not the best flyfishing guide for me. It is oddly organized by the roads or highways you drive in various regions of Montana. There is a terrific opening section giving descriptions of the ten top attractor dry flys. Maps are fair at best -- river access points and bridge crossings are not identified. Some funny ""war stories"" by the author. All photos are black and white."
5,Minivan totaled. Child walked away with barely a scratch.,"Six days ago, while traveling on a four-lane road, a car from a side road drove directly across my lane. Having no time to react, my Toyota minivan smashed into the other car--airbags deployed, the windshield cracked in several places, the dying electrical system sparked and flared--it was no fender bender. I'm a sprained, bruised and battered mess but my 4 yr. old barely has a scratch. She has two very slight lacerations near the top of each shoulder where the harness bit a little. And that probably occured because she was in a sleeveless shirt when the accident happened. I heard a policeman and an EMT both say how lucky she was to be in that carseat. I know for certain that we'll be getting another Marathon to last until she reaches the weight limit."
3,Only until they are 18 months,"Worked well until my daughter was 18 months old, after that is just too tight on her legs, she can wear as a regular seatbelt but is very unsafe."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"Loved the car seat, until my Daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps. I would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat. That is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat."
5,Marathan car seats ROCK!,"I originally registered for a Decathalon because I thought the higher price tag would mean a better car seat. Wrong. My husband had a hell of a time putting this in our SUV. There were too many pads and contraptions that could have easily just been taken off but they didn't exactly explain this clearly in the instructions. Plus, everytime I put my 6 month old daughter in it, she would cry. She didn't like it and she was always slumped over when she fell asleep. I wasn't thrilled about the boring grey color and there weren't that many pretty colors that this car seat came in at the time, so I decided to purchase a Marathon in Olivia pattern for my SUV and give the Decathalon to my husband. My daughter LOVES the Marathon and won't cry anymore when I put her in. It gives you the option to tilt her further back so she's no longer slumped over when she naps. I like both of the car seats but for my next child, I'll be registering for a Marathon for sure."
1,Seatbelt buckle doesn't buckle,"On the first one I received only one of the two clips made a clicking sound when inserted into the buckle and you had to push *really* hard to get the clips in. So I called Britax and they sent me a replacement buckle and on the replacement buckle, neither one of the clips made a clicking noise when inserted into the buckle and again I had to push really hard to get them the buckle and I am not convinced they are really locked in - guess you wouldn't really know until an accident happened. Well, I am not taking the chance, so back it goes. When I called Britax about the second buckle - they told me it was normal for there not to be a clicking noise when the clips go into the buckle. Yeah right, I'm not waiting for an accident to find out whether the clip is really locked into the buckle or not!"
1,TERRIBLE CRASH TEST RESULTS FROM CONSUMER REPORTS!,"I just purchased this car seat based on Consumer Reports' top rating. Now, a few days after my purchase, Consumer Report has issued a new report concerning Marathon's poor performance with the LATCH system. See the report at http://www.consumerreports.org/main/content/display_report.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=579525&bmUID;=1112710646446#. I am shocked and dismayed that Britax has not used similar procedures to test out their car seats and fixed the problem. They were probably sitting on their laurels for far too long.So, I regret purchasing this product and wished that I had purchased the Evenflo Titan V instead.Hopefully, Britax will recall and replace this defective product soon."
2,a thrity minute movie,"at first, i was absolutely furious when it stopped after less than half an hour! I was surprised it wasn't stated in cinemania's biography of miss Davis,now i know why. On the other hand, it's a small piece of work of hers that i wouldn't have ever seen if it hadn't been released on video so i suppose it's good. I would only recommend it to miss Davis fan base though, it's the only people this movie can interest."
4,Festive,"If your children can't wait one more minute for Christmas, this will occupythem for a few minutes until they start dreaming of presents again.Each page has a scratch and sniff sticker that is cleverly hidden in the pictures.Scents: Christmas Tree, Candy Canes, Spicy Cookies, Soap, Chocolate.~The Rebecca Review"
2,Book fell apart,"Unfortunately this 32 year old paperback fell apart when I started to read it. I am not sure what""good condition"" means in this context."
3,Not the best.,"You get what you pay for. This are nice and cheap, but there's much better quality out there if you want it and are willing to pay for it."
5,I FOUND IT!,This product was so hard to find......I shopped all the dept.store and drug store fragrance counters and none of them carried it. Next time I'll know to just go to Amazon!
5,This card game is a must have!,"Once Upon a Time is a delightful game in which players use cards in their hands to tell a story. Other players may interrupt a story by playing certain cards and then they continue the story. You are trying to tell a story to reach your Happily Ever After card. Every game is different, you are only limited by your imagination! The cards are beautifully illustrated and it's definitely worth the price!!!"
5,Storytelling Cards Received and Reviewed,The Storytelling Cards are a great idea for various ages. We made up our own rules for playing by alternating turns to continue the story. It was interesting to see what imaginations we all have when we're given the opportunity and prompts to use them.
3,great concept- not an easy fun time though,"Got this for our nieces (6 and 8).... thinking they have a flair for the dramatic and knowing the 6 year old wouldn't be up for it alone yet. Its not an easy game, though I really wanted to love it and was excited about it. Would be great fun for natural storytellers, and certainly stretched all of our story-telling muscles. The girls did like it and quickly filled in the blank cards with their favorite kind of items.so the stories don't just come together. It probably would be a great way for helping get people to practice making up stories, that just felt more like work than fun.alas."
4,Campfires end happily ever after with this game...,"Once upon a time cards have enchanting illustrations and a multitude of uses. The game can be adapted to bring out creativity in any agegroup. Character, event, place, descriptive and item cards add elements to the stories you create while ending cards direct the general theme of your story...but all the other players are directing the story to a different ending! Can you get the Farm boy together with the princess so they can live ""happily ever after"" or will the witch send the princess to another relm from which ""she was never seen again""?I have used the cards in story telling and to direct skits, with first graders, highschool students and college students, at resident camp and parties. They are always fun, I only wish there were more decks to choose from!"
5,"Fun, challenging, makes you think","This is a rare and unique game. We've played it with our seven-year old daughter, and had a lot of fun. Here are my caveats:* Make sure you read the rules thoroughly-particularly regarding BOTH ways of interrupting.* Give the younger kids a bit of leeway, in both time and critical judgement of their story line.* Don't give any leeway to adults!This one makes you think. Have fun!"
5,"Wonderful game for the young, young at heart and for language learners","I got Once Upon A Time when I was a teacher in Japan as something fun for students to try. Since then I've used it with adult students of all ages and levels. The rich illustrations and iconic story cards really spurred them to the next level.I broke it out for the first time in a while for my cousins aged 8 to 14 and they all loved it.I'm ordering a set for them now. Great, great game."
1,ZERO STARS - A real piece of junk - DONT BUY,"so far this thing has done nothing but waste a good bottle of tequila and raise my blood pressure. It has no ability to grind ice. When i first got it, i looked at the 'grinder' and 'grinder cage' and was a bit puzzled how these two non-aggressive looking pieces could ever possibly grind ice into a slush. I was right . . . they can't. I don't see how they ever arrived at a $100.00 price tag for this worthless thing!"
1,Another Dissatisfied Customer,Found this marked down to $50 and tried it on a whim. Wish I'd checked the reviews first. We tried to give this thing a fair shot and have made several batches. The blending/grinding mechanism passes chunks of ice through it. Had to chew the drinks. Continuing to blend resulted in watery drinks that still had chunks in them. We never got a slushy consistency. It's going back tomorrow.
1,The Margarator On the Rocks Processing Machine,The Margarator will process your ingredients to small pebbles of ice and a liquid and then all liquid. All you will need is ice for a margarita on the rocks. I am taking the machine back and hoping for better results from a quality blender.
1,Doesn't last,Warning: you'll only get about 10 uses from this and the last few were hit or miss whether it would work. Very disappointing.
1,Piece of JUNK!,"The first time I used it, the machine produced a great daiquiri. When I tried to use it again, the plastic piece that secures the lid broke, which stops the motor...out came the duck tape. It was no use because the slushee I tried to make was a watery mess. What a waste of money! Into the garbage it goes."
3,Margarator ok,"I have used this machine three times now and so far so good. Instead of Margarita mix I use 2 cans frozen limeade concentrate and add a can of tequilla,fill with ice and wait. It does take more than 15 minutes to get slushy and what you see in the container which is liquidy and icey is not what comes out of the spigett. If the concentrate is too sweet or strong add a little water. Not too much or they get too watery and tasteless. I am relatively happy with this product. Yes it is loud and it does take longer than stated on instructions but for me so far it works. It is a big blender but it beats making smaller batches all day. I like mine slushy and at times we have had to use a spoon because it was so thick. Maybe I just got lucky....knock on wood."
3,Works good enough,"This product works good enough, just a word to the wise, if you use ice from your freezer it's going to take longer. Mind you, my freezer is VERY cold! This makes for rock hard ice. Rock hard ice takes time. I believe if you let the ice soften slightly you will have better results in the long run."
1,The margarator sucks,"The Margarator is a very bad product! Long story short, it just flat out does not work correctly. Do your research on this product before buying it, their are plenty of people who are not happy with the performance or the customer service from the maker. I myself had no luck making a quality drink as they claim it makes and I have still not heard back from their customer service people after two attempts. I have since taken the machine back and bought a Jimmy Buffett Margarita maker and I must say it works absolutely great although it cost $300."
4,Great Machine,"We've been using this thing for months not one problem so far. 6-8 minutes and you have a gallon of the best drinks ever, going to buy another for Non alcoholic drinks for the kids."
1,get your money back!!,Margarator Margarita Maker made the worst margarita. instead of smooth creamy margarita. i got watery and lumpy margaritas. this machine is Noisy and leaks all over your counter top. i had to put a towel under the machine. i brought a slush machine from smart & final for 49.99 and works much much better. i want my money back
1,should be titled headache machine,"I went thru 2 of these. Both returned under warranty. The first one did not work on AC, the second worked great the first time, was lots of fun, the second time, the spigot broke, with a gallon of margaritas stuck in the machine. Stick with a blender"
1,party only,"this item is good for a party setting, not for small gatherings. The quantities you must mix are large (1 gallon at a time) because otherwise the machine does not work properly. If you wait to serve the second batch it is watered down because of the amount of ice that you have to put in to make the machine work. The Margarator works much slower than the directions state. After 3 unsuccessful attempts to make the perfect batch of margaritas I returned the machine!"
1,Plastic clip broke on first try,"What a great idea, I wish it worked. Purchased at Belk's Dept. store. First time we tried it a plastic clip on the grinding cage broke and it stopped (like it should if all parts are not functional, so that's something, I guess.) We assume the crescent-shaped ice cubes from our ice maker were too much for it, which is a pi** poor design since that's what your average user will be using. After reading all the other reviews, we're returning it for credit rather than replacement - I don't like my odds of the 2nd (or 3rd, etc.) unit I try actually delivering on what it promises."
1,"So Far, So Bad.............","Well, yesterday I wrote a glowing review on the Margorator HSB-590. That is the stainless steel model that served us so well for about 3 years and hundreds of uses. I wish that I could say something good about the plastic version, the msb-585. I bought it on clearance from my grocery store late 2009. It was going to be my backup unit.It worked great......once. On second use the stainless steel grate and plastic locking ring became dislodged during the blend. I had to pour my margaritas into a pitcher, being careful to extract the broken piece of locking ring and the two locking tabs. I emailed the company and I'm hoping for something good to happen, but I have serious doubts, as it has a 90 day warranty, and I didn't even open it up for months."
1,Would not recommend this machine,"I was extrememly disappointed with this purchase. It came without parts, which had to be sent at a later dadate. After the parts arrived, the machine did not work at all. I returned it for a full refund."
1,ripped off,"Purchased this item and used 5 times total. It did not produce a drink like the blender did and leaked from the spout. It burned out and the company told me it was out of warranty. I want to tell everyone not to purchase this, stick to a more expensive machine or just use your blender. Not worth the money I spent on it for 5 uses."
2,Not as good as you'd think....,"I realized this was a cheap machine both from the price and because Nostalgia has a reputation for producing junk. But, being a specialized unit strictly for frozen drinks I expected a little better performance.Mine had to be modified due to a warped lid not allowing the safety switch to be engaged unless you were standing on it. Spout leaks like crazy.My suggestion would be to experiment with the ice-to-ingredient ratio to try and get an actual slushy drink out of it... it seems to be hit or miss.But... for the price I can't complain too much and I've more than gotten my $80 worth out of it at various pool parties."
1,Save your money!,"I have gone through two of these units and I have friend who also tried and failed. The motors can not stand up even to a 5-10 person margarita party. I ended up pulling out my 15 year old Hamilton-Beach blender to save the day (and the party). Looks cool but stay clear, unless of course you are looking to give up alcohol."
4,Great for Parties,"I purchased this product, because I always get stuck in the kitchen blending Margaritas during parties. A group of friends came over and we tried the machine...it work GREAT! I was ""free"" to mingle!"
2,I'll stick to the blender,I bought this from the Home Shopping Network last year and just finally got a chance to use it. I hate it. It leaks from the top when it is mixing. The drink does not get slushy and the spout continues to drip after you pour a drink so you have to put something under it so it doesn't get everything wet. It takes a whole bottle of mix which seems ridiculous. All in all I will stick to my trusty blender (it's cheaper).
1,Poor.,"It just didn't make sense to me how a stainless steel ring recessed into the bottom of a container cold actually crush ice into the nice slushy drink that was pictured on he box. Although I was happy to receive this as a gift, my initial skepticism turned out to be well warranted. No slushy, frozen drinks, just watery ones. Oh well, it makes cold drinks, and you can carry them around, even though it is a bit cumbersome. Next purchase is probably going to be the Maragaritaville one, it certainly appears that it does the job it advertises."
1,Stay Away from this item!!!!!,"The margarator worked great the first three or four times we used it. We took it camping, birthdays, BBQ. Always used the regular plug in, not car adaptor. Well, took it out yesterday, and nothing, no power. Two of my girlfriends also bought this at the same time (so we could have different varieties of drinks at our get togethers) but they have all quit working. There was no funny sounds, or anything to indicate it was getting ready to quit on us. Just plugged it in and nothing. We tried car plug in and nothing.A total waste of money, it should operate longer that a handful of times for the price. Especially since it's obvious my unit is not the only one that's a piece of junk. I didn't bother to contact the manufacturer after reading the other reviews of this product and reading that contacting the manufacturer gets a person nowhere.Too bad, because our DID make great drinks and was handy when it worked."
3,Call them back,"We've had our machine for over a year and never had any problems with it until the 4th of July weekend. The first time I contacted the company I got that ""it sucks to be you"" attitude. I called back to let them know how I felt about their customer service and this time I got someone willing to help. She is having the repair parts sent to me right away. She said the company is working to improve their image. Wish me luck."
3,Good solid Luther Vandross production,"with very good songs like the funky title track, the silky ballad ""Whether Or Not The World Gets Better"" (with Phoebe Snow, a song Vandross would later record himself) and a nice cover of the Supremes' ""Love Child"". Interestingly, Vandross' bio states this album was never released but I own it!"
3,House that Jack Built,Jack should have listened to his father. Joe Mantegna was great as always .He should have been in more scenes in the beginning. Exsplaining the plot of the movie better.
5,The best racing game i've ever played on gamecube besides Mario Kart Double Dash!!! A must have for all gamecube owners!!,"Ok so i ordered this on ebay and i got it in the mail yesterday so i fired this game up in my trusty gamecube and i LOVED it!! You can now race not only Nextel, But You Can Also Race The National(Busch) series, the Crafstman Truck Series, And Last but not least, The Featherlite Modified Series. My Favorite track on this game is the Talladega Infield, Why? Because Your Racing On The Infield at the Talladega Superspeedway at Nighttime!! The Event's name at the Talladega infield is the Dixieland500k, Note. K stands for Kilometers. To all owners of the gamecube or wii owners that have gamecube memory cards and controllers, BUY THIS GAME NOW Nascar or Non-Nascar fans!!!!"
2,It's just OK,"Although not a ""skilled"" knitter I have been knitting for a while. I wanted to increase my knowledge but did not have time to attend class---I purchased this DVD. Frankly, I expected more. At each section there is a pause---well that's why I have a remote, I can pause the DVD myself. (This is not the only series of DVD's that does this and it drives me crazy). The first two or three sections, the welcome, introduction and how to cast on are directly from previous DVD--it's boring and I did not need. The actual knitting method is good but there is not enough substance. At the end they added a ""blooper"" section----absolutely unnecessary, and not funny. I wish they had used the ""blooper time"" for more of the actual knitting lessons."
4,Easy To Learn Instruction,"This DVD gave me everything I needed to finally do Entralac knitting after several attempts over the years. Yes, it is not going to win awards for polish and glamour of a professional DVD, BUT, it is done well and in a very comfortable format and was easy to watch and follow. I did appreciate all the little tips through out and completed a hat the very first time I watched the DVD. I was also able to grasp the whole entralac mystery from the instruction and with a few K2Tg and SKPO on either side was able to do flat entralac. Thanks for taking time and effort to produce this presentation. Oh and one more positive, this DVD was half the cost of a class at my LYS and I stayed in my PJs!"
2,Not What I Expected,"This book is tailored for older children and even then it's not well written for them. The details are too numerous to keep the young child's attention. There are not enough picture illustrations and the situations described herein are not general enough to fit society as a whole. There is too much of a focus on the ""wrong"" things to do in school verses the right things. Many of the suggestions and story's of how children did things the wrong way can backfire on parents and actually give children ideas of the wrong things to try. Much of the book could not be used for our home and school life situations. Few children will stay captivated by this book. My eldest child who is gifted thought it was boring and many of the issues she couldn't even relate to. My youngest was in over his head and I had to skip reading the long drawn out situations and paraphrase things to keep his attention."
4,enjoying class time,I am using this book in my special education class. The kids understand it and it is very easy to use. They enjoy working and I enjoy that.

My youngest was in over his head and I had to skip reading the long drawn out situations and paraphrase things to keep his attention."
4,Social Skills book,"This book is helpful for the social skills group that I run, however the book has worksheets, not activities to do with the kids. It is mostly focused on behavior in school. It is a good supplemental tool for me."
4,Higher,"This book was not appropriate for the students in my TMI classroom, but was designed for higher functioning students and would be a great tool for students with milder impairments."
4,Great for working with foster kids,"I have used this book to help teach foster children in both a group and individual setting. It works well for children of all levels of functioning, not solely special needs. The examples in the book are well writen and cover all aspects of a childs socialization in school, at home, and with peers. I did have to omit a couple of worksheets that gave examples of how not to behave as it presented ideas that would be copied by low functioning or defiant kids. The systematic review of social skills utilizing worksheets and discussions has made this book a great addition to my work library."
2,not worth the price,This was a very flimsy and skimpy piece of merchandise.If you need a cap for a child - look elsewhere.
1,paper cap,"might be ok as a party hat. very thin.bought for ngrandson but wont give it to him, poor quality would not recomend"
1,Not what I expected,"Flimsy and cheap. Ended up going to osh-kosh to buy a better quality one. Don't waste your time, unless you're looking for a good party favor for several children for, say, a Thomas the Tank Engine party. Then this would be the perfect purchase."
1,Not something to buy!,"This hat looks cute in the picture, but not of the quality one would buy for a child. I think even washing this one time, it would almost fall apart at the seams as they are not finished & will fray. Hat is not made of sturdy fabric. Returned product. Seller was excellent to work with, concerning any problems with this product!"
1,Disappointed,Image does not adequately represent product. Actually cap is more of a royal blue and bright white hat. Material is very lightweight.
2,"cute, but it is what you pay for","This is cute. My son will like it, but it's really flimsy. I picked this one because in the picks it looks like it would match a pair of overalls I found that are perfect for a train conductor and they are worn and this looked kind of faded. It just got here and in person the blue is very bright and bold. I think I'm going to wash it in hot water or somehow fade it so it will match better and I may still try and find a hat quality version of this. This one feels like it was made from a bedsheet...again, kids will like it pretty well but if your putting a dress-up trunk together that you want to last for years and several kids and or grandkids this one will not hold up."
2,"bad hat, great customer service","I bought this hat for my child, when I got it I was very disappointed with the quality of the material. I contacted the retailer and their customer service was quite on top of it, I returned the hat. Even if I didn't get what I wanted I felt I had a good experience on a human level, something that most times is lost in shopping online. I would be comfortable in buying from this retailer in the future."
1,Item looks nothing as pictured.,"I was not pleased with the quality of this hat. The fabric is very thin, looks nothing as resembled in the photo. Returned for full refund."
3,It works well,"I have this vacuum head since one month and have used it twice. The quality is good relative to the price and it does the job.Revised: I am using it now since more than one year. I still works but, the plastic ring which keeps the hose connection in place is broken after 3 months because the cheap quality. I have to decrease my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars."
3,As long as you move slowly this is GREAT,"This vacuum head is nice...works very well unless you move too quickly. If you move too quickly it ""pops a wheelie"" and you have to slow down and go over the area again.Over all...a good product"
2,unclear description,"I have an above ground pool and I did not realize that this is more for inground concrete pools?My criticism is that there were absolutely NO directions in the packaging. In addition, after calling the Swimline customer service, I discovered I have to have some type of hose to connect with it.I am returning it because I just wanted a simple vacuum I could use with my above ground pool without a lot of expense, but this is too confusing and expensive with having to buy the pool hose as well."
1,POOR QUALITY....DO NOT PURCHASE,"I used this product perhaps 3 times before it broke. The extension where the pole is inserted broken into pieces during normal use. One of the few times a product I purchased from Amazon.com turned out to be a dud, but I blame the manufacturers and not Amazon.com. I paid a bit more and found a quality product elsewhere that works fine."
2,The hose is not sitting tight.... Difficult to use.,The product itself is ok (nothing special) however the hose is not sitting tight on it.It slides off all the time - it makes cleaning impossible - they should have done the plastic tube longer and a bit larger (.01 inch or so) in diameter.
2,poor quality,"The ring to keep the water intake tube in place is broken on arrival. Even it's not broken, the connection to vaccum hose won't be secure because it could pop off easily. Amazon did process the return quickly and didn't ask me to ship it back."
4,excellent product,"the product actually works, i've been using it for a couple of months, been good so far, works as described."
2,"Difficult to assemble, broke on first use","This thing has a spring that has to be inserted between the base and the handle. No instructions, awkward to maneuver, and I might have got it backwards because instead of pushing itself down onto the pool surface, it kept flipping towards vertical whenever I lifted the head off the bottom slightly.The other issue is the nozzle. It is held in place by a friction-fit plastic ring. First time I used the vacuum, pushing the hose down over the nozzle, the ring popped up, leaving the nozzle slipping up and down in the vacuum base.To their credit, Amazon processed the refund without requiring me to ship back the item."
1,No good for a concrete or gunnite pool!,"This vacuum arrived quickly, but sucked at its job.Very lightweight and small, it literally didn't pick up anything from the bottom of my gunnite pool. If you havea completely uniform pool, it might pick something up, but on mine, it did nothing. It is too light to stay on the bottom as well...any movement and it loses its seal.Spend a few extra bucks and get a decent vacuum."
2,Operator error?,"Thought this would attach easily to my vacuum line, but could not for the life of me get it to stay attached. Not sure if it was a problem with my vacuum line, a problem with the vacuum head, or me just being a moron. No directions included, so we'll never know."
5,Made well.,"This product came as we expected and is made to last, I was very pleased with the price and durability."
4,Pool Vacuum Head,"This item works for my purpose but it still needs to beheavier and a little wider, It does a good job and I would recommendit."
4,Great for the price,"I bought this product for my 18 foot above-ground Intex pool. It was purchased to replace a battery-operated ""vacuum stick"" that took WAY too long to clean the pool. This weighted vacuum head worked perfectly, cutting my pool cleaning time by 75%. For $20, this was a great buy."
4,Math Rock really rocks!,"This is a fun math game based on the popular show Schoolhouse Rock - it is a great way to get kids to practice math skills as they navigate ""Funky Numberland."" Although the sound may be annoying at times, it is a fun game for kids (grades 1-5). The software is easy to navigate and has tons of cool graphics/animations. It has different levels for kids to play and makes them collect coins for later use or as they play the ""Road to Fame"" game. It has a great teacher or parent support documents (allowing them to check and print out a child's or a class' progress, or simply track what has been done) and help is easy to find (by clicking the big question mark). It's a useful tool for encouraging a child to like math."
2,"Not what I thought, Buy the video instead","This was a very dissapointing purchase. I think maybe the targeted age should be increased to 8-10 years old. It is mostly multiplication and geometry. And there is an awful board game, where it takes away the very rewards that you won.(I understand that subtraction is part of math, but I think they could have did it another way without it seeming like a punishment.) It just was not fun for my child, everything seemed too much like work.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because of the ability to acess the school house rock music videos and the pool game was okay too. But just okay."
2,It Literally Doesn't Work For Me!!,"I WOULD give this a positive review, except for one teensy tiny problem--this thing is not compatible with my MacBook! I don't remember computer games not being able to work on laptops! Oh well, I got ripped off here. I wasted my money on something where it would not cooperate with my system, so I'm going to have to give this a negative review. The game itself is creative and nostalgic, but I can't play it."
4,woW880,"The title may be a little corny but this phone is great. The size of the phone is smaller then most if not all Sony Ericsson phones and it is definately a thin phone for being a 3G phone. The only downside to the phone is the minor learning curve to using smaller buttons, but that only takes a few days to get used to. Overall, this is a great phone."
1,Breaks easily,"The phone was fine until it broke. I had it repaired at an authorized dealer, it broke again soon. Now I am weary of Sony phones. In contrast, the Nokia N85Nokia N85 Unlocked Phone with 5 MP Camera, 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Copper)that I have landed on concrete about 10 times and continues to function as if nothing happened."
1,Eh,"Got this phone because of its size. Opened the box and was immediately unsatisfied. The phone is cheaply made, the buttons are insanely small. And to top it off, unlike what I was told by various stores, this phone can not be used on AT&T, it doesnt accept the correct signals."
4,Great Gift,"Very soft and warm. A great gift for any Phillies fan, and big enough for the whole family."
4,The colony creative engineering,The Colony was well made quality DVD's had no problem with them. I was very interested in the solutions and creativity demonstrated by the participants.
1,Really?,Super over priced set. Great tv show but you can buy each season for about $12 brand new. Dont buy this!
5,Anything by any of the Horse Flies Flies,"I was starving for new material by members of the Horse Flies, and am so happy about this Boy With A Fish outfit. The sound is all there minus the banjo uke and Richie Stearns' clawhammer banjo style and crooning reedy vocals. I guess I should hold myself back from comparing the two genius musical entities because I just love this run of songs. Thanks Jeff, Judy and band. Hope to catch you at Banjo Jim's in April."
5,armchair astronomy as its best,"If you are fascinated by the sky, get this software now. I wasamazed by the photo realisitic rendition of the sky mapon the PC. Both the Backyard Edition and Pro Edition arewell worth the price. Many a times I do star watchingon my desk, watch the librations of the moon at high speed(see the moon wobbling on its axis by zooming andlocking on the moon and running time at higher speed).Many a day, this is my screen saver, locking on the sunas it cuts thru the zodiac. Yesterday I watched the transitof venus across sun ahead of time on my PC.On my linux, I use xephem (it comes with source code in c),and on dos I use alw.exe (astromony lab) to generate the almanac.And finally pscal.sh to generate the moon phases in myprintable calendar (see google for pscal,xephem,alw.zip).Of course, you can use to identify stars, by using on yourlaptop, when you do star watching.- Mosh http://www.cs.albany.edu/~mosh"
2,NO PINYIN,"I love these books. Really, I do. They have such a WIDE spectrum of topics, areas careers, trades...you name it.The outline of each book is as follows:*pictures of various objects/situations (For example, a ilustration of a lab and various things in the lab numbered, like a beaker, burner, microscope, etc.).*A list next to the ilustration with the forgien word, then the english equivilant underneath.And thats it! It is SO simple to understand, and it is broken down into (Many MANY) sections that are every-day situations that you usually would not get from a standard college-level textbook.Only one problem THIS BOOK HAS NO PINYIN FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT TOO ADVANCED!! I wrote to the editors and they said ""We thank you for your suggestion, but as of this time we have no plans to make a new edition. IF AS MANY PEOPLE WHO READ THIS VOICE YOUR OPINION OF HOW IMPORTANT PINYIN IS TO A STUDENT, WE MAY GET THEM TO INCLUDE IT IN THE NEXT EDITION!! Just e-mail them from the oxford site."
2,Not REALLY Charlie & Lola,"This book is based on the Charlie and Lola TV series and isn't really by Lauren Child. You can tell by the third sentence that it lacks the charm and originality of the other 3 Charlie and Lola books. I was disappointed - however, my three year old doesn't seem to mind nearly as much as I do."
4,"Not as good, but still a great picture book!","I really debated about buying this book for my 3-yr-old daughter. True, she is in love with her 3 other ""Charlie and Lola"" books, as well as ""My Dream Bed""--another wonderful Lauren Child book. Still, when I paged through this book in the bookstore I thought it had too much text on many pages, and overall it is certainly not as charming as ""Tomato"", ""Not Sleepy"", and ""Too small 4 school"".Alas, despite my misgivings, my daughter loves this book so much! We read the book before she saw the corresponding episode of the ""Charlie and Lola'"" show on Playhouse Disney; then when she did see the show, she loved the book even more.I agree with many of the other reviewers that this book is not as good as many of Child's other picture books. However, to a 3-yr-old in love with Charlie and Lola, Lotta, and even imaginary Soren Lorenson, this book is better-loved and more often requested than many other books."
3,beautiful photographs...not so great text....,"This is a badly needed volume, at least to those of us who rememmber the ""stand on the gas and turn left"" days at Indy, when the cars looked like cars and things like aerodynamics and ground effects didn't exist... Some beautiful color photos plus a lot of b/w pics highlight it. The text skips about covering this driver, then that with what seems to be no special order at all....Surprisingly, only one photo of the car that started (more or less) the roadster era, the car driven by the great Bill Vukovich, who had the breaks gone just bit different would have won 4 STRAIGHT Indy 500's...(He had a steering failure which caused a crash just 8 laps from the end of the '52 race, won in '53&'54, suffered a fatal crash running away from the field in '55)However,the other great names of the roadster era are well-represented:Bryan, Ward, Rathmann, Sachs, Jones and of course, Foyt. The price is bit high, but the photos alone make the book worth it...."
4,A joy itself,"This little book was enclosed with a thank you card by a friend. On the left is a work of art, on the right a few comments by Sister Wendy about how joy is expressed in the picture. I spaced them out through my days as a chance for a moment or two of quiet reflection from time to time. Then I slipped it into another thank you card and passed it along to another friend."
3,Three & a half stars... a bit too brief,"It could be argued that this format (what people who knew Pollack say about him later) is the laziest form of biography. But it is quite interesting to read exactly what tales his friends and colleagues can tell us. It was light reading, lacking the kind of sequential factual details a meticulous biographer strings together.Title implies sensationalism rather than a sober study of the man's life; indeed, the book leans a bit too much on gossipy bits of scandal, drinking, violence, and angst. Does nothing to dispel all the galmourization and star attraction of Pollack, which is unfortunate. The book's lack of art criticism does a disservice to the artist, and places Pollack under an unfortunate spotlight of personality. Reader can leave this book erroneously imagining Pollack was a fake, or at least pathetic.Worth reading to augment exhaustive research, but not the full story..."

4,We need more people like this lady,"I am a nurse and just retired from a career with the California Department of Corrections. I enjoyed reading this book. It was sad to know that we do not do more to protect our wildlife. Murderers start out by killing animals, some as young as 2 or 3. I do believe this lady put her life in danger. It is good to know that we have people like her that take the risk to try and stop this wanton killing."
5,A Hunt For Justice,"While this started slow for the first few pages, it grew quickly. Entertaining like an adventure novel, the reader knows this ""stuff"" is for real. It becomes a primer for the trials and tribulations found in covert work. Murphy's Law in action. A real account of most special investigations with spectacular Alaskan terrain and back drops as a bonus. Leaves reader much entertained and informed."
1,Shady,"Do wildlife officers ordinarily hire undercover informants that drink themselves into a stupor day after day in the field? Looks like from the book his early demise from ""organ failure"" was from drinking himself to death. No wonder he couldn't tell whether he was in one river drainage or another.Pretty shady. The last poster is right that she does not know north from south, which is odd since they are never actually very far off the haul road and could see the oil pipeline and the road easily. In fact, Happy Valley is actually on the road itself wheras the book tries to make it sound like it is way off somewhere. The Sag runs parallel right next to the road, and the Ivishak flows right into the Sag.A good book if you live in the city five thousand miles away and don't know up from down."
5,"You, Having A Baby",Outstanding audio book for me as a husband and expecting Father. As a motivational speaker myself [...] I would recommend this book to anyone. Great info from conception to early childhood.
1,same old thing...,There is one very interesting page about epigenetics.The rest is the same old pregnancy crapola. Boring if you've even read one other pregnancy book.
2,Got rid of it,"I would recommend ""Your Pregnancy, Week by Week"" instead. I was really disappointed in ""You, Having a Baby."" The drawings look like they were done by a middle-school boy, it's too silly, and not real enough. I hesitated to take advice about having a baby from two men, and I didn't even end up finish reading the book."
4,Great Book!,"I am really enjoying this book. Easy to navigate and read and packed with good information. I have several books on pregnancy, but this one is my favoriite."
2,"Two guys, no experience","I find it ridiculous that these guys keep churning this stuff out. You on a diet is a decent book. This is an affront, just because you are an expert on one thing, doesn't make you expert on all things.They had no reason except, perhaps, avarice to write this thing."
4,"A great guide, made to be easily understood!","This is a great book for someone considering pregnancy or already in full swing. Lots of information, yet in a format that anyone can understand and look further into if interested! I appreciated the information and presentation, it was light hearted and humorous, yet packed with quality information!"
2,Disjointed,"I'm 1/2 way through this book and I'm getting a bit frustrated. The book skips from medical descriptions of how a baby develops to nutritional facts for pregnant women to how to massage and swaddle your baby. It's hard to tell if a chapter is about fetal development, pregnancy, baby, or all of the above. It jumps all over the place and is not an easy read to be sure. So far there have been a few helpful tips and explanations, but the layout of the book is just not good. Also, there are these strange footnotes that I think are meant to be jokes....however, that is not the tone of the book. I'm really hoping the workout dvd is better since I have already ordered it."
2,Wouldn't recommend to 1st time moms,"I like Dr. Oz and liked ""You On a Diet"" very much (except for the million similes), but after reading a few other pregnancy books, this one really stood out because it lacked a female perspective. The authors are both male physicians, which is fine, but they can't offer personal insight into pregnancy and delivery.They do offer a lot of medical advice, tips, and explain the biology well, but while reading the book, I kept thinking, Maybe they should have brought a female doctor or asked their wives to cowrite the book.I did like the section on vaccinations because I hadn't thought about it much and this gave me a starting point for my own research.Overall, this book does a solid job of explaining the process from a medical standpoint, but it lacks personal FEMALE insight into pregnancy and birth and wouldn't recommend it to first-time moms."
1,Not worth buying!,"I would not recommend this book. The information is generalized and nothing new. I was shocked that Dr Oz would lend his name to such a lame endeavor. I especially hated the way the book was structured. It was highly disorganized and made no sense. The sophomoric cartoon sketches scattered throughout---who was their target audience? It was like they were writing for a high school health class and were trying novel ways to keep a juvenile attention span. The entire book was an insult to my intelligence.There are so many wonderful pregnancy books out there with clear, concise chapters where information is readily accessible. I have many pregnancy-related books from my previous pregnancies and bought this one as an updated version since a few years have passed. I recommend buying any other book besides this one. ""Dr. Oz"" is now just another brand name and a money-making gimmick. This book was horrible!"
5,ORIGINAL,I first read this charming book almost 9 years ago when I was given an early copy of it at age 10. I instantly fell in love with it & you can imagine how disappointed I was when I lost it 6 years ago. I have been searching for it ever since & now I can't even find another copy of it anywhere. I am a young aspiring director & I'm hoping to turn it into a screenplay one day (with the correct permission ofcourse). I don't understand why the title has been changed or why this fabulous story is nolonger being printed. BRING IT BACK!!!!! I sayTake care :O)DOLPHIN!
5,A Masterpiece! One of the Great Literary Works of Our Time!,"This is a MARVELOUS book. Don't be fooled by it's title. This is a masterful work of fantasy literature! It all starts when a small group of children find a small box while on the shores of Greece. Inside the parcel is an eloquent parrot and a sulky spider. The children learn of a mysterious plot in the land of Mythologica where evil cockatrices plan to take control. Along the way, they meet a taslking train, mermaids, griffins, a dragon, and a sea-serpent who wants to be a chef. What's gonna happen next? I just guess you'll have to read it to find out!......too bad it's out of print"
5,The best book I've ever read,"A marvolous book. This book is one I'll treasure always. The book, set in the land of Mytholigia, is about three children who go to help save the land from the reign of the Cocktrice. Many Mthical creatures gather to fight to save the land made to keep there kind from extintion when humans began disbelieving from the Cocktrices which would make the land unhappy for many creatures. Great for fantasy and myth lovers. Overall, this book helps keep myth alive."
5,Ols school training at its best,"I had a specific purpose for this piece of equipment. No other would do, and I could not find it anywhere else. In short, I am a very happy customer."
1,is to hard,"I lost my money because it is so hard that it is impossible to bend. I've always had this method of exercise but nothing worse than this, it is impossible to bend.."
2,Wanted more,"I was expecting more stories about the golfers she encountered, but a large percentage is just plain stuff most golfer's already know, like what a scramble is. I didn't need a review of the game of golf. Although there are a few good nuggets (stories), I was disappointed."
3,BX45,Hooked it up once but no power. Needed sound in vehicle quickly for long trip so have not tried to reinstall yet.
5,Flea Breeze!,"The bargain hunter's dream book...Ms. McCree makes you laugh as she offers well-researched advice on how to find the real deals. A quick, insightful read and a true flea market adventure!!"
2,Not easy to clean,This one could not use water and detergent to clean. The one with Chrome plating was easier to clean.
2,Review of Happy Endings,I was disappointed with the cd because it has only half the number of songs in the movie :(
3,disappointed,"I really loved this movie and a big reason was the music. I was going to buy this cd but then noticed my favorite song wasn't included so I didnt. ""You are the Same"" was the best and I cant find it anywhere."
4,"Has a style, not enough polish...","I really enjoy the flow of the CD, the pieces fit well together. My only complaint, as minor as it may be, was I wanted more from Maggie's songs. The band was very sparse and muted behind her, and it made me struggle to enjoy swaying to the rhythm. If those three tracks had been recorded/mixed a bit better, I'd give this CD a 5. Very unique and fresh. I'd love to hear Maggie sing again."
3,Was expecting more,"The soundtrack doesn't do the movie justic. Maggie G is of course amazing, and her tracks are the bones of the CD. I was hoping for a sequence that reflected the movie's temperment, but what i find instead is a collection of otherwise decent songs, almost haphazardly paired."
3,Happy Endings,"I saw the movie recently and was in love with the sound track . However , this cd contained the worst tracks featured in the movie . disappointing ."
3,Good except for Gyllenhaal's,"I'm sorry, but Maggie Gyllenhaal's singing is just not doing it for me. She comes across as as tinny, not able to fill the acoustic space. The rest of the music is pretty fun and quirky."
5,Beautiful and touching,"this is an absolutely beautiful book, and the essay by Diane Ackerman is captivating and very moving. A very special book."
3,Terrible posed model but that is what you get.,"THis is a crappy pose for this mini and goes not come with the options that are needed to build a brood lord fully. Be ready to convert this one. It is a ok model but by far not the best of that GW could put forth. If you can try and make your own, you will be happier."
5,Great music,This CD is great music. The gospel songs Iris Dement sings are enjoyable. The variety is good. Solid performance by a great artist.
2,Wonderful singing but uninspired guitar/dobro accompanyment,"The best tracks (IMHO) are those with only simple piano accompaniment. They compliment her vocals. However, I find myself skipping past those backed by guitar and dobro. The arrangements are uninspired and boring with no trace of musical imagination. I can only imagine what wonderful sound might be produced by pairing Iris' great vocals with the imagination of a musician of the caliber of, say, Ry Cooder!"
5,LIfeline,"I sent this to my sister during the last days of her fight against breast cancer. She had mentioned how old time hymns ""The ones you know the words to"" brought her a lot of comfort.Iris Dement outdid herself on this one. She left the music scene for awhile and I have missed her music. Maybe a little more upbeat next time out Iris."
2,"Sorry, I can't agree","I have read the good reviews for this CD, and I beg to differ. First, I love Iris' voice, and her music has moved me to tears on several occasions. But this was simply a yawn-o-rama from beginning to end. The performances were flat and formulized, and some of the songs dragged out so long that I found myself checking my watch. There were a couple of moments of true joy...but only a couple, so I will add one star for that.After more than 5 years of writer's block, this is the best she can do? Maybe her marriage to Greg Brown will give her creativity the kick in the slats it needs.Although I am disappointed, I plan to give it several more listens...maybe I just don't ""get it"" yet."
2,Not her best effort,"I love Iris, her voice and most of her work up to date, but didn't enjoy this at all. Don't get me wrong, I really like Gospel songs, and some of these are among my favourites, but I kinda felt that there wasn't a lot of conviction in her singing. She sounded a bit bored by the whole thing. I feel Gospel songs are best sung by people with conviction and I'm afraid there isn't any here with Iris,IMHO. It rings a bit hollow, but that's only my opinion. You might think it's the best thing since sliced bread"
1,Verrry disappointing album from a wonderful singer.,"Iris has picked several lovely old (and new) hymns for this album, but a curious choice of singing style damages it beyond redemption. She chooses to use a reedy, warbling, quavery tone that distracts from the music - making it almost unlistenable. This is not her normal singing voice, which surfaces momentarily on the record, so why she would choose this style is a mystery. I hope she'll see the error of this album and go back to her usual voice on subsequent cds."
2,Manipulative,"Sorry but in my opinion I don't believe Iris really believes in what she is singing. There is a tremendous market for gospel music and many entertainers try to capitalize on the demand to make money.Yes, even folksy singers who would certainly never admit it can be closet capitalists. Not that I'm against capitalism--I just prefer authentic artists."
5,"Iris means every word, every note.","The songs on Lifeline are just that, a lifeline out of sorrow and despair. These are heartfelt renditions that take repeated listenings before you tune into their emotional resonance. They may not have an immediate appeal, even to devoted Iris fans, but once you let them get inside you, you will be glad you did.Iris always surprises. Every album is different from the last, none more so than this, her latest. Her voice remains unique and very special. The accompaniments on this album are appropriately sparse, yet virtuoso. The songs are Gospel in theme and content, folksy in style and spirit, and Blues in their cathartic power. If you are an Iris fan, give this album a fair hearing before judging it. If you are new to her, start instead with Infamous Angel, to fall in love with her voice, then work your way up to Lifeline."
2,Ewwww,"I understand that Iris DeMent has a very strong fan base and that this review will likely ruffle a few feathers, but...Ewww! I am sorry, but I just don't get it. I find her voice grating and somewhat irritating. The album itself has many songs that would otherwise be quite lovely, but with her vocals I just can not get into it."
3,so so,"I purchased a used copy so I wasn't expecting it to be in mint condition, but this copy had highlights and wrinkles on most of the pages, which was not revealed in the description."
4,I Like it!,"This book has helpd me with different needle tec, moxa, points and channels. I was lucky to get this book in my 1st year and although some of the information was ahead of where i was at, it has grown with me over the last 2yrs. I found it was good explaing the different depths needles are used at and why, when to moxa points, how long for and the number of cones you may use, how some points are not to be used for different stages in life and the needle sensation one may get!This book walked into my life at the right time! it has kept me going and remindes me why i love this line of healing! I think it helps anyone who is starting out and it will grow with you and you will find as you learn more so this book will suport you as you grow!!"
4,Inspirational baseball film,My daughter (a baseball fan) loved this movie. It's inspirational and emotional. If you have a young sports fan in your family this movie is a great choice. Not sure why I hadn't heard about it before. It's not as funny as sandlot-more along the lines of Rudy.
5,Great movie,"This is a great movie, especially if you are a baseball fan. I would recommend it to anyone, though, even if you are not big on baseball or sports. It's an inspirational story and a nice reminder of the joy you can get from helping others and what you can achieve if you want something badly enough and are willing to put in the effort."
4,Baseball story from the past,"Engaging tale about a group of boys from Mexico led by a former ... member of a Major League Baseball team win their way to the Little League World Series. Cheech Marin plays a priest along for the ride and Lou Gosset Jr. appears as a former Negro League player, didn't he play in a movie about the Negro Leagues? Nice tie-in.Tells the boys to fullfill their destiny. A good one."
4,perfect game,"Great Movie,Brand new like they said it would be. I remember when this boys came to my town to play ball.felt good seeing the movie and remembering those days of being young."
3,okay,"I had hopes for this film but it turned out to be a bit disjointed and not engaging. At best, it's an average film."
5,Nice powerful and quiet pump motor,Replaced motor on Hayward Super II Pump with the ST1202 and it works GREAT! I did not want to use any off-brands which were typically more expensive (at least in local pool stores) and don't last as long. My neighbor bought an off-brand Hayward pool pump motor and it only lasted him 1 year. A.O. Smith is the best and it is the original equipment manufacturer for Hayward pool pumps.
1,men's studies as travelogue,"This book could have been called ""In Search of Male America."" The writer is a free-lance author who hunts around the country to see what men are doing and why. It has diverse chapters, essays on cosmetic surgery, gun lovers, leathermen, etc. Unfortunately, it's descriptive, rather than analytical, and just feels like pages upon pages of ""yak, yak, yak."" The author tries to be funny often and usually fails. I am glad that even journalists are starting to show an interest in men's studies. However, this texts leaves much to be desired. Highly unrecommended."
5,Finally something really groundbreaking in the HR field,"This book is just tremendous. Just reading the first chapter made me begin to rethink all of my old assumptions about how to create competitive advantage through people. Van Adelsberg and Trolley have written a book that is easy to read, provocative in its point of view, results-oriented, and supported by great case studies. I think that it will make a huge difference for companies that truly want to get leverage from their learning and development efforts. Bravo!"
3,A Solid Effort!,"David van Adelsberg and Edward A. Trolley are experts in developing innovative workplace learning solutions, in other words, training. Their book presents their program, ""Running Training Like a Business."" This book is enormously detailed, if jargon-heavy and somewhat bureaucratic in its language. It is filled with flow charts, graphs, and other visuals that will appeal to anyone who wants thorough strategies that can improve training programs. We [...] recommend this book to executives who design, oversee, coordinate, or purchase employee training and education programs. One caveat: the reader does get some sense that, with this volume, the authors are also marketing their program to potential clients."
2,Don't Do It...,"I bought this on accident. I thought I was buying the TRIIgame, so I just want to make sure you don't make the same mistake. Itdoes contain 3 levels from the real TRII game, but not with all functions that the game offers. ie, video clips. If you are looking for something to cheaply show you how TRII works, then buy it. But if you are going to spend the money, you might as well just buy the real game and truly enjoy your purchase. END"
4,Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"What can I say this is a fun demo. This contains the first 3 levels from the game and comes with tomb raider 3 demo final fantasy 7 and many more. This game does not have the tutorial cutscenes and options but it has the secrets and weapons of the real game. I give this four stars because it doesn't have options cut-scenes and others but thats okay it is still fun. By the way you cannot download these three levels online, only a bit of the first."
4,A very good memoir..,"I thought, sometimes, that this memoir got long winded--but I stuck with it and finished it. I think the beginning and the end were the best parts of this book. I had picked up this book years ago--got rid of it, I believe, and not too long ago bought it on Amazon's Marketplace. I have also looked up the author on google and found out that Joie has a web page..that offers support to people that have port wine stains--as she does."
5,"its better than bad, its good","Neil Gaiman manages to spin together an excellent web using his ""death"" character from his Sandman series. The hook: Death isn't a morbid spectre, but a perky and likeable goth chick. Every century, she gets the chance to spend one day on Earth, the better to explore humanity from the other side of the black veil. The story of how she spends her day is interesting and uplifting, casual and sort of realistic. The other main character, Sexton, is someone you can really sympathize with. This is really a quirky and interesting book, and aside from the wonderful story you can revel in Chris Bachalo's beautiful artwork, which blends beautifully with Neils words. Basically, this book is tons of fun and you can read again and again. Gaiman or comic fans should definately pick this up."
2,Snooze fest,"I love a lot of Gaiman's stuff, but this is really bad. No action at all, almost no ""magic"", a completely unlikable supporting character, and supposedly touching ending. It's really short, and besides a witty line or two there's just nothing there. It's not like I have to have muscle popping heroes in leotards, to enjoy a graphic novel but this is just really good stuff to fall asleep to. Try anything by Alan Moore or Warren Ellis instead."
3,something of a sweet girl,"Death is really a sweetheart. Gaiman did great portraying her in the way he did. Now, I wasn't a huge fan of this book, though I like the characters. It's not a bad story, but just didn't leap out at me the way that Gaiman's work usually does."
4,""" I'm Death. ""","Heh. Making the embodiment of death a slightly crazy and sweet Goth chick; the only thing that equals here is Pratchett's Death. (Who wants to see a crossover? ^_^) And here she gets her own outing, and what an outing it is! All I'll say is that it is fun and leave with this: ""It would be nice if Death was like Didi... someone funny, and friendly, and maybe a little crazy.""Or brooding, protective and slightly confused by humanity like Pratchett's version but hey; either works for me."
5,Makes a Great Gift,"I ordered this as a gift for someone who loves frogs. It is very nice in person. It seemed to run a little big and on the long side though. Other than that, it's a great shirt. After she opened her gifts, I left the room for a few minutes. When I came back, she already had the shirt on. =)"
3,Needs Something,"The book text to me is rather boring explaining the obvious in the wonderful pictures it does include. However, I feel the book could have made even more use of photographs. The book does have wonderful pictures, but really didn't leave me with any ideas I could use. My partially biased opinion is based on the fact that I was looking for remodeling ideas for powerboats, and this book does tend to focus more on sailing yachts. My boating library could do with or without this one."
1,doesn't fit!,"I ordered the rain canopy for my new double summit 360 baby jogger stroller. After several minutes of trying to fit the plastic cover over the stroller, I re-checked the rain canopy instruction sheet to find that it only fits 2004/2005 stroller models. A huge waste of time, and now I have to wait for the CORRECT canopy to fit current models."
1,Starry Night Enthusiast,"Not what I was looking for. Limiting magnitude would not allow the display of faint and deep space objects in a wide sky view. When I tried to return the software (web site guarantees 100% satisfaction or your money back) the company wouldn't take it back. They also said I couldn't sell the program because I had agreed to their stipulations when I loaded the program. If you want anything more than a simple astronomy program for naked eye observing, go with Red Shift. It gives you better control overall, and the parent company for Starry Night isn't at all customer friendly. I feel like I was taken."
1,Brush broke off and net tore during 2nd use,"Don't buy if you have anything but light duty intended. This is not heavy duty by any stretch of the imagination.Too bad, had high hopes."
2,Poor Quality,"This skimmer worked great until the pole adapter came out of the basket extension. It was pop riveted in place with one rivet and poorly at that. It appears to have been designed for two rivets because there is a depression in the adapter that appears to be for locating a drill hole and a corresponding hole in the basket extension. However, only one place was drilled and only one rivet installed."
1,Ripped,Very disappointing. Had it for 2 months and it ripped while scooping leaves. Went to get it replaced and found out it was not eligible after such a short time.
3,fast delivery,Did the trick. Nice quality and it fit perfectly. Would never have been able to close the pool without it
4,Good pool rake,"I've always owned aluminum-framed pool rakes. This rake is molded in plastic and definitely feels stronger, but also seems to be a little heavier. I do have to mention that because the edges of the rake are wide, it drags in the water more than the aluminum rakes. I can put up with it as long as it last longer than the last aluminum rake I bought 6 months ago."
3,deep bag,It wouldn't fit any poll I had so I duct taped it to the one I had. Other then that it work OK.
1,Wont buy again.,"poor quality. the net tore with first use. Used first time, picks up leaves but after first use i saw the net is already broken. Also the net is just glued to the frame. very poor design."
3,Pool equipment,"This is not nearly as big as I though it would be, but it does do the job. Seems to be made well enough to last a while"
1,broke within 5 mins,I used this item once and it broke within 5 mins of me trying to scoop leaves out of pool. POOR quality
2,Nice concept but disappointing,"The idea of a scooping pool rake sounded great since we have a lot of leaves in our pool every winter. Unfortunately, our regular pool rake gets the leaves better off the bottom than this supposedly professional rake. I had hoped this would make my work easier but it just doesn't. In fact, it is a bit more difficult to handle as a regular rake so I am not using it. Too bad."
5,Koi Pond,I have a lot of trees around my Koi Pond. This pool rake makes it easier to scoop out the leaves.
5,works well,This came in a timely manner and does the job intended for it's use. It also fit onto our existing pole just fine.
2,"Would have returned if it wasn't such a hassle,","Thought was was a great buy when we got it. Less than 10 uses after purchase both of the rivets holding the net to part that attaches to the pole gave out. Instead of going through the hassle of a return, I used two drywall screws and screwed it into place. So far so good. The net part of this product works great and the balance of the net is also good. My guess is that I got a bogus net (as they are all most likely made in China.)"
1,poor quality!,This pool rake is NOT professional or heavy duty as described! Used it once and net ripped. Very poor quality! Sending back!
2,Broke the first time I used it.,"Pretty much a standard leaf rake, but there is nothing heavy duty about it. It would be fine for light duty, but if you are scooping up a large amount of leaf debris from the bottom of the pool go get something heavier."
2,Net works when it stays in the pole,"Just tried out this product. The net works great, but several times the net would pop out of the pole when I placed the net on the floor of the pool to pick up debris. The net fits fine in the pole and seems to snap into place, but gets loose with any pressure applied. Going to contact the seller to see about this issue."
5,Pool skimmer,Great product works well. I've used a few of these skimmers and this one stands up well to all of them.
4,Swimline HD deep bag rake,"This product works great for getting all the trash and stuff up off the bottom. Also fits the pole that came with my vacuum , so really works out good for me. Very well made should last longer than those bought at ,wally world."
5,Gets very heavy quickly...,This saved me a lot of time in scooping leaves from the bottom of the pool. The only downside is that it gets heavy very quickly with waterlogged leaves - so it's ability to hold leaves is basically limited by your arm strength.
2,"Looks good, but...","Product manufacturing quality is good but the frame and lip design and bag depth is lacking.The hard plastic frame presents more resistance that expected when scooping leaves and debris from the surface. The width and angle on the sides makes it hard to get close enough to the tile line to get those clinging leaves.The worst design defect is the combination of an inefficient angle on the front lip and the bag depth. The angle doesn't allow leaves and debris to slide into the bag easily but rather slip under the lip (staying in the pool). If you extend very far, the depth of the bag is just about equal the height of the frame opening - meaning what you have already scooped into the bag floats out. So you start all over.I would not recommend this."
4,"Good Bag but no 100% Sure About the ""Heavy Duty""",My pool is a disaster. Who ever built it made it a cleaning nightmare. I go through a skimmer every year. I am thinking this is a heavy duty bag for nylon pools - not plaster. The plastic is OK density and it hasn't broken yet! BUT it also hasn't made it thru an Arizona summer. I have my fingers crossed that this will last - but I am guessing that AZ Heavy Duty is way different than what most pool companies think.
4,good product,"the product is okay for the price, been looking for a product like this for some time, happy that i already found it."
5,"Sturdy, high capacity pool rake","This rake is reinforced on the frame, and the bag is not kidding in being listed as deep. The design allows it to get the major stuff off the bottom in minutes, and the opening size allows you to use it as a course skimmer (if you are not a fan of changing tools.) I was skeptical of the item when I saw the online cost, after seeing this in a local store for $45.00. This is a great item, and the frame is more substantial than any our local stores carry."
2,Homeowner,The front part of rake does not scrape bottom of pool like my previous rake. I've gone back to using my old rake despite the fact that it's torn. The old one does a better job.
2,"Dropped it, broke it.","Broke the plastic frame the first day. Pretty unimpressive for something touted as heavy-duty. I'm back to look for something by a different company, preferably with a metal frame."
1,She's no Mother Teresa.,"This book is low on facts and high on the catholic party line.David Scott presents his enemies in wrong and unflattering ways. On page 48, Scott writes, ""...the century when Darwin announced his ""discovery"" that man descended from apes:..."" Darwin used his brain and proposed a theory to explain things. Scott tries to inject mystical meaning to mundane things; he makes a big deal about how little we know of Mother Teresa's life before she became a nun. Scott mentions Mother Teresa's critic's but misrepresents their positions and dismisses them as unimportant. Surprisingly, Scott admits that Mother Teresa took big money from unsavory donors, and that she secretly performed unrequested deathbed baptisms.Despite his sub-title, The Meaning of Mother Teresa, David Scott does not offer us any data to use to evaluate or to understand Mother Teresa. This is not a good biography, it is not even a good public relations document."
1,this book was terrible,"This work by Dr. Wilber was pretty awful. He has a terribly boring writing style and the pages of his book are filled with superfluous material. Also, the ending of the book was just pathetic! Then again, the beginning and the middle were also pathetic. Don't waste your money or your time investing in this literary trash."
1,The print is Impossible,"I ordered this Bible, and was expecting a 'sorta' smaller edition of their large, lumbering, cumbersome Sword Study Bible. What I got was a Bible that I immediately returned because the print was so tiny that it was impossible to read.'Nuff said."
3,Not what I'd hoped it to be,"Being a big Whiskeytown and Jayhawk fan I was looking forward to a tastey little treat. Cary comes in loud and clear but the rest of the band and guests don't ever get a chance to shine. Cary has a nice voice and all but if you are going to have Mary Chapin Carpenter harmonize on a few songs, we'd like to be able to hear her. Same goes for Jen Gunderman. Who does'nt want more Jen? On the postive side, the song writing is strong and the overall sound is pleasing to the ear. It's just not a CD that I will wear out. Throw in some instrumental solos, turn up the mix on the harmonizing parts, and then we can talk. Maybe less Cary is actually more."
3,Pretty for the price,"The earrings are very nice for the price. However, after 9 months of regular use, one of the pearls had fallen off of the backing."
5,Loving Those Squirrels!,"I do squirrel rescue/rehab and have read a lot of books; this is one of the best. Mallery gives a lot of information about squirrel lifestyle, history, trivia and ideas for facilitating squirrel/bird yard-sharing, all in a way that will make make you laugh as much as the squirrels do. There are even recipes for treats. Information AND entertainment!"
5,A delightful little gem,"Luscious and delectable is the best way to describe this wonderful little book. It is lighthearted,joyous and full of sensually gratifying ""exercises"" to stimulate every woman to deeply experience the full enjoyment of all of her senses. Lucky is the woman who buys this book and luckier still the man who makes a present of it to her!"
3,Entertaining,"This book is entertaining and an easy read, but I didn't rate it higher because it has way too many spells, too many things to go out of your way to get in specialty stores, and too many scents and colors that you need to remember what they are good for. If you are not into the spells part (and I am not) and you just concentrate on the story at the end of each chapter for each night of the week and the energy of the specific Goddess for each day, it is interesting, but then there's no need to read half the book."
2,Disappointing,"I'm sure this book will be useful to someone. However I found the set up of it to be disjointed at times. The transistions between ideas within each chapter was not smooth at all. Your typical, new age, mindless step by step spell book. It was a bit too feminist for me. It seemed to try to touch on many key issues without going into them in any real, useful depth. There were some beautiful stories, with a few clever ideas, but nothing substantial. I was disappointed."
2,misleading,The pic and info lead me to believe i was ordering two pounds of keys not just one key. Its a fine key but only one. Beware there are a lot cheaper single keys
1,Can't get into the Learning Kingdom!!!!!!!,"We are sooo disappointed. Do not get this game. While it has good learning activities in the end it was horribly disappointing. You have to work through all four levels of all four sections in order to unlock the learning kingdom. For a young child it was hard to get all the way to the end ""reward"" My son was really excited to get to the end and unlock the Learning Kingdom. So we worked on it together. Spending far more time than I would have liked and then....you get to the gate, unlock it and........nothing happens. You don't actually get to go into the kingdom. The characters just stand there at the gate and then you go back to the beginning. My son is still trying to figure out why after all that it still isn't working. I'm so mad I could spit. I tried to send a message to the company to complain but no luck. Instead I thought I'd give a review at least."
4,Reasonable Learning Software,"Re-purchased this as a replacement for a scratched up original. Kids really like it, catch tunes."
4,Great Case,"Looks great and the outside is made of a plastic that looks like leather but doesn't scratch as easily. See crumpler website for exactly what it is made of. Fits my 15in macbook pro nicely, snug on top, and closes tightly. Slides slightly when in case, but I don't think anything of it. Fits well in my bag I carry it in. The case semi-hard...feels like a tough piece of cardboard inside. Keeps the heat from coming through, so it's a plus when your laptop gets hot on your lap.Happy customer."
4,nice sleeve,"it's a nice sleeve.it's of a high quality.but i thought it was tougher on the outside.(not to say that it isn't, just not as i thought it would be)it fits a macbook 13"" very nicely.all and all, it's recommended."
5,reeally good!!!,"I loved this book: the way it's written, the story (not really a fairy tale and not the usual happy end),the characters and... the suspense! I couldn't put it down. Since I really had a good time reading this book, I hope this author will come soon with more..."
5,LA Fition At Its best,"Bruce Wagner meets Raymond Chandler. A great novel, it's too bad it will remain obscure. Some of the best writing about LA and sharp observations about the kind of people who live there."
5,THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ,"I thought I was a web genius until I read this book. It is absolutely amazing. The author Anne, even responded to a question I had within the hour by email. If you want to build a succesfull website you have to get this book."
3,it was okay,I felt that the book was decently written.I wouldnt say that it is the best Star trek book out there though but in my opinion it was worth reading.
4,FAIRLY TYPICAL EARLY STAR TREK VENTURE,"Star Trek #12 is an enjoyable read that can be read in a couple sittings at best, the later book have more pages and somewhat deeper plots. Some of the other reviews here give synopsis of the plot so I will refrain from that.I found 'The Speaker of Hyla', or Lorelei, to be a very interesting character, as did Captain James Kirk early on. Until her methodology and beliefs takes his ship away from him in mutiny!As can be seen from several other reviews, the plot is fairly simple, but the writing and action are enjoyable. And with Kirk being a romantic of sorts, he is taken in more so than either McCoy or Spock. All's well in the end and it is an early Star Trek tale told well. One can almost see this as a screen play to be viewed on TV.Live long and read many Star Treks.Semper Fi."
3,Eh...,"This was a predictable Trek novel. While some of the character were fun, it seemed a little too easy to figure out the plot."
4,Mowlana Rumi in Context,"Professor Schimmel has done us all a great service with this book. It places Mowlana in the context of his society, Islam, and of course Sufi. Such a relief from some of the popular books which present such a 2-dimensional view of Mowlana."
5,memories,When I was but a wee lad I had one thing on my mind... treasure cove! I've never had more fun!!!(all so look in to millie's math house)
5,Most Unappreciated,"I saw this film once when I was 12 years old in the sixties. Nevertheless, I remember it like it was yesterday. The concept, the special effects (simple but very effective) and the conclusion are first rate. It is really the one Corman film that should be widely available on DVD format. Hopefully someone will realize this and get it released."
1,Don't waste your $$$,"Despite the nice title of the book, it is not worth a $105.00. The decision making models are overviews and are very brief. This book lacks numeracy. The case studies in my opinion are underdeveloped. The author spends time talking about strategic partnerships and the need for venture portfolio companies, to develop them, but he doesn't provide any examples of those that worked. There is some information to be gleaned from this book, but if you can get it for under $30, then buy it. Otherwise at $105, you will be very disappointed. This book is totally overpriced. If I could photocopy it and return it, I would have."
5,The Complete Works of Derek Dingle,The book came in great condition and the price was good. I buy a lot of used books from Amazon and I have never been disappointed.
4,Great jazz piano,"Vince Guaraldi was a great pianist who tragically passed away in 1976. ""Linus and Lucy"" is probably his most famous and probably most peolpe's favorite. The drums and bass in his band help add great sound and beat to the music. If you like piano jazz this is for you."
3,bright and bold quilt patterns,"Very bright and bold but with precise instructions for varying shapes and sizes of beadspreads, and incredibly simplistic.15 quilts with a flat photograph of each displayed, and full-size templates for ease of copying.The patterns cover fish, snakes, princesses, clowns and more - and taste comes into play. Nothing tonal or subdued here, all is bright primaries and contrasting fluroescent colours.Depending on taste, it could appeal. The simple block patterns are easy enough to employ if you would like to start a child making one of these quilts, perhaps in the classroom.All instructions are very detailed and concisely explained.I wasn't particularly drawn to the quilts myself for my child, but perhaps others are and will be. Recommend library borrowing before purchasing this book, that one might not be disappointed.Happy Quilting!kotori ojadis@yahoo.com"
3,Great but repetitious,"This book is great but I found the patterns to be repetitious. As shown on the cover, you can replace the fish with creepy crawlies, different animals, etc. The book gives you the template tracers you need to draw the animals/people. Only wish there was a bit more creativity, but I guess thats what being creative is for."
5,Multi-Cultural Chill-out,"This is one of those albums that turns out to be even better than you thought it would be. Not only is there not a bad song in the set, the mood it creates is really great. I have used this for everything from unwinding after work, dinner with friends and it's also ideal for bedroom listening, if you know what I mean. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants tastefullly done chill/lounge music."
3,"not really ""lounge"" per se","This is a great new age, instrumental music disc but not really ""lounge"" per se according to the popular definition set by such things as Hotel Costes, Paris Lounge or Buddha Bar series.FYI."
3,There are better volumes in this series,"This is my least favorite of the extensive Buddha Lounge series. It just doesn't have the same range of sounds as the others; there's a more ""generic"" feel to this one. Kind of a mixed bag. If you're new to Buddha Lounge, start with another volume."
2,what was I thinking?,"With so much instrumentation in global music, why laaaaaaaaay on that synthesizer? Track 10 was the only cut worth anything."
4,Very good book for novice investors,"While some of the information in this book is outdated, it gives the new investor some good knowledge to build on."
4,Kids table & chairs,"I love this wooden table and chair set for my grandkids, just what I had been looking for! I really appreciate the fact that the table and chairs are heavy and sturdy, and should last for years through all the grandkids. The chairs are even sturdy enough to even hold ""Opa"" who weighs 215 pounds!The set was easy to put together and my husband's only complaint was the poor quality of the screws. We went to our local hardware store and bought better quality screws.The only reason I gave this set four stars instead of five was because I felt it should have come with four chairs instead of only two (we had to buy a set of two additional chairs) and the poor quality of the screws."
2,poor workmanship,"I wish I would have read all the reviews before I bought this table. Both of the chairs had to be repaired. The wood was split where they were put together. The top of the table looks like the stain has been sprayed on and has dry spots. I am very disappointed, but didn't feel like spending the extra money to send it back. I just paid someone to fix the chairs. For this kind of money I would have expected better quality."
3,Chairs are Great - Table is Wobbly,"Fit and finish were good. The chairs are very sturdy. The wood is a bit soft, but for the price it is OK. My problem is with the legs, which were wobbly. The screws that hold the legs on go into a wood block, and if they are tightened enough to make the joint fast they start to strip out of the wood. Finally, had to go to the hardware store and get long carriage bolts that went through the support block and bolted behind it. Lucky we are mechanically inclined."
4,Get better screws,The screws for the chairs are fine. The table screws are 100% garbage. Do not ruin a nice Product by attempting to install these. I am in the construction trades and have the right tools. These screws are not to be used. Lowes has them in the 2 pack bags. Take them and match up a set. You will need 8 total.
2,poor quality,The legs don't align properly when the table top and legs are screwed together. The stain/paint is peeling off after having it for a month. The wood is very soft. Not worth the money.
1,Poor Quality - Bad Hardware - Not Beechwood,"The product is heavy duty, but the screws are very poor quality and the phillips heads strip easily. One chair bottom had a crack. It is falsely described as ""beechwood"", which is particularly annoying. It is the typical southeast asian ""rubber tree"" wood."
2,Try a different table. Poor quality,"Poor quality, screws are a joke, came with dents in the wood. Should of returned it. Opened on Christmas Eve, to late to return"
3,Need to be handy for this item,"The table and chairs had no damage but the legs didn't fit square and the screws didn't go in all the way so two of the legs were wobbly. We were able to tweek them to fit but only because my husband is handy with wood and tools. Once the leg issue was fixed, the set was awsome. The picture even looks like the legs were crooked but I just thought it was the angle of the picture. The desk did, in fact, look like this when it was assembled before we adjusted it."
5,Child's Rectangular Table with Shelves,"This is a very nice table for the price. I had my handy man assemble it so I can't speak directly to assembly but he didn't have any problem putting it together. I really like the size of the table and the shelves underneath the table top. I am sure my grand daughter will love this table! Good quality for the price, very sturdy!"
2,bad quality,"even after tightening all screw, the chair and table are still not stable. Bad furnish on the surface. Generally speaking, low quality product. Not worth the money."
4,Beautiful table BUT....,"The good: the wood is gorgeous and it is a perfect size for my almost 2yr old to grow into.The bad: it would be a whole lot sturdier IF the top screw holes on each of the table legs was deep enough for the screws to fit all the way into.My husband is very disappointed about the construction, even though it was easy to put together."
5,Great Motivation,"This book was in great condition to be ""used"" it was like new. The book came quickly in the mail and i was excited to get started. This book is a great tool toward dealing with the ""issues"" of control when trying to diet and exercise. Quick read for about 15 minutes every morning to keep you going all day. I put the verses and motivation quotes on index cards and carry them with me. GREAT BOOK!!!!"
2,"Motivation, Encouragement & Inspiration","My book shipped on 10/21/09, & I just recieved my book today 10/31/09. I don't understand why it took so long to arrive when I had also ordered another book from another seller the day after I ordered this one, & it arrived in only 4 days. But my real disappointment was when I opened the package. This book was stated as new & unread. And this may be true, that the book had not been read, but the front & back cover are dirty. And I am unable to remove with marks. The front of the book, also has dents on the corners.It does not look New. I will not be giving this book as a gift as I had planned. I will not purchase from this seller again."
5,Great book to get you focused on the RIGHT parts of proper nutrition and exercise,"I love that this book focuses on making you healthier by leading you to the only One who can do that. It doesn't teach 'self-love' like so many books do. (Since self-love is as fickle as any other type of human love is!) It causes one to be accepting of what we can't change (or in many cases SHOULDN'T change) and to throw ourselves whole-heartedly into changing those things we should! A must for those who are tired of dieting and want to start living in a healthy, consistent manner. :)"
5,A good place to start.,"I am on day 25 out of 40. This Devotional book not only incorporates scripture but different versions and it encourages you to do your own study on the scripture as well. It is a full personal development program. It has sections for journalism, scripture, notes, goals, and so much more. It actually makes you think and helps you to keep God in your fitness journey. I will do this again next year sometime to see how far I have come. It is definitely a great place to start with any health and fitness journey. The author makes many great points and leads you through prayers and exercises to help you keep God in your journey."
5,Great motivational book,"If you are trying to be healthy and believe you need divine intervention to make this happen, this book will be a helpful guide. It is an easy read and highly motivating. Even without a structured diet plan, the discipline techniques presented will help improve your health. I have read a lot of health motivational books, and this is my favorite."
5,Great Frosty the Snoman book!,"I use this book with kids in the classroom. The book is big so it's easy to present for the little ones to see. The pictures are very true to the lyrics, and there is even the printed sheet music with chords on the front and back inside covers."
4,just what i was looking for,"My children loved this book. We especially liked the lyrics and pictures and how they went hand-in-hand. Just what I was looking for, but now I'm looking for a board book version."
2,Toddler doesn't like it,"My 20 month old son loves books, but not this one. When I try to read it. He shouts NO! Maybe he is just too young for it. However, he loves ""Jingle Bells"" by Veronica Vaslenko"
5,Work Great!,"These are the way to go. Takes just enough steel off to get you cutting again with out wearing out your blade too fast like those big machines do! Why suffer, stop and tune up your blade once and awhile and you will be suprised at how much more fun using a chainsaw can be! It a guy thing I guess! Remember safety first!"
5,Oregon Makes Good Chainsaw Accessories,"Have used these on my Husky chainsaw now 10 years to hand sharpen with a Dremel multispeed tool and Dremel chainsaw attachment. They do the job in 3 quick passes on each cut head of the chain. And if a chain saw is dull, then you don't need it!!! Good product that lasts longer than the knockoffs now available."
1,Tooth Fairy pillow---get Real,This was the biggest waste of money. The picture has enhanced the product 10 times. Basically the whole kit fits in the palm of your hand. Too little. Need magnifying glass to read the journal and write like a mouse to put an entry in it. I would NOT recommend to others.
1,"didn't expect it to be so small, am returning item",Did not expect it to be so small. Not what I had in mind for my granddaughters. Will be returning item.
5,G,"It really gives a good clean without having to pull out the rubber flap, it also works well for vases, strong bristles"
4,Good Time Piece,A good hardy time piece that will take somewhat of a beating and keep ticking.. and still not a timex.. highly recommended watch for those who are adventours.
1,Not So Free Stuff,"If you are smart enough to find the Amazon site and can use your browser to search on the web, this book is a waste of money. If my wife had not highlighted some items, I would return the book ASAP.."
5,SOJOE Fire Ring,"After much research, my husband and I ordered this fire ring just before Christmas, hoping we would receive it in time to use on Christmas Eve. It did arrived in time and boy was it a hit. Our guests are still talking about how it made their night. It made our New Years too! It has a deep bowl which really allows you to burn enough wood so you don't have to tend it too often. We love it, as do our neighbors! If you're wondering if it's worth the money, it sure is."
3,Not bad but a bit tight,"I liked this bag although I rarely use it because it is just a bit too small. The model up is too big.I ended up cutting the flap that covers the top and sides off carefully. This flap just got in the way and drove me nuts and made getting the zipper open a real pain. With the flap cut off and the waist straps cut off or removed the bag is almost perfect. I may try looking at the size up.I must have bought 4 camera bags and still don't have the right one. I hate carrying stuff but it is obviously inevitable. I tried a bum bag but that is irritating too, although OK for short walks.I am off to Machu Picchu on a 4 day trek in September so I really need to get this right."
4,Intelligent design,"While I wish the pack was a little more inclined to protect my camera from the elements, it lives up to my wish of being an intelligent little thing. The sling idea is helpful and I've used it a few times already. One thing I would suggest would be to get a bigger pack, the one I got is full and I don't even own that much photo equipment. Besides it is so compact I hardly thing getting a bigger one can have any drawbacks."
5,Practical,"Greetings. I purchased this item with a pre-known info. I have a friend that uses one and he is very happy with it. I purchased one and I also very happy with it. It has room for a full size camera with a lens and two pockets for two lenses or one lens in one pocket with accesories in the other pocket. Seems very small but once in use it does not seem that small. The only drawback I found out is the shoulder belt holder needs a little more padding. I got one of those 'fake lamb' skin accesory for a car seat belt and it works wonders. The sling has pockets all over the place for memory cards, batteries, release attachments (cable release if you use a film camera). Any person will be happy using this sling bag."
4,"Like the style, but could use better organization for filters","Love this bag because:-its easy to access the camera-adjustable compartments in the main section-Plenty of cushioning for the camera and lens (tested when I slipped and fell backwards on the bag)-unique design, not your traditional camera bagdownsides:-The outer pocket organization is odd, pockets good for a cellphone, but not good for cables and screw-on or slide-in filters-Outer pocket has a lot of room, but the organization pockets are fixed and small so you end up filling it w/ random stuff (and becoming very dis-organized)-No strap for tripod (I have a Zipshot and I wrap it around the handle, but then it becomes just slightly bulky so I might knocked down stuff in a gift shop, prefer a strap that I can use to attach the tripod vertically)"
4,Excellent Pack for camaera and gear,"This is an excellent small pack for Digital SLR, lenses and accessories. I appreciate that I can fit everything into it and still have room to carry keys and a wallet without having to bring a purse. I can open it and retreive items without dropping or loosing everything. Light and comfortable."
3,Tamrac 5767 Sling Pack,"Unfortunately this product was too small for my needs, and had to be returned.Thanks for the speedy refund.Fred Griffing"
1,It's okay if you don't mind bleeding fingers,"Seriously, this is a cheap DSLR bag - cheaply designed and made anyway.I bought this for my recent trip to Asia. I wish I had bought a different brand (which commands higher price, but with very plush interior).The major issue with this Tamrac bag is that the interior is so rough and crude, it's a major pain to grab anything you might store inside.I had at least 3 fingers with bandaids when I was traveling with this bag, it was ridiculous!I finally got home and smoothened the rough edges of the velcro straps inside.Seriously, this bag should not be rated higher than 3, especially if you use it a lot."
4,It's nice,"I'm not really serious about pictures, I just like having my camera (Rebel xTi) and two lenses (50-300, and kit lens) in one bag with all the other acessories. It's comfortable, but it doesn't feel all that secure on my back, like it would fall off with lateral movement. I may have been better off with a small backpack. Camera is very easy to get out of the bag, does what it describes, just not as I expected"
2,Smaller than what I spected,"Seems to be nice, but is smaller than what seems. The camera hardly fits in it. Gonna change it soon for another, maybe a Lowepro, that I hade one before"
5,Easy Access,"This bag is probably the best thing I've bought all year. I have been hiking with this bag for the last week and I have had easy easy access to my Canon Rebel TX and the bag is lightweight and safe for the camera. My only complaints are that the zipper needs coaxing to open all the way, my lens cap gets squeezed off as I take it out sometimes, and I wish there was a little bit more room in the extra pocket. I was worried about the strap being uncomfortable, but so far no problems. I am taking it to Europe this fall and I might buy some sort of padding to make sure I am completely comfortable with the bag since I'll be carrying it at all times. Overall, I am very pleased with the bag."
5,Great Emotional Family Story,"When I first picked up 'That Summer At American Beach' I was intrigued and nervous (mostly nervous) because of the ""taboo"" subject matter. But I just could not put it down. This was some of the best storytelling I have come across. I was actually a nervous wreck reading it. Great storytelling I must say. Janice Sims appreciates her gift of writing and it is evident in her wonderful writing she shares with the public. I look forward to her upcoming stories. Just Great Stuff!"
4,A page turner!!,"Mrs. Sims' latest novel is a wonderful read. It's faced paced, packed with believable characters, historical accuracy, and mystery. A definite addition to any romance collection."
4,Debe- Reader,first..................Thank you for a wonderful storyRAYNE Walker was a funny and very passionate woman who wasvery believeable.Wade was a dream come true..........you gave the readera real roller coster ride. ............I am still laughingabout the pink room.......you also gave a history lessonthat many people did not know..........you give the readerwhat she wants.................Thank you
2,"Corporate image shone through, but informative","The author was fairly comprehensive in this book, covering everything that beginning and intermediate-level ice anglers NEED to know for safety, comfort and fishing success. However, after reading half the book I had to put it down due to the overwhelming support the author gives to his obvious sponsor, HT Enterprises. HT does make good equipment, but this book is blatently biased toward their products and the reader is literally pummelled with free advertising for their products. I almost liken this to some TV fishing shows that are obviously paid advertisements cloaked in the veil of good ol' boy entertainment. Consequently, after forcing myself to read the rest of this book, this angler had a bad taste left in his mouth and is wishing he had purchased a different title."
3,"Intriguing idea, so-so actualization","It is likely that yoga can help alleviate depression, and clearly Amy Weintraub has given a good deal of thought and effort into figuring out how yoga can do that. I think the main drawback to the result of her efforts is that the program is an hour and 20 minutes and is not really a good yoga workout per se. I don't feel I can invest that amount of time in a yoga program that does not really provide the benefits of a yoga along with helping with depressive feelings."
3,Not for bipolar,"I was somewhat disappointed with this DVD. When I received it, I discovered that many of the exercises are not for people with bipolar disorder (or inflammatory conditions such as IBD)...which would have been good to know before I bought the DVD. Also, I found the Sanskrit music rather annoying. However, the yoga teacher does seem to know about yoga and depression."
4,Fits my 2002 GMC Yukon,"I bought this for my 2002 GMC Yukon and it fits it perfectly. I have purchased this filter before and it works great. I change it about once every 18 months (every 18K miles). I live in Seattle area, so the filter doesn't get as dirty very much, that's why I can go such long time. In AZ I was changing it every 12 months."
3,Missing Some R&B Hits,"Well, first off, I will say this was a great idea for another Bad Boy compilation. Most of the joints on here are on point...with the exception of New Edition ""Start Turnin' Me On"" (released on their Bad Boy debut, 'One Love' this year)...while the song is decent, it's not a charted R&B; hit...as of yet. Puff Daddy and R. Kelly's ""Satisfy You"" I think could've been left off as well. And no offense to Cheri Dennis, but she has yet to release her Bad Boy debut album so it probably would've been best to do without on this one.Otherwise, this collection is alright. What's sorely missing here is Bad Boy's first female R&B; group Total. They churned out some nice R&B; fare back in the mid to late 90s (i.e. ""Kissin' You"", ""No One Else"", ""Trippin'"", ""What About Us""). Also, I believe there could've been more Faith Evans (""Soon As I Get Home"", ""Love Like This"", ""You Gets No Love"", ""I Love You""). The DVD with music videos makes up for this mishap I guess."
5,Great product.,"This product is great. I spent a couple hours trying to ""pick"" off the old pin stripes from my '03 F150. It only took about 5 minutes with this tool. Well worth the money."
4,Good Product,"I purchased the stripe wheel to remove adhesive stripping on my Jeep Liberty's roof left over from the old slider rails. The wheel worked well, but all I had was a cordless drill, and that seemed to lack the torque required to make the wheel truly effective. That being said it removed the adhesive as stated,"
3,Great on new pin stripe,"I have a 9 year old car that had vinyl pin stripe with areas that looked new in some areas and cracked and faded by the sun in other areas. The 3M Stripe Off Wheel worked better then I expected on the pin stripe that was newer looking but had no effect on the sun damaged pin stripe. I ""erased"" to the point of almost going through the clear coat but it would not come off. Morale of the Purchase: If you have pin stripe that looks newer and can pick it off with a finger nail this is the product for you...if it is cooked on, faded and discolored find another alternative."
3,Almost there,The stripe off wheel does a decent job with newer decals but does not do nearly enough for old pinstripes. The wheel gets hard on the edge as it ages on the shelf. One has to dress the edge anyway so this is not a huge problem. I had trouble with tears along the edge even though I worked hard to keep it flat to the surface. One needs a variable speed drill to use this. Without a variable speed drill the RPMs would be too high and one could burn through the underlying automotive paint.
4,3.5 stars really,"This piece is nice. But, requires the help of chemical solvants to get really hard and aged vinyl decals off your car. Can't get the job done with just this stripe off wheel. But, at the same time, its easy on the hands and lets you use power tools."
1,expired! and didn't work,"The one I received was expired and didn't work. Turned out because it was such a hot day, I was able to just peel the pinstripe off myself!"
5,12 dogs of christmas,Great read for any kid...especially a dog lover! My 7 year old son loved it an loved the CD music that came with it. Highly recommended!
5,12 dogs of xmas,"If you love the 12 Days of Christmas and LOVE dogs, then this book is perfect for you. It should include a CD so you can sing-along. I bought a copy for myself years ago and I like to buy this book for others to enjoy."
5,the twelve dogs of christmas with CD,the book and CD were in very good condition. They have both been enjoyed many times already.
2,Missing Pages!,"The board book version of this is highly flawed. There are missing verses, pictures, and what could be pages from the story. It's obvious b/c it follows the song ""The twelve days of Christmas."" Do not, whatever you do, order this book. We're returning ours ASAP."
4,Great book....but..!,"Actually i didn't have any idea about html before i buy this book.After i read it WOW don't tell me.. it is simplly fantastic .The auther ""Dave Taylor"" has really a solid backgorund.why '4' stars?!..cause it didn't cover cgi&java script properlly..any how thanx Dave for your gift..:)"
4,"Well done, easy to read, good level of detail.","Got a really cool site up and running in three days. As an HTML returnie and a professional programmer I wanted a book with lots of code examples, pictures and very few words. This book goes down smooth in just a few days, gets right to the point and is oriented toward accomplishing something immediately. Not a comprehensive HTML reference rather one of the rare breed of technical books that doesn't make you want to blow your brains out with overkill. Excellent use of summary tables at the end of each chapter."
5,A Rookie's Review,"When Dave Taylor's book arrived I was skeptical about being able to create my own web site using only Simpletext or vi. That was a week ago. Since then I have rebuilt my web site from the ground up and although the new site is not the work of a master, it looks pretty good for a rookie effort. Taylor's book took a complete novice, step by step, through the process of building a fairly complicated web site in under a week--a remarkable feat.This book is a must-have item for anyone interested in learning HTML 4. It is informative enough for an experienced website designer while remaining accessible to the novice. It answered all my questions and provided creative and thoughtful suggestions for building my own site. Clear, concise and comprehensive--go buy this book if you want to learn to create great web pages using HTML 4."
5,Excellent HTML Resource,I've been doing HTML work on and off for the last 5-6 years. This book is full of great examples for beginners or more advanced users who just forgot how to do something. You won't regret owning this book.
1,Not as good as i thought,"When i read about this game from the reviews listed i thought: wow! That sounds like so much fun. The truth is, it's boring and very confusing. Unlike most games creatures does not come w/ intructions in the cover case. It does come w/ instruction manuals in the game, but they are not very good and hard to understand. The norns are very cute, but when you tell them what they do they don't listen. Also, when the bad guys(the grendels)come you don't know what to do and i never, after playing for ten hours figured it out. In all, i think that this game is a waste of money and time. I gave it one star however because the graphics are quite cute."
5,LOved it!,"I got Creatures for Christmas two years ago, and immediately fell in love with it! The norns, were the first thing I loved! They were adorable, helpless things that need your love and attention to help them grow up, and breed! I have breed some amazingly cute norns, and downloaded a lot from the internet! There are always new worlds put into production by Creatures fans like myself! I have gotten some of my freinds to try it, and they loved it too! I strongly recommend this ""game"", a true learning experience!"
2,"Natures plus-natural chlorophyll, 600mg, 90capsules","Not that helpful at all. this product has alfalfa leaves inside the capsules, so it must take alot of time for those to diffuse in your system. i even tried putting it in water and drinking the water after 20mins. i bought it for internal body odor problems that doctors couldn't figure out; they said i was perfectly healthy. i felt like you have to take about 3 or 4 a day to see any effects."
5,Meditations,Celestial Meditations is ideal background for a massage or just those quiet downtimes when you want to turn inward and re-group...way cheaper than a therapist and way more effective....
1,Suckers Will Buy Anything,"I was a huge fan of von Oech's ""A Whack in the Side of the Head."" That is why I was bitterly disappointed by ""A Kick in the Seat of the Pants."" It is ironic that a book about creativity is almost a carbon copy of its predecessor. ""A Kick.."" has at least 50 percent of the text and cartoons from ""A Whack."" I feel robbed, as this book is little more than a revised edition of ""A Whack.""If you already read ""A Whack"" and feel like you are experiencing deja vu while reading ""A Kick"", you are not alone. This book is a rip-off. How would you like to pay to see ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" only to find that half of the movie is footage from ""Star Wars?'"" Shame on von Oech and the publisher for tricking me, and shame on me for being duped. Anyone who enjoyed this book either failed to read ""A Whack on the Side of the Head"" or has extremely short term memory."
2,This book sucks,I had to read it for a class and was not impressed at all. The concepts are hokey and it just seems SO OLD
5,Great Help for Working in Teams,This book is full of ideas to help draw out team members and use their best talents. It has lots of easy-to-apply ideas for keeping creative momentum.
5,Inspirational!,"I sure did get a whack on the side of my head. Claiming not to be a writer, I just received an acceptance for my first manuscript. The idea for my book was inspired after reading A Whack on the Side of the Head. I carry it with me as if it were my bible."
3,If your a Scully or Mulder follower.........,Not recommended it doesn't have that many shots of them and my opininion this calender is not as good as past X-File calenders.But die-hard X-philers that are accepting the next generation X should buy it!
2,What happened?,"I'm quite disappointed in this year's calendar after seeing my friend's calendar from last year. I was expecting something of similar quality. However, aside from my shipper's annoyance at the low percentage of ""important"" moments represented by the images inside, I was also surprised by how the whole thing just looks like not as much effort went into it. The space on each page was not used nearly as well. The one redeeming thing was the month with a picture of Scully - I don't know if I've ever seen her looking as beautiful as she does in that shot. This is why the calendar gets 2 stars instead of one. David, why did you have to leave?????"
1,What a disappointment!,"I always bought the X-Files calendars, being a big fan, but I certainly won't be buying one this year. The reason is because of the lack of pictures of David Duchovny as Mulder and far too many of Robert Patrick, who simply is not calendar material or leading man material, though I'm sure he does his best.I'll opt for the David Duchovny calendar instead (hope you're selling one for 2002), and make my own X-Files calendar using GOOD pictures of Mulder and Scully together."
4,Give the new cast a chance,I loved the pictures of Doggart and Sculley. People have to realize that The original X-Files is over as we know it. Mulder is no more and in 2002 it will be Agent Doggart. I like his character and he is a very strong presence on the show. This is a great calender and I will purchase them as long as they are available!
5,X-FILES RULES,"I have been a fan since the pilot ep., and we all know the show will be deeply missed....as usual, the calender kicks.... definitely one of the better products fox puts out....PHILERS UNITE!..."
3,Printing Errors,"Now, maybe it's just me, but my calendar has no ""box"" for the final week of each month. There is an extra row of ""boxes"" at the top of each month, where the day of the week is listed.Other than making the calendar pretty awkward to actually -use- it is a great visual piece."
4,Better than what I expected,I read some reviews here by people who trashed this calendar and I think its as handsome and interesting as any other of the previous X Files calendars and purchased one for next year. People need to realize that Doggett had far more screen time than Mulder and that is because Duchovny decided to not be as big a part of the show anymore. It makes sense to have more pics of Doggett for this season's calendar.
5,X Files is the BOMB!!!!!!!!!,"I love the cover, it just says it all. Thats just so great because Mulder's and Scully's faces are in the front because its all abouy M&S. And they put Doggett in the back as the 3rd wheel because he really is, there is no way he can know Scully the way Mulder knows her. But hes alright and I Just know inside is gona look great filled with pictures and dialouges of the episodes. X-files Rocks my world. From the #1 fan, really very devoted fan, a kind of Fan that never misses the shows every Saturday and Sundays, Yours trully,Jessenia Nova"
5,Duuuuurden,"This is the hottest record I have ever purchased from amazon. Durden's got them hooks - his style cooks! Buy this album, you will love it."
4,Fish Finder,"First off, it works. So the only things you need to figure out is if there is a better/cheaper product. I guess some people might have some reservations about ""cheating"" with this device, but even you guys can buy it and use it only on those incredibly slow days when the fish just don't seem to be biting."
1,Installation Issue,"It is not stated in the description of the Garmin 90 but you have to drill a 1-1/8"" hole in the top of the console in order to pass the transducer cable through to the unit. The large size of the connector also made it impossible for me to pull it through the under floor access tube from the transom to the center console. Take a look at the Humminbird PiranhaMax 160 as it only requires a 5/8"" hole."
3,Not a new unit,"The unit arrived in the appropriate time. However, I discovered that the unit was a return (the original purchaser's note was still in the box with the unwrapped finder). It was obvious that the unit had been returned and had been used."
4,Replacement for Garmin Fishfinder 85,Had to replace a Garmin Fishfinder 85 that failed after one year and only 3 months of service on the water. The Garmin 90 plugged into the boat's existing Fishfinder 85 sensors and worked immediately. Does an adequate job. I don't see a lot of differences from the Garmin 85.
1,!@#$%^&*(),Never purchased a fish finder - I did buy a GPS which I really love Never purchased a fish finder - I did buy a GPS which I really love
4,Classic Punk Unearthed,"This reissue was worth it and I've heard that Metal Urbain even influenced Big Black. However, except for the use of synths, I would put them closer to classic punk than the wide variety of sonic experiments that encompass post punk. The synths are played as direct punk instruments not as soundscapes for morbid, meandering lyrics. A manic, wired, Francophile version of the Sex Pistols with the synths for a change of pace. Not exactly Suicide as the songs are quite similar in length and tone but then again this was the early days of punk. However, as classic punk goes, this is up there with the best of them. Now if only I could understand the lyrics."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"I ordered this car seat after much time spent researching different car seats, this had the greatest reviews, and I can easily see why. The car seat is easy to install, my 5 month old fits perfectly in this, and has much to grow into it. It doesn't take up a lot of room in back seat, and, I love that you can take the cover of to wash it. Not to mention we're a family of hunters, and the camo is a must for our little one!! I would recommend this product to anyone's child that has outgrown thier infant carrier!!"
1,DO NOT BUY - - - This seat is not safe!,"This seat looks nice and my 20 month old son is comfortable in it. However, last week as we were driving he reached down between his legs, lifted up the lever and lossened the shoulder straps. He is not a genius - any 20 month old child can do the same. I can't believe that BRITAX has not recalled this car seat."
1,"misleading pic, and come with missing critical parts","Take a close look at the pic of this product: You can see there is a black strap hanging below the seat cover on the side. But when the product was delivered to me, there was no strap to be found on the side, which (according to its own user's manual) is a critical part for installing the seat in the rear-facing position onto my car seat.What a false advertisement."
5,Awesome Carseat,I bought this for my son. He loves it! It has survived spills and crumbs. Each time we were able to get the spills out. It is a great carseat.
5,baby car seat,"Very nice car seat. Bought it as a gift for my next grandchild, but it will also carry through toddler."
4,Britax Marathon in a 2006 Honda Accord,"No complaints. The seat is seemingly safe, according to all the reports, and is seemingly comfy. My daughter seems to enjoy riding in the seat, which is a good sign.Installation is fairly simple, though it does take some muscle if you're going the seatbelt route (vs LATCH.) I figure this is the same scenario with any carseat.This is not a small seat by any means. I am petite (5'1"", 110 pounds) and have to sit a bit sideways when sitting next to the now front-facing, center-mounted seat.As far as cleanliness is concerned, the seat has endured multiple milk spills, ground in food - you name it - and hasn't had problems coming clean and remaining ""cushy"" to the touch."
5,Love my new carseat!!!,"After researching car seats online for some time, I caved in and spent the money on the Britax Marathon. It is worth every penny!! My daughter is 26 pounds and has so much room to grow. She falls asleep every time she is in th car now. It was so easy to install, took no time. I would buy this seat again without hesitation."
5,Awesome car seat!,"This is by far the best car seat we have owned. It is very secure, and our son rides comfortably in it. It reclines enough so that when he falls asleep, his head and neck have support and don't fall forward. He sits up high and enjoys being able to see where we are going now that he is forward facing. I wish we had been smart enough to buy this car seat first instead of buying the ""cutsie"" rear-facing one only. Well worth the extra dollars spent. Our son's safety has no price tag."
3,"Good Seat, Bad Traveler","This is a great car seat for my daughter, but it is a nightmare to carry between cars, or worse through an airport. It is very heavy, large, and lacks any logical handle. The seat appears comfortable even on long drives, but I wish it would recline further for trips when I know (hope) my child will be sleeping most of the ride."
4,Wonderful Game,"This is a great game which lets you experience the nerves, frustration, and satifaction of playing a brutal links course (Royal Troon, the only one they give you) against stiff competion. The Announcers are fun and exciting, and you can be one of PGA Stars (Jesper Parnevik, David Duval, Vijah Singh, Jeff Sluman are among the best.) You can play a variety of weather and course conditions. The only mistake is that you can only play one course Royal Troon(Home of the 1997 Open). Trying to hit the 17th green not only gets old but somewhat impossible in touramentconditions."
4,best source of pol pot information,"...such as it is. The few known details of Pol POt's life can be found in this slim biography. Chandler's _The Tragedy of Cambodian History_ has better information on the Democratic Kampuchea movement in general, but if you're looking for the nitty gritty on this one person, this (to my knowledge) the only place to find it.Unfortunately, _Brother Number One_ was written before the capture of Pol Pot and Nate Thayer's subsequent interview. Hence the modern period is neglected and a conscientious reader will have to seek out that information on his own."
2,Pol Pot - still hard to grasp,"If you are looking for a history of the Khmer Rouge regime, I'd rather recommend one of Ben Kiernan's books. If you are looking for a well-documented biography of Pol Pot, you are not going to like this book.True, the author has gathered as much information on Pol Pot as possible, but that amount of information could be summarised on just a few pages. To make it into a book, you get a history of Cambodia - and there are better ones around than this one -, and lots of speculation about Pol Pot's psychology, which I found annoying."
4,"Good book, obscure subject matter.","It's a beautiful book, with wonderful, beautiful color lithographs & blank-&-white drawings. The book is filled with one-page vignettes from Pennsylvania Dutch life. The prose is a bit dated (""Conquering the Forest,"" etc.), but it's good primer on where the Pennsylvania Dutch come from. And there aren't exactly loads of picture books on the Pennsylvania Dutch. It's a fun book for sharing your heritage if you can add to it with some stories of your own."
1,handbook of denominations from liberal viewpoint,"This book is innacurate and not worth buying. Other much better written handbook of denominations are available, and this one shows both a misunderstanding of the Christian faith, and a bias towards the islamic faith. Leaves me with two questions: (1) Who really wrote this trash? (2) Who paid this publisher to let it get out?"
4,Interesting Find,"Fogerty shows diverstiy in this forgotten little gem. Covers of Hank Williams Sr.,the 5 Blind Boys of Alabama,and Jimmy Rogers,and other classic country and gospel tunes are here. Though I prefer the Country tunes to the Gospel covers,(John's voice is better geared toward Rock and Country)this collection of material is definately worth checking out."
4,John Fogerty,If you are a John Fogerty fan you will like this album. It is a typical example of the 70's John Fogerty.
3,Bluegrass Fogerty ? !!,"This CD became available again when Fogerty rose to the top of the charts in the 1980's with ""Centrefield"" (Even knocked Bruce's ""Born In The USA"" off the number 1 spot!!)My first impression was not good as I was expecting some great riff like the one from ""Old Man Down The Road"" to open up the CD. Instead I was greeted by a bluegrass banjo! Yikes!!But it grows on you and it is great to hear ""Rock"" style versions of these classic country/bluegrass/gospel tunes. The upbeat numbers are great, the gospel tunes are good but the ballads are pure pain to listen to!! But CCR was always a ""singles"" band not a cocept album band so it is par for the course.This will not appeal for the ""Greatest Hits"" fans but the hard core Fogerty fans will find it interesting. Now that Fogerty is into dobro etc it would be great for him to try another effort like this without the agonizingly dull ballads...keep it rocking!"
3,Not Impressed With This,"This album was a nice attempt at going solo. But I'm not sure if John Fogerty wanted to go solo with this or form another band. It has a combination of country, bluegrass, and rock. I get the impression that John wasn't sure what type of music he wanted for this one. Some of the songs on this were fantastic and had that Creedence flavor to it. Other songs like, Have Thine Own Way Lord were not even alright. I bought this because it was a John Fogerty album and I'm a big fan of John's whether in Creedence or as a solo artist. If you're as big a fan of John's as I am, then buy this to have a complete collection. If not, then don't bother."
2,I love country song.,I very love country country.Since I can remember I had listened country.Until now I still like that song.
4,fogerty country,"Released in 1973, after the breakup of Creedence (sob), Fogerty's first solo album was a fun look back at country roots. In fact, since I only own a cassette version, checking this out reminded me to buy a cd. (OK, still luddite for not going MP3 or something even more hip. Check out my name."
3,"Kind of cheesy, for fans only","This is a one-shot comic (originally) that is based on a VHS movie/short called Three Chains of Gold. It sets Prince up as the ""superhero"" and his bandmates are his helpers. It's all about a woman who comes to him for help. It's cheesy, silly, just plain odd in fact, but what do you expect from Prince?! Definitely a fan ""keeper."" But make no mistake, it's ONLY for fans. Other folks should just skip it. It's 3 stars because i'm a prince fan. For non-fans this is a 2."
4,A very handy little book,"It you want to learn VBScript go elsewhere. However, if you just want a quick reference that you can take anywhere this is the only book for you. It is remarkably concise and very well written. Its perfect for the VBScritp programmer that needs a little help from time to time looking up a hard to remember command and its syntax."
3,Could be better,"The reference material seems accurate but I have found more detail in the free help file that comes with VBS 5.6. Return values and types and the actual values of the builtin constants, which I didn't find in the book.I apparently overlooked the note that this book was based on VBS 5.5 when I ordered it. I have several pocket references and this is the first that fell short of my needs."
5,Just What I Was Looking For!,I was given two of these clips from a friend some time ago to try out. The clips were wonderful and I still use them. Amazon has the best price on these and are used for everything. They will last me for years!
5,Best Clips Ever Designed,"I can't say enough good about these clips. They are, bar none, the best clips I've ever used. They also give many years of reliable service."
5,The best chip clips.,"These are the best chip clips. They keep everything fresh! I use them for chips, crackers, and even staples like brown sugar."
5,Love them!,Very sturdy and they come in assorted sizes. Color coding helps when grabbing one quickly from the drawer. HIghly recommended.
5,"Found these by accident years ago, a must have for every home.","Occasionally, I have to re-purchase to replace the worn and lost ones, for my son's family, too. I use these for open bread, chips, crackers, etc pretty much anything that needs to be re-sealed."
4,Can't live w/o them!,"They are what they are...and a great version at that! Really a 4.5 and would of been 5 stars if they had @ least (2) 8""-10"" clips, but the value is excellent. Time will tell for durability. AND it came a day early...."
5,Awesome clips,"I agree with everyone else: these are awesome. I bought one bag for myself, then had to reorder another bag because they were used in so many places, and then I bought several more as stocking stuffers for friends.My only caution is that the smaller sizes (lime green in particular) are smaller and therefore thinner plastic, so the home wreckers that are toddlers can bend the lock part of the clip too far back and render them somewhat broken. Just keep the green ones out of tiny hands and you should be fine!"
2,A gimmick SACD,A hybrid stereo SACD. I bought these SACD thinking to experience to listen CCR in multichannel sound. Forget it!!! It's a stereo recording in a SACD. A true gimmick!!!
1,Gaackk!,"It's entertaining enough, I suppose. But--where are the detailed, verifiable predictions that investigators could use to validate (or negate) it?"
4,John Alex Nunnery Steals the show,I saw this film at the Victoria Texas Film Festival. It is a sad drama set against the lust backdrop of a hot Mississippi summer. Brothers dealing with Absentee parents. The crowds at the festival fell in love with young John Alex Nunnery who plays the younger brother Fess in the film. His youthfulness graced the film. The older brother who played Robbie was also at the festival but both him and his mother acted like fools leaving a bad taste for many for the film. Once the crowd got over this it was easy to appreciate the cinemaphotograpy. It was a good film. I will be watching for John Alex Nunnery and Patrick Rutherford to be stars one day. I will see Will Ruffin cleaning tables at Denny's.
5,nice pins,"Well, there isn't a whole lot I can say, they are what they are. BUT, I did want to add this review since unfortunately I have used cheaper ones in the past and had terrible results. The cheap pins actually ruined one of my guns by mangling the firing pin. after that I picked up the Cadex pin nailer and started using these pins. The combo has worked great so far."
3,Hesitant Husband - Jackie Merritt,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERWILLFUL WOMANKim Armstrong had found the husband of her drams. Mitch Conover was rugged and sexy -- but too darn stubborn and proud to admit his obvious attraction. But Kim had a plan to get Mitch into her bed -- and her life -- permanently.HARD-HEARTED MANMitch Conover was determined to succeed at Armstrong Construction by nothing less than hard work and plenty of it. Then he met Kim Armstrong -- the most enticing female he'd ever laid eyes on -- who turned out to be the boss's daughter! Mitch swore she was the last female he'd ever fall for. But was his ironclad willpower any match for one willful, beautiful, marriage-minded woman?"
2,"""Written by an expert on the Trompowsky"" Don't make me laugh...","Been playing the Trompowsky now and then and already have two books on this opening (""Winning with the Trompowsky"" from GM Peter Wells, 2003 and ""The Trompowsky"" from GM Joe Gallagher, 1998). I only found 4 games in the Chessbase MegaBase 2007 where GM Nigel Davies actually played the Trompowsky (A45) - two wins in 1998 and two draws in 2000 (the wins were against much lower rated players than him).Atleast GM Gallagher played 14 games with the Tromp (68% wins) and GM Wells 31 (66% wins of which one against GM Shirov in 2006, blowing the latter off the board in 13 moves!).I'll just keep the books I already have and look up games by GM Adams (47 games with the Tromp, 62% wins), GM Wells, GM Gallagher and, maybe best of all, GM Igor Miladinovic (118 Tromps and 75% wins!)."
1,Ricci Italian flatware,"I was so very disappointed when I received the flatware. When I did the search, I requested Italian-made flatware and Ricci popped up. Of course, silly me, I thought it was made in Italy. It was made in Vietnam. It was huge and heavy. I returned it and found a flatware made in the good ole USA. Again, it is huge and heavy but will use the salad forks instead of the dinner forks because it's just everyday stuff. I'll continue to look for another set -- it will probably have to be very old or Languoile (if it's made in France and when I can afford it).Amazon is usually very good when I'm looking for something but this was a letdown for me."
2,Ugh!,"I am very unhappy with this stroller. The cupholder broke and fell off after two weeks. Then within two months, the cosmetic parts that cover the unsightly screws fell off on both sides(it basically looks like a car without hubcaps). At times it will take me several tries to open it. Beyond that, it is almost impossible to stear on some surfaces, like polished concrete. On other surfaces it's just hard. The front wheels seem to have a mind of their own. I am constantly runnning into people and things because the front wheels almost refuse to just go straight. On the upside, it reclines nicely and the canope is great."
2,"Aria OH, what a rip-off","Where do I start. For our third child, we decided to get Peg Perego. Stroller is light-weight, and can be pushed one handed,and is easy to handle.No other redeeming qualities. Cup-holder is a joke, and broke off the first day. Snack tray pops out repeatedly. Harness is ridiculous, very cumbersome to put on, requires about 10 steps to put on. High pinch factor. Harness requires the child be absolutely still, which is not possible. Back-rest requires three hands to operate. With the back-rest down and with the infant car seat,cannot access the storage basket.Got taken in by the Peg Perego name, never again."
4,peg perego ok,"It's great for travel, very light weight. As far as the cup holder, who the heck uses a cup holder on a stroller? We didn't attach the cup holder so no problem.We have had good luck opening the stroller which was another problem people mentioned.I like the stroller."
5,I LOVE this stroller!,"I was desperate for a stroller that would keep my very active toddler(26 months) secure, as he was able to unbuckle the harnesses on my 3 previous strollers. This stroller has a great harness; very easy to put on (just put the arms in and buckle)and the child has complete freedom of movement yet cannot squirm out or unbuckle it. Ingenious design! My child enjoys sitting forward and now has more patience while I shop. It is lightweight and very easy to fold. Also has a side handle for carrying. Easy to push, small enough for little aisles and the basket is a decent size, too. Can't figure out how to attach their cupholder; I bought another type to use. I am going to LOVE this in Disney as I now feel my son is very secure. This is a quality product."
2,Lightweight but overpriced,"Bought this stroller a year ago and so far its done alright. We really like how light it is and the ease of folding. But for the price we paid, its not worth it. The sticker in front started falling off almost immediately, as did the covers on the sides near the handle. The cup holder is pretty much useless and the basket underneath is small, and to put anything larger than a book in it you need to have the seat positioned fully upright which is hard to do when you're hauling around a baby sleeping in the carseat. Its easy to push around but has a tendancy to get stuck when you go over anything but pavement. The 'car seat adapter' that comes with is just a strap you loop over the car seat. Our seat ended up fitting nicely inside but others might not. Overally, we've found this stroller to be generously overpriced."
1,Swan song indeed,As a fan of Nana I bought this CD and also the DVD version without hesitation but to regret it. I can hardly understand what she is singing. Indeed this is the one that will certainly ruin the reputation of the everlasting Nana.
1,Atrociously off pitch,"Nana Mouskouri was a GREAT singer in the 60's and 70's, perhaps one of the greatest non-operatic singers of the 20th century, but by the mid 80's her voice was not in good shape and she should have retired. Every song here is off pitch, her voice wobbles, runs out of breathe, sounds very amateurish, if you love Nana avoid this album for it would tarnish her memory."
1,croakster,"Buy this album to hear how jazz should NOT sound. Our expectations are often unfairly high for jazz singers, because we don't realize how badly executed the craft of singing jazz can be. ""Nana Swings"" about as much as a cactus."
4,SWINGS & SINGS,I GOT THIS CD AFTER SEEING THE CONCERT ON DVD FROM THE LIBRARY.THE MUSIC IS GREAT AND NANA SURE CAN SING.
1,What a waste,"I know Nana liked to try different things, but in this CD the beautiful arrangement were wasted on her thin voice. Nana can't swing."
2,First Experience with thigh highs was a turn off,"I bought these stockings after having read all of the reviews. I knew what to expect/knew they were cheap etc. This is my only experience with thigh high stockings. I'm not sure if this is always true or just these stockings but they did not really stay up. There was an uncomfortable plastic band at the top, i guess to keep them up but the stockings kept rolling down. I bought them only for use in the bedroom, and although my boyfriend liked them, I did not. I guess I should have gotten plus size? I'm 5'9 but I only weigh 170 so I figured that was ""normal"". Good news is the stockings didn't tear like some people said they might so I can use them again if I want to..."
1,Did Not Stay Up,"Very pretty and comfortable, but did not stay up at all. I ended the evening barelegged."
1,Too much activity?,"I bought these stockings for valentines day for my boyfriend and I. I only bought them to look sexy in and not to wear on a regular basis. I wore them three times and both stockings tore in the same spot. It's not like I was doing anything really ""vigorous"" in them. They were so cute and I liked the look of them and they fit great. I was really upset when I had to toss them after I only used them a few times. If your going to be doing anything other than walking, these may not be the ones for you."
2,the top part has no underwire,The top part has no underwire in the bra part which has very little support for someone with larger breasts...
2,Ok.,OK FOR THE PRICE. A BIT THIN AND FLIMSY. Stay Up Thigh High ADULT (Color: White Size:90-160 lbs) Leg Avenue
3,Stockings,I bought this for boudoir pictures but I didn't like how it fit me on my thigh. It is a great product.
4,"Good, but wish the nylons were stronger","they stay up perfectly but snag easy, thats with any pantyhose or thigh highs though. over-all i like them and would get them again."
1,only for the tall,"These thigh highs (one size fits most) are really not meant for petite sized females. I am 5' tall. Once out of the package it was obvious that they are quite long. tube shaped rather than foot shaped at the bottom. They puddled at the ankles and the knees. The top lace has a sticky type coating that I found uncomfortable (but that might have been because they were up higher than my thighs - due to the length. They do stay up, but for those of us who are shorter than the norm, they are a poor fit. The Hanes version is much better. They stay up and you can choose the proper length."
3,Works,"These stockings do stay up on own. I wear with garter just for my on peace of mind. They are scratchy & do snag & run easily, so beware. Also, if you don't have model thin legs, you will have rolls & bulges over the top of the lace."
4,poor quality,"I have bought the la1022 for my girl friend as now it seems they are really a poor quality,the toes are no longer covered with that dark silky strip and the material is really cheap and does not even feel smooth or silky.They actally feel rough to be honest.they either changed vendors or cut cost to make them cheaper and boy did they.WE will be looking for something else from now on,what a shame as was a great product as they were silky,and darker then the other brands and would stretch better as well.Don't buy the la1022's anymore you will be disappointed unless you get old stock."
4,sheer stocking,I prefer with no line showing on the toe area.But if u dont mind that they are pretty and sexy on. The price is reasonable. Delivery was good.Will be ordering more
3,"Suitable for use with SpicySpot Lace Garter Belt With Matching Thong, Black","Quality is just so-so. The price was about commensurate with the quality, affordable but not exceptional. And I doubt they'll last too many reuses or washings."
2,Disappointed,"When I ordered it said they were black and I received white. I kept them any way. The thigh high was perfect in size. I am over 6feet. However, where the nylon meets the band there were small holes in them. I will only get 2 wears out of them."
1,Thigh high hose,These were definitely not plus size and there was nothing to hold them up. You get what you pay for here!
2,Dis satisfied,My wife did not care for the elastic at the top. It did not hold after a short walk and kept sliding down.
1,"As others mentioned, only for the tall","As other reviews mentioned, these are only for women who are tall (I am 5'2 and they bunch up, slipping down). The quality of the nylons is high, if they only fit they would have a customer for life."
1,I was truly unhappy with these stockings,"I couldn't wear these at all. They ran while I was putting them on the first time. I didn't notice, and left the house with them on, but I didn't even get half a block before I took them off. They didn't stay up for even a few minutes while I was walking. I don't usually do bad reviews, but I paid for something I couldn't use at all."
1,do not stay up,do not stay up. a lightly sticky substance at inner top. doesn't even adhere to itself much less to me
4,Good quality product!,"I bought these to go under a pencil skirt i was wearing to attend a wedding. I picked them because of wider band of lace at the top. I didnt wear a garter belt with them because it states they stay up, which they did until i was up on my feet dancing..etc. By the end of the night they were falling down, but if worn with a garter belt they should be fine. Very good quality stockings, i didnt experience any runs or tears. I would defiantly purchase from this company again!"
4,Works.,"It works and the performance is decent. I ordered 3 and they are actually daisy chained. WRT54G->200ft(cat6)->switch->50ft->switch->100ft->switch. No impact on internet performance at all. Did not test with LAN data transfers though. These have been reliably working for over a week. If you just need 100mbit performance, buy these."
5,A masterpiece,"YEA this album is a must(for each melodic metal fan).Moonsorrow play a mix of blackmetal with incredibles viking melodies, all in a epical contextthis guys show something new, its not a predictable bandits original, well gifted of technique.suchhhhh a banddd guysss"
2,Great musicianship marred by roaring vocals,"Nothing like having tight, excellent musicianship, pleasing melodies, and provocative musical development ruined by screeching, roaring vocals. If you like death metal you'll like this album, but for those who prefer their metal sung clean there's not a track that isn't personified by the persistent roar of Uruk-hai growling in place of the kind of vocal choruses that would really give the band's music its epic magnificence. I recognize that this is a matter of taste and, much as I've tried, I just can't get past growling, roaring, rasping vocalisms, and I wish I would have read a review like this to let me know what I would be getting into when I bought this album. Much as I love the guitar interplay and musical development, my enjoyment of this band is given a hefty axe by their grunting vocal style. No thanks."
4,A good Lon Chaney picture from the early 20's.,"I've seen at least a dozen Lon Chaney films, some better than others, but ""Flesh and Blood"" stands out for me as one of the better ones. Lon Chaney himself, in comparison with a few of his later roles, is remarkably restrained as David Webster, a man wrongfully accused for a crime he did not commit, who escapes from prison to reunite with his family. He doesn't overplay his part, but manages to convey perfectly the emotions of a man tortured by the fact that he can never reveal his true identity to his daughter, played by Edith Roberts, without endangering her happiness. It's great to see him playing a father rather than his usual unrequited lover role, and in that respect, this movie gives him a bit more room to stretch out in.The movie does lag a bit in spots, but overall it's a very well done silent film and one well worth watching, especially if you're a Chaney fan."
4,"Wild Adventure, indeed!","The Robinson family is busy traversing the reaches of deep space, as the meddling Dr. Zachary Smith repeatedly complicates their lives. First, he releases the Jupiter 2's reserve fuel supply into space, and after the ship is eventually refueled, he sets it on a collision course with Earth's sun. Later, as the Robinsons decide to return to a now nearby Earth, Smith falls under the influence of an alien siren, Athena, and the Robinsons must rescue him from an hypnotic space walk, employing a change of direction which makes their return to Earth impossible. This is the only episode from the second season of Lost in Space which feature an airborne Jupiter 2 from beginning to end, and it marks the first appearence of Athena (who shows up later in ""The Girl from the Green Dimension"")."
5,Awesome Game! A must play!,"I originally would have given it four stars, but I got the new enhanced Battlepack version and decided to give it five because it now has better graphics. It's got a great plotline and it is easy to maneuver a mech. People who like this should get the awesome MECHWARRIOR 2: TITANIUM STAND ALONE because its not a cheap remake with better graphics as so many people think because of similar box covers but its not. Its a different game because there's more missions and 40 mechs to choose from."
4,Just Can't Get Sick of It,"This album was made in 1996, way after Greg Kihn's heyday, such as it was. I can't name even three Greg Kihn songs that aren't on this record. So why has this CD never been out my of reach since somebody pushed it on me many years ago? Because I can't get enough of his weary voice and the lush but understated orchestral backing on Noa Noa and Horror Show. The title track is as poignant as John Fogerty's Long as I Can See the Light or the Kinks' Hollywood Boulevard. Speaking of which, Kihn's Waterloo Sunset may be the most underrated cover of the most underrated band of all time."
5,I'm happy that this man told his story.,I'm happy that this man had the courage to tell his story from his viewpoint of that awful war.
2,"Fascinating to read, but it strains credulity.","I found this book fascinating to read, but it does strain credulity. Did all this really happen to one man during WWII? And, as a downed flyer and escapee from a German POW camp, how did he instantly learn to communicate with Russians, Poles, Mongols, and the rest? There are too many scenes in which a translator should have been present, but was not. Anything is possible, of course, but I found it unconvincing. If read as a novel, it's much more satisfying."
4,Excellent Service,This book was purchased for my grandson who requested it by name. Without much time to find and ship it I located it here on Amazon for a very low price and had it shipped directly. It arrived at its destination within the week!
4,Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction,"A number of reviews here don't buy the idea that this is a true story. Dan Baker says its a true story. The historical events described are all verifiably true. It rings true to me.This story has the immediacy of a first person narrative, with a surprisingly poignant love story at the end. Recommended."
3,Pales in Comparison,"This effort pales in comparison to the works of Deva Premal, who has a superior voice, at least to my ear."
5,Another Winner from Debrah Morris,"Having fallen in love with Debrah Morris's humorous writing style and wonderful storytelling in When Lightning Strikes Twice, I was eager to get my hands on A Little Night Matchmaking and the book was worth the wait! I loved Brandy's story as much as Joe's, and I was laughing out loud at byplay between the precocious daughter Chloe and the heavenly helper Celestian. Morris doesn't disappoint with this story of star-crossed lovers who get a little help from above. The characters came alive for me from page one and left me eager for her next book. I highly recommend A Little Night Matchmaking!"
1,Do not bother with it!,"This was my first book by this author, and it was awful. There is NO plot; all there is sex, and not even good sex at that! I think part of the problem of the book is that is beyond unrealistic. I understand the need to suspend belief for a book, but this just expects you to suspend it a bit too much."
1,Expected better,"Where do I begin?First of all,I did not like any of the characters.When reading a romance novel(and i'm guessing this is suppose to be one)you're suppose to root for the main couple.In this book,I honestly didn't care what happened.This whole book was mostly sex.How are you suppose to enjoy the sex scenes if you don't care about the couple doing it?I didn't feel any love between them.No actions on either one of their parts to prove that even if the words where not spoken.The characters and plot were both weak,the sex scenes and dialogue was repeated over and over again.If I like a book,I usually re-read it several times.Lets just say I was glad when I finished this."
2,Disappointing Read,"I was looking for a quick and fun read. This is my first book by this author and I was very disappointed. I have read a lot of novels by Lind Howard, Lori Foster, Cherry Adair, and Emma Holly. This novel was not in the same league. The book just seems to run out of speed. While the relationship has a few erotic moments, there was not enough heat to sustain my interest."
2,Disappointing Read,"I am an avid reader of Ms. Devine and eagerly await her books. I was disappointed in her latest. The sex scenes are very murky and not as richly detailed as in her 'Secret Pleasures' novel. In a way, this book almost felt like a rehash of that excellent book; but, definitely inferior."
3,"Neat, extremely short CDs","For a prolific and good composer like Kitaro, it may be difficult to provide a nice compliation that can satisfy everyone. But this one does a pretty good job on selection of tracks. However, the CDs seem to be a bit ""short"" - time-wise, and I am a bit upset about having to pay a 2 CD price and then get a 1.5 CD worth music. Granted, the selections will be to the liking of all Kitaro and most New age fans...a little bit of repitition in tunes and arrangements, but nothing annoying. Good CDs, not classic. Between this and Mozart/Bach, pick the latter."
2,Musically uninteresting...,"Unfortunately, the sound clips provided here on-line do not indicate that Kitaro will be both annoyingly repetitious and pretty much stuck in the upper registers of human hearing, almost completely ignoring what we call ""bass."" I was very much disappointed, having been permanently separated from my money. Perhaps I can trade it at a local pawn shop..."
4,Look into my face!!,This book was real scary to me but i hated when Beth broke the Barbie Dolls. The you for making a scary book.
2,head for the shed,"I love the music of the Bhundu boys , but would not advise purchasing this album, unless you are adding to your existing collection of their music.After the Shed Sessions, this is really a lightweight offering.There are , without doubt, moments of joy, but it somehow lacks the infectious, raw energy I associate with this great band."
2,This isn't really history,Billy Kennedy loves to recount every tale @ the Scotch-Irish he finds under every rural outhouse in the hill-billy South--and he never documents where he actually found it! This is not history-its myth & fable to make Scotch-Irish protestants feel warm and fuzzy.
1,Roller coaster,"I couldn't get it to do much. I got part of a section up, but couldn't turn it so it would make a full circle."
4,A Fun Introspective Bluegrass Folk piece of Americana,"Hard to say. Bluegrass? Folk? It's a big piece of Americana fun, to be sure. Grandpa and the boys serve it up right - loud, loose and funloving. With energizingly happy songs like Plymouth Roadrunner (mentioning some strange passengers) to the fittingly ""This Might be Me or You"" which make the record turn to a place you didn't really expect to go - the Drovers trip the light fantastic."
5,"Great addition to the ""that's not my..."" collection!","These books are great for a range of ages! For the pre-verbal it keeps their interest with the large pictures and of course the touch & feel on each page. For the older kiddos the describing words such as ""fuzzy, silky, squashy, etc."" enriches their vocab so wonderfully. Also because the story is so simple, toddlers can recall what the next page is about before you turn to it! Love this whole series and I highly recommend for any child 0-3yrs old!"
5,Love these books!,"I love the whole series of these books and so does my little one! This book in particular has some textures that are a little more unusual and we love it the best. It has ""wrinkly"" and ""wooly"" and ""shiny"" instead of the standard ""soft"" or ""Fuzzy"". Buy them all, read them all, they are all great!!!"
1,"Filthy, not gently used","I have no problem giving my kids used books, but this should have gone to recycling. The tail on bunny on the front cover of the book is gray, it's that filthy. There are chunks of... I really don't even want to know what stuck to the pages inside. This company didn't even *attempt* to clean it up before sending it to me."
3,"We love this book, but beware the shiny eyes!","Our baby loves this book and it's her favorite board book to look at. However, when she was looking at the page with the shiny eyes by herself while I was doing something else in the room, I found her with black marks all over her fingers and tongue. I figured out the black was from the ""shiny eyes""! She must have licked / drooled on the eyes, then stuck her fingers in it. The eyes are like those cheap watercolor paints, so you get a little pot of black paint there for your baby to stick her fingers in... Other than this major flaw, we love the book and still read it with her, but she's not allowed to feel the shiny eyes anymore."
3,Movie Purchase,I ordered a movie and received it quickly. One problem I had with this purchase was that the case the movie came in was cracked when I received it.
3,Broken Case,"The case was broken in few spots. I had to tape it to keep it together. One of the special features discs had a scratch causing it to skip a little, but the 3 actual movies did work."
3,"saw trilogy-saw 1,2,3","the movie & the bonus was interesting and was good to watch, but when I received the product the packaging for the movie was cut in 2 places. I was disappointed with that, because it was a present and the packaging was a special for a keepsake."
5,The Horror Expert From Past to Present,"As for Horror Movies go so Far the Texas Chain Massager is still the Number one Father of all horro Flicks to this day. Then Saw 1-7 is to this day the leading bloody, and gore since the Original Texas Chain Saw massager there is. I give 5 thumbs up for both Movies. To this Day I have not seen a Horror Movie that has been able to stand the Hair up on the back of My neck in Years."
2,"Great Movies, Bad Packaging","Despite the fact that the movies are perfect for any gore hound, the packaging is just stupid. Don't get me wrong, it looks cool, but it can not withstand the mail, apparently. I received it with numerous cracks in it. The discs were in great condition, but the plastic casing was shot. If you really need t get this, get it from Target or Half-Price Books."
5,for all saw enthusists,"Wife only had Saw 4 So for her birthday got her saw 1-3 and Saw 5 aswell, we werent dissapointed. Game Over!"
3,Nice Movie Bad Price,"whoever watches this movie and is a horror fanatic should be delighted with Saw, Saw II, and Saw III. I just love it when a person has to cut off their leg to escape a trap. And Unlike any other horror movie, this movie has a plot that doesn't just die after the first movie. However I have given this 6-disc collection 3 stars mainly because of the price. Whoever is selling these dvds you need to realize that the price is a little hefty. Say if a person bought all 3 of the 2-disc collections separately on Amazon. Their total would be:Saw: $9.99Saw II: $14.99Saw III:+$39.99=$64.97And you get them new. The $79.99 one is used. The new one is $99.99. you would be spending $35.02 more! I would consider reducing the price down to about at least $55 or $60. But that's the only problem. Great movies though."
3,Un-disclosed Problem,"The folks who made this system failed to advertise that there is a limit to how many songs the MP3 will play. I had a disc with over 200 songs on it, and the system will only repeat the first 100 songs at best. I wish I would have known this before I purchased it. Other than that problem, the sound is excellent. Radio reception is great, and the size works for its portability."
2,No so good quality,"I got this radio for my Mother in law who listens to a lot of mp3 cds. While it worked for a time, after a bit, it simply stopped reading mp3 disks.It is a good price, but not a very good value."
4,Just what I needed,I bought this to play my mp3's out on the porch. The size was perfect. The sound is a little hollow but good for the price and the use I put it to.
3,Not bad for CD/Cassette and MP3 combo,"Its hard to find a boombox which plays MP3 and also has cassette recorder. The unit, however, is not sturdy. We used it for 2 years and then volume control broke and could not be fixed. Now, we have to discard this unit and get a new unit. But then there are not many choices for boombox with both cassette and MP3 players."
3,Does the Job,"It is becoming increasingly difficult to find portable CD players, with speakers, that also play MP3 CDs. This product fit the bill perfectly. The audio quality is good, the sound is clear, and the MP3 CD starts up reasonably fast.The major gripe is that they player does not save your position in CD or MP3 CD playback when you turn it off. That's a major pain, especially if you have a long list of tracks.Another gripe I have is with navigation through the CD. If your MP3 CD has many tracks (I have one with 134), then finding the chapter you want to start at, if not early on, is going to take time. Quickly entering a track somehow would have been better, maybe via use of arrow keys that increase/decrease numbers in hundreds, tens, and ones place.Overall, this player does the job, but the problem with losing your spot during playback if you power off is a major nuisance."
5,Coby Mp3 Player,"Hi ,this is by far my best purchase of the Year!....I am so enjoying my Coby Mp3 portable combo...Thankyou"
5,Coby MP-CD450 works great,"Product works just as desired (and as advertised). Most importantly, when I first received it, it wouldn't work, but Amazon made a very rapid replacement at no cost whatever. You can't beat that kind of service."
3,boom box expo,This unit is very good for cds and tapes. The radio/tuner is not very good. It picks up one staion for almost the enitre width of the band. Even with the antenna it still does this. I can't listen to my favorite station on this boom box. I have to listen on my old boom box or my old Sony cd clock radio. Needless to say I am disappointed I have to keep old stuff around to listen to the radio. I thought this new boom box would fill all my needs.
1,Coby MP CD450 Portable MP3/CD plauyer with AM?FM tuner and cassette dec,"I cannot give this item any rate except zero. I take very good care of items such as this because I am an avid cd, cassette, mp3cd listener. I have purchased 3 different ones from Amazon, a Bonn, Phillips and Coby(which I thought would be the best) However, the cassette decks in each of these items died with 6 months. Bonn and Phillips are still working very well with the cds and mp3cds. BUT COBY CASSETTE AND CD AND MP3CD NO LONGER FUNCTION. Very dissappointed since I had always purchased Coby when I wanted a radio or cassette deck. I just wanted you know how disappointed I am in this product and no longer feel that its quality is the same as it was in the past and cannot be relied on."
1,Risky purchase - defective CD door,"I've had two of these fail with the same problem. When a CD is inserted, it searches and then flags the error 'nod' indicating no disk was found. The CD door is defective and Coby Support wouldn't fix this after only 7 months (they claims it's a 90 day return policy). As an alternative to this, I would suggest one of the following:Supersonic SC-183UM PORTABLE MP3/CD/WMA PLAYER, CASSETTE RECORDER, AM/FM RADIO & USB/SD/MMC INPUTSNaxa NPB-250 AC/DC Portable MP3/CD Player with AM/FM Stereo Radio and USB Input/SD/MMC Card Slot"
5,"its a nice player,from Amazon","I got this player for my wife ,and she likes it , she play mp3 on it,We got it at Amazon"
4,Too good to be true,"That could describe the protagonist as well as the book. Adam is almost too perfect, sometimes I doubt he's human. He could have been an interesting character but for me, he becomes way too bland as opposed to Daniel who appears midway into the story. Or even the other people populating the story.It was gladdening to see how the characters grew from whence we last saw them in It Had To Be You -- Sheila, Martin, Blaine, Jeremy...But surrounding Adam with these colorful characters just emphasizes how almost two-dimensional he is. From the returning cast, Jeremy seems to be the only that regressed rather than progressed. He was a better drawn character in the first book, I think.But hey, I'm a sucker for a fairy tale, especially when boy gets boy in the end. Yay Adam and Jeremy!"
5,"A smooth, enticing, wonderful read!","The plot development was superb, the characters' thoughts and actions were clearly illustrated, and I couldn't put this book down! I espeically liked the way Beck slowly developed the interplay between Adam and Jeremy so that its build-up became the seam that tied the pages of circumstances together. Kudos to Beck and I hope for another tome soon!"
4,Kiss my Tiara,I haven't read a book like this in a long time. Gilman makes sense of all the things we women do such as plastic surgery and dieting. I highly recommend this book for all women.
2,"Started it laughing, finished it angry","Susan Jane Gilman is obviously a gifted writer with a great feel for combining outrage with humour, but all in all, I was a pretty disappointed.When I bought this book, I was expecting a funny, smart, insightful treatise on feminism in 2001. It started out great, but by halfway through had devolved into what I can only describe as a myopic political rant. While I agree with most of Gilman's sentiments, the message was clear that if I didn't agree with all of it 100%, I was somehow letting down the sisterhood.I started this book laughing and ended it angry. Goddesses are a vibrant, diverse, and colourful lot. Trying to paint us in black and white will never do us justice."
5,A book for every young woman,"This book was a total wake-up call! It's more of a hilarious rant than a serious feminist text, but we all need hilarious rants once in a while. It reminded me that there is a wealth of publications out there to make us better wives, girlfriends, and lovers, but no one's really told us how to be better PEOPLE. It's a cold splash of water in the face for those who really need it."
2,Not what I expected...,"This book was chosen for my book club, and not a single one of us liked it. My book club is made up of very diverse women; among us we have a Women's Study Professor, Adult Toy Store Owner, School Teacher. All of us are strong, professional, educated, fun women. We all felt this book was a total waste of time. We agree that more women should indulge and have fun... but we didn't get this message from the book at all. It didn't feel like the author had a single original thought of her own, it was like 'bad bumper sticker' writing. We did enjoy the few quotes from her grandmother, but that was about it. I can't recommend this book."
4,Goddesses everywhere will roar with laughter...,"Oh my Goddess! What a hootin' & hollerin' funny book this is! Trying not to laugh out loud on a darkened international flight while fellow passengers were sleeping was near impossible. This book is fun and is written with intelligence and great humor. Yet it still manages to address some real issues that women should take note of, from asking for raises, negotiating better salaries at job interviews, to breaking off relationships cleanly and maintaining a body weight that's equal to your IQ-Right On Sister! Her advice though written through the heavy veil of humor, I found to be real, thought provoking and sensible. Unlike her memoir, Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress, which was very much a ""chick read"", I think men who are comfortable with themselves, love women, have a good sense of humor and don't take themselves too seriously will enjoy this book too. It's just plain funny."
2,Lacking a Joie de Vivre,"Okay, I have a tiara (actually 2) and a certain attitude. But this edgy, rather mean spirited tome was a mistake for this reader. The wit (and occasional wisdom) of the author was lacking a certain joie de vivre, that made the book about as interesting and fun as reading a technical manual with horrible language stuck in for fun? I could NOT resist the title, but if I'd opened it and flipped a bit I would never have bought it. Oh sure, she make some good points - and I agree with at least half of them. Probably I'm a generation removed from the author and not exactly the target audience. But I sure wouldn't want my son taking up with her. I'll be sending this on to a buddy in New York to see if it is worth getting translated. If you are more a member of the Menopausal Mafia and are looking for something fun, naughty but NICE, try instead the two Sweet Potato Queen Books."
2,Trying to be a Sweet Potatoe Queen,Ok - I have read two of the Sweet Potato Queen books and adored them. This one is doing a poor imitation - read about half of the book and put it on the shelf. Yawn!
1,Offensive!,"After reading ""THe Sweet Potato Queens"" trilogy I was thirsty for some more of Jill Conner Browne's quick wit and hilarious stories. Amazon recommended ""Kiss My Tiara"" based on my past purchases. I was SORELY disappointed. This book is offensive to say the least. The author is obviously an angry liberal who needed an outlet and wrote a book because nobody wanted to listen to her garbage. This is nothing compared to the sweet potato queen's empowering female stories. Sadly, I tried my best to finish this book but was unable to and had to do the worst thing possible for a book lover, I had to throw it away. I was just too afraid that if I let it live someone else might read it or worse yet, may think I actually agree with it just by mere fact that I own it. I can't say enough about this depressing, angry tirade of a book!"
4,Favorite Magazines!,"These devices are almost five times faster than popular 802.11b devices, yet 100 percent compatible because they share the same 2.4 GHz radio band."
5,I'm Blown Away!,"This book is great! I'm still laughing! As a study in fast comebacks, witty returns and all-purpose broadsides to fire off during the teeth-gritting aggravations of so many social situations women endure as a side effect of life, this is ingenious! I don't think I've ever combined laughing this hard with learning so much of the ""Yeah, that's true!!!-style"" practical information! (Or used this many exclamation points in an Amazon review!) Short of nuclear weapons there's nothing more dangerous than a rapier wit. I wish I could be one of the assertive, fearless, never off-center types Susan Jane Gilman celebrates, but alas, I think it'd take more than a book---even a devastatingly funny and cut 'em off at the knees how-to manual like this one---to transform me...but maybe I'm learning!And to those who've read this book and know what this means: ""Suffer, baby!""Ha, I love it!"
1,Terrible,"Having read - and absolutely loved - Ms. Gilman's hilarious memoir, ""Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress"", I naturally expected this book to be a great read as well. I was sorely disappointed. Ms. Gilman's sassy style gets lost in a sea of trite ""you-go-girl"" cliches. As the pages turn, Gilman's voice just gets angrier and angrier. Every other sentence is prefaced with ""Yeah, well..."" The writing is terrible, the editing is sloppy...I could go on forever. Grandmother's quotes were wonderful, but otherwise, this book was difficult to take. Gilman makes it abundantly clear that only as long as you share her extremely liberal views - this coming from someone who considers herself moderately liberal - can you make it into the Goddess Club. After the first twenty or so pages it began to irritate me. This is not a manifesto on how to cultivate some ""girl power"" and exercise it, but rather an excuse for Ms. Gilman to hop on her soapbox and rant. I would suggest skipping this shallow read."
4,So smart!,"I recommend this book to any woman who demands to be treated like a Godess! Susan Jane Gilman discusses so many ""taboo"" woman's issues with such great insight. She says what we're all thinking! ( or should be thinking anyway.) She points out the HUGE difference in attitude between men and women on issues like dieting, shopping, careers etc. I laughed until I cried! A must have book for the potential Smart Mouth Godess."
5,Excellent for All Beta Goddesses!,"This book should be a must read for older teenage girls. Yes, the language can be a bit raw, but trying to shelter your child or yourself from reality won't get you too far. You might as well live under a rock.Republicans, this book isn't for you (too complicated). I gave my 15 year old niece this book. It's good to see women thinking and acting independantly.Kudos to you, Ms. Gilman!"
2,About as subtle as a mack truck,"Sarah Jane Gilman does have some important points to make. It's a shame she does so in such an obnoxious way. As for the ""humor"" in this book, it escaped me. A liberal dousing of the ""f"" and the ""p"" words doesn't make something funny. BTW, I'm a total leftie single white female who works full time and goes to grad school, so I'm not sniffling because it offended my sensibilities -- more like it made me roll my eyes. I gave up after the chapter featuring 50 ways to say the word ""penis"" (ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)."
2,The tiara's not so sparkly,"""Feminism lite""... at best. While Gilman makes some noteworthy points to consider, she doesn't take them any further. She misses some valuable opportunities to really challenge traditional stereotypes and mindsets. It is not to be confused with any kind of feminist treatise. In addition, the editing is TERRIBLE!! Writing with an informal, conversational tone is great, but when the phrase ""Yeah, well"" is used so often (in an attempt to sound edgy and ""I'm-young-educated-and-I-have-an-attitude"") that it becomes tiresome, the style just grates. Save your money and go read Betty Friedan."
3,A little redundent,The idea is right but repeating the same concept six different ways gets annoying. I realize the book was created so the reader can jump around but I think that leads Gilman to reiterate her ideas to ensure she gets it in every chapter.Still a pretty decent read.
4,"Susan Jane Gilman can mentor both my daughters, and my son!","Thank you for valdiating my frankness and honesty for what it is-open and truthful and not just me being a smartass! Definately a book I will have both my daughters read. As well as my adult friends.Gilman's insight is honest and straightforward. Her Grandmothersounds as though she ruled her life rather than following it along. A great message for everyone, take control and don't feel bad about doing so."
2,Too Preachy,"I first read the author's follow up book Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress and absolutely loved it. It was a memoir that had stories of the author growing up in NY that had me cracking up. I bought this book Kiss My Tiara in a search for more and was very dissapointed. She doesn't go into stories at all. I could only read half way through and believe me I was pushing myself to do that because I loved her other book so much. In this book the author is just preaching to the reader over and over, telling me what to feel or think on issues like gay marriage or sex. How to be a liberated woman and a free thinker. However as a liberated woman and a free thinker, I found her writing just preaching and more distasteful was her opinion that to hold ideas or values contradictiory to her was rediculous, foolish or just plain wrong."
5,Funniest Book on Earth,"I read this book about 5 times before passing it on to a friend, with the explicit promise that she would pass it on as well.Kiss My Tiara made me want to jump right up and call my congressperson, attend a women's sporting event, send money to planned parenthood and just generally get active. It did this while also making me laugh so hard I'm sure I almost broke something.The book was hilarious, and because I agree with almost all of the author's views, I was (almost) never offended. However, if you are not a 100% crazy feminist liberal then you may find yourself wincing now and then.All in all, a must-read for liberal women and men who love a good laugh and a little political motivation."
3,Too lefty for me!,"On the whole, I enjoyed this book. While Ms. Gillman and I do not share all the same lefty views (afterall, I am a - do I dare say it - Republican, which is apparently the worst possible thing an educated white woman in America can be) I did enjoy her humorous spin on many things we babes are presented with on a day to day basis. Her comparision of a Jazzercize class with Nazi soilders goose stepping literally had me in hysterics. She has a definate talent for seeing and pointing out the ironies in life. I did very much tire of the repeated ""as my grandmother used to say-isms"" sprinkled more than liberally through the pages of this book and its not like anything presented was earth shattering new news. It was a pleasant enough way to spend some free time (although the last few chapters - particulary the one on religion dragged on and on and on...) but nothing I read here is gospel. Take it for the irreverant girl power book that it is."
2,Liberals Only Please!,"I read this book, about 25% was laugh out loud funny, the rest just frustrated me because she was so completely biased and dangit you just can't argue with a book!You don't read this for the advice,because it's pretty much common sense, you read it for her opinions and the way she writes, she's a smart alec and there's no getting around it. She makes fun of what she disagrees with and if you're even remotely right wing or conservative you won't enjoy the book."
3,"great title, some funny insights, but","a bit tough to take if you have an ounce of conservative ideology in your body. Heavy-handed leftist agenda marred what is otherwise a pretty funny book. Oh well, Hillary,Babs & Rosie will love it."
4,Empowering and hilarious!!!,Susan Jane Gilman puts in the right amount of attitude and humor that makes a book enjoyable and interesting. Found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. Definitely recommend.
4,Great for YOUNG women only,"For a woman older than 30, this book is like reading a Dick and Jane book in high school. While I agree wholeheartedly with much of what Gilman writes and found 2 or 3 interesting observations, as a woman in my late 20's, it didn't advance my thinking or stimulate me in any way. I was bored.However, this book is wonderful for a woman just out of high-school or in college. It's a practical instructional manual for life with advice and insightful commentary across a broad spectrum of issues affecting a woman's life. I would definitely buy this as a gift for a woman 18-22."
5,Completely Hilarious,"I started this book two nights ago and just finished it today. I couldn't put it down (I had to, though, 'cause of school and work and typical teenage life). The wit an humor is amazing and the way she empowered women is great. My boyfriend, of course thought it as a ""guy bashing"" book and my mother wasn't ready to hear my brother, 13, when reading out the table of contents, the title of the 8th chapter (i think it's the eighth). Anyway, I gave it to my ""sister"" who's now on the second chapter. It's an irresistible, can't-keep-your-hands-off-it book. And if you like to read something that's hilarious and witty, this is definitely for you!"
2,You don't need this book!,"If you are savvy enough to consider reading this book, then you don't really need it, especially if you are an intelligent feminist woman! The entire book is nothing but Gilman's whiny opinions, and believe you me, I already have my own on all the issues she presents (politics, careers, shopping, PMS, dieting, marriage, etc.). Gilman actually suggests that women should eat more ice cream as a show of solidarity to our sisters, the cows! Where did she get that from? I usually like reading feminist memoirs and well-researched books about pop culture, but this one did not work for me. Instead of Tiara, I highly recommend trying The Bust Guide to the New Girl Order."
5,"Burn ""The Rules"" and Laugh a While!!","It was the pink kissy lips that attracted me to the cover, and then, after reading the back of the book, I thought that this would make a nice gift for a friend who is going through a ""rough time"". I thought I should scan the book before giving it to her, and ended up reading it myself. Now, I have to buy her her own copy, as well as copies for my sisters, gal pals and nieces. After reading too many ""how to"" books and self-help fodder, finally, a book that tells the whole truth, holds nothing back, speaks the mind of most women and sounds so very much like ME! I have e-mailed all my fellow Goddesses and recommended this book for their pleasure and to enlighten them. I hope Ms. Gilman will have some speaking engagements in NYC because I would love to personally meet her and giver her a ""Thank You"" hug! Hoping she'll continue to write!"
4,Funny and on point,"This is a good read for those of us that are feed up with the pop culture we live in. She discusses topics that are relevant to us, such as independence, feminism, etc in a fun and delightful manner. I would recommend this for those that want to have a good laugh as well as reaffirm (or realize)their beliefs about pop culture, family, independance, marriage/dating, and politics. She is VERY opiniated and is not fond of republicans. I would have gave it a five, but there was quite a bit of language, which was a turnoff for me."
2,Not for me,"Kiss my Tiara was not what I was expecting at all. I'm a happily married thirty something with children Catholic Republican and I was quite disappointed. My views of being a smartmouth goddess differ from Ms. Gilmans, but hats off to her for getting out there with her opinions."
1,ruled by emotions,"Let's grow up ladies. Let's be truly free, not ruled by our emotions. This book is embarrassing. How silly she makes us all look. A woman can be a smartass and still kick others, all while being refined and humble at the same time. Sleeping around, ordering dessert and getting a raise will not really be helpful, it might just make you feel a little better, for now."
1,On my bottom 10 list,"I picked up this book because the title caught my attention, and now I realize why you should never judge a book by its cover. At first I enjoyed the book and Gilman's wittiness, and I was happy that this wasn't another typical male bashing feminist book. However, the further I got into the book, the more annoyed I became with Gilman and her ideas...and the more it seemed to bash men. Her sarcasm quickly became overbearing. She also seemed to try too hard to be politically correct (so much so that it was distracting), but then contradicts her pc-ness by blaming the Republican party for almost everything that is wrong with this country (not all of us are anti-woman pro-lifers).It's an ok book for a light read, but I wish I had saved my money for something that really would have enriched my life."
1,Not For Me!,"While Kiss My Tiara is most definently the empowering manifesto it tries to be for some women, others will be vastly disappointed and instantly stricken my the lack of class the ""Smartmouth Goddesses"" posess. As a southern, upper class, Republican girl, I had a lot of trouble foregoing the social graces I have had instilled in me from the womb. So girls like me, steer clear of this book. The rest of you, have fun with it!"
3,Queen Amidahla Costume not for tall people,"I bought this originally in the standard size thinking it probably runs large since it looks like it from the picture.....WRONG!!! I am 5'9 and it was over a foot short from the ground and the sleeves only a little over my elbows. Costume Craze was great though and exchanged for the larger size - which still is not floor length as the picture shows, so I will be adding lots of material. Not Costume Crazes fault but the Rubies brand that made this outfit. Looking forward to celebrating at our Star Wars Holiday Costume party!"
2,Too short.,"The costume is nice, but the lenght is too short, I am regular height 5.5 and it needs round 15 cm. More to look nice."
2,Poor Quality,The item is a typical Halloween costume made to be worn only a few times and consists of cheap material which is expected. However the item in the packaging was NOT the item pictured. It was truly sub-par and disappointing.
2,"Way, way too short!","I saw the reviews about this being too short but figured I'd be okay- I'm only 5'3"". Nope! This ""adult"" costume hit about mid-shin length for me, which translates to being about 6 inches or more too short. Pretty disappointing since I definitely couldn't wear it."
3,Great for short people,"I purchased this costume with the intent to add around 2 feet of black fabric to the bottom (I was Queen Amidala on stilts for a Star Wars themed party). I purchased the ""Large"" as it was the only size available and I was in a time crunch. I thought it would have been extremely large and I would have to nip and tuck it in the back and was ready to do so until I tried it on. I am 5'1, 105 lbs and it..fit..perfectly. As in, the costume definitely runs really small. It stopped right at floor length so I can understand why the other reviewer would claim that it was too short. The headpiece did not come with a jewel (which I didn't care too much for) but it also cracked realllly easily. I even blamed my son for sitting on it! It's a fleece-type material so it will get really hot. Overall, it served its purpose and the look carried off."
3,Disappointed,The Costume we received was very dissapointing. It was nothing like the picture there was no black accents or black cuffs or the bottom black skirting. It also did not have the black designs on the neck piece. Plus the mask we received was missing the stone out of the front and was missing one of the cushions that protect you face. After much modification my wife and I got the costume to look like the picture. We were very disapointed in what we received compaired to the picture.
5,Great item,"As a senior citizen, who has enjoyed sex since before most of you were born, I'd like to say that I ordered this item a few days ago and it came in yesterday. I'm more than pleased with the item and wish I had used it 55 years ago when I first began experimenting. Last night was a great experience for both of us. I'll be a regular user of this gel in the future."
1,Makes me jumpy,"I tried this after seeing a review under Isocort, which most people agree isn't working too well after the reformulation. The problem is that if you have adrenal problems, you don't want adrenaline. The active ingredients for this, as written on the bottle, are listed as ""Adrenal Cortex Extract and Multi-Glandular Complex (liver, lung, pancreas, heart, kidney and spleen)."" The multiglandular complex is the problem. Taking this feels like drinking three gas station-size cups of coffee in a row and is totally counter-productive for someone like me who's trying to heal my adrenals. I will have to throw it away."
1,disappointed,"the word ""assorted"" led me to believe I was to receive the stack of 5 but in various colors. Would not have paid $6.00 for 1 ashtray"
2,Not what I ordered.,"This is the second time I ordered an ash tray from this company. Both time I received a 3"" ashtray and not the 4"" one pictured and described."
1,Don't be fooled like I was,"The photo and careful wording led me to believe that I was buying 5 colorful ashtrays. I received ONE black ashtray! Would have done much, much, better at the 99 cent store."
3,Too Basic,"Decent guide for meditation, but without the use of chakras and understanding the purpose of meditation it's almost useless. But still, a good basic guideline."
4,Deep Meditation,"This is an informative and instructive book that makes the art of meditation an obtainable goal. I was pleased with how simple the steps were and how easy to practice on my own. I recommend this book to all those caught up in the daily rat race as a wonderful way to step back, breathe, and relax."
5,Best Game I Know Of,"Soccer Slam is the best game i know of, the reason for that is that the game has awsome high kicking actions. Another reason is that the game has great graphics so you can see the awsome moves more clearly. It also has highly animated characters with ript mucles. Thats why I think Soccer Slam is the best game I know of."
2,very disappointed!,"i ordered this game for my nephew who had already played this game previously on another game system and after about 4 days it stopped working. it really pissed me off because he was looking forward to getting it in the mail and was super excited and he used his own money to pay for it. of course i couldn't return it, which was a let down so i doubt i will ever order a game from here again."
2,Not as good as FIFA,I rented this to see how it compared to FIFA. I think FIFA is a lot better. Defenetly rent this before you buy it. Also FIFA world cup is coming out in april.
3,Goalie practice.,"I bought this for goalie practice ,so the girls would get usedto play in net ,it could be a little more softer."
3,the kids love it.,"I bought this for my son's indoor team. Turns out they play a version of indoor soccer called Futsal that uses a heavier ball that does not bounce like a regular soccer ball. However, we use this one at practice and the kids love it."
1,Soft Kick Fabric,Unfortunately the seam began to separate after the first game. The ball was use by fourth and fifth graders in an indoor intramural soocer league.
4,Re-released as The End Is Here,"This is a great album by one of the greatest bands of all time but really only of interest to collectors now, as it was re-released in 2004 as ""The End is Here"" (available on Amazon), which included one new bonus track ""The Cross of St. Andrew"" as well as a second CD of a live recording of the band's final concert on November 22, 2003 at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, Colorado.""The End is Near"" does have a 14th bonus track; however, it is simply a recording of several minutes of several people laughing."
4,accidental find,"We first found this video at our library and I was surprised by how much my kids love it. They giggle at the cat and like to watch him work the contraptions. I thought the video was a little corny at first, but they really enjoy watching it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the Baby Einstein videos."
5,A Nice Change of Pace,The kids were entralled by Max the Cat. It was nice to have an alternative to the Baby Einstein videos. The graphics were interesting and the music was not irritating or jarring (unlike some kids' videos).
3,Not well suited for toddlers,My two year old is not interested in the video. I think this would be excellent for a younger child. The video is more along the lines of Baby Mozart than something geared for toddlers. The parents guide was not in the DVD case.
2,"Sorry, not her best.","Henry O visits Hawaii to try to find the cause of her husband's death. There is a conglomeration of characters, way to many for me to keep track of. Too much description of Hawaii's flora and fauna. Too much repetition of facts and events that had already occured. I skipped over a lot of the last several pages just to get this one done."
5,A Great Find,"I don't like mysteries series that are gimmicky, and Carolyn Hart is a find: classic and classy, a bright, articulate protagonist who brings emotion as well as intellect to the table. The characters are well drawn, the mystery nicely done, and the setting beautifully drawn. I'll be reading more Carolyn Hart"
5,A real page-turner,"Henrie O still mourns the loss of her husband Richard. She has always assumed that his death was accidental, but an anonymous note to her implies that he was murdered. She can do nothing but follow up on this note and investigate Richard's death. Doing so involves trips to Texas and Kauai where she confronts Richard's friend Belle whom he was visiting at the time of his death. Henrie O had always been afraid that Richard's involvement with Belle was more than platonic and she vows to find out the truth behind their relationship, as well as the identity of the person who murdered Richard. There are no end of suspects on the island, all of them Belle's family or employees, and Henrie O has her work cut out for her trying to discern which one killed Richard. As always, author Hart crafts a well-written book and this one has an added emotional intensity because of Henrie O's love for her late husband. The setting of Kauai just adds to the ambiance of this excellent mystery."
2,book badly in need of an editor,"While this book contains a great deal of information, sifting it from the confused writing style used to explain the information is the major challenge. The information is good and often illuminating, however it reads like a legal document. As noted above it badly needed an editor."
1,Vapid Take on a Fascinating Subject,"What could be more interesting than a look at medieval outcasts in a time of conform or get roasted on a spit? The subject deserves a better telling than this collection of run-on sentences. The text is cobbled together from contemporary accounts of crime and punishment lifted from the annals of history. The chapters are laid out as if there is meant to be some coherency to the subject matter. There is a bit but not much as the subject of heretics, for example, can jump from treatment in the year 850 to 1450 with little regard to the subtleties of cultural change during the interim period. It's as if the book was written by a scholar who forgot to take his Ritalin. The information is so poorly organized that it is hardly memorable. I came away with a few nuggets but I wouldn't recommend the book."
5,hes a good singer,"hes a good singer/artist and has good songs. you should get this album cause its good, especially the 1st 2 songs"
4,Good introduction to the Dutch,"If you're new to the Dutch, this is the book for you. Clear, very complete and easy to follow. Covers all variations. I'm very satisfied with it."
5,Douglas Adams - a Master at work.,"Simply the greatest PC game I have ever played. It's difficult, it's infuriating, it makes you want to kill the damn robots but it's the funniest thing I have ever seen - although I hesitate to say it I include the Hitchhiker's Guid to the Galaxy in that.Adams humour runs through the game like a solid backbone and is supported by an excellent cast of voices hailing from the Monty Python team. You'll recognise more and mroe of them as you progress.There is no better Douglas Adams writing out there. Get the game if you are a DNA fan or just like good humour! But you won't get ANYWHERE without a hint book 0 it's THAT hard!"
4,Gripping and enchanting,"This is the fist Patricia C. Wrede book I ever read. Once I finished this one, I couldn't wait to find the other three books!"
5,Magical reading,"Although I didn't read the first two books in the tilogy, I was hooked on the first page of Calling on Dragons. Morwen leads a hard life as a witch and owner of not one but nine talking cats. Her life only gets harder when she; a six-foot, blue, talking donkey; a magician named Telemain; Queen Cimorene; two of Morwen's cats; and Kazul, King of the Dragons set off on the task of retrieving the sword of the Enchanted Forest. Along the way, they encounter spells, fire witches, wizards, and mud, which make their expedition difficult. Will they succeed and live to tell the tale?"
5,Great!,"In the third book, you get to see the adventuresthrough the veiwpoint of Morwen. This is a plus, becausenow we get to hear what exactly her cats are saying.A good, entertaining read, very fun!"
4,The Enchanted Forest Chronicles is the BEST book I have read,"Although Calling on Dragons isn't the best book in the series, I certainly enjoyed it. My personal favorite of the series is ""Dealing With Dragons"" but ""Calling on Dragons"" is well worth reading."
5,A surprise around every corner,"The sword of the Enchanted Forest has been stolen by tricky wizards trying to capture the castle from Mendebar and Cimerone, the king and queen of the forest. The only hope of saving the forest is by sending Cimerone and her friends to find the wizards and the sword. The group that was sent to save the sword is not a likely bunch of heros, but they would have to do. Along with the queen, was her good friend Morwen the witch and two of her seven talking cats, a wizard named Telemain whose theories are much more confusing then they have to be and and 6 foot blue flying donkey-rabbit named Killer! This book is filled with non-stop surprises! With this plot and these characters I found this book very interesting and fun to read."
4,Breathless,"All the chronicles of these four books are just too hard to get away from. I read them and I just can't stop. After Calling on Dragons I just had to know what was going to happen to King Mendanbar! Trust me. If you like Fantasy, you'll love these four books!"
4,The sword is gone,"Well. my story is Calling on Dragons. Its about wizards trying to take over; so they steal the sword. They are trying to get it back. Well Kazul , King Mandabar, Cermany, Tellmin, and Moren are at it again. Now they are after the sword.My favorite part was when I found out that the wizards go through mouse holes. I think doing that would be cool. The wizards go through mice holes to steal the sword. They did make it, and they did steal the sword. That is my favorite part."
4,Works well on dried wood.,"I had the usual wedge splitter, but it never did a decent job on some of the big stuff. This new wedge, I just hit the wood first with my axe to start a small crease, then use the sledge hammer and this wedge and it does a WAAYYY better job of splitting then a regular wedge. It worked on pieces larger that 18"" in diameter. Very happy with it."
4,Beefy,"Rather indestructible, I used these for splitting a few logs and also taking out some rotting stumps. With a sledgehammer and this splitter wedge, you can reliably split logs up to 16"". Be careful with too much of this, it takes a toll on your back. I'd invest in or borrow from the neighbor a hydraulic splitter for really big jobs."
4,"Hilarious, as usual","The part where Joel is inside the box, pounding the ceiling, and yelling ""I'm huge!"" alone makes this worth watching. This is yet another extremely hilarious episode of MST3K"
4,MST3K,Wish this was out on dvd. I don't even own a working vhs player. Got this tape so if it never gets released on dvd I always have a good source for copy to be dubbed.
1,NO.....Sorry I cant rate this good even with MST3K,I have rented this but do not own it. This movie is about a soldier turing into a giant after crossing the line at a ATOM BOMB experment. The plot is stupid and MKS3K realy cant make this movie any more watchable. The movie is just not worth the tme. I rate MITCHEL as the BEST
1,MSC is Terrible Humor. Not Funny.,"Don't buy this video. It's not funny at all. What's fun about sitting and watching lowbrow quips being made about schlocky albeit classic sci-fi and horror movies? Answer: N-O-T-H-I-N-G. My advice, go to Amazon video and buy ANY movie spoofed by MST, invite friends over to watch and make your own jokes. At best, enjoy these movies for the cheese that they are. You'll have enough fun just doing that. MST is clearly for the non-creative wallflower who sadly and vicariously enjoys life at the expense of everyone else's cackling whims. Zero, Zero, ZERO."
3,Kafka for young readers,This is an introduction to the life of Kafka for Jr. High School readers. Ages 10-13. It's very good for that age group.
5,Very Well Done,"THis book examines the so-called fued between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. It follows the girls lives from childhood, to their acting careers, and to their battles with their grown children. It is extremely thorough Mr. Considine interviews numerous actors, families, and the lovers of both Davis and Crawford. If you are a Joan Crawford or Bette Davis fan, this is the book to get"
4,This Old Boat,I saw this title on several of the boating sites. Found it on Amazon at a great price. This is a must have book if you do any of your own boat repairs. It is somewhat basic in places but has lots of tips and pictures to help you. Great for novice or if you are thinking of buying an older boat.
2,Not complete,"I found that the book lacked certain basic information. for example: when restoring an old boat, one must typically contend with transporting the boat (perhaps mention of trailer, and cradle designs), or de-masting and storage, removing the multi-layers of antifoulant paint, correct the grazing of the gelcoat. For the interiour, one may decide to substitute teak for mahogany, white oak, etc, but there is no mention of altenate woods for cabinetry and interior work. For the deck anti-skid, how can you mold parts of the missing anti-skid, if you dont want to use threadmaster M. I just found the book a little bit less than basic."
2,Pipe repair kit,My order took a long time arriving and did not work as stated on advertisement. I ended up having to hire a plumber since I am a female widow and didn't know how to fix the leak any other way.
2,Product didn't work as expected,"Followed the directions very carefully, was unable to successfully stop a pinhole PVC leak. Product hardened onto the pipe like steel, but still continued to leak through the tape. Waste of money and $12."
3,NOT AN EXAGGERATION,"I actually counted the 320 books of my collection, including some other books by Faber&Faber, to say this: Although the text is actually rich and enlightens the otherwise dark style of Mr. Herzog, the quality of the book is extremely poor, the poorest among the books I own. There's something funny about the way the edges were cut, the first two pictures (pgs. 40-43) are actually the same, and in general, the images are poorly, poorly printed. It would have been wiser to just skip pictures for this volume and leave the text. So, again, If you're a fan of Mr. Herzog, I definitely suggest this book (I'd actually give 5 stars to Paul Cronin), but if you're picky about your ""reading experience"", you'd better buy something else."
3,Good Summary of 2000 Years of History,"I wanted to read this book prior to a business trip to India to get a better understanding of culture. I like this series of books and this one did not disappoint. The last quarter of the book, which talks about 20th century history, gets a little slow."
2,"No, too expensive","No, very high price. It is little thicker than other pan drips but still needs heavy scrubbing. It does not make cleanning the stove any easier."
4,Just a summary of what's in the book,"I don't own this book yet, but can give you a bit of description (more than what's provided at any rate).""Joen's book teaches you to draw blocks from all of the basic patch families (4-patch, 5-patch, 7-patch and 9-patch). Learn to blend blocks from the same patch family to form new, exciting designs. Includes more than 150 traditional, historical and original block designs. No math! No graph paper! No fuss! Includes gallery of quilts.""I'm sure this book is excellent. Joen Wolfrom is a pro; check out her book ""The Visual Dance""."
2,This was not the correct part.,This part was not the correct part needed to instal the aftermarket radio. Ended up sending back and going to Best Buy.
1,Incorrect Item,"This is a REVERSE wiring harness. It is a replacement harness for the stock wiring harness, NOT for connecting to an aftermarket stereo harness!"
3,"Classic, but not Best of...","This is a compilation of some of Country Joe's late 1970's work for Fantasy Records. Several of the tracks are found (with better sound) on his excellent ""Paradise with an Ocean View"" CD. The rest of the music is fine, though it is an inadequate compilation that does not do him justice. But, as most of this work is out-of-print, it's what we have to work with. ""Space Patrol,"" my favorite track here, is actually an anti-war song told from a soldier's point of view, something that McDonald (who served in the U.S. Navy) excels at."
1,Why oh why can't we give negative stars?!?,"Brutally honest and insightful? My God, man, what drugs are you on? This book is a perfect example of Freedom of the Press run completely amuck. One thing that our founding fathers should have written -- Freedom to do what you want but don't be an idiot suckered into ultra-extreme leftist thinking and especially don't publish books written in that brainwashed frame of mind!!!!"
1,Can I give half a star?,"In order to respond to this book and this review, I need to first stop shaking my head and stop sighing. I just spent 40 minutes up at the bookstore reading this book just for the mental exercise. What a bunch of absolute baloney. The mere fact that he calls it the ""truth"" is funny as well. I could sit here and poke holes in what I read for hours on end. But after reading the other ""review"" here I didn't even feel like wasting my time. So Bush did all this to impress Jesus! HAhah. Now c'mon ! You can't possibly believe yourself. Has pot really become that bad for your brain cells? It's a shame that wacky professors (mr. Nash anyone) can peddle this joke as a book and with a straight face. I noticed the last time he got an award was 1982, that must have been before Reagan and the borg attempted to have him assimilated. If you buy it, make sure to put tin foil on your head so the bush administration can't read your mind from their secret HQ on the planet Ridiculon. Pathetic."
2,A Montage of Lost Acid Dreams Wrapped in Brain Tissue,"The are two ways to look at this book, either of them will leave you with a headache. You might actually be able to make more sense out of this book if you read it back to front. The plot, if there is one, is a Maltese Falconesque brain of Franz Kafka which everyone wants. Two characters here represent Sidney Greenstreet (The Candyman) and Peter Lorre (Thermidor).Everyone else is along for the laughs, if you can find them. The book appears to be written in one continuous session like ""On the Road"" without all of the beatnik mystique. It reads like an acid-trip with a speed chaser. What it's suppose to be is the bottom line question. Though it would warm the heart of any 50s 'nouveau roman' writer or semi- practicing Dadaist.Take two beers, hit yourself on the head, and don't sleep for three days and you should be able write something better than this. If you can't, finish the six pack and go to bed."
2,Poor outing for Aylett,"After the first dozen pages of this book, try putting it down and switch instead to The Crime Studio, Bigot Hall or Slaughtermatic. The difference in quality is striking.This book feels like it's been thrown together with little care or attention. I really enjoyed other books by Aylett, but have noticed the quality drop with each new book. Is he just running out of ideas?"
2,Bleck,"I thought I was a pretty open-minded person a couple of years ago, but I either never was, or I have become less so in my older age. ""Atom"" by Steve Aylett really put my senses to the test, however.This book, after just a few pages in, seems more like a joke on the reader than a novel. It almost reads like a Burroughs opium nightmare about a private eye, or a Gertrude Stein poem about one. There is no plot and even a nonlinear thinker will become lost amid the electron-induced battling plotlines.I could be wrong, I hope I am, but I have a feeling that the people who loved this book and gave it excellent reviews were just not up to the task of admitting it didn't make much sense."
1,Another disapointed lousy CCR collection again!,I rather you take my advice recommend Chronicle Volumes One and Two and hear the essential CCR collection. If you are a Creedence Clearwater Revival hardcore music fan. This compilation disc only has 14 song tracks included here!
1,Enhanced? Make That CENSORED!,"all the same tracks, but out of order! the order always so carefully prearranged, vocals and guitars too too pretty with echoes and blurred, the edges the personality and more gone all gone, gone missing also the one English word Juanes recorded I know about to great and perfect effect. I was waiting for that part too. MANGLED! Wonder how they got this mess of medddling past Juanes or maybe they didn't try and don't have to. Buy Colombian not USA in this instance! Get the original UNINHANCED EKHYMOSIS in green without the video and cover pics. Pics are rehashed and BAD too! Unless like me you want everything possibly associated with the man. And the proof, the ******* proof that that notorious one word in Ingles being I guess ""potent"" not found as such in another language yet replaced by...... well it cannot be replaced only debased with the trying POR FAVOR! NO MAS NO MAS!!!!"
4,A good Read,"Published posthumously, and not one of Shellabarger's critically acclaimed works, this remains an interesting pastiche of turn of the 19th Century America.True, those familiar with Shellabarger's novels of the 16th, 17th and 18th Centuries may find this one incongruent with his other works, yet TOLBECKEN remains a well written, well characterized novel that spans the decades.The story follows the life of young Jared Tolebecken; his love for childhood sweetheart Calrice, his failed marriage to Frances Oliver, and his WWI exploits.A good read."
5,Ars Gratia Arteest,"David does it all, and does it so well. His version of 'Summer Wages' will make you rush home and lock up your beloved, before some no-account low down false friend steals her away. Even if YOU don't want her any more. I've been a fan of Bromberg since Moses waded out of the bulrushes and the classic double 'How Late'll Ya Play 'Til?"" is my favorite of his old recordings. I always liked the 'studio' side best, but there's something to be said about the energy from the live recordings like 'Will not be your fool'. Since David doesn't make many live appearances any more, you might want to double your pleasure and grab both CDs while you've got the chance. Buy the CDs, then write David, tell him to get busy and whip up some more just like this."
3,Not too happy with this one...,"The description of this book would lead you to believe you would be able to write your own advanced scripts and really learn how to script under Win 2000.What you get are a lot of pre-made examples that are helpful but only explained on the surface. I would say this is surely not for first time scripters. When examples are given they are sometimes too simple to be usable and it isn't explained how to actually modify for something useful. For instance the example how to run a command in a script, runs notepad. This isn't useful. How about running a command and piping it's output to a file with variables in the command? This book covers a lot of topics, many very advanced but there is not enough instruction on how the parts actually work for creating custom scripts. Now I need to look for another book to use along side this with more actual explaination of syntax and script function."
2,"Good reference, but not that usefull","I purchased this book just to add to my scripting knowledge. What I found is that the information provided is really at a very basic level, with poor examples, and a lot of omissions.Although the author hit all of the major topics, the examples given, and explanantion of what was being done in the examples would have left me without a solid understanding of how to use them in the real world if I did not already know 90% of it. In addition, entire chapters on how to work with specific items skip the most obvious and simple methods of scripting how to work with those items.On a positive note, the index is accurate and makes it easy to look up a specific sytax when needed.In summary, it is decent as reference material, but don't rely on this book to teach scripting. You will be left with a lot of questions, overly complex methods of accomplishing goals, and no idea that many of these things can be scripted in ways never even mentioned."
3,Usable reference,"Not for the beginning scripter. The style is extremely terse. Sample scripts are not well commented and the support in the text is generally weak as well. However, if you are reasonably familiar with VBScript or JScript and WSH, you'll have no problem understanding the samples.The sample scripts are, in fact, the most worthwhile aspect of this book. Most are usable in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 as well. There's no CD-ROM included with the book, so be sure to download the sample code. The author provides the link on page X (yes, Roman numeral X) of the Preface.Jerry"
1,Could be much better,"This thick book has ended up to be fairly worthless for me. There are other books, even those half the size, that I use more often. Scripting in Windows really isn't that complicated, and most of what I need to know can be found on the web in minutes. A waste."
2,There Are Better Books Available,"The code examples in this book are too short and incomplete to be of real help to a real system administrator trying to implement scripting for the first time. For example, in trying to use ADSI (Active Directory Service Interfaces) the author has you flipping back and forth between code fragments in Chapter 14 and the Appendix. In neither spot does he actually put it all together to demonstrate how you use the methods correctly. All you get are bits and pieces, with no good explanation. Your money would be better spent looking elsewhere for help."
3,Fair at best,"I am a skilled builder. I build boats, bows and guitars. There is very little that I find a challenge when it comes to contruction. Although this book contains a lot of interesting material, it seems that Mr. Berry knows a lot more about telescopes and optics than about how to write a clear design for contruction. In fact, some of his measurements will simply not work and need to be revised. If you choose to buy this book be prepared for some hard problem solving and be prepared to come up with some of your own solutions. I think the book would have been better if Mr. Berry had collaborated with a draftsman and someone who actually builds for a living. He should have given his plans to a novice and let them build his projects. They would have pointed out the shortcomings of his instructions and then he could have revised his book. It would change it into a must have book. Now...the book is fun, but be prepared for some frustration and a real, unnecessary challenge."
2,Instructions are poor,"I agree with Len Bast, the instruction are very poorly laid out and often contradict themselves. One of my biggest problems with this book was that for each telescope he suggests, he neglects to have a list of building materials and tools at the start of each chapter, which is a huge mistake. As mentioned previously, the plans quite often contradict themselves, or one of the accompanying photos or diagrams or else leave ambiguities that, to a novice builder, seem bewildering. Nevertheless, I did manage to build a working telescope from this book, so while it's not entirely useless, it could be much improved."
1,Goya Giant White Corn,"I was very disappointed with this product. First, I noted that while there was an indication that I was purchasing a 16 oz. bag, it was only 14 oz. At $9.99 per bag, this was especially disappointing. I bought a bag for myself and one that was part of a Christmas gift basket. I thought it would be fun to use the giant corn instead of traditional dried posole. I was very embarrassed when my friend told me that despite cooking the corn (to make posole) for some 10 hours, it never became tender and never ""popped"" open. I thought perhaps she cooked it at too low a temperature (not boiling it), so I cooked my bag and after 12 hours, the corn was still whole and very tough, never popped open, and did not absorb the flavors in the broth. I spent $20, plus shipping for the two bags. I would have definitely returned it if it had not been cooked, but there is no way to know in advance that one is purchasing a bad dry product, is there?"
4,Love them!,"I gave these to the 'ol lady for Christmas. She loves them, was exactly what she wanted and I picked them out!!"
4,Rather Enjoyable,"I have been quite happy with my Nokia E61i, which I have had for about a month. The ability to easily add applications from many that are available is really nice. The device syncs calendar and contacts with my Mac Book Pro (after getting the update from Nokia) far better than any previous previous device I have owned (Motorola and Palm Treos).The built in browser is quite good, but has a couple oddities and the e-mail application is not perfect. The good thing is I added the Opera Mini browser and I am incredibly happy. The Nokia Series 60 OS is solid and is a good platform for developers to build great applications. The addition of Nokia adding easy web access to Microsoft Live as well as Yahoo Go is also rather nice and easy if you use those services.I have also been really impressed with the camera."
5,this phone has wi fi. witch is very nice to have. not many cell ph. there making have wifi. ! surfs the web ok. useing apps drai,"great web surfer, not load for a cell ph. huge clculater look. better computer than cell ph . apps usaly run ok. the web site that are for beta or moble are the best . large files for reg home pc tend to boot you off the net.. otherwise it's a great web surfer and e mailing. push to talk is used by sprint and this ph will do everything.. ! i give it a ten . ph"
3,Good Bargain Bucket Book,"I was lucky enough to find this novella for a low price. The publisher's price is ridiculous (as is the price of most literature in this country!).The lower price also left me more open and feeling more generous towards this text. If I'd been unlucky enough to buy this at the publisher's price, I would have expected a MUCH better text.While the writing is crisp and stylish (as one would expect from a poet) the character analysis is lacking and occasionally immature. Why the author couldn't have taken another 100-150 pages to develop his characters is a mystery to me. He created them and yet seems to have lost interest in them by the end of the tale - even switching narrator for his final chapter - a move that is both unnecessary and unsatisfying.a 3 star rating."
4,"If you like music to be fun, this is your choice.","David Bromberg is a musical talent that for some reason has been relegated to a place of obscurity. His talent on string instruments is unquestioned, and his lyrics are hysterical. This album contains ""Bullfrog Blues"". This cut sums up everything that was hip in the late sixties, early seventies, and manages to do a pro-marijuana comment, anti-Hugh Hefner comment, mentions Kahlil Gibran, and somehow manages to tie this all into voyeurism and the blues. I have seen Bromberg twice in concert, and he performed ""Will not Be Your Fool"" each time with totally different lyrics. I do believe his version on this album is his bestinterpretation of this wondrful tune. Bromberg moves from country, to Delta blues to Electric blues, from mandalin to dobro to fiddle and seems to be master of all these strings. This is not music to be taken seriously, but music to listen to and realize how much fun music can actually be. What ever happened to David Bromberg?"
3,No Chubby Thighs?,"Too bad they split these volumes up. On vinyl, this album included the ironic ""Idol with the Golden Head"" and the delectably bluesy instrumental ""Chubby Thighs."" Because neither this Volume (1) nor Volume 2 has all the original songs on one CD, it gets only 3 stars. Had they all been here, this would be a definite 5-star CD."
2,Calories counted??!!,"Calorie counting is horrible, it does not even factor your body weight into concideration. Being 190lb I have to multiply the watchs reading anywhere from 1.5 to 1.8 to get even a ball park figure. (The heart rate however is dead on accurate)It's NOT compatible with most of the gear you will find in gyms. After learning more about them I would suggest investing in a POLAR brand heart rate monitor, as they will send your heart rate to the gear you are using in most gyms.The strap is comfortable and well built. Watch has a solid construction. Have not used alarm features. Batteries are CR2032, a common reasonably priced battery. ($3.99)"
1,Typical Actex textbook.,"Like all of the Actex texts that I have seen, ""Mathematics of Investment and Credit"" is cheaply produced and poorly presented. It covers all of the main areas of financial math: interest rates, annuities, bonds etc, and with worked examples, but even with the examples, I found the material to be poorly explained and often difficult to comprehend. There is a reasonably large number of exercises in this text. However, presumably because Actex also sells a solutions manual to accompany this book, the solutions are only given to selected questions and no working is provided.This is the textbook that was prescribed when I took Financial Mathematics at university. At the time, I found this book so difficult to follow that I ended up buying a second financial math text,Theory of Interest, and working from that instead. Without that second book, I don't think I would have done nearly as well in that unit."
3,M494 or FM 2 Exam preparer,"This textbook will prepare you for the FM 2 exam. I say prepare because the exercises in this tb are not equivalent to the hardness of the actual questions on the exam. If you really want to pass the exam (besides MEMORIZING THE BOOK), do seek other resources..besides that, cht 9 solutions are all wrong. Cht 6, 7, and 8 has some wrong and incomplete solutions. The newer edition (4th) also has the same errors."
3,"A quality presentation, but with many flaws","I just completed working though this book in preparation for the FM exam. While I though that the presentation of the concepts were straightforward, I found that the book was riddles with mistakes... not crucial mistakes, but errors in the examples that were clearly a result of the author perhaps entering a 10% when it ought to have been a 5% or the like. I am currently compiling a list to send him. Like I said, not fatal errors, but enough to be frustrating."
4,Do for exam success,good book with lots of worked examples detailing financial mathematics such as annuities and interest rates. Do all examples for exam success
3,Short Sampler,"This is a small sample of what CCR had to offer back in the 60's and early 70's. Chronicle, Vol. 1 would be your best choice since it contains all their Top 10 hits. One benefit this has over Chronicle Vol. 1 is that it includes Born On The Bayou and the long version of Suzie Q."
3,"It's okay, but, find original albums if you can","It's okay, but, find original albums if you can, as you get more great songs that have not been played as much. For example, ""it came out of the sky"" is never on any greatest hits album that I have ever seen, but, it is a great song on the cassette album ""Willy and the poor boys"""
5,cr fan,I was very impressed with my product.just like new.I will buy these products over again.I highly recommend it.
1,Deficient,"This is a skimpy album, both in term of number of songs or time-wise. Get Chronicle or one of the original albums, instead for a better overview of CCR."
2,Poor pruning book,"I have numerous gardening books and thought that this may be a good addition to my library. Unfortunately, not so. It is poorly written, in a very ""folksy"" way, and I doubt some of the advice given for particular plants. Plant coverage is limited to the more common varieties. Lastly, it is not in color and there are only sketches, no actual photos.Save your money and don't buy this book. If you really want a good pruning book, buy The American Horitcultural Society ""Pruning and Training"". It is well organized, great pictures and sketches demonstating what to do, expert instruction, etc."
3,A bit disappointed,Wish the book had more pictures instead of just written technique. I am a visual learner and pictures of the pruning process would have been more helpful to me.
5,brilliant writing and observation,This is a brilliantly written book. Keen observations of the tragic occupation of Vietnam by the French that are relevant to our occupation of Iraq. His tone is wise and witty. I plan on reading all of his writings after this experience.
4,I enjoyed this way of looking at Marketing,I picked up this book out of the blue and thought it could help me in a new marketing position I was starting. I was right. I learned so much while reading this book that I could hardly put it down. I am now using the principles in this book in my new position with success.
3,friends and acquaintances,I put the recommendations into practice and have had 50% success. The success came with the people wanting a free updated copy of a book that they had purchased. The downside was that none wanted to buy other books on sale. Mind you the list is whittled right down. I need to ignite them another way or start from scratch with a new lot and then get them to buy a second and third time.
3,"Flawed, but worth reading","I like the fire metaphor and agree with the underlying principles. But the book rambles on in sections and the examples used are almost exclusively based on Christians buying Christian products...he even uses Jesus of Nazareth as an example of how PyroMarketing principles were used to ""sell"" Christianity to the masses. He is aware of (and discusses) confirmation bias, but apparently not enough to prevent himself from doing it.However, as a blueprint for effectively marketing a product or service, it seems solid and replicable. I will definitely try it with my business and probably recommend it to others."
4,Not the best marketing book...but VERY useful,"First off....what's with all the complaints about the ""fire"" analogies given in this book. I personally think it puts you in a proper ""frame of mind"" as far as equating to real world marketing. This is what makes the book relevant as an example would be to find ""the driest tinder"" ....makes sense as what should be where your marketing dollars should be directed.I own many marketing books and this definately stands among the better ones.The only problem i have is the fact that if the author is an expert in marketing books (his occupation) Why has this book not ""caught fire"" in the marketplace?Makes you think"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Everything relavant to marketing can be learned in the left inside flap of the jacket, unless of course you are looking for a book on the science of building a fire. The author has no experience, he only uses 2 real world examples that he knows very little about, and nothing in this book is relavant to marketing. I want my money back."
3,Too Much Reference to Fire,"I have to concur with the reviewer who said that they felt there were too many references to fire in this book. I was quite clear about the concept of ""PyroMarketing"" after the first few pages. Unfortunately I soon discovered that metaphorical prose make up the bulk of the writing which is less of a manual on marketing technique than an inspirational musing on how to associate your potential customers with dry tender. The gist of this book is: Mass Marketing = BAD, Niche Marketing = GOOD. I give it 3 stars for at least getting this message through consistently (though repetitively).The Jack London story about ""The Man"" was the most memorable component of this book, but you know what? I wanted to read a good marketing book not an Arctic adventure gone wrong. I'm glad I checked this ""puffery"" laden morsel out from the library, because I would have been rather upset had I purchased it."
1,"Firefighters might enjoy this book, thats about it.","I admit, I didn't read the entire book. I tried to but it was just too difficult. By the third chapter, I just wanted to scream at the top of my lungs, ""I get it, I get the parallel between fire and marketing, can we please move on."" The content and general premise is okay, but the author seems so concerned sounding like an expert and less concerned getting his point across for the benefit of his audience.If you want to read some good books on customer evangelism check out: ""Purpose-Driven Church"" by Rick Warren, ""Creating customer evanglists,"" by Ben McConnell, and ""Selling the Dream"" by Guy Kawaski."
2,It was much too generalized,"I wanted to like this book...the first chapter or two makes sense...but it ended there. Too much story telling, too many references to fire, and too many connections to The Purpose Driven Life and The Passion of the Christ. It took me one day to skim through it looking for relevant material. I put it up for sale immediately.Try Ideavirus and The Tipping point."
5,the best marketing book out there,"Greg Stielstra's book on marketing is the best marketing read available today. Don't let the nay-sayers stop you from becoming the best marketing person at your firm. Greg's stuff is cutting edge, period. Buy it and pass it on."
5,"Wherefore art thou, Purdy?","If this book were Juliet, I'd be it's Romeo. There aren't enough superlatives I could lavish on Purdy's writing. There were so many ""AHA!"" moments when reading that my wife thought I was having an epileptic fit! Purdy's prose is superior yet completely comprehensible. The reader immediately sees his point. Beg, borrow or steal this book, it IS that good. The only negative (and it is a very small one) is the publisher's annoying advertisements spread throughout the book."
5,This is really different!,This is for me the first book on chess I have encountered that really puts first things first and explains a systematic method for thinking about any chess position. Even though the author makes very interesting remarks about strategical points he never forgets to remind you about the tactical problems on the board and a systematic way of taking care of these. For me definetely the most helpful book on chess that I ever read.
2,Asimov is much better,"I didn't really enjoy this... felt like I was having a lot of names and facts thrown at me, but I wasn't really getting a lot of UNDERSTANDING. Also, I just found it pretty boring to read. Asimov's ""A Short History of Chemistry"" is a much better basic intro, both in terms of helping you understand the important themes/points and also in terms of readability."
3,Why I haven't bought this book,"The 3 stars given are meaningless because I haven't bought this book. May be it deserves more, may be less. I just wish to explain why, although tempted, I haven't bought it.Roughly speaking, 90% of our chemical knowledge have been discovered in the 20th century. So I found the title ""...from Alchemy to the Buckyball"" most appealing. I thought : ""this is one of those rare books which discuss also modern chemistry"".When examining the index however, I haven't found the following names : Barton, Butenandt, Corey, Cornforth, Fukui, Haworth, Hoffmann, Lehn, Natta, Prelog, Robinson, Ruzicka, Taub,Wieland, Windaus, Woodward, Ziegler..., all Nobel Prize winners. Not to mention other outstanding chemists like Eschenmoser or Stork.This may be a very good book for the history of chemistry up to the beginning of the 20th century, it is not a history of the whole science of chemistry. So, with much regret, I did not buy it."
5,Great Collection of Standards,"I was fortunate to see Ms. Lettau in concert earlier this year and get a preview of many of these songs. And although everybody seems to be recording songs from The Great American Songbook these days, this is a worthwhile collection to get for both fans of these songs and of Ms. Lettau. Not as experimental as some of her previous collections, she puts her own mark on these songs, as on the upbeat ""Bye Bye Blackbird"", where she adds some great scat singing. Her accompaniment varies from a string orchestra to a jazz combo to a single instrument. On a great verson of ""It's Delovely"" she is only accompanied by a bass player, and that's all she needs. Her one offbeat selection here is ""(It's not Easy) Being Green"" from Sesame Street, and she makes it fit right in."
1,FORGET IT....,"Who ever put this kit together didn't know anything about WATERCOLOUR painting.1. The mixing pans are too small to use.2. There is no need for black or white in a true artists palette.3. Though the kit is intended for a beginner, the paints are of a really poor quality, and mine were kind of stale and hard.Shop elsewhere......."
5,Beatlesque melodies galore!,"What a superb, little-known ""lost"" classic album! If you enjoy Beatles music and wish there was more, look no further than this excellent, highly melodic masterpiece by Stealers Wheel. If all you know is ""Stuck in the Middle With You"", then you're in for a treat. Gerry Rafferty was at his peak as a songwriter at this time; most of his later stuff pales by comparison."
5,The blackbyrd greatest hits,The blackbyrd is one of the great funk bands. All their classic hits are on the CD. This is a great buy.
4,My kids love it,My kids love School House ROck. I play on occasion when they forget to click out of the program. Lots of fun.
5,munch it up!,"I absoulutley love Word Munchers. It is the coolest game. The fact you can play with or without troggles knocks me out. I also love how you can play by grade level. I'm in fourth grade, but sometimes I like to play 1st grade to cool off."
2,Alternative to novels; nothing practical or useful,This is a vain attempt to take a technical topic and present it in easy language. The author runs out of things to convey after the first 3 chapters
1,"His wife is a reviewer - and, she doesn't say so!","The fact that the authors wife has reviewed the book without revealing her relationship to the author does indeed suggest that Miller has a bit of the ""Lott"" in him. It is fine if your family reviews your work, but it is simply good form to inform others of this. (And, five stars - perhaps a bit of grade inflation.)This type of ""cheating"" really undermines the review process, so I would advise buyers beware. Perhaps your money is better spent elsewhere."
2,Better Options Available,"There are many useful game theory books on the market now, many of which are aimed at the lay reader. Nalebuff and Dixit is still the best non-technical introduction. At a slightly higher level, Dixit and Skeath is the gold standard. Gibbons, followed by Tirole, would round out the sequence.By the way, if indeed, as one reviewer claims, that Deb Felton Miller (a ""five-star"" reviewer) is Miller's spouse, then it does tend to vitiate the usefulness of the review process."
1,The John Lott/Mary Rosh Award Winner,"Nice review your wife wrote for you (see below, Debbie Felton Miller).Don't waste your money - the book is pabulum. Readers interested in game theory pitched at an introductory level should read the far superior Dixit and Skeath."
3,Works well but not built well,"The product works well, it has good suction and it sweeps as you move it, which does loosen the dirt before sucking it up.It isn't built well, I have had to put the brushes back together more than once."
4,W+P Bluewater Thermometer,"Product looks nice for the money and is easy to install on a bulkhead.I bought a set of three (barometer, time/tide,thermometer)"
3,The thermometer is attractive,"My review is being sought shortly following delivery. Frankly, I feel that a review should be requested AFTER knowing whether it works well... perhaps next year. However, the manufacturer has a nice reputation and I expect perfect results !"
2,"disappointed, but it works","Yes, these arrows fly well (though their stuff rubber fletchings have damaged the arrow rest on my bow and maybe skewed a few flights), and yes, they can take up a good beating. However, that's where their good attributes stop.The arrows I received look nothing like the ones in the picture; they are all black with permanent field tips and an orange plastic nook that doesn't fit the string (though that could just be a ""string is too thin"" issue, though I'd say my string was pretty thick... whatever). They are for meant for draw weights up to 25 pounds, but it doesn't say this in the description; my bow is 30-35 pounds, so that was a fail. They also have permanent field points that dull rather quickly.All in all, I was very disappointed with what I received, but hey, at least they work and the price was alright, though I would recommend investing a little more in aluminum arrows with feather fletchings instead."
2,Clear information required!!,First of all theses are fiberglass arrows not carbon fiber arrows. They come in 24 or 26 inch lengths and have permanent field tips. None of this is clear in the description. We had to return them as we needed 28 inch and specified as such in our order.
2,Fletchings are terrible,The fletchings on these arrows are made of rubber which damaged the coating on my compound bow string. It also caused noticably more damage to the arrow rest on my compound and my recurve bow. They don't fly very straight either because the fletchings hit my bow THAT much. I will never buy arrows with rubber fletchings ever again. They should be fine after I will be refletch them with feathers.
3,grandaughters practice,My grandaughter received a youth bow for Christmas with two arrows. She wanted more arrows so I saw these in amazon and ordered them for her. They shoot as well as her ability so she is very pleased with them.
1,Junk. Complete junk.,I could not be more dissatisfied with these arrows. They are absolute junk. Do not buy these. You are better off getting the three dollar arrows from Walmart.
3,"OK, not great quality.","OK, not a great buy.That is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more. I don't think more is necessary!"
1,dissapointed,I was very dissapointed with these arrows since they looked nothing like the picture or description. Not even the same brand. plain black with blue and white fletching.
4,Arrows,"My parents got me these because i love the hunger games. The work really well, and shoot straight and fast. They look nothing like the picture they are black with the blue and white feathers. The end tip is orange. But they are easy to spot, too. The problem i had with these was when all of the orange part where you hook it onto the string came off.all three broke off but i fixed two of them with super glue. One of them started cracking down the middle,and the feather started coming off. most of these things problably happened because i sucked at archery, i am really good now. So yes, i recommend these."
4,carbon arrows,"great product, very sturdy and beautiful arrows, the shaft has blue swirls and the feathers are green andwhite, great colors together, very happy with product"
3,ok but fletchings fall off easily,seem like decent arrows but fletchings have fallen off on multiple arrows. since we're new to archery I don't know it this is normal or not.
1,Too Many Typos,"I purchased this book off Amazon and started using it prior to the SAT's. The tips seemed good, perhaps a little basic. However, the only major problem was that many of the questions did not correspond correctly with the answers. Questions I knew I answered correctly were shown differently in the answer section. This was particularly evident in the last practice quiz section 4. The problem stated to solve was not the same problem the answer section explained (the answers obviously did not correspond either). A student studying for a stressful test such as the SAT, does not need the added typographical errors that filled this book."
5,The Best Bball Game on GC As of Now,"NBA 2k2 beats out every other bball game on the market. Though it has minor flaws, like every game, overall it's just great. Everything is done pretty well, except the street mode.I think this is the only thing Sega has to change for 2k2. The street mode isn't that great; it's basically a regular game with less people. The courts aren't done perfectly, and in Rucker the stands are empty.I don't really need the street mode though. The franchise, create-a-player, and just plaing gameplay buys this game for me. And if u like good gameplay, franchise, and other features u should buy this game.This game really deserves a 4.5 but u can't put that in, so I rounded it up to 5."
4,"A great game,but a few weak points!!","This game is great!!! The replays are awesome but there are a few weak points. One of them is that the street part is very weak and I would strongley suggest getting NBA Street. Another thing is that it is really easy to foul, go out of bounds,etc. Other than that it's a great game and I would get it!!!!!!!!"
4,The Importance of Meaning in Architecture,"This book was one of several books I studied to better understand the role of place in architecture and interior design. It helped me understand the importance of working with clients to understand the meanings they infer from the environment around them. In the book, Tuan highlights the importance of meaning and an insider's view. He describes place as humanized space. The contrast of open space with enclosed, comforting areas enhances both. As a person's emotional bond to a space increases, so do familiarity, comfort, and the sense of insideness. Without personal control over space, this emotional bond is slow to develop. To create place, Tuan suggests that memorable architecture should strenghen our memories, enhance the self, and provide layers of meaning to a space."
4,Kindle Edition Review,"This is an important book. If you're here, then you probably know why. However, my review will focus on the kindle edition format, not the content itself. It is for this reason I gave it four stars. I have an old black n white kindle, which handles the text fine. However, there are more than a few spelling errors. Words like, ""Value"" become ""Vaiue,"" and so on. I suspect it was converted using software and the publisher never bothered to proofread it. I want an update, free of course, because the errors are annoying."
5,Excellent read,"Malachite is a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining read. It is essentially a tale of two parallel journeys: the author's external journey through Africa on the forever faithful Bedford truck and the author's internal journey which examines his values, attitudes and, perhaps most importantly, fortitude. For a debut novel, Malachite is very well written and I look forward to reading his next book."
4,A compulsory read for any adventerous traveller,"The author shares his most intimate thoughts and fears he experiences over a seven month overland journey from Cape Town to Algeria with four (and sometimes six) others. The way the relationships develop and unfold between these young, daring travellers is acutely observed and described. The harsh conditions and the unforgiving roads north of Zimbabwe batter their otherwise loyal Bedford truck and their otherwise hardy friendships. The author's rather introspective account of his physical and mental suffering in the last half of the trip may just take the edge off for some. When they arrive in London, where he discovers the real cause of his suffering, it becomes evident that his own journey is truely a personal triumph. I was inspired."
4,small but unique shapes,"I could use a coin purse. Most of these boxes are the right size to fit in some of my pockets, but the posterboard is unlikely to wear well and coins might be falling on the floor as soon as I pulled some of these boxes out of my pocket. They might be noticed hanging on strings from the ceiling of a small room, but really, just wanting to play with these boxes is about all they can do."
5,Do you want to get scared?,"I gave this book five stars because it's kind of scary,and you have to find out something.It's about a kid going to summer camp and impersonates a friend.Then the spooky things begin.Read this book and find out the spooky thing!Don't get too scared!"
1,terrible product,"Sweet, diluted and ineffective. Besides, the bottle arrived half-empty. Needless to say, I was not impressed and will never buy again from this company."
3,Playability issues,"Big voltes v fan as a little kid, parents could never afford it for me. So as a man almost in his forties, why not regress to my youth a bit. Although piece is awesome in transformation, for the money, they could of made the displayability of the piece more sturdy. Piece a bit weak on certain stance, especially on sword grip with hands. The volt in version seems better when it comes to stiffness in play; better cosmetics as well. Check out YouTube reviews and it will confirm what I'm saying. The volt in version seems a bit more, but worth it; cheaper in eBay."
3,defective,volt lander left leg defective. Please advice i need to contact seller or worst if nothing is need i will return the product
4,Very pretty,"The bracelet came with a certificate and was in a velvet gift box. Very light, and the butterfly charm has diamonds in it. An affordable gift for someone who loves butterflies."
4,Very pretty,The bracelet looks just like the picture. We added some personal charms and are pleased with it.
5,KEEP SAKE,"WHEN I SEEN THIS CHARM BRACELET I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS....SO I PURCHASED IT, GOT HERE FAST, OPEN THE BOX AND TO MY AMAZEMENT IT WAS IT, WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND REALLY WANTED TO OWN ONE, NOT THE CHARM, NOT THE BRAND, BUT THE BRACELET ITSELF, IT IS A WELL MADE DOUBLE 14KT GOLD BEACELET, WHEN I LOOK AT IT I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS NEATLY MADE, CLEAN AND CRISP LINES, PERFECT LOOPS AND JUST OVER ALL A CLEAN MADE BRACELET, WHAT I MEAN AS TO CLEAN AND NEAT IS YOU DONT SEE ALL THE GOLD WITH PITS AND HOLES IN IT, NO SHARP EDGES AND DEFFENTLY NOTHING FALLING APART LIKE MOST DRACELETS THAT SELL FOR A FEW BUCKS, THIS IS A WELL DESIGNED ITEM AND I CAN SAY I AM PROUD TO OWN IT"
5,Very cute scarf,This scarf is very cute and was an excellent price. It is a fun accent for holidays such as Flag Day.
1,Disappointing,I have the Water Dog DVD and Book and purchased the Game Dog DVD and book. The book for both is outstanding. The Game DOG and Water DVD is the same video on DVD. Do not waste your dollars and purchase both DVD's. It is a waste of good money. Purchase Game Dog only. I have not seen Gun Dog but wanted something more with Upland dog training. Maybe Gun dog is the trick.
3,Dog Training,Bought this as a gift for a son of a friend to train his new dog. Not sure if it worked or not.
3,Good complement to the book,"Could be more in depth, but helps with visualizing some retriever training techniques and getting your timing correct on some of the drills."
5,This is a fine CD and an essential holiday recording,"I usually can't wait for late November to roll around so I can pull this jewel off my shelf. Of course, hearing the first sounds of ""O Tannenbaum"" evoke all of the childhood joys, anxieties and memories of Christmas. But as an adult, I appreciate the exquisite musicianship and emotions that coarse through this album. The depth of Guaraldi's treatments of such classics such as ""The Little Drummer Boy"" and ""The Christmas Song"" is stunning, and some songs, such as ""Christmastime is Here"" (instrumental) and ""Greensleeves"" are at times heartbreaking. Guaraldi's set captures the reverence of the holiday and the essence of jazz perfectly.This CD contains some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard, anywhere. Do yourself a favor: add this to your collection and play it often. November is just around the corner."
5,In the mood,"This a superb collection of intelligent, melodic, accessible jazz piano music by the brilliant Guaraldi. It is one of my favorite holiday albums; its ringing tones conjure up the proper holiday mood, while its clever variations on familiar melodies make them sound fresh and warm."
5,Childhood On A Cd,This CD encompasses my childhood in its tracks and I remember looking forward to the special being on television every year. The music makes me think of Linus and how I always enjoyed his Piano playing.I now have th CD to put on during the Christmas season and enjoy the music. This one gets played often during that time of year.
5,Great!,"My son wanted this CD to learn the songs to play for his son on the guitar. They loved it! Great find! It shipped right away, service was great!"
5,My favorite Christmas album!,This has always been one of my favorite Christmas albums and now that it has been digitally remastered it sounds even better!
3,Sounds New to Me,"My first thought:ARGH! Too late. I saw the ""Remastered Edition"" label only after I had purchased the album. My bad. At first I thought the songs had been changed.My second thought:After conmparing the 2006 album and the new edition: It's the sound that seems new to me. The songs themselves seem to remain unchanged. However, there's something sterile to them on the new ""remastered"" album. Is it me getting older and less open to change? :-)"
4,A good rendition of a great classic,"This album was purchased as MP3 and downloaded. The audio quality at 320Kbps stream rate is acceptable, but not quite up to the level of the original CD pressing, which I also own.However, I was very pleased with the additional tracks, which mostly made up for the somewhat sub-standard audio quality.Also, kudos to the Amazon staff for making my purchase experience a good one."
5,My favorite holiday music!,"Christmas season starts the minute I begin playing this music. I have this on at work, in the kitchen and in the car from Thanksgiving through New Years, and I never get tired of it!"
5,Classic Holiday Music,"This album brings back memories of the Christmas special. the music is wonderful, perfect for listening to in the car or while wrpaping gifts or sipping hot chocolate. The music is upbeat yet soothing at the same time. I listen to this constantly during the holidays."
5,Thank you baby Jesus for MP3s,"I've owned at least 3 copies of this cd and every single year, I manage to lose every one. I purchased this with the Amazon MP3 android app and now its on my phone, never to be lost again."
5,Required Holiday Listening,Just listening to the cd takes me back to my childhood. A must have for any Peanuts fan. My husband is even humming along now.
3,Good Holiday Background Music,"It is a classic that doesn't get old, and who doesn't like Charlie Brown. Enjoy this over the Holiday Season"
5,Best Christmas CD you'll ever buy..,"I absolutely love this CD and so do my kids (great way to get them listening to cool jazz -- and this is the coolest!).We keep it going all year long. This is a must-have purchase if you celebrate Christmas, like jazz or ever watched Charlie Brown as a kid."
3,Not as I expected.,I didn't realize the CD would be so long. It wasn't as I expected. I loved the show but the CD isn't all that great.
5,"Best Christmas album, ever.","This is not only the perfect musical accompaniment for the holidays (i.e. day after Thanksgiving through New Year's Day), it's a fabulous jazz piano album that you can listen throughout the year. One of my all time favorite recordings, period."
5,One of the best jazz albums of all time.,"I put this up there with 'Kind of Blue' and 'A Love Supreme' in terms of importance, especially to mainstream America.Let's be honest, this is the first place you really listened to a jazz song as a child. Just like Bugs Bunny is the first place you really listened to classical music.Vince's playing is wonderful. His sense of time and choice of notes are superb.What else is there to say...a must have for any jazz collector, I don't care what you celebrate in December. I listen to it all the time, it is great jazz music and should be enjoyed whenever you need a pick me up."
5,A Must Have Album,"I have always loved the Peanuts Christmas Special and I am relatively new to this album. But over the past 2 or 3 years it has quickly become one of my most played Christmas CDs. It's quite melancholy, but it sets a terrific mood. Highly recommended if you like jazz and the Peanuts special."
5,The only Christmas CD I like!,I'm not a big fan of Christmas music but this CD I LOVE! It's mostly instrumental and is very soothing. It's the only Christmas music I listed to at the holidays.
4,Christmas Time is Here!,"Most people enjoy a wistful little look back at their childhood Christmas mornings every once in a while. Vince Guaraldi does the trick nicely. His beguiling, smart structures opened up the wide wide world of jazz to many people in 1965 when he scored the Peanut's Christmas special. He also managed to do it with a vision that induced a certain magnetism to both his work and the work of Charles Schultz, the creator of the Peanuts comic strip. Listening to Charlie Brown's Christmas today, one is immediately transported back to that time in your life when that one night of the year that no matter how hard you tried to will it to...just wouldn't turn into morning quickly enough. After all, Christmas just isn't Christmas without `Linus and Lucy'."
5,Linda's review,This is a CD I have always wanted and desired the soundtrack from day one as a young child. I totally love it and every track on it. Glad to have the original CD as part of my collection. I am very satisfied and pleased with this purchase. Love it and it is definitely a 5 star purchase and a Keeper...great CD. Great sound.
3,"Great music, just ok quality",I was thinking since the album had been remastered that the quality would have gone up. Unfortunately there was a very pronounced hiss through out the entire album. I guess you can only do so much with the original recordings. But overall I did enjoy listening to these classics which brought back a lot of great memories.
5,Great memories,I have watched A Charlie Brown Christmas too many times to ount...with my children and now my grandchildren. The music is a fundamental part of what I love about the show and this CD does a great job keeping the memories alive.
5,LOVE IT,"Not only does it bring back memories of watching this movie every Christmas season growing up, it's also a great Christmas jazz collection in it's own right."
4,An American Classic,"Jazz has always been considered the peoples music.The absence of lyrics makes it easy to understand in any language and that is why this soundtrack works so well.Happy or sad,this music will indeed provoke some sort of reaction from just about anyone and from a child I have always loved this disc and the feelings it stirs up in me...both happy and sad.The songs resonate and really bring the Peanut characters to life transending any sence of time or place.Musically,its just some great jazz interpetations of well-known holiday favorites that are as good as any other Christmas collection.Great for you or someone near and dear - highly recommended."
5,This is the classic,"There was always something beat and hip about ""Peanuts"", and the Guaraldi themes got that when they became inextricably linked with Schultz's characters. I always thought too that this Christmas music brought out the slighty-blue edge I feel around the holidays, when the days are short and foggy. This is a jazz must-have."
1,Stick with the OLD version of this classic!!!!,"Such a shame that this classic has been destroyed! Very disappointed in this ""remastered"" version. This does not sound at all like the previos version I have from the 80s. What once sounded warm and natural now sounds cold and lifeless! Do yourself a favor and don't buy this version!"
1,Don't buy it if you have a previous issue,"What can one say? It simply doesn't sound as good as it's predecessor. If you are a real fan get yourself an older copy. The newly added songs from the great pumpkin and thanksgiving certainly aren't worth a new CD either. Trust me, you can do without this new CD, get yourself an older copy if you don't already have one."
1,"This should be labeled the ""remixed"" version",Purchase the previous released original soundtrack version - which is the actual music from the special. This version literally changes the music (The other reviews accurately provide the details)
5,Good Grief! It's a Charlie Brown Christmas--Expanded,"I give it 5 stars because there was not a choice for 50 stars!Vince Guaraldi is a genius. I have listened to Charlie Brown music by Vince since the 1960's and never get tired of it.Now, a collection of Christmas Songs is great for the holidays. Thank you so much for thinking about all of the Charlie Brown fans still out here!"
5,Best Christmas Music,"As a child of the 70's, this music is Christmas. This music always takes me back to those times as a kid. I am know introducing it to my children. Merry Xmas"
5,Best Christmas Album,The tracks take you back to your childhood and puts you into the Christmas spirit quickly! Classic album that needs to be in your Christmas line up.
5,A Charlie Brown Christmas SuperDisc,"A Charlie Brown Christmas CD is a must-have for your holiday music listening! The selections are charming, and make the perfect ""in the mood"" music for decorating your tree, wrapping your gifts, or for playing in the background for happy, holiday family and friend gatherings! I thoroughly enjoy all of the selections in this wonderful holiday CD!!"
5,A Classic Season After Season,"This is a album everybody should own.Vince Guaraldi is a genius when it comes to jazz,and his ensamble.Having his music put to the animated holiday classic was the ultimate.It fits perfect to the scenes.I just get goosebumps and a warm feeling everytime i hear ""Christmas Time Is Here Again"".The piano playing is just beautiful.It may be a short album,but so is the cartoon.I love that they put the ""Linus and Lucy"" theme here too.So check it out.Peace On Earth!"
5,The Classic Christmas Album,"Our musician son recommended it, and now we're considering sending it as a holiday gift to all our family members."
3,Wanted more Christmas music,"Cd is nice to listen to, but some parts I found boring. Would have liked more Christmas songs and more music with singing. I loved the songs Drummer Boy and Hark the Harold."
5,A sublime classic!,"About 10 or 12 years ago, I bought this CD for a Christmas gift swap, and had hoped to end up with it by the end of the night. Alas, I walked away with a set of holiday kitchen towels. Nice...but not the Vince Guaraldi Trio. So when I saw this on the website, I HAD to buy it! And when I heard the first chords....well, I just lit up and had a big smile on my face!! Love, love, LOVE this album and the music and the TV special and the Peanuts gang and Linus' solo and Charlie Brown's little Christmas tree and Snoopy's award-winning dog house decorations....BUY THIS ALBUM, for yourself, for your favorite sibling, for your little ones...anyone who from age 6 to 66 who LOVES Christmas!!"
5,One of the all-time best,"Who can hear ""Linus and Lucy"" and not think of pumpkin carving or Christmas pageants and decorated dog houses? The music herein is some of the best for the holidays, be them classics that predate the special or those created especially for it by the enormously talented Vince Guaraldi.""Christmas Time is Here,"" a classic now in its own right, got its start here, and it's a highlight of the album.Highly recommened for Peanuts fans, Christmas music enthusiasts, or anyone who just likes good music."
5,"Now, this is Christmas!",Charlie Brown and Vince Guaraldi Trio know how to get you in the Christmas spirit. So glad I got this!
5,A Classic,"This is an absolute classic. The musicianship of this trio is amazing, and of course the Charlie Brown Christmas never gets old!"
5,The Best,"It's the best Christmas jazz ever made, great singing. Makes you happy and nostalgic at the same time, because it's timeless."
3,A little misleading,The versions used for this CD are not the originals as stated by the other reviews.If I had known this I would not have purchased it.
5,Great for anyone who loves a Charlie Brown Christmas!,"This album is great for anyone who loves the Charlie Brown Christmas. There are 14 tracks total, which are all very delightful to hear for anyone who is a Charlie Brown fan.Great CD, must get if you enjoy any of the Charlie Brown Christmas music collection. Also great gift for all ages."
3,"I should have looked at the ""Mastered""","There are some things in life you don't mess around with, and A charlie brown Christmas is one of them. I've already deleted the extra tracks, don't care one bit for the extra stuff---They are good songs and such, but what's next ""A Charlie Brown and Whitney Houston Christmas?"""
4,Good Grief! New CD is better than old,"This new release is better than the old for the following reason: it sounds so much better! The remastering has brought more into the listening arena - hits on the cymbols sound clearer, the bass line is crisp and not muddled, the hiss is reduced, and lost artifacts are restored at the beginning or end of songs.After a few listenings, IF you have a disserning ear, you will love this remastered version of a favorite holiday CD."
1,No Noticable Differrence between SACD and CD,"Love, the album. But the SACD transfer does little to enhance the already superb audio recording on the regular CD."
4,great expectations,Great movie right up to the final minute -- all the plot elements pointed to a positive outcome -- what led the script writer to choose that sorry ending is anyone's guess -- I don't like my emotions to be toyed with and have enough on my plate already. I watched this on Netflix and won't be buying the DVD.
4,Stays with you,"Sad and wonderful movie. Shows that behind a complicated situation, to say the least, there are only human beings trying to live their lives."
5,So Sad,This wonderful film makes my heart so sad both for those who are under bondage to their hatred of others & those who are their victims.
4,Top Dog II,"This video is advertised to assist you in finishing a water dog into a top field dog using an electronic collar. The dogs used in the video were indeed impressively trained. The trainer demonstrates a number of good drills for the dog to polish his field skills, both in the water and on land. The collar use was very strategic. I learned a lot from this video on training possibilities, but mainly I was impressed with the potential of the dogs. I would have liked to have seen more collar technique, as this is an important training tool, however the serious trainer will benefit from this video training aid."
2,ok,Package the figure comes in is really mangled. I probably wouldn't have purchased this had I known it was in this condition.
4,Great nostalgia product; not compatible with 64bit,"I love this game! I had it when I was a child and its my favorite out of the all of the Oregon Trails. I feel like it gives the player the most control over the wagon party.My only issue is that it isn't compatible with the 64bit Windows. Luckily I was about to reinstall Windows when I discovered this, otherwise I would be pretty annoyed it doesn't state this fact in the product description."
1,Not compatible with new Macs,"This product says it works with Mac operating systems but fails to mention that Mac OS stopped supporting these older games when it released 10.5 Leopard. This will basically not work with any Mac that was purchased after October 2007. Also a minor annoyance, the case for the game came cracked and nearly broken."
3,Not as plush as I'd hoped.,The blanket itself was beautiful in color and style but I wish it was just a bit more fluffly and soft. Too lightweight.
1,NON IMPRESSIVE CINCINNATI REDS BOOK,I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK. THIS LOOKS LIKE A CHILDRENS LITTLE GOLDEN BOOK. THIS BOOK IS VERY SMALL AND VERY FEW PAGES FOR the price. I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE MORE PICTURES AND HISTORY OF GREAT PLAYERS THE REDS HAVE HAD. THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR A TRUE REDS FAN. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.
5,Some smokin' jams,"Hey, I can't believe there aren't any other reviews out there about this CD. Looks like Merl broke out a magical night from the old vaults. It's got some smokin jams out of Jerry, Merl, and Grisman. Track #3 will throw ya back in a groove. What kills me is they recorded most of the takes live at 3 in the morn. Guess they all had a lil' muse and candy action on that night.Anyhow, you'd be a sucka to let this pick go by. It's a ""keeper"" for real."
5,michael bloomfield,this a really cool cd.plenty of killer music.mike bloomfield lays down a great wah-wah solo on iron horse.
1,Just awful,"This is the worst purchase I've ever made, complete waste of money.Despite what the description says, this is not Mac compatible. It's barely PC compatable.The game itself is extremely difficult to figure out and nearly impossible to navigate. As an example, to leave any of the rooms you have to search for an exit that is unmarked. The exits are hidden in the rooms and you have to keep clicking on things until you get lucky and find it. Or you can get real lucky and the game can freeze and lock up your computer.The game itself has no real educational value, you just wander around clicking on things.I never bothered giving this to my 3 year old to see, it would have confused and frustrated her- even more than it did me.(I am very computer literate, just so you know this is not the complaint of someone inexperienced)"
5,Living Up To Its Title,"This book has become somewhat of a cult classic around the New York City neighborhoods. After a friend of mine lent it to me for a recent beach excursion, by the way he too is a graduate of this prestigious school, I soon realized the magnitude of this book. It was so enjoyable, on both a historical and humorous front, that I only wished I could have been part of this experience myself. I am glad the author allowed me to share in his experiences. George Brennan, Jr. is one of the most refreshing, unique and original authors I have read from in many years. He has an incredible gift for incorporating precise detail and alerting you to characters you will need to appreciate before they pass you by. Don't let this book pass you by. It is a sure fire winner."
3,Sobering.,"This is the Civil War diary of Major George Ward Nichols, aide-de-camp to General William T. Sherman during the latter part of the war. It is a personal story, describing his experiences during Sherman's March to the Sea and the subsequent march through the Carolinas.For a personal journal it is surprisingly well written and describes this journey as a decidedly uncertain endeavor. Written in the vernacular of the time, it provides a unique insight into the operations and risks associated with the most singular military event of the war."
5,Hope for hurting times,This book is my second bible so to speak. I have read it at least 5 times. It gives me hope when I feel so worthless at times. It reasures me that I am free from sins grip even thought I don't usually feel that way. The most important point I got from this book is that God is always there to help me in the fight to do his will and that I need to trust in him and not in my own strength to overcome any temptation that I may encounter. Its a great uplifting book that will get you though many a trial along with your Bible of course.
4,Mind Yoga is great for the mind and body...Not perfect but still I am impressed!!,"I used Mr. Hoyt's Lightspeed reading program with great results so I gave this program a test drive. It handles well, the only strike against it is that the schedule he provides seems a bit intense...I am a full time medical student so it is hard to adhere to a morning and evening schedule...I alternate and have felt good results...my blood pressure is lower, my resting pulse rate is lower and I am sleeping deeper. Overall it has helped not only my mental status but my body state as well. Not perfect but I still highly recommend it. I have shared this with my colleagues/fellow students and they are previewing it as a possible tool for the use with patients. Good work Mr. Hoyt, the schedule could be less strict...I know you shared that it is just a guideline. This is my only real critique of this ""Mind stretching system"". My patients will be the judge on a broader scale."
3,Way over priced!,"As a Paratrooper for over 35 years and an Airborne historian, I found this book at best fair, with the same info and pictures of U.S. WWII Paratrooper gear as books selling for one third the price of $78. Best part of this book was the photos of the 82nd and 101st Pathfinder platoons before D-Day."
5,"Excellent, erotic postcards","There is nice range of postcards in this set, ranging from the overtly erotic and suggestive (e.g. Andy Warhol with a banana in his mouth) to the more innocent and mailable (e.g. line drawing portraits).I haven't tried mailing any of the erotic ones yet, so I'm not sure how the mailman will react, but overall, these are highly recommended."
1,Ordered weeks ago -- still have not arrived.,"What could I say bad about the Andy Warhol postcards? I'm sure they are wonderful, but I have not been able to get them delivered. The promised date was long ago. In all fairness, I did get an email saying the delivery had been delayed and that I had the option of cancelling my order. I have not cancelled, and weeks later I am still awaiting the arrival of these postcards. I bet they are awesome, but can't say with all certainty until I take a look for myself. Maybe I can update this post then."
2,Not the *real* The Creation book by Johnson,"I thought I was ordering ""The Creation"" book by James Weldon Johnson. While this book does use his creation poem, the difference in the title should have clued me to something amiss. The words are similar, but the artwork by James Ransome in the *real* book reflect the African American heritage of James Weldon Johnson. The photos in this book are good, but I don't sense Johnson's pride in his race coming through. ""The Creation"" poem is verse one of ""God's Trombones."" I have re-ordered both ""The Creation"" and ""God's Trombones"" for myself."
3,keep in mind....,"This book is NOT about Circadian Rhythm. It is a book of poetry by an ex-cop, ex-Army pilot. It's a good book, but one ought to know that the title (though it mentions 'poetry') and the descriptions are misleading."
4,Light but entertaining read,"This book was a quick and enjoyable read. In the interest of full disclosure, I like the detective book for light reading and this one filled the bill. Enjoyed the fact that Lewis Cole has a sidekick."
4,Great read,I was looking for a good well rounded aspect of T1's. This was great. I do Video bridging and incorporate telephony into our calls. Just a great basis and further knowledge base.
2,VERY basic... and poorly presented,"My husband is a fan of Richard Wolters (and ownsGun Dog, which he likes) so he suggested that I purchase this dvd to help with getting our kids involved in our dog's training. BIG mistake. Although the information is basically good (simple methods for teaching basic commands like sit and stay) -- it is painful to watch this outdated production. I forced myself to watch to the end, but learned nothing and instead felt cheated that I had just spent so much money on something that I would now be tossing in the trash. My husband suggested I try to sell it, but honestly I don't feel right hoisting this on another unsuspecting dog owner. If you are completely clueless about how to train a puppy, have a high tolerance for cheese, and don't mind paying a premium price on a poor quality production, then go ahead and give it a try. For everyone else, pass."
4,How do I rate this product.,I looked at the DVD and it looked good to me. I haven't had a chance to try any of the advice since I am not getting my puppy in two weeks.
3,Family Dog,"It was somewhat odd how they teach thru this clueless family. It wastes considerable time. It did help with training, but could have been much better."
5,Impulse 3,"10 all the way for her however, constrictive on me and that took some of the fun away for me. She absolutely loves it! Thanks Andrea for the suggestions on getting this toy!"
5,Survival Guide,"My spouse lost his job about 19 months ago and we have had to start over again after 30 years of marriage and financial planning. You can believe your life is so secure one day and it can change drastically after this happens. This book has been very encouraging for me. Some days I feel like it was written just for me and my situation. It helps me to move forward and know that God is with me every step of the way. I now feel secure in God's love and care, not money."
4,"Inspirating, but suspiciously one-dimensional","I have read only a fragment from this book (though a relatively big one) and decided to stop. While there is a lot inspiring and edifying things about God's love to his children (which things, I hopefully believe, come in this case from the Lord Himself), I found no signs of sin-consciousness in the spirit which prevails there. While believing that the love of God should be the main concern in our life, I firmly hold that we shall never and in no way neglect His righteousness. The whole Bible is permeated with the idea that we are not only loved, but also grievously depraved beings. And without this fundamental truth about ourselves faith easily turns into false excitement, self-deception, and pinky-minded sectarianism."
5,Sesame Street,my 4 year old loved additon and subtraction he already know additon subtraction and multipcation he is working on divison so my 4 year old was playing this game for 5 hours he stopped when it was time for dinner after dinner he said Dad Can I Get Seasme street search & learn adventures and i said yes you can order a lot of seasme street cd roms your operating system is windows me and my child was so happy My name is kevin smithand my kids name is David Smith he love the song the song is called i want a monster to be my friend when i was a kid i heard that from a tv show called elmo palooza everyone love itTHE END.
2,Not as advertised,Just received my bags of yellow split peas. The bags are 14 oz. bags and NOT 16 oz. bags as advertised. I needed exactly 32 oz. for my soup recipe and now I am short. I am returning the item for a full credit. Will shop elsewhere.
2,NOT MICROWAVE SAFE or SAFE FOR MICROWAVE!,"They should have stated that it the item desciption...who doesn't microwave everything these days? I tired to anyway and sparks flew!!!!I had planned on tossing my old mixed stuff, but can't. THESE ARE ONLY NICE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE WOODS W/O A MICROWAVE or FOR THOSE WHO DON'T USE A MICROWAVE....WITH THESE YOU HAVE TO MICROWAVE IN ANOTHER CONTAINER TO PLACE ON THE PLATE OR IN THE BOWLS, I LIVE ALONE AND THAT'S A WASTE OF A CLEAN DISH! NOTHING IN THE SET IS MICROWAVE SAFE."
5,Inside jacket,"""Every glass manufacturing plant making container glass, flat glass, art glass, fiberglass, glass cookware, technical glass or any other type of glass product will find this book indispensable when an epidemic of defects arises. Downtime is money wasted. Defective ware is money wasted. This book can help you both to a minimum.Problems such as cord and stones are treated in a concise and forthright manner. The author recognizes the need to identify the defect quickly but also presents an avenue for pinpointing the source of each trouble so that corrective action can be taken.Over 150 full-color and black-and-white petrographic photographs serve as a guide for the class technologist in identifying the mineralogical form of the defect. The author then presents case histories for each illustration wherein he discusses the nature of the defect, the problem, the source and the corrective action which cleared up the problem""."
5,Trumpet stuff,"Good stuff, works fell on my trumpet. Valves work better than without oil. Would buy again if it is needed"
5,Blue Juice Valve Oil,I use a Selmer Trumpet made in Paris about 1958. It was made with a first valve trigger. Blue Juice Valve Oil is the best oil that I have found for this instrument.
5,Blue Juice,"This is very good valve oil. Not only does it lubricate your valves, but helps to keep them clean too. Just remember to lube your valves every day and they will stay like new, much longer.Jeff G"
5,Works just fine,"Not much to say about it, but a decent valve oil goes a long way, and Blue Juice is the best out there."
1,burns terribly and doesn't work....,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. I followed the directions and tried this product twice, about a month apart. Both times this product burned my skin to the point where it actually bled and scabbed over! On top of that, over half the hairs did not even come off, even though this product says ""for hard to remove facial hair"". I plan on getting my money back from Sally Hansen. If you have the least little bit of sensitive skin, then do not try this productno stars."
2,Be forewarned - you may get burned by this product,"I used this product, and, I admit it- I didn't do a test patch first to see if I would have a reaction. I ended up with an oozing burn on the side of my face next to my lips. It hurts when I open my mouth to eat. I am hoping that it won't scar and I have been putting antibiotic cream on it. It is rather unsightly. The crazy part of it all is that I don't have that much hair to get rid of in the first place. It may be that the product is very strong. It did work somewhat everywhere else I applied it, but because the product caused an adverse reaction, I would strongly recommend that you test it out 24 hours in advance as directed on the package. I give it two stars on the basis that I didn't follow the instructions exactly."
2,Create a Starship and then what...,"Starship Creator sounds like every Star Trek fan's dream: Build your ship, choose your ""dream"" crew and then fly it.Once you start to build your ship, you will soon see that there isn't much freedom to build a ship. You have a pre-set amount of parts to choose from and that is it.Then you get to choose your crew, which is fun, because you can choose from many of the established characters.But once you get to fly your ship, the programs looses all of it's since of awe. It is very boring from this point forward.Yes, this is yet another collectors item, but nothing more."
3,My thoughts,"The game is a little limiting, but the missions can be different depending on your starship. Just the other day I almost lost a starship to some parasites. And to all those that say the missions are very slow, there is a button that accelerates the mission time. I do, however, agree with other reviewers on this point. THIS GAME IS FOR TREKKIES ONLY. Anybody else will be bored in an hour or two. Also, those that say the game runs slow must be running it on a 486,100 MZH computer. And even on that speed computer it isn't that slow. However I recommend a Pentium 200 MZH or faster computer. Well, that's all."
2,Starship Creator: Review,"Starship Creator: Review by, JayI would say that this is a good game if you are intrested in the different classes and staffing ships. However, when I bought this, I was expecting to design my own ships, not choose a class, name it, staff it, and choose parts for it. The missions are horrible. They are time consuming and you have no power once they are started. The dialoge, which supposedly happens between different crewmembers, is the same each time, boring, and they would not really say those things. The graphics and sound are the best part of this game, as well as the background information on the crewmembers. There is no differece between the Intrpid class and Constitution class, except in capacity in equipment and etc. Don't waste your money, the games on startrek.com are cheaper, and better than this game right here."
1,Not even worth one star,"I, like the others here, thought that this game would be wonderful. The idea of designing, building, testing, and flying ones own Starfleet vessel was very intriguing; then, I played the 'game.' It was a complete waste of time, far too slow, and did not offer any exciting aspects that are present not only in the series' but in other ST games as well. This does not even come up to the level of a screen saver--a total waste of money."
1,Creater game,I really didn't like this game very mutch....it was borring and had very poor graphics...
2,FUN IF LIKE TO BUILD AND STAFF THINGS,THE BEST PART OF THE GAME IS BUILDING AND STAFFING THE SPACESHIPS YOU CAN BUILD. WHEN YOU THEN SEND YOUR SHIP OUT ON IT'S MISSION YOU JUST SIT BACK AND WAIT AND WAIT AND IT GET BORING BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LET THE PROGRAM RUN IT'S COURS -- THERE IS NO ROOM FOR IMPROVE.
2,Doesn't Quite Live Up to its Name,"The makers of Star Trek: Starship Creator came up with an intriguing idea. A great idea, really. Ingenius. However, after coming up with that idea, they handed it off to mediocre programmers. It would be much better on a superfast computer, i.e. a Pentium II 266 MHz. (My friend has one that I played this on.) It works fine on that, or at least it works how it was intended. The graphics suck, and there are no options (i.e. only seven classes of ship, and you can't change anything.) The missions are not interactive at all, and very time-consuming. And don't even try swapping ships with others. If it works at all, it will take forever, and it probably won't work at all. I can say two things on the plus side: 1) The music is really good, and 2) On a fast Pentium, the 3D rotating images are spectacular. Nevertheless, I found myself tossing the disc into the trash can after two weeks."
1,Screen savers are better.,The title of this review says it all. You go through a lot of clicks and set up to maximize your budget to build a new design of Starship. The missions when you test your vehicle are much more boring than most screen savers. Many warn this is not an action game but battle chess has more interesting items to please the viewer and much more hands on control.
1,What A Piece Of Junk!,Unfortunately I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. Starship Creator is very lacking and restrictive in its abilities. There is little flexibility. Hopefully the Star Trek franchise will come out with something much better soon. Let's keep our fingers crossed! Where is Q when you need him?
2,"It's O.K., If You Are a Star Trek Fan","This game can be satisfying for a Trek fan, but for an average computer game enthusiast, this game can put you to sleep. There are several complaints that are explained in the previous review that I completely agree with. I'm not saying that this game is horrible, but it is relatively limited. For Trek fans, this game may be appealing, but it's not a game that's going to draw you into a story line or something. it is more like a game you can full around with on your spar time, you won't be cough up in it for hours."
4,INFORMATIVE,"Very good information. A little on the dry side, but its not easy to add spice to a training video. Very good training tips."
4,Great resource,"This is a great resource. Being in nursing school this program makes it really convenient to look up information very quickly and easily. I don't have to lug around huge books and flip through hundreds of pages, the information is at my fingertips and is very helpful.I would definately recommend this product."
5,Perfect,Looks just like the picture and isn't made out of the really cheap material like you would find on most costumes. This one looks like it will last a while. I felt like it runs true to size. Many people said it ran small so I ordered a size up which is almost too big but nonetheless very sexy.
4,Good quality costume,This costume fits true to size and is of good quality. I would certainly buy another costume from this maker.
5,Cute costume!,"I'm a size 5, and an extra small barely fits. That said, this is an adorable costume! The styling is cute, the fabric is pretty good quality, and it came with a simple petticoat. I'm happy with it. :)"
1,Shipping Charge,I've tasted this coffee at a friend's house and it is fabulous. The $7.95 shipping fee that New Lines Sales charges for an $8.00 can of Lavazza in Blu is outrageous and ridiculous!
3,"I love Sylvester, but...","It's my fault! I should have read the song list on Sylvester's Original Hits CD, but I wanted 'You Make Me Feel Mighty Real,' so bad I added to cart immediately.To be honest, I've never heard most of the songs, plus, I'm not too crazy about them.Can't Stop Dancing should have been included.To top if off, sound quality is lacking.I have four new car speakers...other CD's sound great, but Sylvester's Orignal Hits comes across, dull, mono.I love Sylvester, but Original Hits isn't one of his best albums."
4,Dora valance,"I bought the valance to go with my daughter's bed set. It arrived very quickly and it was the matching material to her set. However, I would've liked to have seen more effort in the sewing. Maybe double stiched so that the thread doesnt come unraveled so easily. The slighest tug on the stitch and you end up with a piece of fabric. I would buy again, I just think people are looking for better quality when they spend their hard earned money these days."
2,"A lot of information, but not all correct","Dr. Stewart is not chemist, nor knows chemistry so well, therefore he made several errors in this book. Although he collected a lot of information, not all materials are well-reviewed nor verified. His explanation about the transformation of matricin(he calles it matricene) to chamazulen is incorrect, the classification of terpinen-4-ol as phenolic compound is invalid, let alone the false chemical formulas of chamazulen and terpinen-4-ol.His preaching reduces the professional quality of the book. What a pity ! A book is recommended for beginners and for professionals who has no ideas about chemistry. For those who have good background, it is a good book to pick up information and to verify it on one's own."
3,Beginner to Essential Oils - Way over my head!,"As a beginning user of essential oils trying to educate myself, this book was an overwhelming read for me (at nearly 850 pages). I would instead recommend Dr. Stewart's book as an excellent resource book for professionals who work with and educate others about essential oils. (e.g. Licenced Aromatherapists, Raindrop Facilitators, and Aromatherapy Instructors). It is much more of a textbook on the how & why of the Chemistry behind essential oils than which essential oil is good/bad for this or that and how best to use it.Even for professionals without scientific background, Dr. Steward's book is written in an approchable style, weaving seemingly dry material on the subject of Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, Chemotypes, Isoprenes, Terpenes, etc. in with Christian spiritual commentary and insightful stories.5 stars for professionals. 1 star for the beginner."
4,Chemistry of Essential Oils Made Simple,"I could not put this book down. Finished it in a couple of days. The first section gives even the uninitiated a good understanding of the molecules that work in the essential oils. The second section provides lots of charts, grouping, naming, describing the oils, their constituents and how they are used. The final section is worth working through the first two sections for. Dr. Stewart goes beyond basic chemistry to the ideas of quantum physics and spiritual understanding of what lies behind the mechanics of the molecules. He also gives references and reviews of several other books and studies of other scientists and researchers. This is an excellent book for anyone who loves essential oils and is interested in learning about how God designed them to work!"
2,Not what I was expecting....too technical for me. I wanted something a bit more down to earth. I am sure others love it though,"....too technical for me. I wanted something a bit more down to earth. I am sure others love it though, I personally did not like it"
5,Great book,"For those that prefer alternative medicine, this is an in-depth look at essential oils. Detailed and informative, this is the perfect companion for using oils."
4,Chemistry of Essential Oils,"This is an awesome educational book. Gives perspectives on YL and on many other sources in the field of E.O.'s as well as educates you on Essential Oils. Be prepared it is very educational, meaning it can get a little snoozish. But it is a Chemistry book which anyone and everyone can understand. If you aren't that interested in all the bits and pieces of this science and field maybe not the book for you. I however love it, even if I have to have coffee while reading some portions :) A great educational tool for anyone working in the field, going into the field, or wanting to educate themselves for their own personal health reasons. It is a awesome find. I was so happy to receive it for the Amazon price!"
3,Jamison,"The White Hominy Corn does not seem fresh.Long time to get it tender. The bags are inferior, in that,two of them were broken open and two more had holes in them. We do not wish to order from this outfit again."
5,Realistic POV Telling Of A Tragic Baseball Story,"Mike Sowell is a unique baseball writer. He writes on the sport based not solely on the sport itself, but on the historical context in which the events he is documenting take place. Thus, with ""The Pitch That Killed"", the reader discovers the perspective that each of the principles have in the tragedy, from Carl Mays to the mayor of Cleveland in 1920. In addition, the Communist scare, the Harding administration, and the carefree lifestyle of that era are all examined as to how they apply to the primary topic. Certainly other baseball writers have tried this, but Sowell makes it readable and avoids the trap most writers fall into. In other words, Sowell makes it relevant without reverting and tainting his subject matter with personal nostalgia. And that is why this book is such a great read."
1,Terrible,All you have to do is look at the image to realize you'll get no salt out of this. The two holes will clog and nothing will come out. I bought this since it was cheap and was later forced to buy a working salt shaker.
5,Excellent Album,This album is very inspirational. I think everyone should own it. Each song I can identify with and I know the Lord is with me when I'm listening to these songs. It's a great album to listen to in your car when you're driving to work. I need it in the mornings to keep me going. I think Ed Evans is a great artist.
5,BEAUTIFUL BLONDIE but......,If this is the singles box where is ONE WAY OR ANOTHER or THE HARDEST PART ??? Love these boxes but there is no excuse for that........these box sets are delicious but the exclusion of 2 charted singles is sort of stupid. Great buy got this for 19.99 so I am happy about that! Look for sellers!!!
4,WISH MORE GROUPS HAD THEIR SINGLES AND REMIXES IN ONE PACKAGE,THIS IS ALL THE SINGLES IN ONE PACKAGE AT A REASONABLE PRICE TOO BAD THEY DIDN'T PUT THEM ON FEWER DISCS TO SAVE SPACE
2,Affirmations not divination,"I love Sylvia Browne and all of her books, she shows humor, kindness and sense of advanture that make her a 'different' kind of psychic. I purchased the cards thinking it was more like a tarot deck - but it's really a deck of 50 various affirmations that help you to get through grief, betrayal, life and disappointment as well as love etc. The illustrations are beautiful and the affirmations are right on the money - but again, they seem to be presented as a divination tool instead of cards for affirmations. Still love ya Sylvia!"
5,A Tour de Force,"Alan Jacobs apparently has read and thought about pretty much every book pertaining to his vast subject and a few more besides. This extended essay (if I may call it that) offers the weary reader bracing refreshment from the grim sourness of a hermeneutic of suspicion. It calls us instead to a non-sentimental but clear-eyed and hopeful attitude by which to read, an attitude Jacobs himself exemplifies on every page, whether he's dealing with Nietzsche or Nussbaum, Descartes or Derrida."
5,As Expected,"The CD is exactly as I expected. I had listened to some tunes from one like it that a friend has. Service, shipping, etc, was fine."
5,Linus and Lucy is a a lovely Jazz tune!,"Linus and Lucy is so lovely!It has a Jazzy mix,and is one of the lovliest songs in jazz history!Now ya can own the Number 1 song on the Billboard list between 1964 and 1989 on the Soundtrack!Know that theme song that goes Nah nah nah nah nah nah/ nah nah nah nah nah nah/ nah nah nah nah nah nah/ nah nah nah nah nah nah/ Do Do Do Do Do Do Do Do/Do Do Do Do(flute)Now you can relize the animated blockhead in this soundtrack!So go out and buy this thing before it goes outta print!"
5,You already know it by heart,"You never knew the name of that one song; you just watched the specials. It's called ""Linus and Lucy"", it's probably running through your head right this minute, and it's on this CD. And after one listen, you'll realize that everything else Guaraldi wrote for the Charlie Brown shows is equally brilliant. Indispensable."
4,Charming and cozy,"The picture on the CD says it all. How can you not love it? If you've always loved the soundtrack to the Charlie Brown shows, this CD will be a treasure! SACD is just the icing on the cake!"
3,snitch,yeaaaaaa g unit is just a bunch of fake snitches. 50 got shot and stabbed and didnt do a thing about it. all he did was get a restraining order. ITS MURDA! GGGGUNOT
4,Pump,"Nice pump for the money, quick ship. Seems bigger in the picture, but will do the job at the gpm value."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money- didn't last one day pumping water on a slow scale. Tried using it with my pool, not enough power to pump water out of the pool and onto the gravel- after about 30 minutes, the propeller stopped pumping what little water did go through the garden hose. Something tells me it's ""Made in China""- explains the price and the fact it stopped working."
1,An interesting crackpot conspiracy theory,"This seems at first like a solid, academic, study. There's some interesting material on corruption in Mexico and Columbia, and on government use of drugs dating back to the Opium Wars. But by the time you get to chapter 10, on ""Cultural Underpinnings of Modern Drug Consumption,"" it's hard not to realize that in fact the book puts forward a ... conspiracy theory: Freemasons, George Soros, Paul Allen, Satanic rock musicians, Playboy magazine, Aldous Huxley, George Soros again... -- they've all supposedly been involved in a vast conspiracy to promote drug use to undermine the state. ..."
5,Hidden Jewel,"Jerry and Merl at at there best playing live.This is a overlooked hidden jewel recorded in 1973 with John Kahn, Tom Fogerty and Ron Tutt.. Any fan of Jerry Garcia/Deadhead or blues afficianado will love this album. Their rendition of ""Lonely Avenue"" is the best since Ray Charles. ""After Midnight"" and ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" are classics. This is as close to a money back guarantee rating as you can get for those who like blues/funk."
3,not as good as other Fantasy recordings,"This is combination of 2 of Merls albums from early 70's on Fantasy. While there are some good cuts--there are also some cheesy compositions, which are not redeemed by jamming as live recordings might have been. Im not a big fan of Merls songwriting--though I love his playing. I therefore preer the covers on this album of all-stars. Its not at the level of other recordings of period, including Keepers by Merl. I was disappointed overall, thought it might be a gem---as it is I wont listen to it much."
2,Mostly Mediocre -- get the keystone performances instead,"A few of the tunes with Jerry leading and Merle filling with organ are as good, or nearly as good as the Saunders/Garcia material from the Live at the Keystone albums. The other material here is stuff that one does not wonder why it stayed in the can so long. The arrangements and the singing (even Jerry's) are less than stellar. From a host of recordings, there might be a few that stand out as high enough quality, exceptional enough to warrant release. This album is the stuff leftover, that was held back from release. One listen and you can tell why. It's not bad, it's just nohwere near what they are capable of doing.If you like Merle and Jerry (and Kahn and Vitt), and I certainly do, stick with the Live at the Keystone albums, Vol.s 1 and 2 and Encores."
4,Great all around depth finder/temperature sensor,"This is a great unit! The screen is huge, and is incredibly easy to read from all angles and in sunlight. Very easy to install and operate. I used a dash switch to power the unit on and off since there is no power on/off feature built into the unit. I have had no trouble so far in the month I have been using this unit on my 23' Mako with the transom mount transducer. I definitely would recommend buying this unit, and would buy again."
4,BEAUTIFUL FANTASY,"The idea of forbidden love is exciting.In this story Sira who is a faerie falls inlove and marries Conn a mortal against her father Boadach king of the faeries. This book is full of fantasy,love and sacrifice, wonderful read."
4,Good - Do not purchase water dog,"Purchase Game Dog and NOT Water Dog. They are the same video on DVD, with the addition of puppy selection. The books are different the DVD is NOT. Very disappointed, when I purchased both."
1,Where in the world is the REAL Carmen Santiego???,"this is awful!!!I had played the original game -- about fifteen years ago I think-- which was a very intelligent set of geography puzzles and hours of fun.This ""new version"" has taken a great concept and destroyed it by thinning the content to a point of triviality and replacing it with a mindless cartoon storyline that often goes into repeated inanities and makes no sense whatsoever.Where in the World is the REAL Carmen Santiego???"
4,very interesting,"Even as old as the game is now, and how long ago I bought it, I still have the urge to play it every now and then. It is addicting and educational at the same time. It isnt too easy nor too hard which is why my little brother adores it, loving the cartoon-like characters that he gets to direct. Technically, the game is good. I had no trouble installing it on several different machines, and there were hardly any problems playing it. It's definetly worth the money."
3,Okay but.....,"I was disappointed. We bought this because we first had Where in the USA is Carmen. Unlike that one, this one ends and there are no alternate missions..."
4,Carmen takes the cake,"The graphics aren't fancy, but the educational opportunities with this game are great. My 7 year old daughter loves this game- she likes to speak words in all different languages and she knows now where Crete is! I like the kinds of games that teach my kids while they are having fun and this one does just that. (I'm learning a few things as well!)"
1,Garbage,Not the original Broderbund version. The learning company sux. It isn't worth the dollar. These nice guys sent me 2 separate disc's(same day) so they could soak me for 2 shippings of 6 bucks each. Absolute garbage. Never deal with these guys again. Anyone know where to get the version I had 12 years ago. Broderbund's site no good...
2,Carmen,This game would have been better if it came with directions so you would at least know how to play it and not have to guess at everything. I finally figured it out though.
1,Not what I wanted at all,"I was really hoping to get the version of the game that I enjoyed when I was young. This has been labeled as the ""Classic"" version of the game.. but it is not that at all. It is no where near the original game. The version I know and love from middle school was challenging then and I'm sure I would still have a good time with it now. The game I received was LAME. The product description needs to explain that it is not the original game. I may have to give up looking for the game as I don't want to waste any more money on games that aren't what they appear to be. Very disappointed."
4,Good Game,"I am over the age to be playing this as it says on the box, but I still find it very interesting and play it when I'm bored and just feel like playing something. The fact that I beat the game before has kind of taken out the fun of not knowing what will happen next, but when I first bought it the game was challanging and exciting. I recomend it."
5,Just like when we were kids,"This game is educational and fun. We have a 6yr old boy who loves this. He is learning to put the case together to find Carmen. It, however, does not work on our Windows XP but does work on our MacBook."
1,Couldn't get it to work,"I've heard great things about this computer game so I got it for my children for Christmas. Unfortunately, I coudn't get it to load onto my computer (and I tried everything!). Oh well!"
3,More pop than R&B,"I have rated this a 3 only in comparson with Ruth's other albums. If I was comparing it to most music available it would probably get a 4.""Tears from Heaven"" the Eric Clapton tune is the absolute standout of this album. When Ruth, at 70, sings this song with all of the history she has seen, friends and family she has lost, you would have to be made of stone not to be introspective and think of your own life and loss.""I've got the world on a string"" is a fun rollicking song that she should have recorded long ago. She makes it her own.Most of the rest of the album is fine..but too pop to be Ruth.If you are buying your first Ruth Brown album...I would choose R&B = Ruth Brown...but if you like Ruth...you'll like the album."
4,Touches Deeply,"I was totally into the book when I read it. I really worship the relationship between Terri and her father, they've always been so tight and close. But one day when Terri discovers something is wrong, all these troubling thoughts blocks her mind. And when she finally found out the truth of the lie her dad had been hiding for 13 years- that her mother was still alive, she takes a trip to visit her, and she was planning to stay with her mother foever. Then she starts to worry about her dad, and in the end, she still stays with her dad, because she loves him. I cried at the ending"
5,Cake knife and server,It was beautiful for a bride who really loves china and crystal and entertaining. It will be a reminder of this happy time for years to come. She loved it and I was impressed with the quality.
3,Great for the beginner to intermediate,"This solo book is mainly for those that want to play a watered-down version of the Evans' playing you hear in recordings. For the average pianist this is a great book to sit down and chunk out a few jazz tunes with, but for anyone that's really serious and wants a REAL transcription, forget it. These arrangements are FAR from the real deal...go for the Bill Evans Trio artist transcriptions by Hal Leonard if you want note-for-note."
2,Tremendously Disappointing,"I've followed Andy LaVerne for decades. A heck of a player and an ultimate rarity: An Actual One-time Student of Bill Evans.So how can a guy with Andy's background and abilities do such an underwhelming service to the legacy of Bill Evans?This folio is extremely disappointing. No, it's not meant to be a series of Evans transcriptions, but I don't know WHAT it would be considered, or where it would fit in the overall spectrum of Evans folios. If LaVerne has a great inner understanding of Evans approach or stylings, these ""renditions"" surely don't indicate it. Yes, there are a lot of Evans folios available, mostly transcription-oriented, but there is at least one that has arrangements of Evans pieces that are much more indicative of his composing and playing ideas, in particular his signature, subtle inner-movement of harmonic voicings. But you don't get that here.I doubt that I'll ever have cause to open this folio again. But at least it'll stay in mint condition."
4,Bill Evans - 19 Arrangements for Solo Piano,"These arrangements are a good exposition, for those of us who haven't a clue, of how to use Eb7#9#5 and other such chords in a musical sentence. Voicing of jazz chords has been something of a mystery. There are ""aha!"" moments in each tune when I can finally hear that jazz sound coming from my piano, and at the same time I am playing, no less. The book is worth the price just to have an arrangement of the beautiful Peace Piece. Not especially easy arrangements for the late intermediate player, but a rewarding challenge."
1,Misleading Title- what a ripoff!,"""Bill Evans - 19 Arrangements for Solo Piano BY BILL EVANS""is how this book is being advertised on Amazon -at the least misleading, at most false advertising. The tunes are by Evans, but the notes here are Laverne's, not Bills.thanks goodness it was only 10 bucks."
1,An irritating heroine,"Alexa has no sense of the danger that she is getting herself and her husband into, with her constant questioning of his integrity and naive and untrained efforts to spy for the English. I finally couldn't take her anymore and dumped the book; give me a smarter heroine than this one every time! The sex is hot, but you probably already guessed that."
2,The book is a disapointed.,"I have all Ms. Martin books but I don't think I will keep this one. It wasn't about love. However, my sister think that it interesting. Still, I couldn't made myself finish 'till the last pages."
5,Devil's Prize,"Kat Martin's ""Devil's Prize"" closes this 3 book series of ""Gypsy Lord;Sweet Vengeance;Devil's Prize"", with a BANG...This lady isa fantastic writer. Devil's Prize begins with a thrilling love story of 2 people ;A spoilt rich girl,and a patriotic nobleman; who did not realize just how much they loved and depended on each other for survival....Fantastic read.."
1,Religious pontification,Are you a space geek? Don't buy this book. Are you hyper-religious? You'll love it.I wanted an insider's perspective on space travel. Not a sermon about how Jesus is the engineer of the space program and everything inbetween.
2,FRACTAL LECTURE,"I was disappointed. The lectures were a little dry. I thought the dvd had more videos of actual fractals, not just a lecture about them."
1,Worst Keyboard Ever!!!!,I purchased this keyboard for its multi-media functionality. I have to mention that the multi-media keys worked perfectly. Too bad none of the other keys worked. All of the keys stuck and made it almost impossible to use. It was immediately returned. Buyer beware. This keybord sucks!!!
4,A good game.,"This game is just like cross version. Despite popular rumors you don't actually build your robots. You customize them with different colors, body designs, and weapons. I have both of these 2 versions and I personally like Cross better. The atributes of the robopon are more complicated than Pokemon types. If you like RPGs and customize-your-team games this is for you!! I don't recommend this for young gamers, it has too many possabilities and is a little hard to understand."
1,"Fine product, but...","It should be noted that this product is now out-of-date. Microsoft provides a new development environment, called the Embedded Visual Tools (eVT) which supports the new PocketPC platform as well as older WinCE devices..."
5,Great photos and sales data,"A must for any Manhattan Condo buyer. Great building photography, accurate sales data and well organized. The first easy to use real estate resource for a consumers. I loved the maps and pocket size of book."
3,Not bad,"My daughter got this for her first birthday. She played with it for about 2 weeks, and then got bored with it, though every once in a while she would pull it out to play the sounds. The bird song is way too long and can get extremely annoying when it is played over and over again. Thankfully, you can cancel it out by playing one of the other shorter sounds during the birds song.Needless to say, we've put this away for a while. We'll probably pull it out again when she's older to see if she'll enjoy it more then."
3,More fun with Little People,"My son has always loved his Little People farm, he loves animals so when he saw this set at a friends house he was begging to go over and play with it all the time. We got 3 of them for Christmas, We returned 2 and have added the train and the house to our Little people world. Now at 4 1/2 my son is obsessed with collecting Little people. My 1 year son old can play along with him."
3,some fun at the zoo,i wasen't as pleased with this toy from fisher price.It has cute animals which are big and chunky good for small hands to hole.It does all of the animal sounds which Is good for learning but as for playing with this toy not much to do.If your Childs Is good at pretend than there all set
3,"Seems a little bit boring, I guess","William loves his Little People School Bus and the discovery city, but seems bored with the zoo. Dont know why - maybe the unfamiliarity with zoo animals."
3,annoying sounds,"My 16 month old daughter loves this toy, but the sound all the animals make are very annoying. Almost all of them sound like a human making the noises and it just irritates me to no end. The elephant is the only one that sounds real. The bird ""singing"" is a human whistling a song!"
4,good toy,My 16 month old loves fisher price little people. This toy is fun to a certain extent... The bird is loud and the song is too loud and annoying but you can press on a different animal to cancel it out. The other animals are great. My daughter doesn't get scared by the sounds. This actually taught her animal sounds. I only wish the monkey would detach - she gets so mad that she can't get it out to play with. It also jumps to quickly to enjoy.
4,Fun for even young children--,"My son, who is now 18 months, got this toy when he was about 5 months old. He has always like the sounds and the animals. Now he can really play with it and make the car go. He seems to like playing with the zoo as well as the car and animals. I would recommend this toy highly, even at a young age. It will last a long time."
3,"Cute toy, but not played with at all","This item was bought for my little guy when he was 1.5. He likes to push the buttons to make all the animals sing, but other than that, he could care less about it. I noticed that many of the other reviewers have daughters who love this toy. May I suggest that if you have a son, get something else. Although this toy is very, very cute and well made, it doesn't provide much educational value, nor does it hold the interest of boys very long. I think girls have more creative play qualities that these types of toys require, whereas boys prefer something with a little more action. This toy is now stuck in the back of a room and hasn't been played with for months."
4,Excavating Nazca Civilization,"This film documents the excavation of ancient Nazca structures in South America. Archeologists & other experts examine the remains of cities and/or ceremonial sites which have been covered over by sand for many centuries. They take a look at well preserved mummies, some with nails and hair intact. Experts discuss the elongated skulls of some of the skeletons (an elete beauty ritual?) and other skulls which have therapeutic holes bored into them. They also find some remarkably well preserved and colorful textiles. Theories on the famous Nazca Lines (which can only be fully appreciated from the air) are discussed and there is even a short interview with Erich Von Daniken (author of Chariots of the Gods). There is much speculation about the way these people lived and their beliefs. A very intriguing film about a less familiar ancient civilization."
5,Shocked and Inspired,"Shocked and Inspired December 31, 06Amazing, undeniable! Words can't express how shocked I am after reading this concise and simple book. This is the most compelling interpretation of biblical literature I have ever read in my life. Never in my wildest dreams could I ever imagine that Adam and eve were Not Naked. It is so simple to understand that your mind opens; just one word can change the whole Bible ""naked"" (unprotected) this makes so much sense.The church is really irresponsible for leading us astray; claiming Eve ate an apple when it was never written that she did. I always believed the story of Adam and Eve living in a garden was more like a parable.Christ as our second Adam is another remarkable thing this book reveals to us, just imagine being taken from the body of the Son of God, that's an awesome feeling! This book is inspiring and also riveting. It's a must read!"
4,nice gift item,Great gift item for friend or family. This something that will be used when they have company over for a visit.
5,The talent of the musicians on this CD is explosive.,"Every song on this CD tastes like a gourmet meal. The arrangements are superb.This album is a musicians dream, especially if you like to write jazz arrangements.The quality of the recording is the best I have heard; I play it to check the performance of my stereo system."
1,Save your box!,The one sent to me was damaged at the manufacturer or re-boxed. It came packaged very well double boxed with foam all around. With no damage to the outer box or inner box I took the outer box to be recycled and when I tore the inner box off I noticed one corner smashed in pretty good and the bottom drawer bent when I removed all the packaging I realized another corner bent and the whole thing looks as though it was dropped.Now having said all that the piece is very well made I own another part of this collection and love it. So for now I'm watching out for a great price on another 4-drawer dresser and I'll put the damaged one in my garage.
1,"POS - Cheap looking, cheap construction, drawers don't work.","Bought this to go with the bed. The bed is AWESOME. Heavy duty, sold, good... looks terrific. If you like the look, get it and don't look back. Three teenagers with weight issues could easily sleep on it and never cause problems.But this piece of crap is made of MDF with an ugly grain, weird size, and most importantly, the tracks for the drawers are the worst I've ever seen. I wouldn't pay $50 for this, let alone the $500 plus I paid for two.How they could be made by the same manufacturer as the quality bed is crazy."
4,"Good, bad and not so ugly","These painted aluminum anchors never really took off for KV, and that's really a shame. These shelf hangers are very attractive and allow the shelves to be mounted close together without loosing the space where ordinary brackets would block the shelf space below and they come in different colors. There are lots of ""hidden"" mounting holes, so there should be no problem lining up to something solid to mount them to. However they are made for a 5/8"" thick shelf, so you're stuck buying one of the ""hardware store"" shelves that are made of vinyl covered pressed board. The shelves can be dificult to install, but hang on thightly once they are. Also the plastic end caps have a tendancy to come loose and we ended up gluing ours in. If it weren't for these little quirky things, I'd have given them 5 stars."
4,Nice smooth sound throughout...,"I like the title track or ""Allie's theme"". Maurice Jarre is very talented. His special blend of electronics/keyboards adapt well to the eerie scope of the Mosquito Coast. Not many stand out tracks on this CD. Still, this is a movie soundtrack, not a solo project so it works for me. Let your mind coast to The Mosquito Coast."
4,A very good website authoring suite...,"Dreamweaver isn't an easy app to use, but the results are stellar...Icould've used MS Frontpage with all the wizards & made things easier andfaster, but I wanted it harder so I'd learn something...And, I have...Fireworks is good as a stand-alone, but better when used with Photoshop,for getting images ""good to go"" for your web page(s)..."
5,Paint Stirrer 2pcs,"They do exactly what they say just stir paint. They are nice and small for easy storage for wherever you store you tools. They are easy to clean and work great, not much else to say."
4,Compelling and Timely,"Religiously Transmitted Diseases is a compelling look at some of the doctrines, both spoken and unspoken, that threaten to distract believers from the purity of the gospel message. This is an important book, and not for the squeamish of faith."
1,More pseudo-evangelicalism,"The way Gungor goes on, any Christian who wants to live a life of separateness (Israel has always been called to separateness!) and holiness unto God is a pharisee with the spiritual equivalent of full blown AIDS. For Gungor, the real road to freedom is through flowery visions of God sending us on romantic vacations. This book is in the same category as that of Rick Warren, Bill Hybels and other emergent, antinomian male writers who think, act and write like women. And guess who these books appeal to? Thanks but no thanks. I'll stick with the Puritans."
1,Don't Buy,"Totally unreadable for beginners of acupuncture.Even for a practitioner, one may get reallyconfused. Translations of Chinese and Japanesewords are lost in essence. Attemp to compilea book according to the Japanese style of publishingacupuncture books does not do good service toAmerican readers."
4,Excellent,Excellent book from someone who has experienced brokenness firsthand. It is a book that I have purchased for several of my friends. I have read the book twice and intend to reread it about once a year.
5,A book that combines the spiritual truth with the genuine openness of the author,"This is an amazing book. My duaghter was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor this year, and I have been personally broken in ways that I never could imagine. This book has been the best I have read for understanding why God allows such difficult circumstances.Pastor Solomon's story of his daughter demonstrates more than just a theological understanding of what brokenness is, and how brokeness is used by God."
4,"Brokenness, just what I needed to hear","This book is so God. Only God could possibly redeem the broken parts of our life and use them to make us whole. What a contradiction in terms, but Lon says that it is imperative to come to this place and that it is essential in order for us to be free and effective for the Kingdom.He references people in the Bible who had lived ordinary lives until God allowed them to be broken.This book is just what I needed and I have passed on several copies to others close to me who are suffering in some way. I enjoyed the content very much and am still wrestling with Lon's chapter that addresses whether I want the 'Product' more than the ""Process."" What was he doing, reading my mind?"
5,"This Lightnin Disc ROCKS, it rolls, and it JUKES!!!","I'm a serious Sam Hopkins fanatic having over 20 of his discs in my collection, this by far is my favorite. It was stolen from my car recently and I was greatly aggrivated, hence coming to Amazon to purchase. Mr. Hopkins was virtuoso guitarist, an underrated vocalist, and a folk poet's poet! If you don't like this disc, you just don't like music."
1,Piece of junk,"We purchased one of the winders for my son for Christmas. In examining the ""new"" product, we found string tangled and knotted through the gears. I disassembled the winder to try and untangle the string, but was unable to do so. Looking inside the device, however, did reveal just how cheaply the thing is made. This is definitely a ripoff. When my son flies his kite in the spring, I'll suggest he roll the line around a stick as we used to do rather than waste any money on another winder."
1,Nice Try,If you want bloody knuckles and aren't worried about trying to get the up or down in any orderly fashion this is the unit for you.
1,don't buy this,"after about a half hour of using this, the line was tangled inside the winder. so i took it apart and untangled it. its a good idea, but it needs to be made a little more solidly."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"Don't even waste your time buying this! I shopped around for so long to find a nice floating bed to lay in the pool. I found this and was so excited! I blew it up, put it in the pool, and tried to lay on it. TERRIBLE!! It is very shaky and has terrible balance. I am only 5'7"" but found it very uncomfortable for my length. I had to find a position to try and sit in so the thing wouldn't tip over. I fell out twice!! I never fall off of floating beds! DON'T GET THIS. Would absolutely not recommend this to anyone. Guarantee the model in the picture was trying her best not to fall off. Even one slight wave will make the thing tip."
2,Must have good balance to sit on this float,Well built float. The problem is that you have to have good balance to sit on it. I like the hole in the bottom to put your feet when you want to cool off your feet. Good float but hang on.
4,Short legs,"The model sitting in this chair must have deceivingly short legs... Chair is advertised as 66"" but is well under at about 56"". Wish that it was actual length advertised(I'm 5'10 and it's a little short, perfect for my 5'3 girlfriend) but besides that a very comfortable float with place to dunk legs"
3,Swimline 66 inch,"Bought these for my husband and I, they are a little difficult for us to get on them. There is a large opening in them where your knees would lie. Not sure of the purpose but it was ok for the kids they would flip over as well trying to get on but not as much as me and my husband. Very commical getting on them though, it actually made for some really good laughs if thats what your looking for. My husband found it more comfortable to flip it over and lay on it that way."
2,Lounge Chair - Poor quality...,"I received two (2) of these chairs. Within one week, one of them kept losing air. Holding the chair underwater would not reveal the leak. My 30-day return window passed me buy, so just trashed it. The other is doing fine. More fine quality from China."
4,Great product at a great price!,"I ordered this for our Intex above ground pool and it's great. Packaging was fine, product didn't have any defects or holes in it although it came with a repair patch just in case like most floats do. I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5 simply because it's not the easiest float to get into. I had to jump onto it from the ladder. Otherwise, it's great!"
1,Float pops easily,"At first I was like hey wow awesome float,then I laid in it. Not long enough,and i am 5'8"". Also it popped within the first month on the top part and bottom part. So the length sucks and the seams suck . Buy something else."
1,not what I'd hoped,"Each summer I buy a new float for my pool. The price on this was more than I've spent on other floats but I should have heeded the reviews. It is shorter than most floats, and the backrest sits at an uncomfortable angle, so if you like to read a book while on the float, it is not the most comfortable. For some reason it also feels unsturdy; any slight movement to left or right risks tilting over. In fact, I did tip into the pool at one point, with my library book in hand! It took forever to fill the float using the pump that connects to the car, and after the first day it seemed to lose air though there is no apparent leak. I think I am going to go back to buying the $8 floats from WalMart!"
4,Shadows on the Stars--Great Book,You can feel every second of each page as the story goes. The characters were well developed so I felt like I knew them. It is easy to read except for some of the character names.
2,Incorrect programming,The approach to string pointers in this book is wrong. I have a working understanding of C and after reading the first 102 pages of this book I can tell you not to get this. It will set you back instead of helping you write solutions.I wonder how many of the examples in this book were actually compiled to see if they work. I know the one on page 102 definitely was not. This will not help you if you are trying to learn.
4,Excellent starter,I just purchased this book and already it proven invaluable learning resource. I especially like the string handling techniques.Some of these techniques should be used in college courses as they can prove to be techniques students would use frequently.
5,Good discussion on threads,"Finally, a book that addresses threads in a meaningful way. Lots of working code examples that launch, synchronize, and prioritize threads."
5,Great bag for mirrorless kits.,"It took me a while to find the right size bag for my pen camera kit. This one fits my Epl-5 body without lens attached sideways in the right hand corner. then I can fit Oly 45mm, 40-150mm, panni 14mm, sig 19mm and 30mm. The flash and spare battery fit in front pocket with extra room and I still have the two side pockets to spare. This one is built like a tank (like all lowepro pruducts) and I'm sure will last for years. I wish someone had wrote a review like this when I was looking for the right bag. Took me three tries to get it right. Tried the Zeikos as it was cheap but there is no padding in that bag. Do not recommend that one! If you have a mirrorless with a few lenses and want to make one kit then buy this bag, period. you will be delighted."
5,Breast pump carrier...,"Yea, you read right. I'm actually using this as a carrier for my medela pump in style breast pump. I didn't care for the backpack so I ripped out the pump and put it in this Lowepro Edit 140 bag. It fits perfectly and has kept my pump safe and sound for the past 9 months. It holds it perfectly (the pump has velcro on it to keep it in place) and has room to spare to hold Medela all the pump accessories (valves, tubing and bags)."
4,paul sebastian gift set (s),This product has a pleasing aroma along with a manly scent. I recomend this for partys and dates that where you want to empress. one word GREAT les
1,disappointment,"First the package was hard to open. The deodorant stick dried up and was gone. I even called Customer Service, but nobody help. Because the item was so old, the smell of the scent was not what I expected. I decided not to use it.It was a total disappointment."
1,God awful smell - a total waste of money,"I have to admit that I was stupid for hastily ordering any cologne but for some reason I thought it wouldn't matter so much. I learned my lesson and if I could I would have returned this, I tried it and felt like ""a sleaze bag"" or something like that. The worst, it will attract low-lifes to you so watch out!!!"
1,Pure Satire,"I randomly came across this dvd with low expectations; it was worse than I imagined. The crowd actual ""boo's"" the actor playing Darwin when he's introduced (which tells you something about the demographic audience). The way Calvin carries on against Darwin borders on satire and unintentional comedy. For anyone who's serious about studying science and religion in a cooperative effort, I wouldn't recommend this dvd unless you want a good laugh or to dissuade someone from becoming a Christian. Sorry for the harsh criticisms, but I didn't find this production to be worthwhile whatsoever."
2,Nothing special,"This bag is a little disappointing. It is not big enough for serious shopping. I bought another bag at a discount grocery store that is not only twice the size, but lighter in weight and only cost me a buck. I also have another bag by another company that is very light in weight, four times the size and finally wearing out after a decade. I suppose the Planet Bag is okay for the price. But there is nothing special about it."
5,Very useful review of arithmetic and its applications,I have found this book to be very easy to read. It really help me to refresh some of the basic concepts and understand how to do arithmetic in bases different than the decimal. I really liked the fact that it used what I already knew about arithmetic to teach me the new concepts. I highly recommend thls book. Plenty of exercises and nice introduction to statistics.
4,Comfortable yet pretty,"I thought my feet are very wide, so I ordered the W size but it runs pretty big and ended up being quite loose. But other than that it is comfortable and looks pretty. A great weekend sandal."
3,Run Small,"I normally wear an 8.5-9 W, but couldn't even get my foot down in this shoe. They run small. I returned them."
4,Flying Music,"Perfect flying music, put on the Bose NR headphones and off we go. Takes the edge off those long flights. Very relaxing, very good."
2,Not easily understandable,The author should have made this text more student friendly. It was very confusing at times. This book is not worth its cost!
2,Return this book after course is completed,"This book was over done ? this book will confuse an accounting student. In fact, they recommend that you purchase a study guide to go along with this book (what does that tell you!!!). Along with a poor accounting lecture you are doomed to barely pass an accounting class with this book. The write up and description of general concepts ? extends to some far out, drawn out, and exacerbated lecture that may have been written by satanic worshipers or something like that. I bought the study guide to go along with this book after I did so poorly on my first exam and now I know why a few did well on their exam?s ? because they bought the study guide!!! The study guide should be used as the main study concept and leave this heavy weighted book on the shelf?"
1,I have not received the book at this date (1 month later),I purchased the book on march 25th 2010 and I have not received the book yet (april 26 2010)
1,Hard to comprehend,"This book is not a good accounting book because the goal of any textbook is to make it easier for the student to understand the material in class. In the case of this book, it will most likely make this process much harder. If your class is using this book, I recommend going to class as this book is very hard to follow along."
2,ISBN,"The publisher has two versions of the book, each the 10th Edition but with different ISBN numbers. So before you order be careful which one your class is using."
3,"More caddy, less golfer","The book was interesting but I would have perferred more information on the caddies, their lives and environment, and less on the known stories of the golfers and their wins."
3,Depends on your motherboard on whether will work well or not,Nice product but I upgraded my motherboard and apparently there are conflicts with the chipsets. Just make sure yours doesn't because otherwise is a good product.
4,Solid Mouse,"I got this mouse for my Laptop. It works great, and unlike optical mice, this one produces no blinding light from the bottom. Actually shows no light at all. It's nothing spectacular, but its great mouse for anyone looking for a standard mouse, or a mouse with one or two extra buttons."
2,"Agree; wonderful pictures, do not trust the text","The author has indeed found and printed some wonderful illustrations, especially the paintings, but his text cannot be relied upon. This book needed much more rigorous fact-checking."
3,Great pictures; Terrible text,"This book contains among the best illustrations and the worst-researched text imaginable. It is truly recommended for the images, the prints, the photos... but DO NOT pay any attention to the captions or the words, which are inaccurate at best and wildly misleading at worst. A good coffee-table book, but a lousy history."
4,Brake servo,"This remanufactured vacuum servo unit replaced a 20 year old original perfectly. It fit correctly, is quiet in operation and holds vacuum well."
2,INFOMMERCIAL IN DISGUISE,"Much of this book felt like I was watching an infommercial for UDAP pepper spray, except I was not only wasting my time, but also my money, by paying for the commercial by buying this book. I was firmly convinced (prior to reading this book) of the value of pepper spray as a LAST RESORT defense against bear attack- after abiding by all the known SOPs for avoiding surprising or provoking bears. This book is an ad for a product produced by an admitted friend of the author, Mike Matheny of UDAP. I have nothing personal against Mr Matheny, but this method of stealth advertising will only cause me to continue to carry Counter Assault exclusively, which, with common sense and good luck, I have never had to use while travelling in bear country."
4,"great ""bear"" read","This book is very well written and offers many interesting bear attack stories. The only negative aspect about it was that its main purpose was to promote the use of bear spray, and if you're reading it for the attack factor it's written more in an educational capacity than one that will entertain you."
1,exactly same information of every questions and pictures like other ged science i had before.,don't they have any new informations for science book. i finish all my studies but i want to study more and only some basis studies are not enough to explores more.
5,One of the best soundtracks in my collection...It brings you,"right back to the film, but at the same time it can stand alone as a CD full of wonderful musical compositions. I like Gabriel Yared as a composer, and I must say that he created a perfect background for the movie: he managed to bring Arabian desert winds and Hungarian folks sounds together, with the help of Maria Sebastian's wonderful voice. Jazz compositions were also well-chosen. Overall, I'd say this CD includes every single piece of music, featured during the film."
5,"Strange, lovely, haunting,","This soundtrack is a blend of Bach, jazz, and Bedouin music. The odd and wonderful thing about this CD is how harmoniously it all works. Highly recommended."
5,The greatest film soundtrack of all time.,"Okay, a bold statement and entirely subjective. Still, it is so very rare that a soundtrack is able to precisely capture the mood of a story. Anyone who has read Ondaatje's wonderful book would already identify with Yared's soundtrack. But more, this is also an album that stands on its own. Convento Di Santa'Anna is, by itself, worth the price. Haunting, lyrical, memorable. This is a soundtrack for dreamers, thinkers, artists, travelers. Ella Fitzgerald! Fred Astaire! This is music to transport you across time, into a desert and to a world of smoking jackets, sophisticated jazz and a distain for borders. If you don't own this soundtrack, haven't read the book, seen the movie: FIX. THAT. NOW."
5,A BEAUTIFUL MIX!,"It seems as though people either really loved the movie or hated it (I adored it), but I can't believe the reviews would be mixed on this soundtrack. It is simply wonderful; a beautiful mix of ethnic and and haunting music, it's a good part of why I loved the movie. Wonderfully scored you should do yourself a favor and pick this up soon!"
2,bland,"I have no idea why this won the academy award. Maybe it was because of the weak competition that year. I saw the movie and enjoyed it and the music went well with the movie but this soundtrack on its own is eminently forgettable. The high points are the tracks by Fred Astaire, Ella and Benny Goodman."
2,"Very Boring, Not Recommended","This was not at all what I thought it would be. From beginning to end the score was slow and completly dull, not a bit romantic. The music in the film was sequenced perfectly so that the music filled the emotions at that time. But when you listen to the soundtrack without the film you are simply turned off and disappointed. Repetative melodies can get old after a while, this score proves just that."
1,English Patient review,"I bought this CD based on another customer's review, re: they said it was their favorite of over 200 soundtracks they possessed. Whew. I've got to ask what the other soundtracks are that they possess?! :0( To be honest, I haven't listened to the entire soundtrack yet, but what I've heard is awful bland, when compared to the several dozen other soundtracks I have....I hate to be a downer, but maybe that's why I got this cd for 15 cents??? :0(Sorry.Sigh-ned,""Blase'"""
5,beautiful Music,"I am so glad i ordered this cd from amazon.I couldn,t get it in any music shops.The music is very haunting and beautiful and i enjoy it as much as the film which i look at over and over again.Thank you Amazon.A happy customer C J Venour."
5,Eng Patient Soundtrack,"Exceptional backgroud music for a formal social room in a house, lodge, club or hotel. Great supplier as well. Thanks, Carl"
1,Can't keep it in,"It's a nice looking fryer and seems to heat up fine, that is, if you can keep the cord in. The plug isn't a tight fit; rather, it's magnetically attached.The positive/negative poles of the power are small plates (both on the fryer and the cord) about the size of hearing aid batteries held in place by a two magnets, also about the size of hearing aid batteries. The problem is that the cord is heavier than the magnets can sustain, and constantly falls out. I have to prop my cord in, and even then it doesn't always stay.Steer clear.Pros: Compact.Cons: Cord is always falling out; lacks timer.Recommended: NoBottom Line: I've only used it once; returning to the store because the design is so poor. I had to babysit it instead of preparing the rest of my meal."
5,The best,"I've tried 3 different brands of ice shavers and this is by far the best. It's simple, convenient, sturdy design and very durable. No special ice molds needed like other brands, just regular ice cubes. Just throw a cup of ice cubes in and with a gentle touch of a button, shaved ice comes out! Our favorites are Coke slushies and OJ slushies. We've been making several per day for months now and have never even replaced a blade. My brother has two, one for the house & one for the cabin."
2,"Looks Fine, But Broke in 2 Days","I enjoy reading reviews before I buy products, but failed to review this one before I bought it. We tried to fly it two seperate days, and the first was unsuccessful, then next one it actually broke. I then tossed it. I would recommend another kind of kite, this one was show without function."
5,Truly only one Tabasco.,"Whenever I eat at a new diner -- and in Jersey we have many fine ones -- I order a Taylor Ham and cheddar omelette, and ask for a bottle of Tabasco when it arrives. If I get Texas Pete or some other substitution, I just pass, because it's not even close: Tabasco has the aged vinegar and pepper taste unique among its peers. It's hot without being too hot, and the flavor, if one acquires the taste for it, can make your breakfast omelette or lunchtime chicken soup much improved for the addition."
4,Good product but...,Great product for the money. My only complaint is that the diffuser falls off occasionally. I would buy it again however.
1,disappointed with Andis,I purchased this product a few months ago and was initially happy with the product. That is until the hairdryer exploded while I was drying my hair. Scariest thing ever. Red plastic pieces flying everywhere with smoke coming from the dryer. The dryer was not damaged or dropped prior to the explosion. I contacted the company and have not heard from them.
1,Hair Dryer blew up in my hand....shocked and burned,"I purchased this blow dryer and was initially happy with it until it EXPLODED IN MY HAND while I was drying my hair. I first felt a weird sensation going up my arm and then a huge hot stab in my back right before the dryer EXPLODED IN MY HAND, with pieces flying everywhere the motor was still running and I could not release it from my grip. It hurt so bad and feels like my insides in my back are on fire! Not only am I in pain, it scared me pretty bad! I will be getting a completely different dryer now. I will never purchase another Andis dryer!"
1,BUYER BEWARE! DANGEROUS! BUY WITH CAUTION!,"THE DRYER WORKED GREAT FOR MY HAIR. I SELDOMLY USED IT AND I NEVER DROPPED IT. WHILE USING IT ONE DAY, THE MOTOR EXPLODED FROM THE BACK OF THE DRYER AND HIT ME IN THE FACE. I TURNED IT ON AND HEARD A STRANGE NOISE. SO NATURALLY, I DECIDED TO TURN IT OFF TO SEE WHAT COULD BE WRONG. BEFORE I COULD TURN IT OFF, IT HAD ALREADY EXPLODED AND SMOKE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE DRYER! PIECES OF THE DRYER HIT ME IN THE FACE. QUITE HARD! I DON'T KNOW IF THE ONE I RECEIVED WAS DEFECTIVE OR IF THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL DRYER. CAUTION TO ALL!"
2,Explosive Experience,"I would previously have been skeptical reading those reviews of the hair dryer exploding, but it just happened to me. This was a great, attractive and reliable hair dryer for, for more than four years. This morning about two or three seconds after I turned it on, wham! the fan inside fractured and blew out the side of the case. Fortunately with the dryer aimed at me, it blew out sideways, so just startled, no harm. It's obvious from this experience, and now reading previous reviews, that there is a pattern of this occurring. I would not give it a low rating for what seemed a fluke physical failure, but since it's not isolated, and this replaced a 20+ year old Sunbeam dryer that never failed, and I just got tired of, I see no other choice than to score this one low."
1,Defective (twice) - do not buy,"I purchased this dryer and it was defective. The casing simply pulled apart at the handle and the screws that should have held it together could not be tightened. I ordered a replacement (which came right away, thank you, Amazon) and it had the same defect. The handle simply pulls apart. I don't think that's my bad luck - I think there is a problem with the assembly."
3,Nice product,The item was packaged well but we were missing the diffuser for some reason not sure what happened but package was received very quickly.
3,my bad...,"I purchased this blow dryer to use at work.Andis has been a professional company around a long time; I happily unpacked it and took it along with me to work, only to discover that of the three attachments that accompany the blow dryer, only the diffuser fit. Niether of the two concentrator attachments would stay on the nozzle of the dryer due to their inner construction. The dryer itself is also quite loud and makes it hard to hear the customer. Silly me threw away packaging w/out reading the Amazon return policy which wants things returned in original packaging....my bad. So now I'm stuck with a loud blow dryer at home, and purchased a different blow dryer elsewhere for work. I probably won't buy anything more with the Andis name, as it was made in China.Such a shame a good name has lost it's quality, and quality control. My dealing with Amazon through this purchase was prompt, and only my fault that I didn't read everything before I tossed the packaging. Oops!"
3,Dryes quickly but super loud!,Bought this for my mom to try it out because her $150 dryer went out after 9years and she said it dryes almost as quickly as her old one but is super loud! And does not leave hair feeling or looking as smooth and shiny as her old one. You get what you pay for.
5,VER PLEASED,Very pleased with this product. Drying time is cut in half compared to other blow dryers!
4,Makes a difference,"I used one of these blow dryers at a Hyatt in San Antonio and really liked it. My hair feels softer and has more body with this one. It's heavier than I remembered, but I wouldn't exchange it."
1,Lasted 1 month,This hairdryer lasted me one month! It started overheating and some plastic piece that must have been inside the dryer started burning. Ihad already thrown all packing and attachments out so I just tossed the hairdryer in the trash. Bought a new red hardryer at Walmart for $15.00.
3,hiardryer,I love the way this dries my hair and love all the heat settings. I really wanted a concentrator to help control frizz. This came with 3 great attachements but they do not stay on and after 4 uses my concentrator fell off and cracked. If you do not want the attachements then this is the perfect dryer.
1,DANGEROUS!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!,BE WARNED ---- Don't buy unless you want a fire on your hands. IF YOU HAVE ONE THROW IT AWAY!!! This product exploded in my hands just as I plugged it in and I have only had it for a few weeks. If you read other reviews on this you will see that this is not the first or second time that this has happened and the supplier is refusing to refund. Totally shabby treatment all around!!!! AMAZON SHOULD REMOVE IT FROM THEIR SITE!!!Andis 82075 Tourmaline/Ionic Hair Dryer
2,controls are self directed,"There are only two heat settings on this hair dryer - Warm and Hot. But you really don't have to choose one or the other - the dryer does it for you. The control sort of drifts back and forth from warm to hot to warm, etc. And there are only two blower speeds - High and Low. The low setting is barely a puff of a breeze and the high setting is enough to blow over a brick building. The dryer is also very heavy.There are MUCH better dryers out there......"
4,Like it but....,"Yea I can agree with everyone's review about how it is heavier than most dryers. It is also much louder too. Compared to my old dryer, it sounds like somebody's going through my house with damn leaf blower. They should have 3 speeds on that thing because it doesn't just sound like a leaf blower, it feels like one too. The ""low"" on this dryer is my old dryers ""high"". It does do the job when it comes to getting your hair dry fast though! : )"
2,Pros and cons,"Pros: Many attachments, price is good, attractive, dries quickly, no damage.Cons: So heavy to use and that factor alone is enough to cancel out any of the pros. The weight is also unbalanced, so when you grip the handle in the place that best balances it out, you wind up hitting buttons. The attachments fly off and hit you in the head midstream (especially the diffuser). Not recommended. You can do better."
2,Broke after a year,"I really liked the ionic technology. It dries hair a lot faster. However, after a year of owning this, it broke. I had to buy another dryer from Amazon, and I chose a different one--the Conair 213x Infiniti Professional Tourmaline dryer. I noticed that the sound on the Conair (when on ""high"" setting) was a lot quieter than the Andis.I get the impression that the motor on the Conair is of a higher quality than that of the Andis."
4,Great Value!,"Excellent hair dryer for the money! Drying time is cut by half, great tools included. My only wish is that it didn't weigh so much. It is a bit heavy but on the upside, by biceps are more sculpted now. :) So...you can save about $200 dollars for this model and have a heavier dryer or purchase a T3 which performs the same but is wayyy lighter.Decisions...decisions... :)"
2,Attachment cannot attached!!,"The reason I chose this one was because of the 3 attached parts, they looked great and useful. But turned out those cannot be attached. All three always falled down after ~15 seconds, so no use at all. This dryer is a little heavy but acceptable because the air is powerful enough to make the hair dry fast. Overall, I am very disappointed for the ""special features"". Its design has a major problem, should make it just as the bottle top.Updates 2/21/11After 7 months, it is not ""hot"" enough, just a little more than warm. My old travel dryer is even better than this."
3,attachments do not attach!,"I can't get the attachments to stay on at all. I put the diffuser on my counter, put the hairdryer in it, and pounded the dryer with my fist. It flew off in a matter of minutes. I find the control switches are awkward as well. While gripping the handle I manage to turn it off or change the heat setting while drying my hair. It is powerful and does dry hair. I haven't noticed any ""super smooth"" dries however.1/23/12- I guess on a plus side, this darn thing hasn't died yet. I still manage to have problems with the on/off switch."
2,What were the authors thinking?,"I'd write a longer review, but thinking back to reading this book aggravates me too much. For quality and most readers, myself included, this book merits 1 star. The 2 star rating is for those interested in a massively in-depth look at perhaps the two most dangerous crises of the Cold War, the authors' use of US and USSR sources, and crisis management theorists, who should go hog-wild over this work."
1,no good,I order these for my new cell phone because it dropped lots of calls.When i recieved them in the mail i put one in my phone but my phone just keeped on dropping calls.So these do not work at all in your phone.
3,Slight improvement,The increase in reception is passive and perhaps 7-10% enhancement to cell phone onboard antenna. I ordered these due to the fact I was submitting an order for other cell related items.
1,cell phone internal booster,THIS ITEM HELPS SOME BUT NOT A LOT. NEED THE REPEATER TO HELP BOOST SIGNAL. THIS DISTRIBUTOR DID NOT READ THE DESCRIPTION OF THE ORDER. HAD TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE 3 X.
3,something good whatever,"After putting 3 days on my phone I did notice better reception. My phone is a att pantech crossover. I did notice better cellular reception reception ,but for WiFi and Bluetooth. It did nothing to helpStill no reception places I never got it. And the new signal is barely noticeable but it's still better. kind ofYour actual results will very and if you're looking for a major signal boost and don't even think about this"
3,Decent,"Worked great for my wife's phone, not so well for mine. However, that being said, I do notice a slightly improved signal, even though I'm in an area where the signal is generally very weak or non-existant."
2,Does it work? Probably not.,"In my home on a cheap Nokia phone the reception was very unreliable before I put in this sticker. Did it improve anything? I do no know. The reception is still bad. If it made any difference? Hard to tell.On my expensive, Android smart phone there was no reception before I put in the sticker, and there is none now, whatsoever.You can buy signal boosters for a $100 and up. It is hard to believe that a little device for pennies could be effective."
3,Its ok for what I paid for it,Its ok for what I paid for it but it doesnt work as well as I had hoped. For me it gave me one more bar then I would usually have so it does help a little bit.
4,Helps,"Not a miracle fix but it works good enough to make it worth the price. If you have no reception at all I doubt this will help but if you have poor reception, it does help a bit."
1,crap,these things are ajoke they do nothing for the phone but for the price it was a fun thing to try. but really not worth a dime
1,Don't both,I have a My Touch with T-mobile. This did absolutely nothing. Waste of money. It comes with 6 and I tried each one of them.
3,Cell Phone Booster Fact vs. Fiction,The 2nd generation cell phone booster works fine if you have at least 2-3 bars of signal strength and are looking for a boost. It will not perform a miracle nor allow a cell phone whose internal antenna is totally damaged to work or pick up a signal. However it will add a bar or two to a phone that has decent reception to being with.
3,Hard to tell if they worked,"Hard to tell if they worked, but I had really bad reception with ATT in my area since I moved here from an area where ATT was the big seller. It did seem to kind of improve after I put multiple on."
3,Good Product,"I purchased this product because a friend told me that they work well. I was able to catch signal in places I normaly couldnt. Even in weaker spaces, the bars jump one bar more than normal."
1,DON'T BUY,"It might be cheap, but don't waste your money. It did absolutely no good on my LG Esteem. If you decide to try it make sure you pay attention to the quantity."
1,Horrible!!,Don't bother wasting your money on this product. I tried it on three different phones and it didn't improve anything on any of them!! The ONLY reason I gaved it one star is because it wouldn't allow me to leave zero.
1,What a complete joke,"The joke must be on me for EVER thinking that something like this would ever work. Save your money. I got taken, but it doesn't mean you should be."
1,do not buy... does nothing,This product did not help my signal to increase. It claimed to improve coverage and guess what!! FAIL to do what it was supposed to do. Do not waste your money on cheap products that say that can xo great things and are cheap. I would say you get less than you paid for... And it was already cheap
2,easy to use,easy to use dont take much to install but they dont seem to do much good.i didnt see any different in the signal on my phone even using two of them together like the package says you can.its cheap if you want to give it a try but it just didnt work for me.well packaged didnt take long to get them
2,So So,"Works on some phones, others not a bit. Can't believe these are even sold yet... Got them for all my family and friends. Not worth getting in my honest opinion."
2,is useless,"is useless, my phone never had more signal, or putting the six simultaneously.. is uselessis uselessis uselessis useless, is useless"
1,No boost....,"Didn't expect wonders, if fact I was more curious than desperate to see if such a product would really enhance the reception of my cell. All said, not surprisingly no enhancement resulted....at least it was unexpensive."
2,does not work,CAN NOT USE ON I PHONE so was of no value to me might work on older phones but do not recommend for new phone
1,Junk,Sorry folks..... This thing doesn't work. Don't you think that if a sticker with some metal bands embedded in it helped reception that the cell phone manufacturer would have added it. Especially since the stickers probably cost about $.09 eachGimme a break.
1,Doesn't work for my purposes,"I have a weird problem with my reception: full-empty-full-analog ..... basically my phone doesn't drop calls, but won't make/receive them half the time either. I usually have more consistent signal in my kitchen so I was hoping this sticker would make the 10ft to my room a little better. No luck for me, but maybe it's just my weird problem. Logically, I don't see how this is more than a sticker. But I gave in and tried it based on a couple positive reviews that seemed real (increasing basement signal etc). So make your own choice. Good luck."
1,Antenna Booster practically useless,"Please do not waste yoour money on this. It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it. Waste your money if you want but, I am speaking from experience. It does not help."
2,Just OK,"I cannot see any significant advantage of Antenna Booster...Maybe, it will increase a little bit signal..."
1,cell phone antenna boosters that are not boosters,This product didn't do anything for my phone or anyone else's phone I put it in!!!! I wish I would of never bought this product. My phone had 2 bars on it before I installed it and when I put it in it still had 2 bars on it then it would fluctuate between 2 and 1 bars after I restarted the phone. Then I put one in a government phone and it didn't help either before i put it in it had 2 bars but after I put it in it had no service at all!!!!! I did everything like the instructions said to also!!!! i could give it no rating i would!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Big joke,"I thought by adding this to my cell phone I would get better service. Well it did not change a thing, I gave the others to friends and they had no luck either. I do not blame anyone about this cause it was me just thinking it would work. : ("
1,i was fooled,you do not get a 6 pack you only get 1 of them do not be fooled i was very upset that it only came with one and i do not liked to be tricked like that
4,DELIGHTED TO LEARN THIS,Glad to know somebody reviewed this book.I have a deep interest in the Shoshone history....though I ama white causcasian female . Was searching for ONE book abouttheir history ..prior to white contact. Looks like there areat least 3 books about Shoshone history. Too bad mostAmericans have just forgotten about our Native Americans.THANK you also for recommending the historical fiction bookmentioned in the first review.Sounds very interesting to me.
1,Costly Mistake,"This after shave use to be found all over, then it seemingly was discontinued. But I found it on Amazon. I assumed the high price was because it was still so good, not that it was a matter of dwindling supply. This was a bottle that I think had been sitting on the shelf for years. The contents had separated, the dispenser was defective (does not dispense product) and the scent was nearly non-existent. Very disappointing. This was a costly mistake."
1,WARNING: classic architecture no longer supported,"I can't review the game because I could never get it to play. Current Mac operating systems no longer support ""classic architecture"", which means, in a nutshell, they don't play older games like Starship Titanic."
3,It could have been so good,"Douglas Adams, hero, no god, to many of us. How could he be so good and the game miss the mark by so far? Amusing, yes. But the humor is not sustained, the funny bits are funny for a bit but once you've seen the funny gags the whole thing is just a bit sad. And don't get me started about the door that cannot be opened and the room you cannot enter. There is nothing so frustrating as having a bit that you just can't get to. Kind of makes the whole thing not worth the effort.Still, we love Douglas Adams. So, I'll be first in line to plunk down 40 bucks when he makes his next one. I sure hope it'll be good..."
4,"Angel's hot, but...",All these shots I've seen before! A must for any Angel fan. Now we need an 'Essential Oz'
4,A small letdown,This book is pretty good but I was hoping for more on Angel's history not just some pictures and a few quotes
1,I didnt like it.,It was complicated and I didnt know what was happening. I do not reccommend this book. Avoid it at all costs.
4,I like it.,"I think this is a good book. I think some of the people who write these reviews are not the intended audience. I don't think this book was written for expert players. It's written for people who are beginners and want to start playing the game without being crushed in the opening. This book won't cause you win every game. I don't think that's possible with a 24 hour repertiore. However, it will give you some good ideas to think about and will get through most games with a playable position. Most opening books have a ton of variations and very little explanation. Purdy is a great chess teacher and explains all the main ideas. It's true that these openings may not be the best according to modern theory. However, this book was intended as 24 hour repertiore for players rated 1900 and under. I think it's good in that respect."
1,Collectible Item,"You cannot trust the opening system outlined in this book. The side notes of Tykodi reveal too much flaws in the system. The system may work 30 years ago but I doubt if it can be played today even in club games.A major flaw of this book is the absence of examples from grandmaster games (Nunn's strict requirement for an opening book). Purdy even gave his wife's game as an illustration.If you want a book as an addition to your collection, this book may be for you. But if you are expecting to build a repertoire based on this book, forget it.An example of how a repertoire book should be is Summerscale's ""A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire"". Unfortunately, this book deals only with white's repertoire."
1,Doesnt work,"The only topical solution that works is pediMd. I have had nail fungus for over ten years..sporanox hurt my liver and gave me muscle weakness, and lamisil did nothing...as well as every other ""gel"" or ""cream"""
1,Waste of time and money,I would give it 0 star if I could. I wasted 6 months on this useless lotion. It makes your nail worse! You better off stay away from it.
4,Works but......,"A Dermatologist told me to gently file the yellowish fungus off of the nails and then apply the product. Well, I used a Dremel and filed all the fungus off all the infected nails. I then put the product on each morning and evening after I showered and dried the feet. After a month the new nail was visible on some of the toes and it seems that it is working. The trick is the filing off of the fungus first. Remember, the fungus is in and under the nail and the filing of the nails gets the product to the fungus."
5,amazed,"I have to say I'm amazed because I was highly skeptical. I have tried everything over the years and nothing worked, and I stuck with it six months or more to see some kind of results. I bought this about six weeks ago and already I see half of my healthy nails growing out in front of the infected area. I'm sold on this and just ordered 2 more bottles for once a week maintenance once I get all my healthy nail grown out. This stuff works and my nails were bad; 15 year sufferer here, and this works!"
3,Takes time,"I've used this before. It took some time. But , it worked. This time, not yet. It will take time."
5,WORKS AND NICE PRODUCT,"I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT MYSELF, AND MY SON, THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT! YES! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO OTHERS OR EVEN GIVE IT AS A GIFT, IF NEED BE, (FUNNI)."
3,Man in the Squashed Yellow Hat,"This costume gives you a whole lotta yellow for the price. The only problem is that the brim of the Yellow Hat is made of foam and it comes folded in the packaging. Think ""Man in the Squashed Yellow Hat"". I grabbed some yellow posterboard and reinforced the hat and it was fine."
