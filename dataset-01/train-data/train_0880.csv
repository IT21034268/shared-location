5,Excellent,"WOW....This book really shows John Kerry for the coward and fraud he really is. O'Neal provides relevant interviews and documentation from the Boston Globe and other well known publications/sources as evidence. There is no spin at all just a sobering dosage of truth. I wondered how a man could get three purple hearts, the bronze star, and the silver star in only three months - ON A BOAT!!!"
1,This book should be catergorized as fiction,If this were a book in the fiction genre it would maybe be worth the read. However it is being sold as truth by a right wing book publishing company Regenery. Shame!
1,Non-Fiction?,I wasn't even half done with this book before many of the statements in it were proven false. Every day more and more information comes out that makes this book seem more fiction than Non-Fiction.What makes matters worse is that this book is very poorly written and is a chore to try and slog your way through. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
1,Ever Wonder....,"Did it occur to anyone that the ""reviewers"" who are so incensed about Amazon's change in review policy have written only one review....FOR THIS BOOK!But I'm sure these are loyal customers....yeah, right."
1,Think people,"Can American's be that easily herded like sheep as to believe anything in print or on T.V.? This information is NOT based on fact, these authors considered themselves as ""there serving with Kerry"" because they were in Vietnam at the same time. There misinformation is fueled by anger (which they totally admit) for Kerry speaking honestly about the war atrocities. Why, by the way, is that considered disloyal by other veterans? He stood up for what he believed to be right by speaking out against the atrocities in the war that now we would all agree occurred and shouldn't have. He wanted to bring them out in the open so that they can be addressed and move toward changing them. He did this despite the disdain he was surely to incur as a result? I call that integrity."
5,Ahh...Those Purple Hearts,"Anyone who ACTUALLY READS THE BOOK can tell that it is true. Today Admiral Schacte confirmed the swifties account of the first purple heart incident. But it was even more damning. Kerry not only lied to get the medal after being turned down by Hibbard, he claimed in his book to be the commander during the mission, without even mentioning Schacte, who was the actual commander. Kerry is as scummy as they come. And to all you 1-Star lurkers out there pretending to have read the book, you can thank the swifties when you wake up November 3 to find that your Commander in Chief for the next four years will be George Bush."
1,this just in,"CONSUMER CONFIDENCE HITS LOWEST LEVEL IN SEPTEMBER '05 SINCE 1990.I.e., the LOWEST level since George the First was prez.Good job, GII, you've worked hard to earn that 38% approval rating."
4,Very well documented and detailed.,"This book documents, via the first hand accounts of dozens of men, the escapades of John Kerry while he was in Viet Nam. From the whining about danger to taking an unauthorized trip with his boat to Saigon, ostensibly to hook up with some prostitutes. A compelling documentary about someone who aspires to the presidency, and started his campaign in the 60's."
1,Amazon should be ashamed of itself.....,"I think it is shocking that Amazon has suspended its normal policy and is encouraging the most outright, partisan exchanges. This is not the roleof a retailer to encourage one position or another and I will make it a practicenever to purchase anything from you again. We are in enough trouble in thiscountry with the right-wing atmosphere permeating the media and I would certainly not have expected that from a major bookseller."
1,"half of what you see, none of what you read","or is it vice versea. Oh hell fool me once.. hey did we just get fooled again. hope not.I expect opinons of this nature, however slanted, biased or misrepresented. Which is their point in writing it, which is fine. Sometimes people need that. However, not a good read if you actually wish to learn anything, or any relative facts.when will we learn? i am starting to wonder if this place I have lived my entire life, that i have been taught about in school, is something other than what i have been taught? What I am taught about morals encompasses way more, yet it was not represented today."
2,My rating is for my review,"Well, like everyone else, I didn't read the book as it isn't available yet. I am absolutely fascinated by the 'Who's got the biggest' contest being waged by passionate conservatives and passionate liberals.So my review, for Liberals: This is absolute rubbish, I tore mine up and it is hanging in the smallest room in the house ready for use.For Republicans: This is the truth, as good as a copy of the Bible that arrived by fax machine from God. How could anyone possibly question it?Or maybe we should all zip up, read the book when its published, check some facts and then spew bile at each other?Alternatively we could all boycott all of these books from left and right. Because if the reviews of these and others (Al Franken etc) are anything to go by then they, and the tone of this years debate, are dividing the nation.And that is truly a win for the terrorists."
1,John Kerry : Powerful Leader,"Let's make a book called John Kerry: Powerful Leader!!! John Kerry knows what he wants to do, and he also knows how to use his brain. I'm assuming that americans would like a leader with brains."
1,Shameless,"Really poorly written and constructed with zero reliance on fairness. Was this even vetted? Apparently not, since so many of the contentions have been rebuffed in the press. Even Dubya has said he does not believe John Kerry lied. So...what is the point of this book? Oh, yeah---a personal grudge. I'm as vindictive as the next son of a gun, truly I am, but this is taking things too far. Instead, invest your time in examining issues other than John Kerry's active Vietnam history. Like Bush's non-existent one, and how it got that way!"
1,BS4Bush,"All the republicans cannot face the truth in front of public found a way to put their lies in this book. And so call they are truth. It was failed on TV ads, and now it sneaks under Amazon.It is simple fact that Kerry went to the front line of Vietnam, but our dear dump ass commander in chief, Bush stayed as a national guard and hid under his father's cover. He neither had any guts during that time, or 911. Remember his scared face on the TV? How could such guy be the commander in chief of all forces? He even said we couldn't win the war on terrorist last week. Yet his wife had to correctly speak out for him...Wake the hell up! American!"
1,"Written by a liar, says AP.","""Presidential Elections - APSwift Boat Writer Lied on Cambodia ClaimWed Aug 25, 7:17 PM ET ""UPDATE:Navy Says Kerry's Service Awards OK'dSat Sep 18, 6:34 AM ETBy ROBERT BURNS, AP Military WriterWASHINGTON - The Navy's chief investigator concluded Friday that procedures were followed properly in the approval of Sen. John Kerry (news - web sites)'s Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart medals, according to an internal Navy memo."
1,Heidi Fleiss Meets Gomer Pyle,"This is a mong the most despicable acts of political cowardice ever displayed. In keping with this publisher's total disregard for veracity and gravitas, we are treated to a bitter exercise in political smear. Now we learn that the author of the book - who claims in the tome that he was never in Cambodia (a major count in the indictment against Kerry) - told Richard Nixon (who else?) in a taped conversation that he was indeed in Cambodia.It doesn't get any worse than this. Oh, but there is Anne Coulter. Never mind."
1,1 star because it was printed on nice paper,"At least Kerry went to Vietnam and voluntarily served unlike other people who shall remain nameless although his name begins with B and ends in H and there's a whole lotta s**t inbetween. Is this the best the Bush supporters can do? At least Kerry doesn't start wars! As was stated, ""Bush doesn't have a record to run on, he has one to run away from!"". After the release of this book, it was all proven to be false!"
1,Unfit to publish,"This is the type of disgusting political diatribe that shouldn't be able to find a publisher. Its conclusions first reporting are facts in search of truths which don't exist. This author is a bogus, fatuous tool of the right wing political machine that has put this country into seriously becoming a corporate facist state. Rather than publish him, he should be laughed out of town."
3,AD HOMINEM,"It must be the case that the folks who are mad at Amazon for suspending their ""no ad hominem attacks"" policy don't actually understand what that phrase means. The term ""ad hominem"" refers to the logical fallacy that because a person is of bad character his or her arguments are therefore invalid. In politics, a certain amount of ad hominem attacks are appropriate, as a candidate's character is arguably relevant to the issue of how good an officer holder he or she would be.Amazon did not state that they were allowing ad hominem attacks solely against the authors of ""Unfit for Command"" but allowing all such atacks in the discussion of the book. That has allowed many anti-Kerry folk to personally attack Sen. Kerry as a liar. In fact, isn't the premise of the book itself that Senator Kerry is ""Unfit to Command"" because of his character, not because he will make bad policy decisions. It would fruitless to have a discussion of this book under a prohibition of ad hominem attacks."
1,Unfit for publication,"Why hasn't this book been recalled, now that the President himself has said that Kerrey served honorably?"
1,Not Worth the Paper Written On,"You can easily tell this book is written from the perspective of a bias author with an axe to grind. Terribly disappointed because I thought this would tell me something of substance about a potential candidate. But it is so obviously written out of hate it's hard to get through the whole thing. If you're buying this book in hopes that it will help you to make an informed decision on who to vote for in the presidential election, don't waste your money! But, if you've already decided to vote for Bush and just want more rhetoric and garbage to agitate your pro-Kerry friends and co-workers with, it's probably what you're looking for. Take it from one of the ""undecided"" voters everyone is trying to persuade. I'm so glad I borrowed this book instead of purchased it."
5,Canceled my order,Just canceled my order. I'll buy this book from a local book store not from a vendor with such a obvious bias! It's time to hit these losers in the pocket book!
1,BEDWETTING CONSERVATIVES PLEASE NOTE...,"It's not enough that you're leaving Amazon.com. To make your protest real, you need to leave the country.Bon Voyage, Clodhoppers!"
1,john O'neill is 'unfit for publicity',"this work is not so much an untruthful assault on kerry's service as it is an assault on his post war beliefs and run for the presidency.if you liked this right wing propaganda, you may enjoy these other fine works: triumph of the will, the eternal jew, hannity and colmes."
1,What a raft of wank,"Hmm. So far....Two Bush staffers quit when their ties to these liars came out.Karl Rove is attached to the project.John McCain even decries it in disrespectful terms.The publishing company's website exposes a front for right wing conservatism, and doesn't even try to mask it.Can you say ""Govt. Endorsed Propaganda?""And all this vaccuous, unsupported venom spewed at a man who actually stood in combat...in support a man who got Daddy and his pals to shoo him off to a leasure suit position at a desk somewhere on this side of the ocean.Ack. Barnum was right, and the minutes are still ticking. And now thanks to Faux News, all the O'Lielly and Limp-aughhh Ditto heads are saying they'll boycott Amazon.....Well, I'm sure they will. Till the next book/CD/DVD they really want comes out. Then oh the pain the pain...and convenience will win out over conviction again and again, won't it? Hypocrites...."
1,Election Group Hypnosis,This work is turning out to obviously be the work of Bush supporters with an agenda and timing obviously motivated more by election interests than telling the truth.
5,"Beautiful music, great recording","Palestrina's masses are unlike those of Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart. While the big three's masses are filled power and emotion, Palestrina's masses are more spiritual and reverent. They have a certain restrained quality to them which does nothing to diminish their great beauty, but perhaps makes them more reverent. ""Otherworldly"" might be a good word for these masses.This is a wonderful recording - theperformances are first rate, and everything is quite clear."
5,Palestrina's Masses...I love them all...,"I don't think is a good idea to compare composersfrom three different musical periods; because oftheir different mentalities, different cultures,and different resources at their disposal...TheMissa Papae Marcelli is of interest because isone of the earliest works to challange the regulationsin music of the Counter-Reformation; but yet inother aspects it stays very close to what was expectedof Palestrina...Of special interest of theMissa Papae Marcelli is the Mass'Gloria....The Missa Aeterna...is a work that is basedon a motet a procedure that at the timewas a ""BIG NO, NO"" to the Counter-Reformationmovement...As all of the Palestrina Masses theseworks are all full of beauty and serenity...Oxford Camerata does a wonderful job...."
5,"The answers to life, the universe, and everything","This book is amazing. It explains, objectively, the sum of history, evolution, and possible futures. It is like reading cliff notes of the universe, blueprints of societal interaction. It is written brilliantly, yet easily accessable to the layperson. It should be required reading in schools, it is that good; it will awaken your mind and change your life."
1,Sophomoric rant,"I received this book in the mail, anonymously, a few years back and only read it now. Mr. Williams has set, perhaps, a new record for lack of depth in a printed work. He prides himself on knowing very little about a great many things, and, with his superficial knowledge, he feels somehow entitled to lecture the rest of us on creating a perfect world.Some call it a manifesto, but Williams fails to suggest any truly innovative solutions to anything. He seems often, in his numerous tangents, to be merely trying to show-off what he can remember off the top of his head-which is really not much. He oversimplifies everything-the line item veto will solve all of our problems-leaving the reader to wonder why he would think that his apparent business sense would translate into intellectual acumen. This book is a total waste of shelf space."
5,DELIGHTFUL LITTLE BOARD BOOK,"Five little pumpkins sitting on a gate.The first one said, ""Oh, my it's getting late!""The second one said, ""There are witches in the air.""The third one said, ""But we don't care.""The fourth one said, ""Let's run, let's run!""The fifth one said, ""Isn't Halloween fun?""Then Woooooo went the windAnd OUT went the lights.And five little pumpkins rolled out of sight.My 2 1/2 year old just loves Halloween. It's only June as I write this and he's already asking if Halloween is coming soon almost on a daily basis. So when I saw this book at a yard sale I just had to pick it up. This delightful verse that has been around so long is accompanied by cute and spooky illustrations of pumpkins, ghosts, witches, and black cats. Just a delightful and sturdy little board book. Perfect for your little goblin."
1,Does Not Work,"While I didn't expect a professional-level product for this price, I did expect it to do SOMETHING. It did absolutely NOTHING. Not even a tiny bit. I returned the product to Amazon."
3,Extra space - check,With a small apt this product really helps with saving space. I will definitely order similar products in the future!
5,G. Wilson Knight is BRILLIANT,"Knight's theories have become commonplaces. The idea that Hamlet is a bad guy? The theories the Duke of Measure for Measure and Timon of Athens are Christ figures? All those are propounded for (as far as I know) the first time in this eloquent book. Aside from having famous theories, Knight supports his claims, which at first can seem absurd, with mountains of evidence gathered from a fine-toothed reading of the text. He never makes obvious points or fallacious arguments; he starts out by noticing fine details in the text and then draws these into a coherent, convincing whole. I don't agree with every word he's ever written, but all his words are brilliant. Knight is the best literary critic I have ever read, by a wide margin, and this may be his best book."
3,Do they exist?,"This book is part of a Strange Science series and examines issues of the paranormal. The format of the text is presented in easy to read chunks that give a good deal of information without overwhelming the reader. Throughout the text, the author presents several examples of real life occurrences of ghostly sightings from as far back as the 1500s and examines the validity of their claims. Although it appears that the author is convinced of ghostly existences, she also argues that many times what others believe are ghosts are in fact natural occurrences such as a house settling or a rodent clambering in the walls. This is an interesting book that gives the reader several things to think about as they attempt to decide for themselves if they believe in this particular phenomenon."
3,Disappointed - would only buy a brand new one,"I wouldn't buy a refurbished model again. The bowl lifter is off kilter, causing the dough hook to knock the bowl out of its bracket when running. It works fine for mixing medium quantities of batter and cake doughs. On bread dough (which is what I bought it for) it can handle only about four cups of dough without the bowl jumping up and out. My 14 cup Cuisinart food processor with the plastic dough blade does a better job.For whipping less than a cup of heavy cream or beating less than four eggs, it's too big.I have worked with many different household and professional mixers during my culinary years. The tilt head ones give up pretty fast, but are cheap to replace. Large, commercial, Hobart floor models will take on any stiff or heavy dough mixtures.This one is a hybrid that doesn't stand up to my expactations."
5,Not a Scratch,"Ordered for girlfriend, the mixer came without any sign of use at all. Included the three mixer attachments, which appeared brand new, and book. Before you use the mixer be sure the bowl is pushed down and locked in the back of the stand (in addition to the two arm anchors) other the mixer will scrape and you will blemish your mixing attachments.Have not had much time to use it with recent travel, but so far it runs smooth and without any hesitation or rattling."
2,"A flop for Harold Ramis, Jack Black and Michael Cera","I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. I've loved Harold Ramis's work in the past. He's responsible for some of the funniest movies of all time. But he really blew it with this film. The jokes aren't funny and the plot is non-sensical. And rather than revel in the silliness, Jack Black and Michael Cera seem to be laboring through it. It wasn't a problem of acting as I felt Black, Cera and the rest of the all-star cast played it pretty straight. The issue was competely about the plot and dialogue and it rendered this a one time view at best. Rent it, don't buy it."
1,PATHETIC,"Embarrassing that a studio would even put a piece of garbage like this out. What a rip off to everyone who paid money to see it. Did anyone involved with this travesty actually read the script? There's not one funny moment in this so-called ""movie."" A class of sixth-graders with a $99 video camera could have made something funnier. And I'm sure the production values would have been better. I've seen better ""sets"" in high school drama club productions. Black and Cera (both usually good actors) stumble through their lame roles, but their characters suck and there's zero story for them to work with. A true embarrassment to all involved and any poor sucker who's had the misfortune of gritting their teeth through the mess of it all."
3,"Crude and often clumsy, but quite funny in spots","I am bemused by both the one-star and five-star reviews of this movie. It's certainly not a great movie, but it's not awful either. Yes, this territory has been covered before (think ""Life of Brian"") but for a broad, farcical comedy it's more than tolerable. The story line is paper-thin, but there are a lot of funny ""bits"" along the way. Oliver Platt does a great, over-the-top performance as the High Priest; Olivia Wilde is stunning as the Princess, and there are numerous amusing appearance by various comic actors. Worth renting if you like broad comedy and your expectations aren't too high."
5,Absolutely hilarious!,"Micheal Cera is great in this role. I'm cracking up right now thinking about him doing the jaguar dance. Grossly & undeservedly underrated. I saw it in the theatre and everyone was laughing their butts off! I bought the DVD and still am compelled to laugh. Also, Hank Azaria ""the lord THY GOD"" & Chris Mintz-Passe were also superb."
3,Okay...this is for a very specific audience!,"Watching this requires a ""specific audience""...that would be: those who are into history, have a DEGREE in history (guilty), are keen on pop-culture (again, guilty), and can refrain from comparing this to ""History of the World: Part I"" (why there was never a Part II, I'll never know). Anyway...this got pretty poor reviews, but I liked it (only based on my listed prior interests, though!)"
2,I wanted to love this movie because I was in it BUT.........,"I just COULDN'T!Just a brief review:I have first hand knowledge regarding this movie- so if people say ""consider the source"" I AM that source. To explain, I was an extra in this movie. Simply put-I was just in the background in several different scenes. From the ""stoning"" scene to the ""villge"" scene, I'm in the background doing whatever. Now, coming from someone that was on set several different times I can tell you I was HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED in this film. Shooting the movie was far more humorous that the movie itself. I typically like Jack Black's dry wit but something went very wrong in the story line here. Don't get me wrong; Black, Cera, Cook, etc. were friendly & nice. But that's really the only positive thing I can say about this movie. 2 stars were given simply because of the ""star factor"""
3,YEAR ONE GETS A HUGE BOOST FROM BLACK & CERA!,"I'm sure most folks didn't expect much from this silly caveman epic, but surprisingly it's not that bad. Jack Black and Michael Cera deserve most of the credit for keeping this one joke comedy from becoming stale. I really don't think this film would have worked without Black in the lead. Cera's dead pan delivery is also very funny and that caveman wig....is priceless.This film is going to appeal to fans of the two stars and probably not too many others. I liked it, but my expectations were low and I suggest you do the same before watching this juvenile but entertaining comedy. The film is full of potty humor and some nudity! Oh goodie! ;-b.....it sure needs it!"
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"I hate Jack Black! He is a talentless hack who babels on an on like a buffoon. I really have no idea why I wanted to see this horrible piece of cinema, but it's clearly one of the worst movies I've seen all year. The babbling is endless, the characters are whiny, and the plot of the movie is just stupid. I was kind of a hoping a dinosaur would come along and eat these two idiots! This is two hours of my life I wish I could have back."
1,to much swearing,"could not watch with kids, nacno libre is much better and you will get more laughs. ha ha ha ha"
1,"I never thought I'd say it, but this made Zohan look good.","Wow, Jack Black does his schtick as the ""crazy"" somewhat mentally-challenged doofus and Michael Cera does his as his nerdy sidekick... again. I do like stupid comedy as is proven by my love of most Jack Black and Will Ferrell movies, but this one just isn't funny. On any level. And cavemen (or hunter gatherers) dealing with civilization should be funny dammit. But a more purposeless movie would be harder to name and like most road trips in the real world, the journey gets really tedious after a short while. Cera and Black are dangerously close to wearing out their welcome and unless they find better vehicles... g g g g g goodbye!"
1,:0l ....stank!.... -0.1 star,I didnt know if i should look away or continue to watch this movie it was bad some ok moments but really wow these actors could have done much better it was all over the place I still dont know the PLOT of the movie.
1,SUUUhhhhCKK!,"This movie is an F-...click. It did NOT pass the friendship test.it's just a sea of mediocre lame time sensitive jokes that MAYBE evoke a chuckle.a BIG waste of money, jack should just focus on School of Rock 2 and writing more Tenacious D material.glad I got this free in a package deal with my Sony Bravia.This one goes in for sale or trade ASAP"
1,"Ordered HD thru TV service, got lower than SD quality","This is not a review of the movie as much as a review of the Amazon Video on Demand service available thru our hdtv. We rented this movie as advertised in HD, in the HD part of the catalog, but the picture quality was abysmal. It was less than SD by a long stretch; it was below web streaming quality. I have watched other Amazon Video on Demand HD TV shows, so, I know it is capable of HD, but this was not it.As to the movie itself, it was pretty lame. And it wasn't due to the video quality. Normally, when in the mood, I can laugh heartily at a funny Jack Black role, or an Apatow production. This just wasn't that funny. Also, the setting of randomly sewn together moments through history, kept distracting me from the movie and un-suspending my suspension of disbelief. The sappy, sincere turn at the end really didn't seem believable given the rest of the movie that came before it."
1,Just bad,"There were about 3 chuckle moments in the last third of the movie and that was it. When I see movies like this, I have to wonder what happens at the internal reviews and the test showings. Where did they get enough people who laughed at this train wreak and who decided it was good enough to produce, release and market.Bad, just bad."
1,Possibly the WORST Film Produced,"I absolutely adore Jack Black and Michael Cera, so when I saw a movie starring both, I got pretty excited.Boy, was I unprepared for the disappointment that followed putting it in the DVD player. I, somehow, was actually able to sit through the whole movie. I found it ridiculous, stupid, and offensive. I'm in NO-WAY a 'holier than thou' Christian. Most of the movies on my shelf would make most question if I really was a Christian, but I found this movie to be more offensive than anything I've ever watched before. I forgave the first couple of comments, but throughout the whole movie, all I saw was Bible bashing.I had expected a hilarious movie about a couple of cavemen trying to survive in the world. I'm not entirely sure of exactly what I got.The funniest part of the movie was the whole ""There's a snake on my foot?"" ordeal. And to most, telling someone there's something on your foot in the form of a question probably isn't really all that funny."
2,Black is the Shining Star,"YEAR ONE is a hard movie to watch. The only basis for it's comedic material is broad generalizations and stereotypes; many of which are lame and dull. If there is one good part of this movie, it is Jack Black. Once again, he manages to bring his own sense of humor and style into an otherwise dry movie.YEAR ONE is a mindless 'comedy', that should only be seen if want to intentionally see a bad movie."
1,"Terrible, even if you love Black and Cera","My wife and I saw this on vacation and she fell asleep halfway through while I stayed up to finish it, and I honestly envied her by the time the movie finishedThe script is total garbage, there are no funny jokes, the weird Biblical mishmash is both borderline offensive, nonsensical and not the least bit funny, and just all in all this is a total trainwreck of a movie.Not one good scene, not one good joke, nothing that happens that you could tell your friends about later and share a laugh over, just boring bad scene after boring bad sceneAvoid it, even if you can see it for free. Under no circumstances should you pay $30 to own it on Blu Ray"
2,"""Those Are The Only Two Jobs We Have Here"" ~ And What Job Is That, The Get-A-Check Job?","Why in the world would Michael Cera and Jack Black agree to make a film the likes of `Year One'? Okay Jack Black I understand, he's made quite a few of these nonsensical dudes like this in the past couple of years and doesn't seem to care one way or another. Michael Cera on the other hand has chosen his roles rather wisely for the most part, offering a little more than the lowbrow fart and pee on your friend type of humor his co-star has become famous for.Before ending I probably should try and come up with something positive to say about this turkey. Hmm..., the women are attractive."
3,Decent enough,"Year One finds director Harold Ramis returning to his more bawdy days of comedy, and like a previous reviewer already said, features Jack Black and Michael Cera doing the same things they've done for pretty much their entire careers. Black and Cera play Zed and Oh respectively, two pre-historic losers in the Biblical era, getting in all sorts of mischief that frequently involves genital and fart jokes. Along the way we see familiar comedic faces and Judd Apatow vets like David Cross, Paul Rudd, Hank Azaria, Bill Hader, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse; to go along with Vinnie Jones, Oliver Platt, Black's Tenacious D partner Kyle Gass, the ridiculously hot Olivia Wilde, and even Ramis himself. As a whole, Year One delivers a decent enough amount of laughs to warrant it worth viewing, but there isn't anything here that you haven't seen here plenty of times before, and seen done better either. Still, for Apatow fans and fans of Jack Black and Michael Cera, Year One is definitely worth seeing."
3,I wanted to love it but...,"I saw this on opening night because I had seen the previews and thought it was going to be really funny. I ended up very disappointed. There were some laughs but not many and I had seen them all in the previews. The storyline isn't that interesting, the romance is dull, the comedy is boring. So really all-in-all, not a great film."
2,Dumb Movie!,"I did not like this at ALL. I am also not a Jack Black Fan. I do not find him funny at all, and this movie was a total waste of time to watch. My husband and I both kept looking at eachother to see who was going to make it off the couch first to turn it off. But we kept giving it a chance, and sat through the entire movie.... I think we are dumber now having watched it. I do NOT recommend this stupid movie."
1,AWEFUL!! Sick and Stupid...totally retarded.,"This was the worst movie that I think I have ever wasted my time on...my husband & I couldn't even stand to watch longer than a half an hour...we kept waiting for it to get funny and/or good, but it never did. Totally immoral, sick and discusting. What a waste."
1,movie is bad,"Despite that I had a feeling that movie would suck, I gave it a go. Well, it was stupid. Acting was stupid, no real script, 2 morons just talking like they did not rehearse. Bad scenery, zero story. It was a waste of time. I like a good laugh but this was really stupid. I am glad I didn't spend $12 at the movies to watch this stupid. That's one of the reason I stay away from movie theaters. Even at one point they ripped the line from Monty Python's Life of Brian about not following the leader. Well, Life of Brian was a classic, this movie sucks. Just 2 idiots who don't really know what to do and they are on the camera."
1,YEAR ONE MOVIE,"I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED TO LEARN THAT THE MOVIE I WAS SUPOSSED TO RECEIVE WAS CHANGED TO A BLOCKBUSTER ONE AND POSSABLY SCRATCHED, ALSO I WAS ADVISED BUT NOT GIVEN ENOUGH TIME TO CANCEL PRODUCT.... I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS PROVIDER AGAIN!!!"
1,Bad movie,"This movie was basically a bad knock off of ""History of the World"". The only funny parts were basically what was in the previews."
1,This Movie Blowsssssss. Don't Waste Your Money.,This Movie Blowsssssss. Don't Waste Your Money. I went into the movies thinking this movie was going to be really funny. I was really let down. The low budget similiar movie Homo Erectus a.k.a. National Lampoon's The Stoned Age was much funnier. In this movie jack black eats crap literally and Michael Cera drinks urine literally. Jack Black jokes about banging his mom. I laughed a couple of times but this movie is really bad it should have been way better save your money and watch it on cable if you must. I would give this movie 0 stars out of 5 if I could.
3,year one,hard to get into. watched it with two other people and they liked it but had the same problem. funny but in a dumb way
5,it grows on ya,"honestly the 1st time I watched it I was like ya it was funny it was ok, but then 1 day i some how ended up with just the dvd, no box and so i watched it again and noticed all kinds of funny things I mist 1st time around. By now I have seen it like 20times and love this movie, id put it up there with joe dirt and buble boy, I also was never realy a fan of jack black but this movie changed that, "" Im peeing on my face too......on the inside"" lol if you didnt like this movie, try watching it again, it will grow on you, I think this movie was under rated and movies like superbad are a bit over rated but thats just me. Hope this helped"
1,"horrible, not funny at all",i kinda like jack black and saw the previews and thought this movie would be funny. However it wasnt funny at all and half way throught the movie i was wondering why i didnt laugh even once yet. I thought maybe i was missing something but at the end of the movie i realized it just suched. I finished the movie only becuase i was curious how it would end and i apparently had time to waste.
3,Only a Jack Black fan will like it.,"I have no idea hoe Jack Black is able to make movies that are mediocre in content. The only appeal is that Jack Black is very comedic and still entertaining. If you decide to watch this movie, you have to be in a special mood. Meaning there's nothing good on TV and this was lent to you for free. I hope others will add their review and prove me wrong. Hehehe."
1,Lame,Had much potential but they just had to mess it up somehow. Few jokes are actually funny other then that never lives up to any potential. Got this cheesy B rated feeling do not waste your time better movies are out then this thing. Just when it gets good and you think the movie starts to take off it hits bottom again and again. Unrated version is just extra nasty that is all.
3,Not what I'd hoped.,"I always expect great performances and recordings from Naxos, but this one didn't quite cut the mustard for me. The performances seemed oddly bloodless and mechanical, not sweet, passionate, lilting and mysterious. The recording quality didn't help, being distant and wan. I'm no expert on these works. I can't give you a critical rundown on other performances or recordings. But I can say that I can't believe there aren't more committed, better recorded performances out there."
3,Recording is good but not great.,In general the music is good. Bass is distorted. Sounds like it was recorded in a barrel. A good recording for the price level.
4,Great Music,"So many people did not either understand or know that the Eurythmics had been contracted to write the music that was supposed to be in the film release of Michael Radford's film 1984, but due to contractual problems in the US, the film was released without their music to the film. (It is my understanding that in the world wide release the music from this CD was on the film's soundtrack.) So many people who never read the book, yet were Eurythmics fans, could not understand how they, as a group, could create music that was not up to their regular standards (circa 1984). Not that I am a music snob by any means, but I think they did a great job conveying the feeling of George Orwell's phenomenal book, and Micheal Radford's vision of what music in that situation would sound like. Please read the book and listen to the soundtrack or watch the film with this soundtrack playing...I think that if you do not care for this CD now, it might change your mind!"
2,Soundtrack? Excuse me?,"Generally when a piece is refered to as a ""soundtrack"" it is assumed to contain a collection of or selections from the background score of a the movie in question. Whether it's hit songs, original music, or some combination, generally that musical score or collection is put together so one can listen to it verbatim without having the dialog and visuals in the way - the ""soundtrack"". But this simply isn't that.The CD says on it ""Music derived from Eurythmics' original score of the motion picture 1984"". That is accurate. It is derived from the original score, but it is NOT the original score. I've seen this CD for sale at several places and this ""direved from"" aspect is generally played down.It's alright. It's Eurythmics music. Eurythmics are good. But this isn't their best by any means. I was very disappointed to realize I still didn't have the actual ""musical score from the movie 1984"". A lot of the 'haunting' feeling from the 1984 music is just gone from this."
5,DoublePlusGood after All These Years,"I read the book. I saw the movie. I got this soundtrack and liked it almost immediately. And 26 years later ""I Did It Just the Same"" features prominently on one of my daily playlists. The whole album is brilliant but this song in particular is my favorite. Annie's vocals--it's like watching a huge butterly immerge from a tiny cocoon in 3 minutes and 29 seconds. There is total defiance by the end of the song. This is one album I'd love to hear played live in its entirety."
5,"My favorite ""album"" - Janis Ian's jazz is stirring","There are individual songs that I like a lot that Janis Ian performs on her other albums/CDs, but for a compilation of work Night Rains is my favorite. Night Rains is also the music score for a movie and that was the first time I heard it was when I watched the movie. Janis Ian has a quality that will be forever captured in time because of her recordings. My only sadness is that I never had the opportunity to hear and see Janis perform live during the 1970s and 1980s because her music was so much a part of my life then."
4,If you are interested,"This book was well organized. If you plan on visiting karachi or even have any ties to karachi, i recommend reading this book. It explains the history of Karachi and relates this to the modern situation of karachi. Its a great read if you plan on visiting this city; just so you have background."
4,Good Compact Reference,"This is a good guide for people new to recruiting and interviewing candidates for jobs. Although I like some of the other books in the series better, this one is filled with useful tips on the interviewing process, and emphasizes important areas such as preparation, active listening, shortlisting candidates, and asking good (and relevant) questions. The author also discusses some of the pitfalls (especially legal) of interviewing, which is extremely useful. I discounted the book one star for the illustrations, some of which are good, but several of which are confusing at best.The DK Essential Managers guides are an excellent and easily accessible resource, and I recommend them."
3,"Boring, but deffinetely not bias.","I'm a 12 year-old kid, who just happens to be Jewish. I respect all religions, as I hope most people do, and I read this book at school. There ARE two book series. One we read last year in 6th grade, mostly covered Christianity and Judaism, and only covered past events. I found it somewhat interesting. This book, however boring it may be to me, is deffinetely not bias. The book teaches students about Islam, while it is the teacher's choice on how to teach it. So, basically it would be the teacher's fault if it was taught wrong and not the books."
3,Book is great; confusing info,"As a student in seventh grade reading this book for history, I think this textbook gives confusing info to students like us. They use big vocabulary words and hard questions to answer that none of my classmates can answer. If you want an informative textbook, this one is the one for you. But otherwise, the textbook is very hard to understand."
3,Textbook with good information and waste,"When I was reading through the textbook, I found out that the book needed improvements. Every Chapter was divided into four parts: the information, a Green section(exploring, making decisions... a Literature section, and a chapter review. The information was Ok, but it should had been simplier. People who created the textbook tried to confuse kids with big words and jumbled facts. The Green section was a bunch of waste. the Literature section was the same. In fact, that section even confused me about the topic. The Chapter Review was made to help students prepare for tests. Someof the questions were helpful, but the Critical Thinking Questions were easy busy work. They asked you a question like, ""If you were a Roman living in the Roman empire, where would you live?"" I would recommend this textbook if you enjoy history or understand things easily."
1,Poorly written and confusing don't waste your money on this,"A poorly researched 558-page history propaganda that covers the millennium and a half between the fall of Rome and the French Revolution. About half of its eight sections are devoted to the West, and the other four deal with Islam, Africa, Asian empires, and pre-Columbian America. Warning the information in this book is innacurate. A waste of paper and money."
1,biased book,"Having looked over the information from an educators perspective, finding 200plus pages covering Islam and how to dress like a Muslim, what words to chant and the five fundamentals of Muslim, this book is very much biased to Muslim.I do not recommend this book to young minds as they would be misinformed in regards to the information past on from this book."
1,Tries to convert us to Islam!,"Not only is it a waste of resources, it is pretty much trying to convert us to Muslims! Nothing against that, but it's so cheap, no wonder so many people use it."
4,Great text book,This book is great it has the best information in it. It has information about a lot of diffrent things I think this is a great book Buy it
4,"No more tying, my shoes are now slip-ons.","I have been using these for a while now. They work in most shoes. I have used them in my Nike Free, New Balance Minimus Trail, New Balance MT101, and Merrell Trail Glove.The only shoe they haven't worked in is the New Balance Minimus Road. After I put the laces in my foot would slide around and the laces would strech and not hold my foot. Also, I don't use the end piece of plastic they give you because I think it looks horrible. I usually just tie a knot and tuck it under part of the laces.Overall I really like the product and would suggest it to all runners. Just make sure that it will work in your shoe."
5,Great laces,These work great. I have a hip problem that makes it impossible for me to tie a shoe. I play golf and very few models and sizes of golf shoes are slip on. These laces make it possible for me to wear a regular lace up golf shoe. I would highly recommend these laces.
5,Very Effective,"I bought these to replace my excessively long shoe laces in my New Balance Minimus shoes. I love the fact that these can be cut to your liking, although I ended up cutting mine a bit too short on my right shoe and it's a bit of a pain now. The laces use the locking mechanism to keep the laces tight and the other end pieces essentially lock the ends into a piece of plastic. You can also unlock the piece of plastic in case you need to adjust the laces like I've had to recently. Overall they work as promised and come in many different colors. Just wish they came in thicker styles."
4,Very nice for Adventure Races,Very handy for quick shoe changes.I got a second pair for my bum around the house sneakers as well.Love them!Andy
1,YUCK!,Very disappointing. I got these for my son who is 7 though still struggling with tying. We got them and put them right onto this shoes. By the end of the first week they were coming apart the laces were fraying... The clips that are suppose to hold the end of the laces did not stay on. He was coming home everyday with his shoes needing to be fixed and his soccer cleats fared no better. I have gone back to his regular laces. I had bought a pair for his basketc\ball shoes and have taken them off before the season even starts so I don't have to deal with them. They were not convient or helpful.
2,Not as good as Keen laces,"These laces work ok, but they are not as well thought out as the keen laces they were replacing. The mechanism is larger than it needs to be."
2,Frustrating to fit. Be careful.,"I followed the online instructions for these (i'd planned to use them for my running shoes), got what I thought was a good fit, snipped of the excess (as instructed) and went for a run. By the end of the run, it was clear that the laces were a bit too tight. But, as I'd followed the instructions and (foolishly) snipped off the excess lace material, I can't loosen them. $5 down the drain.So be warned: DON'T SNIP THE EXCESS LACE."
1,defective!,"I would have rated this product as I love it however, one of the snaps that you put at the end of the laces is defective. It is only half the size of the other snap that functions hence, it cannot be used. Now, I am stuck with laces that do not look nice, one has a snap, while the other one is just knotted to prevent the lock from slipping off.I can't believe it didn't undergo any quality assurance check before it was shipped out."
5,Great Laces,"After a Triathlon, 4.5 Mile race and daily wear, I can report that Lock Laces are great! They are as tight as you adjust them to be and they don't loosen during races or everyday use. I will continue to buy these for all of my shoes."
4,Fast and Easy,"I feel like I am always busy doing something so anything that saves time is appreciated. They come in nice colors. I am putting them on all my sneakers. So much better than tying and untying all the time. Bought two pairs for my golf shoes also. They are very easy to install, attached, unattach, and adjust.I think they could be priced a little cheaper though"
5,Love These,"I got these to replaced the regular laces on my duty shoes which are basically black sneakers. No matter what the laces would not stay tied. These new laces were easy to put on, although I did have to get a magnifying glass to see the pictures in the directions. I was able to leave a little extra on the length for any adjustments. I tucked the end of the laces under one of the straps so the little bead doesn't bounce around. Will probably order more of these."
5,Fast and comfortable,"The laces were exactly what I expected. I have been using them in my Wallabees for weeks now and they are great.The elastic laces give. Even though the shoe fits snugly it gives you room to stretch and move in a way normal cord laces don't.My shoes come on and off in a snap and I almost never have to adjust them. If I do, it only takes a few seconds.I plan to get many more of these and would recommend that everyone try at least one pair."
4,3 weeks and counting,These work as advertised. The Lock Laces although not exactly streamlined are quite comfortable once you get them adjusted. I just pull my shoe on and go. No shoes laces to tie or accidently untie.
4,I never thought laces could be so awesome,"These laces make putting on your shoes so quick and easy. The best feature is they completely cure lace pain. I use the get pain on the top of my foot from traditional laces all the time, but the fact that Lock Laces stretch completely cured the problem. The only negative is that the tips become frayed after you install and cut them; however the toggles mostly cover the frays. Also when running on a treadmill I can feel the lace locks bouncing and tapping the top of my foot. I think that is such an insignificant detail though.I would never own another pair of running shoes without these."
2,tied in knots,"These just didn't work out for me. Once you cut them and lock them, that's it. If they get dirty and need washing, too bad. I tried just using them as regular laces, but they were too long. Oh well, If they were black instead of white getting dirty wouldn't have mattered. Live and learn."
3,Bungee laces suck for running,I put these on a new set of running shoes before I even used the shoes. I have the shoes on the fist run. Even though the laces were too tight my foot moved around in the shoe and I got hot spots on my foot. I pulled the laces off as soon as I got home and put the original laces back on and tried them again. I love the shoes now. I put a second pair on another set of shoes I've been using and the laces turn a super nice pair of shoe into crap just like that. Bottom line I hated the bungee laces on my running shoes.
3,expensive for what they are.,they're a cool product but just buy one pair then make your own from the craft store. If they werent so expensive this would be an awesome product for kids shoes. I have them in my triathlon sneakers but wouldnt bother paying $7+ shipping for shoelaces for my other gym shoes.
5,Excellent Concept of Lock Laces,I am very happy to receive this product. I wear casual shoes to my office and the knot with my old laces never used to stay tight and used to come out so often. These Lock Laces helped me to solve a very big hassle. My old shoes with these new laces looks great and keep my foot in tact in the shoe and these days I have been using it like the slipons.
5,Very happy,"I put these on my autistic son's hiking boots several weeks ago and they have been working out great. Very easy to put on and use and the elastic band seems to be of good quality, very happy with the purchase and was willing to pay a little extra for better quality. Will surely be getting some more in the future."
4,Lace Locks do work,"These Lace Locks are the best of the 3 shoelace locking systems I have tried. They are easy to use and stay in place. You lace you shoes the normal way. Put your shoes on. Then insert the locks on the end of the laces. After that string the laces through the little cone leaving a few inches of laces at the end for adjustments. Cut of the any left over length of the laces. Tie them in a knot and put the knot in the cone and your set. They stay in place and you can slip you shoes on and off. Sometimes, the knot comes out of the cone, but the locks still keep laces in place.My only complaint is that I wanted white to match my white athletic shoes. When you order white in these, what you get is white with black that looks more like ZEBRA striped laces. I really just want SOLID WHITE, but they don't sell that."
4,Really convenient,"These are great!Just replace your regular laces with these and it makes the process of slipping on and off the sports shoes so simple.I especially like the fact that if I get a pebble or something in my shoe while running, its no bother to remove the shoe to take it out.Loved it."
2,don't cut too short,"I got these for my 8 year old because his laces never stay tied.I put these on his new shoes and we can't stretch them enough to get his foot into the shoe. I pulled them too tight before cutting. Just a thought... might want to do the first time ""lock lace"" of the shoe while it is on your foot."
2,purple pocadots,I wanted black laces of this type got pocadot gay. Shoe dyed them black however the dots come back.
1,WW scale review,"too difficult to program, have had 2 weeks and still have notbeen able to complete process, instructions stay on screentoo short a time, all i am able to get is weight, cannot seeother information on screen unless on floor and right on topof it, would send back but too much of a hassel and expense,too expensive for a scale that is only to give me my currentweight"
1,Do not buy I repeat Do not buy,This product is not good at all I had to return mine after only 2 weeks. I found out that it is really inaccurate and it doesn't work when you want it to. As for as the body fat percentage I couldn't even get it to work. Do not buy this product.
1,Windoes7 does not work,This Product does not work using windows 7 64bit!!The Download of this product went flawless. Amazon needs to place a note that it does not work for windows 7.
1,Save Your Money.,"Me and my friend kyle were so excited to play this game, we got it, and we shall never play it again.its a steep learning curve, they dont tell you how to get the chip, they dont even tell you how to fight!the graphics are glitchy as a windows 95 game.the sound is so fuzzy you dont know what the hell they are saying.the fun is not there, i wanted to get this game because of fun looking lets plays, but you actually get is a clunky game that doesnt tell you that there is a weapon in your inventory.and dont even get me started on how it ran, it wont run on my windows 98 so i have to run it on my stupid windows 7.but ill talk about fallout 2, this game is worse in every way but with indians.but i heard interplay stopped making fallout games after 2 and gave it to a new company, maybe they fixed it?i will review fallout 3. - Simon And Kyle"
4,"Good Game, few problems.","I am pritty familar with the Fallout games, and this one is the best although it has a few problems. The game starts off by you talking to the overseer of Vault 13 who tells you that the water purifying chip is dead and your the lucky bastard who has to get it......yay. The story is good although it is a short game (I once beat the game in under 20 min) and it dose have its fair share of glitches, one of the main giltches is when the screen goes black and you have to wipe it with your mouse and the F.M.V's get blury at times. For a game made in 1997 it is very big and has alot to offer (story and gameplay mostly) and it has about 20 to 30 different endings along with side quest and lovable characters, the thing I love most about this game is the vocie acting. Today is the last day on STEAM were they are selling it for 4.99$ so get it now. I give Fallout a 4 outa 5. This is Zombiedude sighing off."
3,4 good songs and that's it.,"If you're thinking that you're going to get an album that is full of songs like ""Every Little Kiss"", ""Mandolin Rain"", and ""the way it is"", like I did. Then you will be let down, Like I was. Those 3 songs have been favorites of mine since they came out, but I just now came around to getting the album. Sadly there is only one more song on the album that is even worth listening to and that's ""The Long Race"". These for songs have all the great piano work, all the great rythums, all the great vocals, and all the great songwriting. The rest of the album is very much just OK and I don't think a whole lot of thought was put into it.All in all though I payed 2 bucks for my copy and that is definetly worth it for 4 songs that I really like."
1,Only one good song,"I bought this cd hoping that it would be good, but the only good song on this entire album is 'the way it is.' I would not recommend purchasing this album because it only has one good song it."
5,Fruit of Superb Collaboration,"Bruce Hornsby's debut album is the first CD I have ever bought. It's been one of my top favorites for nearly two decades. I chose this CD probably from the #1 THE WAY IT IS starting from beautiful piano sound. Also this masterpiece work was directed by Huey Lewis. Also Bruce collaborated with Huey's big hits Jacob's Ladder in Fore album. Bruce Hornsby uses traditional musical instruments such as mandolin, harmonica quite well creating the local Virginia atmosphere. So they can well be compared with THE HOOTERS also the masters of traditional instruments. And their simple and acoustic rock style is really modern so VERTICAL HORIZON, TRAIN fans will surely love their music. Their music is so touching and homecoming you will love this album for the rest of your life.Recommended for wide varitery of American music fans young and old."
5,Bruce Hornsby and the Range tell you the way it is!,"Bruce Hornsby worked with Ambrosia shortly before the group disbanded for seven years. That's how he met Range bassist Joe Puerta. In 1986,four years after the temporary disbanding of Ambrosia,Hornsby,Puerta and the other three Range members(sorry,I don't remember all the names),recorded their debut THE WAY IT IS. It spawned three hits. They are the title track,MANDOLIN RAIN and EVERY LITTLE KISS. Huey Lewis sings background on DOWN THE ROAD TONIGHT. Many BH&TR fans are also fans of Ambrosia and Huey Lewis & the News."
2,Most songs are bland,"There are only two good songs. The song clips are misleadinging--they are not representative of the whole songs. Lyrically, most of them are ""love"" songs with little significance."
4,Old fan,"As in other occasions Bruce Hornsby, is the typical singer that i have like, but in radios where i have listen they usually dont say the name of the singer so i pass. Amazon makes possible to have name and music in one pack. Thanks."
5,A great choice...,I bought this cd for a friend and had a chance to listen to it.Definitely a great choice for a Hornsby fan or anyone who likes hisgreat piano skills. Great choice for listening on a long drive toanywhere. Love it....
5,Belongs to American History,"Some of these songs are part of ""Americana"". My favorite is definitely ""Every Little Kiss"", but some of the other ones are very excellent. Such a gifted song writer and keyboarder! I missed it when it first came out along with almost all ""popular"" music. Strange, huh? But, I found some of the great music..old music. While I was listening to Mozart Bruce was demonstrating his great gift."
4,Flavorful Adventure,"Bruce Hornsby and the Range are a musical anomaly. After winning the Best New Artist at the 1987 Grammy's (which can be a curse to some), one would have expected him to be a force to reckon with. However, during the 90's, he managed to make some good music but didn't get any more popular with the masses. This CD, his first, is a flavorful, melodic collection of upbeat songs, exploring social issues (""The Way It Is"") and romance (""Mandolin Rain""). The arrangements are tight and imaginative; the vocals are professional and suitable to the lyrics and tone of the compositions. Hornsby is an expert pianist, and he manages to infuse even his ""average"" songs with an inherent energy and obvious enjoyment of his work. Definitely worth a listen."
5,I still love it after 13 years,"This album debuted shortly after I began working at a small radio station in my hometown. When the single, ""The Way It Is"" began to get airplay, I fell in love with it. Bruce is obviously a talented musician AND a pop song with a social justice theme? Amazing! Mandolin Rain was even better; it's still my favorite Hornsby track. I own this album in vinyl, cassette, CD and I still listen to them often, even though radio is now part of my past. Another customer called this one of the best of the '80s; I couldn't agree more."
5,Primo Stuff!,"Why does this guy only have 3 albums?! Bruce Hornsby is an extremely talented singer & musician, but sadly he has a small body of work. This is the best of those few albums and it is time for MORE!"
4,Smart pop from the eighties,"Much like his mentor Huey Lewis, Bruce Hornsby was working a base of musically rich pop with acoustic flavorings. It fit right into the time, playing next to the likes of Don Henely, John Mellencamp and Lewis, and finds kindred spirits in current composers like Dave Matthews and David Gray. Hornsby is a pianist of considerable range and stately grace, which is showcased on the title track (one of this albums three massive hits).The themes of the album are a touch more mature than what was standard eighties pop -- again drawing the comparisons to Mellencamp and Henley. The socially astute title track in particular. There is also a southerner's perspective on living (""The Red Plains"" and ""Every Little Kiss"" being the best examples). While this remains Hornsby's most accessible album, that isn't to say you shouldn't explore more. By his third album, his jazzier tendencies made his albums less radio ready, but equally charming."
3,Good idea but with a design flaw,"This flash bracket is just the right size and price for a digital point-and-shoot or my Canon G9, but the ability to flip the flash for a portrait orientation is very important to me. The design flaw is in the method of changing from landscape to portrait (flipping the bracket). The pivoting mechanism is held in place with two machine screws and four small clear plastic washers to supposedly allow the bracket to pivot without loosening the screws. Unfortunately, the first unit I tried allowed the pivot screws to loosen whenever the bracket was flipped. That unit was returned for a replacement and so far (a few tries) the problem has not yet cropped up on the replacement, but I think it will. Keeping the screws from loosening with a thread cement might solve the problem."
4,economico y equilibrado,"Es un equipo de bajo costo, y acorde con esa filosofia resulta equilibrado en su uso. Recomendado para novatos que se inician en la fotografia o para profesional que no dispone de un amplio presupuesto."
2,Could've been better,"I couldn't get into this book all that much. All I kept thinking was ""blah, blah, blah"". I actually skipped sentences & paragraphs. The author spent quite a bit of time describing the surroundings (rooms, grounds, buildings, etc.) which I found to be boring. The dialogue was somewhat dull too. I can't even write an articulate review because I'm still half brain dead from reading the book. Compared to some of the other Harlequin books I've read, I found this one lacking and, BTW, I only ever write reviews when I find the book to be unlike what I thought it would be, based on other reviews."
4,Very Cute!!,"Very cute! Wore it on my wedding day and loved it! I'm by no means skinny and it kept sliding down my leg however, which was annoying. Other than the PSU fans running away during the garter toss- no complaints here! :)"
4,Nice when it works,"We liked the variety of alarm sounds, and the option to use vibrate plus alarm, although my 10 yr. old tried to avoid the alarms that sound like star wars battles, so he didn't wake up scared. The directions were helpful, and the chart that's included. Unfortunately, it started to work inconsistently after a couple weeks, and then at 3 weeks we couldn't get it to work at all. We emailed the company and they said they will send another easy clip sensor, which is where the problem was. I didn't clean it every night like I probably should have, but it doesn't seem like it should have broken that fast. My deep sleeping son often didn't wake up for the alarm, and at times he woke up enough to take it off and go back to sleep in the wet bed, so it's not a quick fix by any means."
2,Almost made it. But...,"This is a well made device. I took quite the beating while in use here with our two boys.We used this alarm for about a year total with both of our sons, unfortunately neither one had stopped wetting at night. The first (8year old) was getting to the point where he could make a night or two each week waking up dry in the morning after 9 months of continuous use. The telephone jack connector finally broke and by the time I got a replacement he had relapsed and became frustrated, not wanting to try any longer. So the younger (6 years old) said he was ready to try so try we did. After 3 months and no progress he refused to wear it any longer. I couldn't see forcing either of the boys, they are both real good about the problem and I didn't want to sour them on future attempts. I will say that this alarm/vibrator never waked either boy and it required them either to sleep with Mom and Dad or one of us sleeping with them. Good Luck!"
5,No more bedwetting~!,My daughter is 8 years old and has been wetting her bed every single night. So I think that it's time to do something and I've come across this product. There are other cheaper ones out there but it's not as good as this according the other reviews. Glad that I bought this even though it is very expensive. My daughter stopped wetting her bed in 2 weeks time.
4,Satisfied customer,"So far, so good. We were not sure what would work with our 10 year old grandson who has been bed wetting since birth. We have seen progress in the past two months and look forward to permanent dry nights ahead. The Malem alarm works well in waking the child, however, only if the child is willing to wake up and not reset the alarm. Well worth the money!"
1,Not effective,"The alarm is not loud. It does not wake up my 7 year old daughter. She moves in her bed and the alarm sound gets muffled under the blanket. So far, in the last 4 weeks, the alarm has woken my daughter only about 3 -4 times. I wish this alarm were louder. Also its bulky for anyone under 8 years old. Its kinda clunky.We have gone back to pullups. She will outgrow the problem someday."
2,Malem Ultimate isn't ultimate,"After reading numerous reviews, and getting this recomendation from our doctor, we decided to purchase this alarm. I was very excited about it and had high hopes for it. However, we had to replace the batteries twice a week- learned that the hard way- with a wet bed. And now the darn thing doesn't even work after having it less than a MONTH!! We decided to get the more exensive alarm because my child is a deep deep sleeper and thought 'if we are going to invest in this alarm might as well get the best one.' Yes, it did wake my child up. So I gave it 2 stars for when it was working. However, it's already broken. So lets hope we can replace this one and get another and try again or get our money back."
4,bedwetting alarm,Malem Ultimate Bedwetting Alarm - Blue 1 Tone w/VibrationThis item worked well. It wakes our son up the majority of the time. I thought it would be louder. We had planned to get up with our son but sometimes did not hear the alarm from our room on the same floor. It is a long process and we still aren't done.
2,Broken within 3 nights,"Product did its job for 3 nights. Despite concerns about the comfort of the clip/cable/shoulder pack, my child (a deep sleeper) awoke in time to get to the bathroom before any damage was done. But when trying to install it on the 4th night, the alarm sounded every time the sensor cable was attached. Both the alarm and sensor seem poorly/cheaply constructed--not what I expected for a $100+ moisture sensor. I'll be returning it and trying a different brand. I'm convinced the concept will work, but I don't think I got what I paid for."
1,No results after 3 months,"The idea seems good that someone (or something) would wake my son if he peed at night. However this isn't working. Granted that he has woken up a few nights, but that is about 4-5 times in the last 90 days. The last several weeks he has not responded to the alarm. We have been very patient and followed the advice of others who have used alarms in the past (with limited and mixed success). The problem is that it isn't loud. He moves around a lot and the sound gets muffled under the sheets.We have discontinued the alarm. 3 months was too long not to make progress."
5,Works Great!,"This product works great. It's so sensitive that it will go off with just a hint of moisture. Along with a moisture protection pad (like a crib protector), it worked great and saved lots of sheet washing!Purchasing from Amazon is the way to go - so quick and easy!"
5,Works as billed,Real life-saver working with a little boy who sleeps very hard. Like that the alarm varies the sound so he can't tune it out.
5,Wow! So glad we bought this model,"My son is almost 6. He WAS bedwetting most nights even if we restricted fluids AND woke him up around midnight to go potty. He was very excited about the potty alarm. I told him when it beeped to ""stop peeing"". The first night he woke up twice. Wet the first time, but immediately got up and he was smiling ear to ear saying 'it worked"". (in the past, he wouldn't wake up at all when he wet). The second time that night, he woke up and stopped himself. After the first night, he keeps getting better. We are on day 7 and he's had two dry nights in a row and has woken himself up twice without the alarm. On the second night he said ""I love this thing"". It makes him so happy that he is getting better. No kid wets the bed on purpose. Try it...nothing to lose. Talk it up before it gets there so they are excited when the box comes. I told him he was getting a cool alarm that would tell him when to go potty...he was ready with just that. It is shipping fast."
5,Best Money EVER Spent!!!!!!,"I absolutely love this product!! It was well worth the money spent! I have 10 year old twin boys that have never been dry a day in their life. They recently asked when the bed wetting would stop. I starting researching different products and found the Malem Alarm on Amazon. I spent a lot of time reading all the reviews. I was hesitant to try it because I was afraid it wouldn't work for us, but decided to go ahead and make the purchase. I basically followed all the rules in the manual. It takes some work on your end, but well worth the time put into this. At first, we used the alarm and wore pull-ups on top of the underpants. This made it easier for me at night so I wouldn't have to strip the bed. I was amazed at how this worked for both boys! We trained one twin, then started the second one. Once in awhile they have an accident, but not too often. They both have been basically dry for a few months now! DEFINITELY BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"
2,Not using,"My son is not using because he did not realize he had to wear ""NORMAL"" undies instead of boxers. My son is older so it would probably work better for a kid that is younger than 12."
1,"Very difficult to program, poor performance","The beeping part comes with a plastic stick and an array of buttons to program. You have to be a genius/scientist to get it all figured out. You will have to open the unit and use the stick to change the music.We lost the stick, so now we are having difficulty with the product. Anyway, the product is not working even after 3 weeks. We have broken the easy clip and had to pay for replacements which in my opinion are not worth it.I was waking up 3 times a night and cleaning the sensor with a toothbrush as recommended. In one week, it's all rusty and potentially dangerous. Nope, this isn't going to work for us."
1,Doesnt wake up my son,"Ive tried and tried to use the malem alarm but have had no luck. My son just won't wake up to the alarm. No matter what. I had some issues with the sensor clip breaking after attaching and removing it from the underwear. I purchased a spare clip, but the same thing happened. I could keep buying replacement sensor's, but what worries me is that the malem will not wake him up. It's been about 2 months now. I think its time to quit."
2,Not what I had hoped for,I don't blame the device entirely....we are a family on sleep meds - and taking those and waking to an alarm every few hours does NOT mix. We stopped using it after two weeks. Never made a lot of progress. Darn. I think it would be a good product if we weren't on such sedating sleep meds.
3,SAVIOUR OF THE SOUL 2 - NOT A SEQUEL,"This has someting for everyone, contemporary action, fantasy swordplay (by Corey Yuen Kwai), romance and a happy ending. Adventurer Andy Lau, his godson and mad professor colleague go on a quest and meet Rosamund Kwan, Andy's long term dream lover. Unfortunately Andy's character dies so Rosamund gives him the only thing which is keeping her alive and thus saves him. She then begins to shrivel and grow old. Of course our gallant hero is prepared to sacrifice his own life for the woman he loves. Unfortunately it can only keep 1 person alive at any one time.Who will live? Who will die? Will the devil who also wants the secret steal it? Watch and see. The only thing wrong with this movie is the title - very misleading"
3,Good suggestions and ideas.,"There are a few good ideas in this books, but you have to actually want to do these things. This is a typical self help book were a lot of people think their problems can be solved just by reading it. A lot of the tips are easier said than done. Yes, it's easy to think about kissing your mate for 10 seconds, but how many times do you actually do that? Ellen Kreidman gives a lot of great examples on how to improve your relationships. But you still have to work at it yourself. Not a bad book."
5,This Book Is Really Magic,It changed my 14 year marriage into a love affair over night. Ellen makes it so easy to understand how to change your relationship from being predictable and boring to spontaneous and exciting. The thing is that she makes it so easy. Other authors make you think that having a great relationship is so complicated and impossible to have. Well this book is being given to everyone I know and people I don't know if I ever hear anyone complain about their relationship again.
2,It was ok.....,"I read this book in my RLA class in 8th grade. I think the book was ok. But i didnt like the story that much. I would recamend the short story ""The kid nobody could haned"" that book was a very good book!"
5,More than a bargain,"This is a handsomely played and beautifully recorded disc. The Rose Consort of Viols aptly catches the inherent melancholy of Gibbons style while Tessa Bonner sings ethereally as usual. With singing of Bonner's purity, as in ""Silver Swanne"", who needs texts? This is more than a bargain; it is a wonderful introduction to the deeply touching music of Orlando Gibbons."
3,Okay but no texts,"As the title says mainly viol consort and keyboard music, but the highlights are the two english anthems for 5 voices, and three solo pieces with Tessa Bonner - including the famous ""The Silver Swan"". So why no texts? Playing time 68'24""."
5,Stupid cliffhangers!,"I've read the entire Shannara series since I was introduced to The Sword of Shannara two years ago, in high school. I read the last book in the series, Isle Witch, last year. Luckily for me, Antrax was released about a week after I finished it.I just finished this book last night, and I cursed Terry Brooks and his evil, evil tendency to write cliffhangers. He gave me four or five different cruel cliffhangers to chew on, and I felt ready to destroy something! I HAVE to know how this ends!! I eagerly await the release of Morgawr in September.The book was very absorbing, just like the rest of the Brook's books, and I found it very easy using my imagination to imagine the world they were in. That's the nice thing about Terry Brook's writing - he's so descriptive.Long live the Sword of Shannara!"
4,"One of the Best, Most Original Fantasy Novels.","Remember that Reese's commercial from the 70s .. Hey, you got your peanut butter on my chocolate, you got your chocolate on my peanut butter ... Yes that sums up this book. Midway through another fantasy novel, a genre I am comfortable with, where little can surprise me. Out of nowhere comes a maniacal supercomputer hell bent on world domination, a matrix style battery system, and cyborgs. THIS ISN'T A FANTASY NOVEL! This is a Sci Fi novel ... no wait its both. Actually the introduction of the techno aspect was a nice refreshing change. It gave the whole Shanarra series a planet of the apes feel. I felt the book was , as with all shannara novels I have read, far more intense than the average fantasy fair. Main characters often die, the violence is intense and the situation is hopeless."
4,"Good, but not great","I would agree with the reviewer who called this book ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of this series. It was definately the darkest of the Shannara novels, more so than ""The Druid of Shannara."" I thought ""Ilse Witch"" was great, but this book dragged on a bit too much for me, and the ending was a let-down; however, I am looking forward to the final book. It looks as if some of the ideas I've had about the ""Great War"" and the ""Old World"" since the ""Sword of Shannara"" may turn out to be on the mark. I would say that after this book, Mr. Brooks should turn his considerable talents to new worlds and ideas. Shannara may be reaching its limits."
4,Only one Problem,"The only problem with Terry Brook's latest hit - the next book in the series isn't available. I haven't read a Brooks book in some time, and well - it was refreshing to see that he continues to turn out wonderful works."
5,Geat book,i felt this book kept the shannara world going. it was well written with vivid descriptions.
2,Lightweight and overstretched,"Terry Brooks hit his stride a long time ago and has been limping along ever since. The early Shannara books were just plain awful Tolkien ripoffs, though the middle parts of the saga, notably Elfstones of Shannara, were actually quite good. But this post period is pathetic.Admittedly, Brooks has moved away a little from stolen elves and dwarves and into new types of characters, but his writing is still very stilted and not all that engaging. There is an oily sheen to his work, a career made out of capitalizing on other people's ideas and pathfinding and movie tie-ins. This particular book is not hard to read, but I found it hard to like."
2,"Better than Ilse Witch, but that's not saying much","This book didn't feel like one long prologue like Ilse Witch, but it has the same problems that plague most of his books in the last 10 years: Predictable and never changing from the status quo. Terry didn't have much of a story to fill an entire book so there isn't a lot of action until the end and the characters spend page after page thinking. Oh I wish Bek was here? I wonder what secrets Walker is keeping from us. If only I had the elfstones? She's my sister! and so on and so on. One of the chapters ends on a cliff hanger with two characters deciding to face the Terminater/Borg monster that is chasing them. So I'm thinking, finally they'll be action in the next chapter that is devoted to this part of the plot. I was wrong. Another whole chapter is devoted to the two characters thinking and talking before finally facing the monster. Let's hope the 3rd book is better."
2,Infuriating Ending,"They struggled through all that terrible danger--for *what*?Their intended treasure--crashed. The company--scattered. Hopefully, things are tied up and explained in Morgawr."
2,Engrossing but Predictable,Guess what.... it's another Terry Brooks book from the world of Shannara. All of the interesting stuff about how the world has changed showed up in the first book. What's left is a boring middle of the series book where nothing really happens that hasn't happened in one of his previous trilogies.
2,Sci-fi annulled fantasy in Antrax,"Ironically, what a way to destroy the generations of fantasy realms created in the world of Shannara. Although Terry Brooks writing talent is as compelling as ever, Brooks' emphasis on too much science fiction, like the introduction of artificial intelligence, supercomputers, laser-wielding robots and so on in ""Antrax"", has nulled my hopes that what Brooks is trying to bring to us in the Voyage of the Jerle Shannara trilogy is any fantastic fantasy concepts or elements. Shannara series is engrained in my mind as pure realms of fantasy and because of what Brooks did with ""Antrax,"" my sentimental attachment to the Shannara realms has been shattered and turned upside down. With ""Antrax"", Brooks has destroyed that pure fantasy world of Shannara which I had loved so dearly. Needless to say, I won't be looking forward to the third installment ""Morgawr."" If I want to read science fiction, I'm sure I can find a host of other books to choose from."
5,"Antrax (The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, Book 2)",After waiting three weeks for the book to arrive I could not believe how fast I read it. I could not put it down. Once again Terry Brooks had me hanging on the edge waiting to see what happened next. The only thing that is driving me crazy is waiting for the 3rd book! I can not wait to read the outcome.
4,Better than the First,"I am a big fan of Terry Brooks. I find his writing easy to read and quite enjoyable. I have always been a BIG Terry Brooks fan,so I had to read the heritage of Shannara series.The first book Isle Witch I thought was quite disappointing until the very end. Immediatly I went out and bought the second book. I thought it was so much better then the first. I loved the Character development,I think that is one of Brooks best qualities in his books. When a character died,It was done so well and so emotional it almost made me want to cry.at the moment I am reading the third book Morgawr and it is very impressive so far.If your a Terry Brooks fan I recommend this book. I couldn't put it down."
5,An Amazing Continuation,"I thought that Ilse Witch was good. I thought that Antrax was amazing!Terry Brooks has somewhat reverted to his original writing style used through most of the Shannara books, and I say that's a bad move. But, there's so much action, and so many surprising plot twists, that they completely make up for Brooks' style.Characters-5 out of 5. If anything, they've gotten better than in Ilse Witch. Truls Rohk, the Ilse Witch, and Walker continue to be the best out of a fine cast of characters including Bek Ohmsford, Ahren Elessedil, Ryer Ord Star, and Quentin Leah (amazing! He doesn't annoy me enough to slam the book shut for a while, as most Leahs do, with their ""I've got to protect and fall in love with girls"" attitude).Storyline/Plot: 5 out of 5. Action-packed. There's so many plot twists I can't tell you much of the plot without giving it away.Overall: 5 out of 5. Great book, worth buying!"
5,My favorite Shannara Book,"This is my favorite Shannara book. I just love Antrax! The Wronk is absolutely fantastic! So creepy! If you've made it this far in the series, there is no turning back. Enjoy!"
4,Reads like the end of the series but its only the 2nd book,"This is the second book in the Jerle Shannara series. It reads alot like the conclusion to the second book, though not as rushed as the first. The druid and company make it to Antrax and its mystery is revealed.More of the relationship between Walker, Bek and the Isle Witch is also explored. I also like the way technology is continued to be played out in this series. I give the book a B."
4,Best of this series,"While pieces of this book are a bit too predictable, it is one of the better works in this series. The blending of science and magic hints that Terry Brooks is going to head somewhere completely unpredictable when he extends his franchise beyond this series.The story deals with the continuing voyage of the Jerle Shannara, which has traveled the Blue Divide to the land of Parkasia. Within the walls of Castledown, the party must find a way to defeat the being known as Antrax.With the build up of the series out of the way, this book deals more with the twists and turns that make Terry Brooks one of the finest Fantasy writers of our generation. While the overall outcomes of the story follows the traditional hero's journey, who survives and the means of solving the puzzles require turning a lot of pages.Antrax is a very compelling story, which is likely to keep you up for at least one or two nights, anxiously awaiting the outcome."
2,Worst Shannara Book ever,"I have been reading the Shannara series faithfully for 10 years, and I have never been disappointed with a Shannara novel until now. The book lacked any form of character development and was seemingly devoid of any advancement in the story until the last 50 pages when it is too late. I have been hoping for a character to emerge and capture my heart in this series, but none have. There is no Balinor, no Garet Jax, no powerful Leah, Quinten is a huge disappointment.I will buy Morgawr only because I am dedicated fan--I only hope that the next book, the conclusion, will not leave me disappointed with the series."
4,Thrilling,"Just finished the book.The ending bites...you've got to read it!The book is full of thrills and twist and turns. Sword and sorcery,politics, trickery, intrigue, fights, swashbuckling, love, hate...Wonderful storytelling and complicated plot and character relations. if you've read the previous book, Truls Rhok is Revealed!...gotta read it."
3,Something Missing?,"Perhaps I am just getting older but the Shannara series has lost a lot of its previous magic... It seems almost like each release is a technical example of good writing as opposed to a good piece of fiction. Tie that into the repeating theme: One Druid, Two Boys, Everyone discovering super magical powers/legacies that they never knew they had... The best comparison I can think of would be the old kids show ""Mighty Morphing Power Rangers"". Yes there are different battlegrounds and monsters, but the story always followed the same path ending up in the super-mega-good-guy that always one. If the Shannara series is to continue, perhaps a little life needs to be blown back into the base plot."
2,Not necessarily for every family,"This book, while I'm sure it is considered charming by some, is not necessarily right for every family. It certainly wasn't right for mine.If you are trying to teach your children to use the correct names for parts of the body rather than slang terms--this is probably not the book for you. If you don't think that it is appropriate for children to notice or comment on (let alone joke about) the size of their mother's undergarments--this is definitely not the book for you.I don't usually consider myself stodgy, but I thought the way Baby on Board handled the issues it discussed was totally over-the-top and inappropriate."
4,It's really not that bad,"So sure some of the language in the book might be questionable, but really it tries to go about it from a kids perspective. Kids will notice mommy buying bigger bras, and panties and shirts and pants while pregnant. They will also notice that you go and pee every five minutes when you are at the mall, so i do not blame the book for commenting on it. I really enjoyed reading this to my daughter and I changed some words around if I did not want to say them, but my daughter thought the pictures were hilarious and she also liked to be able to have something to reference ""her baby's"" size to ( a piece of gum, an action figure, biffo's dinner"" We've have read it probably 100 times already and unlike the ""accurate accounts"" of what pregnancy is she has really been able to relate to this..."
5,magnifica,"esta novela, que da la sensacion de claustrofobia y terror provocada por una enfermedad que pone en cuarentena a toda la poblacion, es otro logro de albert camus, un tremendo escritor, autor de ese otro libro llamado el extranjero. la peste, de caracter menos nihilista, nos muestra a los seres humanos aislados por la enfermedad y en busca de una causa comun, pero siempre solos, con su interior muy buena... LUIS MENDEZ"
5,Excellent!!!!,JE SUIS VRAIMENT CONTENTE! so happy that the book came earlier than the expected arrival time! I am this much closer to learning the french language =D awesome thank u!!!!
4,Byrd: Mass for Four Voices; Mass for Five Voices; Infelix ego,I was not familiar with Byrd's nusic until I heard it over the radio.I was pleasingly surprised by it's beauty RECOMMENDED
3,This work is good but misses the mark,"I found this book to be filled with facts about porn and women over the past three or so decades, however, it left me rather cold as to it's approach to the reader. I did not feel involved with the contents. It read more like a dictionary or encyclopedia than an expose or display on sex and porn and women. I found the amount of research to be adequate and all, but I just did not feel a part of what the author was trying to accomplish. I felt rather distant and cold to an issue which has been hotly debated since the begining of time. The book is interesting and well written, but not passionate by any standard. It certainly does not use flair, or even wry comedy to bring home it's points. It chooses to acomplish it's goals by just giving you the facts and nothing but the facts, madam. I may be looking at this issue from a male standpoint but after reading Woman, an intimate geography(which was fantastic), this left me a little cold."
3,Bosun's Pipe,"The item arrived in good condition, with a quick arrival after order placed and paid for and was exactly as described and as in photos.For practical use it did require some modification, which the recipient was able to do; I hadn't asked if it was mainly for decorative purposes which it seemed to be but nevertheless we were quite happy with it.All visitors now get ""Piped Aboard"" as they enter the house!"
2,Silver Plated British Boatswain's Pipe with Chain,"Arrived on time and looks nice, but appears to be cheaply made. Does not function well as a Bosun's Pipe, but it looks good as a novelty item."
2,Not up to par.,"Text is informative, but the black and white photographs do not depict the procedures distinctly. In addition the text does not seem to be too comprehensive."
1,Not informative or sexy...,"The book does not give enough actual advice or instruction on massage itself. It seems to focus more on the idea of intimacy, which can't be learned from a book anyway. The photos were distracting and not useful for technique at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I paid $4 for it and that was way too much."
5,The Passing of The Night,"Fantastic book written by my good friend, Gen. Robinson Risner. A book about the sustaining grace of God and the courage of the American serviceman. Good and greatness can never be defeated. Inspiring reading!!!"
3,A Review Form A Good Reader,"""The Memories of Anne Frank"" is a good book. Becauseit describes her life well. It is about Anne, of course, and herchildren, based on her friends. It really doesn't have a lot of speaking parts like a regular book would. When the book describes it, it is in very good detail. In my point of view, this is a good book if you want to know what happened specifically to Anne Frank during the war. END"
3,About the Book,"I read the book Memories of Anne Frank by Alison Leslie Gold as an assignment for school. I usually like to read but this book was very average but I am definitely not saying that this book is not a good one. Its just really is not style of book. The book was focused mainly on Anne Frank's childhood friend Hannah Goslar and Hannah's family. The book was not very factual, it did not give many important dates, and it stayed mostly from one point of view. The story was mostly based around memories that Hannah had of Anne's and her childhood friendship and the families friendship when thing were all fine and before the Nazi people came. The book I would probably recommend this book to a girl over a boy because the main character, Hannah, is a girl and boy and girls interpret thing differently most times. Mainly I did enjoy the book but it was not one of the best books I ever read."
1,This blacklight sucks,"The specs say it covers 7200 square ft, it barely covers that and is so dim that you can't tell that it does anything. Also it broke after 2 days and was barely used in those two days. Do not buy this product!"
5,The last and Final Magical DVD,"Li is going through a troubling time trying to confess his feelings to Sakura, while Eriol is causing messy big honking havic !! With Sakura on the job trying to get the last cards, and Li chasing after her with his heart pounding ! The Final Battle has just begun !!!"
5,Go to Ebay for episodes 1-70!,Ok this is a great dvd but what im sayin is that you can get a better deal on ebay. I did looked it up on ebay and saw that you can get episodes 1-70 on ebay for good deals. So if you want all the episdoes for good deals go to www.Ebay.Com they'll make your Anime dreams come true....
5,Architecture and Berlin's Identity Crisis,"Am reading The Ghosts of Berlin in anticipation of a trip there this coming summer. Great book for those interested in how the architecture of Berlin is the manifestation of the city's identity crisis. How does a city, its inhabitants, its government and the architects who design for it hide or reveal or inform their turbulent history and future hopes? This book provides an insightful view into the urban landscape of Berlin circa 1997: ""German architecture and urban design cannot escape the crisis of German national identity...A building or monument might be able to display the wounds of Berlin's past, but it can do little to heal or even hide them."""
3,"Busts noise, but has drawbacks.","This headset with Active Noise Control seems to do a great job at knocking out the noise. The noise cancellation clearly works. The headset clearly has drawbacks that explain why this model isn't more popular.The unit has box in the cord containing the batteries and electronics that you must hold or clip somewhere. I tried it with my cell phone and with a cordless phone I have at home. With both phones the volume was too soft. Loud enough to hear, especially with the noise-reduction turned on, but not loud enough for clearest hearing. Finally, the radio signals coming from the cell phone audibly interfere with the sound coming into the headphone. Therefore, while I might use it with a corded or cordless phone, I would avoid using this headset with a mobile phone.For this price though, you can't go too wrong."
4,Decent product for the price,"Bought this product and within the first hour in the pool, one of the locking tabs broke off the top! However, other than no longer being childproof, this is a product that works as promised. I fit five 3"" chlorine tablets in it without an issue. Rotate the bottom easily to adjust how much is delivered and drop it in the pool. The tab broke when it accidentally got flipped over when people were fooling around and tried tossing it out of the way. However, everything including the cover floats and we've had no problems with it yet otherwise. Would definitely purchase again if needed or recommend to others."
5,FLOATING CHLOR. TAD. DISPENCER FOR POOLS,"IF YOU NEED SOMETHING TO PUT YOUR CHLORINE INTO HERE IT IS ITS BIG ENOUGH FOR THE 3INCH.TABS IT WORKS GREAT IN MY ABOVE GROUND POOL.IF YOU NEED ONE GET THIS ONE,YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID. I HAD ONE FOR OVER 12YRS TIL NOW AND I JUST NOW HAD TO GET A NEW ONE THEY LAST FOR YRS."
3,Not the best,"Just ok, not the best. It's larger than the ones I had, but no more capacity. The cap is also not as easy to close."
3,Chlorine tab holder is OK- not great,"Holds 3 inch chlorine tabs and floats. Top cap not well designed and easily falls off with a bit of movement of the dispenser. Widest opening of sliding control on the bottom still allows insufficient flow- I had to cut out a few of the white crossbars. No flange to attach to tether. I had to put a stainless steel screw into bottom to attach a nylon fish line, or the dispenser gravitates to skimmer."
2,Not recommended for spas,"I bought this for a 7' hot tub (mid-large tub). The adjustment mechanism on the bottom is not effective to control concentration in a spa. Specifically, I have reduced to 1 chlorine tablet in the floater and completely closed the vents yet my chlorine concentration goes high. This is a large floater. I'm sure it's fine for a pool but it's advertised as a 'pool and spa' floater which is why I bought it. I cannot recommend this for spas."
1,sinking feeling,"Of all the things you expect a floating chlorinator to do, float is right up there on top of the list and this unit refuses to fulfill that aspect of its product description. The blue collar at the top filled with water and now it lists along with only one edge peeping above the waterline. It hasn't sunk completely, so it is fulfilling the other half of its destiny, it still treads water filled with three tabs, but not in a pleasing, ship-shape manner any longer."
3,Lasted just one year,"Not bad, but I would have liked this to last longer than just one year. Works as intended, but the plastic sort of disintigrated."
2,Breaks down in the Arizona sun,I've seen floaters with their color washed out but this one the plastic disintegrated. Perhaps it would be better for an indoor pool or in Seattle.
2,Floating dispenser,I bought this for a spa and filled like it said. THIS IS TOOOOOOO BIG FOR A SPA. IT BOUT KNOCKED ME OUT WITH THE FUMES ND BLEACH THE LINER TO THE PORTBLE SPA. I'M NEW AT THIS SPA THING AND DIN NOT KNOW. SHOULD MORE SPECIFIC.I WILL READ MORE CARFULLY
2,Not the best,"Looks good and sturdy but top pops of easily, even when in lock position. Wouldn't recommend for use when people in pool as a big 3 inch tablet may find itself on the bottom of your pool and ruin your liner."
3,so far so good,"It's a light weight Floating Tablet Dispenser. It doesn't look very durable, but so far I haven't got any problem with it. I hope it will last more than a year."
5,does the job,Well it does exactly what it is supposed to do. Cannot give it less than five stars. Gets the job done.
2,Air reservoir eventually filled up with water after 4 months...,"Air reservoir filled up with water after 4 months, causing the dispenser to float sideways, and eventually sank.After reading the reviews, I was expecting this to last at least a year. I guess I was wrong. Won't buy this brand ever again."
3,It works,"I got this for our 30,000 gallon pool, even all the way open it doesn't quite put out chlorine quick enough for the pool, but putting the chlorine in the skimmer is too quick. So I settled on cutting the slits in this bigger(with a box cutter) to make it go quicker than then I add some chlorine to the skimmer basket every other week.I also use this in the hot tub in the winter, probably because I cut the slits bigger it lets chlorine out too fast even closed all the way with only one tablet. So I alternate having the dispenser in or out every two days."
3,Just Plastic ... Not Clay,Just FYI. It is made nicely but it was not what I expected...plastic. It seems durable for what it is. I don't understand why they sell it separately from the flower box when it is just plastic??? So it is kind of deceiving.
1,Worst Product,This is not compatible with Sony Ericsson.My friend used it with Razor v3 and after a week this stopped working.*** Dont buy this ***
1,did not come close to meeting my expectations,"The headset was used with dirty earpiece. Then the head set would not sync with my Iphone. Very disappointed. I expected a new item, not a used item that was badly in need of cleaning."
2,Connection is an issue,Connectivity is an issue. Voice breaks. Many call drops. Batter life is an issue too. Please read other reviews too.
1,Very disappointed,"This product was a huge disappointment, very uncomfortable, does not hold a charge for long and trying to turn it on and off was a huge headache."
2,not a long term solution,I have this product for a few months it worked great.... but after that it stopped working... had to go for a nokia and thats much better in terms of distance frm phone or clarity in reception...I wont call this product worth a purchase.
2,"OK, but not good",Product is an old model and has flaws with sound quality both at the headset and transmitted to the other side. Feels fairly flimsy. You can get comparably priced headsets with much better quality nowadays.
2,Be Careful,"This is the older bluetooth and will not stay connected to your phone, I purchased 2 of them and had to send back to Motorla for the new C model. These are the older A models and according to Motorola they did not pass any beta testing prior to being released. The sound quality was ok but after disconnecting the bluetooth it would not reconnect to the phone."
4,A LOT SAFER NOW BEHIND THE WHEEL...,"WITH THE RABATE I GOT WITH THIS, YOU CAN NOT BEAT THE DEAL OF $12.99...MAY NOT BE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY BUT, IT WORKS A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN HAVING A WIRE! THANKS!"
2,not a very good unit,"I bought this to replace a 320Plantronics that had a broken earpiece (!?)I don't mistreat by stuff, but I'm at a loss to explain the broken earpiece.Anyway, Amazon had these on sale so I bought one.Sorry I did, too.This unit is totally uncomfortable, the sound quality is poor and the connectivity is awful.Granted, the first gen Razr that I have does have it's own connectivity issues, but this thing is junk. It will hook up for a little while, but I never know for how long."
3,Could be better,"1. Good receieve sound, but the person on other sides usually complains of low sound.2. Battery life is short.3. Distance between cellphone & bluetooth could be a fair distance and still no issues.4. No indication how much charge left.Overall am fairly ok with this."
2,"OK headset, not great","As it goes for all cheap stuff, this headset will do the work, but is not great. The battery drains out fast. If powersave mode takes over, and your phone rings, the headset never wakes up. The mic is very feeble, and I have to speak hard for the other party to listen to me."
5,Add an extra year or two to that old AGP computer,"This card is several years old, but if you have a machine with AGP still this is one of the best cards you can get and can still run most newer games. If you can find one of these inexpensive, like a used one, these are great for extending the life of a computer that came out just before PCIe slots replaced AGP like mine.Running Eve-Online, CS:Source, CIV4, and various other games at 1680x1050 high video settings on my AMD 2800+ single core with good results."
5,LaDy MaRmAlAdE!,One of the best song I've ever heard!It's DA BOMB!Christina showed lots of her new powerful voice!Pink put da groove style into it.Lil'Kim made the song funky!Christina made the song powerful and magical!Mya made the song uptempo!Missy Elliott just finished the rest that was missin!This song has tons of great things 'bout it!
4,Good Pump for working mom,I am fortunate that I have a Medela pump that I use at home and the Playtex that I use at work. I actually seem to have better luck with the Playtex than the Medela. Pumping is not painful and I can actually talk on the phone and the other person can't hear what I am doing. I have been working and pumping for about a month now and see no decrease in my milk production. I would definitely recommend this pump to anyone looking for one.
2,Not working for me,"I purchased this pump at a Babies R Us. I got it because it was a little cheaper than the Medela. That was a mistake. I have been back to work for a week and my milk supply is decreasing. And I agree with the other mother who says you need to use lanolin. If not, it can be uncomfortable. I am going to purcahase a Medela soon, before my supply isn't even enough to bother pumping!"
4,Great toy for any photo lover!,"No, it is not the worlds best fish eye lens. But it creates clean, decent, focused images and is a lot of fun, especially this time of year with all the fall foliage (for you northerners). If you are looking for a professional lens, you may want to spring for a real lens, but if you are looking for fun pictures and to play around, this is a great way to go.Just for the record, because I haven't read it elsewhere, THIS IS NOT FOR YOUR CANON 35mm SLR. This is for Canon's digital lenses."
2,cheap but dissapointing,"It's not a Hi-Def lens, if you are looking for a good lens, spend some more money and dont waste it in this lens."
3,watch it,"My daughter loved this, but, she was able to bite it in such a way that the water started coming out of the wing nearest the dragonflies body."
5,Great Teether,Sassy Dragonfly TeetherThis is a awesome teether. It has multiple textures and my baby always chooses this one over any other teether we own. Also since it has a ring on it we can attach it using rings to the stroller.
3,Sized Too Big,"I read the other review and made sure to order a boot smaller than my typical size. I had no idea how off the sizing actually was. I normally wear a 10.5, and after making enough orders found that this boot needs to be a 9 to fit my foot. Too bad I had to cough up shipping to get it right, but I haven't seen this style in stores to try it on. It is a great looking boot, though, which is why I can give 3 stars despite the screwy sizing. I've kept my eye out for years for a brown that wasn't too cowboy fancy or too work-boot dull, and this square toe boot is perfect."
1,Sizing is wrong,"I bought this boot for my husband as a Christmas gift. The sizing is completely off. He always wears a 10 but this is about 1- 1 1/2 sizes too big. Now the 9 is not available anywhere & so I cannot replace it. If sizing is not going to be somewhat consistent, it isn't worth the hassle to shop online."
2,"Heavy, pulls hair, uncomfortable.","Disagree with all of the reviews here, very uncomfortable, very heavy, not a good pillow! The search goes on! The pillow is a pain to set just right and who wants to do that every few hours!"
4,Great frim pillow,"It is nice that this pillow actually is true to size. It fills my king size pillow cases nicely. It may be a little too full, but it has instructions for removing the buckwheat to a comfortable level. This is perfect for a large side sleeper who wants a cool pillow."
4,Perfect for people like me,"Before reading the previous reviews, I had not appreciated how individual the choice of pillows can be.I first bought this type of pillow some time ago from a health food store and immediately liked it -- I have an old neck injury and this supports my head wonderfully. If you sleep on them for a while, though, buckwheat pillows can become a bit funky, so after a while I poured my old buckwheat pillow's insides into my compost pile and bought two cheap ones online. These were thin and insubstantial, and my wife threw them out almost immediately.I ordered these buckwheat pillows after that and would describe them as substantial, and non-allergenic (my wife has terrible allergies). They can be molded to any shape but can feel quite hard once shaped, and they are quite heavy. This happens to suit us fine -- if you are used to down they may not be for you, and if you are looking for something light or delicate you should probably look elsewhere."
1,Cement Pillow,"I don't get the enthusiasm around this pillow; it is like sleeping with your head on the cement sidewalk. Perhaps it is a matter of personal preference, in fairness I am accustom to Hungarian white goose down pillows. I am a side sleeper and prefer a firm pillow but this one is overkill.Word of caution I order two kings (17lbs each), $33.99 nonrefundable shipping charge same $33.99 to return ship - purchase price $133.97.My advice, really really make sure you know that you like ""buckwheat"" pillows before buying this one, the cost to return makes the effort not worth while!"
2,Agonizing neck pain,"I loved this pillow for about a week or two but this morning I woke up and felt great but midway through my morning constitutional, I turned my neck and felt a jolt of the most agonizing pain throughout my neck and upper body that I've experienced this century. It felt like someone hit me in the neck with a baseball bat and I was left with this exquisite shooting pain from my hairline down my shoulder and into my arm. Two Aleves, two ice compresses and two icy hot patches later and I'm much better but it still hurts. You see : Buckwheat pillows are not meant for restless sleepers like me who end up sleeping on little mountains of buckwheat. This puts the neck at an unnatural angle and can lead to the kind of pain that most of us are fortunate enough only to read about... I vow never to buy a novelty pillow again. ""My Pillow"" ended up in ""my garbage"" and this baby will be given to my cat when he does something really wonderful and deserves to tear something up!"
3,Pillow is Hard!,"I, like everyone else here, had tried every type of pillow imaginable to get a good nights sleep so I tried this one. This pillow is hard. The first few days were fine but then one day I had the worst neck & upper back ache that lasted a week using this pillow. Pro's: very large pillow, high quality pillow, colder temperature than regular pillows... Con's: hard as a rock. I gave it a 3 Star because this is my experience & maybe others like it. Now I bought a $150.00 tempurpedic pillow, it's okay but no more painful neck & back..."
2,King size buckwheat pillow,"The pillow is very heavy and ackward to maneuver. I still have neck pains. In the middle of the night when your trying to turn over and move your pillow it's not simple at all. The pillow weighs at least ten pounds. I feel like I'm lifting a potato sack. I would not recommend this pillow to anyone and it's too expensive, $19.99 for shipping and handling for a pillow is ridiculous on top of the price $49.99."
5,Satisfying Solo Guitar Playing,"This is a representation of the epitome of solo guitar playing. The detail of chord voicing, feel, and the tone he gets from his Telecaster is fat...like really thick and phat. The arrangements are so clean and perfect in there execution it may appear that the technical requirements to duplicate these pieces are minimal, but don't be fooled. The ironic thing is Ted never writes pieces for creating a technical challenge, but simply expresses what's stirring inside that gifted musical noggin of his. He was a great teacher and personally set me straight on a ""musical"" approach to playing the guitar. This CD is a must for any serious guitar aficionado."
4,Ted Greene review,"The guitar work is awesome , but it puts me to sleep, I cant make it through the entire album in one sitting."
5,Thanks Ted!!!,"The only thing bad about this album is its the only recording Ted ever released. And now that Ted has passed away there isn't a chance of a 2nd album. I bought the LP to this recording back in 1980 and wore a hole through it trying to learn Ted's great chord voicings and wonderful arrangements. He is/was the best I've ever heard at this type of guitar playing. I had the great fortune to meet Ted and spend a number of afternoons talking guitar with him. He was one of the most humble, genuine people I've had the pleasure to know. Buy this CD, you won't regret it."
2,beware,"The first track from ""Shine On Brightly"" is in mono here, although it is in stereo on original LP, even sound quality of remaster isn't extra good, if you can better release (all ""Shine On Brightly"" in stereo, of course), buy ""Repertoire"" release."
3,Good until you have heard the competition,"I thought this was a good interpretation of this extremely evocative music untill I heard a recording by Daniel Propper, which includes many lyrical pieces of Grieg, but which is far more intense and moving than the Szokolay interpretation."
2,"Chock Full of Cliches, Mediocre Storytelling","Spitznagel looks down his nose at the porn industry while exhibiting writing chops on par with a community college student. His jokes are tired, his references even more so. I wish his editor pushed him past the first and easiest jokes to come up with something fresher. I'm not surprised this book didn't do well. Sex industry memoirs are rarely this boring."
5,So funny!,"I read this book last week while I was on vacation and laughed hysterically the entire book. I've always sort of wondered, you know, what it was like behind the scenes, and this book really gives the reader a wonderful glimpse in such a humorous way. Thanks!"
5,Love this book!!!,"If you think Ghandi is not in heaven because he had not converted to Christianity, then you probably will not want to read this book. It will only make you mad... If, however, you like to focus on the gracious nature of God and leave the determination of one's salvation to Him, then you might like this book. I loved this book and put it second to 'Mere Christianity' on my favorite Christian books list."
4,A Wonderfully Strange Book,"Part biographical sketches, part autobiography, this is a wonderfully strange book. Philip Yancey grew up in a strict Baptist home in the 60's, abandoned Christianity because of its hypocrisy, and then gradually returned to the faith of his youth, but not the religious trappings that he had been told went with faith in Christ. This book is a story of his journeyings, and of the people who influenced him through their writings and life. This book is not for those who feel uncomfortable with God loving & using people who are not ""perfect spiritual specimens"", or whose walk with God may be very different than typical evangelical Christianity. This book will stretch you & challenge you to look at Christ & Christians & Christianity in a deeper way."
3,"Pleasantly, surprisingly educational","This is an anthology of short biographical sketches of 12 renowned people whose life stories have impacted the author.I have never appreciated MLK day and history, to say the least. The kids had extra HW b/c of it and the idea struck me as 'ramming an idea down our throats"".The first short story in Yancey's book is about MLK. It didn't seek to convince me or tell of how wonderful he was. In his personal way, the author conveyed to me a perspective of King, the human, which I had never considered, not that I really knew anything at all. It was so unusually interesting. Reading it was my quiet, humble realization and appreciation of this man.I had only first picked up the book haphazardly. I bought it on Amazon b/c I had lent it out. I would lend it and buy it again, if only for that one story."
5,Soul Survivor by Philip Yancey,This is an excellent presentation of True Christianity for those of us who have been damaged by our experiences in churches. Presents who we are in Christ as opposed to legalistic doctrines of man.Soul Survivor: How Thirteen Unlikely Mentors Helped My Faith Survive the Church
5,Soul Survivor,Philip Yancey is convincing in conveying the influence of the 13 people who caused changes in his thinking. He is very honest in describing how the religious upbringing of his childhood turned him away from faith and the church. These 13 people helped him to regain his faith.
5,Excellent Read for Searching Souls,"Although it was subtle, this book is a balm for those who have been rubbed raw by the church. And through several mentors, Philip Yancey gives us his testimony of how he survived his struggles with the issue of the church. Some people are familiar characters and others I was meeting for the first time, but the book was entralling all the same. I added many books and authors to my wish list as a result of this book and I will definitely read many more by Yancey himself."
3,Proceed with caution,"Can anyone think of a more mixed collection of biographies than this book presents? The chapter on MLK Jr will be a shocker to anyone growing up, as Yancey did, in an all-white church or Bible college in the South. MLK, the putative Communist agent, womanizer, Liberal theologian, and overall troublemaker and disgrace to genteel Christianity, is given a thorough makeover and rehabilitated as a truly Christian hero.Yancey's portrayal of Protestant turncoats like G.K. Chesterton reflects his tendency elsewhere of citing Roman Catholic icons with approval and not pointing out the sheepskin of the Romanist church and the disease of both that tree and its fruit (Matt 7:15-23).It is ironic, therefore, the book should be named Soul Survivor. I recommending staying with Yancey's better works, especially Disappointment with God and What's So Amazing About Grace, both available at Amazon.com."
3,something missing,"Hinkle and NotATameLion say a lot of the things I have to say about Soul Survivor. This is a pretty good book. One of Yancey's best. Still, his books always lack something. It could be that Yancey lacks a little fire. Could just be his less than inspiring prose style. Whatever--something's missing here. As Emeril would say: ""Let's kick it up a notch!"""
1,Still In the Wilderness,"Yancey, sadly, is not out of the woods yet. He has stopped short of true Christianity and has adopted a heretical form of it. His book portrays the gospel as God making ridiculously impossible demands upon humanity. When they strive tirelessly to measure up, the good people admit to being miserable failures. The bad people also fail but won't admit it and become hypocrites. God pours his greasy grace over the whole mess, forgives them all and bids them keep on uselessly trying. Yancey evidently knows knows nothing about God's supernatural power working within us, producing His divine life and righteousness in us. Yancey is on the way but hasn't arrived yet."
4,Gave me a few new ideas.,"When I first read the reviews of this book, I was thrilled! I'm still thrilled -- not just as thrilled.Yancy has been a guide in my spiritual life for years, and he continues to be in this book. There are authors here who I have never heard of and how will read, but there are some ""typical"" evangelical referrals too.Maybe I should be moving on. But I did find this book helpful with new suggestions for reading."
5,Refreshingly Candid...,"I was immediately impressed by the sincerity, boldness, & honesty...and yet the author seems to maintain a fair criticism of society's ""pitfalls"" of organized religion."
5,Helpful Candid look at the inside,This collection of biographical sketches provides an insightful and candid look into the weaknesses and struggles of several influential public christian figures in history.
5,A book that deepened my faith like few others,"Soul Survivor is one of my very favorite Christian books. I will continue to purchase copies to give to my Christian and non-Christian friends. The book focuses on the PRINCIPLES of Jesus and how they can be applied in daily living - and have been successfully applied by Christian and non-Christians over the years. I really love this book.Plus, of course - Philip Yancey is a really wonderful writer.I divide Christian writers into two types: 1)those who start from the Bible and show how it can be applied in daily life and 2) those who write from experience (their own and others') and then show how the Bible relates. Philip Yancey is the latter type. And he does it in style!"
4,Heavy reading,This book blew me away. Heavy reading at times..had to go back and re-read and highlight! Perfect book for those of us who have not had a great church experience at some point.
1,Vermin,"Anuradha Pal is a THIEF. I chose not to continue tabla lessons with her and she refused to give me my money back. She is VERMIN, Nasty and Money Hungry with no Ethics. Do NOT EVER Take classes with this Swine. I own these dvd's and they're rubbish also. Complete waste of money"
4,Pure 80's Pop in French,"If you're a fan of the 80's and like Pop (and have a general knowledge of French), you'll love this. Catchy tunes you'll soon be singing. Also try Partinere Particulaire and Daniel Balavoine."
4,What?,"This is not dark,and this is not like The Cure(fortunely)This is more like joyful,latin pop rock.Luminous,elaborated and sophisticated still simple guitar based thoughtful 80's pop songs in a way La Union or Mecano used to do though Indochine was first,and much better than any of these bands,what can you expect from a band with such song titles as Tiomkin or Punishment Park?This might not be kind with politics but it certainly pleases your ear and mind(have one?use it)"
3,Best REO song ever,"The first REO song I ever heard was the studio version of Riding The Storm Out. I didn't know he wasn't the original vocalist for the band. When I finally heard Kevin I was disappointed. I think Mike has a good rock voice, while Kevin is wimpy sounding. Every time I hear this song on the radio now, they always play the live version. I think that is a mistake."
1,Dated,"This has the studio version of Ridin the Storm out. Other than that it is past its prime. Took a chance that this was the studio version I wanted, but the rest is not worth the money."
2,Good old-fashinoned classic rock,"This first album from REO is simple, honest and satisfying. Nothing fancy or very frilly here. Typical early 1970's classic rock style with some very soulful and fun tunes. Vocals aren't mixed quite high enough in the recording for my taste, but that detracts nothing from the quality of the songs. Try before you buy (always), but if you dig good old roots rock, you won't be dissappointed."
1,Quart Cast Iron Humidifying Kettle,"Purchased this kettle back in December and have been using it ontop of my woodstove to humidify the air. First off, what's pictured is a bronze/gold colored handle; however, when I got it, the handle was actually silver. It was a little annoying, but it was no bigie for me. I bought this because it has a porcelain enamel finish so the inside would not rust (as opposed to traditional cast iron kettles without an enamel finish). Well, after about 2 months of use, it began to rust on the inside. I looked at where it was rusting and it appears the inside of the kettle was not completely finished in enamel (looks like they missed some spots in the coating process). Contacted the seller and the only have a 30 day return policy so I'm stuck with it. :( Too bad for me, but maybe not for whoever might read this review."
4,"Flawed, but very worthwhile film","An amazing lead performance, terrific, strong, stylistic lighting and camerawork, and good supporting performances highlight this true story of a violent, sad, sexy, gay Brazilian pimp and drag queen performer in the 1930s, and his two housemates/earners - one male and one female. Touching, complex, never dull. but somehow doesn't quite add up to as much as it seems like it should. It spends so much time on some elements of 'Madame Sata's story, that it speeds by and glosses over other key moments, especially the ending. None-the less, very worth seeing for all that's good about it, and forgivable for it's flaws."
1,Too difficult to be enjoyable,"I have purchased two of Patrick's DVDs and I won't buy anymore. His workouts are too difficult for me. This DVD is for people with advanced experience with choreography. I LOVE dance aerobics dvds, but this routine is almost like something a cheer squad would do (he has 2 Laker girls with him). Patrick doesn't break the moves down enough to actully learn them before all of the moves are put together. Unless you're an advanced dancer (you almost need professional experience) don't bother with this workout."
3,'It Was What It Was',"3 and 1/2 Stars.Interesting and quirky short story book. It would've been nice if it was longer like Murakami's 'The Elephant Vanishes' or 'Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman' but taken as a set of experimental shorts, these selections work nicely.Set around the Kobe earthquake in 1995, the stories involve a variety of characters each uniquely connected to the disaster. There is a sense of sorrow and guilt running through these stories, but there's also a tinge of redemption and fulfillment to even out the feel (especially in the final story).The book lends itself to a post-9/11 mind state just as it does the Kobe tragedy, parlaying sorrow into hopefulness. Recommended."
5,"Great stories, great copy!","Haruki Murakami is an amazing author. His story telling skills do not fail him in ""After the Quake."" The title of the book might lead one to expect stories with direct relevance to the disaster of the earthquake. The characters are a little more removed from the physical devastation of the earthquake and are brought to confront their owns demons...after the quake. ""Super-Frog Saves Tokyo"" was probably my favorite short from this collection. It has such imagination and at the same time feels so real.The copy of this book that I received from Goodwill Industries in San Francisco was in excellent condition."
5,great job,really told the story from start to finish.I do not think you can understand the first world war (america's involvment) without reading a good bio like this on wilson.I would say this fits the bill for a nice bio.
4,I Live in Chicago But I read New York,"Not for New Yorkers only- this midwesterner is a devoted reader.this is a very good general interest magazine. Even the New York-centric content is relevant to non- NYC dwellers due to the importance of New York .I have read stories here covered nowhere else, the writing is consistently good- quality, and the culture reporting is particularly good. While some of the issues are less useful to me , like Best of New York or Best Doctors, overall this is a good reference even though I am not dining or shopping or living in NYC.And you have to check out the back page! It is the first thing I turn to when my issue arrives."
5,New York magazine subscription,"Truthfully, I thought I had ordered 'The New Yorker'; however, I received my first issue last week and was quite happy with 'New York."" A one-year's subscription for $15 ($19.99 - $5.00 Amazon coupon) was quite the deal! Thanks!"
1,Get with the times already!!! Ever heard of something called E-MAIL?!,I'd give it 0 stars if I could! Cancellation is available only by phone and no answering service after hours so you can't even leave a message for them to call you back?!! Why don't you twist my arm off to force me to keep the friggin subscription!!!
1,Amazon should avoid this dumb promotions.... MAGAzines? please,"amazon should focus in promoting useful stuff not stuff that u see it once and later, it is garbage... u can get mags for free in sites and different other promotions...PLEASE AMAZON.... GIVE US GOOD GOLD BOX DEALS.."
1,Terrible Customer Service from Amazon,I ordered New York Magazine from Amazon over 5 months ago and never received my order. I sent a customer service request with no response. I have just sent a second customer service request.I would not recommend ordering New York Magazine from Amazon.
1,Don't waste your money or get tricked into an auto renewal,The magazine has turned into worthless garbage. It automatically renewed and when I discovered that fact I tried to cancel to no avail.
2,nyorker,The ending date on my current New Yorker address label is still 12NOV12 so it seems that my continuing subsription has not been received by the magazine. Please make sure that the correct date is listed or cancel the subscription. Thank you.
4,Great Magazine,I look forward to this every week. You do not have to live in New York to be able to enjoy this magazine. I live in Chicago and get both Chicago magazine and New York and I enjoy the articles in New York much more. It costs more than any other mag I subscribe to but I find that it is well worth it for how much it is enjoyed.
5,"Great price, great magazine.","If you are a New Yorker this is the magazine to read. It keeps you up to date with everything around town from plays, to museums, books, movies and anything New York. It also has interesting articles to read and cultural reviews. I enjoy reading this magazine very much."
5,Love this magazine,I have been subscibing for over 30 years now and Amazon offers the absolutely best rates. Extending an exiting subscription couldn't be easier or more reasonable.
4,the most touching,this is the most toching picture book i have read since i love you for every. the story of the cat is just so sweet.
4,The Granny-Man,What a sweet book! Really encourages me to start a book of my own about our crazy pets but to realize this was the beginning of Skippyjon Jones just warmed my heart.
5,A Cat for All Ages,"I'd read this book about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it. I just ordered a copy to send to my daughter who has a very old cat. But it is much more than a ""cat"" book. It's a sensitive look into old age and how devastating it can be when there seems to be no reason to live.Oh, and that daughter I sent it to, she's 35 years old. ""The Granny-Man"" touches the heart. It has relevance for all ages."
5,They do the job well,I've been using these for a couple of months and they are fairly comfortable and do the job well.
4,"Great for fans, okay for beginners","Not a place to start, but fans will want the acoustic band versions, which comprises a little less than half the album. Some of the others sound very much like the album versions. The 2 ""new"" songs are fun but nothing to die for."
5,A Great Continuation...,"Wow. This didn't seem like the second book in what is already at least three volumes and the author promises more. Alec and Seregil are trained thieves, or nightrunners, in the country of Skala during a period of brewing war. The necromantic forces of Plenimar, sworn enemy of Skala, are pulling together all the pieces they need to assemble a powerful artifact that will ensure the defeat of Skala. But Alec and Seregil and others are on hand to try to prevent that.Along with the blossoming love-affair between Alec and Seregil and the mysteries surrounding both of their backgrounds, the tale is thrilling and exciting. I almost feel like the story is complete and full at the end of this book. Flewelling is great at spinning a yarn to grab your attention."
4,A fitting sequel,"""Stalking Darkness"" is a great sequel to ""Luck in the Shadows"". The characters are wonderful and you get to know much more about them, like Micum and his family as well as Thero, who isn't as bad as you might think. The growing relationship between Seregil and Alec doesn't bother me personally, but it's very tame and doesn't have a too central role in the story. The end is sort of sad, but fitting and really makes you want to read the third book. I had read this a while ago and I had to wait 3 years! This is a book worth reading."
5,Darkly enthralling,"Stalking Darkness picks up the story that left us hanging in Luck in the Shadows. Flewelling spins an intriguing tale of dark magic, prophecy, revenge and war in this deep-running installment of the series. It touches on many issues with finesse and great plot construction. Amazing storyline. Excitingly and breathtakingly edge-of-your-seat stuff."
5,Exellent Reading,Luck in the Shadows and Stalking Darkness are two of the best reads I've had this year. A pity that Traitor's Moon is taking so long to be released.
4,Very Awsome Book!,This is a great book. It was very straight forward with a few cool surprises. I really loved reading it. I can hardly wait to read the new ones!!MZ
4,Couldn't Put It Down,"I was on vacation when I finished the first book in this series, Luck in the Shadows. This book was supposed to last the whole vacation, and when it didn't I ordered Stalking Darkness to be sent to me--I didn't want to stop reading about these amazing characters! I've read some of the other reviews about some details not being in-depth, and some not making sense, but it all works for me. My only disappointment is that L. Flewelling takes so long for S & A to develop their relationship. I'm hoping that in the 3rd book, we get much more in this area. Calling this a gay fantasy, or gay at all, is a bit of a stretch so far."
2,Second parts are not always good,"I thought this book was going to be like the first one - a 5 star new trilogy to give some air to the series - the thing is that it is full of small deviation from the plo trying to cover a minimun of pages instead of providing a good story. Be smart, keep the first one -"
2,Stalking Alternative Life Styles,Be prepared for a book that spends a significant amount of time advocating alternative life styles.
5,Execellent...but,"This book does not disapoint as the sequel to Luck in the Shadows. The story line continues as Seregil, Alec and other characters battle to stop the evil forces that threaten to overtake the land. To my dismay however, the uncomfortable love relationship between Alec and Seregil continue to grow. It seems to put a twist on everything they say to each other. For open-minded readers.... that's just fine. But for close-minded readers (such as I) , it makes me hesitate to pick up Lynn's next book. But since I am dying to find out what next adventure our two heroes will encounter out of Skala, I must ignore the fact that despite all of Alec's heroism- he is the same age as me, and still a minor! So whenever you decide to speed up on your writing, Mrs.Flewelling.. we're waiting...!"
3,A good book... for open-minded readers.,"For the most part, I enjoyed ""Stalking Darkness"". The story was top-notch. The characters, including the villians, were memoriable and believable. The one story thread that I did not care for was the exploration of Alec's sexuality. Though I enjoyed the book, I will hesitate before buying another of Lynn Flewelling's books."
1,Didn't match photo of item,"The ornament stands that shipped did NOT match the photograph. They have white plastic tips which are NOT attractive. In fact, there is a photo for another item on Amazon.com that matches what was shipped, but doesn't match this item. Beware."
4,Just wahat I aawanted,They are very nice. I I wish they had them in silver. It just took a while to recieve them ;o(
1,Terrible!,"Wow I read that it had limited support, but it doesn't even have drivers for recent versions of windows?!?! I can't get this thing to come up on any of my modern computers. Its a fantastic design, its just too bad they didn't write good drivers for it."
2,A bit uneven...there's better smooth compilations,"Not the strongest compilation I've heard for the market they seem to wish to tap (chill-out, lounge, ambient vibe). It starts out cool enough (""All I Ask"" by Rae & Christian, and the misfire #3 ""Ten"" by Fauna Flash isn't chilled in any way, as it totally houses-out the CD early on and smashes whatever mood it was going for), but it doesn't give us a really classic chill-out track until #5, Hazy Roomz's ""Herbal Essence"", which is a reggae dub-style grinding number with a strong, super-smoothed out vocal on top. After that, it goes in some almost-cool directions with (#6) Futuremind's ""Thru Da Mist"" and (#9) A Forest Mighty Black's ""Sunday City Sequence"", but there's simply not enough strong tracks on here to recommend for new purchase unless you're a DJ looking to pad out his or her after-3 set....."
2,Correction to my previous review,"The track I recommended highly, #5, was actually Smith & Mighty's track."
2,Don't Blame Haim!!!,"You knew what you were getting into when you saw the cover, right? No? Caught it on late-night? I'm sorry to hear that...We can not blame the actors here. No, this is sloppy, horrific, editing and direction. The director it would seem had a hard time coaxing the best from his actors, who, while not overtly talented, could've been motivated and bumped to do better. Sloppy direction combined with useless editing (some of the worst I've seen), wrecked this movie from attaining B-flick status. Still...This is good for laughs (see the getting pulled over sequence) no doubt about it. From the goofy Indian (played by a white dude), to that mildly retarded wolf, over to the wretched make-up. The script is dreadful...and that's a good thing if you're looking for fun.I have, believe it or not, seen worse. Just look at any of Feldman's work circa '95.I don't know...rent it if you are a Haim or Slater fan, or just into awful productions."
1,i have seen this one twice and still don't know what happened,cory hamm isn't going to save his cereer by making junk like this. the story is so thin even the writers can't figure out what's going on.just a waste of time and money
1,No thumbs here but one word...BORING...,"This was a very bad film, with expectable plot. Been done many times before... Wreaks of Jason, but without the surprise. Stay away from this one. Unless it's free on showtime. In that case it is fun to predict, and be surprised that it really is that bad"
3,Fever Lake,"Alright, let's get one thing straight, if you were at paying attention in the begining of the movie you would that the lake could possess anything including cars, wolves, and anything else it desires. Another thing, if you thought that this was boring than you obviously have no sense of imagination. Granted at first it was boring, but when the movie scenes centered around the house and the lake it got at little suspenseful. It is not the best horror flick in the world, but what do expect from a couple of ex-teen idols. At least it is better than some of the cheesy flicks you can find in the horror section at Blockbuster. Oh yeah, by the way Corey Haim is only like 27 or 28 yrs old, but who's counting."
2,Cheesy and confusing!,"I saw it on Showtime one night, and it was like a really cheesy 80s slasher--but worse! It made no sense, and the only scary parts--or supposed to be scary parts--were the last ten or fifteen minutes of the movie. It was weird and boring, and I didn't understand how it all came together. the acting was terrible, and it didn't even seem like the story was put together with any thought. I wouldn't waste my time seeing it if I were you."
2,"2 stars, both for Corey","the only thing good about this movie is that it has corey haim. that is it, guys. also, it's laughability factor, assuming you go into it knowing that it's got more cheese than wisconsin. it's even got the white guy dressed up as an indian, who, of course, is in touch with the land and its spirits (can we say STEREOTYPICAL?). well... it's also got mario lopez, post-SBTB and pre-other half. which has to count for something.but yeah, as a corey fan, i don't regret buying this movie. had someone else played his role, tho, i'd be pretty disappointed."
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!,"This trash DTV horror film should have been released as a DTG (Direct-to-Garbage). Horrible acting, accompanied by lousy script, direction and a completely ridiculous spoof of the Shining at the beggining make this film one of the worst that I have ever viewed."
1,Absolutely terrible.,"The acting was horrible and the directing was even worse. What the hell were they thinking? It starts off interesting enough with a man chasing a woman down with an axe and slicing her to bits, then the killer looks up at this little boy that's hiding in the attic and says something about it'll happen to you and it just ends there. How dumb, boring, and pathetic waste of time. AVOID!"
3,Certifiable sampler,"3 1/2Nice single, no throwaway tracks to dismiss, nothing too outstanding to warrant a must have either, it's obviously gonna depend on how much you want to invest in the artist. Then again, those overwhelmed with this alt-countrified hipster's previous excessively intense releases may ease their way back into a slow but steady refinement of the gifted songwriter."
2,"dated, old, but hits the basics decently","i'm rating this book at 2 stars mainly based on its age. it holds little value now for most unix security curious admins. however, looking through it again i realize that it hits most of the basics (at the time) well. it covers filesystem and access security reasonably well, and the example code is reasonably correct in spirit, if not always in practice.of historical value only, not reccomended."
2,A GH for another english band...,"All my people from my street say:ehi,that's probably the best english group of the millennium.WHAT?Blue are just another band that have for members four pretty boys that sing.And write lirycs with ONE topic:the Love.In this Greatest Hits we can listen all these tracks.Yes,the featuring with Angie Stone and the legendary Stevie Wonder ""Signed Sealed Delivered"" is nice,ok,and maybe the old ""One Love"" is good for our ears,but ""A Chi Mi Dice"",with a text written by Tiziano Ferro,an italian singer,is not the best.No no.The hit ""Bubblin'"" is a kind of Puff Daddy R'n'B song...a kind,yall.Naa...maybe I don't like Blue,but I think that it's better that Curtain Falls."
2,G.H.?Don't you think is too much?,"All my people from my street say:ehi,that's probably the best english group of the millennium.WHAT?Blue are just another band that have for members four pretty boys that sing.And write lirycs with ONE topic:the Love.In this Greatest Hits we can listen all these tracks.Yes,the featuring with Angie Stone and the legendary Stevie Wonder ""Signed Sealed Delivered"" is nice,ok,and maybe the old ""One Love"" is good for our ears,but ""A Chi Mi Dice"",with a text written by Tiziano Ferro,an italian singer,is not the best.No no.The hit ""Bubblin'"" is a kind of Puff Daddy R'n'B song...a kind,yall.Naa...maybe I don't like Blue,but I think that it's better that Curtain Falls.EXCUSE ME BUT I MIS MY PASS SO I'LL REWRITE EVERY REVIEW ;)"
3,Blue Hits!,"Blue are just a one of the slew of UK boy bands. Does anyone remember 911, Orange Orange, A1, Another Level and 5ive? Bros, anyone? Well, they are here for a while and then they disappear. They release a handful of regurgitated covers (in this case ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered... I'm Yours,"" ""Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word"" and ""Too Close"") and then managed to deliver some decent songs, like ""Bubblin'"" and ""Breath Easy."" They have no impact on popular culture and are fluffy, no matter how hard they act. However, it's fun having them come around every now and then. Blue are no less or more than any of their predecessors. Watch each of them struggle with their solo careers. Some turn Robbie Williams, while others go Jason Orange."
3,David Hess is NOT on this CD!,"A search for David Hess turned up this CD, which he is NOT on. David contributed SIX songs to the Cabin Fever Soundtrack, including the closing credits. Do not buy this CD if you are expecting to hear David Hess music from the film, those songs are available separately from David Hess at his own .com"
1,it wasn't very good...,"I personally didn't like it, just my opinion. I don't usually buy soundtracks but the music on this one wasn't very good!"
4,tech & disco,this album was a almost a disappointment. too much floppy disco music/tech. music until you get to listen to disc 2 it jumps!
3,More of the same,"This is an attractive book with attractive shots - in a ho-hum kind of way. I saw nothing ""High Imapct"" in the images, however. The author simply relates how certain shots were made in the all-to-familiar style of this genre. Would much rather see someone get into the philosophy of lighting in an interesting discussion style book (Not the old mannequin heads of the past). I wish writers would actually let us get inside their thought processes - maybe shooting images for a book rather than compiling images already done into a book."
2,Ok,"I was more 'inspirational' vs technical. It basically talked about the inspiration and work it took for this young female photographer to succeed.As for the photo's and techniques in the book, they were pedestrian at best. The finished high impact photo's were just basically tinted.Overall the book info is dated but its a quick read and gets you to think a little outside the box."
5,fantastic,"Why can't every album Dischord puts out be like this? I love this album and I loved this band so much. It's the most beautifully chaotic album I've heard in a long time. Two drums, two basses, two singers, one guitar - any band with that sort of instrumentation which can stay togther is going to be good. Black Eyes really did their own thing, but I'd say this is about halfway between Lightning Bolt and Fugazi. Did I mention the thoughtful and well-written lyrics? Finally, unless you're a turntable-deprived dork, you ought go buy it in the deliciously thick 150-gram vinyl LP format. Whatever. Just buy this album."
4,black eyes,I went to high school with Jacob. He played bass in a band he formed called the Drunk Cows. A couple weeks ago I saw some old high school guys at a wedding and someone told me about The Black Eyes and how it was the most original thing they ever heard. They told me how Jacob is now like some kind of underground cult hero and has a beard that makes him look like the dwarf from Lord of the Rings. That's funny because we remember when it was just a goatee. Anyway Jacob rocked back then and he still rocks today so get this album.

4,Comparable to 'Where's Waldo',"When you head to bed, you're ""snug as a bug in a rug,"" and when you you tell a secret, you've ""let the cat out of the bag."" These are just two of the sayings in Wallace Edwards' MONKEY BUSINESS. Filled with some of the most well-known idioms, as well as illustrations that accompany them, MONKEY BUSINESS is sure to be a hit for all of those ""thinking"" young readers. Don't Forget: Find the hidden monkeys on each page.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"
5,Monkey Business makes a great gift book!,"I love this book because it's different. It helps teach kids various expressions in a fun way. AND it has a fun ""find the monkey in each picture"" thing. The pictures are beautiful and silly. I just love it. I bought three to give as gifts to those families that love good books. This author also has another book, Animalia, that would make a good companion book for a gift."
5,"Hours of word play fun with beautiful, totally -engaging, imaginative illustrations","After checking this book out of our library, my kiddos begged me to buy it. These illustrations engaged them for hours at a time, with gorgeous and creative illustrations to help bring to life common idioms. My 7 yo loves to point out idioms all the time now. Forget treats or cash as a reward, this book, along with any of Wallace Edward's other titles, garnered squeals of excitement from my kids. Great humor and thought-provoking!"
5,Great recording of little-known Tchaikovsky works,"Tchaikovsky's suites for orchestra have received much too little attention, but this recording gives the pieces a long-deserved vindication; idiomatic, sensitive but not overly sentimental and at times very intense, Sanderling and his orchestra offer true value for the little money you'll spend on this CD."
5,MY FAVORITE BOOK,I am not usually a fan of fantasy but this is an exception to the rule. The Talisman is a wonderful blend of horror and fantasy and one of Stephen King's best books.
5,Wonderful,"I can't say, that I am a big fan of Stephen King's or Peter Straub's writings, but this book is simply fantastic! A wonderful story, plenty of amazing characters... you just can't stop reading, till you turn the last page."
4,"Old King, Good King","I never picked this one up back in the 80's when it came out, but since the sequel has hit, I felt compelled to read it. Notbad, don't know how I missed it the first time. The sequel,Black House is surely to please fans as well."
1,wish King would read his own,"I know he is very busy and can't narrate all of his own books -- but I could not stand this persons way of reading this story -- it only added to the confusion of the King/Stuab narrative -- and after hearing King himself read on ""Blood & Smoke"" collection I really knew that this one could have been better -- I made it through 9 or the 18 tapes by sure devotion to my favorite writer -- but then listed it back here for some one else -- I'd rather read it myself --As for the story the two have written -- I'm very sorry to say that I can not agree with most of my fellow fans of King -- the story is choppy and tangled -- it seems to move from one short story to the next with a small thread holding them together --I love most of King's books and was delighted by ""Blood and Smoke"" -- even more since King narrated it himself -- but this combination with Stuab left me wanting -- just my opinion -- read it for yourself -- but be warned"
1,I love wolf,"more than that, i miss him, and felt he should have been better cared for...shame on you SK for making me cry so damn hard!"
2,Not King's best; find it at your local library.,"I won't write a long review summarizing the plot. I am a big King fan, but this book left me disappointed. The writing was well below his normal level, and it didn't really pull me in like most his books. The plot was laughable and contrived, the characters much less ""real"" than any other King book I've read. I think that this should either have been a long series (7+ books) to better develop... everything... or half as long as it was to tighten it up.In summary it is a middling book with a boring plot, uninteresting and hokey characters (Right here right now it's axiomatic!), and probably the worst King book that I've read.I recommend finding this book at your local library, give it a quick read, and if you like it, borrow it. I can't recommend paying for it."
2,UGH!,"A friend of mine bought this for me for Christmas, and I tried to read this, for her sake. I spent three months on it, and now I give up!I'm halfway through it and usually I'm a fast reader. The plots great, but he just didn't write it in a way I enjoyed. I do know a lot of people who really really liked it, so don't take my word for it, I would check it out of a library before buying it, though"
3,"boy, good fantasy","This would get 4 stars if I was 12yrs old again. It reads like a young adult book. It is about a boy named Jack Sawyer who sets out on a quest to save his mother and in doing, much more. In the process he must stop his evil, greedy uncle. I found Jack's mother not to be a likable character. I did have great sympathy for a boy willing to go to any lengths to save his mother, although she is far from the ideal Mom. Being and adult it was hard for me to get pulled into the story and enjoy this fantasy. So, I recommend this book for those still in their teens."
4,The Talisman,"When the author name reads Stephen King, you can already expect one thing, quality. Just looking in a second-hand bookstore there fifteen number one bestsellers. King does not disappoint here in this instant classic written with Peter Straub(another excellent writer). King is a fantastic writer who can switch his genres from horror to fantasy/drama. This book is riveting and more can be expected from the sequel, the Black House."
3,Not as described,"Described as ""like new"". When the book arrived it was in fair condition at best. Also, very slow shipping. Great book though!!"
4,(The Stand) x 2,"I really enjoyed The Talisman, but it did take me a few weeks to finish (I generally read books in 2-3 days - this one took at least 3 weeks). The writing in this book is almost mythological in character, definitely following The Stand's evil-vs-good story.The story is about 12-year old Jack's journey from New Hampshire to California in search of the Talisman. Once he finds the Talisman, his mother's lengthy cancerous illness will be gone, and she will live. The journey is at times bizarre, but never your typical gorey Stephen King.I recommend this book for newbies to King who aren't as interested in the disgusting factor. Bewarned, this book will take a long time to read though."
3,Basically very good - just too long,"I really did like this book - until I had gotten about 2/3 into it - then it bogged down. And, it's not the length, per say, that's a problem - I love ""The Stand"". However, the story itself is very good - I really liked the characters and the relationships between the them. It just took too long for Jack and Richard to get into that hotel once they arrived in CA. While I probably won't read this again, I would recommend it to folks."
5,Best book I have ever read,"All I can say is, this is my favorite book. I have read it 5 times over the years, wish I could read it more often, it never gets old!"
4,The Talisman by Stephen King & Peter Straub,"This book was in good condition for it's age, and I received it promptly. The Talisman is a book I read in 1985, and I remembered how much I enjoyed it. This time around was just as good. Thank you, GypsyChief"
5,A fairytale for grown-ups,"This is an incredible book, you just get lost in the story...it has all the essential fairytale elements; the queen endangered, the knight errant (even if he is just a little boy...but what could be purer than the love a little boy has for his mom?) It has monsters, evil and powerful men...unspoilt realms...I really cannot say enough about what an incredible story this is...you just never want it to end."
5,"A classic and unexpected story, Right Here and Now!","I have read about 25 Stephen King books and always new this one was out there but for for some reason I never picked it up, with the Black House now out I figured I should pick up the Talisman and I am glad I did. The story is full of fantasy, supsense, horror and wonderful imagery. I recommend it to all Stephen King and Peter Straub fans."
2,I Must Be One of the Minority...,"Based on other reviews and people I've talked to, I must be one of the few who didn't really enjoy this book. As others have said it does start out kind of slow, then some seemed to find it picked up after Jack got into the territories, which I did, but then I found it kind of did a yo-yo between interesting and boring. I sat there going ""Finally! Now it gets good!"" And for awhile it did, but some parts are rather pointless (the Oakley Tap was pretty lame for example). Usually Stephen King makes interesting, complex characters which Jack started out to be--and maybe it was Peter Straub's influence--but he started to seem not so real for me. The action was too slow for my taste and all in all I just didn't really care what happened to any of the characters. I'm sure others disagree with me, sorry, but that's my two cents. Two stars for good description and because I didn't actually have to pay for the book, someone gave it to me when we were camping one time;)"
5,A Tremendous Tale,"Those critics who label King as a Horror writer need only to read the Talsiman to fully understand what an abhorration that label is. This novel is a terrific fantasy story set in different dimensions and realms, and is very similar to Tolkien's The Hobbit and C.S Lewis' The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. The story is masterfully told, and is completely encompassing. Once this book begins, you yourself will feel you are on the journey for the Talisman, treking through worlds and situations you would have never dreamed. For those who are looking for a great fantsay yarn, read this novel."
3,Worthwhile read,"I did enjoy this book, although it did get confusing at times, and maybe reached out there at other times, not knowing where it was going when it was being written, but eventually it does all work together.Jack is certainly amazing character and I loved his ""god pounding"" friend Wolf. I did enjoy the theory of ""twinners"" in other worlds. It is simply a book of good versus evil. With a bizarre and somewhat strange ending. For being such a ""big"" book it does go fairly quickly."
2,Epic...failure,"Even with the fantasy angle and the ability to suspend reality, this book is so contrived that it becomes quite ridiculous. Seriously, if they go and read this book again, the authors can't really be happy with the final product. Don't believe me? Then I urge you to read it for yourself. Then try and get that time of your life back. Now we've both been suckered. Don't say you weren't warned."
3,modern day Tom Sawyer,"Although I didn't enjoy this novel as much as I did when I read it at 14, I still felt it was a great coming of age Sci-Fi novel. In short the story is about a young boy's travels across america and a parallel land called the territories. He's forced to make this journey in order to find a cure for his mother's cancer.During his travels he incounters both fantastical and realistic evil. He also encounter allies within both worlds. The best part of this novel is the development of the young naive Jack (young lead character) to the strong and confident jack at the end. As the reader, I felt afraid for him in the beginning during this journey and wondered how could a young 12 year old boy survive? By the end, I felt completely confident of jack's abilities and didn't doubt that he would succeed.Although there have since been better sci-fi novels (Tad William's,, Otherland series). The Talisman is still one of the best novels to merge the coming of age story with science fiction."
2,Extremely boring,"I am a regular Stephen King fan. I love all his books (Carrie, Pet Semetary, Cujo), exept this. I couldn't even finish! I am aware that in most of his books the beginning can be a little dull, but give me a break! I love you, man, but try to do a little better."
5,"I am only allowed 5, but I really give this book 10 stars!",These characters are so well described that you feel that you know them. Jack's trials and tribulations are so true to life that through King's writing you live them yourself. P.S. It hurts so good!
2,"I love the book, but not the condition it came in.........","The book was fantastic, my review is not of the material in the book but on the condition it arrived in. I bought it as a gift and now am too embarassed to give it! I bought it used in ""excellent"" condition. There are stains all over the book, it is dirty and very well used in my opinion. Never buy a used book from amazon."
4,Just what I wanted,Book was received so quickly and in exactly the condition described by the seller. I would definitley purchase from this supplier in the future!
5,This is my favorite novel!,"I can't think of many examples of popular fiction that can be revisited like an old friend. Always there for a memory, a laugh, or a tear. ""The Talisman"" manages to be all that and more. Classic tale of a boy-hero. King's kids are always great. Straub grows them up in a hurry.What wonderful friends and fantastical enemies Jack has in this tale. You care about him, his friends, and all that happens to him in his quest. I cannot say enough about this one. I think my copy is dog eared enough! Save this one for a week long vacation. You won't need to leave your home to travel on this magical journey. Thank me later! Skip the sequel! 'tis awful!"
4,"read it 30 yrs ago, a good reread","Overall enjoyed the adventure, wonderful suspense! (sometimes a little wordy, got a little off track) However when a writer can express his story with such perfect detail that your mental images are distinctly vivid, & all your senses are heightened till all of your muscles are tense, ....Definitely the sign of a great book Wonderful Character in ""Wolf"" couldn't help but love and long for his simplicity."
5,Have loved this book for years!! Glad it's finally an ebook so I can add yet another copy to my collection!!,Read this book the first time when I was in my teens and have loved it every since. Read it several times over the years and I was glad they finally released it in an ebook. Thanks.
5,it's beautiful,"This is one of my favorite books ever. I am a great fan of SK and this is one of his greatest work. This book has touched me in a way no book ever did. I have read it a few times and each time I enjoyed it more.I'm not much older than Jack (17) but I know that I would have had trouble in dealing with all he goes through. Most of the things he sees will send a regular man over to LoonyLand, and in my opinion what saves Jack is his age. His belifs, behaivor, dedication and way of thinking can only belong to a child. That makes us think about our life as adults.It is a beautiful story about a beautiful boy."
4,"An awesome adventure that will have you hypnotized! You'll remember, THE TALISMAN.",King teams up with peter straub this time and delivers an amazing unforgettable story. The way king and straub guide us through a parallel world known as the territories with young jack sawyer on a quest to save his dying mother is superb! This novel has tons of great characters and landscapes and is just all around an extremely cool book. Highly reccomended.
4,what a wild ride!,"Ok you are in for it! Do you appriciate horror and fantasy and a Harry Potter-like taste for an alternate reality? A young boy must go on a quest to save someone he loves and he finds both horrifiying and exhilirating adventures, as well as meeting a friend who is one of fictions most endearing characters, Wolf. You can't go wrong ith this book-a family favorite from teens to adults that aren't afraid of strange and lovely things that may or may not be what they seem!"
1,One of the Worst,"I just finished The Talisman, and, yes, I had to force myself to finish it. It was one of the worst Stephen King novels I have read (I'd say even worse than The Tommyknockers). It was wordy, the character development was terrible, it was, in general, a big snooze! I may be missing something ""mythic""...but this was one bad book."
1,I really didn't care for this book,"I made it half way through this book, and simply had to put it down (I kept hoping for it to get better the whole time). The main reason why I picked it up was to get more about the Dark Tower series. The characters all seemed very superficial, and the plot was very forced. King usually does a better job at introducing and fleshing out any character in his books. His style usually is pretty continuous; no abrupt jumps or holes... I'm a huge fantasy fan, and I've read a dozen other Stephen King novels; this book was by far the worst I've read of his so far."
1,Vastly overrated,"This book starts off quite well in a grim, seedy out of season holiday resort but then just floats off into overlong cliche-ness. The chracters are paper-thin; tough, wise-cracking mother who's dying, blues playing wise old black guy, fat, cowardly but ultimately nice kid, pantomime villains, liberace-like camp villains and of course the good kid ripped off from Mark Twain (Jack SAWtelle anyone?). Any emotional envolvment this book entails is played upon like a harp (Wolfs death....) and the book is much too long. There is far too much detail as well telling of the main characters every move and breath. I suppose its alright if your in hospital or something and bored but this is mainly a pulpy, trashy, derivative piece of work."
5,I found myself travelling along with Jack! Great book!!,"King & Straub make the characters come alive, they seem rea"
3,"Stephen King, is that you?","I'm not really sure how to react to this book. If you're looking for classic King, move on. This isn't it. Right away, you can tell it's co-written. It's neither horror nor psych-thriller, like most of the rest of his work. At first, it struck me as a nerdy adventure story like my 8th grade lab partner would have liked. The story meanders here and there, mostly tedious, sometimes exciting in a really dangerous sort of way. The strange thing is, I didn't really like the story much, but I couldn't put it down. About 150 or 200 pages in, the main character, Jack, gets a travellin' buddy, and the story becomes a bizarre ""Of Mice And Men"" parody. The new character is amazingly endearing. Maybe that's what kept me going. Much like the book, my review isn't really going anywhere. There's just not a lot to say about ""The Talisman."" If you're looking for a story about a kid on a survival adventure all alone, go for ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,"" instead."
1,O MY GOD!,"EVERY DAY I GENUFLECT BEFORE MY STEPHEN KING IDOL! NOT ONE SINGLE DAY GOES BY THAT I DON'T!THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN! FORGET THAT IT'S AN OVERWROGHT, SUFFOCATING DISPLAY OF BRAND-NAME DRIVEL! I HAVE READ IT TWENTY TIMES!IT IS TOO COOL! STEPHEN KING IS, LITERALLY, MY IDOL!"
3,sucked until about the middle,this book sucked until about the middle of it when things actually started to happen
2,The Talisman: A Love-Hate Relationship,"I loved this book, and I loathed this book, all at the same time. Okay, the story alone was good. I enjoyed most of the story. Unfortunately its graphic descriptions and foul use of metaphors I could do without. The authors have a horrible time getting to the point, and filling the pages with mindless (sometimes useless graphic descriptions). It is god awful long and it could do without several hundreds of pages. NOT RECOMMENDED for anyone under the age of 16. My eyes and thoughts were frequently, offended by the VERY GRAPHIC, highly unnecessary, and often at times pornographic metaphors. I think if the authors spent less time trying to nauseate the reader with pornographic details, and more time getting to the point of the story it would be a better story. There are just too many story detours to actually make it an enjoyable story. Because of this story I will NEVER pick up a novel with Stephen King's name attached to it, again."
4,Really Really Good...ONCE YOU GET INTO IT.,"It took me 3 months and a 150 pages to get into this book. Three months because that's how long it took me to cover the first 150 pages. After that, I finished the book in two days. I don't know, the beginning to this book is...is so goddamned slow. I know some people will lash me for that one, but hey I love Steve King...Peter straub, I plan to read some of his...but I mean, the beginning sucked. Anyway, I know this is a little harsh. Oh well. anyway past that I thought the book was excellent and would reccomend it to anybody willing to plod through crap for a while (damn this is harsh). Right now I am just starting Black House the sequel and so far it's started out so much better. Anyway, read this book, it's good, just slow at the start.--Dustin"
5,My Favorite Book...,"I have read many, many books in my lifetime (I'm 22...), in all catagories. The Talisman is by far my favorite book. I have read it five times, usually in the winter, and it never gets old. It's the perfect novel. I highly suggest it to everyone. Go read it!!"
5,Unquestionably King and Straub's best.,"My main problem with King novels has always been his ineptness with action sequences. They just never seemed very entertaining. But with Straub on board and a massive amount of pages, he finally hits his stride, and has never been better."
5,Good and evil toe to toe,"I wallowed in this one -- it's got everything: a boy on a quest to save his mother and another world, a mystery, really BAD bad guys, well drawn characters (courtesy of Straub) and an exciting plot and menacing mood (thanks to Steven King). Sometimes King can be troubled by dealing with such enormous concepts as good and evil in other than cartoonish form, which sometimes leads to unsatisfactory plot resolutions. I think his collaboration with Straub here makes for a breathless ride. If you liked Straub's ""Ghost Story"", King's ""Bag of Bones,"" Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy, you'll love this -- if you hated any of these, don't bother with the ""Talisman."""
5,REFLECTIONS IN THE WAVES OF A MESMERIZING MIND;,"King yet agains shows how thin the line is between what is reality and what is myth,,and how easily those worlds can meld in and out of each other...And how easily it is for us to confuse the 2 and forget which is wich...King himself, is majical and somewhat of a myth..If you can't appreciate him then you're brain-dead..And a good subject for a novel.."
2,"Conceptually interesting, not original, lonnnnnnng book...","I've read a good number of Stephen King books and I liked the sound of this one so I picked it up. One of King's tendancies is to take a good idea and overdetail it to death. This books is a good example. Over 600 pages, I'd say it could have been comfortably done in under 400 and been readable. I forced myself to finish it, in spite of the obvious ending because I hate to put down a book unread. Read the first three books in the Apprentice Adept series by Piers Anthony for a similar theme and much better execution."
4,The Talisman,"Title: The TalismanThe story was hurt by the ""Horror"" component, but Mr. King's portion of the work rang true as always.Rich Blake"
5,An excellent book,"A totally awesome book.An excellent blend of fantasy and macabre. Jack i thought was a little cardboard, and I thought he didn't have much personality,But Wolf and all the others were very well thought out and written. I like Wolf, and pitied Richard, all in all it was an excellent book."
3,okay,"This novel was.... alright. By any other standards, I would consider it above average. But we musn't forget that this is Stephen King we are considering here - one of the most prolific and (in my opinion) most entertaining authors of this century. And I truly believe that much of his work will continue as true 'literature' (what a subjective term!) throughout the ages. But this piece would certainly not quality. I don't know if the Peter Straub collaboration had anything to do with it, but nevertheless - it is somewhat cheesier than his better stuff. Merely an opinion, but it's why we write these reviews."
5,Stephen King at his finest!,"I can make this really quick!! Buy The TALISMAN.. Lock your door, find a very comfortable spot and be prepared for a long non-stop read. You will not be able to put this book down. A true page turner in the signature style of King. You will love It!!"
4,Pretty good!,"I liked the Talisman. King truly gets you into his stories. He makes you root for the good guys and hate the bad guys!!!! I enjoyed the travels this poor boy goes thru, between getting stuck in arm pit bars or staying strong for his best bud even when he is dead tired and only 13yrs old. I believe there is a sequal to this book~ I would love to find out what happened after ALL THAT TRAVELING!!!I would definetly recommend this book. Lots of great characters, I even cried a couple of times thru the book~ Very good!!!!"
2,"Probably Healthy, but not tasty","To me these were like a cross between a fruit rollup and all bran cereal. They were dry and chunky and not very tasty. I'm sure if you are into healthy foods and think solely of the health benefits versus something more tasty, then these may not be too bad. I bought them for my children to eat as snacks, they about gagged them up. I think perhaps I will try to find something with a little less fiber and a little more taste."
3,Really healthy...,"I bought these because I tried some of the other Kettle Valley products and thought that they were a nice cross of really healthy and tasty. This one moved a bit too far into the healthy and fiber content at the expense of taste for me. Seemed a little more like cardboard than fruit, allthough I'm sure it was really good for me."
5,128Mb Memstick Duo is reliable,"This SanDisk 128mb Memstick Duo is a great addition to the flash drive based family. The Memstick Duo and Pro Duo series was co-created by Sony and SanDisk in the hopes of creating a flash-disk with high speed, high capacity and all-around usability that is easy for all end users. Its usefullness is only limited by one's imagination. Compadible with all sorts of cameras, media players and the almight Playstation Portible console system. Although this particular model is starting to be outdated due to its limited storage size in an ever increasing memory glut, this stick will serve the basic needs of novice and average consumers taking pictures, saving personal data, or game saves. 5 stars for what it does. Reliable and fast, the Memstick Duo is a great choice in today's flash memory world. Pick yourself up one, or a couple."
4,A pleasant diversion,"Since the previous reviewers went into great detail to cover the plot, I will only say that reading it was an entertaining and pleasant way to spend a day. I generally don't read romance novels, but the historical aspect of the story intrigued me. Ms. Gist did a most impressive job on her first novel. There were a few loose ends that in my mind never quite fit together - the biggest was Josh, but maybe that's for a sequel. The picture on the cover of a bride in a formal gown has nothing to do with this story as she is married in oversized homespun."
4,America the soon-to-be,"American pioneer stories are some of my favorites. We see the English lady being shanghaied to the colonies to provide a wife for a backwoodsman who, himself, is forced by puritanical rules to settle the land and multiply. Life expectancy was extremely short in 1644 no matter where one lived, but especially in the wilds of Indian country.There were a few Bible verses to help support the characters and move the story along. I wasn't bored once with the 347 pages, but did find it incredible that anyone would prefer living in these hazardous surroundings than back in the motherland where life was easier, money available and relatives to help out in a pinch.I also learned about the Indian Wars of the 1640's, that 400 colonists and many more Indians were killed in just one such battle and that rowdy settlers who broke treaties was the probable cause of native attacks. I can't help but think we owe our forebears to keep their hardwon freedoms intact in this frustrating 21st century."
4,Great premise and good story telling,"Although this book had many wonderful parts and a great beginning, as well as a spunky, likable heroine, I found the abrupt switch from a fun historical romance to an inspirational novel jarring and sudden. The inspirational/religious parts just didn't seem to evolve naturally. I like all her books but this wasn't as outstanding as I've come to expect from her writing. I loved the heroine and really sympathized with her. I grew to like the hero, although I didn't quite fall in love with him. Still, over all, it was a good book that I could recommend to others."
2,A reader most repulsed,"Ok, maybe if you are desparate for a Christian romance novel this might be your thing but the writing was pathetic. The author attempts to write the dialog in the style of the year in which the story is set and the experiment fails. Even if you want a Christian romance novel I don't know how this would fill the bill. There isn't that much talk of Christianity but the two romantic leads realize they care deeply for each other because of the faith each one has in God. This is never demonstrated in the book and the two characters don't even speak to each other about it, they somehow just know that about each other."
2,A Christy winner? Really??????,"I could have given this book 3 stars- except it was soooooo overrated that my hightened expectations were doubly slashed.I love to love my protagonists. I find neither Constance nor Drew to be likeable characters. While Constance makes a turn and becomes more likeable at the end she is still irritating and I wasn't really cheering for her. And Drew! Really, am I supposed to be rooting for him? HE'S the HERO?The premise of the book was excellent. I loved the idea of this book. I just think the author failed in its execution. If you want likeable characters to cheer for, hope for, this is not the book for you. Neither are very likeable from the start and they don't get much better toward the end."
3,A Bride Most Begrudging,Not my favorite Deeanne Gist book but it was also her first (so they got better!) I had a hard time with the first half of the book but the second half was better.
3,Shallow,"Great potential, original plot, but way too Christian for my taste. If I'd realized the book was published by Bethany House Publishers (Christian publisher), I wouldn't have downloaded it at all. That being said, it was a fairly entertaining read, but the character development is rather shallow, which detracts from an otherwise interesting story."
2,Couldn't finish it,"While the writing itself was quite nice, and the story was captivating up to about the half-way point, I couldn't finish it. I was put off by Drew's aversion to the red hair and freckles, but that wasn't the worst part. He's a total jerk -- not a guy a woman reader would swoon over. I found Constance to be inconsistent and kind of dumb for a woman who's supposed to be intelligent. The scene in the forest with the Native American guy -- not plausible in the least. I got so frustrated with the characters, I moved on to the next book in my list without finishing it."
3,I thought I would really like these books,Though the author writes well I found the books a bit boring. Then at the end was this religious stuff that had no basis in the book before so I wondered where it came from? It was not a bad read and I loved the characters but it is not something I would want to recommend to friends. I have read about three of her books now and found them to have enjoyable parts and very interesting characters but I think I have read the last of her books.
1,I can't finish it!,"I have tried hard to read this book because I didn't get it for free, wish I had.This book won awards! How? It is a terrible book, characters have no real relationship, gross subject of a man having to eat a worm because he missed it on a tobacco plant, Constance isn't even close to real, Drew no better. Just a terrible book, I can't finish it.I have read a couple of Gist books that I loved but this is about the worst book I have tried to read from any author.I certainly will not recommend it to anyone. BJ"
4,Enjoyable Read,"An enjoyable read with just enough historical detail to give you a sense of the setting without going too indepth (which sometimes takes away from the story that's trying to be told). The characters were well written and I enjoyed the tale that was woven throughout the novel. The only thing I didn't like about the book was toward the end during some of the more intense drama that was written...the heroine seemed to be 'out of character', she didn't have the same feel as the rest of the novel. Throughout most of the book she'd been presented as strong and resiliant, only to be portrayed in an almost childish light for a few pages. It made me wonder if the author had gotten writer's block at that point and been struggling to find something, anything, to write for the character. Other than that it was a nice book, refreshing to find a romance that wasn't full of sex scenes."
4,100% Chick lit!,"Ok, this book is cheesy, sappy and overly sentimental--but I must confess that I enjoyed every second of it! It's far from a literary masterpiece: the writing is marginal, the plot unrealistic, and the historical authenticity is questionable (the characters act far too modern). Despite all this, I relished the story and raced through the pages because the love story is just so darn sweet. If you are looking for a book that is sheer escapism and doesn't require a lot of thought, this one fits the bill. The characters are developed enough to connect with and the plot moves along at a nice pace with lots of emotional turmoil and I-love-him-but-can't-be-with-him-does-he-love-me goodness. The best kindle freebie I've gotten so far!"
2,ok... not what i was expecting,This is a Christian novel which I did not realize when I purchased on my kindle. It was decent but obviously there were lots of religious references which i found utterly distracting. Not my cup of tea but the story beneath all of that was decent. I wish Amazon would label these these better for kindle user!
2,Didn't reach the high expectations,"This book was recommended to me by two good friends who said it was just as good as Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers and so my expectations were high. Too high. I found this book ok as a holiday read but it was very predictable and I don't feel drawn to the characters at all. I was disappointed, I probably wouldn't have been as disappointed if it hadn't had such high recommendations but disappointed nonetheless.I actually bought this book as a 3 in 1 (The Trouble With Brides) and I enjoyed the other two stories much better so it was good to see that this author does have some talent but I wouldn't recommend this one as anything special."
4,Well written and very enjoyable,"This book is historical Christian romantic fiction. The historical aspects of it were very interesting, taking place during the 17th century in colonial Virginia (which is ironically set very close to where I live- I did not know this when I purchased it). It includes many aspects of colonial life of which I was unaware. It is Christian fiction without being on a soapbox. Certain parts felt a bit rushed and at one point it seemed very anti-women's education as a theme. I don't know if that was the aim of the author- it seems unlikely as the author is a female. I suggest giving this book a try.Overall I rate it a solid 4 stars. =)"
3,fluff,"I definitely consider this book better than The Measure of a Lady, though just by a hair.Someone else already mentioned the historical inaccuracies so I won't even go there.The main character, Constance was a bit more sympathetic though the ""man"" Drew was very frustrating and couldn't make up his tobacco picking mind what he was going to do with Constance. The secondary characters were barely fillers and uninteresting.There was only one part of the book towards the end that made me think, ""oh no!"" But also towards the end of the book I got to a point I just wanted it to end and I started to think about what book I was going to read next. That's not a good sign.Honestly, I wouldn't recommend any of the two Gist's books I've read."
1,Awful!,"Ugh, ugh, ugh, I love historical fiction, but this is so poorly written, I didn't make it past the first 50 pages. Seriously, the protagonist talking to herself using words like ""forsooth""? I got this for free from the Kindle store and it wasn't worth what I paid. This was the first book I ever actually deleted from my Kindle."
1,"A ""christian"" Bodice Ripper haha","This book is TERRIBLE! The author has taken a Harlequin romance and put a few ""Dear Lords"" in there and called it a Christian novel. I agree the lust and cleavage talk is offensive. The writing was just plain painful and laughable. And the characters are as shallow as a puddle. I honestly could not give more than 1 star.Extremely unrealistic and poorly done.What a joke Constance was. She is kidnapped, sent across the ocean as a tobacco bride and forced to marry (all the while being from royalty) and yet is as cool as a cucumber and saucy to boot.Drew was a brute.And it was so boring in places. How long does it take to describe washing trenches or needing to go to the bathroom?. Arrrgh!And it won the Christy Award. Those awards have lost all merit with me.The whole book was ridiculous and very disappointing ."
1,TMI,"Too much attention to physical desires and not enough to love. Superficial christian message. I will not be reading anymore of her books. I agree with another reviewer this is soft ""christian porn""."
3,Just couldn't get into it,"I really just couldn't get into this book. It seemed like the main characters fell in love way too quickly, a bit unrealistic. If you want a good love story, read Redeeming Love by F. Rivers."
1,Lust is still a sin,"I agree with another reader who stated that the characters never really get to know each other or fall in love with who the other person really is because of the lust factor. The Bible states that lust is a sin. Even when you lust after your wife. You should LOVE your wife but not lust after her. Lust is a selfish motivation to fulfill your own desires.. is that how God loves the church? I don't think so. Sex inside of marriage sure, but it should never be just about getting what you want from the other person. In my opinion the story lacked romance because real romance is about love and not lust. Lust is very unromantic to me. It read like a trashy novel. Just my opinion."
4,Simply a Good Inspirational and Historical Romance Book!,"A great read that does not preach the inspirational aspects of the story to you. A very solid read for me. I am not someone who generally reads Inspirational Historical Romance but since I got the Kindle, I have downloaded two of them, this being one of them and was really impressed that the Christian Religion aspects of this story were not too heavy and did not make me feel like I was being preached at. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good love story with a deeper message!"
4,I enjoyed it!,"I've devoured all of Deeanne Gist's books on my Kindle...except for Deep in the Heart. . . . which isn't available yet. As a 6o-plus-year-old woman of the world, I thought I'd outgrown romance novels decades ago, however I must say I found all of Ms. Gist's books well done, very interesting and great fun. I'm looking forward to Deep In the Heart."
4,Awesome historical romance novel,"I really enjoyed this book! Although it does carry a religious message, (probably because of the nature of this time period), I think it portrayed the struggles of the new American colonists very well. I liked way the romance fits in historically. I especially liked Constance as a character. I found the ending very abrupt."
4,Great read,This is a historical romance that captured me from the get go with a kidnapping. I figured I couldn't lose since it was free. It didn't let me down.
1,Didnt know it was a bible thumping book,"WAY big thumbs down to this book.I had no idea when I bought it that it was a book with a Christian message.I was a little offended and feel that there needs to be better tagging of books. As a person of the Jewish faith, I didn't need to read about how all things are possible if you give your life over to Jesus.What the eff ever."
3,90%,"Am always excited to come across a free download, because it usually means I've found a new author whose follow-up books I'll purchase. Unfortunately, after reading ""A Bride Most Begrudging,"" I'd be afraid to buy future Gist books in case they end the same way. For the first 90% of the novel, Gist created enchanting and believable characters, and made the readers care. Unfortunately, without giving away too much, the last 10% takes the tragedy of American settlers too seriously. I've looked up to see if Gist has written a follow-up novel, in hopes that more storylines get tied together, and from what I've seen it doesn't look like it."
1,Got lost in the tension,"I had been wanting to get this book for a long time; thought the cover looked beautiful and the story line sounded intriguing. Even with all this I wasn't majorly disappointed in the book, but still did not like it. At first I chalked it up to a first time writer's inexperience but after reading some reviews from her lastest, decide that my chalk up wasn't correct.My reason for not liking it was the fact the main characters were obsorbed with their sexual attraction to each other to the point where I couldn't define much a personality to each beyond the lady's love of math and the man's desire for her to stay in her place. I believe that a Christian should experience sexual attraction; it's the way God made them, but not to the exclusion of other things like falling in love with the actual person."
2,The ICE MELTED,"I am so glad I kept my VHS copy of the movie. This DVD was advertised to play only on a DVD player. It wouldn't. It would play on the DVD-R Recorder, and it worked once. After that, it skipped and paused and jumped chapters. Finally, I discarded the movie since it would do the same at several different locations. Thank goodness for friends who would let me try to play the movie at their homes, too. Very disappointed..."
3,Warning CD exercises do not follow book at all!,"When someone ""borrowed"" my 1st edition, I was glad to be able to get an Audio CD with this second edition. But, the CD chapter exercises do not follow book exercises. The familiar exercises at the end of chapters is a nice touch, but I was disappointed that CD doesn't match up with these. The book itself is a good taste of Spanish slang from around the world. The book is especially good for the learner who has become bored with the usual textbook vocabulary from beginner's Spanish."
3,"Interesting supplement, but I can't focus in it","This book presents slang in a chapter by chapter format each with new topic, greetings, put-downs, love, etc. The format is concise not exhaustive, meaning you must reread bits and pieces at your own pace until you develop and understanding. Even if you don't memorize every phrase, by reading the chapters you get a feel for Spanish idioms and slang so later you are more aware that you are hearing/reading colliquial Spanish, even if the terms were not in the book. My difficulty with this book is that I hesitate to use the phrases until I've heard a native speaker ratify the authors advice. Whether that's the authors fault or my own, I still wouldn't use this as a focus of study, more of a supplement and reference guide."
3,Must be a intermediate student to get the hang of it,"I got this book to talk to a South American friend I have at my job. I took Spanish a decade ago so I don't remember the basics like sentence construction, verb and noun tenses so it was confusing for me. Also the dialogues for the different colloquialisms are on limited situations. The CD doesn't have the dialogue to English translation on it so you have to refer back to the book which is a pain if you're driving. I have to get a beginner Spanish book to brush up on the basics to try to get a clearer understanding of the info."
2,Not helpful,Only slighlty useful. The CD is of no use at all for learning - it has too little information about too few places. It would have been better to teach U.S. urban terms instead of jumping from country to country giving single phrases.A waste of money.
2,revisiting my previous negative review,"After a frustrating experience in which I received my ""in good condition, book w/cd"", without the cd, and having been promised a refund, which didn't show up after many weeks of receiving no reply to my email inquiries, and having to repurchase the book from a reputable seller, I finally did get my long-promised refund...TWO DAYS AFTER POSTING A REVIEW! Now they've asked me to remove it, stating, ""As you can see, we try very hard to make sure our customers get fair treatment and to fix any mistakes we make."" Actions speak louder than words. And since my experience can't be deleted, I won't delete the review. They did finally make good, for whatever it's worth. Hopefully they will do better in the future."
3,Is it practical for me?,"It looks good - When I showed it to a Spanish speaking teacher, they felt it was not too practical for my use.I would send it back but probably will not"
4,A great read,"Considering the lack of access the author had to the key principals, he sure did write a good, clean, fast read. The book and financial lingo was simple and easy to understand. I know that all the investors losing money is not funny, in fact I am one of them, but the hubris that comes through from all the so called investing experts is amazing."
3,"If You are a Wall Street Junkie, This is Your book","Assuming you have an adequate background to understand their trades, I think anyone who was inthe fray during the bleak days of 1998 will find this account faxcinating. If you followed the LTCM demise closely in the press, as I did, you may have thought you understood their situation well at the time. I know I did. After reading this book, I learned how little I really knew at the time, and how much worse and scarier the situation truly was.Not exactly Liar's Poker in its readibility, but a useful addtion to the cannon. Just don't expect light beach reading, particularly if not fluent in swaps, derivatives and arbitrage."
5,Thoroughly entertaining,"The book is the story of LTCM. As often happens in the markets, a fund starts brilliantly and then crashes spectacularly. LTCM is but one of many examples. Based on mathematical models, the fund was doing very well for a while. Success brings confidence, and the managers started changing the methodology, became reckless with risk management and ended up with overgeared positions. At the end, as it happens, just about everything went wrong. The result - near collapse of world markets.Very interesting read. I think especially useful for traders. Taleb's ""Fooled by Randomness"" was coming to mind continuously while reading this book."
3,Here we go again!,"Interesting read...After this debacle, you'd think that the ""pros"" on Wall Street would've learned something. But all you have to do is look at the current mortgage/credit mess to realize that they haven't. I guess there will always be bubbles and bubbles always burst!"
4,"Very Interesting, though Opionated","This is a very interesting book. I really enjoyed reading it, even though I disagreed with some of the conclusions that Lowenstein would draw.Even though Lowenstein damns LTCM at the end, I think the actual lesson from LTCM's demise is that first movers (or the first people to start picking apples from the tree) can make a ton of money. The founders of LTCM were brilliant to recognize the opportunities that they found, but were simply unwilling to admit that the eventual competition meant that they couldn't get annual returns of 40% forever without a completely different approach.This book also explains very complicated finance in a manner I found helpful. If you're interested in LTCM or Wall Street, this book is a safer investment of your money than even U.S. treasuries."
3,A late book on an interestring topic,"""When Genius Failed"" is an interesting account of the rise and fall of LTCM Hedge Fund. There are three weaknesses about this book - one, it is too late about something that happened in 1998 - two, it does not descibe well the strategies adopted by LTCM and - three INVENTING MONEY by Nicholas Dunbar is a much better book on the topic.However, it can be a good collection who is deeply interested in the LTCM."
4,very well written tale of LTCM; bad Kindle version,"This is a very engaging telling of the story of the failure of Long Term Capital Management, which is a tale of the hubris of intellect, although Lowenstein in postscript attempts to make it into a failure of capitalism or the lack of regulation. While one may disagree with his conclusion, his perspective does not interfere with a clear and interesting statement of the facts. This is an important read on the problems with Wall Street today and with a government that bails out those who should go down in flames.The Kindle version of this book is very poor, however. The footnotes are not hyperlinked and the notes page is not separately indexed, making the footnotes of practically no use on a Kindle."
4,Great Moments of Behavioral Theory,"Its a great review of a collective of successful traders and very bright individuals (some are Nobel Laureates) who prove that under a lot of stress and pressure can easily fall victim to many of the behavioral errors and biases that are common in decision making. No matter how bright or talented an individual is, they are not above these human errors.This book is well written and is worth not just one, but many readings!!Mark Shore is Chief Investment Officer of Shore Capital Management LLC www.shorecapmgmt.com.He has contributed chapters to Wiley books on hedge funds and commodities."
5,A must-read for anybody considering hedge funds,"If you are considering hedge funds because you think they are safer than other investments, read this book and then think again. Long-Term Capital Management combined the best and brightest of the financial world to cook up a financial folly that almost left the rest of our gooses cooked (only last-second intervention by the Fed prevented a second Great Depression)."
3,Slightly Disappointing,"This is a good book, but it's not as good by any means as the same author's Warren Buffett biography, or more important, it's nowhere near as good as Nicholas Dunbar's Inventing Money, also about LTCM. The problem is that the author, although in fairness he probably does understand the arcana that made up LTCM's strategies, does not have the fluency in the language required to explain them to the reader. Dunbar, on the other hand, deals thoroughly with all the background and history in a way I found quite remarkable in its lucidity. Lowenstein's approach is too journalistic and insufficiently rigorous to do justice to a fascinating subject. By all normal standards, this is a good story well told. Unfortunately for Lowenstein, someone else was writing the same book at the same time, and doing a much better, in fact an outstanding job."
3,A decent chronicle of LTCM's fall,"This book is a pretty good telling of the story of LTCM's rise and fall. It is heavy on the personalities, and light on the technical factors involved with the failure. There are some attempts at describing the complex trades and markets, but they usually leave you wanting more. The author is quite judgemental, oversimplifying the matter by placing blame on the traders and investors who are described as greedy, egotistical, and pretty-much dumb for missing the obvious fallacy of their strategies. It's an interesting book though, and gives a lot of insight into the thinking of the people involkved"
4,Fun for everyone...,"This is a fascinating book about the collapse of one of the largest and most sophisticated hedge funds of all time. The book gives great insight to the hedge fund world, as run by Nobel prize winners and other mathematical geniuses, without being technical. Anyone with a passing interest in the world of finance is likely to enjoy this book."
1,Disappointing Half-Story,"This book was a truly disappointing, disjointed, and ill-informed attempt at telling what should have been a riveting tale. It is obvious that the author does not understand much of the subject matter of the book. He totally mischaracterizes the role of derivatives traders/providers. For instance, he focuses exclusively on the risk side of an equity put seller, without recognizing that this is merely a risk transference from the put buyer. He gets some elementary points backwards, as in the time where LTCM is short volatility and, in an effort to cover, solicits other Wall Street firms to provide bids--it should have been offers.Most disconcerting was that it was obvious that most of the players involved refused to talk to the author, forcing him to piece together a half-story from a handful of sources who would talk to him, various newstories of the time, and his own Buffett book. Perhaps no one will ever have the complete story of what happened. This book clearly doesn't."
3,"Worth reading, but not that much","I'm not a technical expert and I can't make any statements on whether Mr. Lowenstein's accuracy regarding details on the subject. A lot of things made sense to me though, i.e. that could be true. So, as a non technical person, I tried to focus on the analysis of the people involved in the case (the human factor), and that part of the book is worth reading.On the other hand, I know a couple of people that actually lived the rise and fall of LTCM (working in other companies) and I have even seen some of the people mentioned in the book in person (talking to these people I know). My ""sources"" say that I should consider about 50% of the book as an accurate story. The other half is probably made of legends and wrong information. I trust my ""sources"" and that's why I gave just 3 stars to this book. It's not that good but it's a nice read."
5,"Great Read, Well Written","This book was a great read, well written, and hard to put down. Highly recommend."
5,When Genius Failed,This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in understanding how wallstreet functions.
3,Never Equate a Nobel Prize with Common Sense,"As a former professional options and mortgage-backed securities trader on Wall Street I found this book highly amusing. For those who know nothing about derivatives it is probably an easy read. For those who know the derivative markets it is tedious at times. It's the story itself and the well researched details that are most interesting, from the imbicillic bankers that bent over backwards to do business with LTCM to the colorful LTCM team; JM and his old Salomon wunderkinds and the brilliant (ha!) Merton and Scholes. To think this den of fools actually believed that their models were infallable (and these models were greatly flawed in terms of a true understanding of volatility)is not only irresponsible but incomprehensible to any technical trader. I loved this book for once again it proves the words of John Kenneth Galbraith: ""There is far more money flowing into the markets than there is intelligence to guide it""."
5,Great account of flawed genius,"An easy to read narrative of the rise and spectacular collapse of LTCM. Lowenstein provides a good balance between the technical aspects of LTCM's trades and the more human aspects of the story. The secret of their success was the use of excessive leverage to boost otherwise ordinary returns (supposedly 1% per annum on an unlevered basis) and the ability to keep costs down by dazzling their counterparties with their brains and size. In the end though, greed and stubborness dragged them down as they ventured into markets where their ""arbitrage"" strategies were less effective, and ardent belief in efficient markets failed to predict the scale of market moves seen in 1998.A great read for anyone interested in markets, and useful reminder that brains alone can never bring riches (that last!)"
1,Don't waste your time,"I run a hedge fund named Promethean Fund, LP.Do yourselves a favor and don't read this book.Arrogance, the belief that prices always return to some mean, managers who are out of touch with their customers needs, wealthy people who throw money at Wall Street wizards is a tale you should miss.Go for Harry Potter instead. Understand that the first chapter is a downer!"
4,Perfect example of real life not fitting into a model,"Obviously the credentials of this team SHOULD have made success and riches a given. However, Wall St. respects no one thought or theory and will eventually weed out everyone. The trick is not to put all your eggs in one basket and leverage it 30x. The disection of LTCM's trades were interesting but the true wisdom in this book is hidden in the fact that nothing ever works exactly according to models. You must be willing to be humble and know when to walk away from an idea. Overall, interesting book, interesting trade and great lessons to be learned."
4,required reading,"Although a bit dry, this is a very informative book. I would recommend it to anyone with investments, as it describes what really happens behind closed doors. Further, it gives insight into the delicate nature of our financial system."
5,Timeless Lessons Easily Forgotten,"Roger Lowenstein is one of today's most insightful business journalists, and his reputation is enhanced by this engrossing account of Long-Term Capital Management's stunning rise and precipitous fall. The LTCM debacle underscores the continuing truth of time-honored financial aphorisms: the perils of unchecked leverage, the need for true diversification, and, most important, the foolhardiness of projecting recent historical precedent indefinitely into the future. Worthy reading for investors both novice and professional."
3,Glaring error,"Overall interesting read, however I'm surprised and disappointed by Mr. Lowenstein and his staff in their incorrect reference to insurance/financial services giant American International Group (AIG) as American Insurance Group."
5,One of the best books I've read,"The book is a thorough account on what happened at LTCM. Absolutely fantastic writing skills. What I liked the most though is how Goldman came on top as usual :-) Interesting, hein? Goldman is amazing."
5,Markets are not science,"Not a light read, but a captivating one - in part reads like a horror story where you're dragged into a sequence of events both exciting in their nature and progression, and epic in their ultimate failure. I'm not a finance type, but Roger Lowenstein did a great job of explaining how the hedge fund operated, and the types of trades it was involved in. It certainly throws a bucket of cold water on Econometrics, and demonstrates that beyond a certain point, economics is as much of an art, as it is a science."
4,This is a great resource,"If you are doing Christian Financial counseling, or just interested in biblical financial principles, this book is a must. Larry Burkett has laid this book out to be an excellent reference with biblical references for each topic."
1,What on Earth is he thinking?!?,"Utter hogwash.War is violence with a purpose not a physical phenomenon that burns itself out like a forest fire. The function of every war is not to bring peace but to acheive specific political objectives (cf. Clausewitz). If you intervene in a war, you are not interrupting some chemical reaction. You are acting politically to alter the course of the conflict: perhaps saving lives, perhaps not; perhaps helping to bring about a peaceful solution to the conflict, perhaps not.I'd like to see how ""logical"" Luttwak would be if it was his family and town that was being subjected to sustained genocidal attack. The clue to all this is his view that ""other peoples' wars"" should be allowed to run their course. You cannot but conclude that ""other people"" are not quite like him..."
3,Lowepro 32 Capacity CD/DVD Case,"Pros: The case is durable, stylish, and, has plenty of cd storage space.Cons: Belt clip is not a clip-on syle, which makes it inconvenient for quick removal. The elastic bands, that secure the external player to the case, definitely do a good job of holding the player in place, but, their triangular arrangement limits access to player operating function buttons.For the price, it's about what I expected."
4,SOME CLASSIC UPBEAT RAP,"This album is a classic 'friendly rap'...it has tonnes of upbeat tunes, and contains classics such as ' me, meself & I'.To me this rap is a playful rap and not on the same level of expression as rappers such as 2PAC and N.W.A, but it contains catchy beats and tunes. Many of these songs sound similar though.Ideal rap when you want to escape from all the modern rubbish and just 'absorb' the music."
1,A waste of time.,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! I think a grade school audio/visual club could do a better job.
5,The Asian Trilogy,"What an amazing collection of Asian-based stories, so real one would have to believe that there is more truth and fact in these books, than fiction. Kerry Collison provides us with a delightful insight into Asian protocols, and the murky depths of the shadowy world of spies and intrigue. I have learned a great deal from these three titles and look forward to reading the author's ""The Fifth Season"". Stephen Coleman"
1,Waste of money! Get it free on internet,"I bought this hoping I would get the tables that are omitted from the internet articles but they are missing here as well. Don't waste your money, just google it and read it for free. :- ( So much for trust. I am so disappointed to be ripped off like this even though it was only $6."
2,limited instructions and poor fitting parts,"I was happy to pay a little more for this wheelbarrow to have it delivered, since I don't have a car. The directions were limited, but sufficient. However, the provided parts did not line up with one of the pre-drilled holes, stripping one of the bolts. I couldn't arrange the parts in any different configuration and, with the limited instructions, could not see any other way to configure the parts."
3,Not precision engineering,"Difficult to assemble, parts don't exactly line up, and the plastic bin doesn't help with assembly. The nose guard is bulkier than it needed to be and seems to always be in the way in tighter spaces. Functional"
1,absolute garbage,"After very limited use with grass clippings, mulch, and top soil, the bottom spit! When filled 3/4 with top soil it bends and shifts side to side. Very poor engineering, very poor construction. Should be pulled off the market! Shame on you True Temper!"
1,DO NOT BUY,The Ames True Temper Poly wheelbarrow made in China is toxic.The seriously chemical smell was immediately noticeable. I left all the parts outside to air out thinking that smell would dissipate . I then put it together and started using it thinking time would help . The smell makes you sick and even when I took it out of my car the toxic chemical smell remained. I will try to return it but more importantly I am concerned that other people will buy this product because the price is so good and therefore be exposed to harmful toxic fumes.
3,Mixed review,"I read this book from cover to cover expecting to find a moving novel that delivered insight to the dark times of Argentina's Dirty War. I did find some of that, but before getting through the third chapter I became distracted by the confused delivery of the tale itself. I myself was not confused, but the story takes turns and back tracks without explanation or warning. Loose ends were left hanging everywhere. There were quite a few disjointed ideas. Confusion came across in other ways as well which leads me to believe that imprisonment left the character with deep-rooted issues that she could not face or acknowledge."
5,Love this clock!,"My husband and I bought this clock after seeing one similar to it at his parents' house. My 2 year old son loved the songs on the other clock, prompting us to find one.The appearance of the clock is very nice, and the colors are not too flashy, which we like. Also, the songs that it plays are very nice, and are a decent length.Most importantly, my son loves the clock. He loves to press the button to hear the songs/chime, and stops in his tracks at the top of every hour.I recommend this clock if you are wanting a Melodies in Motion clock, but don't want to fork out the hundreds of dollars for one."
2,NO tech support available for Retrospect,"The Maxtor hard drive installed without a problem but the documentation for the Retrospect backup software is thin - at best. When I had tech support questions and tried calling and e-mailing for assistance, I was told that they are closed for three days because they are moving offices. This is BACKUP software not a video game. My computer is down and I need assistance to get it back up. This is unacceptable when it comes to restoring a user's ability to use their system.I've received better tech support for my Playstation for pete's sake. Only buy this product if you don't need any support."
3,Data (and drive) salvage may be possible,"I was on the verge of abandoning hope of seeing my data again, so I decided to tear the unit apart. Unlike in my younger days, when such an effort would have ended in the emergency room, I was careful not to gouge myself with the small screwdriver. After getting the plastic stips off of the sides, the unit practically fell apart, revealing an ordinary Maxtor internal drive. I placed the drive in my PC, hooked it up to an available connector on the DVD writer ribbon, attached power, and my data was back."
3,software doesn't work,"I've just read the previous 9 reviews and they certainly differ. There is one constant, however - the so called ""one-touch backup"" doesn't work. The hardware has worked OK for me so far and I was contemplating buying another identical drive, but I can't seem to find one in a retail store, which may mean that Maxtor is pulling them because of problems. I only use mine for backup, but if there is any chance of mechanical failure I will probably replace it."
2,Mediocre performance,"My favorite of this CD is BWV 546 which I believe can reveal an organist's strenths and weaknesses. Frankly, Rubsam is not near the caliber of world class organists like Daniel Roth, Olivier Latry or Sophie-Marie Choplin. Ms Choplin has a rendition of BWV 546 on YouTube that is superb, not only in the rendition of that work but the registry she selected on that great organ at St Sulpice. Rubsam, by comparison plods through this great work with an uninspired registry that fails to bring out the greatness of this work of Bach's."
2,Not as good as I hoped for,"I read other reviews for this product and felt pretty good about ordering it. Service was great, no problems at all with the vendor. I followed the instructions to try it on over something else in case it needed to be returned and it fit fine in terms of size. But in actual use it was very disappointing and did not hide as I hoped it would. It may work for others based on their reviews but it doesn't make things disappear for me."
2,"Nick, I'm very dissappointed","I only bought this CD because it was a compilation of tracks selected by Chicane - and the only good tracks were the one's BY chicane. Do you think that Nick was trying to emphasize how awesome his own music is by contrasting it with garbage? If he was then he has prooven his point. Nick you ARE the man, but you didn't have to make me buy this peice of =\*%."
4,loved it!,This is the first Nancy Thayer book I read and was hooked immediately. I could relate to the descriptions of exultant friendship and the loss when that friendship comes to an end. I also loved that Daphne stays postive right to the end inspite of all the tough choices she has to make.
5,I Love Nancy Thayer,"I just finished reviewing one of the author's latest works - Heat Wave: a novel and I mentioned this book in that review. This is one of my favorite Nancy Thayer books. It has a few twists and unexpected turns as you delve into Daphne's past & present and though you can see where the story is going, you can't stop rooting for her. I was glad to see her resist Jack's overtures yet understood why things continued on as they did (I don't want to give much away). Daphne was a delightful heroine - sweet yet savvy, articulate, beautiful yet not the typical heroine beautiful. Daphne's not a skinny little thing - she's got curves (not obesity) & learns to be proud of her body. She loves her daughter and though my daughters were young when I first read it, I got a look at the complicated relationship that was to come (it did).I wholeheartedly recommend this book. I wish it was available on kindle but am happy to see that it's available for pennies as long as one buys used."
5,Beatiful trio sonatas,"This is the second album of trio sonatas played by the same grouping, The liner notes give a description of the trio sonata. This CD like the other one contains both familiar and unfamiliar composers. Even the lesser known composers are highly tuneful with very moving slow sections like Capelli whose was so moving that it brought tears to my eyes as well as Handel's. I would recommend this CD to anyone interested in Baroque music.."
4,Another Tanizaki Junichiro classic,"I have been a fan of Tanizaki Junichiro for years and Diary of a Mad Old Man is definitely his masterpiece. An intriguing novel, Tanizaki digs deep into the psyhce of an old (Japanese) man and his battle/duel within himself - psychologically, spiritually, and sexually - and with a young female companion. The length of the book is quite deceiving -- it is incredibly ""deep"" and insightful. A definite reading pleasure."
5,Breathtaking!,WOW! Her voice is SO beautiful! How can a beautiful woman such as Fleming be blessed with such a voice? God gave her most precious gifts and she presents them here in full bloom! Brava!
1,Mannered singing by overrated soprano,"Renée Fleming sings a bad ""Sempre libera"" complete with mannerisms. Her ""Casta diva"" is too slow and studied. Her ""Ne andrò lontana"" is unidiomatic. She changes ""Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5"" into a jazzy vocalise that is not appropriate. I don't even recognize Villa-Lobos writing for the voice in her version. I think she changed some of the vocal lines. If she did, shame on her."
2,I'm not impressed,"Renee Fleming is arguably one of the greatest sopranos of the 21st Century. However, I'm disappointed in this disc. It is a compilation of previously released materials with three new recordings on it. One of them is Violetta's Act I aria from ""La Traviata,"" which is too fussy, with way too many liberties taken. Whoever conducted it should know not to let her get away with overmannered singing. She possess a fine instrument, but if you are going to buy any of her albums, get the ""Signatures"" album that she recorded with Solti, ""Visions of Love"" (she is to die for with Mozart), the ""Strauss Four Last Songs"" with Eschenbach, and the full set of ""Rusalka"" (probably one of the best recordings of the entire opera)."
2,Classical Music is not Jazz,"Fleming says she has a Jazz background. Now she is trying to do jazzy stuff to her La Traviata and everything else. It is very annoying. Come on, everybody knows she has a beautiful voice and can sing high notes and trill beautifully. That's not what people complain about."
4,"mostly pop, but don't miss the rainstorm","It's mostly contemporary Brazilian pop songs, done extremely well. The melodies are catchy and instantly hummable. This is not remixed music with thumping bass 'four on the floor' for dancing, though most of it does use drum machines (tastefully). Most of it is mid-tempo. All lyrics included (in Portuguese).Most of the tracks do not have a distinctly Brazilian musical flavor. The two that do are my favorite cuts. On #3 she is backed by samba percussion and sings an 'old-style' Brazilian MPB-type of song. On the last song, it's just her wonderful voice singing a sweet melody a cappella against a faux rainstorm (with birds). Beautifully simple and captivating, especially after 10 pop songs."
3,"Goopy, but a nice voice","Super-slick, ornately produced soft soul that follows the template set by other Brazilian pop-soul artists. Not my cup of tea, but fans of Marisa Monte and Bebel Gilberto will probably want to check this out."
3,Hope the next ones get better.,I was interested in starting this series because I have heard that a lot of people like it. I know as in a lotof series the first book is a little slow. That is the case with this book. Although I do not want to give away the plotyou need to start out with this book so you get to know Jack. It does tell about his background. So on that note if you arestarting the series and want to continue reading about Jack start out here and go on. I will be purchasing the second book andlet you know about that one.
2,Written for dummies,"The plot was so predictable, the characters were so flat, and the writing style is for dummies. Why would anyone recommend this book or this author when there are so many who are better."
5,I am getting into the Jack Reacher thing!,"Well written; glad there are another 8 or 9 in the series to enjoy. I know I am getting into this late, but hey if you have not read the series and like interesting super agent type reads, this was great"
4,Classic page turner,"Haven't seen the movie, but the ads inspired this purchase and I wasn't disappointed in a classic page turner. Looking forward to more in the series."
4,A great introduction to Jack Reacher and Lee Child,"I bought this book following the recent Jack Reacher movie with Tom Cruise. The book is an enjoyable read and is far more engaging than the movie.On the positive side, the action is reasonably fast paced and the book is an easy read. Reacher's character is probably difficult for the average person to relate to, but I seemed to draw a connection nonetheless. There are some twists and turns and I found it difficult to put the book down until it was completed. However, once the plot starts to play out the ending becomes predictable. All in all a fun way to occupy a quiet afternoon or two."
4,Fun Read,This is the first of Lee Child's Reacher novels so I am assuming that his style and development of the character will improve with time. That is not to say that this is not an entertaining read but the plot and characters come off as not quite genuine enough. In my opinion this is worth the price of admission for being entertaining and informative. I hope the next Reacher novels I read improve in the areas I mentioned.
5,Great read,Could not put it down. This is the second Jack Reacher book I read. Can' wait to read the rest of them
3,Decent Book,Very easy reading when you have 5 minutes spare. No real surprises in the plot. Something good to past the time but not life changing.
5,Amazing,"I have often longed for the perfect action movie, and action novel. Somehow the main characters always feel soft to me and leave me desiring something more. To be honest I want a brutal main character who can be extremely violent, but also isn't a total wimp when a woman comes into the picture. For me Taken is the epitome of my perfect action movie. The Killing Floor is my perfect action novel. I've been hesitant to read Child's series because it's a commitment to read 12 books (although I'll skip Nothing to Lose)...choosing to read around this novel. I enjoyed Eisler's John Rain, but Jack Reacher would break his liberal neck and Child would continue his reign as one of (and for me THE) best fiction writers out there. Good show. HIGHLY recommended."
4,Couldn't put it Down!,This was my first Jack Reacher novel and what can I say but I'm hooked! I found it very interesting and very difficult to put down. I now have the complete Jack Reacher series in my possession and plan to continue to enjoy the series.
4,Killing fields,stretching and easily to read readingJack Reachers adventures are just as good as this from James Bond I look forward already to the next book
5,Killing Floor,"I read a Jack Reacher novel years ago - somewhere in the middle of the series. I enjoyed it then, so decided to start at the beginning and work my way through the series. This first novel had hints of the first Rambo movie - or maybe it was the other way round - a stranger in town being targeted. It was fast paced and most enjoyable to read. There is mystery, action, a hero who is a little different, a very good plot and lots of excitement. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have already read the next in the series and am looking to read the third."
5,Jack Reacher is a fascinating character!,"I read this book several years ago and recently bought it in the kindle version for a friend. I love this series so much, that I just had to introduce it to a friend. I knew he would love it as well. Jack Reacher is a really fascinating character that you find out about a little at a time in each book. These books are fast paced. You find Reacher an interesting character that surprisingly gets out of the worst situations. And best of all, he fights for the underdog. He gets involved in issues and situations that need a man like him to help resolve. I'm really looking forward to the upcoming movie based on this character, though I must admit that I would never have seen Tom Cruise as playing this character. Tom simply can't physically match the character who is 6'5"" and 250 lbs. Let's hope Tom can sell it! Read this series, you won't regret it!"
3,Average read.,After ploughing through the Vince Flynn 'Mitch Rapp' series I was underwhelmed with the introduction to 'Jack Reacher.' Killing Floor moves fairly well but Jack doesn't have the same bad boy spunk as Mitch.
4,KILLING FLOOR by Lee Child,"This book is the first in a series starring Jack Teacher. It is written in short declarative sentences. Just like this review is written. Some people have complained about this, but I feel that this style fits the personality of Reacher.For readers who love action and a pretty good mystery this book would be right up their alley. Child keeps you turning the pages and wanting more. He's created an American James Bond, albeit one who is much more rough around the edges.In some ways he's a Bond mixed with a modern day Mike Hammer.There are a couple of"
4,Action Packed,"This was a good story. I figured would check it out due to new movie coming out. It had an interesting plot and the main character was believable not in a Hollywood movie way. Essentially, estranged brothers. Jack ends up in a town by happenstance and becomes the fall guy for two murders that had happened. Ex army police, he uses his skills to try to point lead investigator to look at who actually might have killed the men. Then he comes to find out one of the dead men is his brother. The whole inquiry takes on deadly overtones when he starts looking into why his brother was there and it having to do with his job. Fast paced and unique plot with plenty of bad guys to go around. Will look at his other books."
4,Watch,"Great story telling, you can watch the action and imagine the characters in detail. Excellent book, just simply could not put it down."
4,First Rate,Jack Reacher is someone that one should never get on the bad side of. Great action.I kept wanting more and more.
3,Action! Murder! Counterfeiting!,"Just like the movies, this novel unrolls intensely, with the hero (Jack Reacher) not sure at first how he got involved in this small town's drama, then learning his own brother is one of the many gruesomely murdered. Takes a while to figure out who all the bad guys are and why the local citizens just seem to exist as if on the drug, Soma. A fast read, snappy dialogue, vivid descriptions of action."
4,"Ridiculous and predictable, but very entertaining","It's a good ol' page-turner, with a likable, remorseless anti-hero killing machine, a black-and-white good vs. evil world, where the good guy gets his hands dirty, the bad guys die violent, horrible deaths, and a lot of the twists are easy to figure out.I'd call it a good 1980's action movie type of book. I'll read more Jack Reacher, simply because it was entertaining, but don't go in expecting Steinbeck."
4,Like it,Jack does it again. Plenty of action from the outset that sets the mood and the rest of the book does not disappoint. Good yarn with an interesting twist that gives the plot substance and makes it believable.
1,"Writing short, choppy","I decided to read the book before I saw the movie. I was disappointed with the short, choppy sentences and waiting for the author to tie everything together as the story went along. I won't be reading any more from this author."
5,Book,This was a very good book at a great price and I also appreciate a quick shipment. Thanks very much!
3,mediocre,"The simplicity of the writing style becomes tedious while the plot, although relatively engrossing and encompassing an interesting concept, tends to follow a formula."
5,Reacher is a really intriguing character,"A number of people have recommended this author to me, knowing that I enjoy reading mysteries and suspense novels. So, I read this book, the first in the series featuring Jack Reacher, an ex-military policeman who is now a drifter. Reacher is a really intriguing character and the details provided in this book about currency and counterfeiting were also fascinating. I definitely plan to continue reading the other books in this series."
3,Not Bad,"I enjoyed The Killing Floor. The main character--Jack Reacher--is a military police officer rifted after spending most of his life serving his country. He copes by hitting the road and ends up in a small Georgia town near Atlanta. He is falsely accused of murder and ends up attempting to solve the case, uncovering a nefarious enterprise run by a sadistic man and his son that involves a whole town. Reacher's motivation for being co-opted to solve the case are 1) his affection for a sexy deputy and 2) a coincidence that is so impossible that it almost made me stop reading the book altogether...you'll find out what it is if you read the book.The book is a fun mystery to follow for the most part and the author's writing is, at times, poetic without being sappy. If you can suspend you disbelief on a couple of key elements of the plot, you will enjoy this fast-paced read. If you are apt to question far-fetched plot twists, I'd pass on this book."
3,Killing Floor,"This is my first Lee Child book, that I have read. It took me awhile to get into it. I did finish it, but it wasn't as exciting as some of the books that I've read, like John Sandford's books. It did get more interesting toward the end, Lee Child kept repeating different things about his brother, etc. (to monotomous)"
4,More personal info on Reacher,"Even though I grumble when action movies or 'tough shows' like Law & Order lapse into what I consider to be soap opera (what artistes call 'character development'), I must confess that I LOVED learning more about Reacher's brother. He's a less huge, more thoughtful version of Reacher, a well dressed treasury agent. I don't think I'm giving away the plot to tell you that the murder victim early in the book is Reacher's brother.Maybe Lee Child will write another book that's a retrospective with more about Reacher's brother? I also liked the book with Reacher's mother and brother in it. Maybe I like character development?The plot is pretty interesting and once explained, I thought ""aha!"" which is good! The best plots are ones that are completely credible yet intriguing."
3,Simple Solution,Problem: One ex-military policeman decides to deal with a gang of vicious murdering criminals.Answer: Kill them all.
5,First Reacher book.,"As the author develops the persona of the character, it makes you wonder if this is going to be a book you are really interested in. Trust me, you will be"
3,Not really my type of book,"I purchased the book because of the recent movie release about Jack Reacher, and was curious. I really was not impressed, but I suspect it is because this is not the type of book I really enjoy. I found it a little too violent for my personal taste, and the book seemed slow at the start. For those who like this genre, I am sure they will have a different review. This is simply my taste in books that prompts this review. The one thing I must say is that Lee Child does know how to write."
3,Lackluster,"""The Killing Floor"" is Lee Child's first Jack Reacher novel, and it shares the attention to detail and meticulous research that has made the better Jack Reacher novels such compelling reads. Unfortunately, Lee Child chooses to write the novel in first-person, and it's hard to identify with a 6 foot four killing machine, and I found myself skimming through this predictable and shallow novel."
5,A great book,"A very good read lots a action, I'm hooked can't wait too start the next book. Lee Child is a great writer"
4,Action Packed Book,Killing Floor is certainly action packed and grabbed my attention quickly. My main complaint is that the final confrontation was over way too fast for my taste.
2,Mike didn't like this. Thought it was bad. Real bad.,"Mike's been told that Lee Child rocks. He was misinformed. Lee Child doesn't rock. Far from it. At best, he's a poor man's Elmore Leonard, without the snappy dialogue. At best. If that. Child writes in choppy sentences. Like this. Supposed to convey a sense of urgency I guess. Kind of Hemingwayesque I guess. Or maybe Chandleresque. Mike doesn't know. Or care. This is bad writing, cheesy as hell. Cheesy. As hell."
1,Pure Trash,"I'll admit that I read this book coming off of reading David Copperfield; however, reading this book was PURE AGONY! The characters are cardboard, the plot is hackneyed and the violence is gratuitous. At only one place did the book bacome even moderately human, and even that part was spoiled by the author's twisting it back into the main (thin) plot. If you believe that this Jack Reacher guy is anything like the stereotype of a John Wayne character, forget it. Again, the plot is poorly contrived, the characters are cardboard and the writing is terrible. I would be hard pressed to purchase another Lee Child book!"
1,"Good atmos, appalling ""hero""!","I was really looking forward to this, going through a phase of thrillers set in the Deep South, and it started well. Unfortunately the ""hero"", Jack Reacher, turns out to be one of those heroes who I loathe - inflicting all manner of barbarity upon the opposition but, hey, that's okay because he's on the side of ""good"", and lets us know it throughout - barbaric heroes - another Jack, Carter, springs to mind - are ok but hypocritical ones are not.This, for me, rendered the book uncompletable since I ended up wanting the villians to win, which would never happen.1-star and that's just for some good descriptions of the general atmosphere and the town."
2,Reacher begins,"Jack Reacher begins a career of sticking up for the innocent and righting wrongs.This is the man that James F. Cooper was written about in the Deer Slayer, and Louie L'Amour found on the plains of America.John"
3,Did not care for sentence structure,I liked the book well enough but I was not comfortable with the sentence structure. The story was good and the characters were interesting. But I can't say if I would buy another book because of the too short sentences just don't sound right
3,Shrugged,"Holy 'shrugged' batman. He must have said 'shrugged' 300 times in this one. He shrugged, she shrugged, it shugged....the gas station shrugged...the freaking birds in the trees shrugged. He should have named this one 'shrugging on the killing floor'. By the end of the book I could not get past it. It really was edited very poorly...too bad too, the book was very good, especially for a first time author.cool use of violence though. 3 stars."
1,"Paid for NEW, received USED","I purchased a NEW book and to my chagrin, when the giftee opened up the box, it contains a USED book. Had a label on the back that said it was Used, in good condition. If the book was not available New, I shouldn't have been charged full price..."
4,Killing Floor,Was a great book from start to finish.Not a dull moment.Kept me in and very interested right from the start with a few good twists and turns along the way.
2,Not The Best,"I really like the Lee Child's Jack Reacher books, but this was the least likable of the many that I read."
3,Requires a health suspension of disbelief,"I needed a fun read for a vacation. This served the purpose. It does require that you believe two government investigators can go missing/be murdered, but the FBI and state police won't get involved in the investigation (cause they weren't asked), leaving the investigation it in the hands of a podunk police department - with the help of Mr. Reacher. The premise also requires that you believe in coincidence. But Child has a good writing style and he keeps you in the book with a nice progression of mysteries revealed and action. He doesn't drag out action sequences too long. Overall, a good light read. I will likely turn to Reacher/Child again for some ""escape"" reading."
3,Not too bad back in 1997,"The story, style and even technology are bit old fashioned. Checked the publish date, back in 1997. No wonder. A good book for entertaining."
4,A good quick read,"There were a couple of technical plot holes that no one except someone from the inside would notice, but all in all, a GREAT read. Fast paced and fun. I'll read more by this author for sure."
3,It is okay,I liked the book okay but there are several parts that seemed a little far out there. One guy against almost the whole police force set in the south like small town southern town police are mostly bad. I would believe clique'ish is more like.
5,good read,I am hooked on Jack Reacher series now. I plan to real all of them. Skip the movie and read the books.
2,Slow Read,"This is my first Jack Reacher experience. My husband recommended that I read it since I like the Alex Cross series. BUT, the read is way to slow and Lee Child's writing style places too much on character and situation development. Too boring and I never finished. I have no desire to finish because I'm don't find Reacher all that interesting. Maybe I'll try another one-- we'll see."
3,"Predictable plot, a bit lengthy","I read this book on a recommendation, and was both disappointed and satisfied. I had two issues with the book. First, the book starts on a pretty unreasonable coincidence, which the plot relies on. And while the plot is pretty thin, it took the characters most of the book to figure it out. I made an educated guess halfway through about the plot, and was a little bit disappointed that there was not a twist in the end. Secondly, the author likes to describe in detail what the characters are doing. Which could be interesting, but gets repetitive after a while.On the whole, this is a decent read. But don't expect it to be anything like the Reacher movie."
3,Just Ok,I bought this book after the movie came out. I kept hearing how good the movie is which usually means the book should be much better. I was disappointed. It took me so long to get through the book. It felt like it dragged and dragged. I think David Baldacci's John Puller series is so much better than Reacher.
4,Good start for Mr. Child but as one could suspect he gets much better in his later titles,I really like the main character Jack Reacher. This is a convoluted story but Jack finally figures it out after a lot of blood is spilled. Read it and I'm sure you will want to continue to read Lee Child.
5,"Start reading Jack Reacher Novel Now, starting with number1","I first started reading Jack Reacher novels a year ago, when I got my first Kindle . This is one of the best mystery series I have ever read. Lee Child has a writing style like Robert Parker, Robert Pronzini and Lawrence Block. ; all of those authors combine great plot, compelling characters and deliberate diction that keeps you turning every page. I would highly recommend that you read every novel in the Jack Reacher series-- you will not be disppointed."
4,Pretty good,"For the most part, it was exciting. I think they took some liberties with Reachers deductive reasoning but overall a good read"
5,Awesome read,"Love Jack Reacher!!!! Didn't want to put it down. Love the mix of mystery, and military. On my sixth Reacher novel now!!!!!"
4,"Introducing Jack Reacher..,..","Lee Child introduces us to his new he-man hero, Jack Reacher. Jack is savvy, street smart and tough as nails. If violence and gore are your thing, here it is! If a macho hero, able to one-up bad guys at every turn is your thing, here it is.Child is an excellent writer, able to convey moods, pressures, doubts with well chosen smooth-flowing prose. The gore, to me, was over the top but I still plan to read the next one in the Reacher series."
4,"Good story, graphic violence","Mr Child came highly recommended by our parents so we decided to start at the top of the novel list with The Killing Floor. Child's storytelling and characterization of Jack Reacher did not disappoint but, while we are not delicate flowers by any stretch of the imagination, the gory details of the violence in the story seemed abrupt and borderline disturbing. While this aspect did a good job of further villifying the bad guys, we hope that it gets tamed down in subsequent novels. We were very pleased with all other aspects of the book."
2,Review,Too much violence and I only read it because it was our book club book and I won't buy or read any more
3,"Review of the ""Killing Floor"" by Lee Child","I read this book to see how well Jack Reacher stacks up against M. Connelly'sHarry Bosch mystery series. The plot was believable and technically correct in basic counterfeiting of currency and methods used to prevent it. It became a bit far fetched when trying to explain how an entire town could be corrupted into going along with its unexplained prosperity and that of it's residents.As a first novel in this series. it was interesting enough to come back for more, I expect there will be improvement in later Jack Reacher novels which apparently only now becoming popular after starting out 15 years ago."
2,Not what I thought,I see they are making a move of the Jack Reacher character. That may be watchable - this book was too hard to read - being slow and too descriptive to keep up with the plot.
1,This was the first and will be the last 'Jack Reacher' for me,"The worst rubbish I have ever set eyes on in my many years of reading; don't waste your money!!!Oh well, we learn from our mistakes, hopefully!!"
2,A Major Disappointment,"What a major let down. The main character, Jack Reacher, is superhuman. He can do anything - including destroying the bad guys - no matter what. Thank God for all that militiary training;otherwise poor Jack would never be able to kill all those bad guys. It takes no effort to ice four,five,six slugs all at once and then return to his lover's arms for a little TLC."
5,ANOTHER REACHER SPECIAL,I HAVE READ ALL OF THE JACK REACHER SERIES ANDHAVE REALLY ENJOYED THEM. I LIKE THE ACTION AND THESTORY LINES. KEEP ON WRITNG THEM.
2,Overly flaws,"The book's scam was really good. The problem was that you'll have to trawl it away from more than 400 pages.The way Jack found Hubble was overly far-fetched. I mean the way he explained to him why he thought he was in that specific city, in that specific hotel with that specific name.The love story was pathetic. A female officer just smitten with the supposedly killer.The 20 years' veteran cop that does not know what to do with a phone number just because is a cell.And I can keep writing on and on."
1,Just terrible,"Funnily enough, I read this book because it was mentioned in reviews of David Baldacci's Zero Day. Many claimed that David Baldacci ripped this book off in Zero Day, using the same type of hero, similar writing style, similar plot, etc.That may be true.However, I can say with authority that David Baldacci's grocery list is probably better written than this book. This book is terribly written! What are people thinking? Cardboard characters, unrealistic dialogue, ridiculous romance - this book has it all.As others have said, the one redeeming feature is that the actual plot is interesting. In the hands of a much better writer, with complex characters and realistic dialogue, this book could have been really something. But the writing, the writing! Absolutely horrible.Stay far away! I wish I had believed the negative reviews of this book instead of the positive ones."
3,The First Not As Good As The Last,"I first read the last 3 Reacher novels (""One Shot"", ""The Hard Way"" and ""Bad Luck and Trouble"") which I thoroughly enjoyed. Then I tried ""Killing Floor"", the first of the Reacher novels and was a little disappointed. I assume it was because the character was just being developed. The plot was very choppy. I felt there were a lot of words thrown in to fill the pages but did not add to the story.I am very happy I read some of his latter works first, otherwise I might not have gone any further with Jack Reacher who I have come to enjoy."
4,a new American Writer of triller for me.,"I read a review of Mr. Child's last book in the New York Times by accident.I immediately order the first 5 books from Amazon.I have read 3 so far.I liked ""Killing Floor"" enough to read the second one as fast as possible, I am now stuck with the third book.I find the use of lurid passages of violence a bit too much.the plot is simple, the main caracter is true blue and very two dimentional.There are a number of great american and English writers in the genre that i prefer.There are no surprises, every action can be expected in advance."
2,"Jack Reacher, a new Hero",The book is very well written. Well at least for the first few pages. The idea is pretty good: J. Reacher visits a village and get's arrested for murder which he didn't commited. I do believe some people think it is an interesting read but for me it was just to unrealistic. I mean an ex-military policeman who can fight everybody and finds every clue was for me a little too herotic. A person this perfect gives me a lack of suspense. 2 stars
5,Jack Reacher 1,Great read. Could not put it down . The authors use of imagery was fantastic. I felt as if I had a front row seat watching everything unfold.
4,another hard hitter.,"Jack Reacher never stops, never backs down. You don't want this guy to not like you. You definitely want this guy on your side."
3,Enjoyable,There were a few points in the book where it felt like the author was using mysterious revelations to cover up plot holes. Overall an enjoyable read. I'm now reading the second book in the series.
4,Enjoyed the book,Good storyline. Didn't get 5 stars only because it lost my interesst when he went into the technical details and took pages to tell about the bullet between release and hiting the target. Otherwise a good read.
4,"Killing Floor Jack Reacher, NO.1",I enjoyed this book very much. I plan on reading the entire series. kept my attention and didn't want to put it down.
5,I'm Canadian and switching to KOBO,"I really enjoyed this book. This was my first Lee Child book but won't be my last. I will be reading them on Kobo however, because Kindle apps are not available in Canada."
3,I came to this book backwards...,"I admit it...I went to the movie first (what else are you going to do when it's -8 outside??). The movie was mildly diverting so I thought I would try the books, and got the first one (have to read them in order...I know, I know) Well, imagine my surprise when I discovered Jack Reacher is 6-6 and blonde, not 5-8 and dark. OK...I can get past the casting decisions, and the humor and violence were there, so I went ahead. Given this is the first book in a series and has a lot of exposition in it, it was fine. i will pick up the next couple and see where it all goes...so more, later!"
5,Killing Floor,I am reading this book now and I can hardly put it down-really interesting. But knowing Child he will get my favorite personout of trouble and clean out this messed up town.
4,Good read,"I enjoy the Jack Reacher novels. If you enjoy mysteries you may like this series. The ultimate free spirit--go where you want,stay as long as you want, and solve the mystery."
4,Jack Reacher book Killing Floor,Book arrived in good shape and on time. Can't ask for more than that. It was an exciting introduction to the character.
4,Addictive Plot,"I liked Jack, but was not crazy about any other characters. The book was hard to put down. I would definitely read more Jack Reacher novels, but hope I can find a way to give a darn about the other characters. Another thing that bothered me was that the Department of Treasury does not know where their agents are while in the field and does not investigate their murders. I did not have a problem with the violence in the book."
3,It was okay...,"I read this because of all the hoopla about the upcoming film starring the ill-cast Tom Cruise. This book, on it's own, was just okay for me. It wasn't bad; I read it all the way through. It was somewhat predictable, but not terribly. It had lots of elements that were just too... coincidental... that were necessary to move the story along. I'm not opposed to read another Reacher novel, but I'm in no hurry to do so."
4,Killing Floor,"Typical Jack Reacher novel but holds your interest from beginning to end. If you are ""into"" Lee Child's novels, this purchase is not a waste."
4,Interesting story - author needed to do a bit more research,"So far, the story is good, the writing works well, and I'm being pulled through the plot quickly. Then the information on the .22 'entry and exit wounds' came up. Here's some advice to authors - if you don't have a clue about firearms (it's a .22 caliber, not a .22 gauge for one) then find somebody who does and ask. Ok - I lost track of the number of cliche' moments in this book, and the number of inaccuracies. I will say it's a decent read in terms of grabbing the readers' attention, but I twitch every time I read something that is glaringly wrong in the details. Despite that comment, I will continue to read Lee Child's other books over time, because the man has talent."
5,Classic Jack Reacher,"I really enjoyed some of the more recent Reacher novels, so decided to go back to the beginning. Excellent story and well written."
4,Great read,"After reading One Shot recently, I decided I had to read the whole series. Killing Floor was a great read and I can't wait to get into the next book."
2,Predictable,"A nice read, but you figure out the big mystery before the main characters do. Action scenes were not very vivid. All in all, still a good read. Went by very fast. I am not sure if I will read the rest of the series. May not even see the movie now. Not a very believable hero."
3,Predictable beach read,"Fast paced, quick read, macho. This book is part of an extensive series of books using the Jack Reacher character. I was curious because of the movie starring Tom Cruise. Both the book and the movie lack any depth or plot turns that would make them truly interesting."
2,Ok,"It was okay,not horrible but really a really hard to believe kind of book. Worth reading as the beginning of a series."
4,A Great Mystery,"Good story, good characters, believable motives and action. It has a great lead character. What else do you need from a book?"
4,Good first book in series.,I thought this was a good introduction into the character and that the author combined both elements of mystery and action fairly well.
3,Gripping read with some flaws,"Written in very short sentences that make for a tense, gripping story. Jack Reacher is a hero you can cheer for in spite of his ruthlessness (against those who deserve it).However, the story dragged a bit in the middle of the book (maybe it should have been shorter), Reacher was always making accurate guesses based on insufficient data and the plot depended on several absolutely incredible coincidences."
3,A solid read,"This is a classic thriller in every sense of the word and really enjoyable. Some things annoyed the hell out of me, especially the dialogue tags. Every single line of dialogue had a tag, mostly he said, I said, he said, I said. Even when there were only two people in the scene. It drove me nuts! Also, some of Jack Reacher's clever working stuff out stretched credulity a bit too far, which was a shame. But on the whole the book was a very exciting, well researched counterfeiting thriller and I enjoyed the read."
4,Tom Cruise is not 6'4''.,I'm new to Lee Childs work. After seeing the Jack Reacher film I decieded to follow up on some of his other books. The story line and the characters are well defined and there is not a rush to tie things together at the end.
4,FLOORED ME!,"Having read the newest of Lee Child's i.e. Bad Luck and Trouble, I decided to begin all over again and get reacquainted with Reacher from the first. Killing Floor is in the first person. You get to hear Jack's every thought and emotion. He is certainly not the most literate of men, but his intentions are honorable.After finding out the initial corpse was his brother, Joe (and it hits you between the eyes)Jack gets down to business to solve the Town of Margrave's enigma.It is a fun ride. The money laundering scheme is plausible but at the same time preposterous. Hey, it could happen. Lee Childs sometimes goes over the top and you just have to trust in a great ride of an adventure. One of the reasons I read Lee Childs is to find out how Reacher uses his brain and brawn to get out of tense situations. I dont care how he does it; I am on his side!!!!As Jack fades into the sunset at the end of the book, your heart goes with him and you want to search out the next installment."
1,Ridiculous from beginning to end,"Will admit up front that I really wanted to like this book. Jack Reacher is a no nonsense sorta guy who leaves a trail of bodies behind him. As others have pointed out, there are so many logical absurdities that you want to toss the book out the window. However, I slogged through figuring it had to get better. Sorry, but it gets worse. The Sunday ""deadline"" that permeates the novel is beyond absurd but is surpassed by the ending. Here is a little town that is suddenly crawling with local, state and federal agencies, to say nothing of the press, and Jack, figuring they might want to detain him for questioning (he has personally killed a lot of people including the town's mayor and the leading philanthropist so, yeah Jack, they might want a word with you), changes his clothes and hops a bus to California. Hey, no way the long arm of the law will be able to get me now!"
1,"Wow, what a bad book.",The nonsensical plot was driven by outlandish coincidence. Awful 1-dimensional characters. A truly terrible book. The ending was ridiculous. So many plot holes and contrived situations. Ugg.
3,Did anyone else notice the formatting error in the ebook?,"I so looked forward to reading the jack reacher novels by lee child. Starting with the first book in the series seemed like a good idea. When the novel was ported to ebook, did nobody actually look at how the book would appear on the kindle? Micro sized print detracts from the reading experience. Each chapter starts with the first line in micro print? Ebooks may be a new medium for selling books but if you can't read fine print, this novel will drive you crazy. Just sayin"
3,Entertaining,No deep thought needed for this book. A bit more detail about how to kill people than I needed. Over all an entertaining adventure.
4,Entertaining but Reacher's deductive skills require suspending reality,"Good book - fast read and entertaining. But lead character's, Reacher,ability to quickly put the pieces together and act are a little far fetched."
4,"Lock, load get laid","This is my first Jack Reacher novel, Lee Childs first also. This is great escapist fun if you like your protagonist, intelligent and violent, your story a bit unbelievable but fast paced and your writers capable of incomplete yet acceptable sentences. I couldn't put it down."
4,It is a winner,This is my first Lee Child book and I like it. well paced and good story line. I will be trying the rest of the series
4,Very good read,I had not read any of the Reacher books. This was the first of the series. I was very easy to read and kept my interest. Lots of action . I am now reading the second one in the series and it is just as good. Very good mystery stories.
3,Killing Floor,"good, solid fare for the plane ride to Hawaii...Can't imagine Tom Cruise in this role....good action and story line."
3,Predictable,"Although I somewhat enjoyed the book I kept finding myself annoyed with all the ""Shrugging"" and ""Right, ok?'s?"" I just got the visual of everyone shrugging at each other all the time. Very annoying, IMO.I hope Child stops that in his later books. If not, I'll stop reading them."
4,A fun read,"This was my first Reacher book. It was a fun read! I would have liked to know more about the character. I bought book two, maybe I will learn more about the character in this installment."
4,Killing Floor is killer good,"A unique if slightly bizarre main character.A succinct writing style.Freakish action.I want to read another adventure.Even after all the “roaches“ he killed, I liked the guy."
2,"Good action, but the characters don't make any sense","I could not connect to the characters in this book. The main character cares about nothing (which is fine, it's the author's character, but I cannot relate), but the real problem is with the love interest. A police officer who falls for a transient hobo (is there another kind?) who was arrested for a brutal murder? She lets him buy her lunch and asks him to stay at her house after a few sentences of conversation across a couple of days, falling straight into bed.Even though I didn't buy into the characters, I definitely like the author's style in writing action sequences. These were well written and very descriptive, forming very clear images in my mind as to what was happening.As a cheaper ebook, I'd probably try another to see if the author evolves/improves in sketching characters, but based on this first taste of this recurring character at this price, I'll probably look elsewhere for a popular fiction series to read."
4,Jack Reacher No 1,"My first Jack Reacher encounter!Absolutely loved the beginning of the book - one of the most intriguing and mysterious and amusing starts to a book in a long time. Then things got real complicated real fast.Lee Child handles the mystery and pace just perfectly - it is not a book you put down easily, because you want to read just one more page.Putting in some romance and some interesting characters like the old time barbers is a great touch.Be warned - it is definitely violent.But if you like your main man to be street wise and strong, to get things done, but to have a vulnerable side, then this is for you."
4,"A great read: great character, great plot.","Lee Child has set up a ""situation"" and leads the reader step by step into the truly fantastic but also quite beliveable plot. Just a bit slow at times. However the rest of the time our hero is going at 90 miles an hour all over the South. A very good read."
4,An American Tradition-Knight in Tarnished Armor,"This is the first in an established series that has a lot of first-timer mistakes. Many of the decisions/actions that the female characters choose seem very much out of a typical female reaction. Like, sure, I'm going to invite a homeless, recently released prisoner into my home/bed and leave him alone while I go to work. Duh! But the central figure--Jack Reacher--comes right out of that superb American tradition probably established by Dashiel Hamlett going through the Raymond Chandler-John D. MacDonald and now bringing us back around. Many of the newer ""adventure"" style novels either tend toward silliness (Clive Cussler), a dementia to detail (Tom Clancy Inc.) or have blood thirsty female leads. This novel leans more towards the old school notion of the Lone Wolf good guy making a difference on shady moral ground. Horrific violence, but still a welcome addition to an outstanding group of American anti-hereos."
3,Pretty good,Pretty good for the first of the series. I am already starting to read the second of the series and it seems to be real good.
3,Killing Floor,"If I could give this book 3 1/2 stars I would. I felt like the first 1/2 of the book moved too slow for me. However, I do like how Jack Reacher gets the bad guys in the end. Lots of action and killing throughout the book, of course -- If that is your cup of tea, you'll love the book."
1,Stupid,"Brainless, without thought, insipid, predictable, pretentious, dazed, deficient, dense, dim, doltish, dopey, dull, dumb, foolish, futile, gullible, half-baked, half-witted, idiotic, ill-advised, imbecilic, inane, indiscreet, insensate, irrelevant, laughable, loser*, ludicrous, meaningless, mindless, moronic, naive, nonsensical, obtuse, out to lunch, pointless, puerile, senseless, shortsighted, simple, simpleminded, slow, sluggish, stolid, stupefied, thick, thick-headed, trivial, unintelligent, unthinking, witless... and just plain stupid."
1,Lacks respect for reader,"Lee Child breaks a primary rule of writing by covering a subject that he knows nothing about. As a Briton, it is understandable that he knows nothing about firearms, rural America, or the American criminal justice system. What is unforgivable is that he did little or no research into those subjects before attempting to write a detective novel against the back-drop of a small town police station in rural America with lots of detailed ""gun play."" I have been a firearms enthusiast all my life, have lived in small town rural America (Pennsylvania, not Georgia) all my life, and have been the criminal prosecutor in my county for last five years. So, Child's cluelessness was duly noted.Detective novels are not on my usual reading menu. I thought it would be fun to go ""slumming"" for once. I figured this series must have something going for it, after all Hollywood made a movie based on the Jack Reacher stories. Mistake."
1,Killing price,"Because of the movie the book`s price on Kindle was raised to $10.00, despite having been witten in 2006. I could have purchased a paperback for less. I find this practice very sleazy on Kindle`s part. From now on I will check the price twice before buying an ebook from Kindle."
3,"OK, but not realistic","It's OK work, good really, but be ready to suspend disbelief. In the space of a few days, a man goes from being arrested for murder to leading an international investigation, partly into the dead of a family member. Does not compute!"
3,Unsure.,"A friend recommended the Jack Reacher series and after the first book (Killing Floor) I'm not sold. I don't read much fiction and much of the book is unbelievable. Mr. Child's writing style, to me, is very choppy, lots of short two and three word sentences. Some of the issues may stem from the fact that Mr. Child is British and his character is an American in the United Sates. Some of the words and phrases used just aren't part of the American lexicon."
3,Another Reacher,"This is not necessarily a review of this book so much as a review of the Jack Reacher series. Because, the sad truth is, if you've read three or four, you've read them all. When I first started reading them I became addicted to the pacing and tension. But like addictive drugs, the more you consume, the more you need and Lee Child doesn't deliver more, he just gives you more of the same. His writing is terse and taut, perfect for the genre, but unlike writers like Michael Connelly, neither the character nor the stories become more complex as time goes by. If you haven't read a Jack Reacher thriller, you're in for a treat. By the time you read enough of them to see the formula, it's time to move on."
2,Rubbish!,"The plot had some potential but was ruined by the laughably unrealistic nature of the main character, jack Reacher. His ability to get everything right all the time was comical. It will be a long time before I'll be able to face another Lee Child novel."
3,Should have been condensed by 30-40%,"Others have given the gist of the book. So I'll be brief:I liked latter books of Lee Child much better. Here he is still feeling his way, imo, and fills up pages with fluff and descriptions, so I found myself skipping whole chunks of test. If Child listens to Elmore Leonard's dictum to cut out the parts the reader skips, he'd cut this book by 30-40%. But the remaining 60-70% is not bad. The character of Reacher begins to emerge, though much of it is by exposition. (A more sophisticated writer would have let background emerge only when the info is needed.) But for a beginning writer (which Child was at the time), this is pretty good. Three stars."
5,Reacher - an improved Batman,"Very entertaining and exiting story. Jack Reacher is a more modern Batman; slightly more realistic, better with women and more cruel to his enemies. Childs formula can't go wrong!"
1,Not Worth the Time,"This story is so slow that I can barely endure 3 to 5 pages an evening. I am oh so weary of Jack Reacher mental meanderings and lack of action that I would not be disappointed with his death. If you are in to overly verbose descriptive phrases, extended suppositions that may or maybe determined or simply enjoy a ""slow boat to China"", jump in."
1,Unrealistic Childish Novel,Con:- Too many plotholes to count- Weak story. Anyone with half a brain could figure out the plotline after about 50 pages.- Terrible dialogue. You cringe when you read it.Pro:- Decent action
4,Jack Reacher's premiere as a Lee Child charater,I wanted to read a Reacher book after seeing the movie Jack Reacher which was based on One Shot. While the book was OK it lacked some real impact for me. I will read another Jack Reacher book before deciding on the series. I'm sure Reacher will mature as a character in subsequent books.
3,"Killing Floor Jack Reacher, No. 1","This is the first Jack Reacher book I read. I lovedfirst one, but I think he's improved since the first one."
4,A good read,I found this book a good read. It has a lot of violence and if you do not mind that you will probably like it also
3,Not a bad start,"The first Reacher book I read was the tie on with the Tom Cruise movie. I usually wait till I see the movie first but I was in an airport and getting bored.so I grabbed it. That book was a decent read, enjoyable.This is the first Reacher and as such it was 'all right'. I'm probably wrong but it felt some things had been left out when the company decided to Publish.""Look Lee we like the book but can you cut a couple hundred pages?"".As mentioned I have read others since, and am reading more, I and can confirm they are, over all, very entertaining Certainly great for a plane read.By the way I too was very much aware of the significant physical differences between Cruise and the character. Reacher is 6' 3"", Cruise isn't."
3,Passable Floor,"Too many things link up perfectly in this book. It just seems so far fetched to believe in half of the mumbo-jumbo of this book. Although it is an incredibly imanginative plot, Child goes wrong when he continues to add wood in the fire.Also, what police department in the world lets some drifter run a complete investigation???Three stars because I did like Reacher in a wishy washy way..It was a good plot (just went off track when he realizes it was his brother, don't want to say much more:) and I do like suspense novels and this has lots of suspense. Happy Read :)"
4,A Killer of a Book!,"If you like Sylvester Stallone or Steven Sagal's movies, this book is for you! Excitement and intrigue on every page! Jack Reacher is a lonely figure. OK, - this story's beginning is a stretch but the exciting reading is worth it. My kind of book! It delivers! You read the review of the book now get ready for an exciting ride. Several tense confrontations lead up to a power packed ending...and a little sad one too. On to Lee Child's next book. Worth the read."
4,What a great debut novel!,"I have to say, as debut novels go, Lee Child reached out and grabbed my full attention with this one. From beginning to end, there wasn't one part of this book that didn't keep me wondering what was going to happen next. Despite being a little graphic in a couple of places (which is to be expected in this type of book), I immensely appreciate an author who can write a book like this that holds your interest and attention and not once felt compelled to the 'f' word (or some of the other vulgarities that some authors feel the need to use). I have already started his second Jack Reacher novel, and so far it promises to be as good as this one."
2,Dimwit Hero in Kingdom of the Even More Dimwitted,"That the ""who's the traitor"" plot cleaves too closely to cliche to be a mystery is forgivable (well, not really), but the fact that none of the characters -- including two Ivy League professors who spend a year thinking about it -- can puzzle out the incredibly obvious plan the bad guys have in motion is embarrassing. The book moves decently, though, and the action is above average. I would definitely try another ""Jack Reacher"" book -- at least as soon as another ""Harry Bosch"" or ""Lucas Davenport"" book -- but I would bail out if I thought Child was being this lazy again in plotting. A better book than this is the original ""The Killing Floor"" (70s) by Jacob Asch, or for that matter Geoffrey Household's ""Courtesy of Death"" (60s) with which this book shares a number of similarities."
1,Far from a five star book!,"Look, this is just not a well written book. The hero is super human (and tells you as much every other page), the plot hinges on huge coincidences, and the author's style reads like a bad film noir script. If you want a quick read that won't make you think much, go for it."
3,Good but not great...,"Long novel to get through. A lot of action. But ultimately, I'm not sure I'll want to read more about Jack Reacher."
3,A bit of a dud,I read alot of mysteries and bought this number one of the Jack Reacher series with the expectation of finding a new series for me. My hopes started to dim when I realized that could not wait to finish it. The chacters were hollow. The plot far fetched and the detailed violence unnecessary. I will skip the rest of the series but give it three stars because others will like it.
2,I tried and tried,"I really gave this book a shot. It dragged on and on. Also, I don't think it helped that I am reading this after seeing Tom Cruise in the movie. The two characters are physically very different.Some of the material was a bit cliche, not much new. One Shot was better."
4,good,"good reading. keeped my attention thru the whole book. looking forward to reading more Jack Reacher books, and seeing the movie."
1,"Ripped off. Billed, but did not receive.",I just received only one chapter instead of the book. I was billed for the entire book This will stop me from ordering again.
3,New series,"Good read but I think it was a little too expensive for Kindle. One time read and no book to trade in for any credit towards another purchase. May go to a book store and purchase others in thi series as the books are $6. new, Good read though."
3,Wordy,"The Killing Floor by Lee Child is an interesting book with a good plot. I read this book because of the TV ads for the movie Jack Reacher. Wanted to see if this was a series that would hold my interest, so started with the first book of the series.While I enjoyed the plot, I did not care for the style of writing that takes a paragraph to set a particular scene or action which could be done with one succinct sentence. I use the Kindle app on my Android phone to read books. Using this, I can read a “page” with one glance. With the style of Child, I find that I must dig through several pages before I get to any meaningful sentence.If one wants a book with a great amount of descriptive scene wording, then this book is for you."
2,Starts off well enough then...,The book starts off with plenty of intrigue and keeps you guessing for the first half. Then the story begins to veer into ever less believable scenarios. Lost my interest along the way but finished it just to see if it had a decent ending. It did not.
2,So so..,"An easy read.. Some of the events were tensely constructed but overall found the plot unimaginative; also unbelievable, but not in an extraordinary way... All that being said I finished it."
5,"GOOD PLOT,MANY TWISTS","Friends told me about this series as their favorite author's character""Reacher"". Start these stores in sequence. I am on the third book, ""Trip Wire"",- my favorite so far.Though all books seem to follow similar plots, he throws enough changesin to make them all interesting. Child is the King of fast action writing."
4,I read it and shrugged,"I haven't finished the book, but I like the hero (I'm learning a lot about how to end a fight quickly and really hurt somebody) and the plot moves ahead, though in fits and starts. Way too much talk about what they had for breakfast.I am SO glad that others noticed the truly annoying repetition of the word ""shrugged."" This is simply careless editing. There are many ways a writer can express confusion or bewilderment. I thought the profusion of shrugs was obvious to me because I'm a linguist, but others noticed it too. It is bad enough to be a distraction, so now I'm counting the shrugs (20 in one 100-page excerpt) as I follow the plot. I blame his editor, David Highfill, for a truly amateurish oversight."
4,A Man's Story,"A character-driven story that comes close to blowing it with incredulity. However, a fun read. Jack ""Reacher"" Reacher is a man's man who can be surprisingly vulnerable around the woman he plays off."
4,Good story,"There is good character development in this book, can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series."
4,"Good, Simple Read","I got this book after I saw the Jack Reacher movie. The main character is a great creation and simple to understand. The progress of the book is easy to follow and you can see where the story will end up, but it's an enjoyable ride there. The best past though is reading through Jack Reacher's deductions of a situation. Very nice and detailed."
2,Good if you're looking for a fantasy novel.,"A good story is in the believability and believability is in the details. The details here are rife with inaccuracies to thePoint that an actual M.P. would be insulted. And, in what universe would the secret service allow one of their agents to be killed in a Podunk town and not send in their own people."
5,The Killing floor,"My first Lee Childs book, and I was not disappointed. From the beginning to the end, it is a well told story. Great character development and story line. I highly recommend The Killing Floor."
5,Killing Floor by Lee Child,My brother told me he really like Lee Child books. I totally enjoyed reading this book. And now plan on reading all his books.
1,Dumb,"If you like Rambo you'll love this. Jack Reacher is likeable fellow. However Mr. Rambo is just too much. I suppose the plot could be appealing in a simplistic way, but the characters are so without depth; the story so over the top. It's pretty much laughable."
2,How much can you suspend your disbelief?,"To enjoy this book you have to buy into a whole lot of coincidences. Huge coincidences. The first being that the main character just happens to get off the bus in a small town in the middle of Georgia, gets arrested for murder, then finds out the dead guy is someone he knows and hasn't seen in years. You have to buy that a police officer will fall instantly in love with a murder suspect/drifter. You have to buy that the police routinely go along with the execution of the bad guys without even bothering to take them in for questioning. You have to buy huge leaps of logic that are passed off as reasonable deduction. You have to buy that no one else in the federal government would be involved with this particular investigation. I could go on, but I don't want to give away too much of the plot for anyone that still might want to read the book. I'd give it one star but I'm cutting the author some slack since this is his first book."
1,Complete waste of time,"I read all of the five star reviews, then a trusted friend loaned me this book and recommended it. Still, I had modest expectations. I may strangle my friend. This book is one of the worst I have ever read, and I read a great deal of crime fiction. I hardly know where to begin. The plot holes have been aptly pointed out in other one star reviews. The writing style, and indeed personality of Reacher, is best described as ""sophomoric."" Perhaps Child is trying to tap into the literate pre-teens who are graduating from Harry Potter to werewolf/vampire fiction. No intelligent adult who reads anything other than the Sunday Comics would enjoy this novel. Its only saving grace is that the print is large and one can easily skim entire pages without missing anything, so even at 500+ pages, it is a mercifully quick read."
2,Ugh,"Maybe my expectations were too high; The Killing Floor did win the Edgar for best first novel, but I guess it must have been a weak year. Lee Child's first offering is typical of a first book, and that's the problem the story is typical. Nothing surprising or new here. It is both predictable and implausible. The book's hero, Jack Reacher, is boring. I think he is supposed to be mysterious and troubled, but I found him grating and arrogant. The book reads like a B action movie. The whole plot not only stretches the imagination, but also one's grasp of reality. It seems that Child has never left New York City and understands neither the American justice system nor small town life. Maybe I missed something, but I found The Killing Floor to be a sub-par thriller with flat characters and rather large plot holes."
1,Ridiculous. Stupid. Waste of time and money.,"One of the worst books I've ever been exposed to. The plot is stupid, the characters are cardboard cut-out stereotypes, and the main character does the most ridiculously unbelievable things. One example - he kills two men who are following him, seemingly the first people he has killed, or at least the first ones as a civilian, and just walks away from it to go hang-out with his police officer girlfriend who is not at all concerned that he killed them. It makes zero sense start to finish. It is simply not worth writing an in-depth review of - too much time wasted on it already.Thank you Audible for implementing a returns policy - this book was the perfect candidate for it."
3,I hope the series gets better,"The plot of this book pivots on coincidences that would make Dickens blush. It also has a lot of violence but, interestingly, no cursing that I can recall-certainly no f-words, which, in a book like this, you would expect in abundance. (By the way, we know that ""E Pluribus Unum"" means ""From Many, One"" but ""E Unum Pluribus"" means exactly the same thing, not ""From One, Many"". Changing the order of words in Latin does not change the meaning of a sentence since it's an inflected language; that is, a word's meaning in a sentence is derived from its suffix, not from its order in the sentence as is the case in English.)Having said that, I will admit having fun reading the book and I will start reading the second in the series today. For some reason, I kept thinking of Doc Savage, which I read as a kid, while reading ""The Killing Floor"". I only hope Mr. Child gets more realistic and does a little more research in future episodes."
4,Good read!!,This is a great mystery and the facts are kept until the end. I did not give this book a 5 star because at time the reading is a little too graphic for my taste. This is the first Lee Child novel I have read and will probably read more.
4,Different and Enjoyable,"This author has a different writing style which takes a few pages to get used to. He writes the story in first person, and mostly uses short sentences. Not even sentences. Just thoughts. I am enjoying the story, but it is taking a while to get to know the main character. I guess it reads like people think--in bursts rather than sentences. I will probably buy more Lee Child and look forward to fgetting more familiar with Jack Reacher in future books--not from the movie-!"
3,"It started slow, then picked up.","It was unique in several ways, the plot or mystery and the characters. It's a good read if you aren't getting tired of these kinds of ""super hero"" crime novels."
1,1 star for ingeniuity in getting it published.,"Having noticed more and more Jack Reacher books at my local airport, I thought I'd give one a go. It was awful. I thought publishers were supposed to read books before letting them loose on unsuspecting customers. I will not be reading any more Jack Reacher books. Life is just too short.The books failings are too many to spend time listing them all, but a quick rundown includes:1) Ridiculously unbelievable characters2) Badly researched plot3) A constant stream of ""no doubt about it""4) Inconsistent abilities of main character (crack shot who hits people at 100 feet with a pistol and then misses from 10 feet)Painful."
1,"I shrugged, he shrugged, she shrugged","Short sentences. Incomplete. He likes them. Loves them, really. Six word limit. Good for some folks. Not for me. No short attention span here. How about you? I shrugged. Why did I finish it? Dunno. I shrugged.If that type of writing appeals to you, then this is the book for you. It drove me crazy. The main character, Jack Reacher is really not very likeable. The plot is predictable and not very interesting. It just plods along in short, incomplete sentences with everybody shrugging. Blah!"
5,Killing Floor,As usual this book was a gripping tale and I couldn't wait for the next exciting page.Loved it.Looking forward to the next book in the series.
4,Great first Reacher,"He's in control but a bit violent, Reacher as anti hero is always a good page turner, with a twist somewhere along the way. Killing Floor is predictable, more so than some later books, but ejjoyable throughout."
4,It's the first Jack reacher book I've read ...,"... and it was a quick, enjoyable read. I like the image Reacher's character portrays. The story could have been a little more layered and complex; it takes place mostly in a small Georgia town and there's a fair amount of plot development that I consider 'jumping the shark'. I was hoping for more of a Robert Ludlum-esque level of plot development and complexity, but it boils down to this: I enjoyed the book and it made me want to read more of the Reacher books."
3,Fair,Not the best book I've ever read... but it was a good read. I like Child's writing style and that helped.
3,I must need to read more of them.,"I am sure it is a great series, but frankly for a first in the series, I found it a bit hard to swallow. I get the whole, ""torn, lonesome hero,"" it is the stuff of hero's going back to tales around the campfire. The basic premise of location and subsequent events are a bit challenging to one's suspension of disbelief abilities. Read it if you want to have an easy fast read, dare to hope that you come to know and love the character in subsequent books, but the Borne series was better, as was almost every other Bond and/or Sherlock Holmes. Frankly, I was so unimpressed, I will have to read another just to learn if I was right."
4,the killing floor,I liked this book a lot. It is very good. I like the character and I am looking forward to purchasing more books of this series.
4,Another Lee Child winner,"Another tense, gritty tale by a master of modern drama. A fun read, to be sure. Jack Reacher is again the nomadic hero. A one man wrecking crew against the forces of ill intent."
4,"Could not put the book, er, Kindle down","After seeing the Jack Reacher movie over Christmas, I ordered up the first book in Lee Child' series and finished it in one day. Couldn't put it down. I enjoy action/adventure movies and books and looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Rumor has it that Tom Cruises' production company has purchased the licensing rights for all of the Jack Reacher series. Birth of the American version of James Bond?"
3,A good first book for Jack Reacher,A good first book introducing the character Jack Reacher. I wasn't crazy about the ending. I do like the character though and I am looking forward to reading more in the series.
2,ohhum,"boring ,after seeing the advertisement of the movie i said i have to read the books,iread the first one and i could have saved my money , in one word boooooring. it,s nothing like the guy in the movie. no action. no suspense, just dry reading. save your money if your an action hunter i hope his newer books are better"
2,Disappointment,I was disappointed with this book. It didn't hold my interest and found that it was disturbingly violent at a time when there is too much violence in this country. I can't recommend it for anyone that doesn't have a perverted sense of life.
5,This book got me into Lee Child's books-the Jack Reacher series. AWESOME. LOVE IT.,"Nice straight story, quick read and I love the character. I am reading all of the books now. I am a gal and there are details of guns and stuff but I LOVE it. Totally recommend it. I found out that my husbands grandmother even reads these! So cool, never would have guessed."
5,Love a good mystery,"Jack Reacher is the man. I like a good manly, man who can take on anything and still get his butt whipped occasionally. A real thriller. I couldn't put it down."
4,Jumped on the bandwagon,"And I'm glad I did! I'm hooked! The 2nd book is better than the first, and th third is better than that!"
4,Killing Floor,"This was my first Lee Child book. It was intriguing, a little bloodier than I normally like but the story was good."
5,How a hero should be!,"A great read and hard to put down. A good plot line with plenty of twists. If you enjoy suspense and hero that does anything to win, you'll love this book."
4,Jack Reacher,Just got started in the Lee Child's Jack Reacher series and this is a great start. Enjoyed this read and will continue to No 2 and beyond ....
3,Good for light entertainment,"I must say this book was referred to me by a friend long before talk of a movie was to be out, and thankfully I took up the offer (the idea of Tom Cruise playing the same character is just crazy).If you're not looking for the intense crime drama focus and like a bit of entertainment in your investigative novel, this one is probably for you! It's no Christie or Forsythe, and nor is it meant to be, with the chapters moving rapidly and the ease of reading this, you'll usually be done with a Childs book in a matter of days - which has now led me to complete most of the series of Jack Reacher novels.Don't take the book too seriously and it won't be a disappointment for you."
4,Reacher does it again,"Another super hero story. Sorry I saw Tom Cruise play Reacher recently. Reacher, 6'5"" 250# Cruise 5'6"" is not Reacher.....Mr Child brings Reacher to life for me."
1,Inspirational,"""Killing Floor"" should be an inspiration to any aspiring writer. If this book could get published (and sell), anything can."
5,Reacher is cool,"I'm on my 5th Jack Reacher novel. Lee Child is excellent. I've been reading them all in a row. I haven't tired of the same author yet. Right up there with Dan Silva and Vince Flynn. Special Forces guys would like this too even though Reacher was an MP investigator, his knowledge is awesome. Not just braun but brain too."
4,Enjoyable,Obviously I am quite late getting to the party. I have stayed clear of this series as I generally do not like the action-hero type story. To my surprise there is quite a bit more here in terms of plot. Given the number of subsequent Recaher novels I assume there is a great deal more detail revealed as to his past. As a stand-alone Reacher's past is only touched on the surface but this is a fast moving story that does offer an intriguing plot. Of course it is at times cartoonish but it was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.
3,"Good story, except...","The story was pretty good. It was annoying to me that all the characters kept saying ""ok,ok"". Americans written by a Brit I guess. I hope that improved in future Reacher books."
3,My first Lee Child. I'll read more.,"Lee Child writes like Johnny Cash sings, like an unstoppable freight train barreling down the tracks. As my first Child/Reacher book, I was uncertain as to what to expect. It was a pleasant surprise. All the overused accolades apply, hard to put dowm, fast action, roller-coaster ride, etc.I also agree thought that you have to look beyond the technical gaffes regarding firearms and police work. Don't fixate on that and you're going to enjoy the book, a lot."
5,"Love the book, but...","I would love to read the rest of the series. However, at $8.99 each I will be hitting the library and used book stores. In some cases, the paperback is cheaper than the kindle version. I realize that ""the price is set by the publisher"" but thats just rediculous. No printing costs yet more expensive. Hmmm...."
5,Lucky me!,"The review of the new Jack Reacher novel says the publisher is using the slogan ""The best writer you're not reading-yet!"" Lucky, lucky me! I discovered Jack Reacher with this book and have read the following books with great relish! Lee Child is a great writer and Jack Reacher is a great character; someone a man would like to emulate and a woman (like me!) would love to meet. I can review 4-in-1. Read all of Child's work, starting with Killing Floor. You'll be very glad you did."
2,Disappointed,"After hearing many great things about Lee Child and the Jack Reacher series, I thought I would give it a try....start from the beginning of the series.When determining if a book is good, I must have the 'gasp factor'....did i gasp because I never saw that coming...did I actually have to physically put the book down and go 'wow - never saw that one coming'....I never gasped, never put the book down for the wow factor....I saw everything coming a mile away....Disappointed."
3,Killing Floor (Jack Reacher) book on tape,"We love the Jack Reacher books but this one was not, in our opinion, as good as the others. It is very long, so if you have a long road trip it will keep you interested along the way, but not riviting. We give it a 3 1/2 stars."
3,An interesting novel. . .,"This isn't a great work of literature which will stand the test of time, but it's a good vacation novel, i.e., traveling or at the beach.This is the first novel that I've read by this author. It's a typical mass market action pulp novel with a few twist and turns so that it isn't too predictable. It kept me entertained. I had read somewhere else about the conterfeiting technique used by the villans in this novel so that wasn't a surprise to me."
5,Can't wait to read the next one,I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action thriller books. I had not heard of Lee Child until I saw the movie Jack Reacher with Tom Cruise. A friend of mine suggested this series. I enjoyed reading this book. I kept turning the page interested in finding out what was next. Jack Reacher is an intriguing character.I am looking forward to the next book.
4,Killing Floor,"I recently saw the new movie with Tom Cruise, ""Jack Reacher"" and loved it. This is my first book by Lee Child and I really enjoyed his style of writing. He kept it moving, exciting, with just enough twist and turns. I look forward to the next book."
4,Action and Mystery,Fast moving well defined charecters and sub plots. At conclusion Jack moves on leaving the reader wanting more. Quick read.
2,I don't like it,"Mind you, I am a huge Reacher fan, I've read all of his books and shorts and there are some outstanding works. Of the first person writings The Enemy stands out, an absolutely brilliant piece of writing in my view. Killing Floor is also written in the first person but the style is so different from The Enemy that it gives me pause....What bugs me about Killing Floor is a) the thin thread of the story, and b) Reachers amazing bossyness -- and that everybody, even 20 year veterans of big city police work, bow in the dust in front of him and more or less ask guidance on how to tie their shoelaces (or some such).And there is nothing that stands out in the book. No sentences or paragraphs that I read again. Nothing that makes me go Aha. It puts me to sleep, is what it does."
3,A Little Farfetched,"Being this is the first Reacher novel I know the story lines get better. I had a little difficulty going with this line, but I always enjoy Jack Reacher no matter what!"
3,entertaining,tThe novel was entertaining. The plot was kind of slow. The characterization was superficial - I would have liked more in dpth. I'd give another in the series a try...
5,Love Lee Child,Love his Jack Reacher series. It pulls you in and keeps you in. You always want Reacher to win. Excellent
4,The Killing Floor,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - my first in this series, and am looking forward to the next by Lee Child.The story line was good and written well. A good plot with variety which held the reader with several twists and unexpected reveals.At times, the main character, Jack Reacher, seems a little too good to be true in his ability to get himselfout of situations. However, that is the way of heroes, isn't it?"
3,Sergio leone style modern thriller.,"A stranger enters a town, just like in the old Sergio Leone/Eastwood westerns and is drawn into a world of intrigue and murder. Though it's very much a modern mileau it is a page turner right up there on my list."
3,An entertaining novel though improbable,"To put aside the logic of how some events transpired in the book (a lot of things that a occurred were so unrealistic but...) , I was wrapped up in the story of what's happening in Margrave. It's a very entertaining novel and I couldn't put it down. With that said, I have to admit that there were some aspects that was a bit tedious/boring to read.I liked the novel even though it was a little predictable, some actions by Reacher was improbable and the end was somewhat disappointing."
3,Lots of skimming or patience required,"You have to have a lot of patience to get through this book. The storyis engrossing when you can get to it through all the layers and pagesdescriptive text. I read the kindle version and it took 60 pagesto say the Jack Reacher was pulled from a diner while eating breakfastand charged with a murder he didn't commit and though the investigatorsknew he was innocent he was sent to a lockup for the weekend. That's it!There are sections where you have to skim page after page to get throughthe next meaningful anything. I guess some readers will appreciate thestyle.The main character is interesting with a much more varied lifethan Harry Bosch. But Lucas Davenport in the ""Prey"" series hasis a much more enjoyable read, with lots of cop humor, great dialog,interesting and likeable characters and more terse writing with noskimming required!"
4,kept me guessing. couldn't stop reading.,"It kept me guessing about who might be involved in the conspiracy. I suspected almost everyone, except of course, Jack Reacher. Kept me reading late into the night. My first Jack Reacher novel, not my last."
2,A Bit Laborious!,"For a first novel I guess it's not horrible, but it did not meet my expectations based upon the reviews that I read before purchasing. For me, there was way too much extraneous detail. This story could have been told just as effectively in about half the number of pages."
3,Sometimes predictable,"The book was good if not great. Any time there was a twist about to occur, the writing was very specific, like there was a concious effort to make sure someone couldn't turn the pages back and say ""but wait, that can't be, he said ...."" so you knew to expect a turn.Otherwise, fairly entertaining. I may read the next one to see if the writing develops more naturally."
4,a good read,"It was a little drawn out in spots, but still a good read. Jack Reacher is a very good character."
4,Fluid movement.,"Well written although it did seem to move slow at times. I am looking forward to reading the complete series, in the order it was published."
5,Thank you Lee Child. I'm 75 yrs old. But when I read Killing Floor. I'm Jack Reacher.,"Thank you Lee Child. I'm 75 years old. But whenI read killing floor on my Kindle Reader that I Purchased from Amazon. I'm Jack Reacher, No. 1hamptonnoe@wowway.com"
4,:-),Good read!! I will continue reading the series! I'll go see the movie too.Reacher is an amazing character. Very resourceful.
3,What it says on the tin ...,"The first in the Jack Reacher series, it's a good, entertaining read that doesn't tax you too much, but is a great way of whiling away a few hours on a lazy weekend! Amusingly gory in some places, ridiculously implausible in others, but I'll read a few more Reacher books yet, I suspect."
3,Good not great,It was interesting. Jack has flaws and is very good and inflicting damage. I like series but I have sevral other I will read before I consider getting back to this.
4,Good introduction to the Jack Reacher series,I liked meeting Jack Reacher. He's a bad-ass and kicks much butt. I will read more soon in the future.
4,Good mystery,"A good story. Easy read with twists and turns. Some things you see coming, some you don't. It doesn't strain your brain too much but it certainly keeps your interest. I've just started this series and hope to add Mr Childs to my list of favorite authors. I'm a Clancy and Sanford fan, primarily just so you know where I'm coming from."
4,Killing Floor,Fast paced and smart plot liked Jack and the way you could read how his mind worked. I felt the ending was realistic in terms of Jack and Roscoe .
5,Number One,"I started reading Lee Child's book titled One Shot because the movie came out. Great book, great movie.I was like just about everyone else who reads Lee Child's books. You are hooked! It wasonly logical to start at the beginning of the series with Killing Floor (Jack Reacher #1).What a page turner!"
1,I've never been so bored,"This book was recommended to me by my housemate who RAVES about the entire series. I started this book with high hopes as she and I have about the same taste in books and movies. I can't tell you how hard I had to work to make myself read this book. I was beyond bored. He's over descriptive to the max. He'll take 3 paragraphs to describe a park bench that has no bearing on the story. Don't get me started on the unrealistic story line. It's a bit like ""24"". A too long, boring ""24"". This could have been a short story and should have."
3,"Easy reading, weak plot, weaker characters","Lee Child writes a great action book. In this, the first of the prolonged Reacher books, his ""superman"" character uses his own morality decisions to kill, kill, kill. Much of the violence was gratuitous, such as the crucifixion and gelding of the police chief, the oysters then forcefed to his wife. Right. The character development is weak (motivations obscure) and the plot of how the counterfit money makes its circuit unexplained, but, yeah, the action is great."
1,Horrible!,"I agree with everything the other one star reviewers said. However, I decided to write a review because I have friends who are big Lee Child fans so I bought the second book in the series, and it is just as unrealistic/bad/etc. as this book so save your money if you didn't like this book."
4,Great!,"I thought the book was great for a first time writer. An editor should have rechecked over the work. If one more person shrugged, I was going to scream. Other than that, Great job!"
2,A book you wont remember,"An ordinary thriller with a weak story,Free violence and superman ideology.I am sure that its great success,this kind of book sell well"
3,Pretty Good Story,"The story was pretty good. It gradually drew me in. I can't tell if it was the author's lack of knowledge about some of of the details or just poor proofreading, but there were some inconsistencies in the story. I'll probably try one or two more Lee Childs books to see. Did I mention I REALLY like this Kindle?!"
3,Doesn't make me want to read his other books.,"Initially I liked this book however it quickly becomes, how can I put this, Meh! I found myself with better things to do than continue reading and it became an effort just to finish. ""The dialogue sounds like something a 14 year old would write, right!"" I said."
3,Not brilliant but very readable,"Not the best book that I have read, but not the worst by a long shot. There are a number of holes in the plot and parts of the book are a little unbelievable. However, it is very readable and will hold your attention, provided you can overlook the inaccuracies, because there are some plot twists as well as bad ones. The cool clean hero kills all of the bad guys (some with quite brutal violence) and then walks away with a clear conscience as he was nice to the good guys. Pure escapism and overall I found it enjoyable enough.. Not in the same class as Michael Connelly or Jeffrey Deaver, though."
4,First Reacher Read,"My brother-in-law recommended Lee Child's Jack Reacher series to me and if the rest of the books are as good as the first, I am glad he did. Killing Floor is the first of the series. It features a unique plot, fast-paced action and a few surprises along the way. Not heavy reading at all, but very enjoyable.The writing style was interesting, too: a lot of short, choppy, to-the-point phrases and sentences - more along the lines of the way we think rather than the way we speak. The style seemed a perfect fit to the hero's personality and made the book flow quickly.Apparently the books in this series do not have to be read in the order they were written, but my brother-in-law has read them all and said he has seen some references to story lines in earlier books. I will most likely read them in order, too, so...bring 'em on, Amazon!"
5,Couldn't put it down,"While the premise of the story does hinge on some unlikely coincidences, this in no way detracts from the riveting action in this gripping book. I enjoyed it from page one until the very end. Not for those who cannot handle graphic violence."
4,E Unim Pluribus,"Joe Reacher is arrested the minute he hits this small town for murder, later to find out that the murdered man is a stunning supprise. He then begins the non stop action. The towns folk begin dying in gruesome ways at a record pace. Joe is a former, highly trained Military Police investigator, and is drawn into the web to find out who and why. It gets messy. This is my first Reacher read, and I am hooked. Very much like James Paterson who I can't get enough of. The twists and turns keep you hopping. It is a fast read you will not want to put it down."
2,"Some good parts, but not many","I really didn't care for this book. I hope the second one Die Trying is better. If Jack Reacher shrugged one more time, I think I was going to scream. There were some good parts though that I was able to fly through, but a lot of the book was unrealistic even for Rambo (which Jack Reacher is not!). It was like reading a really bad script for another Dwayne Johnson movie flop. I already bought the second one, so we'll see if Lee Child story telling gets better."
3,"A decent first novel, marred by technical inaccuracies","This novel almost, but not quite, makes the grade. Mr. Lee does a good job of plotting, dialog, and character development, but he needs to pay more careful attention to the details.He refers, for example, to a 22 caliber pistol as ""22 gage"" and attributes shot dispersion characteristics to a modern shotgun that would do credit to a 16th century blunderbuss. His concept of evidence is also faulty. He considers the legitimate possession of a large quantity of a legal item as evidence of a crime.If Mr. Lee intends to continue writing in this genre, as he should, he needs to familarize himself with firearms technology and nomenclature, rules of evidence, and other essential components of such books"
2,Lengthy tedious thriller,"Amazingly tedious for a thriller. Reacher is a good character, believable in his expertise, but a bit cold blooded in his use of violence. The book takes too long to tell everything (and I mean everything) - it seems every minute of the week long plot is chronicled as is every thought Reacher has (many repeated over and over). I hope Child fixed these flaws in later books."
1,Glad it wasn't my first Reacher read,"If this had been my first Lee Child novel with Jack Reacher as the subject, I wouldn't bother reading another. The airport scene--really? It makes it a much shorter read when you skip over some of the pages. Just cannot recommend this one."
3,Samurai Jack,"Killing Floor is the fourth Jack Reacher novel I have read, and the first in the series. Three of the four I've read have similar broad plot lines: a small rural town that is corrupted by, beholden to, and/or terrified by an evil family or employer, until Jack Reacher walks into town and kills all the bad guys. In other words, a Samurai movie. Child's books are good enough to make me want me to read a few more, but I am hoping for more diversity."
2,Almost Awful,"Although Jack Reacher is compelling, this book is far from it. The plot is trite and the villains are virtually nonexistent. A dark, shadowy, tough guy, walks in a dusty crooked town run by a rich SOB. Boring. Sounds like every bad Patrick Swayze movie. Of course Reacher falls for the only single girl in town, too, and way too quickly. Child indulges Reacher's fondness for cracking heads, but that was the lone bright spot for me. Otherwise, Killing Floor is a predictable, unoriginal, and disappointing read."
4,Compelling read,"It was action non stop with this book, I couldn't put it down. It is quite graphic though so not for the faint hearted."
4,The Killing Floor,"This novel was interesting, to say the least. The plot was well developed and very detailed, but some descriptions were a little on the gory side...definately NOT material for a person with a weak stomach. Also, the author's writing style was a little abrupt and hard to read at times. However, I thought that this book was good airplane reading material."
3,Did I read the same book?,Jack Reacher is great but the plot lets him down badly. The book seems well researched but the plot is painfully predictable. I read in avid anticipation of a plot twist that never happened. As for the handling of the relationship between the key characters at the end - simply awful!
1,shrug,"I got about three quarters through the book and just couldn't go any further. How did this get rave reviews? It is simply awful. There is so much shrugging going on that it's amazing anyone got anything done. I began to think that maybe the water was contaminated and was causing all this involuntary shrugging. And his characters shrugged at the most gawd awful inappropriate times. Shrugging is usually used to show complacence, but they would react to the most DIRE situations with a simple shrug. Not just the hero, but EVERY PERSON in the book SHRUGGED. And aside from all that, the story was thin, thin, thin. And frankly, boring."
2,Shrugged,"Lee Child loves the word ""shrugged"", and doesn't like commas. Jack Reacher has the potential to be an interesting alpha male, but the Child's writing needs to improve to expand the character to full potential. To be fair, this novel was copywrited in 1997, so perhaps his later work is better."
4,Great read,It takes a lot to keep me interested and Lee Child did it for me. Finished the book and on to number two.
2,Readable,"The book is good enough to keep my attention, not good enough for me to want to pick up the next in the series. Big problem I had is that it's quite evident that the Author has very little first hand knowledge of several things central to the plot of the book. In his favor, he did a fairly good job with some of it. He did not do a good job researching the US Military or firearms, nor did his editor. Shame, really wanted to like this book."
3,So-So,"Good Reading, was pretty predictable! I do enjoy the Jack Reacher character. Hope Book # 3is better!Thank you,Norm"
4,The Killing Floor is an exciting book.,"Very exciting,fast moving very little bad language I enjoyed reading something that didn't have sex as the main theme.Child is very knowledgable about military police and local auhtorities.enjoyed the book.The Killing Floor is good book to read."
5,Mach Man Jack Reacher,"Great read. Jack Reacher is the man most men wish to be. Still, I can not wait to finish reading future books."
5,Killing Floor,Great book. I have read Lee Child books in the past and this was another one I would recommend to others.
4,Good read,Likable character. Decided to read after seeing previews for the Reacher movie. Will continue to read the series until the plots are easily predictable.
4,fast paced.,Moves quickly. I was always wanting to see what's gonna' happen next . Reacher is a super-hero without seemingly intending to be. Good read. Looking forward to reading the next one.
2,Predictable,Was unbeleivable even for an action fiction book....It was obvious what was going to be on the next page......It was entertaining but far out there.....
4,Terrificly entertaining!,"Had I found fewer errors in this book, I'd have given it 5 stars. I'm a stickler for that stuff.Still, this Jack Reacher character is my kind of hero. I've seen others refer to him as an anti-hero. Forget that! He's perfect, in a flawed, unique way. I'll be reading the rest of the series as soon as I can get my hands on them.Pricing is too high for some of them, at least as ebooks go, but I'm guessing the used paperbacks are cheap here and elsewhere. Man alive! When will publishers figure out that $12.99 or $14.99 for an ebook is highway robbery? It irritates me particularly because I want to read all of Lee Child's books now. I highly recommend this one."
3,Beginning of Jack,"This is the first in the series of Jack Reacher novels, and although it's a great novel, it does not compare to Lee Child's more matured writing with Jack Reacher as the hero (refer to my gone tomorrow review)"
2,just OK; not enough for me to read #2,"I liked the suspense of this book through the first couple hundred pages but started to feel like it was just too stretched out to sustain the momentum. More importantly, I could forgive one or two of the coincidences and unlikely situations, but the last hundred pages strained credibility too much for me -- and, far worse, used too many bad thriller cliches.Spoiler-ish alert: When Reacher is given a certain amount of time to find Hubble, that's straight out of all the worst movies where the bad guy says ""You have ONE HOUR!!"" thus allowing the good guy time to hatch a plan and rescue everyone. These are vicious men who enjoy torturing people for fun; why wouldn't they do the same to Reacher (or Roscoe and Charlie), get an answer out of him and go get Hubble themselves? And really, no harm came to the women at all? That's just too nice and convenient.In the end I was disappointed; I was all set to buy book #2, but -- nah."
4,Good read,Well written with good characterization. Fair to good plot and makes me want to read #2. I look forward to the good guy winning in a reasonable scenerio.
4,Great story,This book was well written and was a great introduction to the series of Jack Reacher which I started after seeing the movie.
3,Killing Floor,Killing FloorA good start to the series. Nice to see where the person came from and why he is how he is.
5,This does work on cat's bad breath.,"This product does make my cat's breath less smelly, and Amazon has it almost two dollars cheaper than the place I had first ordered it."
4,Making Progress,"I bought this for my 2 cats. One had bad breath and the other did not. I have been using it for a few weeks now, and I notice that the bad breath has diminished. It's not completely gone, but I will continue to use the product in hopes that there is continued improvement. Also, it seems like both cats can taste the product in the water, but in a good way! They seem to love it!The only downside is that with 2 cats and multiple water bowls, the bottle is not going to last long. I'll see if there's a bigger size next time."
2,Cat didn't like it,"The liquid smelled good enough, but my cat did not want to drink it, no matter how dilute it was. I'm sure it would have worked fine, as someone commented on the first day that his breath smelled a little minty, but once my cat got a taste, he was done. His water dish stayed full for days, and he started drinking dishwater."
3,My Cat Didn't Like This,"I thought this did what it said it would; my cat's stinky breath was less stinky after he lapped up some of this in his water bowl. However, my cat didn't seem to like the taste or smell of this, and soon avoided his water bowl. I stopped putting it in his bowl because cats drink little water as it is, so I didn't want him to stop altogether. I can't say I blame him; I didn't taste it (obviously) but the smell was a bit musty to my thinking. Maybe I just got a bad bottle."
3,Enjoyable,"This was an enjoyable short novel about love and understanding. Esquivel's main character, Júbilo, was a telegraph operater with the ability to read/see and interpret another person's thoughts and feelings. Júbilo used his gift to get people together and make his way through life. Unfortunately, his gift did not always work in his favor, all of which comes out in his love for his wife and family. ""Swift as Desire"" has a few slow parts that drag parts of the novel down, but overall it's worth reading."
3,not nearly as good as her other books,"I enjoyed the opening chapters with the Mayan calendar theme and the period details, but then things fall apart as Esquivel either recycles older material or whips off the remainder of the book in 10 minutes time. It's a quick read so it's not like you'll spend more than an hour reading it and the plot was interesting and touching, but it just doesn't hold together. In short, it's not very magical or interesting past the opening chapters. Her father sounds like an amazing man -- there are some great scenes, but a bunch of great scenes don't make a great novel unless they are more seamlessly intergrated. I couldn't get over the feeling that this was an old composition dressed up quickly for publication. Fans should read it anyway for the plot, but don't expect anything on a par with Like Water for Chocolate. This translation felt stilted in places."
5,Documents Alanna Knight as an extraordinary novelist,"The Gowrie Conspiracy is an enthralling, historical murder mystery by Alanna Knight. Set in the court of King James the Sixth during the early 1600s, The Gowrie Conspiracy presents a tangled intrigue of bloodlines, power struggles, petty court clashes, and a terrible hidden secret in King James' past that could jeopardize the entire royal court. A suspenseful tale that keeps the reader guessing within its unbroken ambience, The Gowrie Conspiracy clearly documents Alanna Knight as an extraordinary novelist with an impressive gift for writing historical mystery fiction."
2,i wouldn't have reviewed this,"if the other review hadn't been so glowing.i ordered this book after reading the first page--i thought any writer who could make me laugh within the first three paragraphs would be worth reading. i was wrong.some readers may enjoy her style--that's a matter of taste. i found it annoying--choppy, repetitive (although a good editor could have helped there), and very slow to develop. the dialogue is stiff (and i don't mean the dialect--i'm scottish, i've been to scotland, i understand the dialect), the descriptions graceless, and the character development minimal.if you can get past her style, her explanation of the events is interesting. but it took a lot of effort for me to get past the first quarter of the book."
2,Where's the beef?,"Meteoritics and impact phenomena are a fascination of mine and, with some anticipation, I purchased this book. I was disappointed. The treatment of impacts and their consequences was cursory for the most part and frequently conclusionary rather then illuminating. While the book contained a few facts not found in other, similar volumes, I felt book was written from hunger rather than love, if you will. The science and logic were frequently off the mark, in my view. Not the sort of book one would read for an in depth understanding of the topic."
3,"Yes, you can get pregnant the first time.","Back Cover description: The boss's baby. Ruth had been overwhelmed by Franco Leoni from the moment she became his secretary. A shy reverend's daughter, Ruth was stunned when such a dynamic, handsome man took an interest in her. She knew she shouldn't, but she couldn't help falling in love with her boss! Franco didn't want a secret affair, but Ruth was afraid of scandal. She tried to disguise her feelings and conceal their passion. Only, there was one thing she couldn't hide: she was expecting his baby!This is my second Ms. Williams story. I liked MERGER BY MATRIMONY better, but this wasn't bad. Yes, as the other reviewer states it does seem to waver, but it's not bad. I think I was expecting a stronger heroine, but I like the way this author makes the hero vulnerable. And Ruth's parents can't be that unaware/innocent of what is going on."
2,not that great,"After reading one of Cathy William's previous novels, Accidental Mistress, as a new reader I highly anticipated her next book. I have to say I was really disappointed in the novel. AFter the first charged chapter, the book fell apart. I wouldn't waste my money unless I really needed something to read."
3,its ok,"this book is pretty good if you are looking for the science and documentation of ghosts, it has real hauntings from every part of america, like new england, new york, from pennsylvania to the midwest, the southern states, adn ghosts in california. I would reccomend this to anyone intersted in real ghosts."
5,excellent,This was a Christmas gift for my mother. It arrived well in advance of Christmas in the condition indicated.
2,Is there a point?,"I consider myself an avid reader and love the vampire genre. I'm also a fan of historical romance and romance in general. This book was so confusing. I could never tell who was having what dream or what thoughts. I kept with it though, thinking it had to get better and that some questions should get answered soon. Well, you practically have to wait until the last chapter - the epilouge. And then things are wrapped up so fast. It's almost like the author didn't know how the book was going to be from one chapter to the next. I've read other Shannon Drake novels and this is the first I've been disappointed in. Save your money and choose another book."
2,Not up to par for Drake,I found the book tiresome. It was definately not up to the usual standard for Drake.
2,Realm of Shadows by Shannon Drake,"The story plot started out very good.The first couple of chapters had mystery and excitement. I was looking foreward to seeing how these two indviduals were going to get together and solve the mystery. But it started slowing down and the connection just wasn't there. The Characters started out good,but she left them all hanging with no real meaning.The only real mystery in this book was how all the characters were related to each other.The love story in the book, if you can call it a love story, was short...you would miss it.( I am not sure if this book was meant as a vampire love story or just a vampire story) The story all together was chopppy. The heroine in this book, if you want to call her that, was not a very good one. The ending of the book had a lot to be desired. This book had potential but got lost somewhere."
4,Very Good Read,"Realm of Shadows was a very good book. The twists and turns were original and left the reader wanting to continue until you found out what was going to happen. The character of Brent was very masculine and sexy with a world of intelligence that was always evident. Just from the description of him you could tell that this was no ordinary man and he was even more mysterious than the fine Lucian. Tara was a nice heroine, but I did think that she fought too hard in trying not to believe in the reality of vampires. Her struggle became monotonous and did drag on, but I thought that she was a brave character anyway. The mystery of the dig and the evil villians made the book and took it to a whole new place. I really liked that it took place in France. That just made the book even better."
2,Quite painful really,"When the writing skills of Danielle Steel meet a pale imitation of Anne Rice universe. I am particularly upset, because despite the poor and boring style, I kind of hoped the storyline would unfold at some point. But it remains hopeless up to the final full stop. If you are older than 10, please avoid."
3,Quick Read,"Tara Adair(not Mason as on the back cover) is going to Paris to take care of her aging grandfather. Her cousin Ann is worried about him. He talks of something called the Alliance and is worried about an archeological dig at a deconsecrated church in his village. Tara checks out the dig, and while she is being chased by one of the workers, the other worker is killed, decapitated and drained of blood. The crypt they are excavating is empty. Tara finds herself in a confusing world where none of her previous beliefs are valid and noone is as they seem.This was an enjoyable and quick read. The characters were fun and the villians were very entertainingly evil."
1,A Heather Graham by any other name can't write any better.,"Shaonnon Drake is the nom de plume of Heather Graham. Both are basically in the ""bodice ripper"" genre I guess. (Graham is the name for hardcovers and Drake for the paperbacks, it would appear).This book was so bad I almost stopped at the ""Prologe"" in which the errors were almost laughable. The author's vision of WW-II combat seems to have come from watching the final battle in the movie Zulu one too many times.From there I was able to wade as far a a slice of Chapter 2 where a combination of boredom and lack of interest in the plot overwhelmed me. I'm glad I just checked this out from the library, because I hate to think I would have spent money for it."
2,A LITTLE UPSET...,"I WAS SOOO DISAPOINTED IN THIS BOOK.. I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF FINISH READING IT, AND I'M ONE OF HER BIGGEST FANS..."
4,Not a bad edition to the genre...,"I waited impatiently for this book to come out, for months (like most of us probably do <smile>), and while I found it to be a good book, I didn't think that it explored the characters, or their relationships, sufficiently to really be as gripping as some of the others in the series.It was great seeing some of the characters from the previous books, such as Lucian and Jade, and Rick Boudreaux, but there were a lot of new characters added, and I think they needed to be fleshed out a little more, for those who had, perhaps, not read the previous three books in the set.All in all, it was a quick read, and I enjoyed it, however, I had hoped it would be as fast-paced and engaging as the previous books.But would I recommend it? *Definitely,* no question about it, and I'm still looking forward to the next book in her vampire series, which is due out around this time next year."
2,It was OK,"This was the first Shannon Drake novel I have read. I did not find it all that great. There was not enough suspense in it for me and, it started to get boring after the first hundred pages. I could not really get into the story."
2,A Page skipper,I really tried to get into this--but no romantic and too much dialog--too much description....I became impatience for the story....A true shame!
4,Different,"I've had some trouble finding out the order of the books in this series, I started with this one and found it different~ I usually read historical by SD but thought I'd try this since I had heard such bad reviews~ I enjoyed the characters and the different view she used~ Not all blood and gore~ I have also read by Anne Rice and found that from each perspective you see a different view of this subject~ I wonder if the previous books and later books of this series are so bad why do others keep reading this series????? I read the Savage series by Janelle Taylor and after the 4th book I stopped since the books were not about the same characters that her first book was on but their descendents~ So if you find that the story is heading in a direction you dislike pick up a different book~~~~~~"
1,BAD!,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINT. THE BOOK WAS BORING AND TIRED.THERE WAS NO ROMANCE OR HEAT BETWEEN THE MAIN CHARACTERS. I FEEL THAT SHANNON DRAKE IS TRY TO HARD.BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME
1,Where has Shannon Drake gone?,"I have read all of Shannon Drake's books, but I could not even get to chapter 2 on this one. This is not what my romance dreams are made of. What a let down to look for this author and find this type of book."
2,Disappointing,This was my first Shannon Drake book and I found it disappointing. The romance between Tara and Brent is almost non existent. The love scene was over before it started.
5,"Fish Fossil at Hays, KS","Great book! My daughter received this book as part of her 2nd grade curriculum through K12. The book details a specific fish-within-a-fish fossil. The original of this fossil is located at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History at Fort Hays State University located in Hays, Kansas. The museum has also has robotic dinosaurs and is located on I-70 halfway between Kansas City and Denver."
5,survival story,"I could not stop reading this book. It is a must read if you like sea stories. Every time our characters seem saved, they have another set back"
1,Boring,"Boring. Too much drum, every track...Boom,Boom ,Boom..All start the same.Boring,Boring, Boring.I enjoyed Shine and was looking for more. This remix shouldn't have been. Wish I hadn't bought it."
5,The Girls At Their Best!,"This CD 'Remixed' is another example of Bond'sgreat talent. This one, like the last one 'Born'is what makes music worth listening to. Wellworth the money. Bond shows how good theyreally are. Especially Jingle Bell Rock!Maybe they can make a Christmas CD."
5,Extremely well done Remix compilation,"The album is excellently well done, well produced. The remixes make sense, except for ""Victory"". There should be a lot more Bond in that songs. The ""new"" songs are terrific. They pick up where Shine left off, with a new sound. This CD is getting me excited for their next full-length CD release. My favorites on the CD are all the new songs, ""Shine"", ""Wintersun"", ""Ride"", ""Bond on Bond"". This is an excellent CD that needs to be listened to. I recommend this along with their two previous releases."
3,Some Good - Some Not So . . . . good,"The earlier efforts were better. New mix of Fuego is great. Everything else is, to one degree or another, good (not great) music lightly sprinkled around a bass drum solo.Recapturing the magic in ""Fuego"" is going to be tough. And there's nothing here with the laid-back easy listening qualities of, say, ""Stranger In Paradise"" on SHINE.I'm still looking forward to the next one, but I hope the drummer moves on to other things."
4,Wonderful for fans,"bond is a wonderful music group that certainly has sparked new interests in classical music and string instruments. For the most part, their music is fantastic; however, one of the remixes on this CD just should not exist. The Sharp Boys Remix of ""Victory"" is terrible. They barely play the actual tune of ""Victory"" and lasts way too long with what they actually do play. Also, the CD seems to be too short (only 45 minutes) even though it has 2 music videos (""Victory"" and""Fuego""). Nevertheless, it is a wonderful CD, with a few new songs and, other than ""Victory,"" are wonderful remixes."
2,dolinas?,"I haven't read the book but I read the few pages on Amazon. I learned something new. The Italians of 1914 spoke Spanish! this is why they called the doline (plural of dolina) ""dolinas"" according to this sloppy author."
1,Very disappointing,"Each chapter is more promise, but no delivery. The book reads like a first draft that was phoned in to the publisher. Is full of mistakes about the history of tango."
2,"less than two months into owning, need new bow","less than two months into owning this instument, a little wooden piece flew out of the bow and now it cannot be tightened, rending the horse hairs too loose. need a new bow. Amazon? I am writing this review bc I did not see a way to ""contact seller"" which in this case is Amazon! Thanks"
1,Not a good introduction to yoga,"The first section of this DVD shows diverse teens saying how much they love yoga. The next section starts right away with active poses. There is no explanation, warm up, centering, or discussion about breathing. The poses move quickly from one to the next (downward facing dog, triangle, and sun salutations in the first 5 minutes.) There is no discussion of how to get into the poses or how a beginner gets started. The models look to be in the 18-20 year range and appear to be serious athletes. This is all intimidating to a beginner. (For a more experienced yoga practitioner, there are many more interesting videos as well.)"
1,Not worth the price of the tape it's on,"The quality of this dvd is atrocious. The sound is awful (and doesn't even match the video in most spots). Several scenes are repeated.many of the kicks and breaks were admittedly awesome, but the lousy quality overrides any good points to the dvd.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,The Best of the Best Tae Kwon Do,"This DVD has some outrageous jumping kicks, tremedous boardbreaking, unbelievable self defence, and some crazy kicks. If you are involed in Tae Kwon Do you will appresiate this DVD."
1,lame,"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow: Not a bad movie for its era, with lots of fun 50s music. Its amusing to see 50s teens being hepcats, and not often do we see girls dragracing. The stupid parrot is a huge deterrent of this movie, extremely annoying and not funny. Overall this campy film is still to banal for me to recommend. Ghost in the Invisible Bikini: GODAWFUL. Shame on Karloff for doing it. This one has more of a 60s feel, which I can't stand. I veer away from 60s films because I find the film industry really undermined the intelligence of the general public at that time, portraying them as knieve and ignorant. I understand campy films are meant to be fluff but this movie is seriously meant for 5 year-olds, not adults....and even 5 yr -olds may find it stupid."
5,Everything by Freeman is excellent.,"Yoga Breathing.The Yoga MatrixEverything by Freeman is excellent. You can get it without hesitation. That goes also for his Yoga Matrix.He is serious, honest, clear, well balanced, pleasant to listen to. His undouted knowledge and feeling for what he teaches, makes it effortless. Moreover he speaks with a warm voice, clearly & simply, well timed, with nice pauses, making difficult topics accessible even to beginners. He does not linger on a subject too long, so it is easy to concentrate. As a teacher I appreciate his teaching. If you want to go deeper on subjects you will have more reading to do."
1,Not a good Yoga Breathing CD.,The instructions are extremely poor and hard to understand.I label this a waste of money.
3,Historically interesting,"This book succeeds at depicting furniture designs that in their time held a place in the Arts and Crafts movement along with the great designs of the Stickleys and a few other masters. Are these pieces as pleasing in form and sturdy in structure as those designed by Gustav and his brothers? Do they all adhere closely to the design principles of the Arts and Crafts movement? Is Harvey Ellis' influence apparent in any of these designs? Not to my eye. However, much of what's in the book appears simple to build, and some would be useful to have around the house. By way of contrast, I find the designs presented in Robert Lang's books and in the Bavaro and Mossman book to be more to my liking. Those books also include more information about construction processes and details."
3,Mission Furniture:How to Make It,"This is a fine book for a somewhat more advanced woodworker. The title is a little misleading; the styles are more Stickley like. I see little or no Greene and Greene influence here. With 213 pieces of furniture illustrated in one book it is a little short on details and the sizes of the drawings will test the quality of your reading glasses. Although you might want to make you own shop drawings for some of these pieces, they're not Louis VIII style and complexity. You might get along just fine with these illustrations. There are several newer books about Craftsman Furniture with better drawings though less items illustrated."
1,Don't bother,"Waste of time, waste of money. Any valuable information from Deepak Chopra is in his original book ""Perfect Health"" and it is slim pickings at that. Every other book he has written since ""Perfect Health"" is a watered down re-hash of the same material. Don't bother with this book, or any of his others. You'd be better off with an all around nutrition book."
5,Transformational,"The message within the pages of Grow Younger, Live Longer is nothing short of transformational! Practical, easy to follow, result oriented ways to live a long, healthy life. Chapters cover a wide variety of topics including, sleep/daily routine, diet, exercise, creativity, flexibility, and mind/body/spirit balance to name a few. There is also a selection of delicious, nutritious recipes that leave the reader wanting more.A personal story: I had the pleasure of meeting (and having my picture taken with) Dr. Deepak Chopra at a presentation he delivered as part of the promotional tour for this book. After hearing the lecture and reading the book, I finally found the courage and inspiration to finish my own book. Give Dr. Chopra a chance to show you how to Grow Younger, Live Longer.... you won't be disappointed![...]"
2,Impractical,"Small font, to much text... Tehnicaly speaking, this book is in general impractical for reading... U can't put it in front of you and read, it is imposible. You must hold it if you want to read."
4,Good Summary and straight forward,I enjoyed this book as a review of some quantum mechanics basics. The applied examples are pretty good. This would be an excellent book to use as a source of problems if one were teaching an undergraduate class.
1,NOT the soundtrack! BEWARE,"This is NOT the soundtrack to Ong Bak. If you look closely at bottom of the cover image it says something in French that I imagine means ""Songs Inspired by the music of Ong Bak."" This is a bunch of Rap with backing music similar to the music in Ong Bak. Very very disappointing for someone who hates Rap and wanted the soundtrack to Ong Bak!"
3,ehhh.....,"They're not bad looking but mine all tend to float crooked, and the flame is very large unless you pull the wick almost completely down."
2,Floating oil candles,The oil candles arrived very well packaged. the wick was taped to the candle which meant a lot of work to wash off the adhesive from the 66 that I ordered. They are beautiful but very labor intensive to set up especially with so many. The wick gave off black smeach even with just barely showing. It was also difficult to find the right amount of oil to keep the candle floating evenly upright. We had to cut the wicks so it barely touched the base of the lamp otherwise is tipped over. Not sure I would use them again for a business event.
2,Very thin,"These are very thin walled glass. I filled one of the floating oil candles with oil. Sank right to the bottom of the water bowel. You can only put a small amount of oil in the vessel on it sinks. They float crooked too. I will likely bury them in sand or marbles instead of thing to ""float"" them."
3,"Not happy with Order.. Beautiful looking, but float crooked","I ordered these for my wedding. Luckily, I just ordered a starter set to make sure it would work properly. After setting them up, I cannot get the candle to float evenly. It leans to the side and looks crooked. Although the light they put off is beautiful, they look crappy because of it leaning. Very disappointed.Don't waste your money.UPDATED: Shortly after making this comment, I found a way to fix the crooked glass syndrome. I had some leftover black sand from a fish tank, put a little bit in the bottom, and voila! No more Leaning! I changed my original review to 3 stars to account for the simple fix and it definitely is beautiful."
3,Dalai Lama,"I had absolutely no idea what Buddhists stand for so I bought and read this simple but very informative book. I actually enjoyed the Dalai Lama's writing a lot but didn't necessarilyagree on so many of their beliefs.I'm pretty sure you'll feel the same way too when you come to a page where his holiness writes that ""we"" can meditate even while we're driving! I am still shocked as you can imagine and can't seem to find a reasonwhy his holiness would recommend something like that."
4,Teachings of the Dalai Lama,"This latest book by the Dalai Lama is a compilation of speeches he gave in NYC in the past. It lists the main traits one should practice to fulfill a healthy lifestyle: compassion, empathy, wisdom, and so on. If you have already read 'Ethics For The New Millenium' or 'The Art of Happiness' you will find that this book repeats much of the material in those books. The main difference I see in this edition is that some basic meditation techniques are covered. Overall, it is a book that reminds us of the most important qualities one should practice to create a centered life. I also recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Eastern Wisdom"" by Taro Gold which is filled with hundreds of thought-provoking and inspirational quotations."
5,Insightful!,"This is an easy to read book with tons of insight into a better mindset. You should read the book slowly -- take time to reflect on each idea, such as compassion. Keep the topics of the book in mind throughout your day, whether you're a mom at home, a student at school, or working in your cubicle. It will be the first step into inner peace and practicing compassion in every day life."
1,Huge Disappointment,"The cover of this book is totally misleading. It gives the impression that the book revolves around an interracial couple.What a crock.The dialogue in the book is so herky jerky in its floetry that I was left wondering what and who the characters were and how they came together.The main characters are not interracial.Okay, let me be honest I am not sure who the main characters are suppose to be and to be honest, at this point I really don't care.This book is a frustrating read.This is one of the worst editing jobs I have ever been exposed to in my life. I have not even gotten halfway thru the book and it is going back to the store.If you in anyway value your sanity DO NOT buy this book.I wish someone had reviewed this book before I wasted my money.I gave it one star because it seems no stars was not an option."
1,Did not live up to the Harlequin hype!,"I was very excited to see that Harlequin was crossing the barrier and getting hip by publishing a book that featured an interracial couple, Kris and Tom. Unfortunately, this book was a disappointment. Two stories were being told simultaneously but the book focused more on Jill Ferrell and Scott Randall's interaction (both white), which was a lot more interesting than the interracial couple's relationship.Jill and Scott's romance had more depth; whereas, Kris and Tom's relationship seemed too shallow and the author completely skipped over the beginning of the relationship of ""how they got together""... we are told right away that Kris is in love with Tom....how boring!"
1,Look elsewhere for a great IR story.,"I've been a big fan of some of Eva Rutland's earlier works. This story seeks to address a current trend of writing about interracial (IR) relationships.This story focuses on two couples - Kris & Tom and Jill & Scott. The story of the couple not depicted on the cover (Jill & Scott) is more interesting than that of the interracial ""lead"" of the story. This books lacks some of the basics to a good read...it fails to build or sustain an interest in the characters who are the supposed main storyline and the main couple of the book lack an intrinsic chemistry.For a good book featuring an interracial story, try others such as ""At Last"" by Lisa Riley. You will get a more satisfying read for your dollar."
1,Horrible! A wide and vast disappointment.,I was really looking forward to this book. The wonderful cover and blurb completely misled me. This author completely failed to develop the characters and relationships in this book. I didn't care about these people or their stories. Nothing happens that would be of interest to anyone. No excitement in the story. No depth in the writing. I wish I had spent NO cash for this utterly horrible read.
1,Horrible! Horrible! and more Horrible!,"Absolutely, the worst. I am an avid reader of interracial romance and this book was the absolute worse. The author should take pointers from the writing of other interracial authors to see how it is done. Please someone ask the publisher to scrap this book and ban it from future sale. Yeeech!"
1,Not a love story,This was the first book I read by this author and my last. I was so bored by the third page. There is no fire or heat in this book.
3,An 'A' for Effort but not much else,"I love Eva Rutland but this novel was a total disappointment. I had such high hopes for this book, having heard about it last year and it was eagerly anticipated.Honestly, I felt shortchanged - Kris and Tom (the couple shown on the cover of the book) seemed to be nothing more than window dressing. There was no depth or breadth to their characters. The book spent more time on the developing relationship between Jill and Scott - Kris' best friend.I didn't really care that the sensuality level wasn't high - because anyone who had read Ms. Rutland's books in the past know that isn't her forte. However, there wasn't even the slightest hint of erotic tension between Kris and Tom.The only reason I give this book a '3' is for Harlequin finally understanding that interracial marriages are a fact of life and all women want to read a GOOD story about such love. I also give this book a '3' because I like Eva Rutland."
4,This is cool stuff.,"I became interested in this band after reading a review praising Neon Golden and listening to a couple songs from that album. I liked them, but that album, and most of the others, were expensive imports or just unavailable at the time, so I ended up with this one, which is quite different from what I'd heard. Folks seem to think Neon Golden is like Kid A; I dunno about that but I can say this one doesn't suggest any Radiohead comparisons. It's all harsh guitars and pounding drums and only the occasional dispassionate lyric--metal, I guess, but I'm not much on the genre names so forgive me if I simply call it good."
1,The Notwist = Nogood,"Taking a chance at a local record store, I bought this album.Taking the cd and throwing it in the trash, I hated this album.I was a big fan of Neon Golden, and I had no clue about this first album. It is completely different and lacks any diversity in the music. Make sure you listen to it before you make the purchase."
4,Wish they could re-release the double CD version!!,"For those US people, this CD was actually originally a double vinyl album in Europe, and sadly this cropped and edited collection, though excellent, misses some really cool stuff like ""Sons of Pioneers"". If you have to buy one Japan CD, this is it: but really, get all the studio albums!! Oh, and buy all the David Sylvian stuff, especially Brilliant Trees and Gone to Earth (also sadly a double album that became a single, cropped CD)."
4,Great music - shame some tracks were lost...,"When this was originally released in the UK I bought the vinyl and cassette versions. I recently updated to the CD and was taken aback to discover that not all the tracks are on there! No ""Swing"", ""Taking Islands in Africa"", or ""Sons of Pioneers"" (one of my fave Japan tracks) - it's also missing an instrumental track. It's a shame because some of the flavor is lost. Still, this is great music and a reasonable introduction for people new to Japan. I just wish record companies would stop releasing truncated versions of albums - is it really that much more expensive to keep everything intact?"
5,Beautiful boot!,"I purchased these boots after reading the other review and I am very happy I did! These boots run true to size, they are very stylish and very comfortable. The buckle really makes the boot, the suede is soft and the heel height is just right."
5,Outstanding book in a rare field,"For a topic as erudite as terrestrial mycology this is an excellent book for nearly any snail enthusiest. Although it is geared mostly toward the scientific community, amateurs should find it very useful. It classifies more than 2,000 species of landsnails in scientific order giving their name, scientific name, who first published them, size, where they are (were) found, and a colored photo. This book unfortunately seems to be too rare but anyone who can get a copy should find it invaluable in identifying many exotic snail species."
4,Nice!,"This is probably still the best source for land shell pictures. Unfortunately, the taxonomy of snail species are changing frequently, so some of the species' names are outdated. That is why I don't rate it six stars. Personally, I'd also lik more pictures of live snails."
4,Well Done,"I'm glad I took a chance on this unknown author. The book was well-written, entertaining with interesting characters. Believe it or not, I read the whole thing in one sitting."
4,"Needed editing, but a decent read","Yes, there are a ton of typos and grammatical errors. And the cover art was just horrible. However, I really liked this book. The characters worked for me; the story worked for me; and I was left hoping for a sequel that will likely never be.I think that I'd recommend that you buy this used, as this is a POD and thus waaaaaay overpriced for what you get. Sorry, but like most PODs that is the unfortunate truth.But don't write this off as not worth reading if you can tolerate the lack of editing."
1,poorly written vamp tale,"i read just about anything - this time, it was a curse instead of a blessing. i SUFFERED through 'blood is thicker than water' to prove to myself that the book was not as poorly written as the first few pages lead me to believe. the plot was weak, the characters were annoying, and it had enough pop culture references (star trek, etc) to fill my lifetime.i bought this book based on the winning reviews it received on amazon, but i am now of the strong opinion that those reviewers must have been the author's family and friends offering kind words of praise. anyone with an ounce of honesty would have posted a more accurate review. save your money and take my word for it - it was truly unreadable."
1,Tuscany,This CD is not what I expected. Classic italian songs mixed with some operatic selections. I would have preferred one or the other. Certainly a must to preview before ordering.
5,Madonna ROCKS the house with DANCE & POP tunes!!!,"This BOX SET version of Madonna's recent album ""Music"" is really great & cool! The BOX includes 2 CD-SET: The first one includes the traditional track listing for the album ""Music"" (10 tracks) and the second one includes The Remixes of hit-singles released from this album ""Music, ""Don't Tell Me"" & ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"".Track Listings Compact Disc One:1.

2,Missing Walker,"The woman of the title is nowhere to be found. If you are looking for wilderness adventure, as I was, you will be disappointed. Pybus has almost no information on Lillian Alling's life or supposed epic hike to Siberia. In fact, she doesn't even know her name. Lillian Alling is largely a guess. In the end, she finds a few tidbits and one first hand account and from that weaves a wispy fairy tale. What the reader finds instead is an often fascinating, if unintended self-portrait of the author -- a woman frightened by wilderness and unable to comprehend anything beyond her own limited and narrow world view. As when she mocks rural Americans or expresses ""astonishment"" that readers of Jon Krakauer's ""Into the Wild"" see anything more than hubris in Krakauer's protagonist.The interactions between her, her travel companion, and her thoughts along the way are mesmerizing, if often painful."
3,Windows-Only (Propietary Format when Recording Voice),"The gadget looks cute (the interface is kind of cheesy, butit's a minor problem), but I couldn't really test it. It usesits own propietary format (ACT) to record voice, instead ofMP3. The software seems to include a Windows-only ACT->MP3converter. Linux/FreeBSD fans should look for something else."
3,"Great band, not their best album.","I really like Kome Kome Club, especially their funk. The closest western band I can think of that they are like is Ooingo Boingo. But, most of the songs on this album sound like lounge music or generic pop. It lacks the spunk of most of their other music. The few funk songs on the album are boring compared to, say, ""FUNK FUJIYAMA"" from the album 5 1/2, which just went out of print in 2000. This album does have the very popular song ""Kimi Ga Iru Dake De"", which I don't like. So if you enjoy that song, this album may be perfect for you. Personally, I will await the re-releases of Sharisharism, EBIS, Go Funk, 5 1/2, K2C, Kome Kome Club, and their last album, Pushed Rice."
1,don't bother,"This isn't a good book. Frankly, I'm surprized that there are any good reviews of this book. The storyline, the characters are all shallow and empty. I found some of the instances in the book to be down right rediculous. Overall, the writing was poor and immature. Don't buy it."
1,MINUS 20 STARS,I found this book to be disgusting. She must hate Sicilians to write such trash about them. The woman has no writing skills.
1,"""La Cisterna""","It is a rarity for me not to enjoy a book about romance, about Italy, or about food, so this seemed like heaven when I read the description. I must agree that the heroine is portrayed as rather uncomely, and is stereoptyped as the ""old maid"" who hides herself in books and finds joy only in food. This story was UNbelievable and silly - trying to be a take off on the exquisite ""Like Water for Chocolate"" just does not work for this authoress. I was on a six hour plane ride and read the entire book by time we were at the halfway point and was BORED by the end. Do not waste your lire!"
3,slow roasted and under pressure,"When I first began reading this book, I was wondering why my friend suggested it. Outrageous descriptions, and difficult to follow, even though Prior gave a table of characters, they were meaningless without reading further. It got better in the middle, as if a new writer had taken over, so the plot was better understood. 3/4th's thru the writer begins fast forwarding and seems to skip pertinent information again. I am a passionate cook who believes in the powerful sensuality food can have on your love life. Noble first effort, but lacks authenticity of imagination when describing ""body dining"". Not flattering to people who are passionate about all things fair in love and what's eatable!"
2,Not sure I liked it,Definitely written for Italians. Very hard to understand with all the Italian names and areas. The first 5 chapters were very boring. Would not buy this again.
2,"Pretty bad, but the setting/food are great","I loved Like Water for Chocolate and other novels in the magical realism genre, but this one doesn't measure up. The pace is jerky (and what's the spring, summer, etc structure all about?), the texture all wrong (she gives equal weight to everything that happens to the heroine so that when events occur that are supposed to be significant, you have no idea why), and there is a distance between the reader and the main characters. Some of the writing is just laughably bad (""Why did he go? When would he be back? Would she ever know who he was?""). This woman really, really needs writing lessons and a good editor. Sicily sounds fab though, and Prior certainly seems to know her Sicilian cooking."
4,A beautifully written unusual book,"I did not expect to like this book. A friend reccomended it and so I thought I would try it. I a glad I did. The story concerns Rosa Fiore, a woman who copes with her pain, her triumphs and her loves in life with cooking. The book is remarkably sensual and very tastefully done."
4,A Feast of Passions,"La Cucina is a delightful novel of food and love. Our heroine, Rosa, is a masterful cook but naive in the ways of love. After losing the love of her youth, Rosa moves away from the family farm and moves to the city of Palermo, where she works for twenty-five years as a librarian. Her only love is food and cooking, until one day, a stranger walks into the library, L'Inglese, and steals her heart.Rosa teaches L'Inglese the secrets of the Sicilian kitchen, and L'Inglese teaches her the secrets of love. Together, they share great passion for food and love, until one day, L'Inglese disappears. Rosa is devastated, because in Sicily, when someone disappears, they are often dead. After a terrible fire in her apartment, her brothers bring her back to the family farm, and Rosa begins her life anew.This is a lush, full, story. Reminiscent of Like Water for Chocolate, La Cucina celebrates love, food, and family."
3,Disappointed,"Prior describes the art of Sicilian cooking with such detail that aromas and tastes seem to leap off the page. Beyond that, however, I found the plot disappointing. Some events in the story line seem contrived, others seems to be included only to add a surprising twist, with no relevance to the story. Most of the characters are one-dimensional, with the exception of Rosa. Many of the characters are not fully developed. I found this to be a mediocre read."
4,"If you loved ""Like Water for Chocolate"". . .","Another great read that combines passion with food in a very passionate, mystical way. This was a fun read, and I had it finished in 2 days. If you've read ""Like Water for Chocolate"", or ""Chocolat"", and enjoyed them, add this one to your list. . .it's very good and has a plot to boot! I might have given it 5 stars had the parts about butchering the animals for dinner had not been so graphic, I found that upsetting and not necessary for the story."
3,"Good start, but the end of the book got a little crazy...","I want to rate this book a bit higher, but the end of it really ruined it for me. The majority of the book (up to page 207 or so) went rather well, with interesting plot and well-written descriptions of food and the characters. Some of the more explicit scenes got a bit silly, but that was ok. However, towards the end of the book, I felt like the whole book went into some sort of fastforward mode. So many major things happened all of a sudden, and there wasn't necessarily anything to build up to them. The plot started jumping ahead quite a bit, and it really ruined the rest of the book for me. I feel like perhaps the author was on a roll while writing the first 200 or so pages, and then had a case of writer's block and just threw the last 60+ pages together so she could finish the book. If you can somehow overlook this, then the rest of the book is really delightful though."
1,"silly, clumsily written trash","This is possibly the worst novel I have read in decades. The characters are either silly cartoonish sterotypes dreamed up by an apparently ignorant foreigner or just plain bizarre. Yet I don't think the book was intended as pure farce. It's pretentious enough to be sprinkled with totally unnecessary and distracting fragments of sentences in ""Italian,"" but so sloppy that the ""Italian"" is not even written correctly. (And no, these so-called Italian sentences aren't in correct Sicilian either. They're just an incorrect mess.) The plot is crudely constructed, the writing is clumsy, the characters silly, the dialogue just terrible, and all in all, it reads like a young teen's first attempt at creative writing. Was there no editor? Awful, awful trash."
2,blah,"I found the writing weak and the story was not interesting enough for me care about the characters. The cooking segments went on too long and the writer was relying on these long descriptions to carry the story. Sorry, none of it worked for me."
1,Wish I had read the reviews,"Based on an office mate's raving about how wonderful this book was, I ordered it. However, I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before doing so. I couldn't get past the first page! I'm returning it. I would write more but others before me have already said everything quite eloquently."
4,Bad Directing and writing but entertaining,"The director should never be allowed to do another film again. And the writing was awful. The blonde actress was hot and might have had a chance in another film but the script was so stupid NO ONE could pull it off. The rest of cast was really bad and a few not so easy on the eyes - especially the therapist. Ouch. I did however find it entertaining. If this was sold as a dark comedy it would have been awesome. The writer, producer and director took themselves way too serious. I've seen worse films. If you turn it on mute it's actually pretty good. Very bad script and even worse directing is what the problem was here."
1,High School Quality ! Dont waste your money.,"Dont waste your time, or money on this one. High school acting, and film work. For those that gave this 5 stars, I can only wonder what they were thinking !"
4,Tired of all the crap music out there these days?,"Check out Marcus Eaton and the Lobby. These guys can play the hell out of their instruments and jam with the best of them. A must see live band, and 4 incredibly nice guys. You will not be disappointed."
4,"Great Cd, reminds me alittle of Dave Mathews","SAw this group in concert, they were GREAT, picked up their CD and it didn't disapoint. If you like DMB, and great lyrics pick this one up."
4,Great sounds from this inventive group,"Saw them opening for Train, the audience was blown away. Bought the cd that night, have shared with many. Buy this, get these guys some air play. They should be heard!!! NOT a COPY BAND!!"
1,poor showing,"Very disapointing, they did not come with a wooden block, as stated in the discription. It is plastic.J.A. Henckels International Forged Premio 13-Piece Block Setpoor showing They looked very cheap. If I had opened the box and looked, I would never had given this as a gift."
1,Worst knife set ever,I purchased these less than a year ago. Washed them by hand just like all the other Henckel knife sets I have had and they all have pretty much rusted.Great price but not worth it. I am now looking for something that will last longer. The whole rust proof and all that is crap. One even broke and I am not that hard on knives. I have a previous knife I kept from the last set the big blade and that has lasted me 5 years.
4,Very pleased with our knives!,"My boyfriend and I are setting up our first post-college kitchen and picked these knives as a nice mid-range option. We've been very happy with them, especially the hollow-edged santoku. Unlike some of the other reviewers we haven't had any problems with rust; when the knives are washed and dried promptly, it's really not an issue. The only caveats we have are that the handles are a little light (but you get used to that, and the quality of the blade is what matters) and that the steak knives are not that useful, partly because they're not serrated, mostly because we don't eat steak. I could also wish for another paring knife, but that's a very minor complaint. 4-5 stars - I'd've done 4 1/2 if I could."
2,Great if you like RUSTY knives,"These knives cut okay, not great, but okay. They are not the sharpest knives, but I have used worse. The biggest problem is that I bought them about a year and a half ago and they pretty much started rusting immediately. Every single knife has rust on it and I just couldn't stand it any longer so I bought replacements (Wusthof...worth the $$$).These are not Henckels knives made in Germany, these are a cheaper version made in China - if you are buying for the name...save yourself the hassle and your money."
3,Just ok.,Had to return these knives twice due to rust they are not stainless steel like they should be. I was barely lucky enough to get my money back.
2,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"The quality is poor and the product is weak. In two months the rust will destroy your knives. Don`t buy it, are terrible!"
1,Dont waste your money,"Don't waste your money, knives will start rusting after first wash. Very disappointed. If anyone can recommend a good knife set please let me know."
1,Cheap,"I should have read the reviews before ordering. Some of the reviews regarding the thickness of the knives blades are correct. The knife blades are pretty thin and flimsy, they bend with little effort. I got a $30.00 20 year old set that has better craftmanship then this set and the blades are thicker and more sturdy, not nearly as flimsy as this set. I have not used this set yet and wont be, I will be returning it. It is simply and over priced, fancy looking cheap knife set with a brand name on it associated with fine kitchen cutlery."
2,"Good Price, Low Quality","This is certainly a ""beginner"" set. The set is rather light weight and the blades are thin and flexible. The rubberized feel of the handle combined with the brushed aluminum makes it look modern, but takes away from the classic feel Henckels has built its name on. I would encourage you to spend a little more and get a heavier weight and quality set."
1,Cheap knives,"These knives are exactly what I'd call ""made in china"" for quality. My last knife set was from job lot for $20 and they were of far superior quality. These knives are flimsy and poorly crafted. NEVER BUY THEM!"
3,it does the job,"The knives work well, however, they are already getting rust spots and I've only had them a couple of months."
2,J.A. Henckels International 15707-000 Synergy 17-piece Knife Block,"The knife blades are thin, the knife block which was part of the 17 piece knife block set actually has three(3)extra knife holes and a extra misc.retangular hole after all the knives are put into the block, making the knife set appear to be incomplete. I put the whole thing in my junk drawer after recieving it. Not worth the hassle of returning."
3,Henckel Knife set,This product was what I expected. The only exception was when I purchased the kitchen shears they didn't fit into the block very well.
1,RUSTED!!!,"These are supposed to be stainless steel, but they rusted the first time I ran them through the dishwasher!!! All of them did!"
3,17 pc. Knives,"J. A. Henckel International Fine Edge Synergy 17 piece Knives are Designed Nice & Very sharp, but alot lighter than expected for higher end cutler."
1,Unfortunante.,"Once again I thought I bought a German product, but I was wrong. These knives were made with Chinese steel and they rust.Not impressed."
3,Not as well made as I thought,I got this as a set to replace my Chicago knife set and this set looked like a boning knife that I bought a couple of years ago. These knifes are very light and have a cheap feel to them. They seem to work ok but do not feel durable in my hand
2,Sharp but very thin,"I got these knives for XMas and I feel obligated to write a review. They are beautiful and sharp! They are so thin that when I pulverize garlic with it feels like the knife will snap in two. I also learned that they stain very easily. I am not the cleanest of cooks so my knives are not washed and dried immediately after using them. They may sit out until after dinner and then drip dry in the dish tray. First night I had them I used them and found the stains. Unless you are a dainty, OCD chef I would consider a different set. To be honest, and I'm an Amazon fan, I don't think I would buy knives online unless I have touched them and know exactly what I want.Happy cooking!"
1,Rust problems,"These are a beautiful set of knives with a good edge and a good weight to them. The only problem is they rust after just a couple washes. Even if you dry them right away, you'll see rust start to appear on them. Will be returning these defective products."
1,Knives will rust,"My husband bought this nice looking knife set a couple of months ago since our 25 year old set was in need of a change. At first glance the set looked great. It has all the necessary items, and it was a good price.Using the knives is another story. The chef and carving knives have a flat blade, making cutting difficult (I prefer a slightly curved blade for easy chopping/slicing). In addition, all blades are serrated, and I like smooth blades. The metal of the blades are also fairly thin.That said, after the first dishwashing of the steak knives, the blades became very rusty. If you want to hand wash and dry each piece immediately, this won't be an issue - but for the rest of us that use a dishwasher, I would stay away from this set."
4,nice but.....,"Love the knives, but be careful. I thought that the block had a knife for each of it's slots. Not so. I did receive all of the knives it claimed to include but there are still some empty slots that need to be filled. SO! That means I have to go and buy a few more in order to complete the set. Bummer. Oh well. no big deal, I guess."
1,Waste of Money,"I thought getting a set of Henckel knives meant i was getting quality. Nothing could be further from the truth, with this set at least. Two key problems: One, the knives have begun to rust in spite of the facts that they are hand washed and dried each time they are used and they are only about 3 months used. Two, they have gone completely dull. Not a quality product, and I will not buy Henckels ever again."
1,"disappointed, poor quality, stain easily","these knives are sharp, work well, but started to spot almost immediately. they are all now stained, from regular washing in a washing machine. frustrating."
3,FIRST IMPRESSION,"I just received these knives yesterday, so I cant give a long term review. They feel very light (cheap) in the hand. The blades are fairly sharp, the chef's knife is flimsy and did not even cut a piece of paper right from the box. I am a little disappointed in the quality, they also have a ""made in China"" stamped in the blade. If I had paid full price for these, I would have been very upset, I almost feel like I lost my money and only spent 90."
1,Cheap Knives!,"I am very unhappy with this set. I previously owned a $10 set and this knife set is not much better. I was really hoping to cut through an onion, butternut squash, sweet potatoes, ect seamlessly but these knives make food preparation extremely difficult, frustrating & time consumming! Now I realize that you have to pay a high price for a good set. I cannot wait to receive our new set of CUTCO!!"
4,Quality Henckels,"Since I am not a professional chef, I was not looking for a top of the line Henckels set. I wanted a set that was functional,good looking and reasonably priced. This 17 piece set fit the bill nicely. I have read some of the other reviews which mention rusting and dullness. I have not encountered any of these problems. It is true that any quality steel will rust if water is left on it,but with care the knives will not rust. They remain sharp as the day I got them and I use them frequently. One note though, they really are not diswasher safe but just as I would not put my Lenox china in the diswasher, I would not subject any quality cutlery to the brutality of the diswasher. If you are a ""Family Chef"" like me, buy this set."
4,excellent value!,"Great set- came exaclty as described. This is a very good set for someone who does a good amount of cooking and likes a good set of knives. For the price, I think this is the best overall value, comes with the steak knives and all other necessary knives for pretty much any type of cooking. They are very sharp and have a good edge, balance and overall quality. The only thing that I think could improve this set is if it came with kitchen shears. I highly reccomend this set to everyone."
4,BETTER THE WUSTHOF CHEAPER SETS,I research and go way out of my way to buy quality products. I just purchased the wusthof gourmet set and these knifes feel way better.!!!!
4,90% Good,There is no space between the knives so getting them out is a little bit of a hassle. I have had no problems so far but will update if things change.
4,Had this product one month from a year now.,"This is exactly what the picture suggests. Although if you look close enough there are empty slots, such as the scissor slot. I have found that J.A. Henckels does this so that you have expansion room. As the title suggests I have had this set for close to a year now and I have filled those expansion slots with a mikado santoku, a classic twin chef's and a pair of Henckels scissors. They are, however, the SYNERGY set. I did not understand this and thought they were fake. Synergy has black rubber handles with a steel plate on the top of the handle, the blade IS forged steel and is extremely strong. I rate this a four only because the article I bought this from did not mention the slots, and it is not what i expected as far as Henckels (when i think Henckels i think of the classic style.) But this is not the sellers fault, i should have looked at what synergy set meant."
2,A good set for the kitchen,"This has been a great set for our kitchen and our basic every day needs. Also the steak knives are great and comfortable in the hand.Well checking in 6mos later and updating my rating, as this set has become disappointing for sure, as the blades are rusting ! Even my ""Seen on TV Ginzu knife"" in my junk drwaer which is 10yrs old has not rused"
4,Easy to maneuver Workhorse,"Bought the Milwaukee 44915 hand truck for several reasons.1) Made in USA. For me that means quality construction and, if needed, being able to contact the manufacturer.2) Large weight capacity. This truck is being used in my vintage furniture refinishing / sales business. At 800 lbs. capacity, it is doubtful that I'll come up against anything that can't be moved with the 44915.3) Large tires. This makes moving items, even over uneven lawns, floors, etc. very easy.3) The D-handle allows one hand use so it is easier to close a door while still balancing a load.4) Large toe plate. This simply makes carrying large or odd sized object a bit easier.5) Fold-down accessory bar. Great for carrying boxes or lighter furniture - but still heavy duty.This is a well made, heavy duty hand truck that is still relatively light weight and easy to maneuver. Amazon Customer Service was very helpful in providing extra detail about the construction. Fast delivery, too. I'm very satisfied."
1,"Book was defective, but customer service from BWB was great.","The book I ordered from Better World Books was in unacceptable condition, which was a disappointment. However, I am writing to share that BWB had excellent customer service and immediately refunded my purchase.Thank you!"
1,Not the real thing,I've used Calgon Vanilla Swirl body mist for some time now. It is a very prominent vanilla/cotton candy kinda of smell. The product I received from this seller....HAS NO SMELL! I'm very upset and would really love to get my money back...but don't know how to do that
3,Not what I was expecting,"This smell is not what I was expecting, all in all it's a good smell. I spray it on the carpets and curtains, not on me. Not a smell I want on my body, guess I am just picky."
4,"If you're cheap and uneducated, this is the book for you",If you don't have money to spare but you're looking for a college education (or at least the degree) this book tellls you all you need to know. I got my degree for less than the $12000 it cost my brother. This book told me how and it will tell you how also. I would highly reccommend this book to you and anyone else.
3,"great setting, shaky plot","While some of the plot twists in this fast-paced Victorian novel are utterly suprising (and yet well hinted-at, in retrospect), others are disappointingly obvious. And the reason for 12-year-old Mog's curiousity in the complex schemes of shady thieves is hard to understand, despite its fortuitous result.But I did love the setting in the book. The scenes in the printer's shop where Mog is apprenticed are delightfully full of lead type and presses, and the crowded, grungy 19th-century London streets are alluring and exciting. The dialog is occasionally difficult to understand but full of colorful words and phrases that flesh out the atmosphere perfectly."
1,A Waste of Time,"In The Printer's Devil, Bajoria has strung together a confusing, unlikely and almost random sequence of events producing a ""plot"" that fails to provide either satisfaction or resolution. As for the sequel--I don't think so! Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
3,"Great movies, good deal, big problem...","This was a great deal and I'm glad that I picked them up, the big problem though came with the packaging. The two movies were shrink wrapped together and in the shrink wrap there was a stick hold the two together. It was impossible to get the sticker off without ripping the covers of the two cases!!! BIG THUMBS DOWN TO THAT. The movies are great though."
1,"Impressive Career, Disappointing Life Story","Mr. Welch was clearly a very fortunate businessman. He managed to leverage his good fortune with a style of leadership which maintained GE's strong status. I was sadden, however, with how he dealt with his life. Almost everything Mr. Welch writes of deals with powerful yet simple business concepts and a tiresome list of acquisitions and divestitures. I'd like to understand more of Mr. Welch as a human being - not the simple-minded businessman who dismisses his relationship with his first wife in a page. Although the book seems to indicate otherwise, I hope his life meant more than GE."
3,Neither a good biography nor a management book,"This book is quite disappointing, either as an autobiography or as a management book. Maybe I put a lot of hype on this book (I assume the book is terrific as the publisher spent US$ 7 million to secure the right to publish this book).As an autobiography, Jack Welch covered only a minimal amount of his personal life, most of pages of the book are devoted for his life at GE (which I think is exactly what the readers want). However, even as a management book, there is no in-depth analysis and discussion. Quite a dry book.Particularly I like Section 2 (Building A Philosophy) and Section 3 (Ups and Downs). Section 1 is okay, section 4 and 5 are a little bit boring.If you want to know more about Jack, this is a book for you, but if you want to know more about his moves during his tenure, I think Robert Slater's books are more interesting."
5,Guru....absolutely....Guru,Explendid work....or I should say explendid LIFE !Jack takes us to the very deep of corporate life with its ups and downs without loosing one single chance on giving good lessons...You wont be able to quit until you finish it !
2,Bottom Line: Execute,"It's a mildly interesting read, but I'm not sure it's worth the time. All you walk away with, really, is an understanding of the fact that execution matters.To be fair, there's only so much to be said for a guy who inherited a very strong balance sheet and a huge management team (where hiring clearly matters less than trimming the fat).So, instead of the 'how' (basically strong management techniques forcefully applied), it answers the 'what'. Which is why the book reads like a list of initiatives rather than how they were conceived. (Bizarre for someone who clearly prides himself on shaping the creative chaos of emotionally charged team meetings.)Anyway, it's an easy to read, albeit poorly written (repetitive). And, as other reviewers have pointed out, overly resplendent with instances of name dropping GE's executives, various golf courses, hotels, buildings etc."
4,Jack I thought you would write it,well written but the question that runsd in my head is who wrote it the initial few chapters on his parents etc is very very absorbing rest it reads like a ghost written book the issue being that it has all the relevant infoermation of wht happened but the personal touch is more than missing .....any way if you are fascinated by the man and the company he managed a brilliant pick ...atleast with the man's blessing himself .. though i still wonder who wrote it...
2,Not the best...........,"I found Jack to be a little over powering. I was waiting for the leap tall buildings line. Not only did I find this book to be hard reading but I also think any company with respect for their employees and realistic objectives for their management teams thought this was logic, not a revelation."
3,Listen to what Jack Wech wants to say,"I've met Jack Welch in Pasadena few weeks after the book came out. Jack Welch just confirmed his keen intellect,"" tough"" guy fame but he discussed with passion about Six Sigma, one of initiatives he championed together with globalization and e-business. This book though is not the textbook on Welch Style of Management but is a good inside in some of his thinking and approaches. This book is for those who want to listen to what he wants to say."
2,A Terrible Man in Terrible Times,"It's hard to separate the man from the book. The book itself is little more than an account of where he went and what he did, with the rare nanosecond of self-doubt always followed by self-vindication and congratulation. He could have had his diary published and gotten much the same results.However, what he did to GE and its employees is loathsome. The unbridled avarice and lack of concern for anything but the bottom line injured thousands and likely killed hundreds. I am astounded that people hold him up as a paragon of the modern businessman.Jack Welch, Robert Allen of AT&T;, Lou Gerstner of IBM are only a handful of the hundreds of greed-driven, ego-ridden businessmen who more than exemplify Gordon Gecko's motto that ""Greed is good."" God have mercy on their souls."
1,Hollow Man,"Jack Welch is no secret he was in the right place at the right time. His business success has nothing to do with good management. There are a thousand Jack Welch's in this world and most of the end up no where. Jack gambled and he won. But to my main point, this guy is soulless. He cares nothing for what is important in life. Greed and power are his middle name. People and humanity be dammed. It makes me sad to think that people aspire to be this man. Here is a poem that in my mind sums up Jack Welch's life. T.S. Elliot 'sHollow MenWe are the hollow menWe are the stuffed menLeaning togetherHeadpiece filled with straw. Alas!Our dried voices, whenWe whisper togetherAre quiet and meaninglessAs wind in dry grassOr rats' feet over broken glassIn our dry cellarShape without form, shade without colour,Paralysed force, gesture without motion;Those who have crossedWith direct eyes, to death's other KingdomRemember us--if at all--not as lostViolent souls, but onlyAs the hollow menThe stuffed men."
2,"A ""classic"" which may not be ""current""","Jack Welch is an astounding leader, and his book reveals his style with punch and clarity. Many have written of how important this book is for CEOs and upandcomers to read.However, as a female CEO, I was disappointed. He did not reference a female professional he respected until a third into the book. Women in leadership roles are ""necessary projects"" for him, not something he would support of his own initiative. He glossed over the role his wife of 28 years played in allowing him to succeed.Overall, Jack is still worth reading, but I would hope that current managers do not emulate him entirely. If so, we'll move back to the era of the good ole boys playing golf all the time."
3,A curveball,Some may question whether these captains of industry mean us good or ill in the final analysis. I myself just question their phenomenal self-love.
1,I feel icky just touching the book,"In light of the new news, should the book be called ""Jack: Straight from My Bed?"" It's nice when a ""hero"" of business shows his true colors. So ""Neutron Jack"" now known for not only his temper and his firms manufacture of nuclear triggers has a little problem with keeping ""little Jack"" at bay - what's the big deal, everyone is doing it right? Ken Lay, Global Crossing, etc. those are the bad guys, right? Not some guy who can't stay faithful to his wife, that's not unethical.Enough said, if you want to worship this ""person"" feel free...."
2,"Oh boy, another arrogant CEO writes a book,","Anyone who has met this guy and then read this book could quickly see through the superman image. Give any number of good managers the position he had with enough great talent sucking up to you, and sure, many people could get results. Similar results, maybe not, because the guy is clearly talented, but, come on, is he really the stuff we should be putting on a pedestal. I don't think there is really anything new or surprising in this book. Save your time and money-- simply read the reviews."
5,Great Book!,"Jack Welch is the consummate business leader of our time. This book gives great insight into the thought processes that led to his success by revealing what and who shaped his life from childhood to retirement. Sure, much of Jack Welch is ""over the top"" but isn't that what we would expect?"
3,I am almost ashamed to keep this book on our shelves,"I must say I am disappointed in this book. Mr W. clearly takes much credit for the success of GE. Although a strong leader in any organization can make a big difference, it looks disgustingly fake when he tries to take all credit for success. If you are a critical reader you will most likely see through the tireless self promotion that went on with W.I cannot waste any more time on this book, so I must end this review here, but there are good parts of this book. To find out about those, read someone else's reviews."
2,Tad Boring,Welch talks himself up too much and does not look at his weaknesses. Wouldn't buy this is give the rich guy more money -- he has more than enough.
2,Bla bla bla bla.........,Well...the first few chapters were excellent!!! What a brilliant guy but that book could have been condensed into half of what they printed!!! He continued to say the same things over and over again...until I finally had to put him back on the shelf...unfinished!
2,Jack: Its all about Me!,"If your looking for ideas from this book, from the master of ideas, this book falls way short. But if your interested in reading about Jack talking about Jack, then this book is for you.My suggestion to the person reading the book to obtain ideas, I would borrow a copy and then skip the first 100 pages. The middle section (approximately 100 pages) are quite good, especially the chapter about ""the people"".Stop again, when he starts discussing the various GE acquistions, as the art of each deal is missing.Sorry, Jack, but your book doesn't due the work you did at GE justice."
2,Where is your soul?,"I was a little disappointed by the focus of this book. I was expecting a little humanity and meaning in this tale of an extraordinary businessman. I hope that when the epitaph is carved on his gravestone it says more than ""I bought and sold Companies"" The lessons that are set forth in this book are not those that I would want my children to live their lives by. Being successful financially does not have to come at the expense of having a soul and valuing and honoring your family and community."
3,Too Long,"There is some good information in here, but it is far too long to be required reading for my management teams. The pertinent messages are too hard to pick out of the unabridged version."
1,Straight From the Butt,"I could not believe that I wasted my $$ on this book. I read through it very painfully searching for something worth reading about, but ended up wasting my time and money."
3,To bad it is from the GUT and not from the brain,"This is a 380+ page book that should have been 250. The first half is better than the last half. Jack says that there are A,B and C people - the A's being the top 20%. Jack's book gets a solid B."
3,"I gave a good review, but...","I gave a good review on this book before with 4 or 5 stars. But I'm giving only 3 now. First half of the book is 5 stars. It's encouraging and exciting stories. But last half of the book is about what he did -- and what all he did once he became a CEO of GE is merging! And he keeps go on and on with names of people, values, where, what has been merged. I didn't know CEO's job is buying out companies, and he sure taught me that in last half of the book. If you will get this book and I recommend so, but don't waste your time reading the last half. You'll see what I mean."
2,"Straight from the gut, and not always palatable","I picked up this book because I want to know more about GE, an American industrial icon, and its legendary leader, Mr. Jack Welch. The one thing I like about Welch is that he talked in a very straightforward and candid manner, although at times he appeared rather defensive. You may not agree with his management philosophies, but keep in mind that this is an autobiography rather than a management text. As I read along, I was somehow reminded of Al Dunlap, the discredited former CEO of Sunbeam Corporation. I observed that Welch and Dunlap are similar in a few ways. Both come across as having over-sized egos, are highly authoritarian, paternalistic and often ruthless. The big difference laid in the bottom line of the corporation each ran, but do not forget that Dunlap used to be a favourite of Wall Street too."
2,Egomaniacal ranting!,"As someone who has served as chairman of a publicly-traded company, I had a considerable amount of respect for Jack Welch before I read this book.Upon reading it and learning something of his personality, I discovered that he seems like a profoundly insecure, self-absorbed little man. Talk about a vaccuous personality! Of course I can appreciate his professional accomplishments at GE, but I can also respect those of IBM's Louis Gerstner, who doesn't need to wallow in hundreds of pages of self-congratulatory drivel. Alternatively, give me founder/innovators like a Bill Gates or a Steve Case, who, incidentally, avoid the limelight unless it's thrust upon them to further their aspirations. To me, this book represents the embarrassingly pathetic ramblings of a soft-handed cookie-cutter corporate executive for whom a game of golf is about as creative as it gets. Simply put, ""Jack"" is a rather uninteresting book about a notably uninteresting person."
2,No epiphanies here,"Obviously ghost-written, this book is only of interest to those with minimal business experience. It's purpose is to make you think that Jack Welch never made a mistake. So all you GE stockholders, listen up!To those who DO have business experience, you already know that there are loads of errors, infighting and intrigue in a company the size of GE. If you expect to read about them here, you won't.If you're looking for new business concpets, try a Guy Kawasaki book. If you want to read about business strategy, read Kenichi Ohmae. If you're at Business 101 level and can tell when you're reading ad copy, try this book."
2,A bloated 1 Minute Manager,"My dad and I can argue about this one all night long! He thinks the sun rises and sets on this book. There are indeed some wonderful tips on how to manage a business at the very back of the book, but the rest of his ghost-authored book is a puffed-up piece of boring golf course self-indulgence that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy."
3,Jack - Straight from the Gut,"This book exhibits Jack's extraordinary rememberance and recolection of times and events in his life. It seemed as if they were happening as the story unfolded. This autobiography proves that it takes a long time and a lot of hard work to make it to the top in a company as large as General Electric. The style of writing used in this book is very unique, although the storyline did seem to ""drag"" in places. Overall, I would rate this book at three stars because of it lacking climaxes."
5,Excellent,"This book is one of those which transform your vision about your company CEO and about the whole company. As manager, I enjoyed it very much and learned A LOT."
1,One of the worst books ever written,"I was forced to buy and read this 500+ page book for my Intro to Business class. I usually like reading pretty much anything, but this book is unbearable. The author is so full of himself and constantly throws around names, places and dates of every little meaningless event. It's very distracting when you're trying to read the story and learn something out of it. People, stay away from this book like the plague. I did learn a few things about GE, but nothing I wouldn't have learned reading its Wikipedia entry, but that was after I learned to weed through the BS.If you want to read something entertaining, this is not the book to read. If you love unimportant dates, want to learn the names of GE workers, and read a guy brag about himself, you'll love this book."
3,Pedestrian Business Autobiography,"Jack is entirely too long. Welch makes the mistake of trying to give a narrative of his entire career instead of organizing the book around a central theme and cutting the fluff. It's the sections dealing specifically with his managerial successes at GE. None of the methods he applied at GE were groundbreaking. But there is something to seeing them in action. Perhaps Welch's greatest contribution was the discipline and rigor he brought to the execution of those methods. Sadly, Welch has no non-business wisdom to impart. His first marriage was a failure, and as we now know so was his second."
3,Great Manager; Mediocre Book,"Jack Welch has a lot of interesting lessons he could have taught based on his outstanding career. Unfortunately, this book ends up being a long, anecdotal memoir that feels like it was rushed to print without sufficient editing. Lots of superflous details about golfing buddies and dinner parties; not enough about his innovations like ""Six Sigma"". Disappointing."
2,Dull and irrelevant. What a disappointment.,"This is Jack's book: ""then George and I did this great thing; I knew he would be great; that's the value of Six Sigma.""Repeat."
2,"A ""rushed"" book that could have been much better","Jack was actually interesting for the first few chapters, but then the author seemed to lose interest and just got through it, obsessing on himself. His time at GE was not put into historical context,i.e., the fall of the Berlin Wall and communism, the boom of the 90s--from which he profited greatly, terrorism attacks, etc. It's a very inward look at GE and everything that he personally did there, with lots of ""I""s in th text. In the early part of the book I liked the main character, but by the end he came across as an egomaniac. Certainly not a great leader. Dissapointing."
1,Such a boring book,"One reads books like this to get insights, knowledge, and inspiration. Welch talked and talked and talked and I learned nothing. It is when I finally got completely fed up with his self-aggrandizing narration that I realized the only insight of the book seems to be: companies, especially gigantic ones with many levels of executives, tend to be very resilient (of pointy-hair boss errors). Unless the CEO is *really* stupid, he/she can't really screw up that bad. They are largely irrelevant. (I don't know if the statement is true or not. But that's what the book reads like to me.)Of course, if your goal is to climb the corporate ladder, you might draw much more than I did."
2,"I admire Jack Welch, but not this book.","I excitedly read this book in preparation for a visit from Jack Welch to the business school I was attending. However, I was pretty disappointed.I do admire Jack Welch, but this book can be summed up into about four lines, which repeat throughout the book:There was a huge problem/opportunity at GE.Jack Welch fired/hired the right person.Problem solved! Opportunity realized!Jack Welch is the greatest.I give it two stars instead of one because many of the stories are interesting, and I do think hiring the right people and managing them effectively is underemphasized in business management studies."
1,Blech,"I've seen the managerial techniques espoused by Neutron Jack in practise. In my experience, they're destructive, resulting in lowered productivity and morale. If you're looking for effective management advice, look to the works of Edwards Deming."
3,Great read but nothing new,"I actually got a little depressed by reading this book. Great advice - work hard, be yourself, and enjoy what you are doing. I know a lot of people that works hard and try to be themselves but most do not get ahead. There are some good messages for leaders or executives. I find especially interesting on the various initiatives and how to make them work or stick."
5,"First, you debrief, then you read Jack","If you are a C type person, employee or in general, first you get a tape recorder and a package of tapes. Then you sit and go through all the reasons you haven't succeeded. You complain about your mother, your father, your dysfunctional family,about your addictions, about your bad luck, about how you have suffered more than most people, etc. etc. For as long as it takes, just you pour out your guts to the tape recorder. Then play it back and listen. When you get tired of hearing yourself, give yourself a hug and see that after all is said and done, you are still alive and well and you are a good person. Maybe life is good after all. Then read this book. A.B. Curtiss, author of Depression is a Choice:Winning the Battle Without Drugs."
5,Believe in your self!,"The best thing that you would know after reading this book is to believe in your self and to do things in ""your way"".You would also realise how important it is to know Golf in the corporate world."
2,Reads like a datebook,"This is a pretty disappointing book. A lot of names and dates put together which don't mean much - a lot of dry facts. It would have been much better if Welch had focused on a couple of challenges and discussed in detail the process he used to come up with a solution and how the solution was executed. Also, it would have been more fun if he had documented his rise in GE and how he achieved it rather than focusing the bulk of the book on his CEO days. Iacocca did this very well."
1,"Jack Welch, a great American hero? I don't think so.","Jack Welch made GE prosperous by laying off tens of thousands of American workers and transferring those jobs abroad for the sole purpose of exploitation of poor peoples and countries. His last year as CEO for GE, he earned over $200 million plus another $57 million in stock options. That is FOUR TIMES the COMBINED SALARY OF GE's 15,000 MEXICAN WORKERS. Who couldn't run a profitable company that way? Jack Welch is the kind of person that is killing our economy in the long run; by taking jobs away from American workers and by threatening our relations with other countries that GE, and many others just like it, have continuously, mercilessly exploited for cheap labor. The wages some of these workers receive makes their labor tantamount to slavery."
5,kayak,"The product is all right. The issue was regarding the payment.After i payed the fee of postage and the value of the parcell , when i pick it from the post i was pushed to pay another 21 pounds, without a previous warning. Is not about money is about principle. I think the entire prize must be shown along with the offer"
3,"good rings, but no quick release","Great solid scope rings, but these were not quick release. Using with a tikka t3 .308 with Carl Zeiss Conquest 3x9 1 inch scope."
1,Mislead by title,"Folks, I too was mislead by the title into believing that this CD was the soundtrack for Johon Boorman's ""EXCALIBUR."" The CD description did not contain much information. The music on this CD is actually European Techno Sound. Needless to say, I was very disappointed."
1,I wanted the movie soundtrack,"I must say I was so excited when i found this CD and bought it. Unfortunately it was a german techno band and not the music from the movie. So do not make the mistake I did.After some searching I did find the excalibur soundtrack by searching online. O'Fortuna by Carl Orff, the music by Wagner and Trevor Jones is much more uplifting and heroic to be sure!"
1,'Excalibur' (1981) by John Boorman this is not!,"I heard alot of complaints,and you have a right to be sore. Some people spend like [price[ on an album expecting to hear the 'Excalibur'(1981) movie sound track. Let me save you some disappointment and money,Carl Orff(German composer) wrote 'Carmina Burana-O Fortuna' and Richard Wagner(German composer) wrote 'Siegfried's Funeral March'(Twilight of the Gods-The Ring Cycle). These two songs were played in the movie soundtrack 'Excalibur'(1981) by John Boorman. I listen to a lot of classical German music,thats why I'm familar with these songs and composers.These two albums can be purchased at bargain basement prices ... each an album,it will greatly save you some disappointment and heartbreak."
3,"I was gonna write a bad review, but...","I was gonna write a bad review, but... Then I saw how trashed it already was. Music tastes vary dramaticly. I hate this, but I though if you like Vanessa-Mae, the musician who plays classics with an electric violin then you might enjoy this. My sister loves Vanessa-Mae, and low an behold she liked this white elephant gift. The CD might appeal to fans of the Movie ""Labrinth"". The CD consists of electronic/ new age reworkings of classical pieces. I perfer the pure unadulterated classics. Some don't...I suggest, Carl Orff's Opera ""Carmina Burana"" (has 'O Fortuna', note only this one track makes the ""Carmina Burana"" worthy of purchase.) I suggest as well, Prokofiev's ""Alexander Nevsky"" Soundtrack, for fans of 'O fortuna' and the Conan Soundtracks.Please Post where you can purchase the Limited Edition Excaliber.The Album's cheesy sound effects belong in a Seventies Greek Mythology Movie with Lou Farigno(?) A.K.A. The Hulk."
1,Terrible!!!!!,"This is probably the worst CD I've ever listened to. I finnaly found the website where you can buy a limited edition of the original soundtrack. You'll pay much more, but it beats this frisbee away!!!!"
2,"Not what I was hoping for, but have original copy now","This was not the soundtrack I was hoping for, but fortunately, I received a copy of the original soundtrack from a friend. The original is much better than this. This is one of my favorite movies and I always thought the score was excellent. The quaility of the original recording is great."
2,Nothing like the soundtrack,"I finally found the original soundtrack for Excalibur and this one is not it, it sounds nothing like it. But this CD is not all that bad, it's pretty good actually, if you're not expecting John Boorman's Excalibur soundtrack."
2,ok...but not the soundtrack.......,"allmost a goofy interpition of some classic tunes...the disc has merrit, however not the movie soundtrack i was hopeing for. pretty good to sleep to. even better for yardwork"
2,nice idea...POOR execution,"It's an impressive looking device, isn't it? Well, don't be fooled by that. I could say a lot of negative stuff about the usefulness of this item...but let me summarize it in one way: I have a KEYCHAIN 'solar light' (about 1 inch x 1 inch x 1/4 inch) that puts out more light than this (considerably larger) SC006 unit. The light on the SC006 is poor... whether it's via the crank, sunlight, or AA batteries. And, if you need it during a blackout, you'd better have memorized the location and positioning of the confusing 'array' of the slide switches on the unit because it will take a lot of trial and error to put them in the correct position while you're in the dark. For the same price $10(+$5 shipping), there are dozens and dozens of items you could get on Amazon that would put out 5-10 times more light. Ok, I'll say one nice thing about the SC006...at least the radio seems to work well. But for light in an emergency, look for something else."
4,A wild ride that never ends!,"You can't go into this story expecting everything to make sense. The situations that arise by happenstance are incredible; the characters' reactions to events pretty ridiculous. In this case however, it only serves to make the story more entertaining and hilarious. If you want a fast-paced book that grabs you and never lets go, all the while creating a unique setting and breaking the accepted norm of the genre, you won't be disappointed.Didn't like how moody the protagonist was, but he overall he was fairly agreeable. I also preferred the direction shown in The Eye of Icarus, from the followup series, though this one was decent, especially considering the price."
5,Loved It,"I loved this book. I found it interesting and relatable. The plot and the characters were strong and held my attention, start to finish! Can't wait to read his next book."
5,"Avid reader from Florence, SC","I thoroughly enjoyed Fractured Time. The characters were very interesting and the blend of humor, horror and adventure made the story quite a ride. It's good to see that science fiction is becoming fun again. I think the portrayal of female characters was very real in comparison to women in today's world. The friction between the men and women was both comical and challenging."
4,"You've seen the movie, now read the book","Though the book is not well known, the movie is. This book is the basis of the movie 'Doc Hollywood' starring Michael J. Fox. This is a novel of big city yankee doctor meets small town southern society and hilarity ensues. Shulman's humor is dry at times, but very warm. His best characters tend to be the small ones such as the mechanic and the mayor's daughter, but the entire book is just full of charm and humor. Highly recommended."
4,Great For Beginners,"I am a seasoned baker and find this book to be a decent book to have on the shelf, especially if one is new to baking. If you are not new to baking, some of the tips and suggestions are a little obvious.Healthy recipes for those whom are carefully watching their diet and details such as calories, protein, carbohydrate, total and saturated fat, colesterol and sodium are listed, for every recipe.The spiral bound book sits nicely on the counter, front and back covers clean easily and there are lots of fun, some healthy and traditional recipes and tips sprinkled throughout the pages in between.If your are a new or an experienced baker, you will find many MANY recipes for bar, drop, rolled, pressed, molded and refrigerator cookies are well written and easy to follow and there are many colorful photographs to see most of the finished recipes."
5,Cookies! Good Housekeeping Favorite Recipes (Favorite Good... Joanne Lamb Hayes,Highly recommend this Cookie Cook Book. I make a lot of cookies around Holiday time and this book had so many good recipes to choose from.
2,Not a great book,There are a number of books that depend on pictures to fill pages with the idea that bulk sells. A little more content would help.
2,Nothing new here,"There's something about Absurd Minds' music that just gets me the wrong way. The chord and key changes prevalent in most of their songs are bizarre and musically grating to my ears. The vocals are a typical brand of deep unmelodic drones, the synth sound is typical and predictable, there's really no melodies, and the lyrics sometimes don't make any sense, but I won't hold that last one against them. This is just so predictable and below average, and there's a lot of other bands out there today making much more intersting music. The song Lord is pretty good, probably my favorite on this album, but the rest of the album kinda floated past my ears, nothing ever really grabbed me or got me excited. I guess I'm just a fan of the more melodic stuff, this kind of music doesn't do a thing for me."
5,Saved My Skin!,"I would recommend this cleanser to anyone who has trouble with finding the right cleanser for their skin. I use it everyday, 2 x a day, and then I always put vitamin e oil on my skin afterward. It can be a little drying but is the best product I have ever found for cleansing my oily skin. When I use it I do not break out and my pores are smaller and my skin is really clean. I love it."
5,New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems,As a CPA who wants to understand stock trading systems and set up stock trading systems. I found this book to be one of the best I have ever read. I purchased a second book for my son to read as I hope he could learn to invest and trade in the stock market also. I did not want to give up my copy.
5,An investment classic,"New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, written in 1978 by Welles Wilder was- and still is- a landmark book in the field of Technical Analysis. The Relative Strength Index, (RSI) Average Directional Movement (ADX), The Parabolic Time/Price System and the Volatility System detailing the average true range concept (ATR) are a few of the foundational systems and indicators broadly used by charting services around the globe today.Lesser known gems such as the Reaction Trend System and the Swing Index System are detailed as well. Capital management techniques book-end these primary ""market concepts"" to give readers of all levels a solid basis to develop technical ideas- or use Wilder's as he plainly illustrated over 30 years ago. I would highly recommend this primer for beginners, as well as more advanced traders who value a mechanical and objective approach to market analysis."
4,Good if you want to go in details of ADX and RSI,"it will be useful if you want to go into details and step by step development of indicators developed by Wilder.However, the book does not add much to the experienced analysts."
4,New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems,"I have been purchasing books on trading for many years and recently it was suggested that I could find more detail on the RSI in Wilder's book so I purchased it. The book is dated - basically written before PCs were available for charting the indicator so much of the book goes through the manual calculation of ADX and RSI indicators which is fine. What is suprising is the lack of depth in setting the parameters which is understandable since all of the work in the book was manually calculated. Several ""system"" approaches are described but in modern terms I don't see them as very effective. Basically the book served the purpose of describing the indicators but in reflection the book is much to dated to recommend. You can find the same info on the Internet for free at some trader's website with some searching."
5,The Granddaddy of System Trading literature,"This is where it all started & many authors after this have adapted or re-worked the ideas presented here. This is a classic text, a must-have."
1,rip-off,"This expensive book has little to offer even for beginning technician, let alone those who are familiar with various oscillators already.It's very thin and has little to teach you. ...."
2,Over priced for what you actually get...,"There is nothing ""bronze finished"" about the base - it is black plastic and that is all.The top piece holding on the shade is also a lightweight black plastic.The ""glass"" shade goes 'thunk' when struck lightly with keys and so appears to be nice looking from a distance but up close - also made of plastic.I paid quite a lot of money for these two lamps and if contructed of metal and glass - the price would be right!As it is - I have two very expensive plastic lamps.REAL VALUE after seeing them up close is more like $75 TOPS!I over paid. Now its your move! I wouldn't buy from them again."
1,Apparent quality control problem,"Acer monitor I ordered arrived Dead on Arrival, with a bright-white dead pixel so visible right in the center of the monitor. How could a quality inspector have missed such an obvious defect? I'm returning it. This monitor also looks and feels cheap, compared to much more sophisticated design of Samsung monitors, which are only slightly more expensive. I'm going to stay away from Acer from now on."
5,Best Starter Book,"I looked at many many intro books, and this was the best one out there by far. Although a visual UNIX book sounds strange, the visual part means that the author provides examples of input at the command prompt. I am actually thankful to this author for writing this book. (BTW- the classic O'Reilly guide to sys admin would be a great book to get this one with: ISBN 0596003439)"
3,Watch out for mistakes,"There are a lot of mistakes in this book, some are typo, some are more serious especially in scripts, making it not a good reference. For people who are beyond novice/casual users, I'd not suggest this book. For beginners though, it's well organized and easy to digest."
2,Sloppiness,I can't believe they sent the wrong edition on a timely item like a college text! What more need be said.
1,Could have been very good...,"Unfortunately, a reasonably good plot was ruined by characters that are wishy-washy at best and scenarios that are just simply stupid. Without going to much into it, I'll never understand why the bad guy with gun pointed at good guy has to talk about how clever the good guy has been to get this far, but ultimately its all futile because I (the bad guy) am going to shoot you. But then good guy gets the opening to disarm/kill bad guy and win the day? Here's some advice to writers who want to have bad guy get the drop on good guy - shoot him, and shoot him again!Scenes like this, and Threshold is full of them, are stupid and only enjoyable when parodied in a film like Austin Powers II.If you're thinking about buying this book, stop there and go no further. This book is so bad that it doesn't deserve a rating, but I'm forced to give it at least one star."
2,Another plague thriller from the Crichton grist mill.,"Eh. Nothing new here. Combining parts Crichton and Cook, THRESHHOLD presents us with a standard plot and typically beautiful/brilliant characters who always seem to have just the right idea, or just the right thing in their pockets to get them out of a jam. Bolstered somewhat by a strong opening and fast-paced resolution. MOUNT DRAGON is a better novel, and that wasn't even all that good. Stick with ANDROMEDA STRAIN."
2,Not worth the effort,"I read this book, but I don't know why. After the first 15 pages or so, it turned into a derivative mishmash of Crichton, Cook, and Clancy. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot was transparent, and the dialogue was unbelievable."
5,A hard working geneticist in a deathly investigation.,"The book portrays a man (geneticist) that wants to help his heartbroken girlfriend. Unfortunately the investigations is tougher than expected. The man must overcome fears, death and other such elements. What a thriller"
5,A Gem,"I'm not a thriller buff, but I am now. The drama, intrigue, suspense, and unforgettable action packed into this book make it a real gem. Mezrich's female protagonist is rather one-dimensional, but hey, that's the genre. I recommend this book whole-heartedly."
3,02 sensors only for us!,"this product probly work as it should, but it DID NOT work on my Eu m3 as it said it would!"
1,Surely you jest!?,"""Best of Kraftwerk"", hah? Uh...yeah. So if this is a 'Best of Kraftwerk"" comp, where's ""Autobahn""? How about ""Pocket Calculator""? ""Numbers""? And what about those first three albums, hm? Ohhhhh..._I_ see...this is another one of those attempts by Capitol to cash in off of the three albums KW did there, which Capitol more or less ignored until later, when they were acclaimed as these important seminal works of techno and most anything electronic-driven and dance-oriented from the mid-80s on. You're best off getting the full albums, especially for the ""Radioactivity"" cuts, which are much better when heard in the context Messrs Hutter, Schneider, Bartos, and Flur intended them to be heard in. And someone at EMI/Capitol MegaConHugeCorp needs a boot to the head for this title, which borders on false advertising."
4,Evildead Annihilation of Civilization,This is a very good thrash album with many awesome riffs. The vocals are more on the hardcore side. What I mean by that is it reminds me of S.O.D. and not Iron Maiden. This should be a must have for thrash fans new or old.
5,This symphony speaks.,"This is a great CD; performance and sound alike are superb. If you have enjoyed Shostakovich (particularly his Fifth symphony), this is a CD that allows a deeper appreciation of his art. I pretty much agree with Mr. Dougal's comments, so what else to say? Buy it."
2,REALLY BAD FOR INTERMEDIATE C PROGRAMMERS!!!!!,"When I bought this book I thought it would teach the step from Intermediate C programming to Advanced. But it seems to just takeoff with unknown keywords, headers, and operators. This is a really bad book for Advanced C programming. I would recommend ""Teach yourself Advanced C in 21 days"". It's much better."
3,"Nice thread, but I don't see the difference","I bought this thread to sew cloth diapers because I had heard that its best to use 100% polyester thread to avoid wicking. Many diaper sewers online recommend Gutermann for the high quality over other brands. I do think this good quality thread, but I've yet to see why it is so much superior to other brands of 100% polyester all-purpose thread that are often a little cheaper. Anyway, the thread is good and I like the color."
5,"""ROCKIN""","JUST WATCHED THE MOVIE (JOHNNY WAS) WHICH I BELIEVED CAME OUT ABOUT 2006-2007 AND I HEARD THE SONG IN THE INTRO OF THE MOVIE....RISE UP, AND LOVED IT EVERSINCE..IT TOOK ME TWO DAYS LITERALLY TO FIND OUT WHO SANG IT. GHETTO PRIEST GOT THIS SONG OFFFF- RISE UP!!"
5,AMAZING,"I have been listening to Rusted Root for quite a while now, and somehow had never listened to this CD. I never knew what I was missing. This CD is great. It not only has a great version of Send Me On My Way, but the Cat Turned Blue is amazing. The song Won't Be Long is one of my personal RR favorites now. I would recommend this CD to any RR fan."
4,Rusted Root,"Cruel Sun has to be one of my favorite CDs in my entire collection, and deffinately one of Rusted Roots' best CDs (Next to When I Woke).I enjoy Rusted Root CDs because they are very real. They aren't beefed up with a bunch of high tech editing (Just listen to track 5). I've been to a Rusted Root Concert (Rock!), and other than a thousand screaming fans a very potent concert atmosphere, the songs sound just as pure on the CDs as they do in concert."
5,excellent,"the first time i heard rusted root was at a ""Jewel"" concert and i fell in live with the sound right away. I have never heard of them before up till now only because i was heavely into rap music. I've become versatile with my music. I have 2 cd's of dave matthews band. (love 'em)"
5,VERY HEART-WARMING,"I have never read Melody's books before and this one being my first was the perfect introduction to another world. Her writings are very descriptive, to the point where you actually feel like ""You are there"". This story will make you appreciate Christmas for what it's real intention is and will teach you how to have a real love for your neighbors.Her book actually moved me to the point where I ended up making a reservation in B & B in a community 3 hours away which will offer me similar settings as depicted in this story. I would have never even considered driving over a mountain pass alone in the dead of winter just to capture a feeling her story gave me. I'm glad I read her book and I am currently in the process of reading ""Angels In The Snow"". Another moving story.These are two books you can't put down."
5,What a pleasant surprise: Haydn which really *sparkles*!,"I heard a performance of one of the Haydn sonatas on our local classical station, and it was one of the very few performances of a Haydn keyboard work which caught and kept my attention. After the performance, the announcer stated that the performer was Jeno Jando.I looked up the name in Amazon, and found his recorded collection of the sonatas of Haydn. Out of curiosity, I ordered them -- and I'm very glad I did!I've heard a lot of Haydn in recitals, often played in a very mediocre way -- and I have to say Jando's Haydn recordings are a real surprise: we have Haydn which sparkles, lilts, has terrific sense of phrasing and a sense of movement which propels throughout each piece; is profoundly musical and impeccably played.I'm still listening to the CDs, and I have yet to listen to a performance I haven't absolutely loved. I really can't say enough good things about Jando's Haydn: I give it my strongest and most enthusiastic recommendation!"
2,Gun Crazed American Aesthetics,If you're a foreigner who has read about how Americans are gun crazed...and you want to see how they've actually absorbed this into their literary aesthetics...read it!Vulgarity is an integral part of contemporary American fiction...I'll stick with my Proust.
5,"""Love Sign"" is a great read!","I really enjoyed reading this book. ""Love Sign"" was one of my first love inspired books I ever read. This is a very sweet story about lady who is a writer who after getting jilted at the alter finds her true love when she decides to take off on a trip to forget it all and work on her book. She meets a sign maker and they fall in love. It's a very sweet story!"
3,"Okay ""Cherry Tripp"" i think you have a problem or something","Okay ""Cherry Tripp"" unless you 13 year old daughter is a midget then there is no way this would fit her! the biggest size is a 6x... and how the heck is this sluutty? ITS A TINKERBELLE OUTFIT!!!! I have looked at all your reviews and i know you are not a mom because you spell like every word you type wrong! so if you think what you are doing is funny i suggest you GET A LIFE!!!"
2,Fits small & not too fun!,"This runs super super small. My dd barely fit in it and she is a skinny 5 yr old. Fits like a Toddler sz 3/4 not for girl over 35 pounds. We were really disappointed with quality for the price. She was also mad that she could not dress herself in this cause she loves to do things independently now for dress up or fantasy play. It is like the cheapie Kmart type of custome quality. It has a velcro strip closure for the back of dress, waist is fitted and fabric cut in so not much give there. The Wings can be seperated from the outfit, they are also secured with vecro strip to the back of outfit so you could take them on and off easily. The velcro can snag the tulle skirt of the dress when taking on and off so be careful if you want this nice for pictures, take them right away :) this one gets low marks on quality, sizing, & ease of use (child won't be able to dress themselves in this for play)."
1,Depressing,This is a story about a musician who lost his daughter in an auto accident and later his common law wife leaves him. So he rides his motorcycle reminiscing how miserable this Canadian&#65533;s life has become. This is not about motorcycles but a book of how not to live your life. ...
1,Disappointed,"The loss is indeed tragic, and I have been more than your typical fan of both he and his band for over 23 years.I am finding it hard to complete this book, but I can't choose a reason. It could be that, as someone else said, each day that goes by is filled with what my days consist of, NOTHING.It could be that this is a page from Mapquest, repeated for 400+ pages.Neil had said years back, that people (fans) have no idea who he really is. And he is right, sadly. He has a problem with people who are not like him, and especially those people who have a weight problem.This has changed my view of him, even taking into account his losses.Rush fans, stay away."
3,peart,"Loved the first half of the book where he is doing more touring, second half started to get repetitve."
4,When it's cold outside read this,Too cold to go out on the bike ? Get comfortable and put another log on the fire and read this story. Very nice motorcycle journey and tale of personal growth and revelation. Recommended.
4,Window on how someone deals with death in their own fashion,"Read the book and enjoyed it.Was it self pity ? Not really. Had deaths to deal with and as Neil mentions there are specific stages you go through. Would loved to have done what he did but, got bills to pay. Such is his lot in life and such is mine. Not all of us have the luxury of being able to take a year off but, he earned it.Really like the description of the travelling, what he saw and did. Interesting the focus on the food from place to place. Was important to Neil for some reason.Made notes of the authors he mentioned and will be reading some of those ones. In that respect got even more out of the book than I expected.Would like to have seen a list of all the books he read. Where did he keep them all ? Must have just left some behind. Would have been a really good candidate for http://www.....com/I wish NEP well with his healing."
2,Ghost Rider,"I read Ghost Rider by Neal Peart. The First part of the book wasn't to bad, but when it got to the middle of the book it started to get real boring. This book has way to many letters in it that Neal wrote to his friend in jail. He should have called the book, letters to a friend in jail. I enjoyed reading about Neals rides and the different places he went, but I didn't need to read every single letter he wrote to his friend, it made for a very boring book. I'd give it 2 to 2 1/2 stars for the beginning of the book and then 1/2 a star after that. Neal should stick to music, he's much better at that.Long Way Round was a much better story of 2 motorcyclist who rode from England to New York and took the long way round to do it. That one I'd give 5 stars to."
4,Interesting,I feel awkward trying to describe a book about a personal tragedy. The book was very interesting and I found myself looking for every opportunity to pick it back up so I could keep reading. Neil Peart is a very articulate writer and makes a lot of accurate observations of the world and people he runs across on his journeys. Good dose of black humor throughout as well.
1,Cure for insomnia,"I am truly for for the loss that Neil endured, and wouldn't want for anyone to go through that. However the book is 460 pages of the most boring reading I have ever done. It's mostly letters to friends whom he would bore with his days adventures. Pretty repetitive since he wrote the same thing over and over and over..etc etc (you get the picture) to all his friends. Quite surprised his one friend Brutus didn't die from boredom in his jail cell. Neil should stick to what he is best at. Music!!"
2,Missed the opportunity,It starts out engaging. Driven to the road by deep personal loss. Then the anti-social whining begins. He misses the lesson to be learned and over looks the beauty and the people along the journey. I was so hoping for him to have a Revelation and not find solace in just hooking up again
2,Unremarkable,"I found this book rather repetitive. Mr Peart would get up early, ride hundreds of miles, meet a few unremarkable people along the way, have dinner, go to bed, get up early, ride hundred of...you get the drift.The personal tragedy suffered by Mr Peart that inspired or enforced his journey around the United States is something nobody should have to endure, and it was interesting to learn how he went about overcoming his grief. It just wasn't very entertaining or thought-provoking.In truth, if this wasn't written by one of my favourite musicians I very much doubt I would have got to the end."
4,Ghost Rider,Very well done. I'm now a fan of Pearts writing. He encompasses self introspection regarding the loss of his family with the travel log of an epic journey. Much more like Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance than MotoRaid. Both good books. Ghost Rider is definitely recommended.
3,"I devoured it, and now I am hungry again","I once was a huge Rush fan. But then went off to listen to other things, and Rush was on the back burner in an ""Oh yeah I remember liking that song"" kind of way.That being said, I always loved NPs beautifully crafted lyrics, and blew through his book about grieving for his family. It's an honest, yet guarded, account of how he grieved and got over his loss. He's obviously uncomfortable in the spotlight, yet needed to talk about this time of his life.I enjoyed it and am haunted by it after reading it. But now I want to know what happened next."
1,Sorry Neil...,"Here is another travel book I had high hopes for. I am sorry that Neil Peart lost his daughter & wife. However this tale is one big pity-party until the bitter end of the book. Sorry Neil, most of us can't just pick up and ride off into the sunset to get away from painful experiences in life. We have to tough it out. For any Rush fans, if you are expecting to learn much about Peart and the band, forget it. Rush is mainly mentioned in passing. You may be interested in knowing that Neil doesn't care much for touring and even less of his so-called fans these days. He also isn't too fond of fat people either! Those were the only revelations I came away with in the LONG boring book."
5,"Thanks, Neil","Great book. Fan or otherwise would do well to listen and hear what this guy has to say--rather than vilify his every move.Buy it. Or don't. Pressure your library to buy it and check it out! Either way, read it."
4,Far more than just an insight into Neil Peart's life...,"Just like many of the reviewers here at amazon.com had done, I purchased this book primarily because I am an avid Rush fan. It is true that Neil Peart has kept his private life very guarded from his fans and is very defensive about his privacy (see lyrics to ""Limelight"" by Peart). However...The more I read this book, the less I was aware that the man on this ""Healing Road"" is the drummer of a legendary Canadian progressive rock power trio. I became totally immersed in the mind of a man who is on an intense journey of personal re-discovery. Further to that, I became thoroughly engrossed with Peart's simple yet amazingly effective description of life on the road (on two wheels). Peart had made me forget ""who"" he was and instead made me want to read about who he is becoming -- a man in the wake of devastating tragedy, born of a fragile, healing ""baby soul.""My hat's off to Peart. This book is an excellent read."
4,"nicely written travelog, and dealing with personal recovery","Be advised that this book is a journal documenting one person's travels. It only occasionally mentions Rush and the rock and roll lifestyle. Those who are looking for a ""Behind the Music"" type of book will be disappointed.With that out of the way, this book is well written and easy to follow. With his detailed description of the landscape, people, and places, I felt as I was on each and every mile of his trip. From the beginning of his desperate state, to his recovery, the journey in between is both dangerous yet breathtaking. Most people don't experience this type of adventure in their lifetimes. Neil Peart had to encounter this in order to survive. Here's to his ""little baby soul"", and thanks for taking the reader with you on your journey."
5,Ghost Rider : Travels on the healing road,"I have followed Rush and been a fan since 1976. I was 12 years old when I first became amazed at the talent of Neil Peart. Recently I was watching the DVD for Rush in RIO when I discovered that Neil had been through some real life challenges . As a fan I feel I have shared a journey through their music , as the years have passed I have grown up with Rush being a soundtrack from my youth. It is with that in mind that I purchased Neils book. All I can say is that my heart broke with the reading of the first chapter. Neil lost his daughter and within a few months later lost his wife. Feeling alone and with no recourse but to keep moving he took off on what this book shows as a life adventure to find himself and to deal with the loss of his love ones. Neil shares his journeys with you in this book as his heart unfolds. I was deeply touched as well as amazed with his extreme talent. This is a must read for any fan!"
3,One of the funniest books ever,"I need a Healing Road of my own after reading this thing. Ach. If you hate fat people, ugly people, Americans, Rush fans, and ordinary people, really, this book is for you. Ach. Peart is a narcissist, a talented but foul man who is stuck in Doestoyevski's prison of loving humankind but hating almost everyone he meets. For someone so private and so allegedly intelligent I have no idea if he realizes the depth of his reveal he plunged with this thing. His first attempt at a relationship with Dave Foley's cast-offs is a pretty awesome and horrifying read. Ach. Throughout Peart's pondering on his fame, he admits that he worked very very hard to get to be one of the best drummers ever but insists he's ""just a guy"". And he shows that with every reveal. Talent and ""fine human being"" are not dependent. Ach. Neil is a jerk."
4,Neils tragedy and triumph,"Good read, heartbreaking 1st couple of chapters that kicks off the book. Middle chapters bog down a little as lengthly desciptions of desert landscape becomes monotonous. Last sevral chapters are excellent as he emerges from the pain and finds a new life, new love, and re-discovers music."
4,Nursing his 'wet baby soul',"The best description of this book is one I saw in a review or blurb I saw a few years ago, which compared Peart's motorcycle journey through North America after the loss of his wife and daughter to Teddy Roosevelt's trip West - ""Black care,"" Roosevelt wrote, ""rarely sites behind a rider whose pace is fast enough"" - after the simultaneous death of his wife and of his mother. Peart, probably the greatest drummer who ever lived, wrote the books as a series of journals as he attempted to make sense of a life and career that collapsed in the span of 18 months. He rode from Montreal to Alaska, down and through the Southwest and then across into Mexico and into Belize - something like 50,000 miles in less than two years, nursing his `wet baby soul' back to health. I've always been a fan of the album that came from this period (he eventually rejoined Rush who had disbanded in the wake of the tragedy) since I heard it in high school."
2,Good - but undeveloped.,The story is tragic but the main character seems arrogant and undeveloped as he passes through his grieving. His life on the road seems monotonous after the first escapades. Perhaps it is the monotony that helps him.
2,Waste of Time to Read...Unless you love getting depressed!,"What an self-indulgent piece of junk. As a previous reviewer said, no direction, just blather and self-pity. If he thinks he has it rough, try holding a job while going through this! THAT'S the real world, Neil. To pay twenty bucks to indulge his self-pity makes it quite a swindle. RUSH fans, don't waste your time. You'd hardly know his life as a musician by reading this book. And let's not elaborate on his boring letters to ""Brutus"". Absolute filler to thicken the book. However, if you love self indugent misery, this is your book!Whiney, uninspirational.....boo hoo! boo hoo! Fire the editor!"
2,disappointing,"the prose is deeply purple.author claims repeatedly to be living in a state of ""self-imposed exile"" except that he keeps visiting friends and family and writing letters.despite the author's surviving what represents perhaps the most horrible experience a man can endure, the book reveals little to us about grief or recovery. if the motorcycle trip itself is going to be without destination, shouldn't the author take us someplace unambiguous?we're never under any kind of obligation to find a narrator likeable or sympathetic, but there really isnt even an attempt made here.in the end it seems Peart has overcome his bitterness, but we don't get to see it happen, save for an abrupt revelation that he has remarried- about a paragraphs worth.Peart seems to concentrate on his writing style and color, but in this work seems to lack the imagination for telling a story that is hinted at in his lyric writing. plenty of anecdotes but little in the way of wisdom."
2,No,"Boring, he repeats the same thing once and again, some photography does not hurt, the beginning was good and so, but later, oh man, no thanks, i will leave it there."
1,"Wealthy, selfcenterd, motorcycle yuppie.","I dont read much, usually cause I'm ridin, but I heard alot about this Ghostrider book, so I took a gander. Well, asin I'm a poor folk, I have to make due with my rations, leavin me quite inventious on the road. This here Neilson guy is a bit outta touch with what I call the soul of motorized cycling. He swipes a credit card, I count out some change, he wrecks and flys home to safty, I find some work for a bit, do some mechanican and eventually move on.As far as ridin out yer lonelyness and speedin away from a past you'd just soon forget, well, there aint enough road to cary me to safe distance. I thought maybe, from what I heard, this fellow wrote a book about folks a little bit like myself. Well, his fairy tale is just that. Ifin you wanna read about some pompous, richy rich, softy, that wont teach you a thing bout touring without a pocket full of credit cards, shoot, THIS BOOK IS THE TICKET. Otherwise, it'll make for some easy firestartin nights. Amen."
4,"Not a groupie, but enjoyable reading",I'm not a Rush groupie and actually read this book on my huband's recommendation. Neil Peart earned my admiration for his intelligent mind and entertaining writing style. This would be a nice read for anyone who has a decent education as he does not write down to his readers as some do.
5,"I bought this for my husband, a bass player. He said it was awsome, & he reads ALOT! Thanks Amazon.com",My husband loved the book. He is a bass player in a band & has followed the careers of several musicians. He found this book to be awsome and it also told him things he didn't know. I did good! Thanks Amazon.com!
3,Written for Neil and Neil only,"Very, very,touching at moments, impales his sadness on you, but take it for what it is, a stolen diary of a man's comeback from oblivion. I really felt his loss, but the sense that he did not request nor need nor apreciate,my simpaty made me feel detached from the story, like i was reading something never intended for me, but to be kept under a bed somewhere by the author. Either way artists are always crazy, and i feel happy for him and for his reconstructed soul."
3,Definitely worth a read if you're a fan of RUSH.,"Short version.... Not a bad book. Writing could have been better and at times the repetitive nature of the journey can sort of bore you. I also think that Neil held back quite a bit on a lot of his thoughts and feelings. Enough managed to make it to paper to help understand the man during a tough time.As for you folk who found out Neil feels uncomfortable when fans approach him.... Go somewhere else to find a friend. I appreciate the music and although a stronger connection to the fans would have been nice to see, who really cares.There are also a few lines referencing Geddy and Alex. Overall, I'm quite glad I read this."
4,"Good, clear recording","Naxos has once again continued its tradition of producing good performances, clearly recorded, at bargain prices.This recording is very good (although I admit I'm no expert on the work), and the digital recording is great - I could clearly hear the enunciation of each word. The CD notes include the full text, also.I gave it four stars only because I thought I could hear a little bit of an echo, perhaps from the place it was recorded. However, it could have been the speakers I was using at the time, which aren't my best. Without that echo, I'd give it five stars.At the Naxos price, this very good recording is a great buy - definately recommended!"
3,Frustrating,"Ladislav Slovak is a fine conductor, and on the surface this CD has a lot going for it. The performance of the Fifth is beautifully etched, with especially vivid outer movements. The tempo for the last movement is slow and excellently sustained through the coda, a very distinctive take on this movement. The problem is with the sound. It is rather opaque, with a limited dynamic range. At times in the slow movement it is hard to tell exactly what is going on. The sound in the Ninth, from a year later, is better defined, but with unusually forward strings that emphasize the raspiness of their Slavonic sound. The performance is witty and pointed, with especially fine playing by the solo oboe. In sum, this would not be a prime recommendation for the Fifth, but if you can tolerate the sound it makes for interesting comparisons."
1,How Sad Indeed,"This book is really a testimony to all those that suffer from MPD/DID are up against. Self involved doctors such as this writer, who was more interested in her ""maleness"" to help her in any way at all. He directed his ENTIRE therapeutic experience with her around masculinity. She had a couple of male alters, but many more female ones. He effectively threw this poor woman to the curb and benefited financially from her. At the end of his book he seemed to think from his last interview with her that he had helped her some... then she returned to the in-patient ward after the interview... JEEEZ! Then he notes others came to try to help her after him. Sounds like this writer was just another exploiter in this woman's life. I hope she has found real help. This writer makes me incredibly sick. Shame on him!"
3,Nice resource of basic information,This was the first book I ever purchased online ... a number of years ago:-)The book gives all the basic information required to start writing articles for magazines and also putting together a book proposal for a nonfiction book. My only criticism is that more information could have been included on the actual writing process.
1,"No, no , and no","I found these to be horrible. Air pockets everywhere, even after applying via the instructions. (I used to apply vinyl graphics to glass in my career, so I know how to do this stuff...) and this was just awful. It also made it very hard to see the graphics, even in the spots without air pockets. The material is just strange.Ended up not using it at all. Good luck if you decide to try it."
4,EPL -A Decade Of Great Goals And Matches,This is a great item to remember the first decade of the English Premier League.It has 2 dvd's put into 1 that show us all the great goals and the top 18 matches of the first decade of electrifying action.I don't have any critisim of the great goals disk but the great matches could have had more action instead of just the goals.If they couldn't make this dvd longer than maybe they could get rid of some of the talking.I agree with the greatest goal by David Beckham and the greatest match of the decade contested between Newcastle and Liverpool.Bechamas chip from half way was awsome and Newcastle vs. Liverpool was the most exciting match i've ever seen because there was alot on the line and it had great action and great goals.There should have been more than 2 Chelsea matches seem I am a Chelsea fan. If you are a true soccer fan buy this DVD now!!GO CHELSEA!!!!! WE ARE GOING TO WIN IT THIS YEAR
5,Holding on to Hope: A pathway through Suffering to the Heart of God,"I so enjoyed this book, I loved how the story was presented and I would definitely recommend this book as a wonderful book for anyone who is going through any trials in their life. Gives a really great way to deal with many circumstances in life that we don't realize we deal with on a daily basis."
5,No equal,This book has remained opened on my desk for the past 15 years of practice. I still consult it several times a week. Please re-print it!
2,Poor quality on this VHS tape,"The story line is wonderful, unfortunately, the audio was awful! You could barely here Liam when he spoke - it was very hard to understand any of the dialog. Perhaps it was the age of the tape, but we have others that old and had no problem with the audio."
3,Used for study group,Most likely a book I would not buy except for the use in study group. Book was ok and afairly good compliment to John.
5,What a perfectly titled commentary,"I lead a small house church and was looking for something that I could use to take our group through the book of John. I found Wright's writing engaging, and I will now use his other ""everyday"" commentaries as well."
2,a non-staggering work of boredom,"Not since Zadie Smith's ""White Teeth"" have I so missed what all the hype was about. Because I have enjoyed Mr. Franzen's writing thoroughly in the past I was SO looking forward to this release, that is until I read the first few chapters, and then I was SO looking forward to the end. Yet another book about a dysfunctional family so chockful of cliches it was painful to finish. The three adult children in this family (and in particular the eldest son's awful wife) make the Manson family seem nice."
2,A long winded let down,The book had a great premise...the American dysfunctional family but it rarely talked of dysfunction in the family context. It consisted mostly of individual failures. There was absolutely no humor. It was verbose and at times difficult to follow (the correcktall convention comes to mind). It also seemed that the book could have have been much much shorter...why was there such an in-depth discussion of Lithuania or the daughter's lesbian experiences? What about Enid's friend on the cruise...did we really need all that background? It was a chore to read and I'm very glad that it is all over now. I doubt I will attempt to read anything by this author again. A fool and his money are soon parted I suppose (and I know better than to trust hype!!!)
3,"It's What I Like to Call ""Dick Lit""","Franzen is like the kid brother of the Dick Lit crew: he's just as much of a dick but way less fun. I know Franzen wants to be entertaining. I also know he doesn't want his novels defined by ""dysfunctional family."" But you can't always get what you want, Jonathan! (This isn't to say this isn't a well written novel, just so you know.)(Read full-length reviews on my blog: [...])"
1,Snoozefest,"The Emporer has no clothers..This overhyped behemoth of a novel was supposed to resuscitate the flagging interest in American literature...clunky prose...tiresome dialogue...and a wearying plot to slog through make this novel the Deathblow to American letters...where is our generation going to find an inspired genius and madman like Selby, Robert Stone, Burroughs, or [...] i'll even take Kerouac??...the fact that this book makes the Oprah Book Club speaks volumes...[....]I am looking for some crazy [...guy] like a Coleridge who is going to change my world...like good old KNut Hamsun to carry me off into pastoral realms where language and human passion meet in characters who are REAL..and not pasteboard cutout types of a Middle American family whose pain was about as real to me, as the Brady Bunch episode where Tiger knocks down the house of cards...Give me Inspired Literature or Give me Death!!"
5,A Middle America Microcosm,"What more can be said about one of the most talked about Oprah choices (even if it didn't remain such for long)? The bare bones of this story sound very boring - retired Alfred and his wife Enid live in the American Mid-West - he is fading into Parkinson's disease, she is trying to ignore this fact. Their three grown children have moved East, trying to escape their boring middle American lives and now read as a catalogue of the dysfunctional aspects of modern American lives. Pretty ho-hum.But this is definitely not a boring book - it is a funny, fascinating and clever story with seriously flawed, seriously real characters. This book is absorbing from the beginning. Franzen jumps back and forth through time easily, explaining why people have ended up how they are. Never has Middle America seemed such a fascinating microcosm of human existence."
3,I Can't Decide,"Firstly, I have to give the upmost respect and credit where credit is due; this man can write! There is no doubt about that. The author is incredibly talented and this book is brilliantly written.Okay, the problem I found was that I almost hated this family, I mean really. God, sometimes I found them so pathetic it made me want to graon outloud. The mother is nagging and nieve and over bearing, the sister is narcasitic, the younger brother is a self obsessed and somewhat creepy guy and the older brother is pompous and pathetic at the same time, oh yeah and the father, well didn't much like him either.The family is so [messed] up its staggering, maybe thats the point, I don't know. They never resolve anything, and they never become more likeable, maybe that makes them more real, I don't know.I just can't decide how I feel about it really"
3,The Corrections could have used some,"Beginning with high hopes for the book, I was not disappointed early on in the story. The author has a great imagination for pointedly descriptive phrases, and his similes bordering on metaphysical conceits sometimes hit the mark in a way that made me smile. Wanting to go on, I read with hunger to find out more about the characters and the hinted plot twists to come. The spell began to slowly wear off about halfway through the book, as the skill with words overcame the plot believability and character development. I think the author probably got tired of his characters about the same time I did. I finished the book , but by the end it felt like a chore that needed to be done."
2,this book aint all its advertised to be.,My wife ordered this book because of all the hype around it about pulitzer and media praise however when she started reading it she said the beginning is some guy talking about masturbation and other crap. She is really disappointed with it and I told not to just buy books based on media hype but to look for real people reviews on amazon first and if there were none to wait for someone else to read it first.
1,Boring!,"This was possibly the most tedious and depressing book that I have ever read. I didn't want to finish it, but kept thinking that maybe it would get better (it didn't). The characters are all sad and annoying and you don't really feel sorry for them as much as you would like to slap them into reality. Don't be fooled by reviews you've read in magazines, I was, and this book is only readable if you enjoy torturing yourself."
1,Too bad I can't go lower..,"I suppose that I have to give the author credit for well developed characters, even if they are self-centered, self-obsessed, petty individuals that inspire nothing but contempt. On a long weekend I was stuck with this book as my only read, at 3/4's through I found a good use for the book. I used it as target practice. If these type of people populate the author's life, I feel sorry for him."
1,painfully hard to read,"I hated this book. It was completely manic and and full of characters that you just wanted to smack over the head until they snapped out of their self-involved lives. Perhaps there was some redeeming quality that I would have found in the end, but after forcing myself to get through the first 350 pages, I did myself a favor and shelved it."
1,I Don't Think So,"This book did not hold my attention for too long. He expounded on topics that he didn't need to and didn't expound enough on topics that actually interested me. He attacked family values just as hard as he could, and provided no resolution to anything. Sometimes as American people, we confuse reality with negative ideals. Right, there is no perfect family, but glamourizing adultery, tyranny in marriages, no respect for children or parents, just contributes to the confusion and disarray that corrupts today's family. We should make a conscious effort, as writers, to work towards rebuilding a positive foundation. With more people reading than ever before, we have to be careful about the messages we are sending across. I hold no ill will towards Jonathan Franzen, just what he wrote.GOD BLESS,Tamara Ward"
1,Lots of Correction Needed....,Painfully slow narrative exacerbated by the dispicable characters. I forced myself to finish it in hopes that the characters were met with unfortunate ends.
2,Po Mo Pop,"Franzen's novel is heart-breaking. He should be commended for taking such a risk in our hip, Po Mo age. The Corrections is, at once, a rejection of postmodernism's sarcastic irony (a rejection of emotionless fiction) and, ironically, an attempted rejection of Pop fiction. Pop fiction and sentimentality are, by many accounts, inextricably intertwined, and Franzen (again, commendably) attempts to walk this fine line between the unwanted label of Pop Fictionist (hence, the famed Oprah dismissal) and a resuscitation of emotion in literature. Much of the book, however, is written like a ch(tongue)eek homage to Pop fiction, thereby solidifying Pop fiction's exclusive claim to emotion in literature. His novel, it's apparent purpose, unfortunately, defeats itself."
2,Not a novel at all,"Franzen has an amazing ability to write a (sometimes endless) scene. The scenes he writes, though, have nothing to do with each other. The parents, who presumably are central to the book -- since this is, after all, a book about a family -- are stick figured stereotypes who offer no more of a clue as to why they have spawned a dysfunctional family than that they are generically weak and flawed people. Nor is there anything about the parents that seems to directly relate to why their children have the flaws they have. All you really have learned by the end of several hundred pages is that (1) the parents are screwed up; and (2) the kids are screwed up. Not exactly a revelation. The book utterly lacks emotional intelligence or depth, which are absolutely necessary for this book to work. Franzen clearly has the talent to write any scene he wants to write; someday hopefully he will figure out how to use that talent to write a novel."
1,Disappointing,"A rich, thick indulgence into the lives of some quite boring people. Not much happens, and when it does, it's boring. I was truly disappointed. The best writing occurs in the first chapter, in a bit about a certain word that appears too frequently in the protagonist's own manuscript, and where he notes each of the word's frequent appearances. Hilarious. Other than that, totally, utterly, not worth reading. If you want to read a lengthy, indulgent, luscious novel, try Swimming in the Volcano by Bob Shacochas (sp?)."
1,over the over the top,"An interesting story, if one looks beyond Mr. Franzen's bloated self-importance. Everything in this book was too inflated, too ridiculous, too beyond belief even for the parody that it was."
1,Correcting the Hype!,"I'm only into 60-something pages and I hate this book! I don't know if I'll be able to finish it. I hate the characters, I hate their lives and the writing isn't inspired enough to make me want to continue reading. I'm with all those other people out there who have gone against the hype to say, ""What's the big deal?"""
3,Oh My!,"This book started out rather well, somewhat fast-paced; but by the time I was reading about poor Albert's hallucination of feces chasing him, I began to doubt my choice. A few chapters later a whole new character was introduced and I was sooo tired of the long ""back and forth"" scenes, I threw my hands up in surrender. I did skip ahead a bit to discover that poor Albert had fallen off the cruise ship...give me a break! I made the right choice."
