1,A complete waste of time,"The book's premise, while interesting, failed to come to fruition. There were too many contradictions, too many characters and subplots that were introduced and then never seemed to go anywhere; they disappeared or were simply explained away by some glib twist. The ending was incredibly pat...sort of in the order of, ""Wow, how amazing. The situation is magically resolved, and Beck is once again a hero."" The writing style was sophomoric, the dialogue stilted, and the structure disorganized. I found it to be an unsatisfying waster of time."
1,What a sleeper!,I am a medical thriller fiend. This is the worst book I've ever read. What a complete waste of time and money. Very poor writing. Not an attention grabber by any stretch of the imagination.
4,comprehensive collection,Another book for those interested in European language policy. This is a valuable ressource on Central and Eastern Europe (in most other books the emphasis is on Western Europe). The quality of the essays varies but most are quite good. Of particular interest is Seidlhofer's essay about the role of the native speaker in FLL.
5,Throw the prilosec away,"I've been using this product for 6 months. It's great works better than prilosec. It's much cheaper,taste great. Delivery was fast(3 days during the holiday rush) I've suffered from GRED my whole life buy this product!"
5,worked wonders,"I tried DGL on the advice of my gastroenterologist because of severe reflux. None of the prescription meds were taking care of it. But this stuff did the trick. I take one after a heavy meal and 2 at bedtime. Finally, some relief. Just make sure you get the german chocolate flavor, and not the natural."
3,Not sure if it's working,"I agree with some of the other reviews that I can't tell if it's really working or not. I have major bowel issues and wanted to get off fiber, psyllium and all that stuff, so started using it at first with 47 pistashios, Dr. Andrew Weil's cure for all stomach ailments. I ended up with the runs that were awful! So now I am still using what I have along with Organic Papaya Juice that I also buy at Amazon.com because it is impossible to find in the stores. Not even Whole Foods carries pure papaya juice. Papaya juice is well known for digestive issues and according to Dr. Oz, speeds up the rate of digestion which is my problem. It seems to be working but I am not sure if it just the juice."
1,Chocolate Version Ineffective,"I've used both the normal Enzymatic Therapy DGL, and this German Chocolate.No comparison, this stuff does not work. The regular flavor does."
1,contains milk (not dairy free),"I was interested in this product but I can't consume dairy so I'm always wary when a product is chocolate flavored. (The description here on Amazon states that it does not contain dairy.) I went to the company's website and in the ""Notes"" section of the description for this product was this - **Based on 2000 calorie diet.Other Ingredients: fructose, inulin, natural flavors (coconut and milk), cocoa bean powder, silicon dioxide, and organic guar gum.Too bad - I would have liked a good-tasting DGL tablet!"
4,Excellent when I overeat,"The directions for this product say to take it before you eat, but I find it helps my stomach settle when I eat more than usual and I am bloated. Like at holiday time when I eat foods that I don't usually eat, or MORE food than I usually eat! The German chocolate is delicious."
1,Be Careful,"De. Andrew Weill touted this product As a wonderful healing agent for the stomach. However, I got a stomach ache both times I tried it. And it was a bad stomach pain. The first time it happened, I thought it could be something else. When it happened again, I decided not to continue using it.So I shall stick with Inulin FOS and ALIGN to help my stomach.I was disappointed."
3,Taste is OK,I was hopeful the product would help me cut down on a couple of the prescriptions I have to take for GERD and acid reflux. I didn't notice any difference when taking the product or not. Dr Oz recommended it. I shouldn't have wasted my money
2,El Cazador de la Bruja,"This product is sooo boring that I quit it at the end of the first volume and just put it away ,leaving another thing for my hiers to dispose of. There is really nothing new,different,exciting...anything that would recommend one waste a moment watching it. The character designs are about average at best and even if they ran around bare bean and buck naked (there is zero fan service)there would have to be SOMETHING else catch and hold one's attention. There simply is nothing to recommend this product to those not semicomatose and tied to a chair with their eyes glued open."
3,Ace #5 is good but not great,Having purchased the first 4 collections in the excellent Teen Crush series I was anticipating the same wonderful mix of voices and styles from this roots of rock and roll anthology. The repro quality and terrific liner notes have made me a big ACE Records fan. Unfortunately #5 does not have that spark and creativity the others do. Too many male vocals that all blend together. Need some female leads along with a few girl groups would have made this offering as great as the others in the series. A little Mary Robbins would spice it up too. A good but not great collection of hard to find one hit wonders. I'm ready for number 6!
1,Waste of time and money.,"In this book you will learn what you should do but precious little about how to do it. I took two things away from this book. One, you should use good description. And two, use a journal to write down your sensory observations. The rest of the book's content range from the superficial to the obvious to the questionable. This is the first writing book I've read that extolled the virtues of using adverbs as a writing tool. This from a book on description.Any writers out there looking for a good book on creating the words for good fiction should look to Monica Wood's ""Description"". It's one of the best books on writing, period, that I have yet read. 5 stars for that one."
2,Sloppy thought mars this effort,"The other volumes in this series have all been excellent, but careless editing and some wooden writing weaken this book's advice. Spelling errors (Wurthering Heights, racquet for racket) and weak prose (Rozelle likes to split infinitives with adverbs) weaken credibility, and some of the advice is questionable. Rozelle favors using adverbs to clarify prose instead of finding strong verbs and specific nouns. He also tends to use older books for examples, many at least 15-20 years old. This is especially true when he discusses genre fiction in superficial terms. Some of the book is irrelevant, too, discussing characterization without relating it to setting or description. I'd suggest Monica Wood's book on Description instead of this one."
5,Description & Settomg,"Description & Setting: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting a Believable World of People, Places, and Events (Write Great Fiction)Superb writing, and I finally got a cogent explanation of ""voice."""
1,This one goes to the trash can ...,"Sorry. I hate to pile on, but I must agree with Lit Teacher on this one. The thinking was sloppy and contradictory, and the writing was wooden, stiff, irritating. I bought it a few months back and hid it in a drawer until I could get around to it. I pulled it out today with a smile and high hopes.Boy was I disappointed. I thought maybe I was having a bad day. Maybe my concentration was off. So I pulled out Truman Capote. Smooth as silk. So it wasn't my fault. It was Ron's. I finally decided to scan the book, and that revealed there was really nothing new here, nothing interesting.I wish I had not wasted the money. I must be more careful. But, as for this book, there is nothing I need to refer to later, so I'm putting it in the trash. It is Saturday evening. They will come on Monday to take it and the other garbage away.Roger"
1,Very disappointed,"I recently purchased this item for my daughter who has been wanting to paint. I thought this would be great because the paint is in the brush and it won't be messy. Although all this is true, both of us found it very frustrating that it was difficult to get out of the tube. If this is made for children, shouldn't it be easier to use and should an adult really have trouble with it?"
2,Self-serving dribble !,"What a disappointment ! This book goes to show that sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. The glitzy, superficial cover accurately warns of the trifling and shallow literary contents awaiting the reader. Ms. Starr would do well to gather her family's 100 + years worth of photographs and compile a coffee table book on the history of Artkraft Strauss rather than pretend she can write."
4,Latina Fever!,Beautiful blend of latin and house beats!This compilation is guaranteed to keep you moving.
1,"Sony produces a ""Klunker""","This is the worst Sony has produced in their Digital Camera Line. I love Sony stuff! I am on my 3rd SONY Digital camera, they all STILL work perfectly, giving high quality images. The HVL-RLA does not provide enough light for even a marginal exposure. The pictures you get are full of ""noise"" and it ""gobbles"" batteries in about 20 mins time. The unit is engineered well and I do like that aspect but if it does not illuminate the subject well enough to record a nice image, it's worthless. Sadly, I returned mine to Amazon for a refund."
3,Well Written But Slow,"This collection of stories was my introduction to Alice Munro. The stories are well written but, tedious at times. I read this book for a book discussion and there is lots to discuss. I didn't look forward to reading this book after work. The interesting thing is that the more I think about the stories, the more I appreciate them. Except for one of the stories, the plots are really different and Munro is able to tell a person's life in a short amount of time. I recommend this book with reservations."
1,Not All That Good,"I found myself skipping pages in this book because the characters inspired no loyalty, love nor sympathy in me.I found the whole book to be painfully vague and ill-written.I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,Typical Brilliance,"These stories are subtle and lush and refract immense light. There is no relationship, especially any regarding women, that is not examined with great care and great insight. Alice Munro is one of the best at capturing women and the ties that bind us together, and sometimes these ties are subtle, and I love how artfully she manages this over the course of this collection. Make sure that you read the stories in order so you can absorb the connections back to previous people and events. ""Runaway"" may very well be as strong as ""Friend of My Youth."" This and Jennifer Paddock's brilliant novel-in-stories ""A Secret Word"" are easily the best books I've read this year. Easily."
4,Pleasant reading...,"I've never read Munro before, and purchased this one after seeing a rave review of ""Runaway"".I have only read two or three of the short pieces so far, and find Munro to be a pleasant read, allowing me to do some easy pass-timing."
3,Mars and Venus,"Alice Munro is unsurpassed as a wordsmith. Her language is precise, her storytelling exacting, her style lyrical. I consider her among the ranks of Annie Proulx and Arundhati Roy as a great contemporary female talent.But her Runaway stories are so small and quiet that I find myself struggling to concentrate. They are beautifully told tales, but none too engaging.And I cannot help but notice the seeming gender gap between ratings on this site.I give her a 5 for style, but believe me, this record you can't dance to."
1,Obsolete- only covers up to 7.0,"Don't expect this to help much if you are planning to use the current version 8.1, as things have changed a great deal from 7.0 (and SP3 about to be released changes the content mgmt functions entirely)."
2,This book is pretty bad,"This book is pretty horrible, but since it is the only one out there dedicated to weblogic portal I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1.Things wrong:This book isn't organized well at allNumerous errors that should have easily been caught (screen shots that are the same, things that say: create this domain named ""1"" now start domain ""6""... and you are like, wtf?)Too many screenshots (I'd say about half the book is screen shots)Just plain bad. Things that really make me mad are things like this: In the best practices section they state that you should always use the WL taglibs (obviously), and thats all it says. In other words, they tell you to do something that is very important but don't give you any more info about it or even provide a url to a weblogic website on taglibs.Only get this book if you are tired of staring at docs on your monitor."
1,Self aggrandizement at its worst,"Mr. Block continues his series of poorly written books with his latest addition on BEA.The wording was poor and the overall organization of this book made me contemplate the inner workings of the chaotic mind that came up with this book. It is difficult to follow any theme that might have been intended in this book. Thankfully Block brought on some more collaborators to help the book along and perhaps it is the collaborative effort that makes this book less attrocious than Block's normal fare....Fortunately this won't get the traction he might have received from his Silverstream book because this one actually has competition. Don't believe the reviews written on the SAME DAY. They are obviously fake, probably written by someone very close to Mr. Block."
1,Stick with online documentation,"This book is very light on explanation, unless you need explanation on filling in blanks."
1,Piece Of Costly Crap!,Totally Useless. I will return this book in Borders within less than 12 hours of buying. Positively. Wonder why it took three authors to write this crap. Half an author is more than enough.
1,Useless for 8.1,There is no way to use this book if your using workshop 8.1 and build a portaling applications. NOTHING APPLIES. Do not buy this book!!!
1,Save your money,"I found nothing in the book that I can't get for free from BEAs e-docs and I find the e-docs to be very well written. Plenty of screenshots with examples that exactly mimic the tutorials already provided by BEA. Needless to say, I was disappointed with the book."
2,I should not have bought this untested,"My 16-ounce Stanley Anti-Vibe hammer is my all-day tool, but needing a slightly larger framing hammer, I bought this one and was immediately disappointed. It's poorly balanced, has a rounded head, and took a beating after only one day's use. Like most companies, Stanley does a lot of things well, but this was not one of them. I opted for theDead On DOS22S 22-Ounce 18-Inch Steel Smooth Face Hammerwhich has been my joy. Otherwise, I recommend the titanium Stiletto hammers if you're working with them all day."
5,Fast-Paced Thriller!,"This is a very fast-paced thriller like the others in the Dolly series. Johnson is here in all his glory, and this time the Bird is a real smart cookie - one who likes to cook believe it or not. This book has everything - sex, stolen jewels, spys, murder and lots of action. Sarah is the bird in this story, and she's a really likeable dame. Her mother and dead father provide the quirkiness. Her brother is the plodder, and her friends show the fast life that money pays for in the beautiful Spanish town of Ibiza. Sarah finds she is involved with three young men and is in the enviable position of having to choose, but unfortunately the choices are really made for her in a well-orchestrated denouement engineered by the enigmatic Johnson. Read this series. It's great fun."
1,The P Word,"Why doesn't any one else say it? ""The L Word"" has nothing to do with gay liberation or feminism. It's pornography pure and simple, a commercial attempt to main-stream porn by making it look PC. The plot is meaningless, the dialogue ridiculous. The whole point of the series is to show nude women having sex in front of the camera. I'll bet the actors aren't even lesbians. I only watched three episodes of this sexist crap. Enough is enough.Those who think this series will aid lesbians in their quest for equal rights are kidding themselves. ""The L Word"" is part of the same context as obviously sexist serials such as ""Deadwood"". It's about pushing the limits of what's acceptable on TV. What will come next, I wonder?"
1,What Has . . .,". . . 18 legs and laments incessantly . . . 'The L Word'. These self inflicted dejected, disappointed, grieving, heart-sick, melancholy, miserable, bellyachers are the poster children for those groups of trendy home owning-high end European car driving-never satisfied with being successful-comfortable-financially stable-so all they do is whine about everything that nobody cares about. Could you tell I cannot stand this show even one inch. These characters put the 'Thirty-Something' cast to shame. My advice to the L chicks: get a life or maybe take all that time you spend in despair and do some volunteer work for the underprivileged. Just a suggestion."
3,something to please everyone?,"Would that all my friends had those bodies and I should include myself in that wish.There was plenty ""eye candy"".There could have been more substance.When Tina had the miscarriage there was little attention given to the affect it had on her and her relationship with Bette.The actor who played tennis pro Dana,in my opinion,was not athletic enough in appearence to be taken seriously in that role.These and other things didn`t stop me from enjoying and wanting to see more."
2,"""If we were a heterosexual you wouldn't of asked that""",Turns out lesbians arent that interesting. I saw an advertisement for this so I rented from the video store. I thought it would be a show that was about lesbians but I didn't realize that was the show. It's all about how homosexuals get treated differently. I don't understand how people could enjoy this.
4,Review,"Unfortunatly you send me the serie without disc 1 so i can't give you an acurate review; i did like the serie do, and i look forward to get the second season.Thanx"
5,So hooked..............,"Well basically the show is off the hook. Im a loyal viewer. All of the characters bring this new racy show to modern experimental moments that we maybe want to do but are afraid. Anyway Great show so have to have it when it comes on dvd and will b ready for the second season, god I love it!"
4,Fabulous!,"This series is like potato chips, you can't stop with just one! I highly recommend purchasing the next season too."
2,Disk errors,"At the end of each disk there was a disk error that would force the dvd to ""skip the damaged area"" usually with around 10 minutes left."
5,Best of the Seasons,I don't watch tv but I used to download this. It's so good I bought it. LOVE it.
5,Simply awesome,"I got this dvd a while back and i have watched it over and over. I put it in at work and let it play in the background while I am working too. Joe and his band sound great together and I particularly like the opening solo. For those who like blues rock this dvd will not disappoint. I found it interesting also the different sounds he gets from each of his guitars and i loved the volume technique on the third song, 'Blues Deluxe'. get this dvd."
5,The BEST Live Concert DVD!,"This should be the FIRST concert DVD in anyone's collection as far as I'm concerned. The audio and video work it the best of any concert I've collected on DVD...and there are many. I do want to clarify one thing for people who may not be too familiar with Joe B's playing.....yes, he does play the blues BUT...calling him a blues guitarist is a bit misleading. He's more of a rock guy than people give him credit for...with his influences being Cream-era Clapton, Jimmy Page, Billy Gibbons etc. All these guys also delved into the blues realm but they're truly rock guitarists...just as Joe is. This ISN'T a Stevie Ray Vaughn type of concert...all blues shuffles and 12-bar ballads. What you get here are great rock tones on several different guitars with the solid backing of Kenny Kramme (drums) and Eric Czar(bass).My favorite DVD in my collection by far."
4,Great Talent,Joe Bonamassa is a great talent but I think he overdoes it on this one drawing his songs out. I would have liked to hear more variety of his music and songs than one long drawn out version.
5,Worth watching twice or more,I only discovered Joe Bonamassa about a month ago when a friend gave me a copy of Had to Cry Today. I then purchased this DVD and was blown away with Joe's skills. It's the kind of music video that you want your friends to have cause you know they will love it.
4,mixed emotions,"First of all, Joe Bonamassa is a blues god. My only complaint about this DVD, is the editing. There are FAR too many cut aways to the bass player (Eric Czar). Like in the middle of Joes blazing solos, they cut to the bass player. I did'nt buy this DVD to watch an arrogant showboating bass player. ""Hey Eric, bass players are a dime a dozen, so get out of Joes spotlight and let him do his thang!"""
4,Joe tears it up!,"I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about concerning the audio options for this DVD. My copy includes both a DTS surround and stereo option that both sound outstanding. As a matter of fact, the DTS track is one of the best I have ever heard - deep bass, excellent instrument clatity, and Joe's guitar rips through the mix with incredible power. The short set list is a slight disappointment, compaired to the ""New Day Yesterday Live"" DVD, but what you do get is phenomenal."
3,Artsy...,"for those who like Artsy documentaries, it's okay. It suits it's purpose for those looking for something different in this type of genre."
3,Three stars for shoddy DVD,"The film itself is beautiful...the transfer of it to DVD is not. The film is a critique on the struggle between man's carnal desires and his spiritual obligation to the Catholic Church--a theme Bunuel constantly explores in his films. Either you like surrealism or you don't. A man shoots himself in the head--his shoes and gun are lying on the floor while his body is splayed across the ceiling--very odd. A cow is used as a household pet, taking the place of a dog--very odd indeed. A couple is engaged in a cannibalistic romance, the female apparently chews off her lover's caressing fingers--very Bayonne, NJ to say the least. And at the end of the film, Jesus Christ is associated with depraved sex fiends--highly offensive--I did not care for that, but again, it sticks to the theme. Veiwer discretion is advised."
2,Stick with Un Chien Andalou and skip this,"The movie has some interesting, if crudely executed, images such as a cow in a bed, a giraffe tossed from a second-story window, a woman literally sucking off a man's fingers and Jesus portrayed as a serial-killing pedophile. Yet somehow it manages to be boring.Director Luis Bunuel mostly lectures the viewer with heavy-handed symbolism and forgets to be coherent (even within his surrealist format) and has many pointless, dull scenes such as the rebellious peasants at the beginning.As for the DVD, the image looks OK for its age but could've been cleaned up better.The commentary track is poor. The film historian lets lengthy passages and many interesting images go by without comment, and when he does comment, his words overflow with academic jargon."
5,must see,"The diffinative surrealist masterpiece OF ALL TIME. Banned for 50 years/Andre Brenton said :""L'AGE D'OR"" says it all and all others must follow!!! If you love surrealism you must see this film!!If you don't get it, see it till you do."
4,look at European inner cities and poverty,"The problem studied here describes how in a European city, the poor might cluster in neighbourhoods, and where this acts to further isolate them from employment and the mainstream society. While some cities in the book might be unfamiliar to an American reader, she should have no problem relating much of the discussion to American cities that she has visited.Interesting conclusions are found. For Dutch single mothers, social networks are seen as vital. Also, Holland has a welfare state that has largely prevented the formation of downtrodden neighbourhoods. Plus, the single mothers still took part in society, from child-related activities for example. While single males were far more likely to exclude themselves and have more serious behavioural problems like addiction or psychosis."
5,A beautiful book,This book will always have a special place in our family. It has a great message that you'll remember long after you put down the book.
1,Anno Hideki at his most severe,"Dont get me wrong, this was a great movie. between the mad low res camera, and the disgusting sexual situations, it suceeds in what it sets out to do: Disgust you. For at least two hours after I watched it I felt literally sick to my stomach, and even now I find it hard to to sleep as I think about it. It was similar to the feelings I got from watching the end of evangelion, however this was more powerfull, and felt less like a glimpse into anno's mind, and more like a plunge into darkness"
5,Awesome!,"Lincoln's ""Let the Praises Ring"" CD is just awesome from track 1 throughout the entire CD. His guitar playing, band, & vocals uplift you so one cannot help but sing along. What a wonderful voice and musical talent he has been blessed with! You can feel his energy in each song.Since our move from Northern California, we definitely miss worshipping along with Lincoln and our former church; but, this CD helps A LOT!"
5,Worship CD,"A fantastic worship cd with a difference - it will take me a log time to get sick of this one. While I already knew most of the songs, it was good to hear them again differently."
4,This was perfect for my 2 year old son!,"This is such a cute costume for my son! My older son is Batman and my younger is Robin for Halloween and Comic con this year. The size was labeled appropriately and my son looks adorable in this costume. The mask is a little off, but I plan to cut around the eye holes a little bit and it should be perfect for him."
4,halloween costume,"I am a Halloween nut so purchased my kids costumes in July. Kids age 3, 2 and 1 are Batman, robin and wonder woman. The costume looks great and I think it will fit my average sized two year old well. He is 28 pounds. My advice is read all of the reviews regarding sizing. I ordered based on reviews and would not have ordered the sizes that I did If I had not researched the sizing."
4,Great costume.,My 4 year-old loves costumes and loves this one as much as his others. The fake muscle and cute and the he loves wearing the mask. Fast shipping.
3,Robin Costume,"This is a typical costume, good for a night and then added to the costume box for additional use. My grandson had his heart set on this for Halloween."
4,Robin costume for toddler,"SO I debated over which size constumes to buy for weeks- just because of all the mixed reviews.I finally settled on the size ""Toddler"" 2-4 for ages 1-2 for my hefty 2 year old. He is a little bigger than most 2 year olds, but not HUGE. Anyhow, the costume looked SUPER tall when I pulled it out- but length-wise it fit rather well. It is however, very tight in the arms. There is not much ""give"" because of the fabric for the muscles. So, my Mom is planning on altering it. All in all, it's a good fit for the average 1-2 year old. But if your child is on the heftier size, be prepared for it to be snug in certain areas.As for the costume quality, it's not horribly made, but could stand to be a little bit neater. I just keep in mind, it's a costume for Halloween. The kids will wear it one day - and it's fine. I'm Sure they'll get some dress up out of it afterwards as well. All in all, it was a good buy ($25 with free super savers shipping).Good luck!!!"
3,Extension cord winder,"This works okay,I would not pay full price for this. The one thing that is good the cord stays neat."
3,Handy but not perfect,"The Wonder Winder is very useful in that it stores and pays out lengthy electrical cords that otherwise would be cumbersome to deal with. It does indeed store 150 ft. of cord and the winding mechanism works. However, we find that winding that much cord into the basket requires a lot of cranking and, at times, the winding wheel slips on the cord making the process longer. Overall, we find the product worth while but less than perfect."
5,Wonder Winder is a real wonder.,This is my second wonder winder. I use these in my woodworking shop and for garden power tools. These units are high quality and inexpensive. Best part is I no longer have an electrical cord mess.
5,Highly recommended,"I have bought 2 of these. Holds over 100' of cord but is inexpensive. The only improvement would be to have a stronger catch mechanism to the mounting platform. If I'm not careful, while cranking the cord in the units twists a little and comes out of the wall mount. Not a major problem but a bit of a nuisance."
4,Works great!,"I was skeptical about this winder being that it's so cheap (in price). I got it installed about 6 months ago in my garage and it's been awesome since! Very easy to pull the cord out into my yard when I need to run the leaf blower, or for using my shopvac or palm sander etc. The cord winds back up better than I could have imagined. Great product!"
3,Works ok,"The one I have has a rigid mount & does not swivel side to side as the picture appears. You have to have a rubber coated cord, the softer the better. I had to use an old cord rather than the new one I bought because the wheel would not grip the new one."
1,"All plastic, Junk","I loved the concept of this winder. Unfortunately, the winding handle is so flimsy it broke after just three or four uses. Back to my old cord winder."
1,"Good Idea, Sorry Product","I bought this thinking it would solve my cord bird nest problems but it just frustrated me. The lever would not provide any ""grab"" and just slipped. The basket was very shoddy and looked as if it would hold about 35 feet rather than 150'. It also showed the optional swivel bracket and didn't mention it was an option. The mount that came with it was a plastic stationary mount. Totally sorry product. DO NOT waste your money on this."
4,Buy Two,I bought two as gifts.......... One person is very happy and the other is waiting for a return authorization to return the product for a replacement. We received one without the Packaged parts. We have to return the whole thing instead of being able to just have the parts shipped to us. We will be ordering a few more because they are handy but I am hoping that all the parts will be included!
2,Good Idea,For this product to work you need two hand to operate it. One to crank and one to hold down the friction plate. It would be great if there was a way to lock the friction plate down.
2,Great Idea... Poor Performance,"My 10 year old 100' cord was looking a little tired along with its hand winder... I saw the Wonder Winder advertised and dispite the warnings posted here and other sites; I made the leap...It took two of us to wind up a new 100' 14/2 cord in warm weather... Not to be stymied, I bought a can of belt dressing... Better... but as they say at the carnival... ""Close but no cigar""The idea is great but the gripper does not work well... Now my new cord has the used look because of the rub marks from the take up wheel..I would hope that those of you who are thinking of buying this and using 14/2 or larger would think to opt out....It might be good for lighter cords, but for my tools I need a minimum of 14/2 so it doesn't work... It probably will end up in the give away sack....If it smells like a lemon, slices like a lemon, it probably is....."
5,Wonder Winder,"The Wonder Winder is one of the best products I have purchased. It is easy to load, wind, and unwind."
1,Worthless wonder winder,"I have had this worthless piece of junk on my garage wall for nearly two years and have yet been able to make it work. I have taken it apart, reassembled and still it will NOT wind up a 100' extension cord. Period."
2,It's a Lightweight,"I purchased to use with leaf and snow blowers and use a 14/3 extension cord. I couldn't get it to work with that gauge and I doubt anyone can. I should have read the reviews more carefully. Probably good with more typical, lighter load cords."
3,A good product,"This does just what it's supposed to do. But on mine, the basket pulled off the winder and is tricky to put back on. A wire holds the netting in place around the neck of the winder."
1,Don't waste your money,"This thing is garbage, sent it back, doesn't work at all. It is very cheaply made as well."
1,Toys R 4 kids,"This thing is useless. Flimsy material & craftsmanship. Won't last one season-I guaruntee...They should pay you to buy this product. Save your money & frustrations. My rubber wheel fell apart after 6 months, and it never did coil the wire properly."
3,"Works well, not high quality",This seems to work fine not but it is made really cheaply. I would not recommend this for someone who plans on using it all the time. It should work for me because I only pull out the extension cord every few weeks.
3,It works OK,It is sometimes difficult to reel in the extension cord as the cord slips against the wheel. I have figured out how to make it work by pushing very hard on the friction lever while winding.
4,This is our 2nd Wondeer Winder. First one was 20 years old and worn out .,"If you have an odd shape property like ours, this device comes in handy. We use it in the front and back yard."
1,"Cheap, not well made.",Does not work very well in winding up the cord. Looks like it will break after just a few uses.
5,These work well,very easy to put together and install. Can't think of a better way to keep electrical cords. I have several that house 100 ft. of cord.
2,Junk,Just tried to wind 150 feet light weight extension cord in this piece of drek. It's incapable of maintaining constant feed. Kept stopping and I'd have to pull out 2-3 feet and start again. Took forever. Great idea but lacking in execution.
1,Should be called WonderBinder,I have had this thing in my shop for 3 mo. Every time I use it it binds up with just the short cord. The crank has broke 3 times and had to be fixed. The wall mount it comes with is not that good due to the locking part slips out (the picture showes a swivle mount but it somes with a stationary mount). It does do one thing well.... It kinks the cord real well.. Spend a little more and get a real retac cord or a little less and get a spoole (the spoole takes less work to wind.
1,Items never arrived,"I'd love to be able to review this item. Unfortunately, I am still waiting to get it. As Amazon has been excellent about delivering items on time or even early, I am surprised and disappointed. This item was not packaged by Amazon, so it might be a good idea to avoid this seller given their delivery problems.I checked the online tracking to see what had become of it. The tracking information indicates that it was delivered. I was home all day yesterday and no delivery was made.Any suggestions on how to proceed?"
1,Fell apart in the first few minutes.,"Must have had a defective unit, but this thing fell to pieces when I tried to reel the cord in. I was too busy to deal with it so I never sent it back. I tried to fix it but couldn't. Didn't work for me at all."
5,WW-1 Wonder Winder,"Great product! Eliminates tangled extension cord. A ""must have"" for do-it-yourselfers."
4,WOW It really works,"I read many of the reviews for this item, and decided I would give it a try. IT WORKS!!. Simple installation (mounting piece is a little off center). Worked as advertised. If installing in the summer no need to lay out cord. Easily rolled and held, 100ft of medium weight extension cord. Mounting bracket takes 4 screws to secure it. Screws are included for one bracket, but you will have to get more if you want to mount the other bracket. I will be buying another one for my workshop and barn."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this a couple of years ago. It's a nice idea, but I am disappointed with how it works. If the jacket on your extension cord is at all wet, like when I rewind the cord after using my electric snow blower, it won't catch and rewind the cord. The reel will just spin. I have to press as hard as I can on the black thingy to even get it to engage under normal circumstances. Yeah it's sturdy, and when it works it is cool, but I am disappointed with how inconsistent it is."
4,Good for the price,"This is a pretty good product. It's a little cheaply made, but then it's pretty cheaply priced too, and the design is pretty clever. Mine works fine and I use it with some heavy duty cords. Maybe those who couldn't wind it should read the directions. If you don't push the lever, it doesn't wind, but when you use it according to the instructions, it works great."
5,Why did I not buy this years ago?,A handy little gadget. I use it to store 100' of medium duty cord for my snow thrower. Works great. It feeds out only the amount of cord I need and then I just put tension on the handle and start winding. Works flawlessly!
5,Quick Cable Cleanup,"I tried a lot of cable reels but this one really works! I use a 100' extension for my yard tools and though I carefully reel it in or coil it, it generally gets tangled or knotted when I reach the edges of the yard. The Wonder Winder makes cleanup/storage quick and there's never a tangle or knot when you pull it out. It takes less than 2 minutes to reel my cord in and when it's done it's safely stowed out of the way. It's a great addition to my shop and I only wish I'd purchased it sooner. I'm dumping the reels!"
3,OK.,This device has to have the perfect electrical cord to work. It has to be very flexible to be wound up in the device.
5,Great little tool,I have had a Wonder Winder for 3 years. Why no one else make competitively is beyond me. It's just great.
3,Woner almost a Blunder,"When I first saw this product the mesh bag was of wire, now it's fishing net. Where the rubber meets rubber, to reel back in, could be improved upon, not to mention being fully assembled when recieved. It would be nice to see all the included hardware include with the product (mine did not). I do wish for the former days of Ma an Pa stores who gave you a product with integrity, but even I have circum to the convienance of the internet. That being said this product is much better than the wind up reel I had, but time will tell just how many cranks before this one cracks up."
5,cord winder,"These extension cord winders are wonderful products.I just replaced one of 20 years that broke only by my hitting it with a power washer and broke the netting.I have recomendeded this product to many friends whom also bought them , and yes I will purchase others in the future.Would also recommend to others looking to keep cords organized and easy for storage."
3,Using a partially wound cord can be dangerous.,"May be great for storage, but google, 'using wound power cords and extension cords'. Or, google, 'uncoil extension cords for use'. I saw the negative comment and don't care. My comment is based on real experience."
5,Great product!,"I have to admit, when my husband told me he wanted one of these for Christmas, I thought it was one of those TV gadgets that just looked handy, but wouldn't ever be used. But, I humored him, and ordered this for him. Well, after he installed it on the garage wall, I went out and tried it out. It works great! He uses cords in the garage and I use them in the yard, so no more cord-winding for us. Plus, it's stored out of the way up on the wall. 5 stars for the Wonder Winder!"
3,"A little quirky, but not all that bad","This product works better on lightweight extension cords. It has trouble ""grabbing"" 14 and 12 guage cords. If the extension cords are wet forget about it, you'll have to hand-feed the cord into the holding basket because the drive wheel is just not ""sticky"" enough to grab the heavy cords. Even if you have to hand-feed the extension cord into the basket, which is rather tedious, this Wonder Winder is still a good option to store an extension for an electric snowblower or lawn mower."
2,Received with missing parts.,"It's a bit annoying when you buy something as a gift and the gift receiver has to later tell you that there was a part missing. In this case, the crank was not included in the box thus making the entire thing utterly useless. The packaging was very plain and nondescript which had me wishing I hadn't bought it as a gift in the first place. It was just a basic craft colored cardboard box - not somehting you would pick up at the store to give as a gift. The first time the gift recipient looked at it he thought it was one of those small basketball hoops. Maybe a single color photo would have been appropriate SOMEWHERE on the box or inside the packaging. Now we're off tho start the return process. Thankfully, Amazon is the best at what they do so it won't be a huge problem."
4,great storage,"worked great, in winter hard to roll up stiff wire,switched to polar solar wire works fine both were 16/3. would recommend"
2,Wish it worked as well as it sounds,"It the Wonder Winder worked as well as described it would be a great product. Unfortunately, it doesn't. The main problem I experience is that it won't rewind a 12 gauge 3 wire cord AT ALL - the cord simply slips between the drive wheel and what they call the ""yoke"" and won't feed into the basket. I tried it with 16 gauge 3 wire cord and had the same problem - no rewinding. Maybe if the yoke wasn't made from pretty flimsey plastic, more pressure could be brought to bear on the winding wheel and it would grip the cord better. But as it is, it doesn't work for me AT ALL and it's going to be returned. One other thing - the actual size of the net cord basket is much smaller than in the picture."
1,Not well made!,"They claim this will hold 150 feet of cord. Not so, unless it's some small gauge. It won't hold even 100 feet of 12/3. When I gave up on that, and loaded 14/3 into it, the basket came off."
2,Spinning my wheels,"Bought this unit to hold a 100' 12/3 extension cord I use for my electric snow blower. It went together and mounted on the wall easy enough but the handle with the wheel doesn't grip the cord. I am left turning the crank with no movement to the cord. It appears that the wheel is not ""grippy"" enough to pull the cord into the basket. Nice try, but it doesn't work for me."
1,didn't work for me.,"I thought this would be useful in the garage, but i ended up throwing it away.1: It takes up too much space. Top to bottom is like 20 inches. The top and side both need to be within reach. I've got shelving and work benches all around my garage, so where was absolution no convenient space to mount it. If you have open wall space (like 2x3 feet) for it, it may work for you2: Basket is thin nylon string. I did not feel like it would last long with my 100' heavy duty power cable. I wouldn't expect it to hold more than a 50 foot light duty cable.I'm currently using one of those buckets from home depot to hold my cables. It seems more convenient."
3,Wonder Winder Issues,I recently purchased two of these units and both came the same way missing parts. The metal wall bracket and pin were not included. I called Wonder Winder and they are sending them out to me. A second issue it that the soft rubber belt on the cord roller is too loose and wonders off the roller as you reel cord in. I super glued the belts on which seems to have solved the problem. I have a unit that is about 10 years old and it seems to be better built.
5,Excellent electric cord storage,"The Green Leaf Wonder Winder is one of the simplest and most useful tools I have ever installed in my work area. I have two on either side of the area which gives me unmatched accesability to power whenever I need it. In addition I have an extra mounting in another area of the room and one just outside the door which makes it even more flexible. Sometimes I have to play a little with the traction mechanism, but I consider that a small price to pay for the huge benefit of this tool. I wouldn't want to be without it. I recommend it to anyone."
3,"Cheap materials, affraid to go hard on it",Got this to clean up the looks of the garage. All in all it worked good as long as the extension cord is not wet. If the extension cord is wet the reel can't get friction to wind the cord and your stuck hand feeding it in which is not easy. Aside from that I'm very concerned that the plastic will be breaking somewhere somehow but we'll see.
4,Good Product,"I installed this cord winder-storer on the metal column of storage shelves I purchased at IKEA. It took less than 10 minutes. I also purchased with this device 100 ft of 14 gauge low-temp flex cord.Winding is easy--much easier than I thought it would be. Great way to store 100 ft of cord. I used the cord and winder with a Toro electric snow blower recently when we got a 21"" snowfall. I was very pleased with accessibility of the cord; it pulled out evenly and easily. Retrieving the cord and winding into the net basket was equally easy.I speculate that the low-temp flex cord made this winder work as well as it did."
3,OK for light cords,"Like many other reviewers I found that the winder absolutely refused to function with a quality (i.e. thick and heavy) 50ft 12ga cord. I had to apply an extremem amount of pressure to the ""lever"" to get it to even make any forward progress. Even then, progress was exceptionally slow due to the reel slipping. I gave up, and will be returning this winder as my only need was to wind up a heavy 12ga cord in my garage. Perhaps it would work just fine with a 14ga or 16ga cord, but I don't own any of those so I couldn't try it."
5,I own 4 wonder winders - great for type A people,"I bought one, loved it, bought 2 more , and 2 more again. (one for a friend). One in the garage another for the backyard, same for 2nd home. No reason to leave unwound, it is so easy. If you are an organized type A person it is a must have."
5,"Great Product, and Great Customer Service","My father-in-law has had his Wonder Winder for a few years now, and it is still working flawlessly. So, we picked one up, I mounted it, and realized that there was a part missing. I called up the Green Leaf, expecting a run around, or having to buy the part. Instead, there were no questions asked, and they shipped it out in three days. VERY happy with this product and company. Would recommend to anyone who has a problem with extension cords running all over the place as we did."
4,less functional in cold weather,"When it's cold the cord is stiff and the large pinch wheel doesn't grip as well. However, it's a great concept. All parts are good quality. Be patient and don't force it."
5,Awesome Winder!!!,"I bought this product back in 2011. It was very quick to install, and I liked how easy it would be to switch the handle over to the other side had I needed to install it that way. The cord really does wrap in a perfect circle in the basket! I was pleasantly surprised. Other reviewers have mentioned that sometimes the cord sticks and won't move during retraction. I had this happen once, and realized that a little more force on the lever was all that was required to keep the cord moving. This unit works off of friction between the crank and a roller on the end of a lever. If you don't put pressure on the lever to keep enough pressure on the cord, the cord isn't going to move when you turn the crank. This little machine is honestly about the coolest cord winder I have ever seen. I put it on the wall in my garage, and I use it constantly! I plan to buy another in the near future to put out on my back deck. Spectacular product!"
3,Wonder Winder,The Wonder Winder arrived as specified if may have come early.Wonder Winder works most of the time. It has a little trouble if the cord is wet also when it is dirty. I discovered that if you rough up the main wheel with some sand paper or a rough file it truly helps. Give it a tryI realy like that I can wind up my cords so fast with the Wonder Winder.It makes my work area look alot cleaner with no cords on the floor.
2,Good idea but ...,"This seems like a great idea but my initial reaction is ""what a pain"". I've loaded the two I purchased with 12/3 75' extension cords and the wheels keep slipping. I have tried applying various amounts of tension on the clutch, watching the cord alignment, and watching to ensure that the cord isn't catching on anything. It just keeps slipping. It does coil nicely and it does hold the entire cord: but, it has been a pain to wind. Maybe it will improve with use but so far, yuch!"
2,Doesn't work with my US Wire 98100 14/3 100-Foot SJEOW TPE Cold Weather Extension Cord Blue with Lighted Plug,This doesn't seem to work with my US Wire 98100 14/3 100-Foot SJEOW TPE Cold Weather Extension Cord Blue with Lighted Plug.The cable slips between the roller and yoke and it takes 10 mins to wind this thing up. Maybe because the cord has some sort of waxy coating - but frankly I think the design is lacking because the roller and yoke simply can't grab onto the cord sufficiently.
5,Made My Wife Smell a Lot Better,"We are having our bathroom remodeled, so our shower is inoperable. So the Cabotine Gres spray for ladies has been a valued addition to our household. Thank you for making such a fine product available."
1,fake,I have the real one and it's amazing. This one is not the same! It's fake or reformulated. It's more synthentic and missing warm and sexy scent. Very upset with my purchase.
5,Good bluegrass without the singing,"I love the bluegrass music style, but can't stand the singing, ever. This fits the bill. Popular songs that I can listen to over and over."
2,Beware - NOT Fowler brand!,"I ordered this set a few days ago, because it was an excellent price for a Fowler transfer punch set. ([...]). But when I received the shipment, I discovered that it is NOT a Fowler set, but a cheap Chinese knockoff. The box was dented in several places, and the inside had several ""stains"" from machine oil that had dripped off the punches. I was very upset. The part number on the box was the same as the true Fowler part number, in an apparent effort to fool prospective buyers. Don't be fooled! If you want a cheap set, there are less expensive sets available at Amazon. If you want a true Fowler set, look elsewhere."
2,Not all hard,I got them and they looked good when I went to use them the one I needed was to soft to use the point went flat so I checked them all on the Rock Well and found 11 to soft to use. I payed for the better ones and got this junk. Not happy. I do not think they were Fowler
1,Garbage,These transfer punches are absoloute garbage. I broke the tip off of one during its first use. I'll be sending this product back.
4,Wonderful pictures,"This book is a little pricey, but the photographs inside this coffee-table book are incredible. Not the run of the mill technical photos, some of these came from private collections, showing a slice of life in and around these plants.It's actually kind of fun to take the book out and see how the landscape has changed over the years.PS- If you are solely looking for technical photos of devices assembly and production areas, you will be disappointed. Get Chuck Hansen's book instead."
5,What a great book!,"A nice view of the human side of the Los Alamos Project: It was more than just building a bomb, you know."
1,NOT WORTH BUYING AT ALL!!!!!!,"While this book does have pictures of the Manhattan Project, about only 1% of them are of actual nuclear-related stuff. Mostly it's pictures of people growing up on the Los Alamos project. I found only a few pictures of bombs exploding. The rest of the pictures are boring! This book is NOT worth buying!!!!!!"
4,Flickerstick live,"I must admit that I have not taken to this album as much as I have the others after only 1 or 2 listens. I'm still trying to find a standout track on this live cut, whereas on prior live albums there are multiple standout tracks. I'd also have to say that there are better live versions of the same songs on their prior live album. I'll give this cd many more listens before I decide if it is a keeper or a coaster, but so far I'm not blown away with this album like I have been with almost all of Flickerstick's prior work. The 2 ""new"" musicians that have joined the band in the absence of Corey and Dom are quite impressive artists. One final note. It is nice to have 3 videos included in this package. Thanks to Flickerstick for going above and beyond what that have to and giving their fans a few added gems."
5,BEST DVD PLAYER I HAVE SEEN!,"This is the Best Dvd player i have ever seen. Wide screen, and does not have slow movie time ; highly recommended"
2,Whaat is this all about?,"I think Jordan doesn't have a good voice at all. She's just like any other girl on Disney trying to make "" it big"" The only song I really like is "" outside Looking in"" Just because of the lyrics and the tune is catchy. I thought her album would be like the single but all of the other songs are stupid. One of the songs "" Teenager"" I couldn't help but laugh. It was all about not wanting to do chores, like making her bed. I guess she meant it like she's just a teenager, what do you excpect? This cd makes me wonder if Disney is just picking pretty faces to become singers, instead of true talent!"
3,Could have been so much better,"Jordan is an amazing singer. Her voice is special and very unique, and therefore her voice shines on every song. I decided to check out her album after hearing 'Jump To The Rhythm.' I was disappointed. I don't mean to be harsh, but the lyrics in her songs simply don't do her beautiful voice justice. The title of this album is very true - when it comes to her voice. Her songs? Not so much. This kind of material could easily have been found on a JoJo album or something like that. It was too poppy for me. But some songs are bearable, and her voice is great, so I'm giving her three. If you are into this kind of generic teen pop, then this album is for you. If not, then I don't think you'll be interested. Hopefully she'll change her style up a bit for her next album."
3,not for me,Come on I mean you decerve to have a cd thats alittle bit more spendeyer.And her songs werent to great either.I didnt buy it because of her songs.At least if you like her songs then buy it and give them alittle bit more money.
2,"Nah, skip it","she's not my kind of singer. She's good but not my taste.the only song tahts really good on the album is the one everyone knows.you dont know my name> you dont know anything about me. etc..if you like miley cyrus, you may like it. I reccomend listening first then buying, cause.. well i dont really care for her."
3,This is WJJJWW's daughter,"I love Jordan Pruitt's voice but this CD isn't as good as I thought. Most of the songs sound about the same. I only like 3 songs, Jump to the Rhythm, Outside Looking In, and We Are Family. The others are OK. My mom thinks that the lyrics in Teenager are disrespectful, it says ""I like staying up all night, I think it's my right, Sleepin till' noon, I love watching scary movies, I could stay shopping all day, Getting my way, And trying on shoes, Don't tell me what i should be doing."" I hope if she makes another CD that it's better than this one."
4,"Safe Teen Themes, Cool Album","It's kind of hard to keep up with all the new young singers on the scene. Okay, well here is the back story on Jordan Pruitt. She wasn't a part of the recent High School Musical Tour-but she did open on the tour. She is signed to Hollywood Records, a company which releases a lot of Disney related albums. Whereas a lot of the ""new school"" girls are going for a pop/R&B; edge, Jordan seems to walk the line of rock and pop.No Ordinary Girl is a very tween/teen oriented album. The song themes are perfect for the high school scene. Songs like ""Miss Popularity"" and ""Teenager"" are sure to resonate with the teen scene. ""Over It"" is sure to be a popular break up song."
4,"Appropriate -harmless, teenage pop.","I don't mind my children listening to this album. It's harmless pop, and Jordan is a talented young lady, I think her voice is special. Of course, I'm going to rank her music on a different standard than more mature artists. I'm comparing her to the likes of Hannah Montana, Ashley Tisdale, and Jesse McCartney.No Ordinary Girl - 4/5Miss Popularity - 5/5Over It - 3/5Teenager - 4/5Outside Looking In - 5/5We Are Family - 4/5Waiting For You - 5/5Jump To The Rhythm - 4/5My Reality - 5/5Who Likes Who - 3/5Later - 3/5When I Pretend - 5/5"
3,"Good Singer, Okay Album","Jordan Pruitt is a true singer and I place her in a completley other league then singers like miley cyrus and lindsay lohan. Her singing is great and she is a true musical artist unlike her disney label mates. She had so much going for her to be a huge success. But her album was only okay, many of the songs sounding extremley similar. The album did not chart well, and that is partly due to the decisions that she/her label made. Although ""Outside Looking In,"" was a beautiful/power song to release as a first single, it didnot have much commercial appeal. She could have released a song like ""Waiting For You,"" or ""Over It,"" and I think she probably would have been more succesful. I still think this girl has a lot of talent, and although ""No Ordinary Gir,"" is a decent wholesome album, she can do better."
1,Worked Great- Once!,"Well, it worked great on some plastic lawn furniture, the deck and surrounding wood structures, and removed grime from the bricks very well. Unfortunately, after storing the washer for less than one month (inside a building away from the weather), a connector in the handle broke and caused the water to leak out of the handle. So it worked once. Oddly enough, after exchaning the product, the exact same thing happened- with extra care in storing the washer the second time. In addition, a relative purchased the same washer shortly after our original purchase, and had the exact same experience. We may not have the best luck, but this was not a good experience."
1,Very bad quality on parts,"It seem they really want to cut the cost down to getting a higher profit margin. It work just for 1st 5 min, then the inlet connector to the garden hose broke. Since, they use a very brittle pastic. During assembly, I already very carfully install the hose. It seem there is no quick way to fix it. The only way you can do is return it to get the credit back.I don't know why how they pass the realibilty test.Really really bad design and don't waste the money!!!!!"
1,Handle Sucks,"I'll be returning my second washer tomorrow. They do work great when they work, however the handles only seem to be good for about two or three hours of uses before they fail."
2,Karcher 360 A Piece of Junk,"I've read all the reviews and surprised my problem seems to be unique.The entire gun assembly seems to have blown a ga-zillion O rings, washers or whatever. The third time I used it water just started leaking all up and down the gun. I have taken it apart and could not see where some o ring or something of the sort was missing. Put it back together and the ... thing still leaks to high heaven.What's worse. Don't remember where I bought it and the instruction manual to advise where to get service disappeared ..."
2,Karcher 330 M Pressure Washer,"I purchased a Karcher 330 last year and it worked very well for cleaning stairs and siding on the house. This year when I set out to do the same cleaning tasks it developed a leak in the plastic housing that the water hose connects. I finally found a company that sold parts (pressureparts-very good co.) and I ordered the part. After installing the new part, the machine now will not shut off. I've tried unsuccessfully find a repair shop (in the US) to take the machine to for diagnostics / repairs. It's very frustrating to learn that the only repair shops are in the UK and Ireland!!!! Why doesn't this company have any support facilities in the US where they sell these machines?"
1,Cheap parts,"The valve in the trigger handle is very weak. I purchased a unit and was initially very pleased. On my recommendation, my mother-in-law also purchased one. We have each replaced the unit three times under warranty ( a total of six )becasue the valve would self destruct and water would pour from the handle. My last failure was on the low pressure setting and during only the second use of the replacement. Save your money and buy quality in another brand."
1,Save your money,The power washer is poorly constructed and is mechanically flawed. The one I purchased worked only (poorly) the 1st time I used it. The 2nd time the electrical motor burnt up. It went to the dumpster where it belonged - along with the $... plus tax and shipping that I paid for it.The company who manufactured this should be ashamed of itself for putting such a poor product on the American market. If they don't like my evaluation sue me - I am a lawyer.
4,Worth It,I found the washer able to do what I wanted and more. It is easy to use and changing heads takes seconds.
3,Made my deck look like new,"Actually, just the portion I have done so far. I've got a big deck, and I was able to clean at about 50 square feet per hour (including railings). I needed to have nozzle about three inches from area being cleaned to have spray at right power to get mildew out. (I don't know what it should usually take). One annoying thing-the water inlet piece (the part that attaches to the house's water hose) popped off every time I moved the unit (5 times), requiring me to interrupt my work several times to shut off the water and snap the piece back into place."
1,Good Performance but too Cheaply Built,"When it's new and before the plastic parts starting breaking apart, it gets the job done admirably. Follow the directions to the letter, treat it very gently and it just may last you a while. The problem with this unit is that it is just so cheaply built it's ridiculous. It could also be that it's powerful for it's own good, because the trigger valve is often the first thing to go. According to a long-time repairman in the power washer business, this is often referred to as a ""throw away"" unit."
5,Did an excellent job on a grungy deck,"Used this on a deck that hadn't been washed in years. Worked like a champ. Also took the green algae off bricks and siding. And, at a lower pressure, did a great job of washing the car, saving water because of the built in trigger feature. We're very pleased with it."
3,bakes well but warps from heat,"goods come out great, just as you'd expect from a layered/insulated sheet. it was shipped to me perfectly flat, but the warping problem is indeed pretty terrible no matter what, even with good care and light usage the heat will just bend this thing beyond all recognition after a few uses.not such a big deal if you normally work with thick doughs or smaller pieces that set fast, but anything more viscous will yield very uneven thickness in the direction of any slants in the sheet, ie. things like pizza with sauce and cheese, then you're better off sticking with a single layered sheet that will not warp."
3,I was hoping for a better outcome,"I love my ""regular"" size Airbake cookie sheets, so although other reviews warned me about uneven baking, I took a chance on these. Unfortunately, they were right. I use a gas oven, and the cookies in the middle of the sheet were not done, while the ones on the edges were. So unless you enjoy taking some of the cookies off of the sheet part of the way through, I would just stick with the regular size Airbake sheet."
4,Sure makes baking cookies a lot easier!,Took no time at all to bake the cookies with my new sheets as they were so large that it took half the time to bake cookies!
1,Don't Buy!,"Beware. . .I have washed and greased the brand new cookie sheet five (5) times or more, and black still keeps appearing on paper towel that rubbed Crisco on pan. This is a chemical that is in the cookie sheet that I suspect couldn't be safe. T FAL will not refund you your money back. When asked, they said it was made in China, of course. They say they are no longer making cookie sheets. My 15-20 yr old Wearever Airbake was made in Wisconsin, and it was great. :-("
1,Like eating metal?,"I have two of these baking sheets, a jelly roll pan, and a cake pan. They were great for awhile. But after a few years of use they have started leaving flakes of metal in the food! After baking cookies, imagine my embarrassment when one of my guests noticed flecks of silver on the bottoms of the cookies! I checked my pans but can't see anything flaking off. Nevertheless, all four of these pans do indeed leave pieces of metal in the food. They still look like new so I can't quite figure it out. It must be when they reach baking temperature that this happens. The scary thing is that I have no idea how long we've been eating the bits of metal! I have been feeding food to all of my little kids from these pans for years!"
3,Too large cookie sheets,I did not expect these cookie sheets to be so large. I had looked at the size but still I did not realize that they would not begin to fit in my wall oven. I'm sure they would be great if I could use them.
4,Even baking,"This cookie sheet is exactly what i needed. It really maximized all of the room in my oven. The tray is sturdy and bakes very evenly. I docked a star because the rolled edge doesn't seem to be rolled over quite enough to keep the two pieces of sheet metal together. The underside of this cookie sheet is made of two pieces of metal. The rolled edge keeps the perforated sheet attached to the bottom. The perforated portion can slide away from the rolled edge leaving a gap. The perforated sheet also hangs down a little. Other than that slight issue, the cookie sheet is great. I would recommend that you double check your oven dimensions to be certain this sheet will fit."
5,Durable - great product!,"This cookie sheet has so many uses. Cooks my pizza evenly, bakes cookies perfectly - I used it to bake hot wings once too and that worked out well. I would highly recommend getting some high heat butcher paper (Amazon sells sustainable paper products for baking) - covering the cookie sheet with the paper makes clean up VERY easy and also helps keep stickier foods from getting stuck on your shiny airbake sheet. Very pleased with this purchase!"
5,greatest cookie sheet ever!,"I purchased one of these when they were available in Bed Bath & Beyond and absolutely loved the baked results. After many attempts to buy another one in stores, I called the company directly to find out where to buy, and they told me it was a discontinued item. I was devastated...I hate when a product you love to use gets wiped off the market.I did random searches online and couldn't believe Amazon carried them!!These are, by far, the BEST cookie sheets out there ever. The size alone gives you more space to work with ~ so, less individual baking time needed.Nothing sticks to the sheets. I have not had the need to spray or grease these sheets in any way. The secret is in the double insulated layers. You'll want to get at least 2 of these, for sure!"
2,Maybe for beginners,"If you like anecdotes and chit-chat in your lessons, then this will be good for you.If you're literally just starting out, this book will be helpful.I would be hesitant to recommend this book for intermediate users.Her process will help give a foundation for succesful texturing, but this book will not get you there all by itself.Her personal site has free PDFs on texturing as well as samples of her own work, so you can get an idea of her writing style and her own texturing abilities before you decide whether to buy this book. A quick Google search will give you her personal website. Amazon policy forbids me to list the exact url."
1,definitely for beginners,"The book is definitely for beginners, not for folks who already browsed the free lightwave tutorials on the net.I wasn't impressed by the content, and folks who are intermediate Lightwave user wont be either.I highly recommend another Lightwave book by a veteran Lightwave user with lots of credit in the 3D field. ""Lightwave 3d 8 Applied"" by Jennifer Hachigian, you wont be sorry getting Jenns book, she is tops...."
3,good book- but in Black and White ruins it,This is full of great inormation however why these book publishers only use back and white imagaes confuses me. This is an artist book ususally meaning we are VISUAL people. So why every image is on flat black and white is horrible for a Graphic computer book. HUGE TURN OFF!Other than that the text is informative but thats it!I hink most people read Maya books because they are on nice Glossy Full Colored pages. When you pay 35.00-75.00 for a book you expect some colored imgaes if not all.
4,Understanding the art of texturing,This book is definatly a must have for the serious artist who want to learn texturing. It covers every setting in the texture editor and explains the theory behind each one. I've been texturing models for a while and after reading this book it has given me new idea's and opend my eyes to the world in a different way.
3,"Beautiful design, good materials, marginal construction","This is a beautiful necklace unless you're looking at it very closely. The gold has a nice tone and polish on the outside, it's the classic Rolo chain pattern that is neither too funky nor too formal, and the chain has a decent weight that feels real. I bought this as a present for my wife and she is happy with it. My only gripe comes from looking closely at the links. They are nicely polished outside, but the inside of the links is a little rough. That takes away a bit from the overall shine and makes the movement of the chain less fluid than it could be. Amazon's price is pretty low for this kind of chain so I'm not too surprised that the quality is less than 100%. I would have felt more satisfied with the purchase if the manufacturer had gone that little bit further and made sure both the inside and outside of the links were polished and smooth."
1,Bogus Premise,"There is no such place called Arabian Gulf. The historical name is Persian Gulf. Anybody who does not know that basic fact is not qualified to write a book. Please go back to high school and earn your diploma, Mr. Farid."
2,Mostly rubbish,Mostly rubbish. Decent writing. Terrible story about uninteresting people that seem more like caricatures rather than characters. Save your reading time for something better.
5,One of the best comics produced today in a great package,"Planetary is the magnum opus of Warren Ellis and John Cassaday.This edition collects issues 1 -12 in a gorgeous oversided hardcover edition.Since these are the first issues of Planetary, this is a perfect place for newbies to start reading the series.The series features an eclectic mix of superhero, archeology, secret histories,ghost stories and good old fashioned mystery.Each story fits beautifully into main story arc of the series.The art by Cassaday is incredible and this edition's 12"" x 8"" glossy paper really brings that out.Absolutely wonderful."
1,Outdated and narrow-minded views of labor and birth,"I have reviewed numerous books on pregnancy and birth, and this is one of the worst. The author presents a one-sided description of a ""typical"" pregnancy, labor and delivery which totally ignores many of the alternatives available to women. Additionally, many of her descriptions of ""common"" prenatal, labor and delivery procedures are wildly outdated in 1998. Women reading this book today are reading about their mothers' deliveries; they will not be gaining useful information for their own."
4,Good handbook,The book is built up of short chapters that describe estimates and other aspects well. Fully delivers what is say it does!
5,Durable and Efficient,"This light works great in a real work environment. The plumbers and electricians drag it arround with them on the job. It gets bumped, hit, tipped over and etc. It works great, especially in an area where the light can be reflected off of the light colored interior surfaces. As a stand alone light in an area with dark surfaces it does not work as well as other work lights."
3,Joseph Irons - Discuraged user with warranty,"I have several of the wobble lights and am very happy with the product but when one of the lights stopped working, I had experienced a poor warranty and repair program.Horible customer service, great product when they work."
5,You don't have to LOVE cats to love this book,"I love poetry, and I like cats but am not a ""cat person""--and I ADORE this book. These are wonderful parodies, funny on their own, even funnier when you know the poem they're based on, and funniest of all when you add in the cat angle.I am amazed by Henry Beard's talent as I read them. The one based on Wordsworth's ""Daffodils"" is probably my favorite, but the Beowulf one is also great, as are the ""Xanadu"" and ""Paradise Lost"" ones. Actually, I should probably just say that they're all fantastic.This would make a wonderful gift for an English major, a cat lover, a poetry lover, a writer, anyone who does public speaking, anyone who works in a veterinarian's office...I could go on and on."
5,My favourite poetry book,I love poetry and I love cats. This book gives me the opportunity to enjoy both. Henry Beard is a wonderful poet and so witty. I share the poems every chance I get. I am delighted to find out that he has written other books and will read as many as I can. I actually like some of his cats' versions of famous poems better than those penned by the original authors.
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I came to this CD purely by accident when I was surfing the net for info on Jared Leto,(since he's co-starring in Colin Farrells next movie ""Alexander"".) and I must say that I was very pleasantly suprised. This album really kicks some major ass!!!! Usually when actors have their own rock-bands, they suck. (Keanu Reeves in Dogstar.) This album is brilliant from beginning to end. There's not one weak song on it. My favorites are ; Edge of the earth, Capricon(a brand new name).Jared Leto is one fine singer and guitarist. He really suprised me. I have to say that this album hasn't left my cd-player since I received it three weeks ago. This album ánd band is definitely here to stay!!!!!!"
3,Decent Music,"Some may enjoy this album a lot but for me I only really enjoyed half of it to the full extent. Its a good cd but some songs just didnt do anything for me. Songs that I love are ""Capricorn"", ""Edge of the Earth"", ""Oblivion"", and ""Fallen"". The rest are ok but nothing I would probably want to hear alone with out being in concession with the rest of the albums tracks. It was a nice listen and a keeper, but nothing groundbreaking. Worth a Listen"
5,Awsome Band! My new FAVE!,"Look, you can read all the other reviews for a breakdown of the tracks.This CD stays in my cd player everywhere, and never gets old. Its just absuloutely great music to sing along to and get into. There are no bad tracks on the CD. I'm eagerly awaiting the next 3stm cd."
2,"$ Millions into recording, NOTHING INTO TALENT","These guys are amazing on recording. Songs like 93 Million Miles, Echelon, and Capricorn are amazing, but if you saw there last tour, your wouldn't be buying this album: You'd be buying recording time with their producer because he can work MIRACLES! I'm so dissapointed in Buddha for Mary, they changed all of the good old parts to be ""PC""..."
1,overated.,my buddy tried to get me into these guys.. i tried.. even seen them live but the cd is too repetitive and they are horrible live.stay away from this.
4,"Not as good as their new album, but still awesome","First off, I'm not Sherry Oda. I'm her 14 year old son, writing this review.I became a 30STM fan when a friend of mine sent me ""Fallen."" I instantly fell in love with the song and I decided that I would get the rest of the album. Once I got it, I realised that this band had something to prove. Although not as famous as other bands, their quality is amazing. Good musicians, and good taste.I support this band and I hope that more people will recognize their talent.Recommended songs off of this album: Capricorn (A Brand New Name), Fallen, Oblivion, Echelon, and The Mission.Actually, all of the songs on the album rock, but those are my favourite.By the way, if you like this music, you will love A Beautiful Lie, 30STM's new album. I mean it, I like A Beautiful Lie much more than this album, but either way: they rock!"
4,Pretty Damn Good...,"Just got this a few days ago after hearing the Capricorn single and have to say I am more than happy with the results of the rest of the album. The sound of this band is fresh and interesting and provides a nice counterpoint to all the lackluster Neo-garage rock that has surfaced lately. At least this band is concerned with(and it is an important concern)creating, new and interesting music that will continue to evolve the art form. This is a nice hybrid of heavy rock, electronic atmospherics and emotive song writing. A damn good start, this band certainly shows promise. Who knew Jared Leto was so damn talented?? I took a chance buying this, because so often these days you buy an album based on the strength of a single and you wind up getting burned, but thankfully this album is satisfying and worth a spin. Check it out, also would recommend the new Queen of the Stone Age Cd too, it rocks!!"
3,Acceptable,"I only enjoyed a handful of songs. They had a nice feel to them, but not all of the songs spoke to me."
3,It actually deserves about a 3.8,"30STM is a band with a sound that is sort of experimental and is kind of like listening to a painting being put on a canvas. Good stuff, but don't expect anything to jump out at you and shout ""hit song of the year""."
1,"Man, what is this?","Ok, this album can be judged solely on the song ""Echelon"" alone. Google the lyrics. Seriously. The song is a nonsensical compilation of big words that Jared Leto thought sounded cool together. I don't understand how music like this gets popular."
1,vanitas vanitatum,"Jared Leto vanity project. The band is not good, but not terrible. The music is firmly in 80s revival/EMO. The riffs are hardly original, and Leto has a high caterwal that distracts from otherwise marginal sound writing."
5,The best music I've heard in years,"I heard about 30 Seconds to Mars long before their album was released. I knew that Jared Leto was the lead singer, and him being one of my favorite actors, I became interested. Usually bands with actors in them suck, like Keanu's Dogstar. But 30STM is truly amazing.It's blend of vocals that bring to mind Maynard from A Perfect Circle, synth programming and drumkit, and layered guitar melodies make them truly unique. You really have to listen to the album with headphones on to experience all the sounds that you wouldn't hear otherwise. EVery song is great, but my favorites are ""Mission"", ""Echelon"" and ""Buddha for Mary""I've seen them in concert 3 times, and they are all great people as well as musicians. I strongly recommend this album. It's a must have.Provehito En Altum."
5,"Excelent CD, i love it","I heard a 30 second radio spot on my local station for this cd, it was of capricorn. i had [$$] in hand and decided to buy it, god was it worth it. the cd is smooth and flows well, i am listening to it now. the lyrics and clever, the music is original and non-repetative. a must buy."
4,Tool revisited,"At first glance, one would think '30 Seconds To Mars' is just another Hollywood actors flamboyant dream of being a rock star. Russell Crowe has tried it before, as has Keanu Reeves. Both failed. Yet Jared Leto obviously has had the right inspiration and perception, along with his cohorts, to make a quite elegant and soaring rock LP. With clear linkage to futuristic themes, '30 Seconds...' has infused long drawn guitar riffs with blinding 'Tool'esque vocals, creating almost epic climaxes. Not bad for a first effort."
5,"""Space Rock""","Coming from an avid fan and ECHELON member, this an extremely amazing CD, to say the least. I listen to a variety of music, some of my favorite bands include Tool, Dredg, Opeth, and of course Thirty Seconds to Mars. This band is opening what I believe to be a new frontier in music..my friends and I like to call it ""space rock""...its definitely worth a listen."
4,Watch Out!,"Actor Jared Leto has a band. Don't let the words ""actor"" and ""band"" together discourage you though. This band is actually very good.Their debut album kicks off with their single ""Capricorn [A Brand New Name]"" and sets the perfect mood for the entire CD. From the opening riff that hums like a starting engine to the final chord struck in ""Year Zero"", this album is a wild ride of rock.Highlight songs to pay attention for are ""Capricorn"", ""Buddha For Mary"", the fabled ""End Of The Beginning"", and the song ""Echelon"", where the 30STM street team got their name.I first saw 30STM at a concert in Houston. They blew me away; they were the pride of the secondary stage. I got the honor of meeting them after their set and even got an autographed sampler disc. Whenever this album hit stores, I ran out to buy it. I suggest you do the same. Believe me, if you are a fan to alternative/rock music, go and get this CD.It will not disappoint you."
5,30 seconds to mars,"30 Seconds to Mars combines thoughtful lyrics with a unique, emotional-yet-broodingly-dark rock sound to produce a distinctive album. In an era where mindless rock groups are taking over mindless pop artists, 30 StM provides us with a reminder of what music used to be about and hope for its future. The album plays with different sounds and effects that create a diverse sounding, interesting listen; you won't get bored listening to this album. It's an album that is a refreshing blend of creativity and insight."
5,Amazing CD,"i bought this CD after hearing 30 Seconds to Mars in concert 6 months ago, and they don't disappoint. The band puts on an excellent live show, and captures their energy very well. The songs are well written, the music was artfully crafted, and the finished product will have you humming the songs after your first listen, and you'll want to listen to the CD as much as you can so you can learn the lyrics, and learn more about the band. All in all, and amazing CD, and a very good buy. Well worth your money."
4,3 cheers for 30 seconds,"I was visiting in California this summer and heard them all over the radio so when I got home to Florida I purchased this CD to listen to the whole things and not just a couple songs. I must say I was not disappointed at all. The band is great, their editing and producing sounds superb. The only complaint I have is although the songs individually are really good the total theme of them about space and the universe is a little annoying, but dont let that deter one from buying this CD. If you are looking for a for a solid, up and coming Rock Band with a new edge, Buy It."
3,Not Quite There.,"Disclaimer: This album reminds me nothing of Tool. Whoever made that claim needs to have their hearing checked.On one hand, knowing that this is Jared Leto, this album is impressive.But aside from that, there is nothing special about this album. The lyrics themselves are shallow and basic, with *decent* vocals. Aside from ""Capricorn"", I can't find another song on this album that I can listen to as a whole without the lyrics ruining it for me. The album get's 3 stars from me, because the ability of the musician's themselves is surprising, but mismatched in comparison with the lyrics."
4,"Hey, an actor that actually write good music!","Impressive debut from Jared Leto. For those who think this is a band effort, read the album credits. Nearly every instrument is played by Jared, with drums by Shannon Leto (sort of like Billy Corgan's recording techniques with the Smashing Pumpkins). Getting the opening spot on Incubus' tour should help propel this CD to a level where more people get to hear it. Maybe more bands like this would keep all the boring nu-metal off of the radio."
4,Original New Band!,"30 Seconds to Mars is good, very good. In fact the only bad thing I could say about them, is that their lyrics sometimes could use some work. ""Had a thing for astronaughts"" just dosen't have that ring to it. But, the sound is awsome, and on a scale of one to ten for originality I would give them a ten. The album is definately worth buying and I look forward to their next album."
4,Kick ass,"30 Seconds to Mars' debut CD is one of the best I have heard in a long time, they mix awesome guitar with great special effects, which makes for a good mix with Jared's voice, I urge you all to get the CD it will for sure become one of your favorites!!"
4,not too shabby,"usually I don't go for the whole, I'm an actor I an sing too, deal. but Leto pulls it off rather well. I enjoy 30 secs. because unlike Deadsy (a totally ""bad"" band) these guys aren't trying to shock and devour others. Deadsy is just a band for the Korn people. I like Korn, but i am annoyed by deadsy.Give 30 secs a chance. You won't be disapponited."
5,Taking over Radio Stations,"Imagine, interesting new trends from Hollywood. This CD is strangely familiar as well as hauntingly disconcerting in its strangeness. There's a lot going on here. Deep secrets about the band, the band members, the relationships between a whole new breed of Hollywood kids who think they have a better plan... I sure hope they do, because the planet needs a better plan. If their music is any indication of the elation, ambition and yes, pretention of this band and its interconnections to other celebrity progeny, then we're in for a rough ride. This CD hasn't left my player since I got it...How I heard about it? One of their Ninja Echelon tactical pr team snuck into a turned off local high school radio station and played the CD for a solid 24 hours non-stop before ""the adults"" ever noticed... By then, the entire County had heard the sounds coming through loud and clear. This band could spark a revolution. Powers that be... beware... the fat lady is singing... RC"
5,"If you buy one CD this year, this should be it","This CD rocks. 30STM has been compared to Pink Floyd, but they stand in a spotlight of their own. While ""Capricorn"" gets airplay, the rest of these amazing tunes get neglected on the local stations. Why? I have no idea. But it won't be long before songs like ""Buddha for Mary"", ""Oblivion"", and ""93 Million Miles"" are rockin' the streets, backyards, and the world! If you get the chance to see them in concert, do so. At all costs. And with Jared Leto as the front man and voice of 30STM, you just can't go wrong. This is some of the best cash I ever spent."
3,Ok. Just ok.,"Played some sample tunes and thought it sounded good, so I bought as present for son. Didn't sound as good the next time or two. He doesn't really listen to it much. Neither do I. I guess you have to be more of a fan."
5,love it.,"I'm listening to this album right now as I am typing this review. I first bought the ""A Beautiful Lie"" album, which is very outstanding. I saw they had a previous album ""30 Seconds to Mars,"" I had to buy it. This album is really good."
4,Lots and lots of songs,"This book is jam packed with lots and lots of songs. Most of them are popular guitar standards from several generations and a variety of artists from several genres. Music is transcribed using tableture and standard notation. Songs are written using the real music (this is no ""fake"" book), you'll be learning the songs the way they're meant to be played. If you're an accomplished musician, this is a good book for you. If you're a novice, I'd stay way from this one for now..."
2,Not worth it,"For the amount of songs included, the book lacks recent quality songs. A lot of the songs were of no interest to me and I rarely use the book. The format was reasonable although I am sure it could be improved. If you can't use the Internet to obtain your tabs, perhaps you would like this large, awkward, small-type, book of old songs."
1,Large disappointment,I am a long time user of pinnacle reels. They have been my favorite brand until now. I needed a cheaper reel due to finances of late. I got this one. Made very poorly. Plastic reel spool and drag nut do not impress me. The reel makes a light grinding noise when reeling line. The drag is constantly loosening on its own. The nut holding the reel handle also comes loose constantly. I would return it to the manufacturer but I do not want a replacement for this poorly made reel.
4,Just the basics,"If you are looking for a clear and interesting summary of many key concepts of Biotechnology, this book is for you. The author does a nice job of distilling the important concepts for both the scientist and layman alike. For the scientist, the book provides a nice review of the basics, and for the layman, it explains many difficult principles. At the end of each chapter the author also provides a lively discussion of some interesting practical applications and problems solved by Biotechnology."
1,FIRST AND LAST...,"This is my first and last book by Suzanne Forster. Had heard good things about past books and thought that I would give this one a try.Bizarre characterizations and an absurdly convuluted plot made this book painful to read. It just kept getting worse!If I could give zero stars, I would."
4,I love Quico,"I love Quico, the best character in ""El Chavo del 8"" series and I will never be bored of the series...The nly thing I didn't like about the DVD, it is when a chapter starts or finishes it has a bakcground music that some times interupts the dialog..."
3,Ending features an attack submersible,"Not mentioned in other reviews is the submersible that Cpt. Waldrige has brought on board the Concord at the start of the film, and doesn't reappear until the end as he attempts to redeem himself by saving the ship from capture by the British man'o'war blocking the anchorage.The design appears to be based on the Rotterdam Boat of 1654, though is reminiscent of the Turtle in it's operation.This is just an o.k. action movie, so unless you're a fan of that sailing era, not a must have."
3,story in search of an identity.,"Aegis of Uruk has a number positive aspects to its, the only problem is that they are all thrown together randomly. The series starts out as a witty parody of fantasy stories and RPGs that is really quite humorous. At multiple moments, the video game heritage of the story is fore-fronted with hilarious effect. But then the story gets really serious, deep and almost depressing. It becomes, to an extent, a stereotypical fantasy story - the kind it has been parodying the whole time.and it would be one thing if it were a tale of two halves - one serious one not. but the two are mingled too extensively (though the final four episodes or so are rather serious). It all ends up a little schizophrenic and unsatisfying.in the end, if you like fantasy stories of any stripe, you will enjoy this for the most part. but it isn't anything special."
2,Ugh,"This series is horribly written, the characters are dull and uninteresting, the plot is slow, and the jokes are so juvenile I doubt anyone beyond the age of 7 could possibly find them funny.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first couple of episodes, but MAN does this show get old fast...."
2,Derivative,"A snippet of ""Careless Whispers"", some Pink Floyd sound-alikes, and an embarrassingly saccharine death tribute, make this the DTS CD that just sits on my shelf. Better song writing badly needed here. Pass."
1,He's definitely lost it,"I can't believe anyone likes this album. I grew up with Alan Parsons (Turn of a Friendly card thru Vulture Culture) and always admired him for his ability to break out of the mold and defy convention. This album is trite garbage and sounds like most of the urban adult contemporary junk out there on the Clearchanell stations these days. I was actualy so shocked by the lousiness of this album that I threw it away. Seriously. If you liked Pyramid, Eye in the Sky, Ammonia Avenue and other great albums by this fellow, don't wreck your appreciation of this long gone talent by buying this piece of plastic. 5.1 ? Who cares...it's just 4 more channels of yuck."
5,DTS music to amaze,"I have been an Alan Parson fan for about 20 years. Every album has it,s high points and its low ones . But this album only has highpoints. The biggest high point being the inclusion of DST digital sound. Just like at the movies the album is filled with surround effects. Track one Blue Blue Sky has the vocals comming out of the rear right speaker. While the plane in the instrumental cloudbreak comes diving through the living room as you listen to the music. Having listened to this album in normal stereo I can tell you that it is worth every cent to invest in a DTS decoder. The sound is much clearer. The album as a hole is better than Try Anything Once but still lacks some of the punch of the earlier albums. Still this is a great album and was worth the wait."
5,Excellent - and he hasn't yet reach his peak,"This is Alan's second album away from the 'Project' - Try anything once being the first, but he still maintains that constant excellence. The usual band members are all present, except Eric Woolfson and David Paton, but a welcome back to Eric Stewart (10 c.c.) and Christopher Cross. I would encourage all APP fans to venture onto the realms of this themed album. It's not disappointing."
3,Not the same without Eric,"The album starts strong with a catchy jig, but the rest in not that memorable. Too long in the tooth, I guess. Will keep looking."
4,Music Theme follows the Album Title,The music gets across the idea of flight quite well... I appreciate it as a Parsons Fan. More melodic than some of his abstraction works (like Turn of A Friendly Card for example)
5,If you've got a DTS Decoder and you like Alan Parsons...,"Needless to say, Alan is at the top of his form yet again. His use of leading edge technology has always been impressive, but never like this. Without making it overt, he has managed to mix a wonderous album that truly engulfs you with his unique sound. Trust me on this one, shell out the dollars for a DTS receiver if you don't already have one. 'On Air' will make you glad that you did. You won't be sorry you purchased his latest work to showcase on your new receiver. My only hope is that he recorded his previous works with this type of technology available. I would buy the albums all over again."
4,another classic parsons disk,the thing that i like about all of parsons work is how he manages to incorperate many varied styles of music and give it a touch of his own. the music on this disk soars and swoops and goes to points in space that make us open our minds to possibilities that we might not otherwise look for in ourselves. as a fan of space and airplanes and flight the whole concept made me shiver the first time i heard a cut. how can anyone not hear kennedy's voice from the past and not think about all that we were able to accomplish as a country and as a nation as we ventured out into space. well done alan well done. heres to many more moving images that make us expand our minds. thank you.
3,Icky sticky mess,"I use this product a lot. I love being able to wax at home. But the issue I have with this is that there's no way to keep wax from dripping into the heating area.I think at this point if I want to remove the tin of wax, I have to heat the entire thing up before being able to pull it out.Other than the drippy factor, it works really well. I've never had to worry about it over heating, since usually I turn it on and leave the room until I know the wax is completely warmed through.The pegs on the bottom of it don't balance the thing entirely well, but it doesn't skid around or tip over at all. But if you're unfortunate enough to not have a proper counter and just a stand-alone sink that you place it on, you will risk dumping the entire thing into your sink."
1,Podnieks is Either Biased or Doesn't Know Hockey,"Typical of how bad this book is can be found in Podnieks' decision to exclude the 1980s New York Islanders from his list of hockey's greatest teams. In a sidebar consisting of less than 1/3 of a page, Podnieks says the Islanders just weren't that good. What nonsense! The team won 4 straight Stanley cups, 19 straight play-off series, and beat the vaunted Edmonton Oilers twice in the play-offs during their Stanley Cup run. The Islanders boasted SEVEN Hall of Famers (Potvin, Bossy, Trottier, Smith, Gillies, Arbour and Torrey).If you're looking for a book chronicling hockey's greatest teams, pass on this one and go elsewhere."
2,they are soooo tiny!,I was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong! i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all! So disappointed! I now have to go out n find the normal size cookies. What a waste of money. I also needed 50 but 20 of them were broken. They do not put fragile on the box outside.
1,boring boring boring,"Reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes, I served them with a chinese Christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed, as were my guests. Three sample fortunes are: ""Life is not a struggle. It's a wiggle."" ""Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things."" ""If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work."" These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites. A fortune is: ""Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,"" and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not. What matters is that they state a fortune. ""Beware the dog in the corner house,"" would be fun to get. ""Life is a wiggle"" is boring.The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers. All of that was as I'd hoped. But content counts, in fortune cookies especially."
4,A fortune a day...,"I bought these as a gimmick for a little party I was having at my house, but most of them didn't make it as I found it entertaining reading the fortunes. My only qualm was that a few of the cookies were pretty crushed, but maybe that is to be expected."
4,Historical fiction that's factually fascinating!,"The meticulous historical research that has gone into this thiller is deserving of 5 stars, but the storytelling tends to eventually drag on to its climax... You might find yourself missing chunks of prose in an effort to ""get to the good part!"" Nonetheless, it is a commendable work well worth a read!"
5,Original and Taunt...,"In the summer of 1939 a group of high-level conspirators band together to ensure Germany's victory in the impending war. Their plan is to assassinate England's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth when they arrive for their planned tour in the US, thereby destroying any hope of an American-British alliance. John Bone is the Irish assassin hired to complete the plot. Pursuing him is are a female photographer and London detective, as well as a supporting cast of diverse and likeable characters.THE SECOND ASSASSIN is a thoroughly researched and well-written historical thriller based on actual events. It is brimming with detail, riveting suspense, and real-life figures who lend a degree of authenticity to the storyline. The author painstakingly recreates the pre war era with meticulous detail and panache. Hyde delivers a bone chilling thriller worthy of 10 stars!"
4,Kraftwerk invented the 80s,"Looking back it's hard for people to understand the difference between 1978, 1986 and now. In 1978 when the Man Machine came out, nothing sounded like it. By 1986, everything sounded like it...and to this day some songs still sound like it!This is sheer listenable brilliance!"
5,They hit the mark,"After Trans Europe Express came MM. I suppose one could say this really defined their sound, image and approach. It is very slick compared to other albums up to Computer World (which was their next release) but has a warm sound not really found on any of their albums. The Robots is a perfect Kraftwerk track, with vocoder vocals and electronic themes everywhere. This song also (for me) had the most obvious reference to the Soviets, where a robotic Russian voice says ""I am your worker, I am your slave"". The first real KW pop tune ""The Model"" is here, with vocals sounding a little better than anything before. But pretty well all other vocals are synthesized, which I love. Great album, and this and Autobahn and Computer World are probably their most classic. Electric Cafe is fantastic as well, though it was released in 1986 so is a bit better production and the sounds are different. MM is a classic."
4,The Best Techno,"I believe that Kraftwerk were and are the best techno group. They were one of the first and you can tell by the lack of hip-hop influence in their music.This album is excellent. You must hear the song ""Spacelab"". A must buy for Kraftwerk and techno fans."
5,The Man Machine,"A classic album which inspired The Human League, Ultravox et cetera. An excellent recording for 1978. Metropolis introduces synthetic sounds never heard before. In my opinion The Robots is better on The Mix. The Model is a good song but nowhere near the standard of The Robots or Metropolis. Neon lights presents the best vocals of the group. Rumour has it that the clothes worn by Kraftwerk on the album cover are that of the S.S."
2,"Aw, I really hoped I'd like this one.","I'm afraid that any Kraftwerk record I hear after Radio-Activity is going to be a disappointment. This basically sounds like Computer World and Trans Europe Express; it has that cold, angular sound the group is known for. As is made obvious by the album and song titles, that's the entire point... they aimed well and hit the mark. But if you're looking for some classic electronic music that actually has warmth and soul, Kraftwerk's 1975 album Radio-Activity is the one you want."
3,"Enormously influencial, but now rather dated","Hear me out with this one: I know its an unpopular viewpoint. Its not that this album isn't good: it is. However in the context of modern music I find it over-rated. There's no question that this was a highly important album and that without it we would not have much of the great music we benefit from today. In this respect, the Man-Machine is a 5-star album. However, it terms of pure current listening pleasure, independent of this romanticising, the album scores lower.It's still good, obviously, but due to its date the constraints on technology mean it sounds rather dated and simplistic now, dwarfed by the huge electronica/techno acts of the 90s like Aphex Twin and Underworld. Clearly they would not have existed without Kraftwerk, but they are further down the evolutionary scale, and thus, in a purely detached sense, better to listen to. There are some good pop songs here, notably 'The Model', but it is running out of steam in the modern music scene."
5,"His Home, My Home","Dr. Bedell's poetry is what inspires me to be a proud Louisianian and writer. I am a bit biased since I personally know Dr. Bedell, but his poems really do ""speak"" to me. This book and anything else by Jack Bedell is well worth the buy."
5,This book is one of the greatest influences of my life.,"Jack Bedell's ""At the Bonehouse"" takes me back to a time and place in which i had forgotten. Many of us do not absorb the surroundings captured in his work. I have learned to not take life for granted because it is all beautiful. As a teacher, writer, editor and friend, Jack shares his view of life with us willingly. His work has greatly influenced my own writing in poetry and also fiction. In my eyes Jack Bedell is a mentor and he should be for all other aspiring poet's."
4,RIPPIN SOUNDS,Rippin sounds from a modern set of real gone cats. Rockin tunes that set the boat a roamin baby. Give it a spin for a real nice price. A++++ service and great seller.
2,Water Stops Coming Out,"I brought my 2 mice home today and when they started using the sipper bottle, I noticed them struggling with it a bit. So I tapped on the sipper tip a few times with my finger and no water was coming out. I kept doing it, and still no water came out. I noticed that a bubble had formed inside just above the tube and was not floating to the top, not allowing any water to go down the tube. I had to flick it a bit to get the bubble out, but as soon as they started using it again another bubble would form no water would come out.I've now had to place a small dish of water inside their cage to keep them hydrated. This is very frustrating and its starting to look like I'll have to buy another sipper bottle, hopefully one that works."
1,not so good,Doesn't hold much water... but you can tell that by the description. But it holds less water when your rodents chew through it... nice Idea though
2,Strange Indeed...,"...that Robinson's latest books have become as pedestrian as this one. I found the plot uninspiring at best, and completely devoid of surprises. All in all, one could skip this entry and not miss a thing. As always, Robinson is a good writer, and he's brought Banks to an interesting -- albeit depressing -- psychological place, but one can't help but feel that he and the series are simply treading water at this point. If only the entire book were as brilliant and incisive as the very last line. I'll keep my fingers crossed for the next one."
4,Good Read,Good series by a skillfull writer. I enjoyed the three I have read so far. I will read more titles from this author.
5,Banks is the best,"I'm building a DCI Banks collection. Robinson writes well, and I enjoy the puzzles. Have already recommended to fellow British mystery lovers."
4,Another Expert Outing,"Robinson again proves himself a modern ace. Banks takes some hard hits in this book. It's bleak, without ever being depressing."
4,Strange Book,"Strange Affair by Peter Robinson is the first Inspector Banks novel I've read, and I'm glad to find another mystery series I can follow. In this book, Inspector Banks is searching for his brother who, after leaving a strange message on Banks' answering machine, disappears. Banks initiates a search for his brother, while at the same time, is embroiled in an investigation of the strange murder of a young woman, who is found dead in her car by the side of the road.Banks is single-minded in his pursuit of the truth about what happened to his brother, and Robinson paints him as a somewhat solitary figure who really doesn't understand how his dedication to solving crimes alienates him from other people.I think people who enjoy Elizabeth George's novels would probably like this book. It did leave me with a vaguely unsettled feeling- perhaps because all the personal issues were not neatly wrapped up and tied with a nice little bow, but it was a page turner none the less."
5,This series just,Gets better and better; cannot recommend it too highly. Well delineated characters great story! I have read them all. One of the other reviewers suggested it was like Cornwell's series...I think much better...more depth. Read it!.
1,Terrible,"I have seen film and pictures of this Creature but this D.V.D is trying to make the Chupacabra into something from another world which it is not.The time given to it is only 23 minutes and is very badly presented.Do yourself a favor and buy the Lost Tapes it is much cheaper and deals in fact, this film does not."
2,Lets be honest:,The authors of this book lived in a white world and write that way. There appears to be much information about how the US government felt and acted in the relation to the Sioux but little on how those acts were precieved by the Sioux. According to this book every act by the US was done to help the Sioux. Stealing their land and stealing their food is glossed over. Depriving them of their culture is presented as a way to help them. I noted that only three of four paragraphs were devoted to Crazy Horse while pages and pages were devoted to the works of various white missionaries. This book was written by white racists but it is a great look into the minds of such people.
4,no title,"I have not read it yet but I am out and finding it anywhere I can. I'm a friend of the auther and when I found out she wrote a book, I practicaly flipped! I can't wait to read it! And I believe it, from what I know of her it will be good!PS I know I haven't read it, but every book that has ever caught my attenchon I have liked, that's why I gave it that rating. Plus everyone else gave it a good rating so it must be good. Especialy if it's true (and I fully believe it is)"
3,Sufficient for Children,I've had this dictionary for 17 years now. I apparently have an emotional attachment towards books- including dictionaries. This would serve better for children- it is not very descriptive or complete. It would do well for a primary school child.
2,Bait & Switch,"They claim to have shipped the Opteka 46mm filter kit with a UV, polarizer, and FLD filter. The Opteka filters are claimed to be Designed and made in Japan and multicoated.What they actually shipped was a Bower VFK46C3 which includes a UV, a polarizer, and an ND4 filter. It's made in China, and I can't find any specs on the glass anywhere. No response yet from 47th St Photo. At best, I'm delayed in getting what I ordered. At worst, I'm ripped off."
2,Did not fit right,Product was advertised to fit JVC-HD7. It might fit the 46mm thread but the rim of the filters is then too big to fit the lens hood back on.
5,Fun and colorful,Fun to wear as underwear or for lounging at home. Nice bright pattern that accentutates thighs. Cool and lightweight. Matching T-shirts
4,Great for MIddle School Teachers,"Christ Stevenson is well known for his expertise with this age group. They are a different breed and need careful teaching methods to 'get through', A must for teachers of this year group."
2,clasp broke after one week.,"The bracelet was very nice quality, but after wearing it for only one week the clasp broke and I almost lost it."
2,Returned it prior to actual use,"I received this strap and have decided to return it prior to actually using it. Although it appears well constructed, it is very rigid, wide in the area right at the neck and the inside surface isn't smooth - kind of wrinkled. Seems like it will be uncomfortable. Not well enough padded for the weight of DSLRs. Not worth the risk of not liking it after use for this price."
4,Cirkus,"Do any of us really think that life with a Circus is glamorous? I never could think that and this book certainly puts that to rest, replete with in-fighting and back biting and jealousies and trauma. And since life in mainstream society is also fraught with bullying and all of the above, why would life for those considered ""freaks of nature"", be better or different. Well told I thought and it does depict human emotion well."
3,Only OK,"I have always been fascinated by the circus, so I wanted to like this book at least as much as I did Water for Elephants and Night Circus, but I was fairly disappointed. This was one of the first books I downloaded on my Kindle Fire, and I'm really glad I didn't pay for it. The story was mostly interesting, but the spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors throughout were very distracting to this former English teacher, as well as the odd choices for hyphenating words at the end of lines. However, since I am new to reading on the Kindle, I'm not sure if that was due to the space requirements of the device or if it appeared the same in the hardcover book version. In close, the story was okay, not nearly on the par with the two previously mentioned circus books, but the errors throughout ruined it for me."
5,Great Story,I read this book a couple of years ago and I havent been able to forget about it. It was a great story of two young men who fall in love and find their lives turned around by their situation. I recommend it to anyone looking for something out side the norm!
1,Product cannot be played on US sold DVD players,"While the opera and the performance may be wonderful, I cannot tell because the set of disks I received twice are not playable on US-sold DVD players. Although the Product Details says that the disks are ""All Region"" what was delivered was limited to Regions 2.3.4.5 which exclude the USA."
2,Wrong software format,"The three discs look like CD or DVD, but they are very different. They cannot be played in your car or home television.This is a promotional item. In fact it is a very specialized DEMO item.It can only be played on very limited complex machines that use the software format (dts).As I have been informed these are like huge big stage sound systems for outdoor concerts, similar to Rock Concerts,a sort of audio-visual backdrop, --of fighter airplanes, steam locomotives and giant panoramas.Systems with 28 or more huge speakers.It does have some built-in adaptation called (5 in one)(DTS-HD) which can be used in (5 in one)(DTS-HD) home stereo systems with six speakers situated around the user in a large studio like living room.I simply bought the wrong software for personal use."
3,River view,"The River is Mine: A refreshing splash of foolhardy pioneer derring-do. Based on the diary of one member of the party, we join the band of suicical explorers plunging blindly down uncharted waters with high hopes of succeeding either in making the headlines of history or the obits."
4,good little dehumidifier,This little thing does a fine job for small areas. I put it in a linen closet and there is proof in the water well that it is sucking the humidity out of the air. The metal clip that turns the device on when the well is put in place broke off but I just jammed it back in and it works fine again. It does the job I wanted it to do.
2,Worked decently - then stopped,"This product worked pretty well for its size for the first couple months. Then I put it away for winter and when I took it out again, it wouldn't turn back on."
3,Not as good as I expected.,"Before I bought it, I read the reviews and descriptions, so I had expected it is as quiet and good as other customers experienced. It was very noisy on first few days but now seems getting quiet. As for drying the moisture, it did but not as much as I hoped."
1,Disappointing,"We bought two. One works okay; the other one never worked. We bought at the end of a season, used one once, the other stayed in its original package over the summer, but has never worked since we opened it. The fan barely turns.A good size, but poor construction."
1,Worthless - I do not recommend,"I bought this product to use in my car. I tried it in the car, it eventually killed my battery. I then tried it in a small room in my cellar where the sump pump is, days later it accumulated not even a drop. If asked I would recommend this product."
2,know what you're buying!,"This dehumidifier is about the size of a 2L soda bottle. The amazon info says it will remove 16 ounces of water a day. I have it in a warm, very humid bathroom with a sweating water tank and toilet tank, and it only removes 3 or 4 ounces/day. The packaging it comes in says that it is only for cars, pantries, and kitchen cabinets. I'll probably move it under the kitchen sink where I've got just a short section of sweating pipes. Hopefully it can keep up!The item description also says free ground shipping, but I was charged $4 + change for shipping."
5,The Best Devotional for Kids,"Wow, when I picked this book up in the Christian Book Store I was immediately taken by it. I've always looked for devotionals that would really hold my childrens' interests and this is it! Each day there is a new ""sticky situation"" that a child is in, and it gives multiple choice answers to figure out. Then it tells you where you can find help in the Bible (give a verse) and how to discuss this. The cover itself is hilarious and gets the kids to look inside. I have a 7yr old girl and 10.5 yr old boy and this book is great for both. It will be good for my son until he's at least 12. I also got the first version of this book which is just as good :) These are perfect to do either during breakfast in the morning or during dinner in the evening as a family. We keep them on our kitchen counter along with a Bible. You'll love it :)"
3,"OK, but not Great","I was excited about this devotional because of the interactive, multiple choice aspect that gets kids involved and thinking, but the Scriptures that go with each day are horrible! Most of the time they don't have anything to do with the devotional at all! It is frustrating to have to try and explain to my kids how they relate, when they don't. Maybe the authors objective is to NOT provide a good scripture reference in an attempt to get us digging into the Bible to find one that is! That's all well and good, but it seems like it would be better to leave a reference out altogether if that's the case.I am currently looking for a different devotional that can align the message of the scripture with the devotional message."
4,Enjoying this!,My Son looks forward to reading this at night. He especially loves it when I substitute the characters names in the story with names from people in our circle of family and friends We pair it with the Boy's Devotional and he loves our time reading together. I just think that some of the questions at the end are a little over his head. He is 9.
1,Meh.,"The activities are cool, but the stories leave much to be desired. They don't capture the imagination like I had hoped."
3,This CD Has Some Great Songs On It!!!,"I bought this on vinyl when it first came out. I decided to write a review about it when I saw that their were so few who had already done this before me. When this originally came out I had gone to see them at a free concert in Central Park (NYC). It was a great show and the band even risked their lives playing in a summer storm. The outstanding songs on this CD are Cruisin', St. Charles, and With Your Love. Although the music seems dated...it brings back memories of an era that has all to soon passed us by. Buy it because this CD has some great songs on it!!!"
3,We don't all love Marty!,"There's 'deeper' material on the earlier Starship albums but some of this stuff is just really fun to listen to especially 'Dance with the dragon', 'St Charles' and 'Don't let it rain'. There are layers of voices and instruments that edge towards overproduction but don't actually get there. I use to own this on paper-thin vinyl and the sound was confused and often muddy on the big tracks but this re-issue is fine - I can make out the harmonies now and the rhythm guitar is crisper. Chaquico's guitar is generally fabulous and Slick does two of her best Starship tunes - 'Hot Water' and 'Switchblade'. However, being this is a Jefferson Starship album there must be a downside and the first is Barbata's 'Big City' - it's totally out of place - and the second is Balin's saccharin 'With your love'. It's appalling. Balin is fine in the background but many times when he is featured the Starship dumbs down."
4,"A great, overlooked Jefferson Starship release","there are some great tunes on this release, St. Charles, Song to the Sun, With Your Love, Love, Lovely Love. Overall a very stong release that seems to have missed a lot of the attention it deserves."
3,Weak album with a great hit,"Jefferson Starship / Spitfire: This is a generally weak album with one great hit (""With Your Love""). Apart from that hit, the rest of the album is somtimes hard to sit through. Three Stars"
4,Absolutely fabulous,"This is truly stunning.You feel like a million bucks when you put it on.And then you'll wonder how you lived so long without it.It's classy and comfortable, and new-Lexus shiny.The clasp is a bit smaller than I expected,but it seems secure and I'm a happy customer."
2,An illusion?,"I loved this album when it first came out. However I cannotrecommend the DTS version simply beacause the orignal tracks were recorded very poorly. Although ""Nights in white satin"" sounded awesome over the radio in the 60's, the sonic quality of the basic tracks is poor. The orchestra sounds thin. And all the 5-channel tricks in the world can't rectify that fact.I'm disappointed and I don't think its worth the [money]But you decide which is right - and which is an illussion!"
4,Good-not great-WAIT GREAT,"I just listened to this- I recently began upgradeing some cdS to SACD hybrid- but choose this version mostly because it was about $10 less, after hearing the dark side of the moon oN sacd surrond- this was a bit disappointing- the music sounded great but the vocals are sometimes a bit submerged, I havent heard the SACD version so I cant say that its better- but I caN SAY THAT i BOUGHT DARK SIDE OF THE MOON IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT i HAD GROWN so familiar with it that I rarely listened to it- but the SACD version blew me away- as did the SACD version of blonde on blonde. I can say I still might buy this on SACD since this version leaves much to be desired-(Yes my DVD player does have DTS surround sound so it wasent bad equipment) editt::: guess it was the equipment- I didnt realise you needed a ""special"" player for DVD-A, I recently got one and it is AWESOME, perfect sound."
3,"Nice, but only if you've never made an omelet before!","Mollie Katzen's new Sunlight Cafe is delightful to read and the illustrations are great. Some of her recipes are truly innovative and may yet convert non-breakfast eaters. Mollie Katzen confirms that any food can be good for breakfast. But the recipes are not all easy to prepare in advance or don't seem to store well (like her crunchy millet muffins, frozen and reheated), and some may be daunting to anyone but the most experienced cook. You have to be brave to make babka for breakfast! The real breakfast foods can be found mostly in the ""How To"" sections and in the amusing little stories interwoven in the text. Egg and tomato tartines - delicious! But it also shows that the best treats are not necessarily those planned for and meticulously made in advance. There are easier and similarly delicious and nutritious ones in the Moosewood Classic cookbook."
2,Vegetarian Breakfast Cookbook?,"Seems like it's probably a decent cookbook for what it is. I was disappointed to realize that it is very nearly completely vegetarian (Canadian bacon in the eggs Benedict was the only meat component I could find with a cursory perusal). Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, if that's what you're into. I just would've liked some indication of that in the item description and/or reviews as veggie bacon, smoked tofu and wheat-free pancakes are not my idea of a good time."
4,Charming!,"I already love Mollie Katzen--her lovely artwork and ideas about eating, however unorthodox--always inspire me to try new things. Sometimes these experiments are a crashing failure--but the winners make it all worthwhile! This book in particular has piqued my interest. I have not used the recipes, but I am reading and rereading it. I picked it up partly based on my interest in all of Mollie Katzen's books and partly because I had initially opened it to the page with the recipe for Vanilla Ricotta Muffins. ""Just like Italian Cream Cake""...I can't wait to try it. Her breakfast menu suggestions are also giving me new ideas for making my breakfasts, especially on weekdays, more interesting, healthy, and imbued with ""soulful intention."""
1,oatmeal...NOT!!!,"This product called ""Hot Cereal"" came under Instant Oatmeal but I/we saw absolutely nothing that evenremotely resembled an oat. There was no flavor despite the label and if one is supposed to feast with the eyes first, then I/we must say, without exaggeration, that it looked like pulverized cement mix with no aroma. The taste? Completely absent, defying any description in words. To boot, the shipping fee is greater than the cost of what the manufacturer considers a food."
2,Not very good and overpriced,As a stand alone cereal it is barely edible. It is not really sweet enough and has a texture too much like malt-o-meal for my tastes. Plus you can barely taste any fruit flavoring. I ended up putting it on toast from Julian'a bakery (making a 5 net carb breakfast) and it pleasantly added to the toasts flavor. I will not buy this again. If it were less than 25 cents per package I might consider it if I keep the bread around.
4,Dixie Carb Counters Oatmeal Review,"Oatmeal was very good, but it each package had very little oatmeal in it. Sometimes I would have to use two packets to equal a normal size instant oatmeal packet. Taste was good though, and it made you feel full."
5,Very Good book,This book was all I really needed to pass the SECUR exam. It is very well written and well worth the money.
1,"Book not a ""stand alone""","I used this book, along with my experience and I failed the test. As several have mentioned there are questions about SDM & MC on the exam that are not covered in this book. I have about 6 questions on SDM. Unfortunately I had no real life experience with this.If you use this book, make sure you get other study material! With a score of 860 needed, the SDM questions alone put you very close to failure."
3,"old, outdated, and not terribly good",This guide will not allow you to pass the Cisco tests by its self. The book is only good in conjunction with the latest Cisco Press books.The main problem is that this entire Sybex CCSP series is outdated. Cisco added to their tests and updated their books after these were written. (i am giving them the benefit of the doubt there). These book leave a ton of stuff out. There are also some errors in the questions.Bottom line is that these books do not stand up by themselves.
5,couture Sewing techniques,"Fantastic book, hand sewing techniques being the art in itself. Written in a friendly way, making it possible to achieve a really finished fit and look for the clothes. Details on how to make clothes structurally is something you always wanted to know, and this book gives a profound help. Not as nice layout as in High Fashion Sewing Secrets, which has better print quality, larger font and clearer pictures. Copy I received is even smudgy partly."
3,reference,This book I liked. I am an accompliced dressmaker with tailoring experience. I like this as a reference book and also found some handy tips in it.Lucie Zandstra
2,fuzzy overview of hand sewing and construction,"The book reviews the history of haute couture and explains why haute couture products are so expensive and how you can distinguish hand-sewn haute couture product from ready-to-wear.It also introduces hand-sewing techniques, some construction/pattern making ideas and how to sew some elements of a garment. Drawings illustrate techniques and sewing of some elements, photos give overview of construction of the item.However, such outline makes it a mix of sewing and construction which is hard to read and understand. I would recommend to buy a decent pattern-making book and a good sewing book instead (only thing you might miss is the fabric pattern matching in difficult places i.e. Schiaparelli's Circus jacket)."
4,Not much of illustration,"actually this book is a complete...the flaw is the illustration is not much...and the words are like written all in sub-chapter...it's not like a handbook...i think for sewing books, illustration is important..."
4,Good hand sewing guide,"This book is good for people that want to learn the art of couture hand sewing. I was a bit disappointed that there were not more tips about couture garment construction, especially fitting, and how to create a beautiful garment by ensuring a proper fit. It was all in all very informative, but a few techniques were very common methods that are mentioned in many other basic sewing books. I would recommend this book to home sewers transitioning from machine sewing to couture hand sewing."
4,Good introduction,this is a great introduction for understanding couture designing. It gives a rich historical foundation for haute couture. You never really know the intricacy of what it takes to make a stunning hand sewn garment. My mentor who is a master tailor recommended this book to get my feet wet in this fine art.
2,great pictures but no sewing info,"The pictures if the Haute Couture garments in the book are good. They are wonderful examples of vintage couture, which is what you want to look at when studying Haute Couture. Don't buy this book of you want sewing instruction. The Art of Couture Sewing By Zoya Nudelman is much better if you want to learn Couture sewing not just look at it."
5,Great info for anyone interested in Fashion,"My background is basic alterations and sewing from commercial patterns since I am hard-to-fit, but this book explains what goes into the $10,000 dresses that is missing from the $100 dresses. It also goes into the history behind 'couture', which is very fascinating for the layperson.It covers basic clothes selection for your body type, since what looks good on full-figured but beautiful Queen Latifah would look odd on thin Paris Hilton, even in a size 2. It also describes how most fashions need to be adjusted for variations in the more average figures in order to hang right, but if done right, can hide your figure flaws and make a person look as glamourous as the Movie Stars on Awards night.With all the specialized fitting and sewing techiniques it descibes, the book will at least sure help my $40 clothes items I make look more like professionally sewn $400+ items instead of something made in High School Home-Ec class."
1,shorthand pocket dictionary Isaac Pitman eight thousand words phrases,"This is a very very VERY disappointing book. I have been using Pitman shorthand for last 55 years and this book is NOT Pitman Shorthand. It is also very deceiving because this book says Isaac Pitman Shorthand and inside is just RUBBISH a total waste of my money. I wanted to return it to you but it would have cost me $17 australian dollars and wasnt worth the time and expense. I am sure that many other people who are interested in writing Pitman Shorthand will feel the same way as I do as this book is a SHAM and only fit for the RUBBISH BIN. It is the first book received from you that I have been disappointed with and I have a feeling that this is only the FIRST bad review you will receive from people about this Pitman ShorthandDictionary It needs to be checked by a professional Pitman shorthand at your end and I would be very interested to hear their comments, So no stars here from me.Thank youWin Traub"
4,A Quality Album,"I took a chance on this album--I liked Curious Phantasm and didn't know much else--and was pleasantly surprised. It's definitely one of the best albums I've heard this year.The catchy songs, the layered style that's simultaneously cacophonous and melodious--that was nice to hear, but it wasn't a huge surprise. What makes this album outstanding is how artfully written it is. I feel that when you try to write an album about the different stages of life there's a good chance it will come off boring or trite, but this does not. True Men Like You Men about children among adults, Appalachia about an old man losing his memory, Curious Phantasm looking back on a completed life, and Suburban Sprawl, which wonderfully captures the desperation of a midlife crisis--these are some of the highlights of the album.I'd say take a chance on this album. It's different and it's great."
5,"Passionate but clear, rocking blues-y indescribable","One of those few albums that one listens to more rather than less over the years. Cocker's rough voice is yet clear and sometimes tender as he performs the variously passionate, sad, and fun songs on this album. Listen to the clips and decide for yourself. Me, I'm going to see what else he's got out there."
5,Soul Refresher,"Joe turns in fine performances on each and every track, making this release a soul refresher. Top notch ballads and rockers!"
3,Needs to be improved,"This tool does reduce the amount of sanding dust. However, the lid is too flimsey and my vacuum litterally sucked it into the bucket. I had the air bleed almost all of the way open to reduce the pull of the lid but even the lid on a bucket of drywall compound or kitty litter is heavier than this weak thing. If your building a product used by the construction trades then make it out of construction grade materials and not the cheapest bucket you can find. I will convert an empty 5 gallon paint bucket to replace this one."
4,Magna MT80,This product arrived as promised. This drywall hand sander works as promised. Nice & easy to use it. The only problem is that is was missing the 2ea adaptors. I called the company and they sent it in 5 days.
3,Ok for small jobs.,This system is only good for small jobs or maybe 1 wall. If you need to finish a big job or 4 walls find something else. I only used it for about an hour and realised it would take days longer to get the job done in the basement. Even after adjusting the vacuum control several times the sanding was still quit tough due to the suction. Overall it actually does work and traps 95% of the dust.
1,Save your money,"This unit is a classic example of a good idea with poor execution. The hand unit on this over-priced system has a tendency to vacuum itself onto the wall surface, making smooth sanding impossible and laborious. The water filter is a nifty idea, but cumbersome. A better solution is a standard shop-vac with a drywall filter bag installed and skip the water bucket. This unit also has a tendency to produce a shrill whistle from the rushing air. Bottom line, if you can't afford the Porter Cable unit (I completely understand if you can't), then rent one until some manufacturer comes out with a decent power sander for the DIY market. You'll never be happy about the money spent on the MT800. Might be worth the effort for [$$$]."
1,Dont waste your money,Great idea but the flex hose provided with the unit creates a whistle that requires double hearing protection just to use it. ( even with a low volume shop vac) It greatly reduces the airborne dust but the whistle will drive you nuts. Check out the Marshalltown vacuum sander. Larger hose. A 5 gal bucket w/lid and 10.00 worth of plumbing fittings you can create the same effect for less money and better performance
5,pleased with performance till it broke,"I was extremely pleased with the Sand and Klean Machine because it kept the sheetrock dust under control. This is totally essentual when remodling a house while you are still living in it. However, I was truly disappointed when the handle on the sanding block broke off in my hand. It worked great when I used it on the hallway,the family room,the hall pantry,the hall bath and even the master bath until the handle broke off in my hand while sanding the last wall of the master bathroom. Is it possible to get another one sent to me as soon as possible so that I can finish this room without createing a bunch of air born dust? I am awaiting your response."
1,Should be no stars,"As another review said, this is a good idea ""with poor execution"". I would give it no stars if I could. The unit produces enough suction to allow the sanding head to stick to the wall or even the ceiling. This forces the user to work harder putting more force on the sanding head's handle. Mine broke under use. If you look inside you will see that the handle is attached to the head with just 2 screws, a very weak point, and a design problem. I also had problems with the hoses clogging up with drywall dust. The short hose that sits in the water would almost completly close off, and in the long hose, the dust would build up in all the ribs. After an hour of use, I would have to run water through the hose to clean it out. The situation only got worse if I tried to use it then, the dust would stick to the wet surface. All in all, it added more to the work than it relieved in keeping down the dust."
1,usless as delivered,"I bought this unit and paid for two day shipping to control the dust in a room addition I am doing.I am skim coating and sanding everything. It arrived as expected but when I started the assembly, I discovered that it was missing one of the clamps that held the sanding screen to the sanding head. I immediately called the number on the product sheet and was assured that the part would be FedExed that day. One week later, after not recieving the part, I called again. The vendor once again assured me that it would be FedExed for next day delivery. That was the day before yesterday.I now dread going to the job. Despite other control measures, dust is everywhere, the part is no where to be found. My evaluation of this product is that it is useless as delivered. It is no better than the support you get when you have a problem."
4,Great Tool,"Overall; I'd agree with the majority of reviewers....It's a great tool for the DIY'er, or the small contractor. It does whistle; but only for the first few minutes of use. Once the plaster builds in the rings of the ribbed hose, it settles down. It's nice to have less dust; don't believe the packaging, though; still wear a mask and goggles. :)Good tool; fair price. Glad I bought one to keep around for home improvement and weekend projects!"
4,Good Customer Service,I recently was using the MT800 Sander for a major remodeling job. It was working very nicely until I dropped the sanding head off of a ladder and it broke. I called the 1-800 number to order a replacement and they offered to send me a new one for free. I even told them that it was my fault. That kind of customer service doesn't happen too often.
2,"OMG, the noise level!","What looks like a good idea needs some improvement. The only real issue was the absolutely ear piercing, ultra sonic noise this thing made. I had not expected to be wearing ear plugs and ear phones to work. The instructions address the issue but recommendations on how to control the noise were less that adequate. I believe if a smooth sided hose vice the corrugated hose were used it may lessen the noise. The hand held sanding head was awkward to use as well. On the good side it did collect the dust in the water well enough, but after 15 or 20 min. of use the noise was just too overwhelming. Swapping shop vacuums was of no help. I am accustom to nosy enviroments being in aerospace by trade and a woodworker by hobby, but this was LOUD on a ultrasonic level and it grated on the nerves."
2,Screams Like A Banshee,"I should have heeded the warnings of other reviewers regarding the noise level of this device. It may be very effective at removing the dust, but I just can't deal with the noise. I suffer from tinnitus and when this thing began to scream, I thought I was going into orbit! No thank-you, I'd rather deal with the dust."
1,missing,i purchased this from menards for my work on my retirement homefinaly gor some dry wall up went to use the sand&kleen; but the adaptors were not in the box. guess i will try duck tape!
5,"Useful, Very Good","This was oe of my study references for the MCAT. I recommend this one because it has a lot of useful info that one needs to know for the biology portion of MCAT.Another useful reference is ""The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology:Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations (Topics:Origin of Living Things & Chemistry of Life, Structure and Function of the Cell & Energy Pathways, Reproduction and Heredity, Genetics) Volume 1 by Patrick LeonardiThis last study guide had wonderful questions/explanations that were quite comprehensive for the biology part of the MCAT."
1,"Cute book, but probably won't help you potty train","This is a cute book, especially if you like Sesame Street and Grover. However, the book is essentially useless for potty trainers. The entire book is just Elmo telling people he has to go, he has to go. He doesn't explain that he has to go potty. When he gets home he sits on the potty for one page and his mommy hugs him. This might be nice if you have a bunch of potty training books that can be instructional already, but it doesn't have enough info to help your child potty train."
5,It's about communication!,"When I worked at a daycare center, with toddlers, I read this book regularly as a way of teaching the children to communicate when they had to use the bathroom. Because the book used repitition with the phrase, ""I have to go!"" it was a wonderful way to teach the children what words to use and avoid accidents. I loved the book and plan on reading it to my son over and over again."
3,Read this one on the potty or it will be too late!,"The book has a good message for kids learning to potty -- but it's too long! That's good if you want to keep them sitting long enough to potty, but not so good if you're trying to teach pottying. My nearly 3 year old son wandered off while I was trying to read it to him -- and he likes the Sesame Street crowd."
4,An enlightening way to spend an afternoon!,"I picked this up despite my negative memories of Graham Greene from high school & college reading, and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this book. Although it's not the type of book that you can't put down, it always leaves you glad you picked it up.The story of boring Henry and his ""eccentric"" Aunt Augusta is entertaining and might get you thinking about what a successful life is and how to best spend that journey. All the same, it's a light-hearted novel and not at all suffocating or depressing in the way it teaches the ""lesson."" I checked it out of the library for the first read, but plan to purchase a copy for my next long bus/train/car ride!"
5,An entertaining read with amusing characters.,"I found this to be an enjoyable, easily-read novel with great characters. Aunt Augusta is a marvellous character and it's fun to follow the changes her nephew Henry undergoes as he learns to loosen up from her example. Though it's more a book to read for fun than one that will ""change your life"", it gives pause for thought about living life to its fullest."
1,Read the Quiet American or the Power and the Glory instead,"This is a terribly mundane book. By using a boring middle-aged bank manager as the first person Graham greene successfully reduces travels across two continents to mere tedium. The obvious objective is to present extravagant and improbable adventures through the eyes of an innocent surburbanite and thus make them funny. It doesn't work - the bank manager is immediately accepting of his aunt's eccentricities, the humour is obvious and prohibitively antiquated (I admit it was written some time ago) and the description of the wonderful places they visit terribly superficial. The aunt may have been shocking 50 years ago - but no longer."
4,Entertaining farce worth reading.,"Thoroughly enjoyable light fare. Middle-aged banker runs off with wild old aunt from Europe to South America.Several aspects of this book make it worth while. First of all, it really is funny. Second, the accounts of interactions of the main characters with government and custom agents are really satirically true.Negatives are that the plot and ending are shallow and contrived.All in all, you could find lots worse books to read for amusement."
2,Weird - the movie is actually better than the book,"The movie creates a reason for the relationship, and adds some elements of drama. The book is pretty lame."
2,Prank,"Mr. Adam, a 1947 novel by Pat Frank, was called ""A fat prank by Pat Frank.""Travels with My Aunt is a prank by Graham Greene."
4,a rich collection,"Unlike the other reviewer, I had no problem with most if not all of the selections in this anthology being excerpts from longer works. I found them to be extremely interesting and satisfying ""tastes"" of what very different, talented, and in some cases famous writers have managed to evoke of our neighbor to the south. I really enjoyed almost every one of them, and am inspired in most cases to read the longer works from which they were drawn. I didn't know beforehand that Geoffrey Homes's story was the basis for the famous noir film ""Out of the Past,"" and it was fun to recognize the film almost immediately as I started reading the story."
2,Chopped-up fiction?,"I got this book mainly to read ""Build My Gallows High,"" the novel on which the great film noir _Out of the Past_ is based. Unfortunately, there is only a fifteen-page extract here, and it seems more than a little disjointed.Indeed, that's mainly what this anthology is: short extracts from novels involving people fleeing to Mexico to avoid detection in the US, the UK, etc. Unfortunately these extracts are unsatisfying."
3,Great soundtrack!,"This is one of the best anime series I've seen in years, and the music is way above average. Though I got one defective CD and had to return it for another one, I really enjoy most of the songs on this album."
5,Plextor 16X write... THE WAY TO GO!,This writer is the best one I have purchased so far. The Burn-Proof virtually stops ALL buffer under-runs. I have yet to make a coaster (bad cd) with the burner!! MAJOR KUDOS TO PLEXTOR! Can't wait for the 24X burner to come out!!!!...
5,Excellent. And her descriptions match what you find.,"She not only writes well, but has the ability to desribe her restaurants in a manner which will match what you find when you enter through their doors. A characteristic which isn't always that common among restaurant reviewers. And if you take her advise, when you visit Paris, you should find the quality, atmosphere, and price range you are on the lookout for. She is a truly excellent restaurant reviewer, who has never disappointed me. Whether the restaurant is expensive or inexpensive, if Patricia Wells tells you the quality is high that's what you should find. And I've discovered some extraordinary restaurants through her guides."
3,"Good, but be careful !","I was expecting a conprehensive guide to the best resturantes, something along the line of a better Zagot.. this is not what this book is... there are a dozen or so reviews of different restruants.. so i was disapointed in that aspect.. but the recommendations on the outdoor markets, the food shops, the linen shops, the Kitchen shops, the bread, mustard and on and on,,, was great... worth three times the price.... but not the best if your only looking for places to eat... but I recommend you purchase"
4,A Pre-Paris Reference Guide,"Ms Wells allows you to prepare for a gastronomic trip to Paris.Her essential information regarding types of eateries, locations, speciality foods, terminolgy and ofcourse understanding tipping is highly descriptive and beneficial.Choosing restaurants and food styles are of personal taste and may not reflect that of Ms Wells', but the guidelines established in this book provide many options. One can dine at a numerous amount of bistros listed in this guide and understand their specialities and price ranges effectively.As a person who has travelled to Paris, many restaurant guides are available and recommendations are abundant. I regret not having this book on my last two trips but will definitely visit some of the eateries listed in this book on my next trip."
2,Use Caution,"I agree with the reviewer who describes Ms. Wells as overly generous to certain bistrots, brasseries and cafes, and I would strongly suggest getting a second opinion before choosing one based on her recommendation alone. That said, with respect to high end restaurants (i.e. 1-star+), she's generally dead on."
2,Not what I'd hoped,"I brought this book to Paris along with 4 others, and although had high hopes, I found it frustrating. It didn't provide enough choice within a geographic area, and with respect to our one ""big night"" out, led us to a disastrous, expensive disappointment. Alcazar(p. 51) had miserable service (she had billed it ""exquisite"") and a meal that had to go back. We did much better following Rick Steves' recommendations, and our own noses. If it's the third or fourth book on your list for Paris, as it was for us, save your money and the aggravation of carting the hefty thing around. It's not worth it."
4,Great Insight into Paris,"3/3/03 I Purchased ""The Second Edition"" of The Food Lover's Guide to Paris in May,1990 from a [local] Book store.....It not only gives insight into Paris(customs and costs) ,by Paris's equivalent to our USA zip codes locations(e.g 8th and 9th Arrondissements:location of Arc de Triomphe),but also by food specialty shops with a French/English Food Glossary; and two index alphabetical and food recipe).Patricia Welles's 4th Edition can only enhance a 'true masterpiece"",which I found her 2nd Edition to be. Whether you're traveling or not ,you'll pick up the book just to read or use some of the many recipes in its contents.3/3/02 abj"
4,Good guide for food lovers,"This is the only guide that I brought with me to Paris for my 2 months stay there. Here's what I like about this book:1. The food dictionary on the back! Eventhough I can speak/write/read some French that I don't need to carry regular dictionary around, the food terms sometimes confusing and this book has an excellent section on it.2. The recipes are worth trying. I tried her recipes for madeleine and financiers, both turned out excellent.3. Ms. Wells not only give restaurant guides but also specialty shops, bakery, etc. Some of the recommendations are well secluded from mainstream tourists. A trully excellent find.Here's what I don't like about this book:1. Many of the restaurants featured are expensive, especially for 2 months stay in Paris. I think there's plenty of cheap and reasonably good food that I could find. I used Ms. Well's recommendation for weekends/special occasions.2. I think this book is a bit too heavy/thick to carry around."
5,Well Rounded,"This guide covers all the bases - restaurants, markets, shops (both food and housewares), and food as culture. The book is not organized in a ""list of the best"" fashion. It is organized by subject matter - cafe, bakery, marche', etc. - and then by arrondissement within each category. If you are looking for short and quick rundowns, this book requires more commitment on your part. But for an overall secure sense of food in Paris, this book is correct, insightful, and educational. We are ""food people"", and this book really made our trip enjoyable."
3,Perhaps Too Generous,"Although I find her engaging, I have to admit my experience with Patricia Wells' guide books and recipes has been less than foolproof. Although this book contains a wealth of useful details, in my experience she is far too generous with many mediocre restaurants and I have had several meals I considered downright bad based on this book. Perhaps a part of the problem is that, unlike most restaurant reviewers, Ms. Wells is well-known and well-recognized among Parisian proprietors. She loves them, they love her. As a result, I suspect the service - and in some cases the food - are often a notch or so better for her than for the average patron."
5,Excellent and non-polemical,"This is a fine work that ought to be better known. I read it some years ago when I was a graduate student in Philosophy. It is not technical, but neither is it lacking in depth. Keller reviews the history of science from the Enlightenment onward, showing how it followed an agenda based on the model of human control over nature. She suggests other approaches to research that have proved fruitful. Importantly, she avoids polemics--this is not a book that displays any political bias towards men. Keller's background is in hard science (mathematical biophysics), which lends her a credibility other ""feminist"" philosophers of science may lack."
3,Meh,"I purchased this item based on the raving Amazon reviews, but wasn't that impressed with it.The quality of the production/video made it look like it was made in the 1980s... and, quite frankly, it was boring.It provides a general background on what HAARP is, but doesn't go into the conspiracy theory stuff that has given HAARP the profile it now has. It basically says: Okay so there's this technology and the US government is doing such type of tests with it (innocent blue sky research) - and we don't know what the implications are/will be, all we know is that they are messing with nature and so that must be bad. The End.What about the potential for weather-warfare? The video doesn't mention zapping seismic faults which could cause earthquakes - as demonstrated in lab-scale experiments.I was hoping to show this to some friends to raise awareness... but this is not the doco to do that with. It didn't teach me anything apart from what I had already learnt from YouTube."
1,Supermarket Tabloid Science Run Amok!,"Like many of the books on this subject, it combines the worst of tabloid journalism with conspiracy theorists' wet dreams and the worst of half-baked pseudoscience speculation. Martin Sheen is an excellent actor, and without without any scientific credentials, he is still the most credible person associated with this farce. This topic came up over 20 years ago while I was persuing my MS in Atomspheric Sciences and it's as silly now as it was then. Definitely a good topic for an ""X-Files"" episode."
1,Card-carrying Tinfoil Hat Brigade FUD,"UFOs, Atlantis, anthropogenic global warming. The long-hair alarmists are coming out of the woodwork in droves because the evil ""they"" are on the move again."
3,An old Textbook for Polymer Chemistry,I have been acquainted with this book since 15 years ago.I have taught this book for 8 years in undergraduate courses . It is the only book in polymer chemistry which has nearly all the topics relating to polymer chemistry both for beginners and also for advanced level readers .Even though it is old it has many subjects all together that can not be found in another book .I think such topics as engineering subjects and kinetics and also molecular weight equations should be explained more to be more understandable to all and this is the main disadvantages of the book .
3,"VERY difficult to read, but worth the effort","This book was a little disappointing for me, because Machen spends about half of the book mentioning and disagreeing with the books written by liberal Christians with wacky ideas about Paul. Machen also has a manner of speech that is often difficult to follow, including long, wordy sentences. I think the meat of the book could have been reduced to a single chapter. I may have more gray hairs on my head after reading this one. If you are caught in a dispute over Jesus vs. Paul, then definitely get this book."
1,Don't buy used products,"When you buy a used item you take the 50/50 chance that what the seller says is true. I bought this item from a private individual. The player eats batteries like termites eats rotten wood. I was using Duracell batteries and the battery indicater shut the system down after only four hours of play. THe batteries were dead, I measured the voltage. Last, the manufacture does not have a product support system for their products."
4,Overall I am well pleased,"Overall I think this is a very good product. I cannot give it 5 becuase there are a few things that bug me.1- Battery life is short.2- It does not hold the mode you are in (so if you are in random and turn it off it does not start in that mode agian, a feature that is hard to find anyway so).3- The case it comes with is useless.4- Anti-shock is so-so. I use it at the Gym and it works great for everything but jogging. I got a gym belt for it and on 40sec anti skip normal audio CD's don't do very well. MP3's do ok. I have to take the belt off and hang it off the tredmill then it is fine.Over all though I am pleased I bought it."
3,Sk--Ski--Ski--Skipssss,"Hey, I do like it. It's looks good. It feels like a quality unit. When it plays it sounds great. BUT MAN IT SKIPS. To be fair, it seems to decide to skip on certain songs only. Looking at everyone else's comments, I can only conclude certain MP3 formats give the Rio decoder trouble.I'd hate to have to re-encode approx. 10% of my library to bandaid this problem. Perhaps the Rio people can PUT THIS ISSUE AT THE TOP OF THEIR LIST on the next code update."
2,Good Concept-poor execution,"I returned the first one two days after purchase when it wouldn't boot up. I used the second one for about 2 1/2 weeks before returning it. The main reason- noisy amp section. It ""thumped"" thru the speakers when the display went off and whined the rest of the time.Pro's: Nice look; display; upgradeable softwareCon's: long boot up time (mp3); awful headphones which plug into dopey remote; noisy amp section; no car kit; consumes batteries like they're corn flakes. Bought the Philips 501 and like it so far. But, I'm not going to be happy until I get a Remote Solutions PJB-100 (20 gig hard drive)."
3,Some fatal flaws,"All in all I really like the player, and it's trying hard to fill a void that Sony has left open for too long. But I must say I have discovered something about it which makes it MUCH less useful to me. In order for the player to recognize and play mp3 files, those files must have the "".mp3"" suffix. I have a huge backlog of backup discs full of mp3's, some appended .mp3, many not. I would have to manually add the .mp3 suffix to all those files, and reburn the discs, just to get the player to recognize my files. Too much work. I'm returning it, and waiting to see if they upgrade the firmware to just see my mp3's."
3,no resume? how fast is the seek forward?,"I was thinkin of getting the rio volt, but I was wondering about a resume function, but then I heard it doesn't have one, then I hear it does in the new firmware. Well if it doesn't have that how fast is the seek forward button, 'cause see I have mp3 files that are 4 hours long each, and I was thinking it would take forever to just hold down the seek forward button unless it is real fast. Some one please let me know thanx"
3,Thanks Boston guy,"Thanks, Boston guy... I liked your in-depth review better :) Your review was good. It's making me think twice about getting a Rio Volt, due to the skipness factor. This is what makes MP3-memory players so advantageous albeit the awful prices we have to pay for the unit, and the extra RAM. Hmm, maybe I'll wait for the TDK Mojo."
1,Deeply Flawed,"It skips when you walk; let alone run. It pauses inbetween mixed songs so listening to dance compilations is a torture. With regular portable disk players playing recorded CDs, I don't see the value of this product."
5,Get one......NOW!!!,"WOW...I have been buying mp3 player after mp3 player over the past year trying to find the one that suits my needs. I believe I found it. I wanted to buy a mp3 cd player for a while now but I wanted to wait till it was perfect, one with the bugs worked out. This player is without a doubt the best one out there. It has all the features you will need and more. I was kind of uncertain of buying after reading a lot of people having skipping problems when they received theirs but it really isn't that bad. It takes a good jolt to make this player skip, and after the first 20 seconds it is impossible to make the player skip because the cd stops spinning to conserve battery and prevent skipping. I want to urge everyone of you people interested in a mp3 player to give this one a try. I have had a rio 500, nomad, rca lyra 128 mb, and now this and it is near perfect."
1,Didn't last a month!!,"I can't see what's the big deal about this project. OK, fine, I probably could handle the skipping and fast battery drainage, but then several events happened (below, in chronological order), forcing me to warn people not to buy this product.1. The hold button suddenly didn't work.2. The remote that came with it suddenly stopped working as well.3.The whole unit stopped playing CDs and couldn't function.Forget about customer support!! Rio would just send you a useless FAQ email.Please, please, please don't buy this!!"
2,Skips More Than My 3-Year-Old Daughter,"I was so hopeful that this unit would be the one...Unfortunately, it's not. I've used several store-bought CDs in this player, and the supposed 40-second skip protection I've set it at is a joke. The minute it's in any position other than horizontal, it's skipping and going silent for long gaps. Also, the start-up seems to take a long time. As for the remote, I find the buttons to be poorly spaced, and the whole thing should be oriented differently for maximum ease of use.I miss my silly Sony Vaio Music Stick with no moving parts..."
4,Tricky Software,"I love the player and all, but I can't figure out how to encode my music into .wma format. I've tried all the help stuff, and nothing has any information. If anyone knows anything about this, could they please write a reply?"
4,Awesome CD player!,"This CD player is the best I have ever bought! The sound is great, the operation is easy, and I love that it can play MP3 CD's! One of my favorite things about it is that it shows you the names of songs on any CD burned in a computer, not just MP3 CD's. I also like the remote you can attach to the head phone cord. My only problem was that my first one was faulty so a called SonicBlue and they sent me a replacement in 4 days. My only other complaint is about the case. It seems to be the worst case design in the world.Pros:-Great sound-Great design-Easy to use-Has a remote-No software to install on your computerCons:-Terrible case-Uncomfortable earbudsAs you can see, the pros heavily outweigh the cons. Enjoy!"
4,A great product but ...,"Everything about the RioVolt is well thought out. The unit is about as small as it could possibly be, the rubber pads on the bottom keep it from sliding either at home or at the gym, the controls are easy to navigate, and the +10 button (which lets you skip forward 10 tracks) is a great idea. The remote control is just the right length--I can keep the unit in my backpack when walking yet still control all of the functions.If you buy this unit, the first thing you'll want to do is upgrade the firmware. This gives the ability to add custom EQ and, more importantly, skip forward or back 10 tracks using the remote.So, why only four stars? The unit doesn't support .mp3's recorded at a 48,000 hz sample rate. I had to re-record pretty much my entire collection before I could use the unit."
5,As good as it gets!,"I just got the Rio Volt as a present and it does live up to the hype. Upgrading the firmware was a snap, all it required was burning a file to the CD and starting the player with the CD inside. This upgrade adds features like resume and the ability to keep the backlight on. Not wanting to take the time with burner software, I just copied about 150 songs onto a CD-RW, and it plays without a hitch, no skipping like I've heard in some reviews. Navigating the CD is a snap, as a function will allow you to browse the CD while it is playing. Granted I take great care when creating my MP3's but the sound is excellent, though I discarded the enclosed headset (I do not care for earbuds). The remote control works well, though it does not have the navigation button. Lastly, it is an elegant looking, with a large display clearly showing the ID3 tag, something few MP3 CD players do. Simply, a player that holds 10X the music most MP3 players hold."
2,"Good news, bad news","The good news... It really does what it is supposed to. It played my MP3 CD-Rs as advertised, it displayed the track info, it is software upgradeable, the batteries last. The bad news... It skips! You cannot put it on your belt and walk. It will drive you crazy. I rigged a strap to carry it by my chest, it was a little better, but not good. I think I am going to have to return this and get a regular CD player. I hate to change CDs, but I hate skips more."
4,a great gadget - the best available,I used this player for about two years. I would highly recommend it. Sound and support is great. The only problam: after using it well for a couple of years it mysteriously died. I am now using the 250 model but I bought the extended warranty.
3,An MP3 player you can love.,"The RioVolt SP100 has probably the same features as the SP90 but has upgraded software and more features . The SP100 is great and gives you great features. One of my favorite features is the equalizer, so you can manage to have the best sound possible for your type of genre. (Sound options include normal, rock, jazz, classical, and ultra bass). Another feature is the mode button and it gives you plenty of repeat options, shuffle, speed scan, etc. Other features include prog., +10 (skips ten songs at a time) and a remote.The only problem with this is that it plays MP3 songs in alphabetical order and to skip through songs, you use the navigator button. Overall, this is a great mp3 player with good features.Pros: Excellent Sound QualityGood skip protection (40 sec for cds, 120 for mp3s)Good featuresPlays MP3s, and blah blah blahCons: Navigator is a painStupid cd case15 hours of battery life (just not enough)"
4,Worked great -- until it died,"Loved it, used it everyday, had only nice things to say about it. Until about the four-month mark, when it just up and died for no apparent reason. Loved it enough that I'll get another one -- and recommend you do the same -- but this time I'll keep the receipt and register it so I can invoke the warranty."
3,"Nice hardware, wretched software and accessories","Although the unit itself is fine, the software bundle and accessories are pathetic. The included MP3 encoder can only rip MP3s at low quality and the CD burning software is very basic. Ahead's Nero would have been nice. It's the best CD burning program on the market and has an optional Fraunhofer MP3 encoder. The accessories are just as bad, with cheap headphones and a cheaper carrying case (unless you like genuine pleather). In the end, you're really paying for the hardware, since the included bundle doesn't add much value."
3,"It works pretty well, but a lotta unpleasant things!","I bought this player about 50 days ago and my first impression was ok. It looked a little too big and heavy but that didnt seem like a problem to me. It plays the music well, and it also shows the title of the songs on the display. Yet, there a few mayor things that really bother me: 1. takes hours till the cd is loaded 2. you can not turn off the player and have it to play the next time where you turned it off 3. battery life is freaking short 4. after u fastforward then the music skips for a while 5. bad headphonesEventhough i have all these bad comments, i think its ok, yet not for that price. Can someone tell me where i could get an upgrade for mine? Please answer!"
3,i really liked it.. until,"It was really neat at first. I liked the large display and such. But, there are a few problems. For one, it doesn't load when i hold it sideways anymore. So 3 or so minutes into the song it ALWAYS skips unless its held level. This is a problem walking around. Also, it can be very quiet. The split LineOut/Headphone jack kills a lot of the signal. I can't even hear the thing at full volume when i walk over the interstate. Not to mention the thing is really big, but i guess that can't be avoided.Basically, its bulky and isn't good for travel. Thats exactly what i wanted it for."
2,Quality Problems,"After a lot of research I bought this unit rather than others from well known electronics brands, with a lot of trust and excitement. Mi RioVolt worked fine for a short while then started showing problems reading burnt CDs it used to play fine. I upgraded the Firmware to latest verion 2.10 and the probles worsened. After many hours of testing all conceivable settings and brand media wasted, (both CD-R and CD-RW) I contacted Tech support to get an answer that my unit was fine (how can they tell ?) and the problem was with the burner. Many hours and tests with burners later, my Rio does not work at all and am waiting for a reply from Rio."
4,Too Expensive...but good.,"I work at EB, and they sell this CD player for 99.99. I actually bought it like 2 weeks ago. Very sweet player. The ability to play MP3's on a CD player is long overdue, and is now just coming into the mainstream."
3,"Wimpy amp, vanishing EQ","When I set the EQ and then turn the volume up past 30, the EQ effect disappears, so that at 40 (full volume), there is no EQ at all; each preset sounds the same. The EQ sounds good from volume 1-29. I drive a variety of headphone types. This player is not loud enough, and the EQ/bassboost disappears when I turn up the volume -- can these problems be fixed in firmware? This ""intelligent"" EQ is totally annoying and makes this unit (in combination with various headphones) produce both too quiet of output and poorly shaped and impossible to control response. I have owned several portable players and this has the weakest output of any."
4,"Best I've seen, but...","What others say (about the RioVolt being the best right now) rings true. It's a good product, reasonably priced with better features than pricier models like the Expanium. The display keeps that fifth star in my pocket, though. It's easily large enough to hold six or seven lines of text, but someone apparently thought it would be cool to waste more than one-third of the display on static, useless graphics that repatedly animate and use up power. It is a neat little thing - for about four seconds. Still, as much as that one feature ... most everything else is good."
3,Great Product; but could use improvements,"I thought the Rio Volt was a great product, however I have some things I'd like to address that could be improved. 1. The case is not good, you can't view the lcd through a leather case without a window 2. The remote is not adequet to go with the features; it could use a lcd on the remote that tells the eq and which song etc. 3. The abbreviations for modes and other things could definately be improved so they can be read easier 4. Whats with the annoying dancing person; whats the point of it; if it is going to be kept in a future release, why not change it so it goes with the music beat or change it to a scope or other visualization Other than that it is the best mp3 player I have seen from the various ones I have used."
4,Great,"Pros: Very good price, features & sound quality.Cons: Headphones are kind of weak..but you can easily upgrade those.Anti Skip is not thaat great.Sort of inconsistant.Riding a bike on NYC paved roads it skips. Sometimes you hit a huuuge pothole and it doesnt skip at all.Sometimes you ride over slight road imperfection and it skips.Central Park OK.On a scale from 1 to 10 (1 being the lowest 10 highest)I give the Anti Skip a: 5.5 - 6.But overall I give the player a 9.If you're on a budget......I highly recommend it."
5,This little baby it' s hot!,"Ok, just don't dear to think more, just buy it, is you best opotunity to have a 100% good pice of technology. imagine I just put a 152 songs in one CD in 10 diferent albuns, and I can browse to find the one that I want, the only 2 things that I see is 1 that is fragil and 2 the [rotten] software that comes with it, that actually you do not need"
1,Broke after one month,"Rio Volt broke after one month. We took the Rio Volt on vacation, it worked fine, but when we got home the CD's wouldn't spin. It suffered no abuse whatsoever. I have been trying to get in touch with SonicBlue for 6 weeks, so far no luck. I talked to one individual on the phone, he said they would email me and send a box to return the Rio Volt in. That was three weeks ago. Nothing. Sonic Blue appears to be avoiding us. so for now all I have is a broken mp3 player that cost a fair amount of money."
4,The best value for your money !,"I initially bought a Philips MP3 player and returned it in order to purchased the RioVolt. The RioVolt offers more features and the sound quality is significantly better. The bundled software adds value to this product, however technical support is not available for the included version of Easy CD Creator 4(The only support available are the faq's posted on Roxio's website). I contacted Sonic Blue about this issue and notified them that in order for a customer to obtain technical support for Easy CD creator, you must provide them with a Technical Support ID number and their response is below:Dear Valued Customer,We supply Easy CD creator on our CD as a convenience and technically you do not need to install the software. The Technical Support ID number is only available when you purchase the full version from Roxio. If you are having issues with version 4.03 then please reinstall the version you know that works."
2,Worked great for a while,"Worked great when I first received, but after about 6 weeks it just stoped working. Phone support was either nonexistent or expensive. Online support, which they recommended, resulted in NO RESPONSE.I Have given up on this expensive mistake.Bought another brand.Won't buy a RIO/Sonic Blue product again."
1,Dont Buy this product at Amozon,"To me this product looks great and I've ordered it, but dont make the same mistake I made, order it elsewhere. I placed my order on March 6th and it was delayed fivetimes already and it is estimated to get to my house on March 19th if it doesn't get delayed agian. So if you want to buy it go somewhere else. Its also not my mistake becouse I paid for 2nd day delivory, and the player still hasn't even been shiped. So Buy it, Just Buy it Elsewhere"
1,I would rather wait before buying this player,"I just brought this player today and i feel it's really [bad].1) the headphone is extremely [bad]. [....] 2) the control is poorly design. 3) the cd bag is the worse type. 4) the LCD 's text looks bad. 5) the sound quality is not very good, may be it's the problem with the headphone.I would strongly recommand go look for other MP3 cd player. I personally really dont have confidence with diamond's product. from it's video card product history can tell."
2,playing CDs,"You need a CD burner, you have way more music on one CD than you can possibly manage, and you need to burn a new CD everytime you grab that awesome new tune. Sorry, I wouldn't pay this much for this thing... even though I love my mp3s. I have the RIO Pmp300, and even though the memory is small this is excessive and is cumbersome. Sorry, but buy something else."
2,Bad ESP or Bad Customer Support?,"I was so excited about this product and tested it out on a hike. To my dismay, the unit would not work unless I held it horizontal. (So, why have a belt holder?) I wrote Diamond, and they replied that the behavior was normal and ""There is currently no way around this."" It took customer support 3 days to get back to me with that. (A time frame Diamond also considers normal.) So either I have a bad unit or am just dealing with bad customer support. Either way, I recommend interested consumers wait until some of the quirks are worked out."
3,"Good Sound, But Batteries Don't Last","I've had the RioVolt MP3-CD player for 2 months. I like the idea of having a CD player that can play MP3 songs as well. The RioVolt MP3-CD player produces good sound, but the batteries don't last long. It can't finish playing a CD of 122 MP3 songs with two fresh Duracell batteries. Upgrading the fireware does not help."
5,RIO Volt: Sounds Great and Easy to Use,"This RIO Volt CD MP3 is great. I can fit 12+ albums on one CD. It was easy to learn how to navigate thru directories and files. The Song title scrolls across the display. The sound is great. It has an equalizer with setting such as rock, jazz, classical Bass. I take the RIO Volt on the subway and leave my bulky CD wallet at home. If you are looking for an affordable digital music solution, this is it. You can get CD-Rs for .50 and burn CDs with whatever music you feel like listening to and [throw] them when you get bored with them."
3,The best so far as I know....,"I got my Rio Volt a month ago and was about to take it back. The player was resetting its self over and over again after I up- graded to firmware 2.00. I think I may have used the Mac upgrade...I upgraded it with the Windows version and it has not given me any more problems...The sound is great but has poor anti shock support and It cost too much as well. I like the idea of this player playing WMA files. It could have came with a car kit, but didnt. It seems flimsy as well....again I think it may be one of the best out there that plays mp3s and the only one I know of that plays WMA files. TDK has one that has 8 Min of anti shock, no WMA support. I think it will be a major player in the future, but no firmware upgrade... Jim"
3,Rio Volt,This is a very cool product. The only problems that I have noticed with it are that it has a very short battery life useing regular audio CD's. The other problem is that not all the software it comes with is Mac compatible. For example the CD burning software.
4,Not design for running,"This is a good CD/MP3 player but even with the 120 sec anti-skip feature it still skips. If you are planning to use it for running, you'll get frustrated by having to stop your run so that the CD will resume play."
1,Would not work for CD-Rs that PC tested OK,"Big expectations, poor results. The unit played audio CDs just fine (so it was working) and I was able to upgrade successfully to the 2.0 software. BUT it would not reliably play any MP3 CD-R I put in the unit (CD-Rs that worked just fine in multiple PCs / multiple CD-ROM drives).If there are more than 255 tracks it gets totally confused. I wasted several CD-Rs - burning them with 1, 10, 100 tracks - no luck. The unit would crash and reset continually.Had to return the unit - first return to eBay. Recommendation - try in a store before you buy."
4,Minor details keeps this item short of 5 stars,"This is definitely a great portable CD player. It supports Mp3-encoded CD-R's and CD-RW's but is somewhat slow, when loading. It has great sound quality, the buttons are easy to use, and the remote control is pretty neat. A downside is the headphones, so use your own, if you have a good pair. I would also have preferred an LCD display on the remote control to see what I'm actually doing when the Cd player is inside it's case or somewhere else. Otherwise, this player is all that you could ask for, better than that Memorex, which I actually considered buying, before I went and bought the RIOvolt. So, please, don't buy any other item, the RIOvolt is the best, believe me. Don't waste your money on something else."
2,Works well ... if you are experiencing rigor mortis,"I was initally pleased with this product after I unpacked it and tried it out. Unfortunately, like others that have written reviews, that all changed after I tried to take it for a walk.The skip protection on this unit is totally useless. Unless you are standing almost completely still, it skips like crazy. I don't know how this company can claim it has 120 seconds of anti-skip memory. I can make it skip in a much shorter period even after being completely still for minutes before. Maybe you get 120 seconds if you encode at 8 kbps?I can't recommend this product for mobile usage. Isn't that what a portable is for?"
2,Great Player - Terrible Support,"I was loving my new Rio Volt player for about a month. The new version 2.0 firmware upgrade was great. I would have given it 5 stars about 3 weeks ago. It even plays those 16kbs audio books that other players wont - even though the volume is a bit low. But if it breaks, you are out of luck. I sent an email to their customer support over 2 weeks ago, and 2 more emails since then, and have still gotten no reply (except the automatic ""We received your email and will get back to you within several business days"" message). It would be very easy to fix if I could just get a replacement part. So, if you get one, be gentle with it. It's the best player available but has 0 customer support behind it."
4,Pretty darned close to perfect,"I bought the Rio Volt for a road trip, and as an inexpensive .mp3 addon to my home stereo system.If you buy one, go get the firmware update from ...as soon as you open the box. The unit is wonky as heck with 1.0 firmware, and solid+reliable with 2.0+ firmware.Plusses: Lightweight, effective, versatile, awesome sound quality. Overall a good value for dollars spent.Negatives: Cheap feeling, battery door flies open, sub-optimal navigation between folders.Oh, and I HATE the little dancing people on the bottom of the display. If they could not save us some screen real estate for better title listings, why not include an option to turn the goofy little people off?In short, I did my research before buying the Volt, and it looks liek the best game in town right now. If they enhance the build quality, the Volt will be a show-stopper."
2,"It's good, depending on how you use it","I bought this product a while ago because im the type of person who doesnt like to carry a lot of cds with me and I thought this was a great idea. At first it was great, the idea of having 150+ songs on was cd was great. Altough there are people who say the anti-skip works, it really doesnt. I used it when I walked or when i rode my bike, but it skipped a lot. I know about the buffer thing, your suppose to wait a while so that the songs starts playing again, but it doesnt solve the problem, it still skips. In my opinion, get this produclt ONLY if you are the type of person who is gonna have it somewhere where its still, if you walk or jog, look for a different product."
2,"Nice features, but its not durable","The SP100 has good features, and works pretty well but it not built very sturdy. While inside my padded case logic cd-carrier it fell down and broke. I have read other reviews where the same experience has happened to many other people. I just bought the Sony CD-MP3 player and it is a lot better, much more durable, and much better skip protection."
5,THEY FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT,"After reading a review for the new RioVolt player, and finding a great deal (...), I hesitantly took the plunge and bought it. What a great decision! The quality and flexibility of this player is light-years ahead of those first slapped-together units. The sound is smooth and very CD-like at just about any bitrate (I have recorded and played CDs at bitrates from 128-320, as well as Variable Bit Rate recordings), and the ability to read ID2/3 tags makes navigating through several hundred tracks much easier, and dare I say - fun? I currently am using it as a substitute for a CD changer in my home system, so it's portability and shock resistance have yet to be tested. An upcoming trip to the Northeast will tell the tale. But if it works as well in the car as it does in my home system, I will consider this to be one of the best buys in portable music. And with prices continuing to fall, I may just go ahead and purchase a spare!!"
3,"A Little Misleading,but still funny","I enjoyed this show when it was on in the early 90's. And it was still funnyafter all these years later. However for a ""Best of"" I was annoyed to find thatall of the episodes are from season two only. The show was on for five seasons.If your a fan of the show, get the season sets. I'd give it a five star ratingif not for the misleading title. Good likable cast with little morality playsfor plots and then something crazy funny happens to put a smile on your face."
2,Disappointing...,"Despite others raving about this book, I wasn't really crazy about it. The premise - a young woman struggling to find her place in a world with a beautiful younger sister and a father who won't let her pursue her true longing - is interesting, but somehow, I just couldn't become emotionally invested in the characters. At the end, I felt like my time would have been better spent reading something else."
5,"An exciting, gripping tale, perfect for golden summer nights","When sixteen-year-old Jessie Locke's little nine-year-old brother, Scotty dies after drowning in a pool, her RCMP father Rick moves her and her mother, Jeannie to Double Oak Ranch.But all's not well. Jeannie is coping with grief and depression at the loss of her son, Rick tries to turn the ranch into a successful business and Jessie tries to help her emotional mother who is convinced she's seeing the ghost of her dead son.This story is really exciting and mysterious as Jessie uncovers the secret of the tombstone on the hills and about her mother's ghost."
3,Easy reading,"Written in the nice easy flowing style of the 1950's crime stories. Not great on plot or characters. Just sit back relax, read and enjoy."
4,Sex,The original novel about wifeswapping at the onset of the sexual revolution. Entertaining and erotic.
1,I didn't like it.,"This book is the reason I've read only one John Updike novel. I was so disgusted by the people, the plot, and the very boring and unrelated technical passages that I never read another Updike. I thought the characters were completely unrealistic."
4,Great Book!,"This book is great! 1 Long and difficult, but Updikes writing style is amazing and potrays lots of detailed sex between the protagonist Piet and all of his love affairs... many of the characters are relatable, andif you have ever lived in suburbia, you will relate with the fakeness that surrounds everyone. Also, even though I had to read this book for a class, I did thouiroughly enjoy it."
2,Likeable; But not so Readable,"Based upon seeing John Updike in a Charlie Rose interview and never had read his books, I was impressed with his likable personality and wit. So I decided to read some of his much acclaimed novels. I started with The Witches of Eastwick and its sequel. I was not impressed. I was surprised however of how good a job Hollywood did with the movie based on this novel. It was funny and fast moving, unlike the novel.I then started thinking, maybe I misjudged this author, so I read Couples. Nope, it was the same slow moving story line the Witches twosome suffered from. Why pages and pages of narrative are required to describe each characters thoughts and personality is beyond my humble thinking.Oh well...I guess millions can't be wrong. You'll just have to read his novels and make a judgment for yourself.Just not for me....Virg in Austin, Tx."
4,Great book but poor quality digital edition,"This is a great book by Updike, delving into the emotions and personalities of a group of married couples in JFK era New England. Like most great literature, the subject is timeless, and deserves the attention of a new reading generation, as well as a re-read from those readers who remember when it was considered shocking and edgy. It still is. I wanted to read this on my Kindle, but I gave the item 4 stars because the digital reproduction is poor. Sentences are often repeated, and sometimes left out. The book is so good, I suffered through it anyway. Hope Amazon corrects this, because this book shouldn't be missed."
4,A love story like no other...,I've read this novel maybe half a dozen times over the years. the story follows the marriages and affairs of several couples through a few turbulent years of the 1960's. The story draws you into the characters whose lies and deceipts make most of them eminently unlikeable. All of them live in a state of pradoxical moral ambiguity. but still their stories are gripping and tragic. updike breathes life and humanity into the characters while showing us how ugly they van be. as in life in love you must be careful wht you wish for and scheme for. its classic updike and should not be missed.
1,Bad service,"The company shipped me the wrong edition of the book. I had already ordered it late using Amazon Prime and now I won't be able to get the correct one by Christmas. I understand that errors happen, but this is particularly inconvenient for me."
4,New Century Handbook 5th Edition,"Cheaper than buying the 4th Edition at my college, and will be available to sale back when my school shifts next semester. Saved a little money buying here compared to my school's tax free and 5% discount book store."
3,Not really needed,"I think that the book is great if you have not been in school for quite some time. The book is full of interesting exercises that go along with what you are trying to learn. If you have been in college recently, then it is just a lot of repetition.Thanks,SGK"
2,Did not come with the CD,This book was required for an English Class. The required book list said it would come with a CD. It did not.It was less expensive than the school book store.
3,Handbook review,"Typical handbook, pretty clear on directions, but I wouldn't have bought this copy if it weren't required for one of my classes. (Unfortunately, it was.) Good book...just not my favorite English handbook I've used."
2,The New Century Handbook w/ CompLab NEW with E-Code Card,"The book was just fine, however when trying to trade it in I have found because of its ISBNnumber it is only worth $7.00. I paid $70.00+ for this book (purchased at amazon), it is the same book that is being traded in for $30.00(by amazon) but only because the the ISBN number is different will not fix the correct price. I believe this is bad business and buyer beware you may not get what is deserved when selling or trading your books back after you are finished with them."
1,Book not addressed as requested.,"I ordered this book for my son, who is away at college trying to not pay the bookstore prices. This book was a savings for us. But I requested the book be delivered to my son's school address and I listed his personal mail box number as part of the shipping address. Well, that part (his personal mail box number) never made it on the ups label and the package was delivered to the school, but because his personal box was not listed the book is considered undeliverable. I will hope that if the book is return that my money will be refunded? And thanks to this mishap, my son doesn't have his book for his class."
1,BEWARE of buying this from Amazon.com,"I bought this for my husband last Valentine's Day from Amazon.com. They sent me the wrong model 3 different times and when I finally found a phone number to call them they told me that the information and picture on the website was incorrect and that they were actually selling the K205M Model (Not Plus) which sits on the ground, Has no wheels or handle and it has only 2 attachments. I sent them ALL back and refuse to buy TOOLS from Amazon since. Needless to say I ended up buying the real K205M Plus from ... [another store] and I ended up paying less anyway!"
4,Block entertains.,"From the start Block tells stories that entertain, are mind twisters or just plain blow you away. Many of these short stories have a twist in the final line or paragraph that make you ask, ""How did I miss that ?"" or ""Why didn't I see that comming ?""Very entertaining and just right for eposodic reading when you have short times to read when waiting for your daily appointments or meetings.I am enjoying these stories thoroughly."
1,(I wish I had) enough rope,"The first four stories of Enough Rope were bad enough for me never to buy a book written by Mr. Block again. His writing is pedestrian and he clumsily tries to spice it up by throwing in polysyllabic words. Finally, I began picking stories at random to see whether there would be any improvement. It was an utter waste of time."
5,I loved this book because it was exciting!,"This book kicks because it was exciting and had me on the edge of my seat. Harry Potter is an adventurous kind of guy, and Ginny, Ron and Hermione rock."
4,good book,I enjoyed this book very much. Yes its better than the movie. Much more details than the movie. Even an adult will enjoy the story.
3,Chamber of secrets,"I love, love the later Harry Potter books. The first was okay, but this one just didn't click with me. It's my least favorite and I stopped reading it a few times. I'm glad I powered through the blek blek blek to get to the better later books."
3,3 points for being engaging...,"..2 points short of being memorable...The return to the magical world of Harry Potter starts with Harry meeting a rather unusual creature from the magic world--in Harry's Muggle world! This leads to Harry being spirited away by the Weasley twins and Ron...in a flying car. Harry stays with the Weasleys until the second year at Hogwarts begins--giving Harry his first experience of a real family. The classes, Quidditch matches, and fun escapades continue at Hogwarts, written so warmly and enticingly that it seems sloop real. All the favorite characters are back, of course, be they human or owl or Hagrid :) There's also a new teacher, one so pompous and annoying that you'll want to punch him! But the main plot is oh so predictable and only gets exciting at the end. However...for getting more of the magical world you love, ""hanging with"" the characters who are friends (and enemies) read this."
4,This is a great book a great seqeul to the orginal,Theres a few new characters along the way alot ofnice suprises. Moments when you just want to yell at thecharacters noooooo!I love this book
4,...,A very good book. Craig fore the hole family. Must give it a high rating for the Harry potter series.
5,Finally read the book.,"I've only been introduced to Harry Potter through the movies. Finally decided to break down and read the book. Even though, I'm well above the age group, the book was fantastic."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!,"After reading and loving the first Harry Potter book, I was very happy when the second was released. The very second I got the book, I ran up to my room to read it. I finished it the same day. Even more exciting then the first. And just as creative. I can't wait untill all the other books come out. This is one of my all time favorite books!!!"
2,"Wait for the paperback, get the other 2 in hardcover","The first book (Sorcerer's Stone) was absolutely phenomenal, and the third book (Prisoner of Azkaban) was terrific. This one is more like an overpriced Goosebumps book published in hardcover, and is considerably darker than the other two. All of the adults that I've gotten hooked on this series liked the first and third as well, and thought Chamber of Secrets was too dark and not as enjoyable. I've found that more children than adults are reading this series, as the 200+ pages may be an intimidating length for many children. I *HIGHLY* recommend the other two books, and suggest picking up the paperback for this one!"
2,This book isn't that great.,I do not understand the hype about this book! It is not half as good as the Deryni Chronicles by Katherine Kurtz! Is this just because it is new or something?
5,This is the greatest book in the whole entire muggle world!,This is a cool book! I dont really like reading alot butthis book kept me rading again and again
5,Four Thumbs Up for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"If you're looking for a good book to read, your searches are over. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the book you have been looking for. J.K. Rowling (the author) has an amazing way of combining fiction, fantasy, science fiction, and mystery in one suspensful tale. Now, I, myself, am not a big mystery, fantasy, or science fiction fan, but in this book, I really didn't mind it at all! So go now and BUY THAT BOOK!"
5,Great for All above the age of 9,"Having read the other two books with Harry Potter, I was aware of the caliber of this writer. I was anticipating a good book and was pleased and very happy to find that this one was just as good and interesting as the others. This is one of several author's I recommend to other mothers for their children who like to read Science Fiction. It's great to find books without cursing and someone else's nightmares in them. Keep up the good work."
4,Why I brought this book,"THIS BOOK RUL-not! I like this book because He finds a VERY old chamber(not to give away the whole story, but that is the main theme) which was from the time of the first hogwarts term! But why it doesn't rule is he gets in a lot of trouble. But it is a great book."
4,Now I am hooked!,"These books first came to my attention when they were reviewed by a national news magazine.I had to read them and see what it was all about and now I am hooked and anxiously awaiting the next book. If you think that this is just a book for children ,think again it is for all of us who still have a little of peter pan in us and do not want to grow up. It is a wonderful book to read to or with your children or grandchildren but if you do not have acess to children and seeing it through their eyes-do not let this deter you buy the books anyway and enjoy!"
5,Another hit form the U.K.,"I was totally blown away by this addition of the Harry Potter novels. I still hope there are going to be 70, not seven! The plot was thrilling, and the characters all well devloped. I fell in love with little Ginny Weasley at first glance. I know every one of any age will love these books. A definate must read."
3,Repeat,"This story seems to be largely a repeat of the first book. Not enough new information is revealed about the world of HP (although the flying car is just cool). Also, things seems to happen a little too conveniently (like how NO ONE is killed by the Basilisk, all being next to light refracting/reflecting devices of some sort) If you like HP, read it; but don't expect the freshness of the first book. I'm personally more interested in the later books, as they were much more engaging to the reader."
5,harry potter #2,"I thought that harry potter was one of the best books I have ever read! This is a book for any body who can under stant the words. You think the books going to go one way, and it turns the exact opisite way. I have read the all the books and this is my favorite (until I read #4)."
5,A Magical Adventure,It's that time again! He's back and so is trouble. Someone has opened up the chamber of secrets and something is turning Mudbloods (people with one unmagical parent and one magical parent) to stone! Great story and unpredictable ending . Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best books I've ever read! reviewed by David Price.
5,REALLY GOOD!,"Harry Potter is back for more trouble, friends, bravery and magic at his second year at Hogwarts! A very good book with suspence, mystery and amazing magic. you can't put it down! buy it NOW!"
5,a fantastic book,"harry potter and the chamber of secrets is brilliant.I have read both books, and I can't wait for a third one!"
5,This is one of the best books I have ever read!,"A brilliant book, I loved it. Even my sister and brother love it. We talk about it all the time. My brother, who is 4, even made me start playing games with him about it"
5,WONDERFUL,I AM 48 YEARS OLD AND I JUST LOVE THE HARRY POTTER SERIES....I'VE READ THE FIRST AND SECOND OF THE SERIES AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE THIRD BOOK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE BOOKS TO YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE.
3,A magical book,"If you are a person who likes magic and adventure, then this book is for you.Harry is atending his second year at Hogwarts, and as nature would intend he has to save Hogwarts and every one in it again.I think this book is funny at some parts and and a little emotional at the end.I liked this book and I think some one else would love this book."
3,Harry Potter 2: Chamber of Secrets,This is an o.k. book. I really didnt like this book because it dragged on and on. I would recomend the book only to those who want to continue the series. In this book it is Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts and strange things are happening. A house-elf appaer's to harry to tell not to go back because thier is much danger. He said the Chamber of Secrets has been open and a monster is lurking in the school. The students are being petrified and only harry can hear it. Harry is the only one to stop it and fight it to save a student who has been taken down into the chamber. This book is alright but it has alot of action.(This book has 341 pages)
3,The Other Book,"In the second book many different things changed from the first one. I believe that this book is not that interesting as the first, maybe it was because my mum kept on putting the movie over and over. I was able to read the book after I saw the movie and by that time the book wasn't that interesting. This book talks a lot of girl problems. For example Moaning Myrtle, the ghost, who always cries because she was always made fun of when she was alive. Another is Ginny who could never get Harry's attention. In the first and second book the story went almost the same, Harry goes to Hogwarts and faces Voldemort and prevents him to come back to power. The book had some cool stuff but if all the books are going to be the same flow then Rowling books wont be that entertaining. That's all for now."
5,Another Potter Classic!,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Opinion by John Walikainen This book is about a 13-year-old boy who has many incredible adventures inside a school for wizards. I like this book because it has a great mix of action and mystery. It also includes a neat sport that is played on flying broomsticks. This book is a real page-turner with many weird happenings, such as Harry being able to talk to snakes, people getting petrified solid, and a haunted bathroom. It also has an exciting and surprising ending. This book would be good for anyone (of any age) who has an imagination."
5,Great Fun For Everyone,"The Chamber of Secrets is a great read for kids of all ages.My husband and I bought the books to read to our children, and have fallen so in love with the series, that we ourselves are addicted!In the Chamber of Secrets there are so many twists and turns that you feel like you are on an emotional roller coaster. From the start you wish that you could be there to parent Harry yourself. Once he goes to Hogwarts it doesn't get much better for Him either, but once again good triumphs over evil, or does it?I sicerely hope that you enjoy this book as much as I did !"
5,my favourite of Harry Potter series (upto vol.4),"I don't know why, this book is the best that I loved, maybe because of the beautiful concept of an image living in a diary, mesmerising the reader, just as the book had mesmerised me. Or maybe because the author was brilliant in depiciting the maturity of the protagonists, who are one year older now after their first year in the wizard school (and this perfect imaging of gradual maturity with age becomes the norm of the series, one of the most difficult accomplishment of the author). A wonderful book that not only lives upto its expectations, it oulives it. Very rarely a sequel comes out so good, if not better."
5,The best,harry Potter books are the best books ever. I think that you should really read one. I think that the secend book is the best. Harry's secend year at hogwarts is full of danger and comady. So by one one amazon.com the worlds store.
4,"Tome of Secrets: I've come to warn you, sir!","I do not give away the plot, so I will not even begin to detail the story in this, or any other book review.While this installment is a tad better written than the first, J. K. Rowling still exhibits a lack of literary style. Her story is engrossing. It draws you in and wraps around your mind as easily as her latest creature wraps snugly 'round the Slytherin Heir. Fortunately, her style will obviously become more developed with the next few installments, as it has improved a bit with this one.The addition of some supporting characters was lovely. I particularly loved poor, sweet, tragic Dobby. He was an unintentionally treacherous delight.I was delighted with the subtle clues laid throughout this work, the overall dark feeling of danger invoked by the power of her words, the red herrings, and the implications of things to come. This is, as I indicated at the beginning, superior to the first, if only marginally.I anticipate the next work with great relish."
4,Dobby Has Come To Warn You,"The Chamber of Secrets is yet another spell-binding acheivement by J.K. Rowling.This is the second part tell of a set of 7.This novel is a complete mystery and will have you glued till the very last word of the book.Although through repeated readings this does get a little boreing.But this book will have you guessing till the final battle.This book has just as much as the first one SS/PS.It has even more humor,mystery,enchantments, and phenominal,magical creatures.Who is the heir of Slytherin? Could it be the mysterious house-elf Dobby, the sly, cunning, Draco Malfoy, or could it be the one everone suspects, The Famous Harry Potter?!"
5,WOW.,This series of books is great. I hate to read but love to read these. I usually spend atleast 1 month reading other books but only spend 1 or 2 days reading these. I am not going to give any of the book away because it is such a great book and you can't live without it.
4,Great Book!,"Personally this is my least favorite but it doesn't lag far behind. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are going back to Hogwarts for year two of their wizarding training. Plenty of adventures happen to them while they race the heir of Slytherin and try to uncover the secret of the Chamber of Secrets and save the muggles in the school. J.K Rowling captures you into the pages again! Children should READ this book, but you should read the first one before you read this one."
3,the spine was almost broken,"The book itself was good, but I expected to get the book in good condition. Instead the spine was pretty much broken."
5,Amazing!,"This is truly the best book I have ever read. It's thrilling from begining to end and is the best Harry Potter book. It's much better than the first. The first was really kind of boring, but this has action from beginning to end."
4,"Good, but not as good as the first one","I really enjoyed this book, but I have to say that it was slower than the first one. It took me a little longer to read it and it took me longer to get into it.But, by the end of the book, I was engrossed and I really enjoyed the ending.My one strong opinion - make sure you read these books in order. I would have been pretty lost if I had not read Book 1 first."
5,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"This is the 2nd book in the Harry Potter series and I finished it almost in one day. Just to mention how good it was. To the people who have read the first book, either you like it or you hate it. But those who liked it will most certainly read all parts of the series.This time Harry goes back to Hogwards School of witchcraft and faces the secret of the Chamber of Secrets and what's in it. The book is totally written in the same style as the first book. You will learn more about the Wizards and Witches and the history of Howards School. I'm looking forward to the movie. 5 stars."
5,Just READ it!!!,"I was very late to the Harry Potter rush. When I had initially heard about the ""little kids books"" involving Harry Potter, I thought Potter was the author. Only once the movie came out did I start reading the books. I literally couldn't put them down. I read all 4 books in about 3 weeks total. I'm now reading them aloud to my 4 1/2 year old, who of couse doesn't get it all, but loves them anyway.Trust me, these books are absolutely fantastic! As long as you're between the ages of 4 and 114, you will love them!"
4,"Not quite as good as The Sourcer's Stone, but still amazing","I started reading the first book (and...) only 5 days later (...) not only have I bought and read books 2-4, but I have also seen the movie. Nothing has ever hooked me like these books have and I bow down to Rowling for her superb imagination. The Chamber of Secrets was excellant, though not quite as good as the first."
4,harry potter and the chamber of secrets,"This book was good but still not my favorite. It gets exciting at the second half of the book. At Hogwarts, the chamber of secrets was opened and Harry decides to go explore it. Rons sister ginny was tooken to the chamber. When Harry and Ron find Ginny, the book takes a big twist. Read the book to find out what happens."
5,Harry Potter and The Chamber of secrets,I have read the 1st and 2nd Harry Potter books and this one was more better than the first.This book is very intriging and isn't as slow as the first one and has more events.I highly reccomend this book to someone who likes an itriging story and if you read the first.
5,Better than the first!,"This story starts late in the summer at the Dursley's.It is the summerin whichhis second year at Hogwarts. He was stuck up in his room whenhe meets a house elf named Dobby. Dobby warns him not to go back to Hogwarts because if he did, he would be in danger. Unlike the first book, this one doesn't take a long time for the story to get exciting. At the school, there was writing on the wall, saying about openening the Chamber of Secrets, and people were being Petrefied, or being turned into stone.In this story you will meet Ron's little sister Ginny, and how Harry was able to talk to the snake at the zoo in the first book. This is the best book I've ever read, and I think you would like to read it too. If you were a fan of Harry Potter and the Sourcerer's Stone, you will love this one."
4,All ages fun!,"I'm thirty years old, and I love Harry Potter! If you are the type of person who still enjoys a rousing adventure (why are adventures always 'rousing'?), an enticing mystery, or a thrilling fantasy, try this book. Don't be afraid to stop being an adult and for just a little while, let the enchanting J.K. Rowling bring you back to a time when school was both a haven of friendship and pit of dispair. She remembers what it was like to be a kid and she gets it right.The characters in her books are not perfect. They make mistakes and sometimes they can be petty. On the other hand, there is such a feeling of veracity that you get swept up into the story. The Chamber of Secrets is not quite as exciting as The Sorceror's Stone. At least not at the beginning. After a promising beginning, the middle tends to drag, but near the end, be prepared for a roller coaster ride!"
1,What is all the fuss about?,"This and all the Harry Potter books are much overrated both as to their force for ""evil"" and their status as ""great literature"". They are comparable to the ""Hardy Boys"" with some supernatural stuff thrown in. If this book gets your children reading that's great but don't believe they are learning any great moral lessons. There are none. The characters are one dimensional. Harry's foster family is disgusting mean and ugly. Harry himself has more magic tricks than brains. When your children have read these books the next step is not the works of C.S. Lewis. Start them on Grimm's fairy tales."
1,TERRIBLE,"I did not think Rowling could write a worse book than the first Harry Potter. I was wrong. This book, written as though Rowling did not care whether every word was spelled wrong had very bad grammar and word usage worthy of a four year old."
1,Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets,"I wish they wouldn't put an arbitrary reading level on the books. I'm 53 years young and I'm on the third Harry Potter Book. I don't like science Fiction per se, but these Harry Potter books are very enjoyable."
1,words cannot express my feelings for this book....,"I think that this book could have been much better...although I do not care for the Harry Potter series at all. They are really unimaginative and uncreative, and at times, rather silly and dumb. (with all due respect) I think that JK Rowling kinda copied it from the Lord of the Rings series, except she made it for younger kids. The movies are not as exciting as I thought they should be. I would highly recommend reading the Lord of the RIngs series instead. The Harry series is a waste of time."
5,Love,"Will reread again and again !! Even as an adult I enjoy them more each time!!! Harry world is so real, I feel like I'm a kid again!"
5,The best book ever,"I give this book 5 stars. This book makes your imaingation never stop. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is about a boy who goes back to a second year of Hogwarts. He is picked in a house called,""Gryffindor."" He finds a secret place that know one has never gone in. It's called,""The Chamber of Secrets."" I wondered if any body went in the Chamber of Secrets or if Something would take them there. I think it is cool because it has action and magic. If you're bored, tell your mom or dad to go to library the and get this book. I think it would be the best book you have ever read. So go to the library and get this book. Don't miss this book! You got to get it."
5,An awesome book,"When I read this book in the 7th grade, I could not put it down. With the fantasy, adventure, and mystery I might suggest this book. In the book Harry is back at Hogwarts for a second year of wizard training. J.K Rowling, the author, splendidly takes Harry through an action packed year. Then to make things better, peoples sercets will be revealed(hence the title Chamber of sercets). It will take you to new points of your imagination, I guarantee."
4,Excellent follow-up,Brilliant follow-up to Sorcerer's Stone. Harry and his adventures with pals Ron and Hermione as they seek magical education and defeat of the evil Lord Voldemort are as frightful and thrilling as ever. A must read for anyone whom enjoys a truly magical journey.
5,HP CoS Review,"This is an excellent book as is the whole series. I would recommend this to not only children, but adults as well."
5,Hitika's Book Review,"This second Harry Potter book is very interesting and I am sure this review will make kids want to read it. Every page of this book has something new to it, something magical. This book is nothing but fun. This book turns you into a child for sometime. I recommend taking a trip with Harry Potter back to Hogwarts into the chamber of secrets. This book turns you into a child for sometime. I seriously think every child must read this book or any other Harry Potter book."
4,A Wonderful Starting Point,"A wonderful book. You'd think the book is just for kids but there is enough intrigue and fantasy and complexity to keep adults interested as well. Once you get into it you'll have a hard time putting it down. If you have kids, it makes a great bedtime story, and will surely give them dreams to remember, that is, if you can get them to go to bed and let you save some for the next night. It's probably the best book of the series to start reading."
3,good,"At first I thought it was boring, in the beginning. It is about a wizard name Harry Potter, who goes to a school call Hogwarts. He solves the legend that is in Hogwarts. When the Weasely brothers rescue Harry, was my favorite part. I liked the ending because Dobby tried to save him."
5,Chamber of Secrets,"It's the best. The series is the greatest.Mysterious, very interesting too.Harry Potter, Ron Weasely, and HermioneGranger have the best adventures."
5,We used to call him Bobby !,"Many people wouldn't recall Bobby Brewster, maybe I made him up, but if my memory serves me right he was the Harry Potter of 20 or so years ago and I loved him. I know I should have outgrown this stage by now but JK Rowling is a truly excellent writer. Cliche as it may sound I couldn't leave The Chamber of Horrors down (maybe there was a spell on it! ). Its so imaginative, funny and almost believable. The different courses they study - Herbology, The Dark ages, Potions - who would have thought of them. It must have been so difficult to write such an unpredictable book with little twists and turns all over the place. If my 8 year old nephew doesn't hurry up and finish the third one, well suffice to say you can imagine which one of us is the bigger. Please tell me there are plans for a fourth..."
5,I Loved It!,"The Chamber of Secrets was better than the first. And it DOESN'T promote witchcraft. And for all those kids out there who can't read it beacause their parents won't let you, I feel awfuly sorry for you. As for the parents, you need to lighten up a little. I'm eleven years old and belive me, I did not at all feel that the book was promting anything. IT'S JUST A BOOK! Kids aren't going to go out and learn about witchcraft beacause of something they read in a book! And I do not feel like they were going too over the edge with the murdering. What about all that violence and horrorwe see on televistion everyday. That doesn't even compare to the 'violence' and 'horror' in these three books ment for children aged 8-13. I hope you see the light and let your children read the book."
4,Fun to read,"I just finished reading this to my 7 year old. She loved it so much she has started reading it herself for up to 3 hours at a time! The story is adventurous enough to captivate children, and the characters in the school are indentifiable as personalities they may know.My only complaints are that the Muggle family with whom Harry lives goes a little over the top on cruelty. The ending was a bit contrived, more so than her other two books. Furthermore, I feel it was rather unneccessary to turn an annoying character into an evil one.However, it builds nicely on loose ends in the first book and leads into the third rather well. It seems to be the weakest of the three published so far, but the standard characters remain enjoyable and are developed nicely. I would recommend this for most children and a few adults as well."
3,"A well thought out, imaginative book","Although everyone seemed to love this book, and gave five stars, I beg to differ. While the book was well thought out and clearly very imaginative, it is, on the whole, a pure self-indulgence read. I happen to think that a five-star book should change its readers and their ways of looking at the world, and touch its readers deep into the heart. A five-star also feels as a completely different, new book every time one reads it. This book, while thoroughly enjoyable and worth reading, does not do that, and remains, therfore, a fairy tale without much point. However, if one wishes to simply have himself a good, enjoyable, light read, this book is highly recommendable. To sum it up, it is a delightful children's book, good for reading once."
4,Muggles just don't understand,"In the 2nd installment of Rowling's popular series, Harry finds himself back at Hogwarts, despite a houseelf named Dobby and his uncle, who forbids him to visit the school again. Harry thrives again in the familiar walls of Hogwarts, but a mysterious person/thing is attacking the ""mudbloods"" at Hogwarts! When it comes to the possibility of Harry's haven being closed down, he takes action--especially when Hermoine Granger is attacked.I recently reread all the books in the series (well, I'm on the 4th one) and this was the first time I had read the 2nd one in probably 3 or more years, since I lost my first copy. I found it, at times, incredibly boring and it was hard to read every word. Maybe it was because I've seen the movie so many times (although that didn't happen when I read the 1st one), or maybe it was just my preference. Whatever it was, I think that the 1st, 3rd and 4th ones are better.One thing positive..it was hella better than the 5th one!"
5,Come on! It's Harry Potter!!!,"I mean, after all, what's not to love! I usually shy away from reading ""what everyone's reading"", but am I glad I made an exception to pick up the first HP book--and have not stoped reading and rereading them yet! Well written for adults and older shildren alike (I fight with my 11 and 13 year olds for reading rights) its great reading, period!"
1,"I love the series, but they sent cassette tapes","I ordered this several months ago and had it sent to my daughter who lives six hours from me. Her children were reading and listing to the series, and the talents of Jim Dahl as narrator are superb. I have all the books on audio, but the first four are on cassette and I thought it a good time to upgrade to CD since cassette players have become obsolete. I ordered this on CD and it arrived as cassette tapes - she had no way to play them for her family and ended up buying an adaptor for her car because they were ready to listen to that book. I received permission to return, but since I didn't have them in my possession until last month, and very busy schedules for both of us, the time to return them expired. She gave the tapes recently to me but I have no way to use them now, disappointing."
4,Delivered as promised.,The book is in excellent shape and was delivered as promised. I do wish I had known it was not the same size as the other books I ordered because now it looks odd in the set. I don't have a problem with this company and would definitely order from them again.
4,Secrets,Probably the last person in the world to start reading Harry Potter. I liked it a little better than the first one. It's kind of the same again. Harry has a bad time with the Dursleys. He goes to Hogwarts. Something happens. He solves the problem.
5,Wow! I'm so impressed.,"It's a long time for me to get impressed by book, especially by Dumbledore's answer to Harry after the horrible case was solved.(You know what it is?)I think this one is the most exciting of Harry Potter series.Reading each book, I found this series is tight-structured, the story is breathlessly exciting the characters are all vivid.I decide to give my friend who hasn't read this one yet as a christmas gift."
5,Excellent Sequel!,"It's an unusual and wonderful thing when a book as magical as 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' can have a sequel be just as good, if better than itself. 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' defintely live up to its predecessor! JK Rowling is obviously one of the top authors out there right now, if not the best. She is most defintely my favorite author right now! Rowling produces another sweeping magical adventure in this second installment of the hit series. The same wit, humor, description, suspense, and magic is still there. I'm guessing that it will always be there after reading the fourth book and discovering it to be even better than the previous three.The plot is great in this one! I really love how the whole storyline has matured and become darker and more mysterious, generally becoming more fit for teenagers and adults. Children can still enjoy the Harry Potter books, but adults and teenagers will simply love the new maturity in Rowling's writing!"
5,How good this book is?,"Harry Potter and the chamber of secret is the second book of the Harry Potter series. And compare it to the first book, this one is much better. This book described what does a young wizard do in his second year. Harry Potter like the last book also met the Lord Voldmort. But this time it's the memory of the Dark Wizard magically written in a diary. And this book write why is he trying to find out what is the chamber of secret. And then it described how they find it and also in the end how Harry have battle the servant of the Dark Wizand and encounter many dangers. After read this book, I can't wait until I read the next book which is the Harry Potter and the Prizoner from the Azkaban."
5,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was GR8!!,"I read Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets for an English project and it was awesome.This book starts out with Harry living with his Aunt and Uncle untiol Hogwarts is in session. A house-elf named Dobby comes to tell Harry that he shouldnt go back to Hogwarts this year. But Harry has to because he feels that it is his home. Dobby does everything he can to stop Harry from going back he even ruins Harry's aunt and uncles dinner party. Uncle Vernon gets very angry and tells Harry he's forbidden to go back to Hogwarts and locks Harry into his room. Ron, Harry's best friend, comes to save him with his twin brothers Fred and George.... the bell just rung i will cont later"
4,Less than intrigued,"I was very pleased with the creative ideas theauthor used to support the development of her storyline, as she did in the first book. This book hadgood continuity with the first book. I felt that thisbook lacked the creative imagination that the Sorcerer'sStone displayed, and had difficulty completing the book."
4,A great sequel,"In this series, the sequels get progressively better (so far).Often thought of as a kid's book, the Harry Potter series also makes for entertaining light reading for adults. Though voluminous, the books can be read quickly taking only a day or two of focused reading."
5,This is the best book I ever read!,"When people start disappearing from Hogworts School, Harry gets suspicious. He never thought his best friend would disappear. It's up to Harry to save his friend and put an end to the missing students. This is a great story for all readers!"
4,This book is not just for kids.,"Okay, so I am not in junior high. I am a 27 year old mother of three and I am now a fan of Harry Potter. I got into it on the advice of my 40+ year old sister in-law. She gave the books rave reviews. Although I am not yet finished with Book 2 (I still have yet to read Book 1) I am amazed at the fact that does not seem like a children's story. True, it deals with the trials and tribulations of the average preteen, but the way Rowlings writes, she makes you forget that her books were written with children in mind. The plot is as good as any adult thriller in the sense that it keeps you guessing and looking for more. Once I finish with Chamber of Secrets, I will backtrack to read Book 1 and then continue on with the series."
5,Who doesn't love HP?,We needed something to listen to for the whole family on a long trip ti Idaho- this was perfect. Love how J.K. Rowling made a series that even adults enjoy. I especially love her sense of humor.
5,Harry Potter,This is my second fav book in the series! Straight to the point and eerie connections are made between The Dark Lord and Harry.
5,Never gets old!,This is my second time reading the Harry Potter series. Better than the movies! it never gets old! love love love!
4,Always a good read!,"Truely a classic. Although the movie is good, the book is always better. If you grew up in the 90's and read this book, you should give this another read."
5,An awesome book to read,"When I read this book in the 7th grade, I could not put it down. With the fantasy, adventure, and mystery I highly suggest this book. In the book Harry is back at Hogwarts for a second year of wizardry. J.K. Rowling, the author, splendidly takes Harry through an action packed year. What makes this story even better are the secrets that are revealed (hence the title Chamber of Secrets). It will take you to new points of your imagination. I guarantee."
5,Second book better than the first!!,"I read this book back in early 2001 after being hooked on the first of the series. Surprisingly, reading it over and over has turned into a habit as this was a bit darker yet more detailed. I wished they would have put the deaths and other scenes in the actual movie."
5,Harry Potter is awesome!!,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is definitely as good as the first!! I read it in less than eight hours because I was so excited to finally have it!! I loved the way the story was fast-paced all the way from the beginning until the last sentence at the end!! Harry Potter triumphs again!! I definitely recommend this book for people of all ages, even adults who normally don't like fantasy!! This is a wonderful story that I think all people should have a chance to enjoy! Rowling does it again!! I can't wait till October, when 3rd year begins!! Go Harry!!"
1,Harry Potter,"I rated Harry Potter 1 star becuase I did not think it wasn that exciting. Harry Potter was not a realistic book, it was just a made up fantasy. I think an adult might enjoy Harry Potter becuase they could understand it better. However someone my age could not understand many of the things the author states in the book."
1,Review paper for Harry Potter.,I don't like this book because you could not understand whatthe author was trying to say. I don't think kids should read this bookbecause the book is really hard to read. A adult might like it if theycan understand it. Another reason I did not like this it is because there was nothing realistic about it.
1,A sequel cant be disappointing if the first book was just as bad,This book was barley a mystery novel due to the mysterious petrifactions at the very end. Then again comparing it to a magical themed book it would be very much a mystery novel. While you are reading this book you are reminded with subtle hints of its intended audience such as a blushing little girl running away and ending up having to be rescued by the hero that is a little older.
1,If you don't like fantasies you won't like Harry Potter,Hi my name is Kelsey and I did not enjoy Harry Potter at all.I really did not enjoy the book and I don't recommend the book to anyone. The reason I did not enjoy the book is because I am not interested in magic and fantasies. It was hard to understand and hard to read. I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoy other books that I have read. The opinion I have may be very different from yours but I don't think that I would like to read any other Harry Potter books ever again. If you don't like fantasies or imaginative books this is one of those books you won't enjoy.
1,hi,"I feel very sorry for anyone, no matter what age, who thought that this book was hard to read. I was very disappointed in this book, and yeah, maybe it's a kid's book so I shouldn't have gotten it, but with all the hoop and holler about it I thought it must be something special. Not so. This book is just like any old Hardy Boys or Sweet Valley Twins or Lloyd Alexander book I ever read in elementary school to pass the time. There's the little hero who can do no wrong and the loser bad guy who hates him for no reason and is, of course, the latest spawn in a long line of bad guys who were bad for no reason. Even Star Wars is better than this. Okay, so maybe if you are in elementary school it would be an alright read, but even then I can't understand getting THIS excited about it..."
5,Harry Potter did it again!,"This bok is just as good as the first one. It also is filled with suspensful twists, and humorous stories. Right before Harry goes back to Hogwarts, a house-elf named Dobby warns him that terrible things will happen if he returns to school. Excited to get away from the Dursleys for another school year, Harry ignores Dobby and goes back anyway. But soon after he returns people start turning into stone. Harry's worst fear is that he without knowing it, is making this happen. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes good fantasies, but be sure to read the first one."
4,A good story,"Rowling does it again, delivering another classic fantasy tale. She preserves a sense of mystery throughout the book.But I'm annoyed with her trend to make the mysteries of both books 1 & 2 unsolvable. There's no way the reader can figure out some things with the information given.All this aside it's a very entertaining book."
5,Harry Potter's Great,Harry Potter's a really cool book.It's about a wizard.I think it's the best book I ever read.I know you'll like it.It's very amazing.It's a great book.Plese read it.
5,It Can't Get Any Better!,"My two friends and I have read the whole series of Harry Potter and we love it! Especially this one! But, even though we're 11, this isn't just a children's book! Adults can enjoy this stuff too! I think anybody who thinks this is bad stuff and it ""glorifies witchcraft and evil"" is nuts.(no offense to the religious people out there) This book can't get any better! This review comes from Bryan, Robin and Steph, who must be the biggest Harry Potter fans in our class!"
5,The best book in years!,"Harry Potter is such an enchanting hero! My whole family loves the story! Even my brother who won't read can't put it down. We are going to order the third as soon as it comes out. These two books are the best in years, for any age or reader."
3,Kind of Gruesome,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was not as good as any of the other three. It was confusing and gruesome, near the end. I wouldn't NOT read it if you haven't yet, because it's interesting and if you don't read it, you'll miss parts and then parts of the third book won't make sense. It's not as good as the others, but it's interesting, so I would recommend this book."
2,not so good but i made it through,"I liked this book but it was not as good as the 1st, 3rd or 4th but it was ok. I thought that you might not like a book in a series but you should read it so the other books make sense.so I recomend this book to all of you reading this not because it is super good but because books 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7(when 5, 6 and 7 come out)will make more sense."
3,This one is not the best by far!!,I have read all the Harry Potter books like the rest of the world it seems and this one is the bad one. It was just awful. You should read it though if you want to know whats going on. The end was just so dum I was literally laughing my head off. If you want to skip this book and go to the next which is much much better. If you know your fanasy animals like me you would know that they totaly messed up on the whole baslisk thing. So that is why I give this book a low rating. This one is the bad one. The rest are much better.
5,Harry Potter- The Author is a Genius,I love the Harry Potter books! I turely think they are really interesting. I read this book for school because i needed 100 hours of reading and now I am reading it for pure enjoyment. I cant wait to get the third book! I think the series is a book for all ages.
4,Yo! Cool! Right here!,"Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling books are great! I never liked to read but after I read the fist Harry Potter book I was hooked and I couldn't stop! Some opened the Chamber Of Secrets and everyone is getting petrified. So if you want a really good but not boring book,chose Harry Potter and you to will like reading."
5,The two Harry Potter books are the best books ever.,"I am going into grade 5, and I LOVE Harry Potter so much. I read each book at least 1 time a week. I love reading about Harry because he can do magic."
5,THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ,"I read this book non-stop for 2.5 days, I didn't do much of anything else. It appeals to me because I always have longed for wizards to exist, and in Harry's world I can shed my muggle skin enter a world of magic and mayhem. J.K. Rowling is an absolute genius. All the stars in the night sky aren't enough to rate this book!"
2,An easy read,"I know by doing this, I risk the hatred of the entire world. Please don't hate me. I'm only voicing my opinion. I think that Harry Potter requires no thought; you hate the villans, you love the heroes. I'm not saying that they're bad. They aren't. They're imaginative, and funny, and all-round feel-good books. I do recommend them, but not if you're looking for marvellously worked-out, amazingly profound books."
2,Harry Potter Shmary Potter,"This book shows the talents of an extremely good author, and a very imaginative plot. Actually, this would be a superb book, if it werent for the hero himself, Harry Potter. Harry is a mean, lucky, and rather snobbish character who never deserves the fame he gets. In all three books of the series, he defeats his enemy through luck or the help of some other character. He recieves presents anually, but NEVER GIVES ANYONE ANYTHING BACK! He is rich, yet won't spend a cent on his 'friends'. I say, keep up the good storytelling, great plots, and fantastic use of imagination, BUT GET A NEW CHARACTER! Sheesh!"
3,Over-hyped,"I think that the only reason this book gets the kind of reviewsit does it because it is written for nine year olds. The plot issimplistic (for kids) and any adult who found this book to be great fantasy novel, should probably look in the adult section next time they go into a book store. For all of you that want to read a great novel that will envelope you without the need to spell everything out, read ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy."
3,Mystery Roams,I rate this book 3 stars because it's action packed. At the same time it's mysticl and magical which goes into a mystery storyline. i also rate this book 3 stars because the chararcters connect when they are solving thier problems.i recommend this book to ages 10-12 because they will understand the difficult words better than little kids. The storyline changed and a more advanced mind like a 11 year old might understand the words better than a 7 year old.i think the protagonist Harry Potter is very suspicious during the time the first strike happene's. Tom Riddle is soneone that is very precise of his work.I think is very slow in the beginning because it is telling the basics of the storyline. I also think the action is very well described.
5,Adult reader.,Wonderful character development. Even better than Book 1. Chamber of Secrets will make a great action movie.Starting Book 3 shortly. I hear it's fantastic.
5,undoubtedly the darkest of the series,"Chamber of Secrets, as many and I say, is the darkest story of the four stories. It's a wonderful read, but it sets a gloomy setting which stays in the mind for a long time."
5,Where is the other star? This one deserves 6!,The second book is as good as the first! How often can you say that! Pick up the second adventure of Harry Potter and his diverse group of friends...and enemies...you won't be sorry! Read these books to your kids...read them to yourself...share them with your friends.... this is a series that shouldn't be missed!
5,This book was the best of the three!,"I think this book was the best out of all three that have been published. I liked it because there was a lot of suspense and action, humor, a good story line, drama, everything needed in a good book. If you haven't read this book, or any of the Harry Potter books, get out there and read them!"
4,Good but not Great,I've read all three books but Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets didn't seem as good as Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
4,A solid sequel,"Harry continues his adventures as he learns more about his background. This is just as entertaining as the first novel, and was definitely able to keep my attention."
5,It Was So Great!!,The strength of this book was that everything was great!! the only weakness that I can think of is the wait for the next book.-Delaney Bourgeois
4,Once more into the breach...,"Book 2 is really a replay of book 1 and works to reinforce the basic structure of the series. The plot, including the finale, is actually better designed than in book 1, but there isn't as much emotion behind it. The fact that Harry is a wizard isn't new anymore. We spend the book getting used to life inside Hogwarts alongside Harry. It is a fun journey, but not quite as exciting as the initial discovery."
5,EXCELLENT SERVICE! GREAT BUYER!,Received item quickly. Just as described. Book used but in excellent condition. Could not have made a better buy. THANK YOU. MERRY CHRISTMAS!
5,HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS COLLECTOR'S EDITION,ITEM JUST AS DESCRIBED ! FAST AND FRIENDLY ! A REAL PLEASURE DOIN BUSINESS WITH ... THANK YOU !
5,Harry Potter!,"These books are just wonderful. I have read all of them, the story line, everything about them is wonderful. Great read."
4,Getting better,"Being somewhat vaguely disappointed with the first book as I felt Rowling took 'simple' routes out of complex problems, I was quite impressed with the 2nd book! Suddenly, the little complexities I expected to be there WERE there! I found this book a lot harder to put down and read it from cover to cover in 2 nights flat - TV doesn't quite make the standard compared to the wonderful world of Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarts School that was generated in my mind!I don't think ANY young fertile and creative mind should be deprived of the wonderful fanasty world of Harry Potter! Personally though, I will admit to having a desire to go to Kingscross Station and seeing how many children try to get to Platform 9 3/4's... And what harm is there in glancing up at the sky periodically to see if a car is flying overhead or waiting at the mailbox when you turn 11 to see if you will get a letter from Hogwart's...?"
3,Harry Potter 2,"Harry's aunt and uncle were so mean to him over the summer that all he wanted to do was go back to Hogwarts. When Harry was packing, he got a strange warning by an elf-like thing named Dobby who told Harry if he returned to Hogwarts, disaster would strike. But Harry went back anyway. Just as Dobby warned, disaster struck. Harry, now in his second year at Hogwarts and with a new teacher named Gilderoy Lockhart who comes into class in a very stuck up mood, along with him is a ghost known as Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girl's bathroom. Now the real problems begin. Someone or something is turning the kids into stone! Who could it be? Well, you'll just have to read it to find out. So pick up Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, written by J.K. Rowling at your local libary or bookstore. I recommend this book to all of you."
5,henry potter and the chamber of secrets & the other h.p book,I gave this book to my 12 year old granddaughter along with the other 2 titles; she loved them as did her 9 year old brother and their mother is now reading them to her 3rd and 4th grade class which also loves the books. They were a real hit!
4,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Harry Potter is an eleven year old boy. He likes to go on adventures. he goes to a school named Hogwarts. He opens a dungeon and discovers something amazing. If you want to discover something amazing, read this book"
3,not all it's cracked up to be,"I loved the other three (the first, the third, and the fourth) but I have to say, I found this second book to be a disappointment. The plot seemed contrived and fairly drawn-out, which is odd considering that it's the shortest book of the series; and the characters were aimless. Hermione's character particularly seems not only oddly absent, but she makes a series of very un-Hermione-like decisions that would have been better left to Ron or Harry. Guilderoy Lockheart, unlike Kenneth Branagh's excellent characterization in the movie, is downright irritating and useless, and not just to other characters in the book, but also to the reader.All in all, it seemed like a very limp addition to the series after the first book; not terrible, but not exactly up to my expectations. I realize this often happens in the second installment of any series, and am really thankful to say that ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" makes up for any shortcomings in ""Chamber of Secrets""."
5,***As delightful as the first***,"Funny, thrilling and just a good read....this is a great second book. No, it does not have the depth of some other young reader novels, but the story simply sweeps you away, if you let it. It is very much the type of book that I remember vaguely from my preteen years---a very warm and cozy book for a cold, rainy afternoon....one filled with such vivid imagery that you feel like you are right there in the middle of a Quiddich game or suffering through breakfast with the Dursleys....one that made me feel like I wish I had been born a wizard to Muggle parents...."
5,Harry Potter strikes again!,"I was thrilled by Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I felt the story was more complex, with lots of other conflicts. ""You know who"" comes back as always, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are in for a BIG suprise."
4,A good book,"This book is a good book that sucks you in and is hard to put down. J.K. Rowling is a great author. This book is probably one of the weaker one's in the series, though. The only thing I don't get is how this book got 5 stars and so many other great books that tower over and of the Harry Potter books got 4 and a half of 4 stars. It's probably because anyone could read Harry Potter and enjoy it, as their isn't much thought involved."
5,Yet another Muggle hooked on Harry,"I'm 32 years old and originally bought these books for my infant son, thinking (with all the hype going on) this might be cute to read to him at night. We started with one chapter a night, but after the first two nights I couldn't wait any longer and read it all the way through. Then I got my husband to read them. We loved it and were hooked! J.K. Rowling has a wonderful writing style that both children and adults can enjoy. The children characters are easy to relate with at any age. A great book for parents and children to enjoy TOGETHER!"
5,Read in 2 days..,I simply could not put it down. More secrets and characters appear in Harry's second year at Hogwarts and they were just as uniquie and different as the first year. It was just as good as the first if not better. I would recommend this book very highly. I am very excited to read all of the Potter books.
4,Chamber of Secrets Reveiw,"If you haven't read this book already, then keep on reading. In the first part of the book Harry has the worst birthday in his young life at number 4 Private Drive. Harry then meets Dobby, a little worker elf, who tries to warn Harry not to go back to Hogwarts. Later in the book, Harry and Ron miss the train to Hogwarts and have to drive Ron's Dad's car to the school and end up in the magical Whomping Willow tree. I don't want to give the rest away so go and get the book and you can find out what Harry's second year is like at Hogwarts."
5,THE BEST BOOK!!!,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the best Harry Potter book ever!!!! It was the continued book of the first Harry Potter. The second book takes place at his second year at Hogwarts. In this book Harry discovers a chamber and a mysterious family member. I would definitely recomend this book to kids of all ages!!!
3,Not nearly as good as Sorcerer's Stone,"The Chamber of Secrets was good, but not nearly as good as the Sorcerer's Stone. In this sense, I was disappointed. Maybe the bar was set too high with the first book? It felt like almost the exact same format as the Sorcerer's Stone, only different red herrings. Reading the book began to remind me of watching a bootlegged rerun.I hate to say it, but towards the second half, I just couldn't wait for the Chamber of Secrets to end. I am sure the 3rd book will be better. We haven't given up on Harry Potter, but may take a short break."
3,Some things in this book just don't make sense!,"First I must admit I did enjoy reading the book and that I do not dislike it, but I just couldn't help feeling a little disappointed when I finished it. Some things just don't make sense here. For one thing, if Howgarts can hire a teacher like Lockhart, you can't help but wonder if Dumbledore is really that wise when he can allow such an idiot in the faculty. In this book Dumbledore doesn't live up to his image in the previous book. I think if Rowling had let Dumbledore give us an explanation at the end like she always has, as to why he hired Lockhart in the first place, it'd have definitely made Dumbledore look more worthy of Harry's trust. The Chamber of Secrets is certainly a thrilling book, but not as brilliant as the first."
3,Harry Potter,"This book ""Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets"" by J.K. Rowling was just an okay book. The book is about Harry and his friends at their school of magic ""Hogwarts"". In this story someone is threatening the students by attacking students and then writing that the legendary ""Chamber of Secrets"" had been open. So Harry and his friends try to find out who did it. This book would be good to read if you are into stories about magic and adventure. It has also been made into a movie so if you read the book and liked it or didn't want to read it you might like the movie."
5,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Well it starts out that Harry is staying at his aunt and uncle's house the Dursleys.And their treating him like trash.This book is awsome.Oh!I love the magic and action.Well this is my review.You'll have to read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
5,Title for Review,"I thought, and still think, that this book was excellent. I read the English version (being English) and found myself laughing out loud several times. I think that the storyline was really gripping and I could hardly put the book down. I love the way J.K. Rowling always puts twists in her stories and I think that all children young and old(er) should read it."
4,Harry goes back for his second year at Hogwarts,"Harry Potter looks forward to his second year at Hogwarts. His Muggle relatives are especially horrible and lock him in his room. He receives a disturbing visit from Dobby the house elf, before the Weasley boys rescue him and bring him to their home. Things don't seem to go as well this year. Draco Malfoyle has bought himself onto his house's Quidditch team and is determined to make life miserable for Harry. Ron's little sister has a crush on him, and the new professor is a publicity hound who seems to want to use Harry for more attention. There is much more going on, someone has opened the dreaded Chamber of Secrets, which threatens wizards with Muggle blood.There is so much detail in these novels, yet they flow smoothly from one to the other. This is a really wonderful series."
5,The Original Serie,"Before i read Harry Potter, i thought imagination could not create completely new things: i thought it had to mix real things to create new ones (as humans and horses to make centaurs, horses and birds to make griffins, etc), and that it was that that made books boring and not original; you can read a vampires book and have fun, but after reading five, you don't want to hear anything about vampires. How wrong i was!!!!!!Things in Harry potter are so new, so original and are written with such ""magic"" that it creates a new imagination world, from where you don't want to leave.I personally enjoyed a lot reading this book, and, in fact, all the serie; and it made me get reading (and writing) again, because now i know that there're still new thigs.fidelstar@yahoo.com.arIstari"
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,every one of the books in the harry potter series is brilliantly written by jk rowling. but this particular one happens to be my favorite
3,Not nearly as good as the first book,I loved the first book and cound not wait until the second in the series arrived at my door. I started to read the book as soon as I ripped it from the mail order packaging and did not stop until I had read through the final pages. I was disappointed that the book was so predictable and lacked all of the thrill that was served up in the first book. Nothing that happened in the second book suprised me and I found myself hoping that the author would provide a more descriptive offerring as to what she was explaining. I have pre-ordered the third in the series and hopefully it will be closer to the quality of the first book...
5,"CAN WE SAY, GOOD BOOK?","so awesome. this book is just so darn awesome!!!!! Harry is the most ingenious little character, the plot is original, the style is cute, the ending is extremely likable. PLEASE, MISS ROWLING, CAN I HAVE SOME MORE????/"
5,A magical book!,"I read about Harry Potter and the Socer's Stone last year and got it for my 12 year old son for Christmas. My son, my daugher (15), and I (47) all read the book and loved it. I got the new Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as soon as it came out, and again we all read it and loved it. The kids thought the new book was even better than the first one because it included a mystery. I enjoyed the first one more, because the ideas were so orignal and fresh; the ideas don't have quite the same impact"
5,It's a great book of a boy-wizard who loves adventures,"I think that this is a good book because it is so intriquing and i couldn't put it down. Harry Potter has ambitions, bravery, couriousity in him and i love that about him."
5,Excellent reading fun for kids and the adults who love them!,What fun!! I read the books and couldn't put them down. Hooray for Harry and all his friends. Wonderful reading for kids and adults. I am collecting the series in hardcover for my 4 month old grandson to read together as he gets older. He will learn that you don't have to be the handsomest or smartest to be a hero. Thanks J.K Rowling - You go girl!!
5,Thriller to the end!,This book is a fantasy book about a boy named Harry Potter who is a wizard.When I first read this book I thought it would be just like the first one(even thougth I liked the first one!).As I read I realized I was wrong.It keeps you on the edge of your seat.It was also mysterious and thrilling.I could not put it down.I would definitely recomend this book.
3,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"I think this book had a very good ending but it was a slow start I almost stoped reading the book. Filled with suspence and action this book has a good plot but this book was very ""thin"" in my opinion, so this book was ok because the ending more than picked up the slack. In all in all the book was very good if your patient but if you don't you'll never get through this book."
3,A good but sort of boring book,"Yes, I really like the Harry Potter books. But this one needed more exitment to it. It was a good story but not great."
3,Harry,Harry Potter is very resourceful and shows a great love and strong loyalty to his friends. Great book for kids. I would recommend this book for kids of all ages.
4,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"O~MY~GOSH! Although I liked the first Harry Potter book a bit more, this one lived up to my expectations about 98%. A definate must~read for Harry Potter fans and those alike! Much love to J.K Rowling for such a GOOD series! I hope she plans on keepin up on Harry's years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as well as (hopefully) hsi years beyond the school. This book, like the first, force you into it. It is almost as if you could look around and totally envision Peeves, the school poltergeist, or Ron Weasly, Harry's red-headed best friend. It totally submearses the reader into its world of magic and wizardry. An absolute Must Read for children, teenagers, young adults, and afults alike! 4 1/2 stars! I look forward to reading the 3rd book in the series Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban as well as the 4th book, Harry Potter and the Doomsday Spell. Thank You So Much Ms. Rowling! melanie"
5,I love Harry Potter,"Harry Potter is a fun and delightful character. With his friends Hermione and Ron, he has adventures that surprize even is wizard teachers and classmates. I couldn't put Harry Potter(book #1 or #2) down and I finished each in about a day. This book captured my attention and I had to hold on for dear life."
5,Amazing!!!! says the Fat Cat Times,This book was truly engaging. A delightful story for children and adults of all ages
5,AN ABSOLUTE MUST-READ!!!!!!,"This must be the best book in all history of man kind. The only book that can even come close is the first Harry Potter! This is a wounderful book by it self, but even better with Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone. If you only read one series in your entire life, make it Harry. This book is well put togther, way out there but besides that the writting is beliveable. It makes you wounder if there really is a hogwarts and a whole nother world we don't know about. It is the most wounderful work of fiction I have ever read and I hope every person in the entire world gets a chance to read this book more than ont time! I have read it 13 times myself!!!"
5,One of the best in the series!!!,"I have read all seven books and there are reasons to pick any of them as your favorite. However what draws me to this one is the mix of mystery along with everything else. Especially interesting is the glimpse you get of Lord Voldemort's earlier life and the ideas that became an obsession with him. This book is not as intense as the later ones were, but it is one of the best, along with The Order of the Phoenix."
4,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secret,It is a great book!I really enjoyed it and I am looking forward to read more about Harry Potter
5,You got to love snakes,Harry Potter finds out that he can speak parsel toung ‘talks to snakes‘ if your a Harry Potter fan this is a must read.
5,Best book ever,I couldn't stop reading it it was amazing I would recommend this book to people of all ages hope u enjoy
5,So much fun reading to my kids!,I love reading the first 3 books to my young ones. I am hoping to get them interested in finishing the series on their own.
5,Excellent!,AS a big Harry Potter fan I was very pleased with how excellent the condition of the book was. Thank you!
5,A great book for anyone,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the sequal to Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. J.K. Rowling is a very talented writer. Some say this book is not as good as the first. I strongly disagree. This book is incredibly interesting and fun to read. I could hardly put it down. It is very diffrent from the first book but is still great. The author describes things vividly and write creatively. There is no way you could guess who has opened the Chamber of secrets and is petrifying people so they look dead. It starts with Harry Having an awful summer with the Dursley's and fools them into thinking he is aloud to do magic in the ""muggle"" world, but when they find out he isn't its trouble for Harry!"
5,HARRY POTTER IS THE BEST!!!!!!,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is even better than Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone! Whoever put ages 9 to 12 on the book is wrong! This book is for all ages! Our sixth grade class read The Sorcerer's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets this year and we LOVED it! We were always begging our teacher to read it to us and when she did, we were all absolutely silent! We love to fantasize about playing Quidditch or being a wizard! Most of us now own both books and are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the third. WE LOVE HARRY POTTER!!!!!!!"
5,It is as good as the last one!,"When I read ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" for the first time (it is the first book that I have read more than one time), I thought there could be no book better than it. I was amazed when I read the sequel!!!! It is the best book I have ever read, it is so detailed, it has so many clues - it also has new characters, and the old ones, like Ron, and my favorite, Hermione Granger. IT IS A GREAT BOOK!"
5,THE BEST,This book is the best. It has the same interest as the last one and is very exciting. I can no stop reading it!!! I have also heard that J.K. Rowling is planning to release 4 more. The next one is called harry potter and the prisoner from azkaban
1,Not what I expected,"This says library binding, but it is not. Library binding is when the book is actually sewn together for durability. This is a paperback in size and quality with a hard cover that has a bad version of the cover art."
1,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"I like harry poterand the chamber of secrets because it had more magic,action and adventeurs than the first book. My favorite part was when harry pulled out the sword out of the sorting hat and killed the baskiles. I think it is good how it is. I read becuase it was the scond book and I like the fris book so thats why I read the scond book.R.F."
1,I love this book,"I was reading some of the reviews when I noticed one that said that, people over ten that read this book should be ashamed. You need to learn that just because a book is meant for a younger audience doesn't mean that no one else will enjoy it. I happen to be 14 and I love this book. I enjoy the fantasy, that Rowling so carefully weaves into our imagination. I like the idea of a school like Hogwarts, especially compared to the school that I attend now. I do like the Redwall books and Tolkiien's books are right up there but that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy the Harry Potter books. I honestly think that the Harry Potter books are good for any age, and no one should be ashamed of reading these great books. I think this book deserves a 5 star but I put a one star to get your attention, since no one including me reads the 5 stars."
2,"Dear, Lord...","All right, the first Harry Potter book was Ok; the whole deal with Diagon Alley; the unpredictable ending, etc. But this one...lacked even the qualities that made the first one barely readable.TCoS is even skimpier than TSS, and again, there is little storyline. The ending was obvious, pointless, and did nothing to advance the tale of Harry (which I've now lost complete interest in). By now you've probably read the excerpts of the story tons of times, so you know what this is about. Nothing. Harry is a character I can't care for no more than his... little goody friends.The only reason I gave this book two stars is because of the new teacher that replaced Quirrel, he was about all the comic relief in this book (and there wasn't very much).Please, save yourselves from these two hundred pages of complete and utter drivel and get something readable. Kids may not be able to tell the difference between good literature and bad, so get this for them if you're stuck for a gift."
2,HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS,I THOUGHT THAT HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS WAS A FAIR BOOK I MEAN IT WAS GREAT BUT IT WASN'T THE BEST . I THINK THAT THE OTHER BOOKS WERE MUCH MUCH BETTER BECAUSE THEY HAD MORE EXITMENT IT WASN'T JUST LIKE A REAL YEAR NOT FUN AAND NOT-VERY-LIKELY TO HAPPEN . THE BEGINNING WAS OKAY AND I WOULD GIVE IT ABOUT A 1 BUT THE END WAS REALLY INTERESTING AND LIKE THE OTHER BOOK IT ALL TIED TOGETHER REAL WELL SO EVERYTHING IN THE BOOK REALLY MATTERED SO SHE REALLY DIDN'T GIVEANY USELESS INFO. THE BOOK WASN'T EXACTLY BAD BUT IT WAS NOT ANYTHING TO THE OTHER TWO WHICH WERE GREAT.
2,EXTREMELY STUPID!!!,"My 12 year old son and I read this book together for a book report he was doing....We got about half way through, and decided it was TOO stupid to read on...I think the author has a wonderful imagination, but she should use it in a different capacity. I gave it 2 stars just to be nice!"
3,"One step up, two steps back","I hate to give this book three stars, but I simply don't feel that this book was quite as good as the original, to which I gave four; and there not being a three-and-a-half star option, I've got to go with three stars.Not to give the impression that this book is bad; not by any means. For the most part, I feel the book was a wonderful follow-up. However, I felt the end was cheating a bit, particularly in regards to the sword and the Sorting Hat (and if you've already read the book, you'll know to what I'm referring). It seemed to come out of nowhere. I felt that it could have been set up much better.Still, if you liked the first book, I see no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this one as well. Even though I thought it was a bit of a step backwards from the first book, it's only a temporary step back, as the next book in the series, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", would be the best one yet, and well worth working towards."
3,Good/okay,"I loved the cover of the book and found the book quite interesting but, did find it a little scary for yonger children that may have read this book.I think J.K. Rowling is a very creative author and should make a Harry Potter Store."
4,Harry himself is a bit of a duffer....,"...I beleive that, perhaps, he is meant to do stupid things sometimes so that you feel superior (not unlike Dr. Watson from Doyle's famed stories). The books are excellently written, however. Some of the most delightful characters are Hagrid, Hermione, the Weasley twins, Prof. McGonagall, Prof. Dumbledore, Prof. Flitwick, and above all Prof. Snape. They are obviously all exaggerated versions of people that Rowling once knew. No one could make up someone like Snape."
4,Totally Tubular,Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets is about a kid & his magical powers. This book is very interesting. I liked this book because I am into magic. The only thing I didn't like about this book is it is a fantasy book. But if you like a fantasy or magic this is a good book to read.
5,I Loved This Book,"I just loved this book so much. I read all three books and I can't wait to get the fourth. My brother hates this book, which I don't think he should. He always tries to karate chop the book. I am seven and he is four. The book is just great. Maybe when my brother grows up he will love it too."
4,This book has to become a classic,"I immediately fell in love with Harry Potter while reading the first two chapters in line at the store. I feel that the twists and turns in the book are quite clever. I did find that the beginning of the book was much better than the end. I thought there was a bit too much violence at times even though I was deeply aware that good would triumph over evil. Despite being a bit uncomfortable with, for example, Dobby having to punish himself and some of the ghoul/death scenes: May I join in the thousands who just love this series and who can't wait to read another!!?"
2,SLOW,the item took a month to arrive and i did not recieve a response when i enquired about why it was taking so long
2,Not as good as the first,"I didn't like this one as much as the first. I think I might take a break from this series.But I did like this quote. It's Professor Dumbledore talking to Harry: ""It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."""
5,Another Rowlings Classic,"Each of these books in the Harry Potter series is a 'cover to cover read', as soon as I can buy them. Each is a gift to world literature."
5,this is the best book ever,harry potter and the chamber of secrets is the best book ever and i cant wait for the other 5 books its like waiting for a sequle to a movie it would be cool if they made movies out of all the harry potter books
2,the BEST book!,"The 2 stars were just to get your attention because I never read the 5 stars. I'm 13 and I LOVE this book! Now I'm reading the book to my sister (10), brother (8), and my mom. They love it too! All those people who are talking about 'evil witchcraft' are crazy! This book is great for all ages! A MUST read! :)"
3,A big disapointment ...,This was a big disapointment for me. When I read the first 3 chapters I almost fell asleep it was so boring despite how many things happend. Jk. Rowling definetly made a big mistake on this book. It was absolutely horrible! I didn't even finish the whole book ...Later I was tempted to finish the book because I wanted to read the third one. I finished it ... um ... I just want to say it was pretty good at the end but the beginning ... could make you fall asleep. :)Overall: Once you get past the first couple of chapters you'll fnd the excitement. Read only if you want to read the rest of the series.
4,A different angle,"Of the three Harry Potter books so far published, this is not the best. However, the quality of the writing and story are still far above the competition. Volume two changes direction a bit and messes with perceptions of time and existence. The theme is done a little better and more intricately in book three, but this book is worth buying. If for no other reason, buy it to get the story on why Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts so long ago."
5,Total Epicness,"This was by far the most amazing book I've ever read! Its fantasy and comedy all bunched into one exciting, suspenseful ,supercalafrgilisticexpialidosious book I have ever read! This is by far a great book for kids of all ages!"
5,Harry Potter is the BEST!,"When my sister first started reading brought home a book about some guy named Harry Potter and said it was wonderful, I thought she was crazy. Then, I sat down to read the first chapter, and I couldn't put it down. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"", the second volume in the series is just as amazing as the first. Filled with mystery, suspense, adventure, and (of course) magic, this is deffiantely a wonderful story. All Harry Potter fans, anyone who loves fantasy stories, or anyone who just loves a great book will truly enjouy ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" and all the books in this wonderful series."
5,Another winner!,"J.K. Rowling has done it again! This book picks right up where the first one leaves us. The thing I like most about this series is that the characters are so believeable...well, not in the magical sense, but personality-wise. I can see shades of old classmates (and current co-workers, friends, etc.) in every single character. I cannot say enough about Harry Potter! Young, old, urban, rural...read these books! Also check out The Chronicles of Narnia if you haven't already...it is the prelude to the Harry Potter series, in my book!"
3,mildly entertaining,"The first half of the book, introducing us to the Dursleys and Hogwarts, was fairly entertaining (at least to someone like me who has never read a Harry Potter book before- though I have seen a couple of the movies). The escalating perils in the second half of the book seemed pretty formulaic to me- Harry meets bug eyed monsters, Harry wins, Harry meets Voldemort, Harry wins. This formula might be entertaining to most children, but I felt less engaged by the book in the last few chapters than I did earlier on."
4,"Not as good as VOL1, 2, or 4",I have read the first four volumes in the series. I think this is the poorest of the four and would actually skip it when I reread the series. I am 62 so not still a child. I enjoyed 1 and 4 the best.
2,Overrated. The Hardy Boys meet Goosebumps.,"OK, so I'm the only one who had not heard the hype of Harry Potter before I picked up this book. Yet once I told folks that I was about to read it, their enthusiasm overwhelmed me. Frankly, I just don't get it. Maybe it's because I'm uncomfortable reading made-up words and names that can't be easily pronounced. Or because characters such as Moaning Myrtle in the bathroom could have been dreamed up by the writers of Saturday Night Live. Or that magic is used by the author to provide simple endings to complex situations. If only I could believe that the Quidditch game rules were designed to actually work (try drawing the game field, players, etc. to see what I mean). Sorry, Harry, I think you're going down in history as a fad, not a legend."
2,"Magnetizing, but too dark for kids.","A friend bought my children the first three books in the series, so I previewed them. I had a hard time putting them down, I must admit. However, the violence level is horrifying. In Prisoner of Azkaban, the lead evil wizard kills thirteen people while laughing maniacally. Not kids stuff."
5,Harry potter wins again.,Very good book tells a tale good always wins over evil every time. How the under dog win I'm the end
2,Harry Potter,Good Should get it fun to read and tO enjoy this wonderful book to enjoy in the winter time is awesome
4,It Was Cool,"I enjoyed it but the Author didn't bring the continued magic from the 1st book. I missed some of her background characters, especially Neville"
5,An Amazing Follow Up,"Harry potter and the Chamber of secrets is a great book! The 2nd book has a lot more action and you see more chemistry between the characters. The books just keep on getting better. I definitely recommend this book for anyone, all ages can read it and I can assure you, you will enjoy it!!"
4,Harry Potter an the Chamber of Secrets,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by JK Rowling is about a boy who goes to a magic school named Hogwarts. There are three main characters; Harry,Ron, and Hermony. They helped Harry get through the traps. Then he finds out someone is trying to kill him. Harry is my favorite character. He gets all the cool toys.I can't really relate to any of the characters in the story because I don't go to magic school and I don't hane a pet. . I really like the book because I like adverture stores. I don't have a least favorite part because the whole book was pretty neat and I wouldn't change anything about it.I would recommend this book to 13 years of age and above. If someone likes adventure stories then this book is for you. But if you don't then don't bother reading this book."
5,Yo Yo Yo Check this out! NOW,"The book I read was Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling. The book was about Harry Potter and his crazy adventure. Harry, Ron, and, Hermine have opened the Chamber of Secrets. My favorite part was when they went into the spider cave. If you want to see how Harry and his friends solve this mystery. Read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling."
4,The Secret's out.,"If you have children aged between 8 and 13, they will absolutely love this book. If you like to read to your younger children, you will love this book. There is intrigue, suspense, drama, comedy and best of all, magic. It is one of several stories about Harry Potter, a young boy who thought he was quite normal until he found out he was a wizard. The three books published so far are about Harry and his time at Hogwart's School of Wizardry and Witchcraft. Each book covers a full year at the school. This book is his second year and his search for the secrets within the castle of Hogwarts. If you like Roald Dahl or C.S. Lewis, you will love Harry Potter and his adventures. This book is one of many excellent stories. A must for any parent who loves fantasy."
3,I don't know...,"Well, I decided to give this series another try after originally reading the first two. I didn't particularly like them before, but now I think they're enjoyable, if definitely standard, fantasy. I read this book in a couple of hours, and it was a very easy read. The plot is much like the first book, but maybe that's intentional. I like the fact that there is a mystery involved in these books, but the suspense is not built up anywhere near enough. I don't get it, really. I don't understand WHAT everyone sees in these books. I think they're just a fad. We'll see what happens in 30 years... Anyway, I'm determined to finish the series now, just to keep up with things, but I know they get progressivly longer, so I don't think that's a good sign. Anyway, I don't know, maybe I'm missing something, but I just don't get it..."
2,Disappointing,"The Chamber of Secrets reads like a charicature. All the characters are in place. The bad ones act their role and do bad things, while the good ones try to keep out of trouble. There is no character development, no new information, no additional dimension to the story. It's like watching string puppets going through the motions. The first Harry Potter was good, though, and the third one seems better than the second."
5,"Have absolutely enjoyed reading these books, even as a 24 year old female!","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Book 2)Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Book 3)Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: 10th Anniversary Edition (Harry Potter)I have enjoyed reading these books so far. I have only read the first three, but have heard that they get even better from here! I enjoy the story lines and how the characters interact with each other. It is interesting to watch (read) the characters as they grow up, and experience growth in many areas."
5,Excellent Item,"I received the product in a very good condition, almost like new and before the date expected. I'm very happy with this purchase and I plan to buy from them again in the future."
4,a world of its own,"Once again Harry arrives in his second book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry has to escape from his home at the Dursleys and breaks quite a number of magician rules in the process, but fortunately he was able to continue his stay at Hogwart's school for magic. Soon enough weird things start happening around school, all the suspicion falls upon Harry, but Harry and his friends will stop at nothing to find out the truth. Along the way Harry is confronted several times with his ultimate enemy, Draco Malfoy, who will stop at nothing to get the best of the, ""so called,"" famous Harry Potter. This book sets the stand for the Harry Potter books that are yet to come and leaves the reader desperately wanting the next book in this extraordinary series."
5,one of the 7 best books in the universe,harry potter and the chambers of secerets is one of the seven greatest books in the universe and i still can't belive... gave it a 4 1/2 .i really ask you to read this book but read the first book first.
3,The Giant Snake,"i thought that this book was on of the greatest bookes that there is. Evrn though i havent reead the 3 or 4th on yet. and those are probably better. but i would have never guess that T.M. Riddle was invovled in the killing. And that a snake had anything to do with it. i was think that it was pretty kool how the author made it so if anyone looked into the snakes eys they would die and it was a good thing that nobody in the story did and that they on saw half, the reflection or they blinked.Thanks for your time"
5,Suspenseful fantasy at its best,"HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is the second inJ.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, delivering chills, scares,delight, and surprises! We find Harry in his second year at Hogwarts, and he's surrounded by the same friends and enemies, but that's where the sameness ends and the differentness begins! New characters show up, new adventures are introduced, new horrors await.Danger is on the loose at Hogwarts, and many people believe that Harry's to blame. Harry's got a new fame-hungry professor to dodge, Quidditch matches to win, friends to protect, and mysteries to solve. The story unfolds at a rapid pace, and the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets is intriguing.In the Harry Potter books, Rowling has created a fantastic world of magic in the vein of C.S. Lewis' NARNIA, Madeleine L'Engle's A WRINKLE IN TIME, or Roald Dahl's MATILDA. Any fans of fantasy should be sure to read the Harry Potter books, as they hold their own alongside these classics."
5,Excellent book; interesting themes,"I'm very glad I decided to read this series in spite of thehype. Rowling takes many of the best elements of fantasy fiction andadapts them for a younger audience without dumbing them down. Very, very enjoyable.One of the things that struck me about this book was the consistent disparagement of hero worship. Not only was the insufferable Gilderoy Lockhart made fun of, but Harry's fellow students who acted like groupies were shown to be on dangerous ground. It's nice to see this book tweak the all-too-common worship of idols, while showing respect for characters who have earned it (Dumbledore).I liked it, but not quite as much as the first book. Looking forward to getting my hands on the 3rd."
5,Harry Potter #2,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a great book. It is about Harry finding a secret chamber at Hogwarts.Harry and his friends are trying to figure out what is in the chamber. To see how he does this, read the book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It was written by J.K. Rowling."
4,J.K Strikes again,This book is almost as good as the first one. It's incredible that an author can captivate audiences with two books in a row!
3,"Good, but not great","The weakest of the Harry Potters, but still fun none the less. It lacks the depth of characters of the later books, and the new innocence of the first book, and never quite finds its place in the series. While the first book is effectively an introduction of the series and the characters and the third book introduces the true, dark plot of the series, the second gets lost in between.That having been said, its still a wonderfully entertaining book and more than worth your time."
4,Hype machine.,"Here comes the second band wagon, has your kid jumped on it yet? This is the Britney Spears of children's fantasy. The music is bad, the singing is almost decent, but the hype is tremendous. The controversy also brews.Despite the fact that J.K. Rowling is not that much more than an overhyped plum, the series is still great for your kids. Why? Because they'll grow up thinking that reading can be fun. And that's an attitude that's more valuable than all the diamonds in Africa.So buy this for your kids if for no other reason than to get them to READ!"
5,It took me back to my childhood of dreams and fantasies.,This book really took me back to my early days of dreams and fantasies. I could almost taste the candies the author described. The honesty and bravery of Harry Potter I admired and wished I had had a friend like him when I was young. I am very much looking forward to the next adventure! But sad to say all three of my book stores in town are sold out of the secound book. I feel like a little kid impatiently awaiting for the next book and I am 31. I had really wanted to take it on my vacation with me. Boo Hoo!!
4,I Know Why I like It; I Don't Know Why the Rest of You Do,"The Harry Potter Books are all quite good, if not quite as good as their press. Harry Potter himself is an engaging, if not particularly complex, young man, and his collection of friends and enemies at school are, if a bit overly broadly drawn, eminently enjoyable.On the other hand, collectively the books aren't a patch on Diane Duane's Wizard books. (Start with http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0152012397.) Why the Harry Potter books have become modern classics, and the Duane books haven't will remain a mystery.At least to me. Everything that the Harry Potter books do, much juvenile science fiction and fantasy does better, and has done better for a long time. The Heinlein juveniles are simply, in every respect, better books, as are the Duane books.So: read the Harry Potter books; they're good. But don't stop there."
5,BUY AND READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!,I was really surprised when I saw that the age recommendation for all of the HArry Potter books is 9-12. I first saw thses books on Rosie O'Donnel and she loved them. I am assuming she is over 12. And so am and I and all of my friends. I recommended it to almost everyone I talk to. You MUST READ THIS BOOK!
5,I enjoyed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was Great,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of azkaban was very gripping. I was hooked from the begining to the facinating end. I thought the knight bus was a very good idea, and i loved how Harry had to go stay in Diagon Alley. I was over joyed when the weaselys got money, and was very happy when Hagrid got the care of magical creatures job. I think my favorite chapter was the one where Harry got the marauders map. The wizerds town was a wonderful idea! I think i may have another favorite characher in Sirius Black. Read this book as soon as you can."
5,WOW!!!,"I was in a bookstore (no this isnt a big story) and i saw this book by J. K. Rowlings there. i read the back and thought it sounded pretty good but i was relutant to read it cause i was afraid it might take place of my favorite author. So a few days later may friends came over and asked if i had read the book. I said no and so they told me to read it. I'm sooo glad i did! it was an awsome book. i can't say there's just a few things i liked about this book cause there were like a billion things! Now i have to read the other 2 books cause i read this one first (oopsy)! And just not to leave out my (now other) favorite author... if you liked this book read one by Tamora Peirce (Lioness, Protector of the small, or Immortals quartet skip circle of magic!)!!!!!"
5,The Best Book I've ever Read!!,"My friend bought the first Harry Potter and lent it tome...after i read it, i was amazed. I decided to go for the nextbook, it was even better than the first book...It kept me interested for hours. I strongly believe that this is the best fantasy book out yet."
3,not as good as the first one,"i do not think it was a s good as the first one but heres my thoughtsi thought that harry potter and the chamber of secrets was more spookier than the first one but it didn't have as much plot as the first onei could see that harry potter was growing up too fast. 12 years old? give me a break. he looked about 8 and that is my full thoughtthe part that really caught my eye is when herione granger was petrified. that was so sad. but she still was annoying sometimes.when i read the first one, i thought, ""i want to pull myself into the magicsl world"" but on this one i felt dulli felt this one was a little boring but i liked it i'm giving it 3 stars bye bye"
5,Escape to the Chamber of Secrets,"Harry Potter has never been accused of being a Nobel Prize contender, but I firmly believe that not every book has to be. Harry Potter is quite entertaining, however. I downed the entire book in one day because I couldn't stop turning the pages.In Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, something at Hogwarts has been turning those closest to Harry into stone. There is an addictive quality to Harry Potter that just sucks the reader in. I kept turning the page, trying desperately to put the pieces together to figure out just who was turning people into stone.Pacing is Rowling's ultimate gift because she gives the reader pieces of the story puzzle, but not enough where the reader finds the ending tired and predictable. Can't wait to read more!"
5,A must read book!,This book was excellent! Everyone must read these Harry Potter books they are unlike any book ever written. They are the best books i have ever read!
3,Harry Potter and the chambers of secrets,This Harry Potter book was the only one I read but it was a good book.It surprised me in many ways.I liked how the author gave each character a unique name or how she gave the friends something in common but at the same time they were different.The character that I like was Ron Weasley because he had a rat as a pet and he seems like if he was a real person he would be a good friend.I also like his dad because he wasn't use to the mortal world so he was intrested in every little thing about what Harry did.
4,Good book,I chose this book so that I could eventually read the others. Was a great book . Now I'm happy
4,A Great Novel,"I really enjoyed reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I liked it because it was one of thoes books where it's good from the first page all the way to the last word. Some books I read and it doesn't really get into the plot until half ways through the book. Another thing I enjoyed about this book was that after reading it I went back and looked at the front cover and the pictures that are on the page when you start a new chapter, and it looks just like how I read it. This book really got exciting in the last fifty pages or so, because Harry was finally going to do what he has been planning in his summer at Hogwarts. I wouldn't suggest reading this book until you have read Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone."
2,Why are peple raving?,"When I first read this book I was ""in love"". Now I think back and think, What catches people? I would like to say J.K. Rowling presents a fine problem, and her plot isn't weak. But the rest of the book is to predictable. Leave Harry to others, for me, I'll take the Lord of the Rings!"
4,A bit darker than the first book.,"This book is a bit darker than the first book. It was okay, but it almost made me lose interest in reading the rest of the series, but I think I'll continue on with it anyway. I liked the parts where Harry speaks Parsel Tongue, but I hated the giant snake altogether. Rowling did a great job with description because I had no trouble imagining the snake and it's sounds; it's just not my cup of tea. I like Harry's relationship with his friends and I'd like to know a bit more about the lives of his enemies. I look forward to finishing the rest of the series because I really want to read Deathly Hallows."
4,"Scary Spiders, Snakes and Slytherin","This book 2 in the Potter series is a fun, fantastical story of make believe. The tale involves wacky wizardry and witchery as Hogwarts faces a foe unlocked from the Chamber of Secrets after 50 years. The drama threatens Hogwarts very existence and the life of Harry and his friends. Harry will again be thrust into a duel with a deadly foe.The writing is creative and the book is an excellent follow up to book 1. The dangers the kids face seem extreme for an academy and excessive for likes of Dumbledore to abide as headmaster. It seems that the professors at Hogwarts would have a better handle on their domain...snakes, spiders and the unseemly Syltherins seem a bit dark to be given reign."
5,Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets is a great book for all kinds of people, adults and kids! It is the 2nd book in the 7 book series, Harry Potter. Harry is a wizard who's invited to attend Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry. Hogwarts is in a valley by a lake and is enchanted so if a human (wizards call them `Muggles') sees it, it appears as old ruins. Strange attacks are happening at the school and people are becoming petrified. Harry's friend Hermione becomes petrified by a beast called a basilisk. Harry enters the chamber with his friend Ron and professor Lockhart to try and stop the attacks. Will he make it out of the chamber in one piece? This is thrilling all the way through it. If you like mystery and fantasy books, you will love this. I highly recommend it!"
4,Best Book of the Seres,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was the best book of the Seres. J.K Rowling writing just keeps your head in the book. My eyes were in the were book from start to finish. I didnt miss a word while reading it. Harry's second year at hogwarts was the most exiting for hogwarts. Him seeing who should not be named for the first time. And the three headed dog garding the door. It sounded mean. Well I highly recommened this book.
3,Let's Get The Story Started! ... Please ...,"The second book was a slightly deeper than the first. I found myself very frustrated with the first several chapters. Rowling must feel compelled to build artificial review of the first book's concepts and ideas so that readers won't become lost. This makes it somewhat possible to read the second book without having read the first, but why would anyone do that? Tolkien never felt this kind of review was necessary. I think he was able to assume that a reader would be able to bridge between the first and second books without a review. Once we got out of the first chapters, and the story picked up again with the second year, things got better. I've now seen all the movies and they are motivating me forward in the series too. So, I'll keep going for now. I'd give the second book three stars just like the first."
5,not as strong as first book; still a great story,"I thought the ending seemed a little rushed. Too many revelations, and it wasn't as suspenseful as the first book's ending (I haven't read anything as thrilling as the first book's chess scene in a while). Still, this is a great story, perfect for children and adults. Buy it and enjoy!"
5,INFINITY PLUS 2 STARS!,"I think the book was the best book I ever read, and I do read a lot of books! The story was so exciting that you could never, ever put it down because you never know what's going to happen next. And you'll never guess who the Heir of Slytherin is!"
4,HP adn the chamber of secrets,An Entretaining Store por nightwetters.Hey do i hab T9 partiendo Man y Wired? Wired y hay Reding jeje ir
2,overhyped,"I read the first HP and thought. Huh? No big deal. Then I thought maybe I was mistaken and read the second and this is even less of a big deal. OK, I suppose kids with a short attention spann like all those things going on and it's probably great fun for them but as an adult (and after all, all these reviews seem to be from adults)I find it extremely shallow. I think the difference is this: Potters magic relates simply to changing things: this turnesinto that, cars can fly, and so on. But as I said, HP probably greatfor kids, obviously, they love it and I don't want to spoil their fun. But I would advise adults to look futher, deeper: magic isn't just hocus-pocus, abracadabra!"
2,this was not that great,this book put me to sleep by the 2nd chapter i know people think this book was gonna be the greatest thing but I think it was the opposite of that.All these other reviews say how great it was well this one says its not. if u expect it to be as good as the first..you will be dissapointed. its like a long bedtime story
2,Sorcer's Stone 2?,"I really have enjoyed the Harry Potter series, but found the second in the series to be rather uninspired. Felt like a reread of the first. Somewhat of a disapointment sandwiched between two other great books(Stone and Prisoner)."
5,I CAN'T WAIT!,I haven't read this one yet but it looks good. You've gotta read the first one it's the best! I've never wanted anything more than to go to Hogwarts!
5,"Harry Potter is an amazing book, with suspense & adventure!","I am currently reading the book, after first reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It is probably the best book I have ever read. After the first book I didn't think it could get any better. But I was wrong. I just can't get enough of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Proffesor Dumbledore, Hagrid, and all the others."
5,This book is the best book that I have ever read!,"This book is incredible! Harry Potter returns to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and has an even more creative problem than the last! J.K. Rowling explains her story with such detail, and her content is wonderful! I can not say how good this book is! I can not put it in words! I stayed up all night just to find out what happened to Hermione, Ron, and the famous Harry Potter himself!"
5,This is DEFINETLY one of the best books I have ever read!!!,"Harry Potter was a great book. Joanne Rowling tells it with wonderful detail so you can picture it in your mind, like when Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. If you want to read Harry Potter, I would suggest reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone before the Chamber of Secrets. If you read the 2nd book first, you will have NO idea what's going on like who the Dursley's are. This is a book especially for you if you love magic, humor, and wizard. But I'm warning you, if you gross out on stuff easily, be ready for what's coming. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets has quite a bit of gore in it. But it still is an absolutely WONDERFUL book! I know you'll enjoy both of them, and it's much more exciting than math!!!(obviously)"
3,Mantains the Harry Potter magic but nothing is new here...,"I've now read all four Harry Potter books, and I must say that this was the worst. That's not to say it was bad--I still greatly enjoyed reading it. But compared to the other three, it was the worst. The problem is, nothing's new here. The first book had the advantage of being the first. The third and fourth book, you get some serious revelations about his past and the upcoming future. But this book, as I look back on it, is the least of the four. Still, it was enjoyable, and 3 out of 5 seems a fair score."
5,great book!,this is my least favorite book in the series. that being said its still harry potter and an awesome story!!! just buy it!
5,Great one,"After reading the first book I fell in love with the story, its action and mixed fantasy, this one is just another piece of art, one that you can sit and enjoy and understand a little bit more of the world this boy lives in and the things that happen around him, the fantastic and clever ways they have to find out all they want, the way they solve the mysteries..."
5,AWESOME!,I dont have much to say only that this is a really good book and i recomend it to anyone who loves wizirdry and spells and stuff like that I give this book hundreds of stars if i could LOL. i only have one regret about this book and it is that it didnt get 5 stars wich it deserves
4,This book is cool,"The book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an exciting sequel to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone. Harry Potter is in his second year at Hogwarts, school of wizardry. The chamber of secrets has been opened, and someone, or something, is out to get all the non-magic students in the school. At first, everyone thinks the chamber is a myth, but after odd things start happening, people turn into statues, Harry and his friends decide they have to find the chamber, and try to stop whatever is doing this. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventures. I thought it was great. I really enjoyed reading it, and it made me want to read the next one. If you have read the first one, you should definitely read this one."
3,"While clearly a sequel, a good read","It's pretty difficult with any medium to create colorful characters with a crusading plotline. From Stephen King to Luke Skywalker, from old-time westerns to modern-day tv, it's tough to create characters that continually stand up book after movie after magazine with entertaining stories. Our man Harry has perservered through this challenge -- leaving us with a very engaging first novel, The Sorcerer's Stone, and a only mildly less-so sequel.Mild as it may be, the only thing that I found troubling in Chamber of Secrets was its close echo in form, in flavor, to the first book. While hiking a different path, J.K. Rowling climbs the same mountain -- the climax, for instance, is too similar in both books.Considering the audience, though, is not 22 year old readers like myself, this seems like a wholly insufficient reason for anyone younger not to buy this book."
5,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrects,"I can't wait intill the second one comes out I love Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. I never liked to read books, but Harry Potter was so good I couldn't stop."
5,Harry Potter is the best,"Harry Potter's first book tells how he had been pushed around for 10 years, while not knowing that he was a famous wizard even before he could remember. I can't wait for the Chamber of Secrets to come out in bookstores. I'm going to be the first one in line!!!!"
4,Worst than the first one,"I think this book was good, but it repeated a lot of things from the first book. It did not came with so much surprises as the first one either."
5,Harry Potter Book 2,"A classic Harry Potter book. Somehow it was missing from my collection, but now my collection is complete!"
3,Good Condition,"We bought this used and were very please with the condition of the book, the price we paid and the delivery time."
5,*HaRrY PoTTeR*iz so cOoL!!,"I really liked this book because it feels like you can escape reality!!!I also liked this book because its suitable for everyone, its not too kiddish or too mature.In this book the author created a whole new world for wizards and it was so different from the ""muggle"" world..which made it interesting to read!!another thing that makes me like this book is that it doesn't just stop there it continues as he's growing up...and most of all i like this book because it interesting to read and it has a differnt plot unlike other books who have the same plot but change it around alittle."
4,Better than the first one,"Harry Potter is a wizard kid that goes to a magical school. In every book of the series something happens and Harry Potter somehow saves the day using a magic wand and a little help from his friends. In this one, Harry Potter hears voices from the walls of his school, kids get turned to stone, and Harry's friend's little sister finds a magic diary.It's much better than the first book in the series, but it's still written for a very young audience. It's not until Book Three that adults can read this series without constantly rolling their eyes. If you want to get into the series, you'll need to read these early books, but it's all right, they're short, and they go by quickly."
5,A 4th Grade Student Review,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is awesome. This time Harry is blamed for turning kids into statues as if they were frozen. Why? Because he was at the crime scene when everybody saw it. Even a ghost got turned into a statue. I love how the author builds suspense and has a good begining, a good middle and a good ending. Hogwarts was going to be shut down if the attacks didn't stop. And my favorite part is when harry and another friend got a hundred points each for Gryffendor and when Harry's friend is unfrozen and all is saved. But the part I think is most cool is that Gryffendor wins the house cup two years running. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and aren't afraid of snakes.~malady"
5,Christmas gift to pet sitter,"Always love the Harry Potter series. My gift is the beginning of my young friend's experience at HEARING it read by the amazing Mr. Dale. In my view, the books came to life in a much different way from reading it myself. A wonderful experience, that I'm glad to share. I believe that the item was received on time for her to open it during the holiday break. thankss"
4,Harry Potter and the Excellent Set Up for the Future,"I'm gonna be honest.I didn't like this book as much when I first read it.However, after finishing the seventh book, I have found a new respect for this chapter in the Harry Potter series. The Horcruxes become such a large part of the series that, having completed the journey, it is hard to not like this book as much as the others.This is the chapter in the Harry Potter book series that really sets up everything from Ginny to Horcruxes, and it is truly a great chapter in the series. If you don't dig it as much initially, finish the series. You'll know what I mean."
5,Super Cool,"Harry Potter and the Chamver of Seacrets.Is about Harry Potter's second year at hogwartts school of wizardry.Harry and his friend investigate of the chamber of secrets which was clamed to be opened for the second time, and a monster form it to be loosed in the school attacking students.I chose to read this book because i had never read it and it looked interesting. I though the best thing about the book was the monster of the chamber of secrets.I think the author wanted everyone to read this book kids and grownups. I think i will remember the most is what was in the chamber of secrets ."
5,It Rocks,My friend told me that Harry Potter book were fun to read so I read the first book and couldn't put it down. So I read the second one and it is even better than the first. All Harry Potter books are wonderful and to the people that have not read them yet READ THEM NOW! These books are good for all age and I know what some are saying about these books and they are WRONG. So read this book and injoy.
5,Better than the first,"J.K. Rowling weaves a tale of excitement that is pleasing to all ages, young and old alike. She has a charming sense of humor."
5,Bellissimo,"Il libro è troppo bello, soprattutto se si legge nella propria lingua madre!Che gli venisse un colpo a quello che qui sotto ha detto che Hp fa schifo..."
5,Review over harry potter 2,Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets is an exelent book. I would sugest this book to anyone who needs a little magic in their mind. It would be a great book for all kids. I just couldn't put the book down. Every time I tried to stop reading I couldn't i would always be left wondering wat was to come in the pages to come. Like I said this is a great book and I think that everyone should read it.
3,it is not the best book that i have ever read.,harry potter and the chamber of secrets is not as good as number 1.the reason that i only give it 3 stars is because in the middle of the book for like 3 chapters all it does is talk about quidditch.well atleast for a really long chapter.it does have some excitement in the book but i still think that 1 was better. now if you want to read a REALLY good book read goose bumps by r.l. stine
3,Not Too Bad,"I can't tell you how amazed I am at how the kids I have taught have grabbed hold of Harry! I'm glad, because these are well-written, and intensely exciting. Far better to read HP than most of of the other boy-hero books. Harry is not the snide rich kid saves all through rejecting the 'wisdom' of adults kinds of tales (anything Macauley Culkin has ever done, for example).In all, the Harry Potter books are intelligent. For the kids who think the Babysitters Club or Goosebumps are the best the world, start with Harry. Then work your way over on the shelf to read the Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis.Will there be a fifth, sixth or seventh Harry?"
4,Potter returns as Rowling finds her legs,"The Chamber of Secrets is every bit as enjoyable to both younger and older readers as the first Harry Potter adventure. However, this time JK Rowling is starting to find her groove as she weaves a more interesting and intricate plot. However, readers are left with a feeling that this book is just a filler relating the events of Hogwarts' 2nd year without breaking any new ground."
4,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"I think this book was a great book filled with suspence, and thrillers around every corner. A shocking end that will leave your mouth dragging on the floor. There is a fifty foot baskalis (a giant snake)."
5,AWESOME BOOK!,"I loved this book! I could not put it down! I was reading in bed and my mom told me to turn the light out, but I couldn't wait to find out what happens next! I just loved the way the plot twists and turns! In short, I LOVED IT!"
5,AWESOME!!!!!,"This book is so great. I could not put it down. It took me only about three days to read and I'm not even 11. I think it was just as good as HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, maybe even better. This book is awesome. It is suspensful, imaginative, and all around great. J.K. Rowling is one gifted writer."
5,A Fairy Tale like no other!!,"Harry Potter and The Soceror's Stone and Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets are both creative stories you just CAN'T put down. If you need proof, I'll give you proof. In Britian so many adults are reading Harry Potter that now they're making a cover that looks more grown-up looking. Harry Potter has become a household name around my friends and family. I'm positive , if you've read it is a household name for you too."
3,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Book 2),"The Chamber of Secrets continues the development of the characters and basic plot of Harry versus Lord Voldemort, although in this book Voldemort only appears as a memory. It's a good book, but the series doesn't get juicy; i.e., develop its depth until the third book, The Prisoner of Azkaban."
4,R.B.R,I think people who aer deep readers or like Charlie Bone will love Harrry Potter and the Chamber of secrets. For myself my favorite character is the antagonist:Voldemort. I love his character because he's so deadly and sinister.But without Voldemort I think the story would be very quirky.
5,One Word- Awesome!,"This book is wonderfully written so that you can't tell what will happen next, especially when you get to the end. It also makes you wonder if there really is a witch world and we are just Muggles, or if there really is a kid somewhere like the heroic Harry Potter. I think this book had more suspense than the first one Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but I loved that one also. They say that these books are Children's Books, but I do not believe that to be true. Everyone no matter what age will come to love these great stories about the adventures of Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and even to come to dislike Malfoy. The characters in this book are beautifully described so that you can think of people who are exactly like them. I consider Hermoine like myself. J.K. Rowling is a great author and one day I wish to write books as great as her soon-to-be classics."
3,coming in last,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets failed to meet my expections after reading Harry Potter and the soccercers stone. It was a book with the same thrilling aspects of Harry Potter and the socceror's stone and Harry Potter and the prisonor of Azcaban, but didn't leave you with same ""I want to read this again and agian feeling""."
5,Great Book!!,"I really enjoyed this book because of all the adventure,mystery , and excitement! I read this and almost couldn't put it down! I would recommend this book if you like adventure, mystery, and excitement around every corner! I can't wait to read the 3rd Harry Potter book!"
2,DON'T READ,"I'm sorry, but what's all the fuss about! This book is dull, and suggests that people are bad, against wizards, who are good. I personally suggest the Redwall book series by Brian Jaques. His books are much better, and more exciting. I also suggest Madeline L'Engle, and C.S. Lewis's books."
1,Disturbing,"I will not let my children read this book. There certainly is a big 'rave' about this series of books, but the influence and ideas it will give children is quite distrubing. There are many books out there that captivate children's minds without witches and the such. Children are what they think, they think based upon what they read.The book itself was very captivating, which is awesome for children, but the content which captivated them is scary.Potter's imagination is awesome, I hope the author will write more books, just on another caliber."
1,Not a book for children.,"We have read this book and feel it has no place in the hands of children. This book is at best an introduction into witchcraft.It reaches out to children with tales of sorcery and spells. It glorifies revenge.It puts down family values and their concept. The main character's parents are blown up and murdered. The book states that ""Death is the next Great Adventure"". This book is close to being banned in 5 states and rightfully so.Our children in this day in age need to embrace family values and be taught to treasure life."
1,Sacriligious Heretical Garbage,"I got two words for you: Terrible book.Need I say more. Harry Potter is an infidel and terrible role model for today's youth. This book is a pure waste of time and further more, it should not be allowed to be read by children - or anybody for that matter - due to its magic, witchcraft, atheist propaganda as well as for its sheer lack of literary value.Read something of real value - like Shakespeare - my mistake - that's probably a little too cultivated for Harry Potter readers.Don't waste your time with this - pure torture."
5,Better than the first,My son and I had a great time with this book! I thought it was even better than the first.
2,Very Disappointing,"Asked for a new book, paid a new book price, but received something far from it. The book has clearly been read a few times. Dirty, Torn binding, creases in the outer cover, and what looks like Kool-aid stains on the pages. Delivery was slow as well. I am not happy."
1,Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets,Very disappointing. This looks nothing like the original hardback book. I have the original paperback and was hoping to obtain a hardback version so my son could have the collection. This book is not only child size but cheeply made with thin paper. It is of no use to me and will propably through it in the trash. Words cannot explain how disappointed we are.
2,WHADDYA NUTS??,OK YA OK ITS SUPPSED A BE A KIDS BOOK YA GOT DEAD CATS HANGIN FROM TORCHES PEOPLE VOMITING SLUGS AND BEING TURNED INSIDE OUT DECAPITATED DEAD PEOLE HAVING A PARTY WITH OTHER DEAD PEOPLE AND A GHOST THAT LIVES IN A TOILET YA OK THIS IS EDIUCATIUONAL READING NOT FOR KIDS ITS STUPID AND DUMB DID I SAY STUPID OH YA ITS NOT FOR KIDS ITS LIKE DEVIL WORSHIP 101 FOR KIDS I MEAN COME ON HOW STUPID IS THIS ITS GARBAGE TWO STARS FOR SOME TRIPPY PARTS
1,"Great book, terrible reading","I have read all the Harry Potter books and loved them all. My husband read the first one and we decided to get the next one on CD to listen to because he enjoyed the book but hates reading. Jim Dale, the reader on this set, was awful! He makes all the child characters sound whiny and down right dumb. It was near torture to get through this entire book on CD. I cannot for the life of me understand why there was a grammy nomination for this reading. It was almost like nails on a blackboard. For the next one, we will shell out the extra money to get the Stephen Fry version."
3,Customer Review,The product appears to be okay. I think the next time I would buy new. Outside packaging was not what I expected.
4,Review,Great book. I am enjoying this series more than I thought I would. I am looking forward to book three.
4,POTTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS BOOK IS A PRETTY GOOD BOOK.I LIKE THE CHARACTERS AND THE ROLES THEY PLAY.THE BOOK IS VERY INTERESTING AND IT KEPT ME INTO IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME.I LIKE THE WAY THE AUTHOR MAKES THE STORY LINE AND HAS MANY EXCITING MOMENTS.I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ENJOY REDING ON A RAINY DAY, BECAUSE YOU WILL GET WRAPPED UP INTO IT FOR A GOOD WHILE.JASON---AGE 14"
5,Chamber of Secrets book,The product was as advertised and arrived as scheduled. It suits the purpose for which it was ordered. Definitely would order again.
5,Amazing,"Addicting, and absorbing. I could not put this book down for more than five minutes. Absolutely positively, magnificently, beautifully brilliant."
4,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,This is a great book. I have read it before. Can't wait to read the next one! Hope the series continues to get better and better.
4,Great clamp set,"This miter clamp set is a one of a kind gettup that is well suited for it's duty. It does the job as it's supposed to and aids it setting the perfect miter. The only thing I would like to see are a set of clamps that are closer together for smaller miters on base mouldings. All in all, this set is well worth the money if you plan on doing a large project."
1,They Have a Point -- Literally!,"I did quite a bit of research looking for a clamping system for picture frames. Time and again I came back to Ulmia and decided to give them a try. They look good but simply do not work on the woods I tested them on: maple, oak, pine, purple heart and cherry. The springs have nail-sharp points on them that, when clamped with the lightest pressure I could and still hold the mitre, punched varying holes and gouges in the wood. I even tried one on the nice wooden box they were shipped in and it dug into the side. (Did the return department notice that?)I'm not sure what application one would use where gouging the wood is an acceptable part of clamping. For me, the Ulmia design is ""Duh!"" What do you get when you press sharp, hardened steel into wood? I should have figured that one out before wasting the time buying and returning it."
4,Cascades,"E. W. Richardson moves from his highly successful war poetry to love and those who love. In this new and delightful book, his work expands into that nearing the work of masters. His style is one of keen comfort, giving readers great returns on their investment.If Richardson's titles were priced individually, none could afford these treasures, But, within its pages, Cascades, serves up bon bons of sweet romantic verse, along with surprises hidden throughout this book of treats."
5,A great read,So glad to see Mr. Richardson's second effort at last. The strength of his craft continues to shine. Will be looking for his next effort with great anticipation.
2,Only rain and Sea wave sound but no excitement,I got down this CD last week from Amazon As I am having DTS equipment's that I bought this to listen to DTS. But you get only raining and sea wave sound for the whole length of the CD no sound flowing one end to the other no base involved giving no excitement its just raining and get boring.
1,Cosmic Farce,"Take 4 Parts Moody Blues on Drugs, 4 Parts The Monkeys and Mix in liberaly mass quantities of Spinal Tap at their hilarious worst and Shake not stir while recording in your garage with an old 8 track stereo and you have the disaster this disc has tuned out to be! ... Oh well! Actually if the music wasn't trying to be so pretentious it might actually make a novelty album fit for Dr. Demento. Take my advice get the Moody Blue's 'Days of Future Passed' and pass on this horrible mistake, you'l be glad you did, believe me!"
5,The Storm,Entirely pleased with service from this vendor. CD arrived in excellent condition and plays like new.
5,About Time!,"Travis has been my favorite performer for quite some time and this is a sound I always wished to hear from him.I was envisioning some Kenny Wayne Shepard bluesy influence throughout and then he finishes with his cover of Someday, somehow, somewhere. Excellent!As a side note, if you ever have a chance to see him live, take it, as he is flawless live!Two thumbs up for album and style, but a couple of the ballads are a little slow."
4,great fence rider album from a guy who deserves to stick around!,"Tritt is one of the last great voices in country music. The power brokers in Trashville, TN have bastardized the genre so bad, Im not even sure I'd want to be labeled ""Country"" these days. Travis rides the fence between pablum spewing radio fare and genuine american music with this collection. The title track is far and away the best tune, worthy of being called Southern Rock (a few steps musically above country in both execution and musicality). The ghosts of Duane Allman, Waylon, Otis Redding and Chet Atkins can all find something to smile about. Bravo Travis, bravo."
2,The Storm - Travis Tritt,"Very disappointed with the new CD. It has more of a rock beat than country. There is a touch of blues on some of the songs, which isn't too bad. However, I would not recommend anyone to purchase this CD."
2,Disappointed,"Have always been a Tritt fan, but this album didn't have anything that makes it stand out from other country rock singers. Nothing special."
1,"14k Yellow Gold 4mm Italian SuperFlex Herringbone Chain Necklace, 20""","MADE IN ITALY.Amazon mangled (badly bent and dented) this necklace when they packed it into the presentation box. There were clips that were supposed to hold the necklace in place and they had been torqued down way too tightly on the necklace causing major crimps in the ""ribbon of gold""!! Whoever packed it, destroyed it!!Box was cheap and bottom bowed outwards so that it did not sit flat on a table. Blue velvet looked very worn in spots. One cardboard piece inside the box had fallen off the rusty metal interior. Looked like it had been glued years ago with a hot glue gun that didn't hold. I had to throw out the box and come up with something presentable myself.Necklace is wide, but very, very thin and it gets dented very easily! (see above) Yes, it has a nice, shiny yellow color, but it is very fragile! Maybe that's to be expected when buying jewelry online for a low cost?"
2,Good but not as good as Trance to the Sun,I want to like Cocteau Twins but they just come short of what the band Trance to the Sun does. TTTS is everything Cocteau Twins wishes they were.
4,"Rightfully, though perhaps a little too gently, continues legacy","Short album which continues to articulate that singular Cocteau aesthetic, composed between the shimmering guitars and ethereal female vocals found lingering throughout. Opening with some of their most obvious beauty, it becomes noticeable somewhere through the middle of this album that the haunting melodic sense which usually provides staggering counterpoint to this vocalist seems underdeveloped, sometimes taking their minimal approach down a partially mechanical route, but nearly everything becomes salvaged with exceptional production values for the time highlighting the many facets to this diamond-like music. In the final few songs, the Twins again justify another album experience with greater consuming dynamics, making Victorialand yet another snap-shot of a sound long lost."
3,Good. The vocals have some echo which dimishes them.,"I just bought this album and have listened to it three times. The songs are on average a bit low-keyed compared to some of their more rockin' albums. Ohter than this, my only complaint is that the vocals have some echo effect that diminishes the clarity of them. They lose some of the aural bite that is present on other albums. Overall, I would recommend this album to any fans of the group. The songs are unique from other songs they have recorded."
5,A Masterpiece--one of my favourite albums,"This is an album of simple beauty, full of dark moments, melancholy, and bliss from lack of sleep. Overall it has a sombre effect, even the ""happy"" pieces are tinted with a wintery dullness of colour. I love this album, and is a classic in my mind. I do disagree however with the previous reviewer. I see nothing of the Baroque in this album. There is none of Baroque's restraint of emotion. I'd personally liken it more to Erik Satie's ""Gymonpedies"" or Claude Debussy's more bittersweet, lyrical pieces. This album has a simple lushness that can be appreciated universally."
5,Awsome Spanish couisine cookbook,"I have not found many Spanish cookbooks that do justice and compare to my mother's cooking. This one is an exception. It is as authentic as it gets. The recepies for ropa vieja, arroz con pollo, and paella are very good and taste as good as my mother's."
4,I really like...............,"I am slowly becoming a fan of Ms. Bush. I know this is an old book and most of you have already read it. I found it quite entertaining. Jane Kelly has not reached Stephanie Plum standards, but I have faith she will get there. ( Although Stephanie is getting a little tiresome. :) )"
2,Not like Stephanie Plum: Over-Written,"This is NOT a Stephanie Plum-type novel. Do not be misled by the blurb on the jacket.Bush's writing doesn't have the zing of Evanovich's stories, and the first-person narrative from the heroine is full of long descriptive passages detailing how someone's yard looks or what kind of food is being eaten. The dialogue is fine, but there's simply not enough of it to make up for the long descriptive passages detailing what kind of room the narrator is in and what things are hanging up in it. The long passages made it hard for me to stay interested in the pedestrian plot (sorely lacking in action and dialogue), and I ended up skipping the last 100 pages to get to the ending.I will not read another book in this series, but will read the next Evanocich book. I like my humorous heroines to have more of a sense of humour!"
2,NOT GOOD AS STEPHANIE PLUM BOOKS,"This book is very light reading, a slow moving story with boring characters. The best character in the book was the dog Binky, and that's sad. It is not as interesting or enjoyable as a Stephanie Plum novel. The story line has potential, but not fully developed. Buy this book discount only, not worth full price money."
1,bad service,Have never received this book. No responses from emails I have sent to seller. Worst service I have ever received on Amazon. Will file a formal complaint.
2,Extremely disappointing,"I too was suckered into this book by the Stephanie Plum quote on the front cover. As the author seemed to be targetting Plum fans I expected a similar exciting and hilarious read. Wrong!Jane Kelly is boring. And worse than that, she's not even funny. Where Janet Evanovich has me laughing out loud Nancy Bush had me sighing in frustration.The plot was okay but predictable. The biggest flaw in this book was that the characters were impersonal and unlikeable. I'll probably read the second one and give her a chance to improve."
3,unique tool for specific porblems,"the tool seem to be useful for very specific roof applications. I found it be cumbersome. Built well, will last"
4,toe tapper,"It's hard to keep your feet still with the bouncy rhythms on this CD. It isn't new music, but that's what the title says - it's 50's music. If you have to have 'original artists', then this isn't for you. If you like instrumentals with a beat, this is a fun collection (and I think it's the best of the superpickers series.) I wish they had more like this."
1,A lie on two counts...,"They're not from Nashville. The CD was recorded in Ocala, Florida. And there's no way anybody in their right mind could call them ""Superpickers."""
5,couldn't put it down,"Paula McLain's account of her childhood is compelling reading. I am deeply concerned with the dismal state of the foster care system and the impact of it on our community's children. I have also been a foster parent. Ms. McLain's writing is powerful and personal, a beautiful and touching memoir allowing the rest of us to experience the abysmal consequences of parenting taken too lightly (by biological parents or misguided fosters or officials entrusted with responsibility). The reader does not have to have a specific interest in this topic to be moved and gain value and insight. Ms. McLain takes full responsibility as an adult to have her own life work, even with the vestiges of her childhood forever present. No whining here, which makes it all the more powerful. A quick read, highly recommended."
1,Video - Through the Tunnel & Beyond,"Ordered this item October 16, 2001. Still have not received it. It would be nice to receive it before Christmas.I Would love to review it but it seems the World's Largest Inventory is having trouble obtaining this video, even though they still have it for sale on their web site."
2,BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL,"This is your classic D grade trash movie, and a guilty pleasure. This time Ginty's back & after a scummy street gang with the aid of his garbage truck arsenal. Definately better than the first movie, and actually quite fun."
2,Retread of the original but with less impact,"This is less a sequel to the original than a remake of it .Robert Ginty -giving another solid performance -is once again out to clean up the streets of 1980's New York and this time around he arms himself with a flame thrower and operates out of an armoured garbage truck .His special attention is devoted to ""X "" a street gang leader with delusions of grandeur -he sees himself as an almost Messianic figure ,out to unite the street gangs so as to make them more organised and powerfulThis role is played with some style and a certain tongue in cheek quality by Mario Van Peebles nut , despite this and other decent performances the picture does not make the impact of its predecessor.The budget allows for more and noisier explosions and shootouts this time around but there is little freshness or originality ,and you get a somehat more pyrotechnically advanced version of the superior originalRecommended to vigilante movie completists only"
2,"Burn, baby, burn...",Personally I have never seen the first Exterminator film but after seeing the second one it is not on my priority list. I've seen a lot of Golan-Globus films such as Death Wish 3 and 4 ( because my older brother Eric owns them all)but this is one of the worst. Some of the punks in this movie seem like the ones in other Golan-Globus films. I like Van Peebles as X and the ending rocks otherwise this is a movie just to rent.
1,Torch This One!,"Say what you will about James Glickenhaus' original, at least he appeared to be TRYING to make a decent film. This sequel is so ineptly made that it cannot even qualify as a guilty pleasure. One interesting aspect is that most of the ""Exterminator's"" action scenes are performed with a mask on--I wonder if Robert Ginty was even in these scenes? As for the scenes he did appear in..."
1,PC would never boot with this installed.,"Couldn't get it to work, my PC never would boot with it pluged in. Pass on this, I'm glad I'm only out five bucks."
5,It's A Snap,How much can one say? This card installed flawlessly and requires no driver installation (must have XP SP1 at minimum). Had it up and working < 5 minutes. No problems to report since.
5,Works great,"Ordered this for a 2000 Gateway computer.Well, to keep it simple, I plugged it in, and Windows 98 recognized the card and installed the drivers automatically. Flash drive was recognized showing the card worked. Couldn't be happier as to how easy it was to install and how the card was compatible with older computers. Thanks Belkin, nice to have something work right on that computer for a change!"
5,Solved A Knotty USB Problem!,"For some time now I have been plagued with an issue where, whenever an external USB drive was connected to my computer, I could not even make it past the memory-countup in POST.I searched the tech sites looking for an answer, and found *MANY* other people with the same problem (as near I can tell it is certain chipsets on motherboards - by many different manufacturers - which cause the issue), but no answer.UNTIL - I _finally_ found a site where a poster wrote that he had solved this problem by merely installing an el cheapeaux generic USB PCI-card and plugging his external drives into it.I spent the pocket change to buy this card and *voila* (or Viola, if you're more musically inclined): PROBLEM SOLVED!I can now boot with any number of USB drives attached and the system no longer hangs before it can POST. Like many such computing annoyances, it was simple to fix but long in the solving. I couldn't be happier than I am with this card. :o)"
5,works great,Fast and works great..on time and met all of our expectations. Saved us money on a new computer. Thanks so much.
3,did not seem to be high speed,"it did work and I needed another uSB port, it is advertized to be hi-speed but program did not recognize it as a hi-speed port, so that part disapointed me but it does work and will have to do as I am not sure what speed a hi-speed port goes"
3,decent card but take note.....,"easy to install. works great except it does not wake from sleep on a mac. I have a wireless usb adapter plugged into this card. When I wake the computer from sleep mode the card does not wake with it, therefore I cant connect to my wireless router."
5,Easy to install,"I needed more USB ports on my old Windows XP 32-bit system and this card has solved my problem. Works perfectly, truly plug-and-play."
3,Uninspired story which is agood read,"The usual British plot of a son who does not agree with his father that the Royal Navy is the be all and end all of professions. The protagonist serves as an officer in the Merchant Marine whose father is part of the Royal Naval Reserve as a merchant officer and moves to serve in the Navy. His son disagrees and remains in the Merchant Marine. Good plot dealing with South America and German Naval Presence and Auxillaries during the early days of the war. A good read, but not truely unexpected in its plot and the results. More of a light reading recreation book than one for the serious reader looking for a compulsie page turner. It took me 10 days to finish this book. Normally I finish a page turner in 2 days. Read, enjoy, but dont expect excellance"
5,This is a brilliant Restoration Comedy.,"I recently reread this play for the third time and taught it in a British Literature survey at the University of Texas. Not only do I find it more entertaining and more brilliant with every reading, but I was shocked to find that the vast majority of my students really enjoyed it and preferred Wycherley to Shakespeare. If you want a smart, hilarious, and dark comedy that plumbs the depths of jealousy and sexual possession, this is a must-read play. If you're easily offended or have a hard time following complicated plots and catching bawdy puns, you'll certainly want to avoid it."
5,Loved the play,"No, I haven't read the book. I saw the play put on by The Shakespeare Theater in Washington. Tessa Auberjonois was an absolute darling in the title role; you couldn't help but feel glad for Margery's odd-but-happy ending.If Wycherley was no Shakespeare, he did this sort of play better than the Bard. Nothing is quotable, the characters are one dimensional and only the ""China"" scene got real laughs. But Wycherley did a neat and nasty take on Restoration mores and made it enjoyable, too."
1,Why is there not a no star rating?,"This is BAD. If you have to read this book for a class, I'm sorry. If you are looking for pleasure reading, SAVE YOURSELF! There is still time! This is a half-baked farce with no depth and not enough humor to carry it. BAD."
2,Witty yet ultimately shallow,"I have to study this play for my 'A'-levels, and would like to inform readers that this play is NOT worth reading. It is filled to bursting with sexual innuendo and crude, cheap jokes. There are main issues that could be brought out, such as deception, relationships and the function of society, but Wycherley fails to ever reach any firm moral standing on any of these points. The play is ultimately hollow of its concepts and is certainly not worth the effort."
4,Very useful in France,"The Metroguide software for France is more useful than the US version. The maps seem more up to date, and, due to the difficulty of finding anything in France, much more useful. I managed to find our company's new building in a new town by punching in the address, and I was able to use my emap to find it in 10 minutes from the train station. It also seems to have up to date restaurant and attraction info for Paris and other areas."
1,DO NOT BUY! - OUTDATED PRODUCT,"I made the mistake of ordering this product along with a new Garmin Etrex Vista a week before a UK trip. Garmin does not sell it any more. It's a WINDOWS 95, 98, NT 4.0 product. Not even NT 4.1, not less Windows 2000 or XP. The packaging mentions only GPSes that Garmin used to sell, none that they currently sell. It's a 1999 product, based on 1995 map data. ALL of the products with a European country name in them (France, Great Britain, etc) are OUTDATED! DO NOT BUY! See the Garmin site.Garmin will charge you ...plus shipping to upgrade to the current product, which Amazon doesn't even appear to sell. Even this offer expires on August 31, then you are completely stuck.In short, I trusted Amazon to know their stuff, and they cheated me. I guess they laid off their GPS guru. Very surprised and disappointed."
1,Do not buy! Out of date and unsupported.,Garmin do not make this any more. All the European maps have been combimed into a single CD package.
4,Caitie's Book Review,"I'll Be Seeing You is a very interesting book filled with mystery and suspense. Clark's main character, Meghan, is a successful young newscaster. Meghan is very close to her parents, and when her father - and his car- disappears in a fatal car accident she is devastated. The authorities can't find any evidence that Meghan's father was killed in the car accident, so the only conclusion they can come to is that he faked his own death. Meghan wants to get to the bottom of it, but when she begins to investigate for clues to where her father could be, strange things start happening. This is a great book for readers who like mysteries with unsuspected killers and hidden motives."
3,Clark captures-but not this time,"I've read nothing but Clark books since picking up ""Where are the Children"" two months ago. However after ""I'll be seeing you"" my passion for her writing will diminish slightly. Not as exciting as the last seven I've read. Clark is a great writer, but you'd be better served to pick up ""Loves Music, Loves to Dance"" or ""Let me call you Sweetheart."""
5,this book is so AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,this is so good i can't belive how drawn in a got. i was so shocked at the ending of this book it i read this book in the 7th gade and it was a book you could take a test on and get points and it was worth 16 so i read and now i haven't stoped!
5,A MUST READ,"I have read a few of Mary Higgin Clark's books beforehand, but this book is one of the best I have read. It is very suspenseful and keeps you on your toes throughout the whole novel. The descriptions of the characters and places are very vivid so the reader is able to visualize what exactly is going on. This book kept me wondering what is going to happen next and I didn't want to stop reading. This book is a must read. You never know what's going to happen next in this book."
4,A TOTAL KNOCK OUT!!!,"I am 16 years old and I selected this book for a high school summer reading book. I usually hate reading books but I got into this book and like it. I heard nothing but great remarks about Mary Higgins Clark. The fact about she lives in New Jersey(by me) and usually has a setting in the books around that area really intrigues me. It is great reading something that I can get a feel for the environment that it takes place in. Mary Higgins Clark has a unique way of writing...she has different thoughts and feelings the characters are displaying. Throughout the book, there is an unsettling excitement feeling about being the detective and finding out the mystery. ...Is Edwin Collins really dead?"
4,A good mystery.,"Mary Higgins Clark has done it again with this suspenseful novel which focuses on Meghan Collins and her desperate search to find the truth about her father while at the same time she's trying to solve the murder of someone who looks like her. At the same time, she uncovers the secrets of the Manning Clinic, which specializes in invitro fertilization. She is a reporter who is searching for the truth while a stalker is constantly watching her. However, I believe that the author should have added at least one more chapter at the end so that we know what happens to some of the main characters. Overall, if you're a fan or just like to play detective, this is definitely an interesting story."
3,Ok at Best,Some of my favorite books have been written by MHC - this is not one of them. It was slow paced and somewhat predictable. Just not up to her usual standards. There were a couple good twists so I did manage to finish it but not without much effort.
3,Not My Favorite,This book was not the best book that she has written. It took me awhile to get into it. It started out very slowly and didn't pick up until almost the middle of the book. It still was a little slow and I had a hard time staying interested. I would not be interested in reading this book again.
4,Great for reluctant female readers,"Mary Higgins Clark writes a pretty good mystery, and all her heroines wear GREAT clothes. What more does a teenage girl need to captivate her? Add in short chapter lengths, a handsome male suitor that is devoted to the protagonist, and a few harrowing twists and turns, and this book is almost irresistable for a young reader.No, it doesn't qualify as a literary masterpiece, but it definitely can prove to a kid why reading CAN be enjoyable. And for adults, I can think of worst ways to ""escape"" than with a good, easy mystery."
2,Sacroiliac Belt,"I've used this belt before for SI problems that put me down for about six weeks. The belt helps so much (paired with home exercise) and I ran the Napa Marathon after four weeks of being on the belt. The only problem: while the belt helps to support the SI and surrounding tendons, the IT (iliotibial band that runs down the sides of your legs) doesn't receive the support of your back because it's being cut off from the belt. After recovering from SI, I began suffering from IT in both legs which put me down another three weeks. Use the belt in moderation, focus more on home exercise and building your core - that will strengthen and support your SI without having to use the belt so much."
1,Terrible,As much as I love Farrah Fawcett this was by far her worst movie ever. I couldn't finish it. It was that BAD. If you are looking for a good Farrah movie this one is not it. Try Burning Bed. AWESOME MOVIE. This one not so much.
3,mmovie review,"I ordered two movies. One was great, and one was faulty. I`m still waiting to see if I`ll be charged for the replacement movie. Thanks, Martha"
1,"Worst, impossible...","This film is one of the worst that I never saw. Be careful, because the same artist, Farrah Fawcett, made another film, related with domestic violence that is a clasic and you don't have to loose it: The Burning Bed."
1,Extemities,I am highly dissatisfied with the purchase of this dvd (extemities)I dont know what format this movie is in and it does not play on any of my dvd or blueray player and I would like a refund.
5,classic,another great 80s flick...gonna try and find this one again....maybe on ebay great film...i do miss the 80s..farrah is great in this movie my favorite movie of hers
4,very good condition and received it as stated.,"I just wanted to have a Farrah Faucett movie in my collection. I was a fan and I think this is one of the best movies she's ever done. In my opinion it's much better than ""The burning bed!"" The dvd was in great condition eventho the case wasn't, that didn't matter to me."
1,Did I miss something???,"I saw this a few nights ago on regular late night tv, so maybe it was edited to death and I missed all the interesting parts???? All I know is that it seemed highly unbelievable... Spoilers follow....(...why does the rapist just walk in her front door...would you leave your door unlocked if you had just been attacked and the rapist had your driver's license?!!) Anyways...I couldn't get past that part through the whole movie, so maybe that's what made me hate it. I do have to give kudos to Farah Fawcett though, her acting was excellent and seemed very genuine...maybe she has been through some similar trauma in real life?"
2,Not happy...,"Okay, is Hilary Duff turning into clone? In this CD, all the songs are dance! She says she wouldn't want to abandon her younger audience, yet I hear all this and even hear a bad word in between! Okay, yeah, some kids may have girlfriends or boyfriends(I do!) but that's not what life is about and that's all Hilary says! UGH! Someone help us...(and her!)"
1,BEWARE,"Its unfortunate that I can't enjoy this CD on my I-Pod. The enhanced features prevent me from downloading the songs onto my computer. BEWARE!!! Do not buy the CD if you plan to download the songs onto your computer, because its likely that you'll experience difficulties and I'd rather you avoid the misery I've been placed in. You would think that Hollywood Records would have learned from the Sony Music debacle."
5,Blast to the past,"I remember I got this in 2007 when it first came out for my birthday. I bugged my aunt to get it for me for weeks so for my birthday she surprised me and got it! I have been a huge fan of Hilary Duff since her Lizzie McGuire days so I had to get this album. I don't know where it is now so I'm gonna re-purchase it. This album is pure perfection. Every song is so unique and Hilary's voice sounds flawless. My favorite songs are Stranger, Gypsy Woman, and Play With Fire. Hilary was and is still such an inspiration and I can't wait for future music from her."
5,Good CD,"This CD is good. My personal favorite CD of Hilary's is her 2nd, self titled, one: ""Hilary Duff"". But yeah this one is really good! It is more mature but not in like a sluty way like some stars tend to do when they get older.My favorite songs are: Stranger, Dignity, With Love, Happy, and Play with Fire. But actually all of them are really good. And Hilary was part of the writing process for each of the songs on this album. I the past she hasn't written her own songs. But this time she did, not alone of course. But it is all her and it is definately worth the buy!Oh and I love her new look with brown hair, she really looks great!"
4,"""NO COMMENT""","I love hilary duff don't get me wrong but i notice in all her CD's execpt metemorphsis she has a couple and when i say couple i mean like ....3 good songs on this CD ""with Love"" is pretty much a popular one but some of the others not so good...i di'nt buy this CD mainly for the music i like hilary duff so what can i say..."
4,Hilary Goes Pop!,"On her latest CD, Hilary Duff changes course from the pop rock of last CDs and heads to the dance floor with beat driven electric pop. The result is a fun album that shows growth in Hilary as an artist and writer yet still exhibits a youthful innocence appropriate to her age. Writing all but one of the songs , this is Hilary's most personal album. There are songs about her break up with her rocker boyfriend(Stranger, Happy), her stalker (Dreamer) and the teen tabloid queens of her generation( Dignity). These songs show a strong, straight talking mature Hilary ready to speak her mind.Yet for me the best songs on the CD are the upbeat,meant to be fun songs like Never Stop,With Love, Dignity, Outside of You and Playing With Fire.All things considered a first rate Cd from an underrated artist who is maturing without exploiting her self like so many of her peers. Pick it up and enjoy!"
3,some songs are good,"some songs are good on this cd. its differnt then her other music but it is still good. if you are a big fan of hilary Duff, then git it!"
5,Awsome cd!,This cd rocks! Hilary duffs best work yet! My favorite songs are 1.) Gypsy Woman2.) Stranger3.) DignityDefinatly worth the money!
2,Not Impressed,"Hilary Duff has left the music that made her a star for dance music that fails to please. I had never really listened to her until I heard the song ""Fly"" from her sophomore ablum ""Hilary Duff"" and I instantly fell in love with her. While I am not saying that her 2 previous ablums were perfect they were much better than this! She left songs with actual meaning and sings things with lovely lyrics like this: ""You got the hottest shoes (You got it) You got those Jimmy Choo's (You got it)"" THESE ARE LYRICS FROM THE TITLE SONG TO HER ABLUM!!!!! I don't understand where she is trying to take her career, but I will not follow."
1,More of the sad american fate,"I used to be a huge Hilary Duff (still am sort of) I watched lizzie Mcgwire (i forgot how to spell it ; . ;) everyday and have her part two albums. But when i saw the music video for 'with love' This non-mainstream-music-non-prep girl couldn't watch it all. It was to much dance preppy cherrleader ness to it. Not my thing. There are two options Hilary can take now, either bounce back with an album with songs like 'come clean' (metamorphosis) and 'Fly' (Hilary Duff) or she can retire and stick to acting"
5,"""Dignity"" is great!","""Dignity"" is great! Another great album from Hilary Duff.Track Listing1. Stranger2. Dignity3. With Love4. Danger5. Gypsy Woman6. Never Stop7. No Work, All Play8. Between You And Me9. Dreamer10. Happy11. Burned12. Outside Of You13. I Wish14. Play With Fire"
3,Dignity is Decent...,"...Hilary didnt quite take the Britney Spears route or the Mandy Moore route but surprisingly took the Kylie Minogue route and it works. I dont like the beat for stranger or tune but the words are good, but with dignity then the album really takes off, then you get with love, danger, all work, no play, i wish, play with fire, dreamer and a really good dance pop album-I much prefer this direction for Hilary."
5,LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I own this cd,and it is my favorite of all cds.I have about 15 cd's,and this will always be my favorite!My dad got it for me as an Easter present because I love Hilary duff.Dignity is probably her best album.i love it.my suggestion is to buy it.ESPECIALLY if you're a big Hilary Duff fan like me!You'll love this album,I wouldn't lie."
2,This album is sad :-(,"Okay..where do I start? I also sampled songs on iTunes and they all sound the same! How many dance songs can you put on just ONE CD? I mean, let's hear something original! Not only that, but if she ""doesn't want to abandon that (children) audience"", why are all of her songs about love? She even says a word that parents might not want their kids to hear. I've been more and more dissapointed in Hilary Duff through out these few years. :-( <sad face."
2,A Major Letdown,"I first enountered Hilary Duff when my wife purchased her cd's for my daughters. The music was great. Catchy pop songs that everyone, old and young,could enjoy. HOwever, I believe she has waisted her talents on this cd. It appears she has attempted to conform to the mainstream of all other young female singers. One would have hoped that she would have held out and continued to make catchy songs, instead of going for the club music. In my opinion, the club music is for those without talent. She has to much talent for that. Therefore, I do not reccomend this cd."
1,This CD Stinks!!!!,"I didn't even buy this CD, but i sampled the songs on iTunes. The songs are all dance music. There's nothing wrong whith dance music, but how many dance songs can you put on 1 CD??!! The songs are all about LOVE & are not appropriate for young children. I admitt I used to be a Hilary Duff fan, but times change. I don't recommend this CD!!!"
1,hilary duffs silly fluff,"shes a millionaire thanks to preteens.considering even preteens like to listen to ''music'',this garbage is no different from the next mtv creation.all image/style,no substance.i am so fortunate to have lived when music was real."
5,Buy this game now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I don't have this game yet But I'm going to!!!How many days does it take to ship it to me!Okay now where to start.First you start as a maybe 18 to 20 year old womanyou have a job you work 9 to 5 you see an add about a great farm you buy it then you pack and go there the mayor laght at you. you hit him with a hammer then he belives you you press yes thenyou start the game! So first you with a young puppy when it grows up it will scare the wild dogs away!(Buy it at Amazon it is a low price I think!) You get to mine in the Spring Mine any season and winter mine only in winter because the path has water and the water needs to be frozen to walk on the ice. You can buy animals and lots lots lots more like getting married( It's a great offer) You will play it for hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you need a game boy advance! DUDE!!!! I love love love it! I going to marry Docter! Bye Bye
4,Great game!,"This is great game, if you want to do anything,there are spelling errors,but still a great game.You get to get married, raist a farm lol, buy stuff,ship stuff, own pets horses,cows, chickens that can die if you take care of them, etc. I would recommend it completey, but thats just me. Take a chance its great."
3,Addictive at first,"This game is hard to let go of when you start, however as it progresses you'll have to keep on doing the same things over and over again. While repetitiveness is unavoidable in a game like this, you'll get bored of this game in the long run."
4,Great Game,"Having bought and enjoyed HM:FoMT, I was devastated when, in the fifth year of the game, it broke. I think that the built in lithium battery broke, because it deleted my previous game, and would not let me save a new one. So when I heard about the release of HM:MFoMT, I was really happy and asked for it for my birthday. I like how they change the introduction, and how you can now date and marry all the characters you were previously competing against. It gives you a great new perspective. I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the previous games. I am slightly disappointed that it doesn't seem like you can connect to the first Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life. Other than that, I'm really pleased with this game."
5,Great Game!!,"This GBA game is a great choice for a girl, because, I have to say, it's kind of weird to give a bunch of presents and marry a girl when you ARE a girl. I have the DS game, and if you insert the GBA Friends of Mineral Town or More Friends of Mineral Town, the people from Mineral Town can visit. It's totally fun! Go ahead and buy it! It's a great purchase!"
4,This is a great game!!,"Harvest Moon : MFoMT is awsome! There is a lot to do and you will have many hours of fun playing it. I most warn you though : this is a very addicting game! People of all ages will fall instantly in love with this game. I don't like that every year the festivals are the same though. You can marry any of the five eligable bachlores. Getting married and having a family are fun.Girls will like this HM game because you play a girl character. Boys might like Harvest Moon: Friends of mineral town better because you play a boy character.This game is probably best for ages 8 and up. They can understand it better than younger kids , but that's just my opinion.I hope that after reading this review, you will go to your local gaming store and pick up a copy of Harvest Moon : More Friends of Mineral Town."
4,"Fun, but nothing too new for the series.","Its a fun game, but unfortunately there's nothing to new to it.The thing I like it that you start out with a chicken coop and a barn, so you can get animals fast, but it's almost too easy in that respect. The dialogue is MUCH better than DS Cute. It's basically HM Back to Nature, except you're a girl."
2,'preposterous'?,"I approached this book with anticipation, and looked forward to reading something that while may be heavy on theories, was probably well researched.Unfortunately the blurb on the back of the book has put me off; when a publisher describes its own publication as ""more than a little bit preposterous', it really doesn't make you feel like spending the time to read it."
3,Some promise here,"At times this is too cute by half, like ""Gedge's Song"", which also illustrates they are not very accomplished yet, it sounds like the singer is reading the lyrics and her breath control is lacking. On the other hand the essential instinct for songwriting seems to be there, most of the songs are put together well and are pleasing to the ears, that's more than half the battle, the rest they can learn. I'd like to see them play a little harder, lose the country tinge and the silly lyrics (""Fall Day"") and especially get more serious. Just because you're a girl band doesn't mean you have to be light and giggly. We'll see."
2,"only ""Hard Days Night"" is worthy","Yes, only A Hard Days Night has life to it, and some notion of how to chart bluegrass, and some reflection of the joy behind the original. The songs are very light on mandolin and the fiddle sounds too classical. Same complaint with most of the ""Pickin' on"" series. My wife Sissy fed the rest of the CD to our critters. You know, some people want SWAG; we want SKAGGs -->Bluegrass Rules! Oh yeah."
1,"nice idea, poor execution, better ones out there","i love bluegrass and the Beatles, but this cd fails because of the plodding arrangements. check out Craig Duncan's Bluegrass Beatles from his website to hear this done right."
2,Blueberry Fields Forever,"This album features instrumental bluegrass versions of Beatles songs played by session musicians. It's not very interesting. It's competently played (more or less), but without any feeling. I don't know anyone that this would appeal to."
4,Classy and Fine,"If you've bought Pete Fountain's CD's with him performing live, especially in the 60's and 70's, you heard pure Pete at his best. I have been searching for a CD version of an album with ""perfida"" and some equally beautiful selections. However, Pete Fountain's ""A Touch of Class"" is equally remarkable. He's still pretty terrific Now (see him in New Orleans to get the full experience). Pete loves the audience and it shows when he performs. Each note has his signature kiss. (okay, I'm getting a bit carried away, but it happens when I hear Pete Fountain)"
4,Delivers what it says,"The product has most things I wanted: Long extension cord, high joules power surge, and good quality.I would have liked it more if the outlets were spaced wide apart since most of my adapters have big plugs."
2,Flimsy outlet covers,"I have other Belkin SurgeMaster surge protectors that I LOVE and fully expected to love this one just as much. I was looking for a smaller surge protector for areas like my bedside table where I only have a small number of things to plug in. I love that the outlet covers slide over the outlet to keep dust (and cat fur) out of unused outlets. The outlet covers on other Belkin SurgeMasters I own are very sturdy. However, these outlet covers are quite flimsy - one even lifts up about 1/4 of an inch from the surge protector itself. I'm very disappointed in the quality of construction."
4,"Good, though big plugs may block two slots.","Good, though big plugs may block two slots, though one plug is farther away from the others so one big plug can go in without blocking two slots."
5,"Good design, strong, does its work well","As I said, it does its work well and the entire built is strong and does not have any part that would break easily unless you have a hammer in your hand!"
3,"Simply a watered-down ""C++ Primer""","This book would be useful for someone who is just entering the world of C++. If you are an experienced C++ developer and are looking for in-depth discussions of the new standard, this book is not for you. Better to go with the ""C++ Primer."""
3,Too concise.,"If you're new to programming, do NOT pick up this book.If you have experience in another OO language like Java/C# and want to learn C++ do not buy this book. Well, don't use it as the sole book to your C++ library. Purchase this book along with another more in depth book like C++ Primer.If you have moderate experience with C++, then pick this book up. It's lightweight so it doesn't clutter your bookshelf. I find it a great reference tool."
1,Surely the worst so far of all C++ books,"Essential C++ confronts its readers with a stream of silly examples, grotesquely misguided coding practices, opaque writing, and just plain errors. This book has no redeeming qualities and is appropriate for no audience.For a coherent treatment of a C++ subset see Gregory Satir's ""C++ The Core Language"" (O'Reilly ISBN 1-56592-116-X)"
5,e-Learning Designer's Bible,"Every instructional designer who designs for any form of electronic delivery (and this should be just about every ID out there) needs to know this. It should be a standard theory text for any university multi-media ID course.To not be familiar with this research would raise doubts on anyone who considers themself an ID. To teach Multimedia ID and not include this as a fundamental resource, brings into question just what the objectives of such a course could be."
3,I WAS SCREAMING!(AT THE AWFUL EPISODES!),"WHEN THESE EPISODES AIRED ON T.V(CHANNEL 5)I HATED THEM!THE ONLY REASON I GOT THIS WAS SO I COULD SAY I HAVE IT.SAM AND SONIC RACING,OLD NEWS!SONIC IN A HAUNTED CASTLE,SONIC HEROES STUFF!SONIC IN A JUNGLE,BORRRRRING!DID I MISS ANYTHING?PROBABLY,I ALREADY FORGOT WHICH EPISODES ARE ON HERE!"
4,"Enthralling, Cinematic, but perhaps a touch Forgettable","As soon as I heard that Hannibal was released I rushed to the bookshop in a cliched manner. I couldn't put the book down for the two days that I spent reading it, and when I did, I was breathless. However..... The scenes are atmospheric, and gripping, but I get the feeling that Harris is playing too much on the success of the Silence of the Lambs film. In hindsight, Harris seems to be too over-concerned with portraying Hannibal as a nice chappie with a small ""canibalistic"" problem. I guarantee that the film will be a stunner though..."
3,"Disturbed, deeply disturbed","Yes, some beautiful prose! Yes, some interesting new characters! But why did we have to resort to horror and gore? The beauty of the previous novels was that blood was only ""local colour"" so to speak. Here, it screams for attention in itself. Overall, I was very disappointed - horror fans and students of Italian art will both find enjoyable bits (not the same ones) but crime fans like me will probably want to go back to the previous books (although they get a bit spoiled by the character development in this one)."
2,Disappointing,"This book isn't in the same league as Red Dragon or Silence Of The Lambs. I mean, let's get real here: Hannibal Lecter kidnaps Clarice Starling and she ends up falling in love with him??? It's no wonder Jodie Foster refused to reprise the role she made famous in Silence Of The Lambs."
3,Gripping story...but I felt terribly betrayed at the end.,"This book brought back the wonderful characters I loved in Silence of the Lambs. The story line was exciting and I could absolutely picture these same characters, who performed as I would have expected. But, the ending really disgusted me."
2,Don't waste your time,"I wonder what the author was thinking of. He had such a great opportunity to create a great thriller.What a bizzare mess he cooked up. I think there is a really good movie in this, if a clever sceenplay author can cut out all the B.S."
1,"Leave all logic at the door, then read this sequel!","You would think that Harris would have read his previous book to know about the characters for the sequel. I can't give away the ending, only to say: ""Give me a break!"" In no conceivable way do any of these characters act this way in real life. And the protagonist, she's as nutty as the cannibal. There was not one believeable character in the whole book. Harris didn't have it for long, and he lost it quickly."
1,This book was such a disappointment.,"After waiting so many years for the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, I was greatly disappointed when I read this book. I found it mundane and boring. I was hoping for a more in-depth study of the characters of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lechter and the things that made them such wonderful opponents. I was highly surprised to discover the fact that Harris just wanted to get rid of them. If he writes another book, I'll wait for the paperback or check it out from the library. The promise Harris showed in Red Dragon and Silence certainly isn't reflected in this book."
1,The suckiest suck that ever sucked!,"I guess some authors only have one really, really good book in them. In Harris case it was The Red Dragon. Although I did enjoy The Silence of the Lambs, it wasn't as nearly as good as The Red Dragon, but still a good read. Then along comes Hannibal, and it turns out to be the worst piece of drivel I have ever had the misfortune to read!"
1,Peeee-Euuuuuuuu!!!!!,"Leave your morals at the door, suspend not only belief, but forget how the sequence of thought works, forget what you know about friendship, forget what a reading a good book feels like, forget this guy Harris was ever able to string two sentences together and engage your interest, forget that you squander every minute you spend reading this dead on arrival piece of doggy doo, and forget it, you're not getting a refund unless you stop after the first sentence and send this mistake back! Why oh why did I read the whole thing?? The ending was unforgivable. This is required reading for sociopaths-in-training. One good thing--you can line your litter box or bird cage with the pages and maybe save some money there. Otherwise, I would recommend just setting cash totaling the purchase price on fire. At least Harris won't get it. Thumbs down."
2,An okay book with a bad ending,"For the most part the book was entertaining. I felt it dragged in the middle of the book, and picked up once the action went back to the US. The ending defiantly destroyed it for me. With an early climax and and ending that I just plan didn't like. While it may have been a protest against the movie industry did I, as a reader, have to suffer?"
1,Grotesque and ridiculous ! It took ten years for this!,I believe Mr. Harris spent too much time on ways to make the reader gag and not enough time on the story. The plot is mundane and the ending is so bizarre it makes no sense. I am sorry I read this book. I was a big fan of the other three novels. I guess if you write with a movie in mind the story suffers.
1,Harris not true to his character,"It is rare that I would argue with a writer about a character in his or her book; after all, the writer did create the character. But I will in this instance. I was very disappointed in this book, for I don't feel that Harris was true to the character of Clarice. I just can't accept the ending as valid. My recommendation - see the movie instead."
2,LECTER IS A PHONY!,"What happened to Dr. Hannibal Lecter in this 7 years, better yet, what happened to Thomas Harris in this 10 years. I was expecting a great plot, with at least a few turning points, so I kept reading, never happened. Dont expect a great ending, better said, dont expect an ending. This book is not a thriller, and the suspense is DULL. Like many other people, I WASTED my time on this book."
3,Disappointment of the decade,"I started reading this book hoping that the publicity it received will match its substance. Boy, was I wrong! I just finished it today(after struggling to read it) and it is hogwash. Not enough characterization for me to relate to. The story was pulled in all directions---except where it would have been more entertaining. The only credit Mr Harris gets from me is for the beautiful descriptions of Florence. Other than that, this was a very big disappointment. Mr Harris, I want my money back."
2,The worst audio book I've ever heard,"It should have been great... The unabridged Hannibal and a long drive. Instead, we heard a mediocre story ruined by Daniel Gerroll, who was impossible to understand. Choosing to perform rather than read, we missed half of Mason Verger's tortured dialogue, got lost in all the Italian dialect and resented the accent he gave Clarice. Maybe the book is better, but I'll never know because I won't waste the time or money to read it. I promised the tapes to a friend for a transatlantic flight, but I'll do her a favor and loan her Certain Prey instead. What a disappointment."
2,I'll take Dollarhyde,"Simply put, I was disappointed with Hannibal. Harris fans waited too long, and got too little. By book's end, I thought I was reading another one of Anne Rice's gothic, semi-erotic tales. It just wasn't the Thomas Harris I admired in Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Give me Mr. Dollarhyde and Will Graham.Morose in Mississippi (havapeppa@aol.com)"
1,"Boring,vulgar","Very Disappointed,Harris did not live up to his standards. I expected a scary, on edge of seat, page turner. Had to plod along just hoping it would improve. Never did, ending was very unreal, seems left it open so he could jot off another. I liked Hannibal Lector when he was not the main character, he should have stayed as a bit player, would be reluctant to purchase a Hannibal IV."
3,I think I'm confused. Is that redundant?,"Have read the other books, loved them, and started out thinkingI liked this one, too. Purchased it and held it, unread, for a monthso I could take it on vacation with me.Was very disappointed in the immediately obvious change in Starling's characterBut also decided it was quite funny, and Harris can sure write some image-evoking scenes, and just some really lovely descriptions when he chooses.Then I read the very brief blurb from the reader in Denver telling us all what dopes we are not to realize the intentional parody. I guess I'm slow, and would love to know what he (she?) is referring to.Anyway, guess we'll wait for the movie, and another 8 years or so for the next installment. (sigh)."
3,"""Hannibal"" Cannibalized By Psychobabble","""Hannibal"" had all the ingrediants to be a worthysuccesor of ""Silence Of The Lambs"". The writng at timesmade you feel like you were there, including tension at key junctures that made it hard to put the book down. There did seem to be a bit too much of pyscobabble during the beginning and meat of the story, but the strength of the book overwhelmed that shortcoming. The ending was completely underwhelming. How could such a great author come up with such a ridiculous ending? I hope the movie version will change the ending. It would be a shame for such a great sequal to be-well cannibalized by psychobabble!"
2,ACK!,"This book started out so great and then copped out. I thought the disintegration of Starling was so disappointing. She is one of the few strong female characters in fiction and she was defeated. I felt like I was reading a script. Obviously this was written so that it could be made into yet another movie. It was predictable and boring. It was difficult to make myself finish. It had such potential in the first half, that I got through it in hopes that the ending would be pleasing. No such luck. I will read the others over again."
1,13-year-old boys will love it!,"Hey Thomas--stop trying to impress us with your arrested-adolescent gross-outs and the dull, half-baked psychoanalysis of your protaganists.If you think knowing what pate de foie gras is makes you a fascinating sophisticate, and that pointless amorality is 'deep', you'll be duly impressed by Hannibal.This book utterly fails both as thriller and as murder-mystery. The development of Hannibal and Starling is particularly lame. When characters in genre fiction stop being even remotely believable, there's no point in continuing.Harris phoned this one in--straight to the producers. Look for a film version ASAP, because Hollywood dictated this sorry story."
1,"The joke is on us people, and it is NOT funny!","Basic rule: Write for your audience. I have been reading reviews and it gets to me when people who loved this book say those who didn't lack the intelligence to understand it. I get it. I hate it. That simple. Now............. I don't know who Harris wrote this for but it was not for his readers or the fans or actors of SOTL who thrust him into literary stardom. It was strictly OK for the first few hundred pages then went completely to hell. The ending is ludicrous. I mean, were the characters of SOTL just a little inside joke for Harris and his crew at the publishing house? Like, ""Oh, we'll have millions buy into these characters and then in the next book which will sell even more copies we will screw them over! Yeah."" please...I could go on forever but then I would ruin it for any of you who have the time to waste who plan on reading this. I recommend counting the cracks in the sidewalk outside your house. That would prove more productive."
1,Uuuhh -- Could I get my money back . . . ?,"What on earth was THIS all about? I was expecting -- eagerly expecting -- a sequel to the masterful ""Silence of the Lambs"", with Clarice Starling, a talented young woman of determination and principle, and Dr. Lector, her brilliant, esoteric, monstrously self-disciplined mentor. But the principal characters in this book resemble their former incarnations in little besides their names. This Starling, while surpassing the former in physical courage, is a moral and spiritual coward; Lector has evolved into an ostentatious moon-calf. Moreover, the atmosphere, so chilling in the original novel, is this time merely sordid -- if not downright sickening. I think Harris should give serious thought to writing ""Hannibal II, Another Option"", this time at least keeping his characters in character."
1,What's with Steven King's review?,"After reserving my copy in advance, devouring it the minute that it arrived, what can I say? Rarely have I ever been so disappointed. I agree with the other 1-star reviews and just want to add two points:1.The front page review in the Sunday NY Times by Steven King really threw me for a loop. I love suspense, mystery, horror and read them by the dozens. This one was just not engaging, not to mention far below Harris' other work. Even the worst King was far superior to Hannibal.2. As a professional writer and editor with over 20 years in the field, the errors in the book appalled me. In addition to the points mentioned by other reviewers here, I found that there were sentences that I had to read twice or three times to try to grasp their meaning. Sad, sad sad."
1,"Well, I suppose it's better than reading the dictionary...","...but just barely. I borrowed a friend's copy and STILL felt ripped off at the end! If this thing ever makes it to film, count me out of its audience; what a disappointment!"
1,Major disappointment,"I can't believe Harris kept his public waiting eleven years for *this*. The plot was inane, and instead of being gripping I found myself plodding through major portions of it. Lecter and Clarice were caricatures of their fascinating old selves. I'm really sorry I paid for this book and would urge anyone thinking about buying it not to -- if you feel compelled to read it, borrow it from your local library. (I'm sure they'll have *lots* of donated copies!)"
2,No Silence,"Unlike its predecessor, Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is a horror story straight through. Its intention appears to make the reader recoil in dread rather than to follow the psychological spins and games of Lecter. None of the major characters in the book appear to have a reasonable motivation for their perversities -- rather they seem to be perverse for the sake of perversity and are therefore mostly contemptible. The antihero Lecter also appears to have lost the gamemaster-like quality in Silence, transforming into some Phantomesque alien being capable of superhuman feats without qualification. Some of the descriptions of his actions bear notice, since they are given a precision and refinement simply through the execution of language; however, this in itself is not sufficient to solidify Hannibal. Neither are the lame attempts to create a psychological background from which a monster like Lecter could spring. Simply too much to be believed -- better off left to the imagination..."
1,"Incomprehensible, choppy, terrible","I was shocked to find a really horrible book by Thomas Harris. I was a big fan of all of his other books. This one, however, was BAD, BAD, BAD. The plot was not interesting, the characters wholly unlikeable, and the ending ridiculous. I can't believe that I wasted my time! Don't waste yours."
5,What A Rollercoaster!,"This book took me from exteme highs and lows! It was fantastic! The turn around in Clarice Starling was completely unexptected, but I could totally relate. Having been through almost and identical career situation as her. The ending was completely unexpected, and beautifully written. I can't wait for the movie."
3,A big tease.,How exhilirating the first 400 pages were only to run head on into an ending that was very disappointing. The story was structured so well I was hoping it would never end but once it did disappointment & disbelief set in.
1,Save your money,"Predictible plot, thin characters- why did it Take Mr. Harris 7 years to come up with this obvious sequel?"
1,Disappointing,"Hannibal was easily the most disappointing read of the year, and this comes from a Harris fan whose been reading since Black Sunday.All the hallmarks: the precision of the plot, the minutae of detail, the authenticity: all gone.Instead we just rehash old characters, throw the antagonist into the lead role and on my God: the final section is just a Grand Guignol piece of puff.I so wanted to enjoy this book, instead it just casts doubts on his previous works. I understand David Mamet is drafting the screenplay: I hope he keeps the title and chucks the rest.Good points? Well the writing is as sharp as ever, not one word wasted, there's obviously a sharp mind behind it all. But it all seems small beer, somehow.I hope the next novel (will there BE a next novel?) strikes out away from this whole Lecter mess and into something fresh."
2,It WAS different,"Perhaps my level of anticipation was too high, but it was much greater than the actual event (reading the book). There were some surprises and a very different character in Verger, but I did not enjoy him. The psychological realizations of Starling and Lecter were interesting, but Clarice's final status was, to me, not believable. My advice: re-read Silence and Red Dragon."
3,Could have been a lot better,"Inside this book is a great story, but Harris spends WAAAAAYY too much time on critiquing and analyzing Italian art & history down to the very last inch. (WARNING: IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK DO NOT CONTINUE TO READ THE REST OF MY REVIEW)I liked how Clarice and Hannibal fell in love, but I didn't like how she had to become a cannibal like him (as he gave up crime at the end). Anyway, an average book that isn't a can't-miss thing."
1,What?,"I looked forward to this book for a long time, expecting the care, depth of character, and attention to detail that characterizes other books by this author, but was sadly disappointed. It is sloppy and frequently goes for the cheap shot. If you're going to keep characters and prolong a story it would be nice if they maintained integrity. Although Krendler sure got his. I wonder who actually wrote this book, 'cause it sure doesn't sound like Mr. Harris. I'll stick with Silence of the Lambs. Save yourself time and trouble and read something else."
2,politically correct serial killer...,"wins vacuous blond in the end. The good news is that hannible's victims all deserved what they got... except for the old curator of some Italian museum, but what the hey, how else could Harris bore us with his impressive knowledge of Italian history and culture for 200 pages? I'll give the thing 2 stars because I was able to finish it, but I really am getting tired shock 'art' and rednecks getting harpooned simply for being out of favor with the mass reading public."
1,IT TOOK 10+ YEARS TO WRITE THIS?!?!?!?!,"Wow. Wow. Wow. I just finished reading HANNIBAL and I'm stunned. Stunned that the same writer of RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS wrote this book. I can't stress how disappointed I am and how awful this book is. If it was any other writer and any other book, I wouldn't even have bothered to finish it. This book is so bad, it feels like something that was rushed to print to capitalize on the success of SILENCE, not something that took 10+ years to write!All I can say is, I wish Amazon let you give ""0"" stars as a rating option because that's what this ""book"" deserves."
4,HANNIBAL'S WINDOW,"I read it through, finding many endearing metaphors, I intend to revisit. This book approaches from a stranger perspective. At times, it pushes ""we"" away then brings us in, into Hannibal's inner world and a darkerville of Clarice. Where it ends, I'm sorry, what the hell was that? I'm laughing, sick and wonderful. Besides ending, this is a four-star book. Will they movie-it? pass the ham sandwich *grin*"
2,Somebody pass me my anti-arrythmia pills.,"I love Silence of The Lambs. I always like the macabre, so despite hearing all about the gruesome brain-eating and quasi-psychosexual scenes, I thought, ""What the heck, I can stomach anything. This is Thomas Harris, what can go wrong?""Plenty, as it happened. When I finish this book, I feel so queasy and sick in my stomach. I'll pass the chicken, give me a salad please."
2,A Major Disappointment,"Forget the Star Wars backlash. Hannibal is the true pop-culture disappointment of the summer. The book was actually in three- to four-star territory for a while. As outlandish and macabre as the new characters and situations are, they're never boring, and the novel zipped along...until the final chapters. Harris' resolution is a four-alarm misfire, a sick joke played upon his readers. He sacrifices characterization and logic for shock value, and the result will leave a bad taste in a lot of mouths."
2,The pressure to write the sequel results in a bad book,"Uh Oh! I am sad at having bought into the idea that this book might come close to the genius of Silence of the Lambs. Now that was a book that I couldn't put down! This one I put down a lot! I wanted to love this book, but I couldn't. I agree with the general consensus...the beginning was stupid, the middle very interesting, and the end a complete waste of paper.What a huge disappointment! Please dont make this into a film....at least not with good actors. You might just ruin their careers."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I regret the time I wasted reading this book. The plotting is simplistic and the juvenile ending hardly worthy of a teen horror flick. The constant shift of perspective and person (first person plural?) does not help. Dr. Lector as protagonist? I don't think so! Endowing him with a horrible childhood event, Harris wants to justify everything Lector does as somehow acceptable. He attempts to excuse Lector with the same simplistic psychology (""Poor Hannibal, he can't help himself!) he satirizes in the novel. I had more sympathy for the professional killers. At least, they had some trace of an ethical system. Finally, there is the poor Clarise. Harris has become the cannibal, feeding her to Lector who devours her psyche and repeatedly ""rapes"" her in a doubly incestuous relationship. I hardly think even poor Mishe would approve (she of the tooth in the toilet). This book belongs in the toilet! I recommend it for the remainder stack, the sooner the better."
4,Harris finishes the saga of hannibal and starling,"the first 80 % of the book sailed along just like its twopredecessors, but the last 20% or so of the book was a disappointment.Red Dragon is still harris' masterpiece."
3,Lee Valle,"I was anxiously awaiting the followup to ""Silence of the Lambs"". I bought ""Hannibal"" looking forward to more of the intense dialogue in the ""Lambs"".I liked the first part of the book, but was dissappointed near the end. I thought that Clarice tripped on her part of an investigator. Got too spacey.I will not recommend the book to others.Lee Valle ifrlee@earthlink.net"
3,Why oh why??,"When I started reading this book I kept in mind that it stands on its own, But still I was disappointed. I couldn't take away the image that I have in my head of Hannibal Lecter and the book just didn't rise to my expectations. I also felt that Starling's character wasn't really involved as one of the main characters except for the amazing beginning and at the end of the book. Furthermore, I really hated the ending. I just felt that all the qualities that made me love Hannibal Lecter, disappeared.I have to say that it is interesting at times and maybe if you can consider any character to play the role instead of Hannibal Lecter you can really enjoy it."
1,"Good bye, Hannibal, and good riddance!","I hated this book and the characters!! I really enjoy mystery/thrillers but this was too much. I read both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs and loved them. So, I was looking forward to Hannibal. I am so glad that I borrowed a copy and did not spend my cash on it. I felt that the whole intent was to discribe the most despicable characters doing the most despicable things. In that sense, it was a success. If you expect the quality and suspense of the first two books, I think you will be disappointed."
4,Slightly disappointing,"This book is known to most readers. I read it (whole thing) after seeing the movie. The book differs in some characters and in the ending, compared to the film. Harris writes quite well and uses an intresting technique to describe the happenings and feelings of the characters. The ending was a put-off for me, because I dont think it is 100% realistic. Starlings character would not do that (If you know what I mean). Still I recommend this book to those intrested in the macabre and chilling..."
3,disturbing between snores,"The book was exciting in parts, every bit as good as silence of the lambs. But then it would digress off on to characters that really were not that essential to the plot. More needed to be written concerning Clarice and her efforts to locate Hannibal and not how to raise and train pigs. I felt as though I were being given a crash course in Italian arts and that was not what I bought the book for. If you combined the begining with a brief explanation of the other characters and finished off with the ending, you would have an excellent story. As it was, ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ."
3,Hannible,"This book takes us to the world of Hannible Lecter as we have never seen before. The two previous books in the Hannible trilogy, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, dealt with Lecter and another criminal chase at the same time. Thomas Harris eliminates the ""other"" criminal and focuses specifically on Dr. Lecter. Harris repays the reader for this with the strange and extremely rich Verger family which keeps the reader with a weird feeling in their stomach. The book is amazingly written but leaves a tragic ending that comes as a true dissapointment for the readers of Thomas Harris' novels, and leaves a perfect series of sequels for Hollywood now that Harris has sold the rights to his signature character. Bottom Line: A great book but a weak finalle"
4,Disappointing but still the best book of the year this far,"I must confess that after finishing the book I was first quite disappointed.I felt that the evil doctor had lost his mysterious aura of supernatural evility. I think that the ""reason"" for doctor Lecters unique behavior should have been a lot stranger and more horrifying than his - in themselves disgusting - chilhood experiences.By its structure the book was also quite peculiar. I had and I still have the feeling like Harris had changed his original idea radically while writing the book. Was the original idea make all the things to happen in Italy, and maybe without Starling at all?I hope that this shall be the last Hannibal Lecter -novel; I think that Harris has said everything essential aboat him and Clarice.In every case Harris had succeeded to create again some of the magigal atmosphere of the ""Lambs"". The idea of the interial palaces was very beautiful.This was this far the best book of the year; Thank You very much mr. Harris."
4,Great read!,"Only THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY can match HANNIBAL for simmering intensity, chilling psychoterror, and depth of theme. This is a multi-dimensional work, perhaps too subtle for many, and certainly controversial. But it is worht reading, and that should count for a lot indeed. No, it is not perfect, but what is ?"
1,"A dull, pretentious fairy tale","Sorry. This novel is awful. A dull fairy tale that becomes less and less credible as it goes on, and ends up being just very very silly. Poor Mr Harris. Does he really think evoking all that Dante and cullenary nonsense make Lecter sophisticated? Oh dear. Harris has revealed something about himself in this novel that I'd never suspected of him: utter mediocrity."
4,"A worthy sequel, but the ending is a stretch","The book overall is quite good. Harris does a good job with the details, something that has been characteristic of his previous books. However, this attention to detail does make the book drag at parts. As the book progressed, I felt that Harris was trying to tie up all loose ends to make this the final book. Without giving anything away, I had trouble with the ending, which seemed to be quite a stretch. I know the prssure had been there for a sequel to ""Silence"", but was this book a little forced?"
1,I would rather read about the history of cardboard,"As much as thomas harris would like us all to admire, understand, and empathize with Hannibal Lecter, I refuse. Talk about giving Hollywood what it wants--let's create characters more evil and corrupt than Hannibal so we can cheer him on. Let's delve into his soul to understand how he is just a victim of society, then end with acts of heroism and ""love"" we can all feel good about. What made the first two books good was believable characterization and events. This one was utterly preposterous. Of course people will love it. It's one giant metaphor for how women are consistently manipulated by, and fall in love with, the most disgusting men on earth. Enjoy ladies. The first 400 pages gets 2.5 stars, the rest should be used to wipe with. If Anthony Hopkins stars in the movie adaptation of this trash I'll get a sex change"
1,Could the same author have possibly written this?,"I want my money back. I want my time back. I want the part of my brain back that is storing any memory of this book. Maybe I'll get lucky and Dr. Lecter will dine on that portion of my brain one day.It's quite a disappointment, to say the least, when a sequel is so bad that it ruins for you the memory of its precursor. Unfortunately, this book has done that for me. Not only did much of the story drag seemingly without end, but the parts that could have been interesting or exciting only end up being ridiculous and unbelievable. The ending is not only unbelievable, but unforgivable.My advice is that if you must read this book, borrow it from the library or an unfortunate friend who paid good money for it."
2,Ran out of ideas!,"I loved Lambs, so I couldn't wait to buy Hannibal. The first 2\3s of the book weren't at all dissappointing, but the ending is so absurd and out of character that it ruined the book. The only way to describe the ending is bad, bad, bad. On the other hand, I read Red Dragon just after Hannibal and loved it. Great story!"
1,The Reader from Atlanta Sept 28,"Wonders why people hated this book. Well, you have only to read the more articulate dissenting opinions. Scroll down, read the one and two star reviews. Ignore the vicious, personal attacks and concentrate on the criticism of the writing, the inconsistancies and anachronisms, the shameful copout at the end. Do these things, then save yourself the price of the book and read it at the library for free. If you come away thinking this was Harris' best effort, if you still think that you like it, go buy it. Support Harris. Here's what he thinks of you: ""Oh well, at least you people continually buy my book and financially support my self-gratification. Thanks!"" I think Amazon intentionally seeds these reviews with ""ringers"" that balance out the negative comments. After all, if a book gets a well deserved One Star, like Hannabal, they won't sell as many copies."
2,Where's the puzzles?,"It took me a while to decide the reasons why this book was disapointing, aside from the uneven, cluttered plot which smacked more of sequelitis, what was missing was the puzzles. Silence of the Lambs was filled with little brain teasing puzzles frequently of the excessively macabre fashion. This time out, there's lots of talk about Classical literature, art & gourmet cooking, but no puzzles. The result feels like when I read Michael Crichton's Lost World; A forced sequel rather than one that improves on the original."
2,not very good,I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't care for the ending at all...I thougt it was a little far-fetched. If this is really being made into a movie I know I won't go see it.
2,One of the most disappointing...,"This was definitely one of the most disappointing books I have read in a very long time. I kept going, waiting to get to the ""good"" part, but no such luck. I found both Lechter & Starling to be completely unlikable characters this time around -- I had always found Lechter to be quite entertaining before. Much of the gore in this novel was just there for the shock value. And the ending was the biggest letdown of the whole thing. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this, and bought it as soon as it came out. However, I found myself plodding through it, waiting for the ending. Definitely not worth the time or effort."
2,A disappointment,Saw the first movie and read the book. Bought this as soon as it came out and read it. It started out well but the ending was ABSOLUTELY unbelievable. Any woman reading this book will probably be very disappointed as it turns out to be written like a man's fantasy. Doubt that Jodie Foster will sign up to do the sequel unless they modify the ending significantly. Too bad - had the potential to be a great book.
1,Very disappointing and illogical,"After waiting with great anticipation for this book, I found it to be extremely disappointing. These were NOT the real characters created in Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. The most unbelievable part for me was the final outcome of Clarice Starling's character. I really expected a better story Mr. Thomas. Shame on you for this drivel. We all know you are capable of writing a GREAT story, I just wish you would have."
2,Hannibal was just not worth reading. Too Bad.,"After waiting for years for another Thomas Harris, It was an incredible let down to read Hannibal. The charactors were not remotely similar to those in Silence of the Lambs, nor was the plot. Many parts of this book were so disturbing, that I had nightmeres."
1,Trees died for this?,"Complete garbage. Thomas Harris is the quintessential hack writer who has duped the public into believing he's actually talented. Not one aspect of this novel is believable, nor is it even interesting. Of all the things he could have done with these characters, he used the most inane plot knowing the lemming-like public would buy it anyway. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins would be wise to stay far away from this film project. Starling and Lecter have done 360 degree turnarounds from their previous incarnations. It's all too sordid to even go into---don't buy it or read it."
1,Pathetic slop,"Anyone wonder what's wrong with society? That so many can get so excited for so little is pathetic. The book is slop, cheap and exploitative. The ending is absolutely ridiculous. Harris must be laughing at us."
2,Elements of intrigue in an otherwise average book.,"I've read both Silence and Red Dragon multiple times, and like most everyone else, was very eager for this book to arrive. Luckily it only cost me 21 dollars. The book does have its shining moments...showing us a bit more of Hanibal's character. I am surprised that it took 10 years to write this book, it contains nowhere near the detail or researched information that Silence or Dragon does. If you are a die-hard fan of Lecter's character, you should read the book, but dont expect too much. The ending is not that good, and only opens the door for yet another sequel."
1,Waited with bated breath... let it out with sigb of regret.,"If you ignore Harris's previous works, the ending would probably work for you. However, having not had the pleasure of removing the frontal lobe from my brain... I read the first two books and felt Harris betrayed his characters. Please God Please don't make a movie. Or, at least wait until I get the lobotomy."
1,Will the Real Hannibal Lecter Please Stand Up?!,"I have never been so disappointed by a book in all my life. Obviously Thomas Harris has been wasting the last eleven years! This book doesn't even belong in the same category with Red Dragon or Silence. Hannibal is pure unadulterated crap written (very poorly) to line Thomas Harris' pockets by perpetuating a fraud on his fans. It reads as though Harris put it down with 100 pages left to go and some poor wannabe author picked up and finished the tale without reading the preceding pages. Don't waste your money or your time, I felt angry and betrayed that I'd wasted mine on this poor excuse for a novel!"
4,Psychological thriller nearly at its best.,"I believe the book is very good. It is not only very exciting to read (I only had a one hour break from start to finish), but it has more. Harris manages to show, that no person is born good or evil, but the circumstances of our lives makes us the people we are - and more importantly shows that we are able to change. This book is not only thrilling, but gives an exciting glimpse of how human psychology works. Only problem is, that a few minor characters are not believeble."
3,Suspenseful and gory but a very poor ending.,"Starling character too shallow while Lechter's character was really expanded upon through his youth and early adulthood. Enjoyed meeting Mason Verger( sick as he is) but I thought the story line was not as deep as it could have gone. It kept me at the edge for a good part of the book , but the ending was easily forgotten."
3,"good read, but very srange","After reading this book, I've decided that it was okay...a good time-passer, but definitely not written up to the standards set by The Silence of the Lambs. In exploring the characters of Hannibal and Starling, I feel Harris has not gone in the direction he should have. IN this book, he has turned Lecter into a romanticized lead character and not the epitomy of evil that he once was. Harris tries to explain him as a human being and gives us the background we need as readers to understand him. If I had written this book, I would have left Lecter as he was...not insane really...just someone who plays by a different set of rules. Also, Starling becomes almost a stereotype of her previous character in this book. In closing, this book was an entertaining read. It just didn't go in the direction I would have liked to see it go."
2,Not nearly good enough to warrant the gruesome violence.,"I was disappointed with Hannibal. The grisly nature of the book was borderline sickening, and the plot was not involved enough to warrant this extreme violence. I liked the development of the characters in The Silence of the Lambs, but in Hannibal they were bumped off before they could become interesting! The development of the Lecter/Starling relationship and the ending was unexpected and welcome, but at the risk of repeating myself, the modes of dispatch were unnecessarily shocking. Mr. Harris is, therefore, going to have a tough time translating Hannibal into a screenplay the caliber of ""Lambs"" without allowing it to degenerate into a B-rated horror flick."
1,You should offer a zero rating for this book.,"This book is a bitter disppointment. The characters are shallow, repulsive and weak. The same can be said of the plot and its outlandish ending. While Mr. Harris' talent can not be disputed, nor his intelligence, I am left to wonder how he, such a brillant man and author, allowed this book to go to print. Bottom line: A tree was wasted."
1,Where's Miggs when you need him?,"Run, Jodie!!! Run, Sir Anthony!!! Nay, let not the casting director of ""Hannibal"" capture you!!!How sad. I loved Red Dragon. I loved Silence of the Lambs. Both were tight, suspenseful, chilling, thrill rides into the world of sociopathic serial killers. Both were difficult to put down, once I started to read. Both had me starting at sounds in the night. Both had me looking over my shoulder, making sure no monsters were sneaking up on me.Hannibal, on the other hand, had me looking at my watch to see if maybe something more interesting was happening somewhere. Anywhere!Mason Verger is a caricature of evil. Hannibal himself suddenly becomes the cannibal with a heart. Well, maybe not. Well, maybe he is. Well, maybe.... Who knows? Who cares? And Clarice -- why, she's just a woman, after all, to be molded by her man into something better. Or is it worse? Or is it just silly?I know why I pre-ordered this book; what I don't know is why I finished it...."
3,A little light cannibal fare,"First off: I think Harris should be commended for taking such a chance with these characters. They are HIS, after all, not yours, and I see this in every form of entertainment: when a creator turns his/her work in a new and different direction, you end up with wildly divergent fan reaction...as witness the other 400-odd reviews printed here.As for my own opinion of the story, I felt it was flimsier than Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Those books appealed to me more--they were deeper, somehow, psychologically. You really wondered what the hell Graham had gone through to catch Lecter--what it meant to have Lecter in your mind.In Hannibal, it seemed, that everything was spelled out. Maybe I missed something, but I don't think so.That, and the fact that so many passages in this book read more like script treatments or movie scenes, made me feel that this book serves more as a sequel to the movie than the previous novels.Thanks for listening. KK"
5,For fun: Read this book ALONE at NIGHT!!,"A worthy successor to Silence of the Lambs! WARNING: If you don't find Dr. Lecter sympathetic, you probably won't enjoy this book. I loved it! It wasn't quite as gruesome as everyone made it out to be. The ending was really the only way it COULD have ended. I was hoping for it halfway through the book. The changing POV worked really well. Especially when a narrator lets us watch Dr. Lecter,unbeknownst to him, in his most private of moments. The only negative thing I could say is that there wasn't enough of Clarice's point of view after the first few chapters. Thomas Harris has outdone himself!!"
2,Extremely inconsistent with the first two novels,"The author decides to shift the tone of this novel to that of a social commentary on evil, and in the process makes the characters behave completely unrealistic. That would have been fine if this were a new book with unknown characters; however, the fact that the first two books attempted to use realism as their focus, this book becomes very disappointing. The ending is probably one of the worst endings in modern fiction if you take the first two books into account."
2,What's up with this?,"Having read both Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, I rushed out and made a rare hardcover purchase of Hannibal. Having finished it, I feel...icky. Early on there are some great moments for Clarice and Hannibal but overall this book is a big, gross letdown. No, we really don't want to know about Lecter's childhood trauma. We don't want to see Jack Crawford forced into retirement. And what Thomas Harris has in store for Clarice-one of the greatest female literary heroines of the last 20 years-is criminal. The abrupt change in both hers and Hannibals characters in the last 100 pages is ludicrous. I hear David Mamet is writing the screenplay. I only hope he throws away the whole ending and starts over."
3,Entertaining but ending is disappointing,"Enjoyed the book. The characters have substance. Howver, the ending is disappointing."
5,Magnificent Obsession!,"Hannibal Lecter grows more and more fascinating with each book. Those with a sensitive sense of smell should be hanging out at bakeries or perfumeries, not reading great literature. You would probably have missed the whole point of Perfume, as well. Highly recommended!!"
4,A bit fartched at times but now Hannibal is my hero!,"I stayed up last night until 2:30am to finish the last 200 pages-that should tell you something! Although some of this book is hard to believe and at times hard to follow, Hannibal Lecter is one of the great fiends of all time. We root for him from the begining and the (predictable) love story is the only way for the trilogy to wrap up. I must say I can't wait for the movie."
1,"""Monster"" disappointment","200 pgs into the story I caught myself skimming. The ending felt like a betrayal. Certainly a novel this hyped would fall short of expectations, but please, Mr. Harris, have some respect for your readers, not to mention your characters. I've thrown the book away so as to never, ever lend this one out with my name attached."
2,Hannibal is typical far-fetched thiller!,"This was a page turner all right but it fell way short of my expectations. The plot is way out there and Harris seems to be trying too hard to gross everyone out. He throws in a bunch of deep literary and artistic references trying to gain some respect for an otherwise run-of-the-mill thriller. If you didn't already know and love these characters you wouldn't even give this book a second glance. It reminds me of a recent movie sequel set in space.Speaking of movies all the actors from ""Silence"" should run from this script. As-is ""Hannibal"" cannot be made into even an average movie."
2,"Clarice, we hardly knew ye","Being interested in the thriller/horror genre but finding many such titles much too graphic, obvious and/or badly written, I was happy to have stumbled upon Silence of the Lambs (on a remainder table, no less, long before the release of the movie). Mr. Harris' prose is well constructed, and he gave us two memorable characters in the shape of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter. Unfortunately, he has ruined both of them in Hannibal. Please--a kinder, gentler Dr. Lecter and Clarice as the Bride of Frankenstein? It's insulting to both, and I particularly dislike the way Clarice's honor is so cheaply bought. I am sure that Mr. Harris is enjoying the remuneration from his latest blockbuster, but I'm sorry to have contributed to it. In the book's favor, I can say that I read it within 24 hours of its purchase and found it enjoyable right up to the time that Clarice and Hannibal revealed themselves to be nothing but a gold-digging ex-cop and a misunderstood sugar daddy."
3,Lecter is no John Wolf,"Harris has returned in good form. Hannibal, unfortunately, has not. And Verger is a bad caricature. But the story holds you in there and makes you want to keep reading. I still prefer Red Dragon, and to a lesser extent, Silence. The most incredible psychopath of them all, though, is John Wolf (Prettiest Feathers, and Tunnel of Night). I laughed at parts of Harris. Philpin terrifies me."
2,"Thomas Harris is one of the best, but not with this book!","Thomas Harris moved us with Black Sunday. He stunned us with Red Dragon. Then he shocked us all with the Silence of the Lambs. Now that brings us to Hannibal. I have waited for this book to be written and then released. I have dreamed of what Hannibal would do. I had to think how the FBI( C. Sterling, J. Crawford) would do to put Hannibal back to where he belongs. Then I received the book, and I could not put it down for three hours. Suddenly I stopped and put the book down and said ""What is Thomas Harris thinking?"" I have never been disappointed with a T. Harris book before, now I wonder if he was finally tried of the Hannible concept. He had a chance to write a book that could have thrilled us for a long time and other writers could have admired for a long time. Now I am going to the other writers to find a better story because Hannible was a total waste to me and a big let down for one Thomas Harris long time fan."
1,Behavioral science? Let's talk about split personalities.,"When I first saw this sequel, I had never thought about whether one was required after Silence of the Lambs. After reading this, I can see why the thought never occurred to me.At first, I was enjoying they story line even if I found it very different from Silence. I must say that suddenly, as the book draws to it's conclusion, I found myself reading about characters I hadn't encounter previously in this novel. Who are those people? Did Mr. Harris suddenly get a new editor? I must say, I had the feeling that Harris had a distinct hatred of these characters, particularly Clarice.I feel as if this was written the way it was to avoid ever having to write about these characters again. Since irreparable damage has been done, please refrain from further descriptions, Mr. Harris. Life is disillusioning enough. I don't need further disappointments in my recreational reading."
2,---- Clarice this ain't ! ----,"While the author creates an attention holder as was enjoyed in ""Silence"", the story doesn't provide a consistent characterization of Clarice that's believable. As portrayed in this book, Clarice is someone who didn't seem to relate to the character in the previous work. She's someone we don't know. It almost appears that Harris was under some pressure to complete this book, and took what can only be regarded as a cop-out conclusion that leaves the reader wanting more; more of the characterization true to the person of Clarice shown in ""Silence"", not of the limp clone that he portrays here."
4,Compelling,"After I read this novel I decided to reread RED DRAGON, because of some of the references to it. It has been years since I read it and while rereading it, I was convinced of a feeling that started with HANNIBAL. This is not so much a story of Hannibal Lector, but an indictment concerning our justice system today. In RED DRAGON, everyone was working together to get the Tooth Fairy/Red Dragon. By the last book, everyone is at each others throats with greed, power, and revenge the only motivating factors. The old time policmen are gone with only the sycophants left."
1,Awful,"Hannibal is a major disappointment. I should have known betterthan to buy and read it especially after perusing the plotline revelations online, but when I read Silence of the Lambs curiosity got the better of me so I went into Hannibal with low expectations and it was even worse than what I had expected. It's unworthy as a novel let alone a sequel to a brilliant book and movie. I pray this never gets turned into a screenplay with Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins signing on. Thomas Harris can surely do better than this it's just a shame that this is how it all turned out."
1,Ridiculous. Poor dumb ole Starling never sees it coming.,"Harris has taken a strong fictional women's character and reduced her to mush. In Silence of the Lambs, Starling was a fighter, a role model. She took her licks but came out alright. In this book she is a helpless little victim who completely sells out. The plot is absurd. The ending is a disaester. Someone needed to throw a book together quickly, and get PAID..."
2,Extremely disappointing,"While there are some pages full of tingling suspense, this book is more than disappointing. I don't cringe at violence and ""gross moments"" (and there were plenty in both ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"") when they help tell an enticing story, but in ""Hannibal,"" I got the impression Harris was just showing us nastiness for no reason other than the ""shock and buck"" factor. I didn't *need* to know why Hannibal is the way he is, but if I were going to be told, I'd like more of an explanation of the causalities than were given. The end: bizarre and cheap. Like so many other fans, I would have preferred to see a ""new"" story that perhaps drew on old characters rather than this drivel."
2,A complete waste of money and time.,I have read some of the other readers comments and one of them suggested that the people who gave this book 1 or 2 stars were simply not intelligent enough to understand how wonderful this book is. So let me begin by stating that I am a member of MENSA (the High IQ society). My IQ ranks me in the top 1% of the country. I thought the book was awful! The whole part that took place in Italy was boring and the ending was ludicrous! No I didn't expect it to be just like Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon which were both excellent but I did expect it to be a good book. It wasn't.
2,Left me Unsatisfied,"Again another example of too much hype. Silence of the Lambs was an outstanding book, but sadly Hannibal does not even compare to that creepy masterpiece. The book starts off at a breakneck pace, but the second half of the book just left me confused, and unfufilled. I kept thinking that this was not the Lector that I had enjoyed so much in Harris' previous books. The ending in my opinion is a total cop out, and seems totally implausible, and thats all I'll say about it. In closing read Red Dragon, and Silence, but stay away from this one!!"
3,If Dr. Evil and John Merrick had a kid,"It might look like the ludicrous caricature that turns out to be the main villian in this book. It even comes complete with a set of inept henchmen, an unnnecessarily complex lesbian, and an even more unnecessary shower scene.To the book's credit, it was a super-fast read and was highly entertaining. However, it was riddled with spelling and grammar errors, sloppy flipping in tenses, and incomplete sentences! AAAUUUGGHHH!!AS FOR THE ENDING...well, I am still out to lunch on it. However, I can't deny that it has stayed foremost in my mind since the moment I shut the book. It may be wierd, but it is definately haunting, and isn't that what you look for? Something that will stay in your mind whether you want it to or not?"
1,What happens when a good author goes bad,"While Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs scared and delighted me, Hannibal bored and irritated me. What could Mr. Harris have been thinking? I plodded through the book and felt like someone looking at a bad accident out of morbid curiosity. I should have given up when my instinct told me to."
4,Brilliantly sculpted.,"Thomas Harris crafts another fine tale, with reprises from his most colorful characters: Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter.It seems that public opinion of this book falls in one of two diametrically opposed camps: ""I loved it"" and ""I hated it"". This is somewhat surprising, given the book's similarity in terms of descriptiveness to Silence of the Lambs, a book (and film) which enjoyed unprecedented success and critical acclaim in this genre.The sticking point, it seems, which separates these two camps involves the highly contentious ending. Without spoiling this for potential readers, suffice it to say that it invokes a stretch of imagination.Harris's mind is clearly in another world entirely (this man scares me), making his well-researched and well-referenced style entracing. What's not to like?"
2,Disappointing,"I feel Mr. Harris tried his very best to be outrageously decadent. He succeeded in making his book an outrageously funny black comedy. His other books were very suspenseful and daring with one of his characters being canabalistic. This time that roll was given to the pigs. I feel this story went over the edge and had no redeeming qualities, not even the pretense of an art history major who just returned from his first visit to Italy. Mason Verger and his sister were both totally unbelievable characters. I do think the ending was very weak and was only there to leave the door open for the future little hannibal cannibals. Sorry Tom, I think you got too greedy with this one and just rushed it."
2,Over-done,"As I was reading this book I was reminded of musicians that have lost their magic and try to over-compensate by hiding behind way over-produced recordings. I did enjoy learning a bit more about what drove Dr. Lecter, but was generally unexcited about everything else. I couldn't put his other books down, this one took me two weeks to plod through."
1,Awful Just awful.,"I'm embarrassed for Mr. Harris that he has concocted such a bunch of drivel and called it a novel. While he's laughing all the way to the bank I'm going to toss my half-read copy of HANNIBAL into the lake and invest my time in reading some of the GREAT new novels out this summer, like THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, and STONES FROM THE RIVER, and MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and BAG OF BONES."
1,The genius of Mr. Harris was obviously his past editors,"They might have stopped him from releasing such a completely dumb book. Where 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence' were so beautifully crafted, this time out Mr. Harris seemed to be just racing a deadline. But he does have our money now, doesn't he? And he's set up for another lame sequel. And the ending? Are you kidding? Just think of 'Melrose Place' if it were on cable.Yuk."
2,Harris needs an editor,"What exactly made Carlos' head so ""malodorous""? This phrase was used at least 5 times. Verger actually said ""She can't prove she didn't do it"" two or three times. It reminded me an assignment in creative writing where you had to use as many cliches as possible. The story was all right, but could have been much better if Harris would have deigned to allow his precious work to be edited. It is inventive and fresh to create new metaphors that really bring the reader in to the story. It is annoying though when one thinks so highly of their newly coined phrases to keep using them over and over..."
3,this took seven years?,Mr. Harris' first two books in this 'series' seemed to be examinations of the criminal mind and how an investigator uses evidence and intuition to stop psychos. This book reads like a digusting apologist screed for the indefensible actions of the 'hero' Lector. Mr. Harris is an excellent writer. However this story is strained in the sense that all the characters are weirdos. I understand that examinations of ordinary people do not a bestseller make. I do not understand why even minor characters must be given digusting quirks. This book is enjoyable. I garner some enjoyment reading about the flakes that the world can produce. The ending and the resolution of the relationship between Starling and Lector is obvious and possibly the worst of all possible endings to this story.
2,An elegantly-written dud,"Harris has crafted another monster in Mason Verger; genuinely evil with no redeeming qualities. Although his sister Margot's role is predictable, her character is complex and tinted with moral shades of gray. The author guides the reader through several tours of Dr. Lecter's ""memory palace"", where elegance and culture disguise the septic tank beneath. Harris gives Hannibal a motive; but vacillates between maintaining Lecter's evil status or humanizing him. Harris doesn't seem to know quite what to do with the character of Barney; initially making him a player in the plot, then abruptly erasing Barney until the end. Starling continues her role as the driven FBI agent battling her own personal demons, until the author unravels her moral fiber in the disappointing, implausible ending to this book. The final few pages have the effect of an author trying for shock value while meeting a publication deadline. A disappointing work from a talented author."
2,disappointed,"I've enjoyed previous books written by Thomas Harris, but this one was truly disappointing. I loved the ""chase"" of Hannibal across the continents, but I was stunned by the ending. I kept reading thinking, ""this must be a dream sequence."" Did someone else write the ending to this book? The author can't possibly claim to know his characters as their actions, particularly Clarice Starling's, in the last few chapters are completely unlike them. Please don't even suggest another sequel!"
2,Not worth it.,"After having read ""The Red Dragon"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"", I was looking forward to ""Hannibal"".I enjoyed most of the book, mainly because I liked the detail Mr. Harris goes into describing the characters and the situations. I was very disappointed in the conclusion of the book, it was just too hokey of an ending."
1,Was this really written by Thomas Harris?,"This book was nowhere near as good as his other books -- in fact, it's hard to believe it's the same author. And the ending is insulting to his readers who have waited ten years for the sequel. I hope they don't bother making a movie out of this one. I can't imagine Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins starring in it, as the quality is substandard."
2,A disappointing read,"The media having leaked the news that Jodie Foster had declined the offer to revisit her Clarice Starling role, I was a bit wary of reading the book. I don't feel this was written as well as ""Silence...""; I found myself just skimming entire paragraphs because I was bored. I agree that Verger is almost more of a demon than Lecter, and his behavior with the visiting child drew loathing...at least Lecter didn't mess w/children's minds. I was terribly disappointed with the ending - I don't blame the classy and intelligent Ms. Foster for saying ""No thanks!"""
1,Wow! Is it really that bad?,Thomas Harris has done the most amazing thing. He has writtenthe best suspense novel of the 20th Century (Silence of the Lambs) andthe worst (Hannibal). Silence of the Lambs will never be forgotten. Hannibal already has been.
2,Ending negates an average narrative,"I read this story and kept thinking these characters are really bizarre. However the pace and story line were good enough to keep my interest.The author used a strange writing style. At times it was a straight forward narrative and then would change to a voyuer type of writing. As if the reader and author were peeping in on the life of actual people rather than characters in a book.I kept on with it and read the final two chapters of the book. I HATED THE ENDING. I thought Mr. Harris showed contempt for the characters he created in his two previous works. I can't say enough bad things about the ending. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read the book and reveal the ending. I will say that if the movie follows this book, especially the ending, I won't be seeing it."
4,Entertaining.....Good stuff,"Bought it before I headed off to Florida for 7 nights cruise in the caribbean. Of all the things I could do on a 110,000 ton ship, I decided to stay in my room and read this book. It's not a must read or a classic but an entertaining book. Story flows easily and characters are twisted enough to make it exciting.Worth every penny of paperback. Have a good time."
1,Yuk!!!!,"Yuk!! I felt like I needed to take a week long shower after finishing this book. I think that the author has been caught up in the Hollywood-ization of his work, and so he simply cranked out the most violent and incomprehensible swill he could come up with to make into an also disgusting movie. Until this book, I've enjoyed all of Thomas Harris books. I almost wondered if this was a ""[descriptive word] you"" to all the greedy movie types. You know the old--""You want a movie, fine.. I'll give you a stinking movie..."" Would have given it zero stars or a negative rating if possible...."
4,A satisfactory sequel to Silence of the Lambs,"A terrific read which completely held my interest for almost the entire book. I found the end, a bit unconvincing but that in no way detracted from my overall enjoyment of the book and it was not illogical as had been stated by other reviewers, but rather a continuation of where Harris left off in SOTL. I would encourage all who haven't read it yet to give it a try, you will not be disappointed."
2,"Wait for the movie, the book was not worth the wait!","The only reason this book gets two stars is because of the Italian section, and the first few chapters. Two good sections, two stars. The ending was just plain silly, and there were too many two page chapters that didn't give us any new information only reinforced what we all ready knew. If you want to read a good Lector story re-read RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."
4,A great follow up to one of the best horror books ever.,"This book was nearly as riviting as the original, with as many chills and surprises as I would like to handle in one reading. The character roll over is great, kudos to Harris for remembering who is characters are after this long an absence."
3,Gripping and disgusting in equal measures,"I found this book extremely gripping, but ultimately not satisfying. Certainly not as good as the author's Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. My major gripes are that Lecter becomes a virtual superman in this book, capable of almost any feat, and the ending, of course. At least it was unexpected, if disgustingly absurd."
3,"Good, but disappointing...","I anxiously awaited the arrival of the next Hannibal book, after reading Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. The book starts out with a bang - grabbed my attention immediately. Clarice is facing some hard times at the FBI...she is in trouble. Harris does a really good job of drawing me into the situation. However, the next section of the book comes to a grinding halt. It is almost like this section of the book is written by someone else. After I finally got through that section - the last part of the book clips along (I guess this is were Harris takes over the writing again!).My only disappointment with the book is the ending - without giving it away, it is a very unlikely situation."
2,Bromo please,"RE: ABRIDGED AUDIO TAPE READ BY AUTHOR. There is no doubt that Hannibal Lecter is an intriguing character but like an oh-so-rich dessert, is better enjoyed in modest portions. I liked Harris' previous 2 efforts where the doctor dominated quite effectively from a supporting position. Here he is served up as the main course on a heaping platter that ultimately proves indigestable.At first listen, the author's southern drawl is distracting but as the story develops, I came to appreciate his informed interpretation of the work, if not the work itself"
1,I cannot believe i wasted money on this toilet paper,"If you liked Silence of the Lambs, let it end there. You will thank me later. This story has none of the horror, none of the compelling drama. The only it had in common with its predecessor was that it used the same names. Apparently if you use the same names from book to book you dont have to use their same personalities. I was severly disappointed with Thomas Harris' fourth attempt."
1,disappointing,"Hannibal reaffirms my long held personal theory that most contemporary authors have only 1-3 (maybe 4) good books in their careers. ie: Mario Puzo & The Godfather-Stephen King had maybe 4. While I thoroughly enjoyed Black Sunday, Red Dragon and even managed to find some literary salvation in Silence of The Lambs, it is clear (at least to me) that with Hannibal, Mr Harris has, like his aforementiond contemporaries, finally touched the bottom of the barrell. It will be interesting to see if he tries to redeem himself with a sequel."
1,How could this happen after Silence of the Lambs?,What a disappointment! I had been eagerly awaiting the continuation of the Hannibal Lecter story. What a let down! The plot was completely unbelieveable and the character development was nothing like this book's predecessor. I wish I hadn't been in such a hurry to get this book as soon as it was released. My only hope is we DON'T see this weak story on the silver screen. Silence of the Lambs was one of the BEST adaptations I have ever seen from a book.
1,Big disappointment.,"I was terribly disappointed with this book. Was expecting SO much more - Silence of the Lambs was excellent! The story dragged, there was very little 'suspense'. The ending absolutely destroyed the whole 'Hannibal' reading experience. I probably will not purchase another book by this author."
2,This book sucks,"Where ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" explored the psychology of the serial killer and provided thrilling plots to boot, ""Hannibal"" takes a different tack. It goes for the gross-out. Calling this a disappointment is an understatement. Believability doesn't even seem to have been a consideration here, and Harris betrays (or causes outright reversals) in the nature of characters he developed solidly in earlier books. I have to wonder what Harris was doing for eleven years. It certainly can't have been working on ""Hannibal."""
4,"Stephen King was right, very good","Stephen King's review was right on the money. This is a fascinating story. It is condensed to some degree, and each character seems to have only one single moment in his or her life that defines his or her personality. Taking time to develop each character more completely would have made this a 1000 page tome. As it stands, a quick read with a good story."
4,I stayed on the edge of my seat!,"I've never been one for mysteries, but I picked up this one, because I had seen Silence of the Lambs. All I can say is Wow! This is a quick read, with scenes and action on every page. Despite the sometimes gruesome parts, it keeps the reader breathless throughout. And the ending was . . . well, I really don't want to say how it ended. It just wouldn't be fair.For lovers of the unusual, this is a great book. Just beware what you order at dinner . . ."
1,A Monsterous Disappointment,"I can't believe that I wasted 500 pages worth of time on this atrocity of fiction. The characters are loathesome and uninteresting, not to mention laughable and absurd. I kept on reading only to the belief that it has to get better. I never read the Silence of the Lambs, but if it was anything like this, they must have done a lot of rewrites pre-production for the film version. News that Jodi Foster doesn't want to be a part of this film adaptation is no surprise, in fact I hope they scrap the whole idea. This book, with no other better way to say it, is so stupid. The only reason that a book of this caliber could ever make the NY Times best-seller list has got to be the herd instinct of readers. I am only sorry that I went along with them. Don't be a part of the herd."
1,Skip it!,"This is truly a case of living in a society that has been numbed by violence and morbit thought alike. The book ""Hannibal"" is the worst kind of deforestation. It would be easier to digest the let-down of this work if there had not been moments of great promise along the way.With out destroying the integrity of the suspense A would be reader should be forewarned that in this book Starling's most treasured qualities, the very ones that drew us to her are replaced by sheer lunacy and immature fiction.First and formost it is a novel. But anyone who reads this book can see why an actress the caliber of Jodie Fosterwould dismisses this storyline. An in fact, with out a major overhaul of the ending the film version will not play in America."
1,"A bad read that led to a ridiculous, unbelievable ending","I'm so dissappointed. I eagerly read this book only to find narry a character that I cared about, was interested in, reviled, or even pitied. Definitely a sorrowful sequel to Silence of the Lambs."
2,Pretty Bad,"It almost seems as if Harris rushed through the book, when he had years to write it. It is very disjointed and constantly told from the same banal perspective and therefore reads like a screenplay and not like a novel. The ending is completely out of character and the events that transpire leading up to it are so odd, that they are just wrong; they do not fit into context at all."
1,"NO STARS HERE, OR A MOVIE","Don't waste eye movement on this book. If there were no stars possible, that it what this should receive. Inconceivably disappointing, incredibly weird and illogical, too many holes in the plot to plug with an octopus. Ridiculous premises and implausible actions. Limp effort at horrifying the reader presumably to mask the absence of a plot leading to a laughable ending."
2,Caveat Emptor!,"An author of genius has succumbed to pressure; the book feels as awkward as a seven month fetus. Perhaps the wait was too long, and the expectation too high, but I know I gasped out loud when I saw that the book was being published, and I gasped with horror when I read it."
4,"Colorful, abnormal personalities; each with their own agenda","show that Harris continues to create characters who are uniquely his own. If you expected a cookie cutter sequel to Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, you may be disappointed. I wasn't, and thoroughly enjoyed the outlandishly psychotic behavior of each personality. Afterall, this is the story of Lecter and Starling who are, oddly enough, attracted to each other from the outset. Add to this strange fascination of Starling's moth to Lecter's dangerous flame; a former child molester who had been a client of Dr. Lecter's and had made the mistake of offending Hannibal's sense of decency, paying for it with a loss of face, literally; now out to seek revenge...well, what can we expect? Crazy people don't behave sanely. I liked the twists and shuddered at all the right places. Harris writes to please himself and those of us willing to accept the bizarre antics of his characters, aren't offended."
4,"A book for those who like Harris, not Demme.","Harris has an increadible gift for bringing life's less pleasant aspects to a stunning, if not brutal light. While not for the squeemish, Harris is true to form and true to his charectors. If, after seeing the movie, you expect Anthony Hopkin's ""Lecter,"" think again. As a charector, Lecter is written evil, without apology, and he makes no bones (forgive the pun) about it. If you search for safe summer reading, pick up Danniel Steel, but if you want to be scared and intruiged, this book is perfect."
1,Did Anne Rice Write the Last 6 Chapters?,"As Red Dragon is one of my favorite books, I was truly looking forward to this novel. I thought it was acceptable...until the last chapters! Overblown, unbelievable, over the top...it reminds me of My Fair Lady set in hell - ridiculous! It read like bad Anne Rice! One of the things I liked about Red Dragon and Silence was the realism and the gravity with which Harris treated the subject matter. Now Lechter only eats ""free range rude"" people and Starling is won over with cashmere and emeralds? Ugh..."
1,Don't waste money or time on this book,as Jed Clampet would say.. Pitty-full. Terrible compared to his prior masterworks. Inconsistancies.. Are we to believe that Lecter left a victim alive years ago.. who did not turn him in? (remember that Lecter was caught by the character in Red Dragon. But this book has a character who could have Identified him as the man who tore his face of..but did not? The Ending was so bad.. I gave the book away.
5,"A Real ""Page Turner""!","I am not a very fast reader. And I don't read that much fiction at all. But I could not put this book down. I began reading it on a Saturday and finished by Monday. It is a very good read. Its exciting and keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. Now I will say it is not for the squeamish. If anyone saw the film of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and it made you sick or really creaped you out then don't read this book. For everyone else, who saw that film, you have to read ""Hannibal"". It is truly thrilling."
2,not a gripping tale,"Compared to silence of the lambs, this book is awful. It reads like a movie script and unlike the last Hannibal book, I had no trouble putting it down. In fact many passages were boring. I would not sped the money. There is too much else out there worth reading"
3,"The ending is sappy, but still well written","I must agree with the other reviews that the ending was a great disappointment. Also I'm wondering why Hannibal turned out to be such a great guy after all. If he can understand Stephen Hawkin I don't understand why he can kill innocent people around and then fly away with the girl of his childhood dreams. The author is undoubtedly a good writer, and much of his research and knowledge are impressive, but for this book I really can't give a 5 star. I will wait for his next one for a masterpiece."
3,"Good Read, but not true to characters","As a dedicated Thomas Harris fan, I anxiously awaited the release of Hannibal and ran out and bought it in hardcover the first day. I can't deny that it a supurbly written novel--in all of it's ghastly, gruesome, and suspenseful pages. In the end, though, the book disappointed me because I don't feel that Harris stayed true to the characters of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. They both behaved in ways that they would never have considered in Silence of the Lambs. The story in and of itself is fabulous (as long as you don't have a weak stomach), but as part of a whole, it was a cop-out with the characters forgetting personal standards for plot convienance."
2,To put it nicely: Not up to par.,"I greatly enjoyed his previous books and I eagerly anticipated reading ""Hannibal."" Now all I can say after finishing the book is, ""What! "" The book had its good moments but there were long periods that lulled me to sleep. I felt that the author betrayed the two great characters of Lecter & Starling with his awful conclusion, and in doing so, betrayed the fans that built his fame. Lecter's macabre mystique and power & Starling's balance of strength and vulnerability? - the authors throws all of this out in this book like used kleenex. I would say it ranked with ""Godfather III"" in disappointing sequels. If you are a fan of Silence of the Lambs, my advice is: read the first half of Hannibal, then make up your own ending - you couldn't do any worse."
1,"Decent book, absurdist ending","I must admit despite some inconsistancies (ex. when did Clarice become a world class marksman? Certainly not in ""Silence of the Lambs!"") I liked the first 450 pages of this book. Though I felt the descriptions in the Florence portion of the novel many times uninteresting and pedantic. Most readers would probably agree with me in that the Barney/Margot relationship was superfluous except as a plot device in the end. My problem, like many others, was with the ending. To describe it as Nihlistic would be kind. It is Absurdist!"
4,This isn't the book people wanted...,"...it's something even better. Mr. Harris provided the template of the Obsessed Cop/ Serial Killer novel with ""Red Dragon,"" and perfected it with ""Silence Of the Lambs;"" rather than trying to outdo himself with ""Hannibal,"" he instead gave us something new; a fable in which every major character is capable of tremendous evil (including Clarice Starling). There are no Good Guys/Bad Guys in ""Hannibal,"" only Monsters..."
3,not as good as Silence of the Lambs.,"If one has been to Florence, then he/she can almost smell the city; the imagery is that strong. As for the rest, well it did not hold together nearly as well as Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. It is quite apparent that the ending is a set up for another book and another film, assuming this one is purchased by a studio. I did enjoy the book, but it is not the best thing I've read in the last two weeks."
2,Disappointed in the end,"Why the author spent so much time detailing Italian history and over looked the successful qualities included in his prior novels, was a mystery to me regarding this book. Where were the overviews of the technologies available for crime fighting as in the Red Dragon? Where was our protagonist? The author spent too much time trying to disgust me instead of working on an engaging story. Yes, the book kept me absorbed, but only to make me feel I had wasted my time reading it in the end."
2,gruesome,"An incredibly long, wordy, disgusting story with no real plot. All the characters, except Clarice, were horrible people who committed unbelievably revolting acts that could only have been included for the shock value (and ""make me want to vomit"" value). In the end, even Clarice dissapoints. I found it hard, despite (or perhaps because of) the detail, to actually follow some of the actions. It was somewhat interesting to learn more about Hannibal's motivations, but I would have preferred hearing those parts from someone who had read the book rather than subjecting myself to the entire story."
2,"love thomas harris, this was a BIG let down",thomas harris must have gotten tired while writing Hanibal. Well written but poor imagination throughout and especially toward the end. let us hope that he can redeme himself with his next book .
3,Please tell me I dreamt that inane ending.,"How discouraging to have read the entire literary work, riveted to each word, only to discover that I had exhausted hours of my precious time for nothing. The ending left me unsure just where Mr. Thomas Harris will commence with his next novel. I have no doubt that he clearly has his work cut out for him."
2,Disappointing to the max!!!!,I waited for this book with more anticipation than probably any other book I have ever read. The need for Harris to provide details that got more graphic as the story progressed is nothing but a shock ploy. While I loved his other books this offering has poor character development and worse plot flow. If this is what takes him all these years to produce I for one will not be anxiously awaiting another.
3,Not bad... but not that good either!,"After I managed to trudge through the Italian culture lesson, I thought Harris was building up to a classic ending. Not so. It was as though Harris was writing a school essay and decided to finish it as quickly as he could so he could get out to play. I had high hopes for this book following Red Dragon and Silence, but I'm afraid Dr. Lector simply out grew Harris. As for the ending, please... I don't think so. If this makes it to the big screen, it will take some performance from Hopkins to keep Dr. Lector the likeable cannible we all love, alive. The success of the film will depend on the actor who is to play Mason Verger, who was unfortunately the real star of this book."
4,What a good and disturbing read!!!,"I enjoyed this book very much. His characters, Hannibal, Clarice, Mason . . . are priceless and complex. I feel guilty because as I was reading this book I kept imagining what the film would be like. I hope Jodi Foster and Sir Anthony are able to act together in Hannibal if it is made into a movie. I would love to see these Academy Award winning actors bring Hannibal and Clarice to life in this very disturbing book. I would recommend this book to others with the caution to expect the unexpected at the book's end or it will be quite the heart stopper. No one told me about the ending and I am glad of it because the impact was very startling and fascinating, enough to imagine the film ending to this good book."
2,What a disappointment!!!,"This book, while on its own, is an ok read, does not compare with the previous two Hannibal Lecter books. There is no tension; weak plot; very little new about the good doctor. And the ending--what a crock!!"
1,Trilogy ends (I hope) with a whimper.,Harris has gone off the deep end with this book. As others have said the ending is the worst I have EVER read in any book. If you like his previous books do NOT read this one and preserve your memories of the characters. Most of the book is exactly what you would expect in a sequel and seems a little simplistic at times. Then he writes a very non-normal ending but a worse ending then a formulaic one could ever be. Horrible! When winter rolls around this book will go straight into the fireplace.
3,"A pleasant read, yet a pale effort from Harris","Maybe we expected too much. The hype regarding this sequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS began last year, with speculation that Hopkins & Foster would wait for the story before signing on.The story rolls along fairly well, with a few major characters introduced, and a new locale in Italy. There is your pre-requesite amount of graphic detail, pyschoanalytical mumbo-jumbo, and Starling up again the world.The ending itself was quite a surprise, but it reads as a quickie, neat & tidy, and pretty implausable ending. I cannot imagine Mssr's. Hopkins and Foster reading the conclusion, and keeping a straight face.If you have read all of Harris's stories, you will be able to anticipate just about every turn in the story. Still, not a bad effort from Harris, but not one of his best."
2,"Preposterous, but interesting","The official Thomas Harris website allows us to hear in the authors own words, the fact that Hannibal took 3000 days to write. During those 3000 days, Mr. Harris did wrestle with the preposterous, yet even when he has ventured beyond the point where we may suspend our disbelief, he remains interesting to read. The manuscript, poorly edited as it may be, is a tweak away from a screenplay, and what may seem preposterous to the reader, is mere fluff when compared with modern movie horror. I enjoyed the attempt, but disliked the final product. Pigs eating people? Enormous eels shoved down one's throat? Perhaps the movie shall be called... ""Hannibal...I still know what you did last summer..."""
1,Disappointing...,"The Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs each were terrific studies of human nature within a tight, engrossing, thriller. Hannibal was neither, and wasn't even written very well. Harris should have been able to capitalize on the interesting characters he had created, but instead laid down an absurd plot from which they had no choice but to become more and more ridiculous."
2,Oh please!!!!!!!!,"I can't say this was a disappointment because I had no great expectations but I did expect a decent read. I found myself skimming the book when Starling was not around. Her character is the most interesting in the series. Hannibal is just unreal. I was bored in Florence and with the details of Lechter's ""superb taste"" It was still salvageable until the end when Harris underwent his full frontal lobotomy which is the only explanation for his ridiculous conclusion. I suspect that he may have done this to ensure that there will not be a movie sequel. The audience would laugh thenselves sick."
2,A sad dissappointment,"How sad to read Hannibal the day of its release and discover that only evil exists in all characters- with no sense of available redemption. Previous Harris books offered this hope. Hannibal does not. Although many characters are sicker than Lecter himself, their sickness is unrealistic. Turning Lecter into a sick saviour of sorts is also hardly satisfying. I will be looking elsewhere for my summer reading thrill. Sally Anne Leger"
1,I was horrified... but for all the wrong reasons,"Why it took Harris so long to complete this crappy book, I have no idea. All he did was throw a rough plot outline and a treatise on abnormal psychology to a ghost writer with the command: ""Fill in the blanks. And make sure it can be adapted to film, cuz that's where the big bucks are."" I was horrified by the result. Other than than the typically overblown narrative, it didn't even read like a Thomas Harris novel. Maybe he and Caleb Carr could get together and produce something worth reading that comes close to their initial successes."
3,"""And they lived happily ever after.""","Although the Author describes himself as ""Verbose"",the success of his novels has proven that many readers enjoy this style of writing as evidenced by the popularity of other authors, such as Clancy,etc.As for this book, specifically, although I enjoyed it, I can't help but feel that an accurate review of Harris should read, ""Author writes 3 parter-- 2 parts Horror Story, and 1 part Fairy Tale."
1,Unpredictable to the last.,"Hannibal was definitely unpredictable to the last. And having just finished it, I wonder if that's such a good thing. It feels like a book written in fits and spurts. Harris pulls a few disconcerting writing tricks in this book, worst of all speaking to us (the reader) directly, breaking the imaginary 'fourth wall'. I didn't find it particularly gruesome or distasteful, only boring. I only finished Hannibal because I had to know what he (Harris) would do to end this mess. Too bad. I should have just stopped. I loved his other books and the highest hopes for Hannibal, buying it the day it came out. I read Silence of the Lambs in one sitting. Hannibal was far too slow to start for that. It is a tragic waste of two of the best literary characters of the late 20th century. I see why Jonathan Demme passed and will bet that both Hopkins and Foster will, too. In fact, I don't see how this will get made into a movie at all. Note to Ridley Scott: RUN!"
4,what a trippy book!,"This was one weird book. I was very into it, though. It didn't take me long to read. I like Harris's deftness at changing tenses and stuff. Yes, I agree that it starts out much more spare and action-ish, (the beginning reminded of 'silence'), and that the middle is really interesting. The ending is where everyone seems to be divided. I thought it was just hallucinatory and surreal and that it really borders on going over the top, but Harris writes it so well that I don't think it does. It is strange, though. And it is going to be really hard to make a film out of. I just can't see the whole denoument with Starling, Lecter and Krendler (interesting dinner party indeed) making it onto film the way its done in the book. Not necessarily cinematic, but this weird book is definitely an involving, very visual, and creepy one."
3,Liked all but the last 3 chapters,"I anxiously awaited this release and was thrilled when the book arrived at my door only 2 days after release via amazon.com. I loved the majority of the book, except for the ending. I felt cheated and very disapointed. Throughout reading the last third of the book, I found myself wondering how Harris was going to tie all of the events together. The plot somewhat indicates that something freaky is likely to take place, so I kind of expected the bizarre, unsettling closure, but still yet, the ending make me ill. It killed the five-star rating I would have assigned to Hannibal. I don't suggest making this into a movie."
2,Empty calories,"I nearly gave this book three stars, but the rather pat explanation for Hannibal's madness and the ridiculous ending really hurt what would otherwise have been an enjoyable read. Mason's character was over the top, but there were some real thrills. I would say the most disappointing aspect of this book, however, is in the way Harris chose to end it. I felt like I was wandering into Anne Rice territory..."
1,Trust me -- it stinks,"Am I the only one who noticed Harris' completely arbitrary-seeming (accidental?) switching from one tense to another, sometimes in a single paragraph? Is Hannibal horrifying? Yes, if you're a grammarian. Otherwise the book is just plain lazy. Lecter presents ""insights"" on Dante that are supposed to dazzle a bunch of professors -- but they're like stuff out of a freshman lit paper. The main thing I learned was that it's bad when dumb people kill deer but it's cool when smart people kill dumb people. I realize that Starling and Lecter belong to Harris and he can do whatever he wishes with them... but the ending is nuts! I hope Mr. Harris enjoys rolling in his enormous stacks of money. I certainly felt like a sucker for contributing. Please note that the glowing NY Times review above was written by Stephen King. He's where I go for literary insight!"
5,"Hair-Raising, Superb Entertainment","What a ghoulish, ghastly, chilling treat this book turned out to be. It was a long wait for ""Hannibal"", but more than worthwhile. I can't think how long it's been since I raced through a book in three days, with my hands seemingly nailed to its covers (Lecter might like *that* image, yes?)--and this was just that kind of book. Mixing icy restraint with jolting shocks, Harris has delivered a book with a great, gruesome story and an ending that'll blow you away....an absolute triumph of perverse logic. I'm thrilled at the job he's done. My hat's off to Thomas Harris."
3,Enjoyable read - but very 'unappetizing',"If it took the author over 10 years to come up with this installment, how many other versions must he have trashed in order to settle on this one? Maybe Mr. Harris should rummage his trash and see if a better Hannibal exists and call it Hannibal II. The bad guys are painted with extremely broad strokes, Starling dissapoints big time, and old Hannibal is somebody you would like to have as a best friend, except for his nasty habits. BUT... a page turner none-the-less Read it for yourself and decide."
3,Good book that would be a terrible movie,"For starters, do not read this book with the preconcieved notion that it will be the equivalent of ""Silence of the Lambs."" It is an interesting book and not a slow read, but does have parts where the writer drifts away from the true story of the book. I would put a slight recommendation on the book. The ending was terrible and if screenwriters decide to adapt this to the big screen there will have to be considerable work done to make it a decent movie. By the way, the ending sucks!"
1,Corny ending unbelievable!,"I saw ""Silence of the Lambs"", then read the book. I was looking forward to the return of Hannibal the Cannibal. However, the ending to Harris's novel 'Hannibal' is so utterly and completely moronic that it ruined the entire reading experience. I don't believe for a moment that the Starling character would act in the way she did in the last part of the novel. Mason Verger and his sister Margot were interesting and creepy, but the entire 'A Long Spoon' section is too stupid to believe. Shame on you Thomas Harris!"
3,Good pulp,"It is impossible to deny that Harris is adept at many of his descriptions of smells and gore - although some of the smell stuff was clearly influenced by Patrick Sueskind's ""The Perfume"" (read that if you like smells. . .). Nevertheless, it is clear that this was written after most of Harris's talent was spent on the previous books. Writers become less careful once they're rich, I guess. Witness the plane ride back to the U.S., for instance. There are no night flights westward on the route he describes, and there never have been, but Harris couldn't resist. Also, what really happened with Mason's nose? The book will hold your interest, but it's sloppy on the edges."
2,Pathetic!,"This book was a sad excuse for a follow up novel. The characters were changed, overdramatic, and lacked any integrity! I so looked forward to reading this book; it turned out to be the biggest disappointment I've ever read."
4,Oh no!,I had anticipated the release of this book ever since I read Silence of the Lambs as a teenager. This book is right up there with Silence of the Lambs until the ending. I felt Harris lost track of who Clarice's character really was. He betrayed her in the worst way. The book was also a bit on the long side but all and all it was an okay read.
4,Exciting,This book is GREAT. I have always enjoyed Thomas Harris' novels. This one is just as good. Harris has you yearning to continue to read further on. It is a book that I could not put down. The ending is the most surprising. But rather than spoil it and tell you I recommend that you take time out and read this book and then see the movie that is coming in February.
1,One of the sickest books ever written,"If it were possible to give minus stars to a review, I would give this book -100. When I finished this piece of TRASH, I wanted to grab Thomas Harris, shake him and ask what the hell he was trying to do. There is NOT ONE likable character in this awful book. Even Clarise Starling turns evil, wicked, mean, bad and nasty. It is full of evil lesbians, horrible mutations of humans, a character who loves to make children cry so he can collect their tears, and unrepetant monsters.It is no wonder that the screenplay will have major revisions in the plot and characters. Jody Foster was absolutely right in refusing to participate in it.The only reason I finished this thing was because I could not believe that it could get any more depraved as it progressed. I was wrong. The ending will make you sick."
2,A very average book 2 and 1/2 stars,"This book isn't terrible but it's just such a dissapointment compared to the Silence of the Lambs. In the Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal was a dangerous threat but in this one Clarice Starling has to save his life. Kind of weird. Also, the book progresses very slowly and just isn't interesting.In this one, Hannibal is loose and everyone is trying to find him. The ending is absolutely horrid and makes no sense. It's such a letdown to me after the brilliant Silence of the Lambs. Read the Silence of the Lambs but forget about this book.If you want a pretty good movie, watch Hannibal the movie. But ONLY IF YOU HAVE A STRONG STOMACH. The movie's a lot better and Ridley Scott's ending is a lot better than Thomas Harris's.You'll be thinking: is this by the awesome author that wrote the amazing Silence of the Lambs? No, it can't be. Oh, yes it is. A major letdown. This book is a mess."
1,Forget this one!,"Disregard the reviews of this book being a must read. It is more of a must pass. The book began well, but then it seemed like Harris just lost his train of thought and started to make things up. The plot was poorly developed and the descriptions of the gory murders, wasn't even disgusting at all.This book was too long and dull. The ending was absolutely horrible. No wonder Jodi Foster refused the part. The characters were lost from the original series to become lovers! This cannot be! It ruins the entire mystique of the relationship between Starling and Lecter! C'mon! Harris, you must've been offered a HUGE advancement to write this shoddy novel. I can't believe you rushed to write this awful book. Warning to others, do not buy unless you want to waste money and time and energy in a dull, predictable book."
2,It took him 10 years to write this?,"I was extremely disappointed. I found this book boring and self indulgent with not a single character worth caring about. The ending was laughable. For a book to be truly griping or scary there needs to be an element of truth. This book is so far out that I found myself saying aloud ""yeah, right"". I hope this is never made into a movie. As written, it is far beneath the talents of Anthony Hopkins and Jody Foster. It reads more like ""Scream"" or ""I know what you did last summer""."
1,"""Hannibal"" is a major disappointment","""Hannibal"" is a major disappointment. Where ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" was about suspense and subtlety, Harris' new book is about pushing the boundaries of tastelessness and trying to incorporate as much sadism and cruelty into the plot as he could muster, as though daring the reader to be sickened or not. The credibility of his two main characters gets marred by an ending that is as preposterous as anything I have recently read. And the short, choppy chapters and even choppier language, suggest this was a project exercised exclusively with an eye towards making money and a movie sale. Except the details are so grotesque I would not want to see them enacted, and Harris' ruination of both Lecter and Starling is so appalling, I would not blame Anthony Hopkins or Jodie Foster for turning the film down. To keep afresh the memory of Harris at his most powerful, revisit 'Silence', or, even better,""Red Dragon."""
2,"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper!","I was very excited about the sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"". However, when I received the book and started to read it I became more and more disenchanted. I feel Mr. Harris did a great injustice to the characters of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. The ending cheapened the entire book for me.I had the feeling Mr. Harris wrote himself into a corner and didn't know where to go from there. I was truly disappointed.By pass this one, and reread ""The Silence of the Lambs""."
1,Horrific morality overlaid on banal plotting,"Harris draws the reader into a morality trap: who deserves the reader's empathy? The answer is no one. Readers are treated to morality lessons from Hannibal Lector and forced to choose between his brand of evil and that of his sixth victim, Mason Verger. Clarice Starling, in the end, also fails as an empathetic character, and the reader is forced to wash the distaste from his or her mouth. In addition, the plotting is predictable except for the ending which lacks verisimilitude. Harris creates one character in Starling and then bends her without foreshadowing into something else just to end this screenplay treatment. It is not worth wasting your time or money on this book."
2,TERRIBLE ENDING,"Great opening scene, gritty and intense. Everything was good, good story line, great explanations and good follow through. Characters seem so real that you associate yourself with them. You understand their motives, their desires and fears. Finished book in one night..so dissapointed at the ending.....one comment to all prospective readers....DON'T READ THE LAST FORTY PAGES IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY THIS NOVEL......"
4,A delicious twist,"Thomas Harris takes the reader where they would never willingly go. While I was surprised at the ending, after much thought it is the logical conclusion of the whole process. Neither character has anyplace else to go. Harris methodically leads the characters into this web and they can't escape. The book surprised me. For that I give it four stars. It certainly avoids the formula ending."
2,It's time to bump old Hannibal Lecter off.,"I just finished reading HANNIBAL and I kept dozing off. The book would fall to the floor and my trusty Amazon.com book mark would fall out. The story line of this novel is so dull that I had a hard time finding which chapter I was trying to read.It's really time to dispatch old Doc Hannibal. If Mr. Harris will promise to get rid of this goof-ball in the next novel, I'll read it.I'm a doctor and Hannibal is starting to remind me of too many of my colleagues.Time to say goodbye, Dr. L."
2,Definitely not up to the Silence of the Lambs.,"I read Silence and was anxious for the thrill, spine tingling suspence created by that novel but was sorely disappointed by Hannibal. It took me half of the novel to get really into the book. So much was wasted in Italy and trying to decipher the wording and reference points given. When the setting of the novel returned to America it was at least understandable and I did not have to keep rereading passages for added understanding. Gore appeared to be added for gore's sake and was more boring than titallating. Definitely a disappointment and I even splurged on the hard cover version"
1,"Big, Big Disappointment","Like so many of the reviews I've read, I agree that this book isn't in the same league with Red Dragon or Lambs. I am saddened to think that a writer of Harris's abilities would sell out to the current rage of violence and gore for its' own sake, instead of to further the plot line, which he accomplished so brilliantly in the other two books. The ending was a complete joke and the entire book a boring waste of my time.I'd give this review zero stars but that wasn't an option!"
2,unreadable,"I put this book down after about 100 pages. Then i saw the movie to confirm that it was terrible. It consists of what Thomas must consider creative violence, but it isn't any more valuable than a Freddy or Jason sequel. This story offeres nothing above a very low gross out level. Its not a psychological thriller. Its simply cat and mouse, and playing violent tricks. SOTL is better paced, seemingly unconcerned with cramming in shockers, and filled with what seems to be psychological insight. This book has little to none of that."
1,BORING,"This was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I wonder how much they paid Stephen King to comment on the cover about how great this book was. I hope Thomas Harris' other books aren't this bad. I enjoyed the ""Silence of the Lambs"" movie, but after reading this book, I won't be seeing the sequel. If the book is this bad, the movie will be horrible. Sorry, Thomas Harris, but this was about as exciting as watching paint dry."
1,What a terrible book.,"The book is overrated. WAY overrated. Pretentious, silly, and completely UNscary. A waste of my time. W/a horrible ending. Please do NOT read this book. Boy, was I disappointed."
1,Simply Dreadful: Burn This Book!,"As they used to say on Saturday Night Live: rredeemably Bad! I didn't care much for either the book or film version of Silence of the Lambs, with its ludicrously-named protagonists 'Hannibal the Cannibal' and 'Jame Gumb', but this alledged sequel was ridiculous, vile, and an insult to the intelligence of the reader. An appalling waste of paper and ink. My choice for Worst Novel of 1999."
1,"Movie Is Better..,","I swear, that this book i awfull. I wasn't much of a fan for the first book. But this was horribale and more confusing. I think Thomas Harris Could've done better.If you Liked This Book check out the movie, soundtrack, The Silince Of The Lambs & Red Dragon also By Thomas Harris."
3,"Hannibal the ""Hero""?","Who would have thought you would be rooting for Hannibal? That's about what says it all. How Hannibal is honorable cannibal who is just mis-understood. I would have never thought he would be turned into the ""hero"" but that is exactly what has happened here. And one of his victims is the real villian? Starling traveling the world with him as his ""love interest""? Come on! It's a total departure from the original story line and not very believeable at that.The book isn't a total waste of time - I had to read it to see where all of it was going. But if you're looking for something will scare you, forget it."
2,Hard to Swallow,"I consider myself well-educated, experienced and cognizent of the finer things life has to offer, but this novel over-indulges itself, just as its ""hero"", Lecter, does, in tedious descriptions of gourmet food,(yeah, that type of ""food"" too.., medieval literature and art, expensive cars, and other ephemera of the ultra-rich.) Basically, I got bored with it all. Still, I finished reading ""Hannibal"", mainly to see what happens to ""Starling"". Even so, the ending will likely gross out the reader(not ""amuse in a certain contex"", to paraphrase Lecter, who seems to speak for the author here) and Starling's actions were unquestionably out of character and hard to believe. No wonder Jody Foster refused the sequel's role..."
3,I thought It was only me.,"I am glad to find that I am not the only person disapointed in this latest Harris novel. I too, found the ending to be quite tame. It certainly was not up to Harris' caliber. I did enjoy the decriptions of Florence, they brought back fond memories of a great trip."
3,"Too sadistic, but riveting","There were pages I had to skip past because I couldn't handle the goriness (and I'm not generally a wimp). I didn't like the way Clarice was turned almost into a buffoonish character (i.e., no dignity to be had as reporters snap pictures while she gets a speeding ticket; a senseless petty theft leaving her helpless in a supermarket and looking a little foolish). I didn't like seeing Clarice looking like a fool. On the other hand, a character like Hannibal Lecter can not NOT be fascinating. That alone kept me rivetted to the book and let me overlook it's flaws. I was (like in Silence of the Lambs) obsessively compelled to try to figure out how his mind was working."
4,Hannibal the Loveable?,"I thought this book was rather good. I did learn much about Florence, Italy and many other things. This book produced a person who was more evil than Dr. Lecter. This book makes you cheer for Hannibal and hope he gets out of certain situations. Now, about the ending. The last few chapters had me thinking about love in the air and I guess I was right. I do recommend this book to anyone who loves a good old maniac who is smarter than the world around him."
5,"Absolutely Amazing, by anyone's standards","I have already read ""Hannibal"" 5 times, and I must say that it is the best book of this trilogy. It's a shame that Jodie Foster has turned down the offer to reprise her role as Clarice. But, with that notwithstanding, I'm sure the movie is going to be as good as the book. I like the unique idea of revenge that Mason has in store for the good dottore. I also like the way Harris gives us insight into the characters and what their agendas are. What I like the most is the probable cause of why Lecter is how he is. I dont want to spoil the book, but, lets say it's very unique. The accuracy of the layout of Florence is nothing short of perfection, and this book is the absolute best way of closing out a chilling trilogy of a ""treasure dive"" into the human psyche, though this is far from a treasure dive. Simply a must read."
2,Big Let Down!,The only thing positive I can say is that I'm glad I resisted the urge to buy it in hardcover when it first came out. The style seemed to jump all over the place. The characters were a disappointment. I felt very odd indeed to be pulling for Hanibal to get away and disappointed to read that Clarice turned out not to be a strong woman afterall.
2,Like having to look at a car wreck....,"I just couldn't help myself. After getting about half-way through, I found myself compelled to read on to the silly end. The plot loses its way and gets messy. Giving Lecter's character a reason for his behavior served no purpose other than pandering to the human need to give motives to horrific acts. Lecter was better as a personality mutation making an artistic statement than a victim who's damaged childhood drives him to kill."
1,I waited ten years for this?!,"Never before has the ending of a book totally ruined my reading experience before Hannibal. I got to the point where I couldn't wait for it to end. It just seemed to get more and more ridiculous as it went along.The best thing I can say about the book is that Harris certainly has a way with character development. Whether you like them or not, the characters in Hannibal are well developed, interesting and memorable, even if the story wasn't.Where have you gone Thomas Harris?"
3,Disappointing,"While some parts of the story werecompelling, the central plot was contrived. It was like Harris rackedhis brain for a sadistic torture that he could incorporate into the story to top ""Silence of the Lambs"". The ending of the story was preposterous. It's a shame, first Larry McMurtry sells out to write pure gore, now Harris."
4,Great book with odd (as in unbelievable) ending,"I stayed up until 1:30 to finish reading the book, and am still not quite sure if it was worth my time. On the whole, i thought the book was well written, and the story was interesting. Most interesting was Mason Verger who actually seemed to upstage Hannibal as the guy you love to hate. I actually found myself pulling for Hannibal towards the end. The end was a shocker, and it will be interested to see if the movie will take the same turn..."
3,Very entertaining with an unpredictable ending,A very good book that is not as much of a pure thriller as one would expect. It is a testament to Thomas Harris' skill that he could create a scenario where Dr. lecter is seen as distinctly sympathetic compared to a creation of malevolent evil driven by calculated revenge. A good book - not a great one though.
4,"Excellent sequel, but a cop-out ending!","This book had me turning pages so fast, my fingers felt hot; I wondered if the pages would burst into flame. All the way until the end, when I felt betrayed! After almost two complete books covering not just Hannibal Lecter, but Clarice Starling, Thomas Harris wrote an ending which went completely counter to the person - personality, morals, ethics, and integrity - with which he built our favorite FBI agent. It just felt wrong."
1,Perhaps the worst book ever written.,"Superficial motives, unbelievable scenes, a prodding plot and weak grammar combine to make one of the worst reading experiences I have ever had. The appeal of Harris' earlier books, a quick peek into distorted minds, is lost here. We see to far in, and discover characters without a drop of subtelty."
3,Disappointing,"I think that Hannibal Lector should be admired for his intelligence, but cautiously approached because he is a monster. The book had too many monsters. No major character in the book was redeemable. Even Clarice Starling became a monster. Unfortunately, in this book Hannibal Lector's monstrous presence can not compare with the pedifile Mason Verger and his murderous sister. I found myself cheering for Lector and sickened by the fact that I was. The last four chapters left a bad taste in my mouth, and the only charater that I liked at the end was Ardelia."
5,Enjoyed it to the Last Page,"Hannibal is one of the most vivid and interesting novels I have ever read. You end up caring about certain characters, while passionately hating others. This novel is not for the weak of heart (or stomach for that matter). The best thing about the third novel in the Lecter trilogy, is that it is not the same as The Red Dragon (Manhunter) and Silence of the Lambs (though both are also good novels)."
1,I'm Smart (Harris) You (reader) Are STUPID,"One thing not touched upon in these reviews is the way Harris (through Lecter) constantly reminds the reader how dumb they are compared to great minds like Lecter. The book is pretentious in the extreme, more of a class in antiquities and cooking than anything suspenseful. So, dear reader, you can't cook with white truffles? Too bad for you. The tone of the book is snotty and lets the reader feel his/her inferior education at every turn. And how does the incredibly superior Lecter fall afoul of his enemies? When Interpol and the FBI can't find him for seven years, he gets grabbed in a Safeway parking lot by a carful of goons. Does this make any sense? No, but it needed to happen for the sake of the alleged plot.One has a feeling this was written in just a few months. It is unedited and has a first draft quality. Mistakes that wouldn't get by in a freshman English class are on every page.Overall, Hannibal insults the reader. Save your $$. Pure junk."
1,I had to reach the end of the book- but regretted it,"I thought this was one of the worst books that I have read in a long time. It seemed contrived and pretentious. It took short cuts that took out all the tension, and ended on a truly simple and trivial manner."
1,Harris took the money and ran,"Thomas Harris obviously got tired of the publishers and public asking when the next Hannibal Lecter novel would appear, so he produced this load of garbage. Hopefully this will be the last one. Readers who enjoyed the first 2 books would be better off if they read MESSIAH by BORIS STARLING or THE PSALM KILLER by CHRIS PETIT."
1,Who wrote this and why?,"After considering Thomas Harris' earlier works as exceptional entertainment, I found I had an exceptionally difficult time even getting through this book. One wonders if the same person wrote it as the writing styles seemed to change throughout -- sometime in the normal third person and sometimes as the all-knowing narrator -- making the book extremely difficult to read. Probably the biggest disappointment was in how the author chose to end this novel. After giving us exceptionally strong characters in ""Silence of the Lambs"", these same characters rolled over and died without a fight(sometimes literally) in the sequel. If Thomas Harris was seeking contraversy, he hit the mark. If he was seeking a quality novel, he went off course about a third of the way through. Bottom line: don't waste your time."
2,Disappointing,"With Harris's talent at description and pace, I was looking forward to this sequel. ""Hannibal"" starts out well, with Starling well rounded out and changed in the seven years that have passed. Somewhere around the middle, the plot starts to falter, and the characters begin to act as if they were in a cartoon rather than a novel. By the end, readers have landed squarely in the Land of the Prepostorous. I could almost sense Harris losing interest in his book as it continued, and the nice, neat ending tied up in a pink bow is almost insulting. It's a shame that two such interesting and stimulating characters as Starling and Lector have been reduced to intellectualized romantic trash novel characters."
5,Good - but not as good as American Psycho,"Harris's novel is like Silence of the Lambs but worse ... he's guilty of committing the cardinal sin of repeating himself, and making the opportunity of writing a great sequel nothing more than a joke. It's like a movie sequel which has no chance of living up to the original. It doesn't engage with anything more than a post-modernist's masturbatory fixation upon violence without cause or reproach. American Psycho, in all its minimalist glory rips it to pieces (no pun intended). Shame really, once again the hype betrays the product. Mind you, the way things normally go .... the next novel should be infinitely better."
