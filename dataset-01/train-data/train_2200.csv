3,"Beautiful, but not my favorite to play","I own 8 recorders, 6 of them sopranos. Comparing this one to others in the price range...Cons: The 2 Yamaha recorders I own both exhibit a lot of breath ""noise"" that is not consistent from one note to the next. (The other Yamaha I own is a less expensive model with a straight windway.)Pros: The finish is very pleasing, even better than pictured. The case is nicely done from cloth with a zipper and the rod and cream are useful. I like the way it fingers and it offers a reasonable breath resistance that is pleasant to play.Conclusion: In this price range I think the Aulos is superior in fit and sound quality. Check out the Aulos 503B and 703B before considering this one. Aulos makes a wood-tone one (703Bw) if that is important to you."
3,"Not a bad recorder, but not worth the money.","I bought this based on recommendations of recorder teachers. Although it is not a bad instrument, it is certainly not worth $25. I have a recorder that I bought for $3 from a music store, that is just as good as this one. I also was hoping the wood grain would look a little bit more realistic, it looks very fake. I prompty returned this item. Instead, for just a little bit more money I bought a Hohner Wooden recorder, hoping for a nicer sound."
1,Completely dissatisfied with this Camera Housing,"I've bought this housing at B&H photo, in NYC, to take my camera to a kayaking trip down the delaware. Unfortinately I was unable to do so, not only did it have a hole through which water was able to get inside, the line along which the two plastic pieces are stitched together came apart when I tried to put the camera in. I got a feeling that a ziplock would protect my camera better than this bag. I brought it back for a full refund, the next day."
1,Too brilliant for me,"This is the last time that I'm going to try to read a book that the critics describe as brilliant. I might have known that it would go over my head. It did give me a sense of traveling down the Danube River and of the rich culteral background of the aria. I wish I had copied down every name that the writer dropped ,to look up later. Then I would have learned something. This is clearly an aria of the world of which my knowledge is sourly dificient. About 80% of the book, though, didn't make any sense to me. I am herewith sending out a plea to all book reviews. Please use reviewers with average intelligence, not eggheads."
2,don't like it,This book doesn't really tell me what I wanted to know. It arrived smelling like cigarette smoke and it suppose to be brand new.
4,Great Value,"I went to Ritz(wolf) to get the F401 after seeing the price on Amazon. I had to pay tax but got some free software(Picaso) which was very good for arranging photos, etc. The cradle is handy and allows you to use the camera as a high quality webcam.At 199 it is pretty hard to beat. The telephoto is very easy to use the menu is less easy but OK. It is far better than the Olympus Digital 280 I had before. The rechargeable batteries and cradle make it very cheap and easy to operate. It also takes 90 second AVI movie clips and allows narration. The small size allows you to fit it in a shirt or jacket poctet."
2,DAMAGED PRODUCT BUT THEY TOOK CARE OF IT,I RECEIVED THE CAMERA AND IT WAS DAMAGED WHEN I CONTACTED THEM THEY SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY MORE OF THAT SPEC. ITEM BUT THEY WOULD SEND ME A RETURN SHIPPING LABEL AND THEY DID WHAT THEY SAID IT WAS GREAT SERVICE.
1,THE GOOD CAMERA THAT WASNT,"Well, the camera is apparently a very popular fuji brand. However, when I purchased my camera (brand new) the LCD view finder monitor didnt even work! Production on the particular item has long ceased, which makes it vertially impossible to fix or replace. So, if you want to take a coin toss chance on spending your hard earned money, be my guest. I did, and lost!"
5,Fujifilm FinePix F401 2.1MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,"Take outstanding outdoor photos. Easy to use, aim and shoot. I highly recommend the Fujifilm FinePix F401 to new users of digital cameras."
1,!!JUNK!!~DO NOT GET THIS~,had it for 1 DAY then the problems started!!!! It cant take pictures anymore i dont know what the problem is but the pictures are never good its all black with messed up green blobs and no picture at all....and the people that answer calls for fuji are no help at all!!get something diffrent
1,Horrible quality,"Had a problem with recharging the camera (not a battery problem, defective camera). Attempted to use the warranty: after hours spent on the phone with unhelpful Fuji staff, after months of waiting, after Fuji not returning the battery (took 6 weeks to get it back), we got a beat up refurbished camera back!!! It broke within a week!!!! Thanks for nothing, Fuji."
3,Never got to use it.,Mine won't be the greatest of reviews as the camera I ordered arrived in non-working condition and I had to get a refund... Whether it is a really good camera or a bad one I simply cannot say as I never had the chance to use it. Sorry.
5,post-hardcore can be quite impressive,"not that a canadian living in alaska has much to say about an american east coast band that doesn't tour, i still gave this e.p. a five star because the song writing and lyrics will grip your mind and you will be humming their hooks for days if not weeks."
3,A caveat regarding the First Concerto,"Buy this score for the Second or Third concertos, not the First.Dover has made a serious mistake in reprinting what it claims is a 1960s Russian printing of the First Piano Concerto. The edition here simply isn't the standard version of the 1917 revision of the concerto. At the same time, it isn't the original version, either. Structurally, it seems to be identical to the revised version, but much of the piano figuration (I'm unsure about the orchestral part) is based on the original version. I have no idea how this hybrid came about - perhaps it was compiled from an intermediate version in the revision process, or perhaps it was created by the publisher. At any rate, it's not much use in studying the modern version of this concerto.Boosey has published the First Concerto together with the Second. This score (ISBN 9780851624440) is excellent, highly readable, and available at a very reasonable price from this sitehere."
3,Not for the Pianist,"This edition has the full orchestra music as well as the piano music. But, all staffs are so tiny that you really can't do that much with it."
1,Horrible packaging,"While the product itself is great, two of the six tins arrived with the tops opened and the paprika spilled all over the box. Amazon says that the item is non-returnable. Caveat emptor."
4,"A glimpse of eternity, through fantasy, with a liberal dose of reality","An excellent story, with a touch of James Michener. Employing a combination of suspense, tragedy and triumph, the author leads us through a story culminating in, what could best be described as a glorious conclusion, which transcends our secular existence. If you are an avid recreational reader, this is a must read."
4,Easy to hold,I bought a few of these with my third child. He immediately took to them. They were very easy for him to hold. I also had the regular round bottles that he always seemed to turn sideways and I would always have to keep checking and fixing the bottle when he drank. The only con I found was that you had to rinse or wash the bottle right away or you would sometimes find you could'nt always get the inside bottom clean (even with a bottle brush). This was sometimes a nuisance when we were out for the day doing errands.
2,Not so great...,"I am a piper from California, and while this album is not too bad, I have heard much better. In track 6, Amazing Grace, The band does not 'come in' or 'go out' at the same time, creating a nasty sound. And ask any piper, Amazing Grace is a highly overrated tune... Track 9 is titled: Pio Braireachd, which is a bad misspelling of Piobaireachd (pibroch in English, 'ch' as in loch). Piobaireachd is a Gaelic word, and is a very respected, and traditional form of Highland Pipe music. Most Piobaireachd are around ten minutes in length, this track is only around five minutes. Not only is this not a traditional Piobaireachd, but the piper who is playing it is not blowing his pipes hard enough, there is a 'crow', or a screeching like noise, in the high A, or the highest note on the Highland Pipes. Not an album I would buy after hearing it."
1,Horrendus!,"This album is simply awful. I was looking for some scottish vibes but I really don't want to be listening to this terible screechy music. It is painful to my ears, and I strongly recommend that you NOT buy it. Instead, If you want something irish, try LOREENA MCKENNITT. (...)."
5,Soft and reliable !!,"I have been buying these for a few years and finaly broke away from Plastic kotex. Glad rags makes very soft and absorbant pads, I never have a problem with staining or leaks , I use a soaker pot and find this with enzymes helps with stains.If you want to do your part to save the enviroment= or even your own health , or save money over the long haul of your menstral cycle - these are a great investment overall !!"
2,Great at first and then...,"I have had this spoon for 5 months now. I love the weight of it and how it feels. However, after 5 months of use and despite my TLC it is starting to split in the middle. I have always hand washed it and have oiled it. The HIC (ASIN: B001APLJYK : HIC Harold Imports Olive Wood Spoon 12-Inch) spoon that I bought at the same time is still in pristine condition. I guess you get what you pay for. Go for the solid olive wood."
1,Not any good!,"Well, the ""small"" spoon isn't very small. Not small at all, in fact it's the same size as all the other spoons I already had, making the medium and large ones that I also got, just ridiculously big. So - not good for small portions. And it's hard to clean, food sticks to it like a magnet. Even after washing, it feels gritty, not smooth, like there's still food stuck in the wood. As if the wood wasn't treated properly. But most horrific of all? There's a giant crack down the center of the spoon. I used it maybe three times and it cracked. Not acceptable."
4,it's a spoon........,"i gave it to my mom for Christmas. meh, if it's not a spoon it's at least very spoon-like. i'm fairly certain it's a spoon though........"
2,Stylish but won't last,This wooden spoon feels right in your hand but it's made of a very soft wood that won't pass the test of time. :(
1,Wooden spoon,The minute we used this spoon we found that at the end of our meal the entire spoon was cracked. This didn't last long.I would not order this spoon again.
2,pretty good for a while,"These are nice looking and easy to use, BUT they are so narrow at the tip that the tips of two of my spoons broke off while I was stirring. Both times we were expecting company and I had to make the embarrassing announcement that there was a lost piece of wood somewhere in the food and to chew carefully. :( I would recommend using a different brand!"
1,Tried it twice not worth it,"Thought this would be a great deal, nope, the first spoon cracked after I made a pot of chili. I ordered a replacement thinking it was just the luck of the draw and it was defective.Second time using the spoon it too cracked.Oiled and hand washed and ...not worth it."
2,Spoon's surface gets rough quickly,"We have used it little, but it's surface is noticably rough to the touch, surprisingly so. I can't think I'd want to get out sandpaper 1x/month, but I just may do that!"
1,Came in mail with chunk of wood out of it,"Apparently, packager of this spoon did not look at it. There was a piece of wood missing from the top left side, and could not justify the trouble of sending it back as it was not enough money to do so. Just went out and purchased another one."
4,Love the spoon,"We love the spoon. The size and depth of the spoon head is great. The handle is comfortable and easy to hold during use. It did not come as entirely raw wood; I believe it was slightly oiled. However, considering to amount of use it gets in our kitchen, it falls a little short. I have simply applied the wood oil I have for our wooden cutting boards and it's now even better. I highly recommend this spoon for the active kitchen."
4,rare glimpse of a legend,"A rare insight of ""lockjaw"" live in an intimate setting. The bassist and pianist are not american, but definitly hold their own. Ed Thigpen, on drums rounds out the trio. The picture and sound are very good and Eddie is in good form."
5,The future is here!,"The book is excellent, but the Cyber Classroom pushes it to the next level. Surely this is the future of instruction! I am a physicist who is switching to a career in programming and I have seen teaching at its worse and driest. The Cyber Classroom is a breath of fresh air."
4,Really handy,"This is a very handy tool, you can use when traveling or simply use it at home. Charges faster than the USB cable. The only thing that made this four star us that the product I received differed from the one in the picture, but it's still great."
4,All-Around a Good Book,"This book was helpful with sparking new ideas. It provided a well-rounded description of publishing, the interaction of distributors with sales reps, bookstores, chains, special sales, etc. It one thing it didn't really provide, at least not enough to my liking, was a detailed description of what goes into a press kit, how to write a press release, etc. If I gave this book to an entry-level person in publishing, I would feel like they need another resource to show them how to write a press release and marketing copy, how to put together a press kit, etc."
5,A strong foundation,"The book industry is changing so fast it takes some moxy to even try summarizing publishing, distributing, and marketing tactics, knowing that much of what is written will be somewhat out-of-date by the time the book is published (or shortly thereafter). The Complete Guide to Book Marketing offers a strong foundation of information concerning the more traditional aspects of book distribution and marketing. When read with a companion book, such asPlug Your Book: Online Book Marketing for Authors, Book Publicity through Social Networking(which does just the opposite), the more comprehensive picture is revealed. The importance of a strong foundation cannot be stressed enough and that is where this book shines. Brent Sampson, author ofSelf-publishing Simplified: Experience Your Publishing Dreams With Outskirts Press"
5,Good simple instructions on Book Marketing,"The beginning of the book really sets the tone and expanse of the book, namely that a book marketing strategy should select and find methods that result in a profitable book. Cole then lays out in a very simple and easy to follow and implement way how it all starts. Like how the cover of the book is important, something you need to think about before you print them--it ties into the sales. The handling of publicity and advertising and all torwards getting sales of your book. Advertising needs to produce a certain affect and he tells you how. Very useful instruction to sell books."
3,A marketing must,As an author I found this a highly informative read but I'm sure it can be a big help for anyone selling anything. This will be a help to the old and new ant the marketing game.Dave[...]
3,it's okay,"i have a feeling that the series is going to be something like dawson's creek...but this one is okay..but has no point..there's a scholarship and tia, maria and melissa are nominated..Ken and Elizabeth are two of the judges..ken has to choose between melissa and maria..tough choice huh? yeah right..jade and evan is on their way to hook up..and elizabeth has to defeat her own jealousy to choose tia or maria for the scholarship..and jade's dad is coming to town.. basically, this book's about choosing what's important for each character.."
3,O.K movie,"This movie is o.k, so I rated it a three out of five. It's about a girl named Rebecca who's step father wants her to become famous on the radio. But when she dosen't make it, she sends her to her Ant Maranda's house. Then she has lots of fun and even meets the director of the radio program himself! She ends up ON the radio and sings beautiful songs. It's a an ok movie if you're in love with Rebecca."
1,Not 'Beyond Awful' -- but getting there...,"A few of these are a pleasant enough listen -- the Lennon solo material mostly -- and a few are truly bad -- especially the ones with drums added, and the early material such as ""She Loves You"" which hardly merit this kind of approach.The worst rip-off is that this is a 2-CD set that clocks in at just over ONE HOUR of music -- it could easily have fitted on one disc with quite a bit of room to spare. That's just plain greedy."
1,Beyond Awful,"Calling this collection of songs amateurish is an insult to amateur musicians. The so-called musicianship is dreadful, the arrangements uninspired (i.e., dull) and the recording/sound clipped and compressed.To my ears, it sounds that at least some (if not all) of the song parts are created by using MIDI sequencers. That in itself is not the end of the world, but the arrangements are simplistic enough to not challenge even a middle school student quartet.Yes, The Beatles are great. Real chamber music is great as well, but avoid this lame potboiler ""tribute"" like the plague."
3,GREAT GIFT,"I gave it to my dad for a holiday present and he loved it, as i enjoyed listening to it to."
5,Very nice.,"Warning: This is an EASY book. If you want diminished and augmented chords with a roiling bass line you most out of luck. Nice and big notes, lyrics etc. Mostly for beginners, but still fun for KR fans (remember Kenny Rogers' Roasters chicken? bet you don't)."
5,One of my favorite poets,"I keep this book on my bedside table, where it is always ready to lift my spirits. I bought two copies this year as Christmas gifts."
5,Why I Wake Early,It was worth the price of the book for the opening poem about morning sun. Mary Oliver continues to be an inspiration.
5,Thought provoking word,"Mary Oliver's poetry is such a deep treat - like sitting down with a favorite cup of tea & something good to eat in the midst of a busy day. Her words run deep, yet are easy & great food for thought! I hope to acqquire all of her works. Thanks. Mary Ann Cauthen"
5,Connections woven in language,"Mary Oliver not only observes the natural world around here but finds language to express its many moods and meanings, linking them to her outer and inner life. The ""simple"" cadences of her lines carry a hidden depth to them. Well worth reading and meditating upon."
5,Spirituality in nature,When I read Mary Oliver's poems I feel like I'm walking with her in the early morning light. Her reverance for nature and appreciation of God's gifts to humankind speak to me.
3,too many exclamation points,"when inspiration fails, emphasis and repetition feel the void.strengh needs no boasting.true happiness is best implied - not proclaimed.one senses Mary Oliver's old mastery- alas waning in a forest of exclamation points..."
2,Okay - check it out from the library,I found that I really enjoyed about three or four of the poems. Otherwise it just wasn't right for me.
3,don't bother,"it doesn't live up to its promised capabilities. still has bugs. rendering animations is a problem. initial purchasers helped get many bugs fixed thru beta testing forum. some promised features are still all but usless(face room). some of the pro pack export functions to other programs are now non-existant. no new fixes to allow it to take advantage of newer computer capabilities (open gl etc). still a good prog for making stills only but i had poser n pro pack for that. sorry i bought it at the moment, waiting to see if another service pack comes out.hoping that the daz studio program turns out to be better."
1,The negative reviews are quite correct.,"If you're trying to work with decent-sized props, backgrounds, etc, you're going to be fighting with this software all the way. Really frustrating. The non-intuitive interface is bad enough, but the insanely long renders for the average machine (1 gig processor here) make this impossible to use. If you need humans in your renderings, make the human in poser--nowhere else to do so, thus we're stuck with it--and then export as an object file and open in Bryce. Bryce annihilates poser in the rendering and working with objects area. This software is a big letdown--can't wait till someone else comes up with a human-modeling program so I can put this in the garbage where it belongs."
4,fun software to play with,I have used this software and have created a lot of computer generated photos with it. It was easy and fun.
2,The sinking ship!,"Some of the writers here may me shocked, but Poser 5 is the reason, why Curious Labs is now a sinking ship! This software is full of bugs and the render times are much too long. Two companies now show a reaction and publish their own software: DAZ Studio and Horus3D. When you look at the website of Horus3D, you'll see that a Vicky3-Figure can be raytraced within 3 Seconds with transparency! Poser? How long do you need to do this? So nobody should tell me, that Poser 5 is that slow, because it isn't possible to be faster! The main-programmers of Curious Labs has left the company after the Poser 5 disaster. The community of Poser is really fed up with this version and all it's patches!"
1,No serial number,"Bought Poser 5, got it, no serial number inside. The area in the CD packet where the serial is suppose to be, is blank. The person responsible for putting in the serial numbers on the assembly line must have been asleep. Sent an email to Curious Labs, no reply yet. Can't even look at the program without providing a serial number. Can't return the item either as the CD packet is open now because that's where the Serial Number is suppose to be at. Money down the drain so far and not very happy at the moment."
3,make sure you know what you buy!,"Curious Labs does not allow resale of this software, so make sure you know what you buy. They shut down auctions on Ebay."
1,"Even on a high end machine, WORTHLESS","I went out, and got myself a 2.53 GHz machine with a gig of DDR memory, more than enough to handle Poser 5, and all its patches, right?Think again, parameter dials go out when they feel like it, when trying to adjust body parts, and you will not be able to re-adjust your model even after saving your work. And nobody is lying when they say parts of the program don't work. The face room doesn't work, cloth I won't even try, and the hair room works only if you are using to apply gravity effects to pre existing hair.I'm hoping whoever buys the Curious Labs will have the programming ability and integrity to fix the program, and to sack the people who mostly sold a bill of goods to the public. I think perhaps instead I should have invested in a more reliable program from a more reliable outfit.If you already have the pro pack, you do not need to buy the only thing this program has brought me, aggravation."
3,"Good, but still not the best","Basically, Poser is still not as good as ""professional"" 3-D programs. Its system requirements are higher than Lightwave or 3-D Studio Max. It (still) does not use OpenGL or hardware-acceleration for rendering or previewing models. Even though the system requirements state that it can be used under Windows 98, do not even try it- Windows 98's memory management can't even handle Poser 4's renders.The ""advanced features"" (Hair Room, Cloth Dynamics, Face Room) seem to be corrected in the latest service pack. However, unlike Poser Pro Pack, Paser 5 has *no* support for exporting scenes to 3-D Studio Max, Bryce, Vue, or Lightwave. The new ""materials room"" is more powerful, but much more complicated to use. The ""Firefly"" render engine gives mixed results- for some people, the texture maps aren't as sharp. For other, the renders are nice and crisp.If you purchase this program, be absolutely sure you keep up with the updates and Service Packs.[...]"
1,Too many problems,"The software does not work. After many re-installations, I gave up. After launching the program, it crashes. I discovered after running scandisk, there's an array of invalid files, in the female folder. Tried to repair error and didn't work. The patch SR4 doesn't solve the problem. Wrote to customer service about the problem and no answer from them. I won't buy anything else from this company and I'll look somewhere else for a more reliable, friendly and committed company to their customers."
3,Good buy,I really like this book. The cover design really grabbed my attention.Good clear advice on photography mainly for beginner photographers. The scrapbook projects in the second half of the book are definitely inspiring. Unfortunately no step by step guidelines which makes it a bit challenging to duplicate some of them at least for a novice scrapbooker (I've been doing it a couple of years and still found some of the projects complicated).All in all the book layout itself is full of ideas and great photos to look at!
3,I want MORE!,"I'm one of the people that hasall the ""albums"" ... Now, I'mhoping to get them all on CD...Me quiere actualizar. It's goodold-school salsa with a -little punchVaya"
5,I Highly Recommend This Ink!,"I purchased this ink approximately a week ago. So far, I haven't run into any issues yet. The ink works great. I purchased the same brand ink from the same seller in different colors, and it is absolutely worth it! I saved nearly $60 buying this brand instead of Epson brand, and it works just as good if not better!"
4,Why pay more?,"These black inkjet cartridges work just as well as the Epson version. Recommended.Note: If you need color catridges for an Epson printer, stick to the Epson brand."
1,bad cartridges,"cartridges leaked and were not really compatible. Not consistent packaging, some were oval shaped."
5,absolute delight,This C.D. made me feel that I was right in Havana in a cafe right by the ocean:just like the title. Along with the heat and continual rhythm you feel the sprayfrom the ocean hitting the rocks.Havana Cafe
1,Don't fall for it,"I bought this battery a couple months ago for my Powershot S45 since it was so much cheaper than the real NB-2L. PLEASE! Do not make the same mistake. The first few uses were fine and it appeared to be a genuine equivalent. However, after about 10 uses, the battery life was completely sapped. It now takes just a few shots after a ""full charge"" before I hit the low battery indicator. Of course, my original Canon battery is still fine after many uses. I highly recommend sticking with the real thing."
3,Ok for price paid.,"Had to borrow a friends camera as a back up for a gig I did - needed some spare batteries, I ended up buying these based on price and previous Lenmar experience.They seemed to charge well and held charge well enough for what I used it for, however one of the batteries I got would not fit in the slot like it should - it would not engage the ""lock"" that holds the battery in place, you had to keep your finger on the battery while shutting the compartment lid. Once in it worked fine. Go figure.Other than that little glitch it seems like good batteries, considering I paid 7.50 for each I don't think I'll complain - its a bargain for canon compatible batteries (I've paid upward 50 bucks for my regular camera batteries)."
5,Same Battery at a Great Price!!!!,This is the perfect battery to have as a replacement for canon cameras. Lenmar is a generic but a good generic not like the others you find saturated everywhere. The company gave me great service and shipped it in a timely matter. I would say to buy from this retailer without any hesitation.
4,Real New England Fish Chowder,"Just like i enjoys as a kid. Made with haddock, and no fillers (starch...) or preservatives. Just add cream and buitter"
3,Not All That Authentic,"Well, if I was expecting something from the No Name Restaurant, I was slightly disappointed. This isn't the greatest fish chowder I've had in my life. I think I could use less milk than I have been."
2,Took a gamble and lost,"I saw the line of Bar Harbor products in my local store. Being an enthusiast of chowder, I bought a can of the Fish Chowder and brought it home to have for supper. Much to my surprise, the can does not suggest how much milk/cream to mix into the concentrate to get it right. Instead, the directions say only ""...add milk or cream to desired consistency..."" So I followed the suggestion in this Amazon product review (a half-pint: why not call it a cup instead?)and now have chowder that is thin. I am wondering how many cans must I buy and waste at $4 per to solve the proper amount of milk or creme to add?Jerry"
5,Loveable Storytime Christmas Bear,"I bought this bear for my 2 year old niece for Christmas and received it very fast. She loves anything that has buttons you can push to get something to move or talk. Of course, she just loves this bear. It has the best ""Grandpa"" voice that reads you the entire 'The Night Before Christmas' story. The bear is so incredibly soft and it sways from side to side as the story is read. I would definitely recommend this bear to anyone!"
1,storybook bear,"The bear recited the night before Christmas twice and never worked again. The screw is stripped and we cannot unscrew it, so we could put batteries in the bear to see if that was the problem."
5,great bear,"I have given four of the Storytime Christmas bears as gifts--plus one for me, of course. Three went to my adult daughters and one to my mother, who loved it. Gund makes great products and this made a great gift for them all."
3,Good but with Errors...,"The idea is good. Execution is ok. Although Lincoln is in the title, he shows up fairly rarely. But Churchill is covered quite well. Humes makes several interesting observations about public speaking, which most are first day stuff at any Toastmasters. However, there are many hints are the little things that I'm sure most public speakers know about but don't often think about (e.g. pausing, showmanship, etc.) Many of the quotes are noteworthy, but my biggest beef is with not being sure the quotes are correct. I gave this three stars because he quotes Ronald Reagan as saying, ""Tear down that wall"" when Reagan actually said, ""Tear down this wall."" Albeit minor, such errors should not be overlooked and ultimately damage the overall effectiveness of the text."
2,Not that helpful for my situation,"I have no doubt that this will be valuable for the manager who has to ""rally the troops"" or ""kill that presentation"" for upper management, but for most of us, this is just interesting anecdotes that provide examples of rules that mostly cannot, and should not be applied to most work situations."
4,It's all about power,"Each chapter of the book is divided into chapters that start with the word power. It's a power pause, or a power word. Excuse the overuse of the word, but the thoughts are very powerful for anyone wishing to improve their public speaking skills, writing skills, and presentation skills.Brevity, the use of a quote, silence, eye-contact, the use of a meaningful statistic, humor, lessons, and more; nearly everything one needs to learn about the power of words is in this book.One would think that a book like this is a guaranteed nighttime-read, one that is sure to induce sleep. On the contrary, this book has several interesting tidbits, historical facts, and quotes that are meaningful and entertaining.This book is a tool; it is a great read that should be in public speaking classes across the nation."
4,good solid item,"I ordered this changing pad because it has the ends curved up, and not just the sides. This is also sometimes refered to as a ""4-sided changing pad"" since all 4 edges are raised.It seems very sturdy and fits very well on top of my dresser, effectively converting the dresser to a changing table. The only reason I didn't rate this higher was that it didn't include a non-skid pad on the bottom of the pad. Also, it would have been nice if it included a sheet or cover.Next, I need to order some covers for it, since the baby doesn't like being directly against the smooth plastic surface. I am not sure which covers to order."
2,Not a standard size,"The pad itself seems nice and the hardware to securely fasten it to the furniture is great. However, it's size is 33x17 - standard covers are 32x16 - also, the belt laps connects in the middle where the 'standard' is on the outside - therefore, using standard covers won't work and you'll have to buy the rumble tuff proprietary covers which there are very few selections."
4,"Okay For The Price, Could Do Better","First off, this is a halfway decent product for the price, although I prefer the contoured ones.To address the strap issue: I find strapping the baby in unecessary, as you should never even turn your back on your child while they are being changed. If you never turn your back and you have one hand on the child at all times, why would you even consider using the strap? Secondly, I'm moving a bit too fast to worry about strapping my child in. Changing diapers is about speed...for me, at least."
1,Flushing your money away!,"Leaked from two places on first use - Around the latch from the upper water reservoir and around rubber seals. Unfortunately warranty expired. Terrible product, don't buy."
1,Noy happy with this toilet.,This is the worst portable toilet I have ever owned. It has a problem with leaking and the flush handle pulls very hard. I have to keep a towel under the toilet at all times because I never know when it is going to leak on my floor in my Man Cave. Would not recommend this toilet to anyone. I very sorry I ever purchased it. I have to keep it because I cannot afford to buy another one. I have sent the company Century Camping a email and I'm waiting to see what they do to correct this problem. Will change my review if they do something about my complaint.
2,water tank has sprung leaks,"I have owned this model for 1 year. I have used it on 2 separate week long trips in my RV. Initially, I was very pleased with the design, it is sanitary and easy to clean, it does not get smelly. However, I just pulled it out to use for the third time and the water tank has sprung 2 leaks right where the latches on either side attach. I am going to try patching it with caulk, but I feel this product should have had considerably more life in it."
1,"Not worth the price, leaks !!!","I purchased this Portable Toilet in July 2010 for use in Sept.2010 when we traveled. It is for emergency only and used very little. In May of 2011 when we were on the road again, we noticed wetness around the portable toilet, thinking we had spilled water when filling it, we used it. This portable toilet is in our van, on carpet, not out in the elements. When we added the sanitizer liquid which is blue in color did we see the large stain. The Carpet ruined. It took some time to find the leak, two 1 inch cracks on the bottom tank in a ""most unlikely area"". When holding the tank to the light it is very visible and one can see the lousy workmanship of the cheap plastic molding, thin on one side, thicker on the other. Of course this Portable toilet was made in China. For $ 93.89 dollars it is not worth it and cost us even more due to the damage to the rug. To bad it took us 3 trips to figure out where the leak was coming from."
1,Why old folks should retire,Just sad listening to an old lady trying ot reach the notes. She has plenty of older Cd's from her prime. Don't waste your money.
5,It's rare to find a singer in the 90's with sincerety...,Miss Peggy Lee sings 14 superior standards in that misty Lee style including a fever influenced Why Don't you Do Right and a hauntingly gorgious The Folks Whoi Live On The Hill. One of the last legendary singers still alive and performing(the other is Anita O'Day)
2,"Peggy Lee, not at her best","If I'm not mistaken, this was Miss Lee's final recording. Unfortunately, her performance is not memorable and the sound quality of the disc is terrible. Anyone curious about Miss Lee's latter day releases would do better with any of the following:'Mirrors' (1975, 3.5 stars)'Love Held Lightly' (recorded 1988, 3.5 stars)'Miss Peggy Lee Sings The Blues' (1988, 3 stars)'There'll Be Another Spring' (1990, 3.5 stars)All are out-of-print at this time, but look for used copies or wait for the inevitable(?) reissues. You won't be sorry."
2,"Helpful to Identify Patterns, but overall, a Disappointment","While this book was helpful in pointing out self-defeating patterns, it did little to help the reader see beyond these patterns. A summary of this book in one sentence: ""Reader, it's all your fault."" To be fair, I didn't finish this book, but I did read a great deal of it. I appreciate the Christian perspective. However, I didn't find the book very helpful."
1,Very Disappointing,"I read alot of self help books and look for ways to improve my life. I found this book to be condemning and depressing. It was like one million and one ways to put yourself down and why you are such a bad, bad person. I don't mind taking responsibilty for my actions and acting to change the things I do wrong. I believe that one should try to build character and not go for quick fixes, but I didn't find this book at all helpful. A real disappointment."
2,Very Disappointing....NOT helpful in the least.,"I was unaware when I purchased this book that there would be a religious slant on it. There is no indication that religion would be a part of it when I ordered it. I found this book to be incredibly judgmental, specifically when in one chapter the author mentions a woman using a vibrator as not a ""proper"" thing to do. Also the author does not have a PhD, and therefore in my opinion has no basis for writing a book that is supposed to help with addiction.Very disappointing."
2,Not strong enough,It’s not strong enough to properly support the large Elinchrom Octo soft box. I sent it back and bought a circular adaptor.
3,OK,Has lake contours for most lakes but not all of them. Displays some boat ramps but are missing quiet a few. Didn't disappoint me to bad nor did it please me that much.
1,Bare Basics,"As a history teacher I find this book extremely juvenile and geared to the reading skills of a twelve year old. The history is there, but only superficially. If someone is looking for a quick read on Hitler and does not want to get to involved with facts and a variety of other information concerning history, then this book is for you.A. M. Schlesinger, Jr. provides a somewhat interesting introduction to this book concerning leadership. However, his name and reputation do absolutely nothing to enhance this book. My advice, check the ""ole' ENCYCLOPEDIA for it will do as good a job explaining Hitler as this book and it is a whole lot CHEAPER."
2,"Hitler-Leader, but thankfully not of the world.","In response to the above statement. Hitler did commit genocide, but he was a leader. He led Germany. Leaders aren't necessarily good people who do good things."
5,Delicious!,"You will hate Mapp. You will hate Lucia. BUT you will love the book: it's deliciously witchy (with a capital ""B"")."
4,uk ear rings,"JUST THE RIGHT SIZE. NICE QUALITY AND VERY ATTRACTIVE STYLE. OF COURSE,DEPICTING THE OUTSTANDING UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY WILDCATS IS ALWAYS A WINNER !"
2,Just OK,"Honestly not a great book to take with you on the trip. It is a good primer before you go-what to see, but you still need another book for your travels.There are no maps in this book-so it is difficult to plan out your travels-and you may be right near another shopping possiblity and not even know it.I did buy this book and Eye Witness Top 10 Travel Guide to London and found after a day or two this was the only book I left for the day with-it has all of the same information, plus maps of the city. Also a smaller book that fits in a back pocket."
5,CAN'T WAIT!!,"I just ordered this book, and these girls really know their stuffL!!! I'm excited to travel London with the advice of girls who have been there and done that!!"
4,You Go Girl London: A Travel Guide Just for the Girls,"A great book, particularly if you're wanting to travel London on a budget. I found the suggestions of movies to see and books to read before travelling there to be insightful, (something other travel guides don't seem to touch.)"
2,description/edition information lacking,The item had very little description with no edition information. It ended up just being an older addition of a book I already had.
1,Smoke came out of my phone and could smell it burning from the next room. Reverse polarity. Terrible quality control.,"I read all the reviews and decided this would be the right battery, but when I plugged it in, it started smelling and later smoke started coming out. I had to pull the battery out and checked with a multi-meter. I was able to figure out that the polarity was reversed, all the way from the battery terminals. The wires and the clip were correctly installed but the terminals are reversed. I ended up pulling the tiny clip tabs out and interchanged the wires. It works fine now.Needs better quality control by the manufacturer."
3,Did not fit my Uniden phones,The Batttery is probably OK. The Description leaves something to be desired. Can'y say more because I did not use the battery.
4,exact fit,"this battery was an exact fit in our old panasonic cordless phone. a couple years ago the original battery went out and we got a replacement enercell from radio shack. original panasonic lasted 10 yrs. enercell 2 yrs. enercell was also expensive at the shack. the lenmar somewhat less after including shipping. original battery rated at 600 mah, enercell at 700 mah and this lenmar is 1200 mah. arrived charged and has been working flawlessly now for a couple weeks. if this lenmar lasts 10 years i'll change my review to 5 stars."
1,Battery destroyed phone.,"The title is simply put in the headline. I bought this battery to replace a dead Uniden BT905 battery. Installed the battery just fine and came back to it a few hours later, smelling ""hot"" like burnt plastic and electronics. Phone was no longer functional. I would strongly recommend a different choice, probably best just to go to your phone manufacturer's website and get a battery from them directly."
1,Sucking my will to live,"This book is painful to read.The heroine is one dimensional and difficult to empathize with in her constant baseless and ludicrous fights over nothing.And in all my life, living around America, I've never heard anyone speak like she does. The colloquialisms intended to lend flavor and accent to the country western character were cartoon-like and unbelievable. It's as though the author created her heroine after watching Doris Day's portrayal of Calamity Jane, not realizing it was intended to be an amusing caricature for a 1950s audience.Yosemite Sam in a dress would have seemed more authentic as a contemporary American woman.Come to think of it, the author *did* describe how short the character was. Sufferin succotash! It *was* Yosemite Sam!"
5,hilarious!!,"The best part of this DVD is that our entire family finds it hilarious- our 11 and 14 year olds find it as funny as we do, and it is not inappropriate humor....funny yet family friendly, at least for bigger kids. We got both of his DVDs and laugh our heads off at both! Enjoy!!"
5,BEST COMEDY I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME,"This is the funniest comedy I have seen lately. I have watched it twice now and laughed as hard the second time. His clean comedy is so refreshing and I love his alter ego voice, so great. Anyone in the family can watch and the whole family can watch together, a rare find. A must see."
4,"not his best, but not bad","He's funny, but I don't think this is his funniest. The ""Beyond the Pale"" was hilarious so I had really high expectations for this one. Overall, he's still funny and I would buy it again. Very high expectations will almost always let you down, so if you go in with a ""it's alright"" attitude, then you should really enjoy it! ..and I DO love bacon!"
3,Paid $9.99,"I didn't think it was worth $9.99. I got it on Amazon Instant Video. His other standup, Mr. Universe, is SO much funnier. I watch that one repeatedly. This one wasn't as good."
2,ok but not best,"Jim did ok on this one, not nearly as funny as his other stuff, so it was kind of a downer"
2,what a disappointment!,"After seeing Beyond the Pale, which was incredibly hilarious, I just had to have King Baby.... well, I was totally disappointed. Gaffigan isn't funny anymore. The only funny piece on King Baby is the Waffle House bit, which you can see for free on youtube. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,TEN DOLLAR COASTERS...,"Low IQ??? You'll absolutely LOVE these Jim Gaffigan DVDs. What scares me is that after I die someone will find these two DVDs among my possessions and think I liked this kind of low-brow humor (I bought them both based on the reviews...BAD decision). All these 4 and 5 star reviews makes me ashamed to be an American. You are the people who run our businesses and sit on juries. And you find this guy hilarious??? This guy is about as intellectually stimulating as a box of turnips. Give me George Carlin, Dennis Miller or Steven Wright anytime. I plan to use these Jim Gaffigan DVDs as coasters, face side down."
3,Let's get real,"Bruce Dunlap is a fine guitar player. However, his style is sodissimilar to either Christian, Reinhardt, or Farlow that anycomparison is meaningless. Dunlap more skilled than Django?Gimme a break!"
1,Where are the citations?,Bruhn fails to cite his sources on many occasions. He bends data to fit his contention that community is the main solution to social problems. While Community is important it is not the only answer. He is conservative in his views and his comments on the poor made me wince.His version of American Community is colored by some Leave it to Beaver fantasy world that has long past if it ever existed at all. What Bruhn does not know is apparent and could do considerable damage to novice readers.Dont buy this book.
2,Good but Westerncentric,This book offers the westernized academic perspective when discussing community formation. That is problematic when one's work is outside of those realms. I have to deeply interrogate the conceptual themes to be able to utilize them within my own work.
1,What's going on here?,"This is no longer the Asterix we have come to known over the past few decades. This is something... weired!Instead of fighting Romans or travelling around the world, Asterix meets a bunch of aliens and... Superman clones. This is so terrible. Albert Uderzo has succesfully damaged his lifework by putting this volume of Asterix' adventures on the market.Admitably, Uderzo is not the first European comic book artist to seek a new approach to well established characters. Even Hergé did so in one of his last Tintin books, ""Vol 714 pour Sydney"", or ""Flight 714"" as it is known in the US. Yes, there was an UFO in ""Flight 714"", but that story did work -- in contrast to this one.As that golden bowl decends to Asterix' village, a threat even scarier than Cesar's legions looms over the gaul's world: unimaginative storytelling, boredom and idiocy..."
5,"The nastyman does it again, with a final note ?","Quality as always, Aaron Hall sets the trend. Every artist who evolved from the ""New Jack:"" or ""Swingbeat"" era has proved to be innovative and staying loyal to tradition as being the key to success. Aaron Hall; with his unique voice still is one of the founders of this very futuristic era and deserves the respect given. The best way to understand the album is to comprehend the title: Adults Only. While you listen to the tracks keep this in mind and try to imagine the artist's and listener's growth over the years. A truly unique voice and a powerfull show of vocal force & blessings ! Absolutely extraordinary ! a must have BUY THIS CD !"
3,4 stars for the voice 1 for the production,"Aaron Hall is clearly one of the most underrated vocalists of the nineties. I remeber the first time I heard Aaron blow on the classic slow jams Let's Chill, Yearning For Your Love, Piece Of My Love and of course I Miss You. Aaron still has a very strong and capable voice but unfourtanely subpar production hurt this album. I can't think of any standout tracks on the album and one of the worst is the cover of Tears In Heaven. Here's hoping his next album will boast better production and he can become the singer he was destined to be."
5,aaron hall lovers this is for us!!!,"i just recieved my copy of adults only and i cannot express the greatness of this man's voice as a fan since groove me i have followed aaron's career through every soundtrack, duet, cameo appearance and solo albums and never can i say he disappointed me as i listen to this album it is hard for me not to wonder where the promotion was for this classic! if you love or even like aaron hall dont even hesitate buy this the whole album is cold but the trinity numbers 8,9 and 10! they go hardbody! aaron is sexy and forceful, its been six years since this release and i know i speak for all aaron hall fans when i say we want more!"
1,Flow and Transition,"My big problem with this film is that it simply does not flow. It's like a composition that meanders all over the place and does not fully explore any thesis. Characters do things which one simply wouldn't do in real life. If I was a graduate student at Oxford, I surely wouldn't drop the ""F"" bomb on a Don whom I want to become my mentor. Romantic relationships appear ""out of the blue."" Some characters disappear into thin air and the plot is so disjointed that I felt the whole thing was a waste of time. It's a pity because the trailer looked good and Lenora Watling is certainly easy to look at, but Elijah Wood is just plain HORRIBLE and quite frankly, other than her looks, Ms. Watling doesn't impress much either. Hurt spends his time pontificating and the whole thing is a jumble. Don't bother with it."
1,a novel ...,"... that shouldn't have been adapted for film. i haven't read the book, but it's obvious. it's disjointed. the script is awful. the actors are good (John Hurt is still the best), but the film is not."
1,Self Indulgent,"Have you ever known someone that thought they were just the cleverest mind in the circle - that had that self indulgent, narcissistic belief that they and they alone could create or solve the most convoluted brain teasers. OK, well maybe some of those attributes. Well, this movie was the film incarnation of that person. Just a predictable boring studio's pointless production of contrivance."
2,if it wasn't for frodo,"The concept behind this movie, the true adventure of the plot lies in the mathematics. John Hurt was amazing as usual, as well as the beautiful Leanor Watling. However, the relationships and their interactions were awful.Reasons being? Well for one, they all contained Elija Wood who is just the worst actor imaginable. He did much better when he didn't speak in the movie than anything else. He lacked emotion as well as the determination his character should have displayed. Even more, Julie Cox (Beth's Character) was just as bad. How is it that the most important characters in the movie were the worst actors ever known.A remake of this movie would be much nicer, maybe replace Wood with Shia Lebouf (if you cant get anyone better.)"
1,Bad Bad Bad,Elijah Wood is repugnant in the sex scenes. He should stick to playing elfs. The script and plot are boring and badly executed. There are some fine actors stuck in this awful mess. Don't waste your time.
2,Eh.,"The story line was interesting - however, the movie was slow and painful, in my humble opinion.The acting was good, but the overall movie not holding me. I enjoyed the last 30 minutes the most."
2,HOLLOW WOOD,"THE OXFORD MURDERS is typical British cinema--cerebral, pondering and tedious. While BBC's WAKING THE DEAD is excellent, this movie doesn't compare on any level.An interesting mystery is shrouded with mathematical mumbo jumbo which rises above the average viewer's knowledge or interest (like TV's NUMB3RS).LOTR's Elijah Wood uses his soulful eyes and little else in his wooden performance; John Hurt is excellent as always, and Julie Cox chews up the scenery.The movie's twist ending is surprising but gets anti-climactic execution.Primarily, it's just all rather boring."
2,absurdly pretentious shaggy dog story!,"This is not even correct in its facts about the math/logic background. It is over-the-top and stupid, and depressing to boot."
2,Murderd movie,"In a word - underwhelmed. The film had potential and failed to deliver in the writing, directing, and most disappointing the acting. Wood demonstrated a bit of growth in ""Green Street Hooligans"" and I was looking forward to seeing if he could demonstrate some true dramatic chops. His performance felt flat, forced, and meandering. Hurt's performance was perfunctory at best and felt as if he just dusted off elements of ""Douglas Benoit"" with far less skill or passion. Watling and Cox characters were predictable and cliché. All the potential for character arc and story just failed to make it to the screen. Even the Oxbridge canvas failed to hold interest. Skip this one."
3,A thinking mans murder mystery,"I found this film engaging on many levels. While sticking to genre format it explores the the themes of truth, certainty causality, randomness, and coincidence and mystery texts in general in a very entertaining way. Well acted and well directed with a mix of close ups of very arresting faces of bizzare and compulsive characters a great tracking sequence, wholesome funny sex scenes, overhead shots, flashbacks and voice overs,integrated subplots, and an unanticipated satisfying ending."
5,Interesting movie,"Full of intrigue,Required some thought and had some surprises throughout the movie, acting was very good and very enjoyable would recommend it"
3,One size does NOT fit all.,"I ordered this because it said one size fits all. Even on the package, the word ""all"" is emphasized. However, it does not fit the 6qt Mixers. This would be great if you have a 5qt or smaller mixer."
2,This is too bulky for my mixer,I HAVE THE ARTISAN KITCHENAID MIXER AND THIS COVER IS TOO BULKY FOR IT. IT IS TOO LONG AT THE BOTTOM AND JUST UNPLEASING TO THE EYE. WOULD RECOMMEND JUST LEAVING YOUR MIXER UNCOVERED. HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL.
4,A Great Book For Learning More About Street Fighter,"I'm starting to think that Capcom just pulls Mega Man and Street Fighter games out of nowhere whenever they get bored and run out of original ideas. I bought the guide to this game so that I could keep up to date with the Street Fighter series. Well, there were other reasons too... Anyway, this turned out to be a great book, and it fully explains the whole confusing X-ism, Y-ism, A-ism thing. Plus, it gives a lot of information about the characters' backgrounds. I had to dock the book one star because--since it gives full move lists and paragraph-long biographies for 32 characters--it cut back on a lot of things that the past Alpha Official Strategy Guides had. Examples include endings and damage percentages for each attack."
3,"Fast Keyboard, Sluggish Mouse","The Package:- Setup was easy. I use a KVM switch, which was one of the reasons I liked this package, because of it's support for PS/2 connections.The Keyboard:- Performance was excellent. There was never a delay, and the shortcut buttons were a nice convenience.- The layout is awkward with regards to the Home|Delete|End|PageUp|PageDown keys. Microsoft apparently wanted to reduce the width of the keyboard, but I would have prefered the standard layout.The Mouse:- Performance was choppy. At times the mouse pointer would ""stutter"", and other times it would fly across the screen just fine. This is annoying. I tried different batteries (the problem started within minutes of use with the batteries included in the box), different mouse pads, and making sure that there was a clear line of sight to the receiver (only 3 feet away).I give this product 3 stars for a good performing keyboard but a sub-par mouse..."
2,sub par,"I was disappointed with my purchase...several things made this set a less than perfect product. My main problem is the mouse; not only does it eat through batteries- it never shuts off, so I pull the batteries out at night- but it also has shoddy drivers- the mouse will freeze up occasionally, and if you don't move it constantly, it will left click and move down diagonally the next time you move it. THe keyboard is fine, except the delete key and the F-lock system. Because I already know the Word shortcuts, the F-lock system is just redundant, and actually get in the way because it forces you to relearn the key. If F-lock is on, Spell-check is F-10 instead of F-7. This is unnecessary IMO. The different setup for the delete/home/end/pgup/pgdn might be more efficient, but I still have problems with it. Overall, I wish I'd gone the Logitech route."
3,Non-standard key layout,"Maybe all MS keyboards have the strange layout with the double sized delete key and the insert key up higher, but I'm still struggling to get used to it. I prefer the 6 key layout for the home, page up/dn, end, delete insert between the letters and numeric keypad. I don't like the fact the function keys are off by default. The cordless works very nicely, they keyboard has a nice feel. I just can't get used to the key layouts."
1,Bad reception.,"I received this as a gift. I am happy I haven't spent any money on this one. It has a sleek design and it works fine if you are within 1 feet to your computer. If you want to get a little far, it becomes useless.What is the point of having it wireless if you have to stay next to your computer.Really bad reception. I am trying to watch a movie couple feet away from my computer and I cannot use the keyboard or mouse to control. I tried everything. I took the communication part as close as I could, still I had to bring the keyboard almost next to it. I used brand new batteries hoping that was the problem, but unfortunately it was the useless microsoft product."
4,Great backpack for the money,"I have owned this bag for about three years, and have put a lot of miles on it. I like the unique adjustable lumbar support and it is very comfortable even with a heavy load. It has plenty of space for all my stuff and fits my IBM T61 just fine, including the power supply. The only downside has been the construction, mainly the material fraying and coming apart. I had the first bag replaced under warranty, no questions asked and it was shipped promptly. I just put in for another replacement as my second bag is now starting to do the same thing, although it lasted longer than the first one. The first bag frayed on the inside, the second is fraying on the shoulder straps. Kensignton was very responsive on the first replacement, I hope they will do the same on the second! An excellent bag otherwise, very good value for investment."
4,"Great bag, but check the zippers","I love this bag, it is just the right size for fitting my laptop and everything I need, without allowing me to overpack and have it weigh a ton. The only issue I have had with this bag, is that the zipper handles, are secured by an open loop hook. This hook is a little loose, and I lost a few on the handles. Once I figured it out, I just used a pair of pliers and clamped down on the hook so they couldn't fall out.Other than that the bag is great, just clamp those hooks down when you get it."
2,Fabric not strong enough,"Backpack has good capacity, however just after 3 months of use the fabric started to tear off from shoulders."
2,"Good bag, but poorly made",I really liked this bag - so much in fact that when my first one broke after about a year (zipper failure) I bought a second one.After the second bag failed in six months (fabric failure where the zipper attaches) I've unfortunately come to the conclusion that the bag is just not well-enough build for regular use.
5,Expoobident product,"Very well designed & made, many details -- a thoroughly excellent product and great value."
2,Falsification,"This backpack did not help out my lower back pain like it claimed to do. In addition, I would not hold it against amazon because they did fulfill the order in a timely manner. I just would not recommend it for other customers."
4,"Nice backpack, I got a lemon","I was glad to find a notebook backpack that doesn't make it look like I am going camping. It fits my Dell Inspiron 9300 (17"" Widescreen) snugly and has space for my college books.Unfortunately after a week the stitching along the inside that connected the laptop compartment began to come out.Fortunately there is a lifetime warranty and Kensington is going to replace it, but they are currently on back order from Kensington until September. It will be alright until my replacement comes."
1,Poorly made,"Within 8 months the inside lining was in tatters, the computer pocket was ripped on one side and the seams on the outside were splitting.Don't waste your money on this bag."
4,"Doesn't quite fit all 15.4"" widescreens","It looks like a great backpack. The pockets in the second zippered area are awesome because you can fit your power supply, mouse, cables, mp3 player, etc easily and be very organized. If my laptop (a Lenovo T60P) actually fit inside the laptop sleeve, I would love the backpack because I am a big fan of organization and pockets for basically everything. However, my laptop didn't fit, so if you have a 15.4"" widescreen, be wary of the fact that it will be a tight squeeze or it might not fit at all. I gave this backpack away to someone else, so I can't really comment on the durability."
1,I'm sorry I read this (really),"I had some anticipation that Zindell would carry over the originality he showed in his four NEVERNESS titles to this one.I read all of it, and began hating it after about page 50. It collects all the trite elements of several series and popular novels and adds nothing orignal to the story that would make it it's own story.It is void of orignality. It is a collection of fantasy novel cliche's, and they all irritate. It would have been different if this book was a parody.Volume one of a series? I won't buy them, or read them.A huge disapointment."
1,Color of numbers,The colors of the numbers are too dim. The yellows and oranges are too dim- very difficult to see. Need brighter colors.
4,We love Puremco Number Dominoes Prem. Double 12 Set!!,"We are SO glad that we recently ordered this product. I doubt that we'll ever play with standard pip dominoes again. My husband & I play dominoes frequently with 1-2 other couples ranging in age from mid-forties to mid-sixties; we all agree that this set is much easier to read. There is no straining to overcome light reflection to tell what colors the dominoes are or having difficulty counting the pips at a distance. Yes, Puremco's choice of colors for the 6 & 9 could have been better but the line under the 6 suffices once we got used to it. Yes, the 4 & 7 have somewhat similar shades of yellow. These issues are easily overcome, however, by being able to read the numbers at a distance. We feel these negatives are easily overcome."
5,Numbers Are Great,"I was first introduced to Mexican Train in 2004. I was still pretty bright eyed and bushy tailed at that point. Since then I have had multiple surgeries, three of them on my eyes. Various other surgeries have just left me older and stiffer than I used to be.SO!!! It is nice to play Mexican Train with the Numbers spelled out instead of trying to count dots from across the table, or trying to sit up a bit to lean in closer to see better. It is a great thing for those of us who are not so spry as we used to be, but still like to take time out for ""dominos."" We certainly aspire to keeping that picture of the elderly whiling away their Senior Days while playing chess or dominos in the park intact. (Tongue in cheek...as seen on TV!)Truly, it is easier to read and tell what the dominos say for anyone who is not in the ""20-20"" categtory and I am grateful to those who put the numbers to plastic!"
5,4thefam,As my husband and I age the dots on the regular dominoes are very hard to keep track of when we have a lot to count up. Love the numbers on this and even our kids and guest love the numbers. We have enjoyed many nights of playing chicken foot and it is a great game to play after dinner. Also love the case and will be easy to take on trips. Great price and loads of fun
4,Love the Big Numbers,"Love the big numerals. It is money well spent. Yes, the color of numerals 9 and 6 are not distinctive enough but the 6's have a dash like this ""_"" so it is not that bad."
4,hours of fun,A fun game that is easy to learn and hours of fun. There are a number of variations of this game so you never get bored. Our grandson who is 5 played with the rest of the family for hours.
2,Puremco Number dominoes Double 12,"We play lots of games with friends Mexican Train is the game we have been playing. The color of the tilesweren't thought out very well, they are not vibrant colors like some i have seen, also or example the 6 andthe 9 are very close in color not good for this game. We will continue to use the dominoes and enjoy the game"
4,dominoes,"I purchased these dominoes for a senior retirement home because they prefer the numbers over the dots on the tiles, easier to read. The only complaint is that some of the numbers are too faint of a color and still a little difficult to read. Otherwise it is a nice set."
2,Colors on the 6 and 9 too similiar,The colors used on numbers 6 and 9 appear almost identical this makes it difficult to distinguish which tile needs to be played. Also the blank tile in this set is nmber 0 which is not the conventional marking on other sets that we are used too. The blank issue is not as bad as the color issue.
4,number dominoes,Great and fun game for the whole family. Really like the big numbers that are on the tiles. Only complaint is that the 4 and 7's and the 6 and 9's are so similar in color. Couldn't they find two other colors to put on them.
2,Author tries too hard to show his knowlege of Kabbalah,"Behrens should really write more for the reader and not for himself. He goes way over the top with obsure Hebrew words, which leaves the reader feeling like an outcast from the very begining .It's almost like he is trying to show off. I am a Rabbi of the Kabbalah and have taught many students on the subject. I'm sorry to say,I would not recomend this book to any of my students or friends."
1,Get this man to a Doctor!,"There are so many people in this world who cannot get along with living a ""regular"" life. They will create themselves or remake if you will, themselves into something different. OOOhhh, very mystical! The problem is of course that they are always full of malarky! This book starts in the guise of a novel but then shifts into a platform in which the so called author starts to make his mystical claims. He even tries to sell us a magic lucky charm! Bright stars!, green clovers! Oh My! without knowing this man I can tell you a few things about him, First he is under 5'4"". he is Probably missing some teeth and I bet he dyes his hair. They all are just the same. As you can guess, I didn't like this book."
1,Waste of Money!,"I love books on the occult and religion.But once again Ive been duped into buying another book that seems to have been written by a ego-maniac.The meditation instructions in the back of the book was an insult to all those who meditate. The Kabbhlah is a beautiful, rich, rewarding sect of Judisim which should not be written about buy someone who is just trying to sell a ""magic medallion"". Shame on the author."
1,Shame on the author,"What a disgrace to the Jewish faith. What a dishonor to the great history and tradition of the Kahbblah. Myself and my family were greatly offened by this ego driven crap. The sections on meditation is for fools. Fiction is one thing but messing with God is another. I am ashamed that Amazon.com would carry such a book. I am a Jew, so I have the right to speak the truth about such an alwful book."
3,Novel in service of a message,"While this novel is adequately written, it is not enhanced by extremely gifted writing or an intriguing plot line. The adventure is somewhat predictable, the romance even more predictable, and the spiritual insights derivative of New Age sensibilities put forth as teaching devices through the mouths of several of the characters. Although the descriptions of hell and heaven are at times interesting, if I had it to do over, I would skip the story and head straight for the appendix where there is a summary of the spiritual exercises mentioned in the novel. They alone are probably the most valuable part of this book."
1,Boring Story,Very boring story. Badly written. Poor subject matter. Author should go and take a course on basic writting at a local College.
3,Takes Some Getting Used To,"I'm a novice, so maybe it's just me but it was difficult at first to figure out the apperature settings for light adjustments. Images were a bit rough, but it served it's purpose for the price."
2,Preset Lens for Sony Alpha,"Well made, but optically flawed. Critical focus is difficult, at best (manual focus camera setting). I have an old 350 mm preset that runs circles around this lens for sharpness. Have a very good tripod, have used beanbags - generally impossible to get an acceptably sharp result."
4,Sony A57 WORKS GREAT!,"Own Sony A57, the lense works real well with the camera. Played with it for about 2 hours. Very satisfied!"
2,Good - but Not all Code Works,"I purchased this book more for the quick and dirty SQL applications than for the detailed 'How-To'. Unfortunately some code examples were created with a very early version of Visual Studio.NET. The code is now obsolete, so you must spend a fair amount of time repairing the code and bringing it up to the latest VisualStudio.NET conventions. Even then you might not get it working. I wish the publisher would make code corrections and errata available on their web site, but they do not."
3,The Specter in America,Leffler writes a balanced account of the events leading up to and into the the Cold War. He discusses the impact of geopolictics with regard to the First and Second World Wars and how communism impacted American public policy. He points out that it was not so much fear of the physical power of the Soviet Union but fear of the ideologies of communism within our borders that led the anit-communist anti-Soviet movements in our nation. He follows the growth of Russia into a world power and explains how it eventually became a military threat and a nuclear power. The book is engrossing and well structured. Leffler presents the information in a clear way without unnecessary deviations. It is an excellent look at Cold War origins.
1,The book did not cover anything that was on the actual test.,"This was the worst test preparation booklet I ever used. The booklet included extremely technical terminology and questions. The test was straightforward and contained mostly common sense questions. There may have been one question from the booklet on the test. The questions and answers included in this booklet in no way resembled those asked on the test. Luckily, I decided to go to my college and there I studied from a guide that was completely aligned to the actual Dantes Here's To Your Health exam. I do not recommend this book for test preparation."
1,Not accurate to Test as of August 2006,"I took this test August of 2006, and studied this book for a few hours. This book is basically a huge list of sample Q's and A's (hopefully their answers are correct!)I went through about 2/3 of the book, and I was pretty worried because the questions weren't about ""health"", they were about getting your M.D.For instance, ""What Vitamin will help protect your children from rickets?"" or ""Cortisone is used to relieve the symptoms of..."" or ""A deficiency of niacin usually results in...""LOTS of detailed questions about causes and symptoms of diseases, specific chemical processes, etc.The test was MUCH easier than this book seemed to suggest.I was only helped on the test by about 10 questions from this book - that's 10%...Get a general health book instead for studying - Much more general..."
4,Here's To Your Health,"This study guide covers a vast amount of information. However, additional resources are needed along with the study guide. Practice test help define weak area so that studying in more productive."
1,Here's to your Health,"This book did not help me one bit for the exam, the only thing I learned from this book was how to be more careful when purchasing things like this!"
1,Here's to your health,"I don't recommend this book at all, I found out later that this books is NOT endorsed by DSST."
3,Here's To Your health,Sample Test are good problem is there are around 50 sample test. Some questions were on the actual Dante's exam. Need plenty of time to review exams
1,"Unfortunately, these series of DANTES test prep books are all outdated","Unfortuntately, these series of DANTES test prep books from National Learning are all outdated and of marginal use in preparing for the exams."
4,Fun Dates,"I really enjoyed reading this book as I am a romantic at heart and love to constantly try new things. The book is a bit on the smallish side but some good nuggets here.I'd also recommend 300 Creative Dates that I found at the site 300creativedates. com -- a bit more but at 6 times the dates, well worth it."
1,Disappointing and unsubstantial,"I was very disappointed. I was looking for novel ideas for romantic dates to revive my marriage, but found the suggestions either predictable, impractical, or just stupid (a trip to Home Depot is considered a date?!). This book doesn't cost much, but you don't get much either."
3,for my son,My son and I enjoyed watching the dvd. The story line is easy to follow and artisty is very good. It completed the set of 3 dvds of the blue dragon.
5,Awesome Portable BBQ Grill Design,"We camp and grill out often, and over the years we've used up, burnt up, and destroyed many a so called portable grill. The Cobb Grill is proving to be the best design we've tried for portability, function and just plain good looks. It fits perfectly in it's very handy carrying case. It's shape makes it easy to pack in with all our camping gear. It can cook a meal for four people on a hand full of coal in no time at all. And the darn thing looks good. Did I mention it's a breeze to keep clean with it's no stick grill and stainless steel base. No problem emptying the coals when you done either, because the outside is covered with some space age plastic. It insulates and keeps the all the heat inside the body of the grill. This thing ought to be in the modern museum of art! In this grill functionality and form come together in a brilliantly executed design. If you like to grill the Cobb is a thrill!"
5,An Inspirational Gold Mine,"""Maxims of Life & Business"" by John Wanamaker is an uplifting composite of his life and business philosophy, and is filled with many valuable and inspiration aphorisms to help maximize one's life and supervisory experience. A virtual treasure trove of original thoughts to motivate others ""to be all that they can be,"" and a source for dozens of chin-lifting wall plagues and posters."
5,Green Coffee Bean Capsules,I have been using this product for several months and my HDL has been much improved sinse I have been using it.
3,The Extras Make the Difference!,I have several commentaries. The thing that makes this one stand out is the maps and the outline of each book.
3,Dont use Software on Laptop,Dont use the software provided with this keyboard on your laptop i have found that it makes it so that all your FN keys do not work.So preety much its just a regular keyboard since the hotkeys dont work without the software.
1,"By The Way, It's Discontinued......",Microsoft no longer makes the Office Keyboard. Now you know why these are inexpensive.
4,Love & hate relationship...,"I love the clipboard keys (cut, copy,& paste keys.) Use them all the time. My problem is that the right side shift key started to ""stick"" about a year after I bought it. Anyone else out there had the same problem?Unusual positioning of home, delete, end, page up, & page down keys, but you will get used to them as long as you don't use another keyboards elsewhere. The placement of ""insert"" key is interesting. (It is above your number keys.) Keyboard is large. So check your space before you buy it."
4,"I LOVE THIS KEYBOARD, AND I USE IT AT WORK AND AT HOME","Key features:SCROLL WHEEL: Once you start using the scroll wheel (on the left side) you won't be able to work without it! It releaves alot of stress on the mouse hand for sure. My car-pool tunnel doesn't bother me anymore.FORWARD/BACK KEYS: Browsing the internet is much easier with these keys. No more hunting for the back arrow with the mouse. Anytime I can do something without the mouse I like it.OFFICE SHORTCUTS: Honestly, the one I use the most is Mail. I have the Mail key reprogrammed to create a new mail message. So I don't have to find the email program, then click new mail message. One button access to new email!COMPLAINTS: My one complaint is the way they arranged the key group above the arrow keys (home, page up, page down, delate). This is a non-standard way to arrange the keys so it take a bit of getting used to. But now I have one at home and at work so I don't have to switch back and forth."
5,Go great I wore it out (took a couple years),"Why in the name of God has Microsoft discontinued this thing? It's awesome!If you spend 20 or more hours a week looking at Office Applications, especially data manipulation, this is the keyboard for you."
4,Minolta NP-200 Battery,"I have no problem with it so far. It allows me to take many pictures and carry it around for days before recharging. With it, my old camera is working like new again. I can wait awhile before I shop for a new camera. Overall, I am satisfy with it."
1,Highlights from Yes Friends & Family,"Another unanotherised release. This one features stuff from recent yes albums plus tracks from Conspiracy, Howe, and Anderson - virtually all of this (except the songs from Magnification) recycled from the 2-disc Yes Friends & Relatives 2"
2,John's Children - 'Orgasm' (Airmail),"Originally put out in 1970,looks to be John's Children last effort.Ten tracks of material that's pure mediocre.Upside is that die-hards should like this disc more than the 'casual' fan.Included is their hit single ""Just What You Want"" and a couple of other decent tunes are ""Cold On Me"" and ""Smashed!Blocked"".If you want a better piece of John Children's work,try the 2-CD 'The Complete' on the Pilot label.That title is much better."
5,Lenmar DLF60 Lithium-ion Battery Equivelent,"A good value for the price so i purchased two. I have not put many cycles on the batteries, but they look so far . I am very pleased..."
2,Clumsy,The Band is fine if you only want to use it for upper body but I find it quite clumsy to attach the straps every time I need to change feet when I'm working lower body. The handles are also not big enough to comfortably put your foot through. I wear a US 8 shoe and I had to struggle to put my foot through which is quite annoying when you are in the middle of exercising to waste time with the equipment.
1,Short lived!,"This exercise band seemed so useful that I ordered two. Good thing, because the first one broke before I'd even discarded the package. It is obviously made of flimsy rubber, since it (painfully!) snapped under the duress it was meant to withstand. Would not recommend.Bally Total Fitness Pilates Fitness Band"
2,"look good, but don't do anything","We bought these for the goody bags for our son's birthday party. The kids were excited when they saw them in their bags, but the excitement soon faded when they realized they are too light to throw very far. The cat likes to chew on them though!"
2,Foam,I thought that what I was purchasing was going to be durable. I thought from the looks of it (there was nothing saying what the bat-a-rang's were made of)were going to be plastic. They turned out to be foam and flimsy.
3,ok i guess,"my 5 year old son picked these out, but they don't really compare to similar products he has owned before. they're foam (as advertised), so they aren't going to fly very far.. if at all. on the other hand, they aren't hard enough to do damage to anyone or anything. for the price, they're ok i guess."
2,Reluctant Rental,"It should be noted that Shining Force Neo is not an RPG, but a real time action adventure game. There is a lot of timing and button mashing to defeat hordes of monsters over and over again. There are countless long, boring cutscene style dialogs between the characters, and a less than interesting storyline. On the plus side, the music is not bad and the graphics are acceptable. There are also special abilities thrown into the combat which make it a little more fun than if it were a pure beat 'em up such as Dynasty Warriors. However, the item system is very convoluted and frustrating to understand; it is not intuitive. If you prefer real time action adventure type games to RPG and turn based strategy games, you might want to give this game a go, otherwise I would have to recommend avoiding this one unless someone is letting you borrow it for free."
2,Bad game.,"The ONLY good thing about this game is the anime sequences, but THAT'S IT!You control the characters from top far (helicopter view) witch is VERY difficult to see them doing cool action (you can hardly see the characters), the graphics are very cheap, the characters look lame, the fighting COMBOS are very boring and repetitive (is the same attack every time), stupid magic tricks, poor voices actings and HORRIBLE production!This game is like Gauntel Legends because you fight with many enemies at the same time with different characters, different attacks and you hardly see them fighting.Anyway, don't buy this garbage unless you only like to see Animes in videogames.P.S: I prefer to play Secret of Mana than this piece of junk!"
2,action that stinks,"This is supposed to be a good action RPG game. Unfortunately, the game is dominated with too many problems to really be any good. For one thing, the cheapness that occurs when an enemy is attacking you. You can die very easily in this game, which makes for an unentertaining experience.The storyline is fair and the graphics are decent. But the fact that the action is so incredibly hard really hurts the game. Don't bother."
2,Another die hard Shining Force Fan,"I would have to agree with the cheap tactics and annoying voice overs in the game. The whole idea of strategy is gone, you can close your eyes and hit a turbo button and most likely win. This is very similar to Shining Tears, which if people liked this game they should look into that one. Atleast they changed part of the name in shining tears so i didnt get my hope up very far."
2,They should have named this game something else...,"This game does not feels or plays like a shinning force game. Yes the original ones might been tactics based but it was the animated attack screens, the battle music, the side quest that made the series so popular. I don't like neo or new it is boring you have to read a lot and listen to the voice overs at the same time, too bad. This should have been called side quest or virtua quest (another big flop). I would not even rent it."
5,Chakra Healing Tape Soothes Frayed Nerves,"I found Sarah Shapiro's Chakra Healing audio tape to be a great antidote to the everyday stresses of life. The pace of the exercise is excellent, Ms. Shapiro's voice is pleasant and soothing and the music is well suited to her words. All in all I find it to be a very effective and professional production which I enjoy using regularly."
2,"Excellent performance, good sound but catastrophic picture","I bought these DVDs separately a couple of years ago. Now I am amazed by the high score given by the other reviewers. I have no argument with them about the excellent performances. In CD format, I would give them five stars but for god's sake how could you tolerate the bad picture full of haze and bad lighting. I watched these performances once and couldn't watch them any more."
3,Ok,"These lashes are ok. The small ones are really small. They are about 1/2 inch long. The other pair are quite long, longer than my eyelid. The glue works well."
1,Not Durable!!!!,When I ordered drum heads I was looking for something durable. The heads burst the first time he used them. Imagine how my child felt. I wouldn't recommend this brand at all.
3,A decent set of cards,"This set was satisfactory. I've been a longtime collector of MJ cards and while I like any MJ cards I get, I would have preferred some more inserts and stuff. I'm gonna check out the other options on the site and review those too for MJ card lots. I'm going to try the ""Various Brands Chicago Bulls Michael Jordan 20 Trading Card Set"" listing. One of the merchants even includes a free card album and card pages with the purchase. Good luck in your pursuit of MJ cards fellow collectors!"
4,Very good buy!!,I recently bough a lot of Michael Jordan Cards and I was surprised because the shipping time was excellent and so the product. There was no Jordan repeted... I'm very happy with it and I recommend it.
4,Excellent pre-war blues collection,"Though Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton and a few others couldn't be included here, BB&B is an otherwise excellent sort of pre-war greatest hits package of the blues. The sound, considering the existing source material, is very good too and makes a strong argument for this box being a near essential part of anyone's blues collection. Especially for the price."
3,Adequate Headset for Nokia 6030,"This headset was purchased for use on a Nokia 6030 phone, and it works relatively well. I have no major issues with it. It is a little flimsy in its physical construction, but that is to be expected given the very reasonable price."
1,VANILLA ICE BE DA KING O RAP,"I remember a few years ago when this white bread named Vanilla Ice came on to the scene, assaulting the world with his third-rate rappingtechnique, not to mention his laughable lyrics.The man made his money, and I respect that,but face the facts; he really, really stinks as arapper. His book is no better, but it is farsuperior to many of the so-called ""comedy""books I've read, by the likes of Whoopi, Drew,and Kelsey. Those stink, 'cause they try toohard to be something they're not, a stand-upact on print. Vanilla, however, makes me laughuncontrollably due to his bloated ego, his prose,and his outright lies. Now that's f*$#in' funny!This book sucks, but it's pretty funny just thesame. Rap on, Vanilla!"
5,St. Louis too.,"Nothing better than an sitting down with a hog's foot and an Uncle Mingo Album - a little funk, a little rock - its all good."
4,Hilarious just think about it.,Beautifully funny and hilarious tricks. In my mind I could just imagine how these tricks could be applied to friends family or people you don't like. Great entertainment.
1,"Poorly written, don't waste your time and money","This is the worst book I have ever read in my life. No matter how much they emphasize it is ""for entertainment purpose only"", they still should not get away with the tactless, thoughtless, and superficial revenge ideas. this is a book that I would definitely return -- it does not earn itself a place on my shelf. I wonder why it could be published in the first place. They did not even do a good job in their writings ---grammatical mistakes pop up from place to place. Not that I am terribly concern with grammar, but at least, writers are expected to write proper English."
5,MR. VINCENT suprises with its solid unpretentious moxy,"Director Robert Celestino pays homage to John Cassavetes in MR. VINCENT, with lots of emotionally charged black and white photography. And it works, in part because the characters and context are so different form much of Cassavetes' work, but also because Celestino only infuses this homage throughout his otherwise straight-ahead film.MR. VINCENT is a resonant emotional wringer of a movie, surprises with its solid unpretnetious moxy. Even though the characters are unlovable, it has the power to enthral. Will it send you out the door feeling good about life? As in reality, there are no easy answers."
5,Outstanding,"Mr Vincent is an Outstanding movie filledwith suspence as well as great performances.Robert Bruzio is clearly a rising star, thatwill be seen from for years to come. I highlyrecommend it."
4,the TEACCH approach,I found this book very helpful in understanding and appreciating the TEACCH approach. It is clearly written and easy to read and a great place to start.
5,A refined first rate product,I've been using Lab Series for years. It would be hard to come up with a better product no matter the cost.
5,Perfect for our home office,"We bought 2 of these. They work perfect for our home office. Allow the computer to sit up off the floor, very each to cable it up, and then push it back under the desk."
5,"Amazing, Stunning, Inspiring","When first released, Born Palestinian Born Black quickly became known as one of the most important books of the last 20 years. With this reissue, collected with the Gaza Suite poems, this book is even more essential."
1,"Truffle Oil? Well, at least the oil is real.","I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that ""truffle oil"" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles."" Read it and weep: [...]And if you see ""truffle oil"" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes..."
1,Wanted to see what it was,"Not having seen this before, I went for it, an if you don't like the taste of Garlic or smell of it, then I would not reconmend this to you.....I don't like the taste of it or the smell of it. The company did refund me my purchase price with out sending the product back to them. Never tasted what Traffule Oil was, I know its not for me."
1,Very misleading info from JR,"Why does JR Specialties attempt to trick young,gullible, aspiring chefs to use this cheap ARTIFICIAL oil?DO your research- truffle oil is not natural JR, so that piece of info should be included under PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.At least when people pay for the crap you are selling, they should bw aware that it's crap and not someeuropean made high-end truffle oil!"
1,"Actually and sadly, there's no such thing as real truffle oil.","I too was fooled, but apparently there is no such thing as truffle oil made with truffles. They are all made with a chemical compound. See this article from the New York Times:Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of TrufflesBy DANIEL PATTERSONPublished: May 16, 2007http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/dining/16truf.html?_r=1&ref;=dining&oref;=sloginAs the article notes, it's not possible to infuse oil with a truffles and ALL oils claiming to be made from truffles aren't. Don't feel too bad, even rather famous chefs fell for the idea. But all of this explains the ""one-dimensional flavor"" of these oils. One might argue if it tastes good then it doesn't matter. Perhaps, but that doesn't explain why the oils costs so much."
2,Not really suitable for hiking boots,"These might work ok for a dress boot application that doesn't actually involve a lot of walking, or perhaps for a ""hiking"" boot with very small eyelets but they're not really suitable for hiking boots. They are comparatively thin, 2 to 2.5mm diameter. For hiking, you'll want more substantial laces (3-3.5mm diameter) that have more body and strength and have less of a tendency to cut into the tongue of the boot and create unwanted pressure points across the top of your foot."
1,Second Wind,"cannot read this book it did not download properly. (text is faded) have called and complained, as I am dying to read this."
1,"Fit ,Price and Quality",The item which was made in Pakistan probably cost less than $5.00.It was poorly fitted and of low quality. The pocket for the mixer operating manual was stitched incorrectly and would not lay flat. The cover was also too long. Had I known in advance what I would receive I would not have purchased it. It is overpriced by at least $20.00.
5,Outstanding,Easily the best translation apart from Tagore's own (which is not really a translation but a work in English).
2,"good violinist ,as expected of baroque","telemann puts more playing on strings (unfortunately) than the solo violin , and one of the tracks had him seemingly plagiarize handel's water music ( or is it Handel?)"
3,Tracks mislabeled,"I absolutely love this CD (I bought it in the late 90s). My only complaint about the Amazon download is that the tracks are mislabeled -- the first track is ""Feel It"" but is listed on Amazon and will appear in iTunes as ""Sometimes,"" and vice versa for the second track. Also, the third track, ""All For You,"" is an acoustic version, not the original album version. If you want a more accurate listing, check the listing for the original 1996 audio CD.I definitely recommend the music, though."
2,Complicated,"Tracy York introduces too many movements at a time and does not introduce them well. Wish I hadn't wasted the money, I'm disappointed in this Shape workout video."
4,"""The Irish Famine (Discoveries)""","I found this book to be very gripping. It creates a picture of the Famine painted in words. Though a fairly small book in size; it speaks volumes, informatively and clearly of the suffering of the Irish people during this period. I have often recommended it to people asking me about information on the subject of the Famine. I give it 4-stars."
1,So untrue,"I could not believe what I read! Did not discuss that the military protected food exports out of Ireland during the famine. Mentioned Queen Victoria gave 2,000 pounds when in fact she gave 1,000. Nor does it mention that the ruler of Turkey tried to give 10,000 pounds but was advises to give less the the queen so not to embarrass her. They indian corn that was sent could not be eaten as the mills in Ireland could not grind it. no money was given to adapt the mill equipment. Turkey did send three boat loads of relief.The conditions in Liverpool was very bad with many Irish dying was not properly covered.I am totally shocked at this book. There was also famine in Scotland and not many died because they were given aid."
1,Not once does it mention Byzanine Text/Traditional Text,"This book never once mentions the existence of the Byzantine Text/Traditional Text of Textus Receptus. The author is a Christian Scientist who wrote the whole book giving us the impression there only has been Codex A and B which became the ""Critical Text""."
2,Gold connectors for what?,"Listen, this cable transmits the signal thru fiber-optics. The gold-plated -- oops, sorry, NOT gold-plated, ""satin nickel"" connectors -- have absolutely no bearing on the sound quality. You can get the same sound quality from another toslink cable for half (or less) the price.Unless you spend an inordinate amount of time behind your stereo instead of in front of it, and enjoy being reminded how much you overpaid for pretty connectors, don't bother with this."
1,Be careful what you order,"This product contains only one (1) evaporative filter - if you have a Lasko 1120 humidifier, you need 2 of these. Furthermore the one I received did NOT contain the water filter disk that was described on the box."
2,Did not smell like actual product,I wear Angel by Thierry Mugler regularly but the potency of the purchased product was not the same. The return time is not that great. I will have to send a third email for a status.
4,Nice,"I stopped one of my coworkers one day and asked her what was she wearing and she said Angel. At that moment, I knew I had to have it. However, I wasn't as satisfied with it once I put it on me. It still smelled great, just a lil different and it wasn't as captivating as my first impression of it. It's one of those perfumes you smell on other people and its great but once you get it, its not so great. Different strokes for different folks, I guess."
3,very small,I was confused about the size when I ordered tem...they are VERY small. Would not advise for a toddler. I returned them because of the size. Seem to be well made though.
2,Disappointing,"I am crazy about medieval romance and have read lots of them. So I think I am qualified enough to say: this is not one of the best, to say the least. The story started out well enough, but soon I became bored. By chapter four I was ready to close the book. I simply did not care for the babbling sniffling heroine Cecily and the boring knight Simon with his fever attacks. The story dragged on and on. If you want a sweet little story with a sweet hero and heroine, go ahead. But if you want a sizzling romance, buy something else."
5,a sophisticated mellow groove,"this album has a very definite, slow, mellow groove to it that just jumps into your head and won't go away. listen to it just makes you feel good to be alive. Buy it."
1,DONT DO IT,"No no no. I read the reviews here. I was tempted by the 5 star ratings. I am all about good regional bands. But this--UNCLE already. ""Like nothing you've ever heard before""? Maybe so, but if you can imagine Widespread suffering the misfortune of having to back Edwin McCain some cold and dreary early May Saturday at Blockbuster Pavillion, you really don't want to hear this CD. This is not the CD you're looking for. Move along. Move along."
2,What are your expectations?,"This is NOT stellar (or even capable) jam/jazz-funk/whatever (you know what I'm talking about) - more like ""jam-band lite"". If you enjoy the sounds of Matchbox 20 and their ilk and think that Phish's songs are too long and complicated, then this may be a great CD for you. Personally, I was VERY disappointed after being suckered by all the 5-star reviews. I have seen these guys live and, like most regional bands, their studio effort fails to capture their live energy/sound. That being said, I wasn't impressed with their live performance, either (YES, I caught a good show - the ""faithful"" told me it was ""classic"" . . . poor saps!). These guys are quaint, but lack the chops and conviction to engage this listener. I sold it after (too) many attempts to find some redeeming quality. A ""nice"" effort from a band that is undoubtedly a bunch of great guys, but ""Lore"" finishes where ""nice"" guys usually do . . . last."
2,Great start but tails off,"Architecture books seems to be one of the ""in"" titles now and the upcoming releases and are badly needed. However, this book does not provide a thorough treatment of the topic.The first two chapters begin well and if the remainder of the book had drilled into the issues, it would be superb, but such is not the case. Instead the result is an overview of much of the information security topic area.It is a good book for non-security IT professionals and perhaps useful in an introductory course as a text, but inadequate for in-depth work in infrastructure design.At the same time, this book is far superior to Held & Hundley's Security Architectures whichs dwells on Cisco PIX and router configurations and fails to consider how those pieces fit into a larger IT and IS architecture."
2,only one horn,"Hello,I'm confused with this product. Generally must be 2 horns low and high, however you shipped only one Low. Why?"
3,NO RESULTS,tried this product in accord with directions - no results. ordered again and increased dosage 50% - no results. ordered third time - doubled dosage and am getting only moderate results.
5,THE BEST THING EVER,She goes the other way when she spots poop in the yard. This pill has really helped with potty training as well. Would recommend this product to anyone.
3,Lack of coverage,The chip does not include the Army Corps of Engineers flood control lakes in Northern PA
2,"Good Idea, not economically competitive","Moisture Muncher seems to work well, but it was a disappointment to open the package and discover that they only recommend rejuvenating it three times. This information should have been printed where it could be seen before purchasing and opening the package. Silica Gel based products can be rejuvenated indefinitely and they are a better deal because they last longer. Sealife does not disclose what Muncher is made of, I tried to get them to tell me but they would not do so."
2,Be warned - Delete Key!,"My boss bought this keyboard for me at work (I am a software engineer), and the keyboard is fine...except for 1 major problem...the BIG DELETE KEY! What were Microsoft thinking!? I have been using the insert key for over a decade, and Microsoft in their wisdom decide to make the Delete key bigger and remove the Insert key.The F Lock key is a pain also, but there is registry fixes to disable this.So, thanks to this keyboard I have now deleted several hundred lines of code instead of pasting them!"
3,Keys stick!!,"If you play fps games and need to hold down keys for long periods of time, don't get this keyboard! I essentially can no longer play CS because any time I hold a key down with any amount of force, it seems to stick and continue moving me even after I release the key. Maybe for office purposes this is a decent keyboard, but for gaming, it's just bad."
2,Did not like proprietary layout,"I could not get use to the proprietary layout of the Delete, Home, End, Insert, Page Up, and Page Down keys. I do not like the way the function keys are setup nor do I like having to use the F Lock button. If you can get over these issues, then it might work well for you. If you have to use standard layout keyboards as well as this keyboard, then the two different layouts may cause you grief."
2,Average Keyboard,"Im using this product to type this maeesage. Well, I must say Im dissapointed with the product. The buttons dont require much force to push down. (which is nice) But the keys do NOT go down smoothly. I have never mistreated this keyboard.... so I know its not that. I bought it around 5 to 6 months ago. And in the last 2 months the problem began to occur. If some of the keys arent pressed down EXACTLY strait, the key will rub on the cheap platic shaft that its on. :( It makes it VERY irritating sometimes. Infact while typing this message, it happened 4 or 5 times. Im getting a Logitech next."
5,Easy to use and incredibly comfortable.,"This keyboard takes literally 5 minutes to install. The keys are easy to program, and it has never broken down in the year that I've owned it. The hand rest at the end of the keyboard makes typing much less tiring, and makes the keyboard better looking."
1,"Microsoft: ""Let's annoy people that buy our keyboard""","The first thing you might notice about this is that the home/end/delete/pageup/page down keys, along with Print Screen and Insert, are stragely located. The larger delete key can be nice, and the other keys are easy to get used to. What you won't realize from the picture:1) the space bar is exceptionally noisy if you hit it with your right thumb (which I almost exclusively do).2) The dreaded F key. Microsoft decided to add functionality to the f-keys by letting them operate as typical, F1-F12 keys, or as buttons to perform specific tasks (spell check, save, print, etc). You choose which the buttons operate as with the F lock key.F-lock on, they operate as F1-F12 like normal. F-lock off, they don't do anything useful.The f-lock key defaults off and often switches back to off for no reason.Wait -- it's very probable there is a reason for this: Microsoft hates us all."
2,F the F Lock,"One good thing: they FINALLY made it possible to disable the most useless key on the keyboard, the CapsLock. A stupid key that needs to be exiled to a remote part of the keyboard, if not eliminated altogether. Fortunately, it is now possible to disable this key. A proper fix simply would have moved it.But what the F is this F Lock key? Why is the default position 'OFF'? Why is there no way, (other than a registry fix) to change the default position of this key? Is MS once again going stupid on us?MS also thinks that we are all idiots, and that we delete more than we write. So they enlarged the delete key. Dumb idea. Return the insert key to where it belongs. My games need it there. And you know... the Start, and Menu key shouldn't be down where one might accidently press it while typing other stuff. More irritating than the Caps Lock.D+ MS. You can do better work."
5,YAY to ever-lasting relationship,This book is amazing. The scenarios that it gives you as examples you encounter in a relationship and how to change those moments into something witty and fun; just for you and your lover to share is just great. The ideas are phenomenal. I recommend this book to everyone! I actually got it from the library and now i ordered it. trust me you will love it. Men and women alike.
1,A money and time looser,"A trip to London with your kids can be delightful however you can have a very hard time if you try to follow this book suggestions as I did. The biggest problem is that it was probably updated many years ago. For instance the toys museum that is raccomanded in the book have been closed for three years, it's not fun to find it out after a one our walk with two toddlers. An other big problems is the pricing of the activities and transportation. England is an expensive country and you may want to be careful with your budget. This book is of no help since some of the prices are much higher than the ones reported while some other museums are now totally free.I wish I never bought it, it would have saved me a lot of time and money."
5,flugelhorn gig bag,"This one of the finest gig bags around.It is lightweight,strong and perfect for transporting your horn to the show.The horn fits great,just unzip and open the top for easy access."
3,"comet, butterfly & sword","First, I'm not good in English. So please arrange my sentence.This film is remake of ""killer Clans"" which was made about 1977. Based on the Chinese Chivarly novel. Original film is very good but new movie is disappointed."
5,Excellent,The actors bring the story to life as theplots unfold until the end of the film.The action seguences are outstanding.A job well done by the people that brought this movieto be for all to see.
2,WHAT???????,"This movie definitely had the potential to be gteat, the action scenes are pretty good. But the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing off during there own scenes.The final fight did't work for me either, and the very last scene I thought was pretty unnecessary. Did anyone really remember Joey Wong was in this movie by the time that the end came.The commentary on the DVD was one of the better ones that I have heard from ric meyers."
2,"Senseless plot, frenetic editing--for meth addicts only","If you're not on speed, good luck staying with this one. Yes, there are countless sets and stages filled with beautiful imagery. Yes, the actors seem to be thoroughly in character. But don't expect to get absorbed in even the smallest bit of story. This isn't a movie. It's a bloodsoaked, fly-through-the-air-while-decapitating-your-enemy music video."
4,great,cant wait to get on the water.the reel has a very good feel in your hand.they were shipped on the day they said and deliverd on the day they said.
1,wrong description,"The description was very misleading. I ordered a ""women's small/medium"" helmet for a friend of mine. After I had already altered the helmet with decorations, my son pointed out to me that the box said for children under 12 years of age. If I wasn't going to decorate it, I would have returned it due to scuff marks on it. It looked slightly used, but stated new in the ad. The shipping even took quite a bit longer than other things I ordered at the same time. Not a good experience."
3,Sizing Very Off,"Although I had read the reviews on this fitting children, being a petite 28 yr old woman, I expected this to fit. I'm about 5'4"" and 120 lbs. The Helmet ended up being so much bigger than expected, it wouldn't have even been safe if I had gotten into a bike crash and fell. I really don't know how this could have fit a child. That being said, the quality of the helmet for the price was great. It was a cute color too but, the sizing on this product needs to be more accurately described. I ended up returning and amazon was great about it."
3,Bible study,Not as useful in Bible Study as I thought. Did use it once or twice to look up some places and names.
3,"Ehh,","Its alright, its no Coheed by any matters. The vocals are similar to Axl Rose and the guitar similar to Slash, its ok. Good thing its just a side project."
4,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A W S O M EWow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
5,All 4 Me,"I love this album! I first heard ""All for You"" on the radio & as with most new songs the radio stations played it to death. But I loved it so much that each time I heard it, I'd turn it up & sing along. When they came to concert at a local club, I had to go. Even though I got stood up, I went by myself anyway. I couldn't believe how many people knew *MY* new group AND could sing all their songs that I'd never heard before. That was the night that they announced ""All for You"" went platinum; I was so thrilled to be a part of it. The next day I had to go out and buy this album, Somewhere More Familiar. I enjoy all of Sister Hazel's songs on this album; they always bring up my mood, get me singing & dancing! I'd have to say that ""Starfish"" has become my 'happy' song. I highly recommend this album. I try to introduce Sister Hazel to all my friends!"
2,Not that great really!,"I bought this C.D. a year ago and although I liked ""All for you"" and ""Happy"" I felt all the rest of the songs sounded the same-they were kinda dull. I haven't listened to the C.D. since I bought it, so I wouldn't suggest buying it!"
2,A Jimmy Buffet Want-to-be,"I bought the CD for ""Happy"", and ""All for you"" The only other song I liked on the CD is ""Concede"" All the songs start sounding the same, and I swear that at least 3 songs have the EXACT same notes the first 3 seconds or so. If you like Jimmy Buffet you will love this CD. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
5,"Great music for any time of day, any mood!","I never had a favorite band until I heard Sister Hazel at Centennial Park in Atlanta and bought the album. Not a ""B"" side on it! Every song is a hit, and the great harmonies the guys make are great to listen to no matter what the weather, no matter what your mood. A great combination of upbeat music with great messages! To top it off, each of the members is probably the best musician in their field, especially drummer Mark Trojanowski and lead guitar Ryan Newell. This is a must-have album for anyone who needs a break from rock and roll."
4,This band is simply AMAZING!,"I wanted to give these guys the ""5"" Star rating, but I thought they might let up on the next album. I hope that they continue to put out this ""Feel Good"" music. My two boys (eight and five) have most of the songs memorized. My five year old ALWAYS wants to hear the ""Starfish"" song."
5,Simple and Heartfelt Music,"Can Sister Hazel's sound be desicribed as groundbreaking? Unique? Original? No, no, and no. But if you want a great band with heartfelt lyrics and amazing talent, Sister hazel is the band for you. While there simple songs will not reduce you to tears, Hazel brings music back to where it started, simple and easy to listen to, and on top of that, one member of Sister Hazel has more class then all the bands you heard on the radio yesterday put together. This band is completely understated. If anyone out there is looking for some great, simple music, buy this CD."
5,The best CD that can be found!!!,"These men have all the great points down in music. good lyrics, good music, VERY clean. not ONE SLIVER of profanity in the WHOLE CD! I must admit, some of the songs do sound alike, yet if you're one of those people that listen closely to lyrics, you'll love the individuality and hidden messages you can find in each song that make your day brighter! 'cereline' and 'concede' will make you value being in love, this is the best CD you'll ever find!!!"
5,Enjoyable Album,"Sister Hazel's ""Somewhere More Familiar"" is a refreshing and unique acoustic rock album. The fresh, true lyrics and smooth harmonies make it great music to listen to anytime you feel like taking a break from the fast-paced world."
3,Not easy to follow,"I agree with the previous poster. I was very excited to try this method of stretching, and I believe it is an excellent method but this DVD isn't the way to learn. There is no real flow to the video and each exercise is only done a few times on one side, creating a lot of starts and stops. Because the movements are not repeated often enough, and the camera angles frequently don't show the entire view, what should be a superb experience becomes a maddening one."
1,Terrible. Bad Willie. Bad Reggae. Bad Idea. Bad Delivery,"This CD seemed interesting in theory. Hmm. Grab a great country musician, team him up with some other great musicians (Toots, for one) and record an album in a different genre. Problem is, the songs are too country to be reggae, but too reggae to sound country. What it winds up sounding like is one of those Kidsongs albums.This album IS worth listening to, once. See if a friend has it, or share the price. You will NOT listen again.Instead of buying it, you are better off buying a different Willie album, like Shotgun Willie, or Stardust. Or, you can buy some Toots and the Maytalls."
1,oh dear me - no!,"This album is so bad that one well known Country music video channel is giving it away free on their website - well the sound files anyway! (not physically sending people the CD for free). Okay, the best way to describe this is 1) Willie does his great vocals in a small studio somehwere and then gets a producer to email the sound files in mp3 to Jamaica where a man with a 4 track mixer gets out a copy of a UB40 Karaoke album his mother have him for Xmas. A few glases of Bajan rum later and he emails the mixed sound files back to Willie. Willie then gets his producer.....oh you get the idea."
2,Pretty Average,expectations are always kinda high for Willie Nelson because He has shown overtime a very Versatile Ability at making whatever style of music He was doing that He could make it fit&work. but here it sounds very watered down.this Album might work for Jimmy Buffett but for Willie Nelson it's not really happening.some interesting moments.
1,What was he thinking?,"I must be listening to a different album that the previous reviewers, or maybe you all need to pass that blunt so I can get stupid enough to enjoy this.Neslon cops some fake dub beats and lays a twangy guitar over the whole thing and calls it reggae. This is NOT reggae in any sense.A complete waste of time and a waste of Nelson's talent.[...] put it far more succinctly than I ever could ""There isn't enough ganja in Kingston, or enough whiskey in Nashville to make this work""."
3,"Good CD, don't pass judgement","People who are outraged that Willie is doing a ""reggae"" CD need to stop. It's the same willie just with a reggae beat in the backround. Willie is just experimenting and I'm just happy he's still making music. Cleary not his best stuff, but tracks ""do you mind..."" ""worried man"" the harder they fall"" and ""destroyed the world"" are worth downloading off itunes. Willie will always be one of the greatest country singers of all time in my book, and CD should not taint his legacy."
1,Say it aint so,"Willie is one of the greatest recording artists of all time, but somebody needs to flush Willie's stash down the toilet which is were this albumn should go."
4,Gives a good buzz.,"I'd been meaning to get this since the first time I even heard of it. Recently it showed up used for one penny. Seemed like a good time to get it. Great album. I can understand how someone strictly into country or reggae might not dig it, but the open-minded should love it. It's a fairly natural fit, Willie and reggae. Was this release really a surprise to anybody?What I like most is that it's not a reggae album with Willie singing, it's a Willie album with reggae touches. It doesn't overwhelm the music, it just adds to it. The songs are solid. There's a few covers here (Cash/Cliff), and a guest vocal from Toots Hibbert. I believe the same track as on his True Love album. Anyway, if the very idea of this seems interesting to you, and you're a Willie fan in the slightest, light it up!"
4,Willie can do reggae very nicely,"As a fan of Willie Nelson and an even bigger fan of reggae music I have to say I really enjoy this. It's a great balance of country instrumentation, reggae style and to top it off....the voice of the Red-Headed Stranger. Is it perfect? No. But it could've gone a lot worse. I'd buy it."
1,Let's Play Clue!,"Who killed what should have been a killer album? (I mean Willie Nelson should sound even cooler singing reggae than Johnny Cash did, right? RIGHT?!)I say it was Don Was in the studio with too much polish and a tin ear.Open the card... did I win? Did I win? Did I win?"
1,Don't ruin Reggae with Country PLEASE!,Cut out the damn Twang in this whole album and I might listen to it! Country Music sucks!!! It should never be mentioned in the same sentence as Reggae ever again. CMT Crappiest Music on Television!
5,Fun unique CD,"Didn't expect Amazon to get the CD to me so fast, but am sure glad I bought it. Very unique style. Doesn't come in a plastic CD holder, but classy cardboard. Admit that it was the marijuana plant on the cover and the fact that it was Willies take on reggae that attracted me to the CD. Have always loved the Caribbean region and since I read a lot have come to know that most of my favorite country singers have some connection to the region either as a favorite vacation spot or second home base. Love the song Johnny Cash wrote which is tract 3. Well worth buying."
5,Love Countryman!!,"It's not traditional Willie Nelson and it's not traditional reggae, but if you like Willie and you like reggae you will like this album. The man can't do wrong, he's brilliant. ""Worried Man"", written by Johnny & June (Carter) Cash is an awesome song. Lyrically, it has the potential of being a very somber tune, but with Willie's spin on it and Toots Hibbert sharing the vocals, it's more uplifting than anything else. The entire album is great, definitely recommend buying it."
1,Let sleeping dogs and terrible musical ideas lie.,I wish there was a 0 Star rating.This Cd is bad on two levels.Bad Reggae and Bad Country.Should not have been disinterred.
1,doesn't really work.,"Sounds like they added the reggae rhythms on top of good recordings of of reggae covers and Willie standards. Also the reggae rhythms sound a bit artificial next to the more fluid steel guitar playing and Willie's singing. It's actually hard to tell which style is more stiffling to the other.Zillions of great Willie Nelson albums of there to be discovered- if you want something interested and slightly obscure of his, check out Moonlight Becomes You- he does country mixed with hot club jazz and ballads- a distant cousin of the Stardust album."
2,Willie and the Pitch Shifter - what a CRIME,"I tried really hard to give this a fair listen, but while tracking ""Sitting in Limbo"" tonight, I can hear the unmistakable synthesizer-like tones of a pitch shifter. That's the auto-tune vocal tracking tool you have heard about. You use a pitch shifter to make non-musical singers get in key with the backing instruments. Clueless young act like Brittney Spears, Ashley Simpson and people like that get put through a pitch shifter. But not Willie!! You don't turn Willie Nelson into a Cylon, people!I have seen Willie live and he really does have amazing talent, he can really play and he can sing and carry a tune ... but you wouldn't know it from this slick over-produced mess.What a crying shame - anybody who put Willie Nelson's great voice through a freaking Pitch Shifter deserves to be shot ... I'm going to put this album up for sale and hope I don't hear these tracks again ... so sad!"
4,No Keyboard Lights and Only 2 Mouse Buttons . . .,I really like this set and have had no problems in almost one month of daily usage. However the lack of a caps lock light and only 2 buttons on the mouse have ruined my enjoyment of this keyboard. It's going back.Why in the world has Microsoft chosen to delete these features???
4,"nice, but has downsides","I really like having a wireless keyboard. But, I wanted to note some annoying downsides:+ There is a delay after bootup, during which I cannot use the mouse or keyboard. So, it takes longer to log into windows.+ The F-lock key is really annoying because it's setting is not stored. Each time you reboot, your F1-F12 keys are pretty much useless until you hit F-lock. The MS defined meaning of the function keys without hitting F-lock are no good for someone who is used to the normal meaning of those keys.+ Non-standard home, end, pageup, pagedown etc, is also annoyingfor anyone who uses multiple keyboards. Ther is only one insert key.+ Post-boot delay also affects RH linux. It looks like lineak.sf.net supports this device, but I have not bothered with customizing the extra keys yet."
3,CAREFUL!! Security problem,It is as good as many make out and is the FIRST keyboard where I actually thought the EXTRA keys were worth the extra software install.But be aware:In a 2.4GHz radio dense environment - Cordless Phones; Wireless Network etc this keyboard may have trouble finding a clear radio channel. There are only 11 and only 3 do not overlap each other a bit. So you are limited to around 5 items in range of each other. (Including your neighbors with their 2.4GHz radio devices)I have had problems with two keyboards 40ft apart causing one to type on the other computer. Forcing a channel hop to a clear channel does not do it - kept fetching up back at the same channel as the other keyboard.Finally and ABSOLUTELY crucial - not recommended in a secure environment. Someone with a receiver for the keyboard could be just the other side of the wall - tracking EVERYTHING you type..........
2,Lots of problems,"I like the keyboard: it is very easy to type on, and I mostly like the mouse: it feels great in your hand.Maybe there is something wrong with my set, but my keyboard just stops working for about a week after i change the batteries, then it seems to fix itself. I got sick of it last week and bought a Logitech, which I recommend over the Microsoft set. The mouse also had a problem too. Occasionally, it will just move the arrow to the bottom right corner for no apparent reason. This usually doesn't bother me, except when I am playing games like Counterstrike, I start spinning around in circles and looking at the ground. VERY ANNOYING. Get a Logitech instead."
4,XP at fault,"I have the keyboard working again. I was told to reinstall it, because XP has a glitch that causes Microsoft keyboards to mess up. Seems fine now. Sorry Bill."
1,Works-- -- sometimes..,For three weeks it worked great. Now it will not type lowercase letters consistently.
2,"Flaky wireless connection, great keyboard and mouse","I have two identical wireless Natural multimedia keyboards and mice. Fabulous keyboard, great touch and layout, I can type all day on it. HATE the flaky wireless connection - When first starting up, I regularly have to fight to re-establish a decent wireless connection between the keyboard and receiver. It only picks up every other keystroke, sporadic reception... this is with the receiver sitting within 6"" of the keyboard. Once a decent connection is established, it works great! Same problem with identical wireless sets on different machines. Grrrr very frustrating, but once it gets going it works flawlessly."
5,i love it i love it i love it!!!,"i love this!! it's awesome. i got the 1st generation MS Optical mouse (wired) and i must say this wirelss mouse is even better than my original MS wired mouse. anyhow, the only problem i guess is the battery wears out every 2 weeks but i have a load of recharables so it's no biggie for me. i think one thing that'll take a bit of getting used to is the placement of some keys are slightly off from the original wired Microsoft Natural Keyboard which I've been used to like the up and down arrows and the home, end, delete button. but i'll guess i'll get used to it. anyhow, all i can say is wireless is great!!"
2,Disappointed,"Got it as a gift, and could not configure mouse, even with software upgrade from MS. Note: other reviewers did not rate keyboard/mouse combination for natural keyboard -- the combo was not released untile December 16, 2002. Tried to install mouse on three different machines, without success. On one system, the radio signal from the cordless devices interfered with my wireless internet set up -- worked fine once again, when the keboard combo was removed."
2,Purchase a battery store for this one - you'll need it!,In general I like the keyboard layout and the mouse. The biggest problem I have with the keyboard is its battery consumption. I go through a pair of batteries pretty much every couple of weeks.
1,not durable,"I bought this as a replacement for the Nikon EN-EL1 (for an old CoolPix 8700). The Lenmar label indicates 7.4 V 750mAh 5.6Wh. THe EN-EL1 label indicates 7.4V 1100mAh 8.14Wh. So the Lenmar should not hold a charge as long as the original battery. HOWEVER, after about a year of very little use, the Lenmar no longer charges at all. Cannot recommend at all....search for an alternative."
3,Lasted almost 2 years,"I had to give it a 3 star rating since the Nikon battery that was sent with the camera and is older is still going strong. A friend sent me a Nikon Coolpix 8700 to use a few years ago and I bought this battery as a back up in Oct 2008. The past month or so the battery goes dead soon after putting it in the camera. I would trade off batteries during use so guessing both brands have been used and charged the same amount of time and I would say the camera had a light to medium use. But the battery worked Ok up until recently, now I have to find something else.......... I'm not sure how much use the camera and Nikon battery had before it was sent to me but if money is not an issue, Nikon seems to be the way to go....."
2,Waste of money,There is a reason why this stuff sells for 1/5 of the price of an original Nikon battery. Does not hold the charge for long. May be around 50 photos and it dies off. Buy the original Nikon battery even if it costs more.
4,"Not perfect, but it'll get the job done","i spend my entire workday in front of my computer so naturally i needed something more comfortable than the stock keyboard that was given to me by my empolyer. i use a natural pro at home and am very happy with it. the natural multimedia has a similar look, but feels very different. the keystroke is a lot smoother, almost feels spongy. the extra multimedia buttons on the top... i don't use them. oh yeah, and the keyboard is noticibly heavier and takes up more space than a stock keyboard...there are two main things that really annoy me: the function keys (F1-F12) have been replaced by M$ with shortcuts for things like help, undo, redo, open, close, reply, fwd, send, spell, save, print. you can still use the F-keys, but you have to press the FLock button first. annoying. also, there is an oversized delete button -- it sits where the insert button and a normal sized delete button sit."
2,Much different feel than previous MS Naturals,"I'm a long term user of Microsoft Natural keyboards and am a programmer who types all day (and night). I needed a new one and found a deal on this version (it was cheaper than a new Natural Pro, I guess because it's not USB), but was glad that I tried it out in a store first. They've completely change the feel of the keys; they're soft and spongy, rather than crisp like the previous models (Natural Pro and Natural Elite). Some people might prefer this, but I definitely didn't and am going to stick with a Natural Pro."
5,Great Keyboard,"I love this keyboard. I had one before, which my puppy destroyed. I had to get another, because I love it so much. They media keys are very useful, and I really like the ergonomic form."
4,Good keyboard for the money,"I have two of these keyboards, one at work and one at home. The feel of the keys is a bit different than other keyboards, it has a softer feel. The media buttons at the top for volume, play/pause, etc... are quite nice. The F keys by default do things like Undo, New, Open, etc... and can be quite annoying. However, a quick Google search should lead you to a simple registry hack that fixes this problem for you.The keyboard I have at home has a left shift key that sticks sometimes (and has since the day I bought it) but the one I have at work is perfect."
1,Not worth the purchase,"This keyboard is the cheapest feeling keyboard I've ever used. Only after a few days of typing the keys started to stick and requires a little more effort to press some keys. In general it feels more stiff when typing rather than a nice cushy feel. This never happened from the other 5 keyboards I've used. If you really want to get a Microsoft keyboard then try getting the Elite which I also own.As for the ergonomic layout, I've noticed that it's not completely neccesary. If I use a standard keyboard that doesn't try to save money by compacting the keys together then I don't get wrist problems. You have to find a keyboard that provides a good amount of space between each keys. Although you still need to use a wrist pad and the flatter the keyboard the better.But no matter what you do don't waste your money on this keyboard."
3,A brief review,"Having read the other books of Mr. Miller and enjoyed them, I was looking forward to this little book. I think Mr. Miller has finally lost the plot! He is so uncritical of the show it's an embarrassment. His critical faculties have sailed out the window! HAIR's music is a Wonder but the lyrics and book (?) are atrocious and often gibberish. The revelatory experiences Mr. Miller claims his cast had performing a production are Not their audience's response,i would imagine. An audience cannot always appreciate the research a cast has invested, it sees the product not the process. Miller is looking at his subject from the inside. I am surprised that Mr. Miller has descended to this ""tribal"" love-stuff. He never steps back from his subject and discerns its weakness. His efforts have actually steered me away from this musical."
3,SERVE THE PURPOSE,THE POT IS LIGHTER WEIGHT THAN I THOUGHT. THE HANDLE ENDS THAT FIT THROUGH THE BASKET CATCH ON THE POT. A METABO CAME IN HANDY IN GRINDING DOWN THE ENDS A LITTLE. IT IS FINE NOW.
3,Stainless Steel Stockpot,"Before purchasing this pot, or any other stockpot for that matter, you need to determine your primary purpose for the pot. Steaming or boiling. The basket sits two inches or so off the bottom of the pot which makes this pot excellent for steaming. If you are mostly going to boil then you should look for a pot where the basket sits closer to the bottom. That gives you more room to boil. This pot is very attractive and cleans up easily. The only drawback is that the handles are too close to the sides and top of the pot. It makes it difficult to carry for people with average to large hands."
2,Not Impressed,Three of the six welds holding the handle to the lid popped loose the first time I heated this pot up. The gauge is not as thick as I was hoping for and the bottom stained terribly the first time I used this pot. My Martha Stewart stock pot from K-Mart was much better quality than this thing. I was just hoping to have a nice quality larger pot. I won't buy this brand again.
5,Best Cooker for the Money,I bought this cooker for a crawfish boil and it worked beautifully. The steamer basket makes removing the contents a breeze. I will also be using the pot for making home brewed beer.
5,Good quality...,"I've only had the Bayou Classic 44-quart for a month, but, so far, it's great. I've used it for steaming oysters, lobsters and shrimp."
4,BIAB Brew Pot,"I got this to make a Brew In A Bag setup. It works very well, just wish it were a little thicker. It is very nice for the use."
5,Crabs Please,"I was tired of the price of crabs here in Baltimore so I bought ""this here pot hun"" to steam my own and save some money, beside the seasoning I use tastes better then what ""they"" had been putting on the crabs.Works great love it. ""Ain't the beer cold""(and the crabs great)Jay"
4,"Good, but not great.","I bought this as an alternative for a black ceramic crab pot steamer thinking the stainless would hold up better that the ceramic coated metal pot. I've gotten about 5 yrs use from those before a hole begins. Anyway, I've only used the new stainless pot 3 times and I've noticed it gets much hotter, much quicker which makes you have to increase your liquid capacity so it doesn't all boil away. Not too big of a deal. Also the crabs have a much easier time grasping and climbing the perforated basket than the smooth surface of the aforementioned ceramic pot which makes for some interesting escapes. Nonetheless, I hope to get more yrs of use from this pot and if it holds true, then I can adjust to the quirks for my specific application."
1,China made JUNK --- many problems!,"1) Had I known it was made in China --- I would have never spend this ridiculous high price!2) The pot arrived REPAIRED --- not dented (since packaging was excellent), but with a flattened lip on one side (about 1"" of the lip) that showed heating marks and sanding scratches trying to get it somewhat straight (also due to the sanding, rust was showing)!3) The handles are NOT riveted (as stated and pictured), but welded!4) The bottom is THIN --- you can poke it with your finger and it will move in-and-out!4) The basket was also repaired, and it can only fit inside the pot by hitting it with your fist (taking it out when hot is dangerous, since force is needed to disengage from the pot, and hot liquid sprays on you)!5) The lid has a tiny ding on the inside --- a pinprick --- and it had already started to rust even before adding any water!In conclusion --- what I got is China Made Garbage (how others award it so many stars remains a mystery)!"
1,product quality,this product could be dangerous the basket does not fit right it hangs up could turn over if your not careful China made same story
2,you would expect higher quality for the price,"This pot was not inexpensive, but now I wish I spent more and found a higher quality item. I prefer to buy items that last a lifetime even if they are more expensive. It did the trick of steaming crabs for 50 people, but it couldn't do it again. The botom of the pot is buckled and ready to break after being used for 4 hours of steaming. It never ran dry and we kept the heat down, it is just paper-thin."
3,"Ok, but not great.","I purchased these as a gift for my Mom since she is remodeling her kitchen and I wasn't impressed with how they shipped and came out of the box. They were not wrapped well so the burners banged against other things in the box and chipped them a little in places. If I wasn't giving them to her the minute I got them, I would probably have returned them since they were chipped. I only bought them because I couldn't find any around here for some reason and I got free shipping since I ordered other things. Otherwise, I probably would not have purchased them. They serve the purpose since I put country star decals on them and covered up some of the chips, but when you pay for something, it shouldn't come chipped."
1,Cheap looking and cheesy!,These covers do not lay flat over the burners. They were very ill-fitting and looked very cheap! Would not recommend anyone purchasing this item. It is a waste of money!
3,Really flimsy,"Very lightweight - so much so that one arrived already dented from shipping. I only planned to use two, and besides I can see that they will quickly be dented from ordinary use, so I didn't send them back. They clearly would melt in about a second if you accidentally turned on the burner under them. For the price, they are OK."
3,look nice but,"They look nice but a bit lightweight. As long as you;re careful not to knock them around or put a heavy item on top of them, they will be ok. Nice white finish on them. They do the job if you don't knock them around."
4,Slow Starter,"This was an Amazon recommendation. I'm a relative newby to this type of show. My main exposure was what was shown on TV growing up, Starblazers and Robotech come to mind. I have gotten sucked in to Naruto this past year. I've also seen episodes here and there of the anime shown on Cartoon Network as well. I've been looking for something more so when Amazon suggested this I gave it a try.It started off slow. It wasn't bad just slow. I almost didn't continue, but by the time I got to the last disk I was right back on Amazon looking for the next box set which doesn't appear to be available yet unfortunately. Will definitely order the next set."
1,"Good show, bad set.","I've ordered this exact same box set on two different occasions. The first time I ordered it, I got to episode 2 and it skipped miserably. It got so frustrating to the point to where it wasn't watchable so I returned it. The second time, I was watching the replacement that Amazon had sent me and, well, the same exact thing happened. Both times they were brand new products, and both times they had problems playing. I've watched tons of anime on my blu ray player and never had this problem before. So buyer beware, when you buy this set it may or may not work properly."
1,Some discs came scratched,"Death Note is a fantastic show, but some of the discs came scratched and froze when I watched certain episodes. I didn't watch the later episodes until a long time after I purchased them and I couldn't return the product because the time window had passed. Frustrated, I bought a digital copy instead."
3,BEWARE,"Beware of two things if you are considering purchasing this specific box set - to get closure on the L and Light relationship, you will also have to buy Death Note 2, and this is a DARK series. Read all the reviews before making your decision, if you have younger, impressionable children.Our 15-year old talked me into buying this first set and I did not research it as I should have. Our family likes lighter anime, so while this series is extremely well-done in many respects, we felt we had to ""hang in"" til the last episode because we wanted closure on what became of the characters only to find we had to buy Death Note 2 (as it's sold on Amazon) for an additional 4 episodes to learn what became of L and Light.Also beware you may not like the ending."
4,"If you're a fan, or if your'e looking for a great anime ""Cat and mouse"", this is it.","I should start off by stating that I'm not an Anime freak and I only own a few. But I had caught a couple episodes on adult swim and became interested but couldn't keep up. I decided to get the first box set and watched all 17 episodes in the first two days. The art is beautiful and the twists will keep even the sharpest movie detective guessing. They do a wonderful job not letting many characters become cookie cutter/one dimensional. You're not sure if you like any of the characters and and soon as you lean one way, they show you another color. It's very interesting visually and mentally. I would, however, recommend ordering BOTH box sets at the same time because it's almost painful when you realize that you're done for a while. OH YEAH, and it was here in LESS than 24 hours and I just used standard shipping. SO WORTH THE MONEY!"
4,one of my favorites,love this series would have given 5stars but my boxset was a little beat up other then that no complaints
3,An in-depth first-hand account of the Phoenix Lights,Lynne's first-hand account and thorough investigation of the Phoenix Lights incident. It's a fun book and a must-read if you're interested in this happening.
2,"A Personal Journey...Been There, Done That","Having followed the Phoenix Lights mystery for several years now, I must admit that when I saw this book I was quite excited. Unfortunately, what I discovered was just another author on a personal journey. The title of the book is misleading to say the least! What it should say is, ""We may not be alone."" After painfully trudging through a rehash of things most of us that have followed this story already know, Dr. Lynne puts us to sleep with all of her personal 'revelations.' You know you're in trouble when the vast majority of her 'discoveries' end with a question mark. These are not hard facts, but simply an author posing questions to her readers as well as to herself. She is missing the mark. Dr. Lynne may feel exhilarated, but quite frankly I'm left quite disappointed ."
3,The Phoenix Lights,"Overall, an interesting read. I found aspects of the story compelling, especially the parts regarding the photographic analysis of the lights themselves (though the pictures included in the book where not very good). Dr. Kitei's investigation into the lights appeared thorough and she did confirm multiple sources of information regarding the sighting. However, in the end the story just seemed to fizzle - once again, no confirmations from the military or the government on what seemed to be a rather extensively witnessed event backed by serious photographic evidence. While Dr. Kitei pulled at the strings and gathered together a good case, little resulted from her efforts."
2,"So, Whatever Did Happen to Nathan Jr.?","From Raising Arizona to ... this?Actually, I was raised with the good advice that ""if you don't have anything nice to say about someone or something then don't say anything at all"" - advice which I must admit I haven't followed with all that much regularity.But in the case of Dr. Kitei's ... memoir, I will try to make an exception.Currently, there are two books dealing with the fascinating events known as the Phoenix lights. Neither of them satisfactorily document this series of UFO sightings with sufficient detail or descriptive rigor. However, Mr. Hamilton's The Phoenix Lights Mystery is the superior effort and the only one worth reading.I say this without any animosity towards Lynne Kitei. Dr. Kitei certainly put a lot of herself into the writing of this book. Unfortunately, way too much to make it interesting for a reader who is primarily curious about discovering whatever it was that did happen in and around Phoenix."
1,Rubbish,"First let me say I am a beleiver in the UFO phenomenon. However, the special on saw on TLC absolutely proved to me the Phoenix lights were flares. But, I guess people will beleive almost anything, if it make their theory correct."
5,Ever consider ballons?,Some of the events after the BIG 1997 events were just balloons with lights attached!!!
5,Beautiful and Funny,"The drawings are quite beautiful, as well as entertaining. The captions for each picture were perfect. I love it. I received the book well packaged, and addressed. Thanks."
5,Furry Logic,This book puts a smile on my face! The pictures are great and the sayings are wonderful reminders about life.
5,Perfect book for gift giving!,"Someone at my office purchased this book on a whim. It has been passed around to everyone in the department and now everyone wants a copy (sometimes more than 1 copy!). One lf the girls is even making a special trip to the touristy boutique where the book was purchased to pick up copies for all of us. The drawings are so life-like and the animal expressions are perfectly suited to the droll sayings. This book is a real ""pick-me-up"" and is sure to make you smile and even laugh outright!"
5,Furry Logic,"What exquisite illustrations, what reassuring words. A precious little jewel of a book to be salivated over anywhere - the bathroom, the car, a mountaintop, to remind one that life is precious and to live it to the full. (it tells you how to do it too!)"
4,Furry Logic: A Guide to Lifes Little Changes,Very cute pick me up type of book. I give the book as holiday and Birthday gifts. Everyone loves it.
4,Hilarious until the end,"This book made everyone in my family laugh which is quite the task...that is until the last few pages. A little past halfway through, the humor hits a dead point and the book is no longer funny, but I would definently buy it again for the first half."
5,"Another excellent service and book, all together",I am absolutely satisfied - Thanks so much. How lovely when it goes so smooth like this. I am grateful
3,Gorgeous voice!,"If you like listening to Judy Collins or Mary Hopkin, you will like listening to Catherine McKinnon. Her singing is clear, crisp, celestial."
3,You get what you pay for,"Cameras owned: Canon Rebel XTi, Canon 7D. Bought this set for the 7D.I've tried out two filters on this set. The UV filter doesn't do jack, but I wasn't thinking it would. I really just needed a filter lens to protect my lens, which this does great.I haven't tried out the polarizer lens yet, but I'm almost willing to bet it's not great.The fluorescent light filter lens is TERRIBLE. It just makes everything look pink... doesn't really do much more than that.But if you're getting this set because it's cheap, the shipping is free, etc. etc. etc., this will do the trick. But honestly, I wish I spent $30 and got a better lens kit."
5,Very pleased with transaction and return.,"I bought the lens on amazon with my credit card and the package was shipped to me in a timely manner. The lens were in great condition and exactly what I had ordered but unfortunately, they were not the right size. Luckily, the seller had a wonderful 15 day return policy, I mailed the lens back to them with the order form and they gave me a full refund, minus the cost of the return shipping of course."
2,Opteka not Sakar,"2 Stars for not selling what is listed. Opteka filter sets not Sakar. The filters are not sharp, but they shouldn't be either for the amount you pay. These are great for any older gear you may have laying around."
4,You get what you pay for with the CPL,"The CPL in this kit introduces significant distortion when used at the long end of the zoom range. I have an 18-200mm lens and significant picture degradation is added by the polarizer when taking images at the 200mm limit. It's unfortunate I can't upload sample images to show the difference with and withouth the CPL. The UV filter I found to be of good quality and no visible distortion is introduced. I am giving 4 stars because considering the price, you are really getting what you pay for and perhaps a bit more."
1,Not at all what I was told!,"I bought this from one of Amazon's sellers and ended up with something that looked like the KitchenAid flat beater but was a cheap version and looked used. After complaining, I got a new one and threw away the old one. Amazon was great at making sure the company reinbursed me. I would doublecheck before ordering with a different company."
5,A Classic,"A little known, little watched movie, but classic Bing Crosby and Betty Hutton. (By the way, my mom was in the movie as one of the singing WAVEs, so I am a bit biased)."
5,Amazing story,"Amazing story that is alternately thrilling and depressing if anyone can turn such a downer story into something grand Simon Schama certainly can. Not to gush but the more I watch presentations by this guy the better I like him. This is one of those times where I could write 5,000 words and not begin to express how good ""rough crossing"" is, so do yourself a favor and check this out now.Overall-Spellbinding why does no one in America know this story? It may be slightly preachy but it is mostly about a particularly ugly series of events in Human history."
2,Be Sure You Know What You're Buying,"There are several editions of this book now in print. Some would fall into the category of ""coffee table"" (beautiful oversized) books. Others however, are simply smaller reissues and by smaller I mean that they are soft bound, less than an inch think and not even as large as an 8.5X11 sheet of paper - not a coffee table book by any means. I personally think that the photography suffers in the smaller less expensive editions - quality isn't anywhere close to what I expect from a Sam Carson book. If you are looking to purchase this book be absolutely certain that you know if you're buying the 2009 smaller paperback edition or one of the earlier larger editions - if buying from an Amazon seller email in advance with questions as to which version they are offering as some sellers may not realize that there are numerous editions currently available and may have listed their copy incorrectly."
5,DVD about saving the Mustangs,"I got this DVD for my granddaughter but had to check it out myself first. I highly recommend it for adults as well as children. Loved the fact the girl saved them through taking pictures of them. It can show children that there is a way they can get active in what they believe in.Also it showed everyone who is in law enforcement is not always honest. We always like to think so. I know my husband is. Most everyone I know here is. But in some cities, they aren't.We need to take a stand for what is right even when the government may not stand behind us."
3,"Not bad, but not good.","Cute. That's the first word that comes to mind when I watch this movie. The plot has been done so many times it's truly impossible to come up with anything original along the same lines. It's the sort of movie you can watch when you don't want anything that would make you think. Miranda Cosgrove is an amazing, talented actress, so this movie fit her pretty well. Still, the movie is a pleasant diversion for a rainy afternoon."
3,Wild Stallion,"I bought this movie at our local Movie Gallery because it was closing and the movies were 50 -70% off the original price. The Wild Stallion lacked at the part to keep the viewers interest. It had good parts and its lows. As a fan of Miranda Cosgrove and iCarly, I was disappointed. Overall, it was an alright film but if your looking for a watch to love, you'll be disappointed."
4,Good listen of Piedmont style blues,This is just good listening if you like blues. Nice guitar and vocals from Cephas and harmonica from Wiggins. Not a classic but well worth buying.
4,Sweet voice & good lyrics make the grade,"Wood Work is a rewarding album to listen to. Beth Wood has a beautiful voice and puts good emotion into her singing, which ranges from the sweetness of ""Here Is a Rose"" to the power of ""Thin Lines"". Her lyrics are refreshingly free of pseudo-angst--unlike so many new artists, Beth doesn't appear to believe the only way to fame is bitterness. Stand-out songs: ""Mean Time,"" ""Love Letters,"" and ""Geometry."" Also, if you see her in concert, ask for ""Dr. Feelgood""--a rockin' rendition!"
5,An Excellent Training Tool!,I'm so glad I stumbled on this book and CD-rom. I was looking for something that would give me and edge in taking the 473-C exam and this book and CD-rom was the ticket. I recently took the exam and scored high enough to get called for an interview within 2 weeks of receiving my test score. The exam is very daunting if you don't prepare. I believe that approx. 90% of the people taking the exam don't pass or pass with a low score which limits their chances of getting called. The helpful tips and practice tests really helped me in the actual taking of the exam and in instilling a sense of confidence. Mr. Parnell understands the nature of this test and explains all aspects in great detail. I heartily recommend this if you want to score high enough on this test to get called for an interview.
4,Better than the book,"Was better than the book. The cd was so real...they time you as they gone to time you at the test. Make you feel secure, It's was like take the test at home."
5,Seiko Alarm Clock,"Dependable product (for me, this one replaced another that has been in use for many years). The styling is perfect: the dial that lights up has easy to see numbers, and the size of the unit is just right. The alarm clock function is simple to use."
4,Seiko Clock,"Great clock, price excellent, replacing an older model..Only downside is the large plastic case whick is sort of a distraction...but a great value and works great"
2,This is not silent! Noisy second hand!,"If you want a silent clock, don't buy this one. The second hand is not ""sweep"", it is a ""tick-tick"". In a quiet environment, it is really annoying. Other than that, it is a decent clock, but I can't use it in my bedroom."
5,Seiko Bedside Alarm,"Love this clock! It looks elegent and would go well with male or female decore. I have had it over a year now and keeps good time. I especially like that this ""little gem"" does not have that annoying click you hear with most battery operated clocks. The alarm is not wimpy and will wake you. The snooze button is handy but be careful you don't accidently disengage the alarm button. I found the alarm easy to set but turns off easily if you tap the snooze button or jar the clock."
3,All Plastic,"I bought this to replace my old Howard Miller alarm clock that had finally died. That one was all metal. This one is all plastic and lightweight. It does say ""gold tone"" in the description, but I was still expecting the gold of it to be metal. That said, it's a nice clock. So hard to find one with an on-demand illuminated dial."
1,Seiko Alarm Clock,The clock was larger than I expected and the back of the clock is grey plastic...very cheap-looking. I knew instantly that I would be returning the item. I ended up with a loss of $10. on a $37. item; I had to pay the return shipping and a re-stocking fee. I will not be ordering anything from Amazon in the near future unless I have seen the item first-hand before ordering. The re-stocking fee I felt was unfair.
1,Disappointed with this clock,"Bought the silver version of this clock. Clock is cheap and tacky. Bought for a gift and must return it or use it for some garage sale. The GLOWING reviews for this clock are a clear indication that Amazon is allowing dishonest reviews by professional reviewers. To top it off, we discovered the clock is made in Commie China. Why would we want to reward this abusive government for their attrocious human rights and environmental behavior?? The same people who approved the massacre of tens of thousands innocent students in Tienamen Square are still running things, and if one has any doubt, just look at how they have raped Tibet. No more Seiko for us!"
2,It is NOT silent,"Specifically searched for a clock that is SILENT. This one ticks - despite the claim that it is silent. AND it cost me the $10 restocking fee to find that out. Seems a case of false advertising to me. If you are a sensitive sleeper and are looking for a non-ticking clock - do not buy this clock. It is a mild tick, but a tick nonetheless. Nothing else about this clock was redeeming enough to keep it."
5,Beautiful and matches the record player exactly,Easy to assemble and is an exact match for the Crosley record player.
1,Unengaging,"Cults interest me, but this novel failed to say, ""Look at me, read me and don't give up on me."" I have new time constraints, so I'm not going to sit around and wait for a book to get better. Oh, and I HATE how the author has used her middle initial - grrr. (DNF)"
1,Stopped working just after a month,Worked fine for a month. Tried using later and it just keeps on charging but as soon as it's unplugged it looses the charge.
2,blue crush 2,"It took about two weeks to get this movie.That's the longest I've ever had to wait to get something I had ordered from amazon.com.I don't know why it took so long ,but it did.I just got it a few days ago. I haven't had time to watch the movie yet ,but I've seen it already ,I just wanted to get a copy of it."
1,Turrible just turrible,"The girls were not hot enough to out do the awful plot,music(today is the greatest day? Worse song EVER), and acting. It was far too predictable and at time just strange. Do yourself a favor and pretend this movie never happened."
4,Cool Flick,"This is a real feel good movie,something the whole family can enjoy.The movie itself has nothing to do with the original Blue Crush,with the exceptions of the title and surfing.The movie revolves around Dana who leaves California and heads to South Africa to fulfill her mother's dream of surfing J-Bay.The production and acting exceed what you would expect from a direct to dvd release.Even though it is a bit cliche,i will again suggest this for a good family nite movie."
3,This isn't a bad movie,"Its terrible. The title implies that it is some extension of Blue Crush. It has nothing to do with Blue Crush and it wouldn't have been as bad if it hadn't ripped off the title. If they had called it something else, my expectations would not have been so high and I would have given it another star. Blue Crush was a really good movie. I have spent my life surfing. I have surfed everywhere except Australia. I can speak from experience ,everything about Blue Crush is believable. Blue Crush Two is just the opposite. It borders on corn ball. Save your money and spend it on your honey."
4,Badi's a HOTTIE!!!,"This girl can really play!! She's got loads of technique, and lots of soul. She effectively blurs the lines between contemporary classical composition and brazilian pop. Although she is primarily a guitarist, the vocal work on this album is also very nice. Get the disk!!"
2,very vanilla,"I am not impressed with this. She was hyped in the guitar magazines and I was expecting more. With the exception of the first song, this is pretty mundane and boring. An all guitar cd that is stripped down needs drama and passion. I do not get it."
5,Comedy Classic,"Think of this as a musical comedy created for the ear only. Freberg, who spent his formative years in radio, knew how to paint pictures in the listener's mind's eye, and rather skewed pictures at that. Here he's assisted and abetted by a cast that includes Jesse White (the original Maytag repairman) and June Foray (the voice of Rocky the squirrel) with big, brassy orchestrations arranged and conducted by Billy May. There's even a tap dancing credit! As for the comedy, it's hard to pick a favorite, though I'm partial to Tom Jefferson trying to convice Ben Franklin to ""sign on the dotted line"". Historically accurate, this album is not; hysterically accurate, absolutely."
3,Small and Compact But Missing Functionality,"As a user of the KB-11 keyboard I looked forward to using the KB-100. I was very pleased with the contruction and the size but less so with the decreased functionality. Where I could use keyboard commands almost exclusively on the KB-11 I now have to use the stylus for ""OK"", ""Done"", ""Cancel"", and almost every other command. I am sure that Sony will eventually offer an updated driver that will permit combination keys to activate these commends but in the meantime I am forced to keep a stylus in hand.The other negative factor is the location of the shift key but we humans will adapt to that."
5,Clie Super Accessory,The clie keyboard with my nx60 (or my nx70 and my sj22) really rounds out the product. The keyboard is of excellent quality and feel. With the keyboard I truly have a top notch laptop replacement. Clies are great but such accessories put them over the top!!
5,Sony CLIE PEGA-100 Keyboard,"I got my first Sony CLIE a long time ago. The input method was not bad, buy typing was faster. So I started looking for a keyboard. Found the Sony PEGA-100. Got one, used it for years. Recently the B and G keys stopped responding so got myself a replacement. People see it, and love it. Great for taking longer notes. I just hope my CLIE keeps working as I still like it and use it."
4,Escape from the Planet of the Apes,"A good movie and worth collecting. Real classic, good story line and help you to relate to the titles prior to this."
4,"THE BEST OF THE SEQUELS, BUT DON'T THINK ABOUT IT TOO LONG!","OK, None of the sequels measure up to the original, but this is the best of the sequels. It is done with some humor as it should be, because at this point the whole plot is skating on very thin ice! The movie is funny, tragically sad and interesting, just don't think about it too long afterwards. I am a fan of the series and I'm being generous with my rating. The DVD transfer looks great. If your a fan of the series you want them all!"
3,WELL...........,"This film does have it's funnier moments. The plot twist of Zira being pregnant drives us deeper into the maze that was first created in the first film. But, this film is not the best of the sequels, or the series. It just lacks the substance. The first two got you thinking, especially at the end, which I liked. The only time a brain is needed is with the twist ending. All in all, the film is pretty good on it's own, but not when you put it up to the original or the second one. I'd definately reccomend watching it, it's entertaining, but it just doesn't have the certain stuff that the first two have."
3,"Not the Best Acted, But Still Fun","This third installment of the Planet of the Apes movies is without a doubt fun, and an important segement in the five movies as the transition from the future world of the first two movies and the future world of the next two movies. At the same time, it is not the best acted movie in the world. Some of the actors are not convincing at all and deliver stale lines. In some sections you'll wonder if the director and writers weren't making up the movie as they went along. It's campy in some parts, but actually well-crafted in others. Nevertheless, Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter make the movie fun to watch and carry the story for their less-than-convincing supporting actors. Despite some of the ""shlockiness"" of the movie, I still enjoyed it. There is enough redeeming features of the movie to allow one to overlook some of its...well...shlock. So you'll roll your eyes from time to time; it's still a fun movie."
3,Poor Beginning but a good story nonetheless,"Once you get past the preposturous and serious flawed opening of the movie, you have a great story (in the first film we saw the damaged ship sink in the water. This film supposes that Cornelious and Zira somehow retrieved the ship and repaired it and were able to fly it back through time. All this was done in the short time from when Brent left their camp in the second film till he reached the mutant camp, which at most was a day). This was probably the best acting for Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter in the series. The movie makes us question the scientific use of animals in research."
5,NOT FOR CHILDREN. LIKE SOME PEOPLE THINK,"This installment in the POTA series is not as child friendly as some reviewers would have you believe. Despite the lighthearted scenes of Zira speaking for the first time to the unexpected, the presidential inquiry, and the apes tour of the city. This movie has a serious and sometimes grim tone with a sad and tragic ending that may upset some children. I would recommend that you watch this in it's entirety first before you decide if this is suitable for your children. There is no nudity or profanity, so it's safe in that respect. I saw this for the first time when I was roughly 13 years old and the ending traumatized me to no end. I may have been a little extra sensetive then, but to this day I can not forgive Eric Braeden. He played the part of Otto Hasslein too well."
3,A viewer,A pretty good PLANET OF THE APES sequel. The third best in the series. It has no suspense like the first two APES movies do. Not much action but the drama was good.

5,Hip and cool,A real cool book we have made almost all the stuff in the book it is fun to read and easy to make.
4,awesome book,jazz is awesome and so was this bookvery informative and was useful in writing myjazz paper
5,One of the best Jazz History books I've read.,"This book is one of those rare books that puts in a dilemma - you can't put it down on one hand, and you don't want to finish it to quickly because you enjoy it so much. I read dozens of Jazz history books, but this may be the one that taught me most (perhaps along with ""A power greater than itself"" by George Lewis). The bebop era is discussed from the social, economic and musical perspectives, with clarity and fluency that makes it a great reading experience. Highly recommended."
1,Made real cheep,I bought these at the beginning of the summer. 3 of the four plastic buckles have already broken. The last one broke before not long after that.
3,Didn't work in Canon photo printer,"Bought this for a Canon photo printer that advertises it takes ""all"" memory cards -- that is if you have the right adapter. This problem appears to be unique to Fuji and Olympus XD picture cards. Canon reps said to buy the Fuji adapter card for the Fuji XD picture card we use in our camera, but that still didn't work. I have received a refund from the store that sold me the printer and now I'll try to get my money back for the card. Lesson learned: if you plan to print from an XD picture card (Fuji or Olympus) make sure the XD picture card is compatible without having to use a $50 adapter (which by the way could add 50-80% more to your total cost)."
1,I did not receive what I bought,"I bought a XD to CF adapter, as per the picture on the page. Instead I received, as others did, a PMCIA adapter which is not what I wanted or needed. For the first time, I felt cheated by Amazon and don't know what to do. Hope to receive some explanation."
3,Item delivered was not as offered.,"The battery is being offered as ""Pearl Brlack"" but in fact it was delivered totally grey. The AD for this product should be corrected to become more precise."
4,Good product for experienced users...,"I had a difficult time getting it working. I gave up on it once and after a lot of frustration, I finally got it working. The key is tracking down the current drivers from the card manufacturer - who is not mentioned anywhere with the product and not looking at the instructions that came with the card.The driver CD software had basic problems that stopped it from being loaded in Vista. And, once you get the correct drivers, all of the old driver pieces had to be removed before the good software would work. I now know a lot more about this card than I ever wanted or needed to know..."
2,This card doesn't work with Windows 7.,"I couldn't get this to work with Windows 7. No matter what I tried it justwouldn't work. I had to return it. Instead I am going to convert my printercord to a usb plug to solve the problem using the printed with Windows 7.On Amazon it says this port card will work with Windows 7, but when thepackage arrived it didn't say anything about working with Windows 7."
4,"Works, but tweak settings","The drivers (both web page and from the CD) worked, but everytime I rebooted, my Asus PB5 Deluxe, XP SP3, blue screened when the HP 6L LaserJet (parallel) was polled. I had to use safe mode to disable driver before system would boot properly. I tried many settings. My final solution: once the driver is enabled, go to device manager, click on the Ports, then right click Parallel Port. In Properties, click Port Settings. Click on ""Use any interrupt assigned to the port"", don't select ""Enable Legacy Plug and Play Detection"". These settings worked for me."
5,Works great,"This PCI card does exactly what it says it does. I bought mine to connect my LaserJet4+ to my Dell which lacks a parallel port. When installed mine defaulted to LPT3, I assume to avoid conflicts with any factory ports. This card is very small and does not block airflow over a card above or below."
3,A bit overwhelming for the beginner,"This book, I suppose, is aimed at the beginner. It would probably be better suited as a companion to a sewing class, as it only seems to halfway explain things. Not a good choice for someone completely new to sewing, as I was when I purchased it several years ago. I found that, despite the glossy pictures (which were a little dated) a lot of my basic questions went unanswered, and much of the information was under the assumption that you already knew quite a bit about sewing already. I see now that this is out of print, and I only can hope the newer version has improved."
5,"The ""Extra"" Art History Textbook: A Writing Manual Roundup","""Art history textbooks are dry, encyclopedic, and non-controversial. They include every work of art except our favorites. We hear these complaints often, but nonetheless we use them. One way to spice up a course is to add extra readings. Some extras are practical references, such as writing manuals. Others cover theory or support specific assignments. This is the first in a series of posts on extra textbooks.""""For students struggling to finish well-structured essays during exams I recommend Sanford Kaye'sWriting under Pressure: The Quick Writing Process. It discusses the writing and grading of essay exams from both a student's and an instructor's viewpoint, which is insightful to both.""Excerpt from my blog entry The ""Extra"" Art History Textbook: A Writing Manual Roundup: http://arthistoriansatwork.blogspot.com/2008/12/extra-art-history-textbook-writing.html"
1,Definitely not as advertised,"This is a 3-page pamphlet giving a very brief description of the W.L. Gore lattice organization based Gore documents I had already seen, ending with an ad. I was expecting something more substantial by someone who knows the organization. 3 bucks isn't much, but why waste it."
2,Very interesting but gets long,"Michael's voice, as always, is astonishing. That's the good news. The bad news begins with the first number, ""When you Wish Upon a Star."" The song begins with a bunch of children crowding around a homeless man, who magically is transformed into an 18th century ringmaster (i.e., Crawford appears in his ""Barnum"" garb), while the street kids turn into circus acts. It gets better from there, going to more conventional scenes in theatres or recording sessions, but they do begin to run together after a while, and for those that know Michael, it's pretty much what you've seen on the In Concert TV special. Definitely worth it for Crawford fans, but for the quantity, not the quality."
2,Not age appropriate,I ordered this for a six year old and it is way to advanced for him. I thought by the description that it would have more pictures and be more to his age.Not sastisfied with this purchase.
1,ridiculous,"After reading only the first few pages of this book, I could see where it was headed, so I read no further. It's pretty clear that the author is an un-apologetic heliocentrist. In the introduction, he skips right over the fact that it has never been proved that the Earth revolves around the Sun.The idea that the Earth revolves around the Sun is a ridiculous theory which goes against all observable facts."
2,a rehash of the cry it out theme,"Babies and children cry for a reason, and is their first formof communication. Ignoring their cries teaches them that they aren'timportant and no one is going to care for their needs. Many desperate parents grab books like this, follow it, and have their hearts broken- in order to sleep. Babies arent' programmed to sleep through the night, something that Dr Ferber, a detached segment of our society and many non creative authors seem to have forgotten. Read ""Nighttime Parenting"" by William and Martha Sears, and their book on SIDS for a good understanding of sleep in babies and children."
1,Old outdated ideas,"This book was written in 1991 and I think the ideas even predate that era. Many old ideas that no longer are recommended, some are even dangerous (whiskey as a sleep inducer, letting baby sleep on tummy.) If you want a cry-it-out sleep book go to Ferber, if you want a non-crying plan go to Pantley (No-Cry Sleep Solution)"
5,ELECTRO ETHEREAL BEATS FROM OTHER WORLDS,"...and this final album by Mark Van Hoen's brillant band, Scala, continues to redefine the possibilites of avant-garde pop music.Much like the later Locust albums, Compass Heart reaches deep into the well of its imagination to deliver one exuberant final phase of this wildly creative dream-beat science. Sarah Peacock's heavenly vocals reign supreme, once again; and don't believe anyone who says that Seefeel was ever any better than this (because they were not.) Indeed, Scala is the perfect logical extension of those earlier ambient Seefeel albums, but this time concocted into a deliciously brazen brew of pop songwriting confections. Try Compass Heart with a set of good headphones, and you'll understand right aways why Scala remains the absolute electro-Led Zeppelin of the 1990's. This is soaring, wonderful electro-pop music at its edgiest and finest. As with all of the Scala albums, this one gets my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION."
2,Poor production quality,"I was disappointed that this book contains so many errors in its printed form. I am distantly related to the author and they even misspelled her name on the cover (her middle name was ERMINE, notERMINIE). One would at least expect the author's name to be right.There is a disclaimer in the front of the book saying that errors might occur because of the method of reproduction (which means little to us laymen), but I expected a more readable product."
2,Interesting as a historical slur,"By the time this book was first published, the organization of Bavarian Illuminati was kaput. Robinson, who had never been invited to join, and who held a grudge against all secret organizations, slammed the illuminati both in England, where it had not taken root, and in America, where it was unknown. However, his preaching against it raised the specter of conspriacy which still hangs over the illuminati, although it is very long gone. His book in interetsing as an example of sucessful ropaganda, nothing more."
1,What about Norwich University?,"The author of this book claims to be providing a comprehensive account of the great impact the state of Vermont had on the outcome of the American Civil War. Yet, the profound role that Norwich University (otherwise known as the Military College of Vermont) and its gallant alumni had in determining the course of this great historic event is given hardly any credence whatsoever. The fact that Norwich University is mentioned so very little in this book leads me to the conclusion that the authors research and scholarship is poor at best. So very sad!"
4,Great Sequel,"This is a great sequel to fairytale. Loved the writing, loved the characters, loved the story. Fairytale is free and this one is only .99 cents....well worth the money. Buy it and read it, you won't regret it."
5,Maggie Shayne ROCKS!,"All of Maggie Shayne books are awesome! I haven't found a bad one yet! I love her writing. Her ideas are truly wonderful and her characters are unique. As you read her novels, they take you to another world practically. Forever Enchanted is a must read for anyone who loves a good story!"
2,The first one was better,"*SPOILER ALERT*I read the first in this series and liked it but this one just had me shaking my head at how stupid this woman who suppose to be a ruler is. She does not trust her instincts. She is almost killed at least twice and saved by Tristen and when she is safe she try's to escape when she couldn't protect herself by herself so far. It seemed like if she is suppose to make important desitions for an entire kingdom she should be smarter and have some common sence. Turning herself over to someone who already tricked and lied to her once and tried to kill his own brother. Then seeing and hearing how evil he is and still thinking that he will keep his word or do anything helpful, sorry but,STUPID. Rulers it seems should come with some at least mildly intelligent plans.I really liked the first book in this series and Birdin seemed smart and resorceful. She just became stupid and spoiled in this one."
5,Delightful romance,"This was a very enjoyable, magical story. The characters are endearing, and the plot kept me interested. Recommended for all Shayne and paranormal romance fans."
1,Erotic Fantasy should be labled as such,"Good story marred by lusty, bodice ripping type descriptions...sheesh! Why can't they lable this stuff with a rating so you know what the heck you're getting into ?"
3,Forgettable,"I don't understand how and why this book received the awards it did. It's slow, dull, has too much going on in the plot, drags baptism and religion in as if these are resolutions, and is easily forgotten. I'm giving it three stars instead of two because Holt is a very good writer who, in my opinion, wrote something that doesn't work."
4,"Good book, but didn't deserve the award.","I read this book because my friend recommended it to me. At first it seemed like the plot of this book is pretty unique. Not many books have sideshow acts as main characters.In the beginning, Zachary Beaver comes to a small town in Texas for a few days. Soon, Toby, the main character, tries to befriend Zachary. They don't hit it off at first, but do after a couple chapters. I think there are many stereotypes in this book about some of the townspeople.It was a pretty good book because the main idea of the story is good, but it has no definite beginning, middle and end. You should read this book, if you want something to relax you and has a happy ending."
3,Good writing and a predictable story,"I heard this book won a big award today so I went right to thelibrary and read it! I think it is very well written. However, Ifound myself very far ahead of the story, so that I was not rushing to find out what happened next because I had already guessed what would happen next. I actually put it down to go read a magazine! I think this is a book that adults may like more kids in middle school like me. Oh well. But the writing was still good."
5,Does the job,Do not worry. This replacement battery works just as well as the Nikon product. I use them interchangeably and do not notice any difference.
1,The battery didn't last even a year,"I had been using this battery with my Nikon D70 camera since December, 2009. I am an occasional photographer. Initially, I was quite satisfied with the battery -- it used to hold over a hundred photos and long inactivity periods. When I tried to use it yesterday after a gap of about a month, I found it completely drained out and refusing to get charged. There was no way I could revive it. I am pretty upset that the battery didn't last for even a year."
5,Exactly what I expected.,"These were installed on a Chevy 3500 with a utility bed. They were a little long, so I trimmed them with a razor. Other than that, very easy to install. They have scaling on one side to keep the road junk from sticking to it. definitely a good deal for the money."
5,Please Come to Atlanta,"The universe is back in order. ""Out of the Blue"" was pretty good, but Chock Full... is vintage Aces. Russell's voice is magnificent, the quality of the recording itself is flawless and the songs - classic Aces. Buy it immediately, you'll not regret it. It brings back memories of the Aces performing at the Southeast Music Hall, 1979 in Atlanta, middle of June and the air conditioner broken. Combatting the heat by pouring pitchers of beer on our heads and in our mouths, it was one of the greatest shows I've ever seen. I sure hope they tour again and come to Atlanta"
3,chock full of country goodness,"I thought the lyrics were as interesting as anything Russell Smith has done in the past, but thought the production wasn't as good as some of the older albums."
2,The Foursome,I was hoping that the Foursome would match the Green but as luck would have it the sequel is never as good as the original.
2,This is a Hacker,"The boys and I loved the green - and were very disappointed after reading the Foursome.Do yourself a favor and skip this one if you love the ""Eddie"" mystique as much as we do..."
2,Pretty dated and pretty thin,"The author says he's writing from a neutral point of view, and just wrote this hack job on Delta after taking an honest look at the airline. He says he's sad he has to write such negative things about the airline. It doesn't seem like it. He seems to enjoy taking every slap he can.The problem is some of the logic is rather contorted. Also, the book is seriously out of date. Obviously, I bought it knowing it was old. But more than halfway into the book, you start hearing the same arguments over and over and it starts to wear pretty thin."
1,Who you gonna' call? Ghostbusters!!!,"I use this filter with a canon 17-40L. There is ghosting present with EVERY light source present in pretty much any environment. Just about all of my low light photos with this filter are un-usable. I plan on getting a multicoated B+W filter to correct this problem. Construction and fit are both mediocre, I don't recommend this filter!"
1,Didn't Fit Properly,"I just got the Sunpack 77mm UV lens and while it fits properly on my lens, the lens cap no longer sits correctly on the end of the lens. I almost have to force it to get it on. Disappointing to say the least. I will replace it with a Tiffen filter."
1,Disappointed,"After all the great reviews, I was optimistic this would be a great fit for my workout room. Unfortunately, unless I have my head in a specific spot in the room and don't move it, it has tons of static and I constantly lose the audio. Definitely not a good fit for working out."
1,Wireless,"I have been looking or wireless listeners for my father for a while now. So I found these at a great price, but all that shines is not gold. Horrible, I had to return them. I guess that when it comes to wireless technology one has to spend a bit more money. Like for the Sony ones..."
1,Incompatible with DVRs / TiVos / things with hard drives,"Seems like the spinning hard drive inside my TiVo interfered with the signal. In any case, there was perpetual loud static when in use that never let up, making it unusable. It probably says somewhere that hard drives interfere with it, but it would be nice if something was more explicitly written somewhere, like ""Does not work with DVRs.""""Unisar."" Guess I should have gone with a genuine Panaphonics, or a Magnetbox or Sorny.Anyway, I just gave it away to Goodwill."
4,"my prefered product, clear sound","excellent product, I bought one unit last year and after I bought two more. I can connect my Tv listener on one tv and after change a another MP3 device. I like it. clear sound.I recommend it"
4,Sounds good !,"Unit works best when transmitter is connected to audio outputs.An additonal plus would be, if the headset would have a female mini plug for more comfortable listening while in bed."
4,Good Product,This product works very well as long as there is a direct line of sight between the transmitter and the headphones. Works best if transmitter is at same height as your head. Overall I am pleased with the product and it has let my fiance work in peace while I am watching TV.
3,Tv listener,Very convenient if you don't wanna bother your partner or your roomates but you will have to be at the same height as the little receiver hooked to the tv but also facing it straight. Not so convenient if you're trying to sleep... Overall not that bad but it you end up falling asleep and getting into the wrong position the static will wake you up...
2,Great for a short while,"This worked great for about 6 weeks...then totally quit. I am disappointed in it and would not buy another one. I used good batteries and kept them fully charged. The last week or so of use, it started getting static-y and then I would have to tap on it to get it to work, and now it just quit totally. I do not recommend it."
4,Unisar Sounds TV Listener,Works very well. My husband has hearing problems and we no longer have to share our viewing choices with the neighbors! Family members can speak to each other while we are watching and both hear each other and not make it impossible for my husband to understand what's happening on the show he's watching. The TV is at a normal sound level.The only challenge was getting the sender high up enough so that someone passing in front of it doesn't break the sound and cause feed back in the head set. Once that was accomplished with some velcro it's all good!
2,Worthless when working out,"In the best of circumstances, it works. But the need to maintain a fragile line-of-sight between headphone and transmitter is dicey, at best. Worse for me is that as soon as I powered on my treadmill, the headphones erupted with interference static, rendering them useless for the very activity I bought them for."
2,would not recommend...,"We had two of these for kids to watch TV. Unless you were positioned a certain way right in front of the base unit, you would get static. Not fun when you are trying to enjoy a movie. Luckily, they got zapped by lightning and we purchased the Rocketfish headphones. WAY better; you can go through the entire house and still hear what's on TV crystal clear."
1,"Not Impressed, does not work","One downfall to the product is the TV volume has to be on to use the headphones making it impossible for your partner to sleep in the same room that the TV is in. If the person is already hard of hearing the volume must be turned up considerably to be able to hear through the headset, which defeats the whole purpose of using them. A lot of Hiss noise in headset as well also making it hard to hear."
4,Unisar Sounds Headphones,These headphones work great for listening to TV. But they do not work for the purpose I got them for. I wanted a pair of headphones to use while I run on my treadmill. When I get on the treadmill all I get is static.Does anyone know of an inexpensive headphone that I can use while walking/running on a treadmill???????
4,Wireless Headphones,"Light weight, comfortable, excellent clear sound, good range of sound level adjustment, not total sound isolation. Easy to install on TV. Got two sets; for two TV's."
1,Alot of interference,"Terrible, Receives radio stations through headsets even with transmitter off and back inside packaging. When it was transmitting the sound was very garbled and line of sight ended at 3 feet."
3,Not Bad Sounding But Overpriced,"While these headphones have decent sound quality, there can be great radio interference and static. Turning up the source volume, while turning down that on the headphones may drown out the extra noise, but there's the additional problem of maintaining a good signal. Walking about the room or even turning one's head can disrupt it, especially if the batteries aren't fresh. Moreover, the earpads are thin and uncomfortable for an isolation headset."
4,works fine,"Works fine right out of the box. Not really built for abuse, but the price is right, and it works just fine."
2,waste of money,I was dissapointed with this purchase. There was a constant static in the background which made listening uncomfortable for me
1,ABSOLUTE RUBBISH,"I bought this piece of s..t about six months ago and the sound was not clear even the very first time I used it, but it came in one of those plastic boxes that you just have to tear apart in order to pull out the cheap stuff inside, so I never bothered to return it, but I did promise myself that I will let everyone know what a piece of s..t these headphones are!!!"
3,Not compatible with plasma TV,"We had to return this because it is not compatible with plasma TV's. We will give it a neutral rating, and warn anyone else who is fixing to make the same error. We are kind of surprised that a headphone that is supposedly TV-oriented, would have this technology gottcha."
2,Buy TV EARS instead - Don't waste your money on these,I had these for three months and both the headset that came with and the extra headset I purchased had stopped working. Not to mention that these I had to replace the batteries every week. No charger option. You had to be perfectly aligned with the main unit at all times. Lots of regular static when out of direct line. this means if your slouching on the couch instead of sitting up.Get the TV Ears instead. they are more expensive but are so much better in reception. I can go anywhere in the room. They sit in a base when not in use and recharge. No need for batteries. You can buy at Costco for $4p (best deal anywhere).
4,Bebe Sounds TV Listener,"The TV Listener works pretty good. Some sound does have to be on the TV for it to work, however. I wanted it for late night TV watching so I wouldn't disturb the rest of the house and it works for that."
4,Unisar Sounds,"It works fine and is reasonably priced, in fact lots less than a couple of similar products we found locally. You do get shshsh sound if you're a certain angle to the right or left of where the device sits on your TV (I'd say roughly 45 degrees to either side)."
4,Good product,"I've used this headset for a couple of months and find it to be a good set. A bit pricey and not all that adjustable. Head pressure of the ear pieces is uncomfortable over an extended period. Its ""line of sight"" operational, so leaving the area of the connection piece can be a hassle. Takes two batteries in the head piece to operate and can last for several days use. I can watch TV without disturbing anyone in the house. I am looking into a different, more expensive, headset that's more comfortable and adjustable to use. I would recommend this headset for children's use rather than adults use."
1,not good example of product,Headset did not work one ear at a time worked - must have been faulty. Also wanted to use while on treadmill. With just one ear working - treadmill caused too much static to hear anything. Returned product.
4,Great Product - Buy Two!,"After years of not being able to understand some TV broadcasts due to the new processes they use, I'm finally able to understand what is being said. My hearing isn't all that bad, but the audio on some telecasts is very hard to understand even w/ the volume turned up. Being able to watch TV in bed w/o disturbing my wife is a big plus and one of the main reasons we purchased the headsets. One thing I found, it is more economical to purchase (2) complete systems, rather than buying an extra set of headsets. The cost is about the same and it gives you another receiver to attach to another TV or stereo. The only negative thing I've found is the covering on the phones could be a little more comfortable. I wear a large hat size. So for others, it is probably more comfortable. In any event, a good value for the money."
1,JUNK! Amplifies EVERY sound in the room!!,"I bought this gadget to help me better hear my programs over my husbands incessant snoring. The way this product works is by attaching a transmitter clip right next to the TV's speakers! Hello!!?? It does NOT plug into the TV anywhere. This creates a problem for me in these ways:Also amplifies snoring, right through the headset.Also amplifies baby monitor buzz.Also amplifies heater/air conditioning sounds.Amplifies ALL sounds in the room, direct through the headset.So, as you can see, all these sounds overcome the TV sound.This product is great if you want to amplify snoring.I tried w/o hubby in the room at all, and was still extremely dissappointed! Save your $$ and buy a better unit. This thing is not worth $2.oo!"
2,Works so-so,"Well, it kinda works, but unless you are sitting DIRECTLY in line with the receiver it cuts out. Not only that, but if you move the slightest bid it starts getting staticky and annoying. Even when you find the perfect spot, if the volume isn't up high enough to drown out the static then you will hear the annoying, vibrating static. It's a difficult sound to describe but ""annoying"" pretty much covers it.I don't recommend this system. If your TV has a headphone jack, I recommend you just get a 25' extender cord for $10 and plug in a set of good headphones. That way you can sit or lay however you want and not have static fluttering in your ear."
3,functional,"I am pleased with this item, but it doesn't allow you to leave it plugged into your tv and just turn it on. You have to plug it in AND turn it on, then turn it off AND unplug it - each time. That seems a waste of my time, and could have been avoided. There is a short horizontal space for you to move without losing sound, but it works fine."
5,good stuff,"Product works great, even using the microphone(no audio output jack on my TV). Sound quality is actually better than the normal acoustics. Plus I can pretend not to hear what my spouse is saying to me when convenient!"
4,Absolutely love it!!,"Well I needed this since I get major insomnia while living in an apartment, plus I like my TV loud. I have had this for 3 years and it's still going strong, trying to find new ear covers but the sound is clear.Pros - Fit's on the ear, clear voice quality- Wireless- Easy to set up- Comfortable fit for me- Price at the time I paid lessCons - Some times I pick up radio programs- Batteries use it a lot so I went to rechargeable batteries.(I think my model is only uses 2 AA batteries)It's great to watch action movies with a lot of sound, or music videos or music performances. I absolutely love it I am surprised to still have it working great going on 3 years of use. The spongy ear covers went before the unit did. for the price, the convenience to my neighbors also to watch movies, TV shows with theater like quality in the privacy of my home I love it!"
4,good for the new suspect for the old,I purchased these for my 87 year old mother with hearing difficulties. She has a new t.v. in the living room and an old one (minus plug in port). The unit was easy and quality to use on the new but she could not (and several friends) figure out how to use it on her older set.
1,Buy different wireless headphones,"Here's the scoop on this product: It only works up to about 8 feet and the line between the headphones and the base has to be a STRAIGHT line on the SAME PLANE. So, for example, I wanted to use this while I was on the treadmill. I had to jimmy up the base onto the top of a corkboard (don't ask) so that it would be in direct line with the height of the headphones when I was on the treadmill. It would not work if the base was even an inch above or below the height of the headphones. I only bought infrared because my modem has had problems with interference from 900mHz phones and I didn't want to take the chance with the headphones. But there has GOT to be better infrared products out there than this. If you can achieve a straight line between the base and headphones (with nothing in between the phone and base), than, yes, the sound is fine."
2,Great Item--If It Were Dependable,"My husband thoughtfully purchased the Unisar Sounds TV Listener for my birthday. I enjoy exercising early in the morning, and now I can watch TV/DVDs without disturbing the rest of the family. The headphones are comfortable, easy to use, but unfortunately worked well for only a week. The left speaker works about half the time and either hisses or goes silent when not receiving the proper sound signal. I'd return them for another pair, if I still had the box and return label. It's a great concept, and I know I'd enjoy this product if it were dependable. So my advice to others who may purchase this item--keep the box and return label."
2,Unisar sounds terrible,"When I first started using the TV listener, it worked reasonably well but did have a pronounced swishing sound in the background. After a few weeks, however, I could hear more static than sound. I have tested the cable connections to make sure they were tight, have fiddled with the relative volume adjustments on the headsets and TV, and tried repositioning the transmitter. All without much success. I still use it in a pinch, but only when necessary. Perhaps the batteries, which are almost brand new, need replacing. Overall, I am not happy."
1,terrible product,Headphones are extremely uncomfortable and there is lots of static whenever you are near an electrical object.
4,It's an OK buy,"The product is fine, it works pretty good.The only thing I don't like the batteries don't last long at all."
2,Very disappointed,"They work for me, but just barely. They have a very limited range, about 12 feet for me. If I walk to the kitchen, which has a clear line of sight to the T.V., I lose all sound at 15 feet. I will most likely use them for a while and get a better quality headphone set. They are not very comfortable. I strongly suggest spending a bit more for something of quality.THIS IS AN EDITED REVIEW OF PRODUCT: I TOSSED THE HEADPHONES OUT! THEY ARE TERRIBLE. I GIVE IT A Z E R O 0. I AM NOW HEARING A RADIO STATION ALONG WITH THE POOR QUALITY SOUND THE HEADPHONES DELIVER WITH MY TELEVISION. Get a quality headset..NOT THIS PRODUCT!"
5,Fantastic Product,You won't be disappointed if you purchase this product. When our air or furnace are running it gives us some problem hearing the TV. The headphones are great and prevent us from missing anything. Also if the TV is bothering someone else in the household you can listen to your show and not disturb the other person.
3,TV Listener,The volume needs to be higher.I put it at it's maximum and that seemed to not be enough.
2,TV listener,"I got this for my sister who is in rehab. The room mate is hard of hearing, has the volume up has much as she can. This doesn't allow my sister to enjoy her own sounds. The Unisar still picked up the room mates TV over my sisters."
2,Not for the faint of heart! :),The reason I did not like this item is because it doesn't work with a Flat Screen Plasma TV. To much interference and low sound quality. Also had to hold head a certain way in order to get any meaningful sound out of it. I went with an LR unit and it works beautifully. It arrived on time and quality of the item was fine but couldn't use it with my TV so I returned it. I hope this helps
3,Headphone quality leaves a lot to be desired.,"The device works well overall but is sometimes annoying when moving slightly and direct line-of-sight to the TV transmitter is lost and therefore the sound. The foam pads on the headset are very thin and tear easily. After about a year the foam pads are completely worthless and the listener is forced to use them with the ear exposed to bare metal; VERY uncomfortable. An upgrade of the headsets is definitly in order. Additionally, I think the headsets eat batteries for lunch. Buy a large supply of AAA batteries before purchase as the headsets require a lot of changing to feed the appetite! This system is priced very favorably compared to others on the market but the old adage of ""you get what you pay for"" is apropos in this instance."
4,Listener works great,Great for me and as well as my husband when he goes to sleep I can watch tv all night and sleep during the day as I do... While he goes to work. He can sleep with out being disturbed..
3,Early 90's metal,"Looking for videos with old favorites in them can prove fun. Features on Poisen, Pretty Boy Floyd, Slaughter, Doro, Whitesnake and more. Spandex on pretty girls and not so pretty guys."
4,Laverne Butler,"I have several CDs by Laverne Butler and I love them all. Although I believe this is one of her earlier works, it is just as good as the later works. She is a true talent."
5,Great First Addition to Mother Goose,"My son received this book on his first birthday and has enjoyed it so much! His favorite is ""Jack be Nimble, Jack be Quick."" He enjoys looking at the pictures by himself and I don't have to worry about him ripping the pages! The illustrations are adorable and they have a vintage quality to them. It is nice that other skin colors are represented as well. I'd highly recommend this version of some Mother Goose."
3,too small,i bought this asa gift for my nephew. It was a lot smaller than i thought. I have intentions to buy a larger version in the future. however my nephew still enjoys playing with it
5,very good product,It is a very good product because it really relives pain.Also you recieve a generous amount of product and it last quite long.
4,Migrate to Customer Experience,"Essential input on why CRM, customer advocacy, satisfaction, retention, and relationship marketing programs need to migrate to Customer Experience Management as the holistic method of achieving customer-centricity. The one thing I'd like to see more of in this book is B2B examples. Quick read and great overview of what CEM really is, and lots of examples provided. For a quick read on driving progress of customer programs I also recommend this book with step-by-step tips:Metrics You Can Manage For SuccessandCustomer Experience Improvement Momentum."
2,Not what I expected,I was hoping for a useful framework. What I got was more about the author's consulting experiences and an academic approach to the framework vs. something practical.
5,Caribe,"spanish book, about Caribbean food, going country per country. Not fool on recipies, but very well explained."
4,dreamin the dream,I love to do these type of PBN projects except I use gel pens and they turn out beautiful I started doing them when I was diagnosed with cancer and was stuck in bed for awhile and needed something to do not good with a paint brush so my sister said use all those gel pens we got you so I matched them best I could and I have been going ever since the more detailed the picture the better it looks and this moonlit cabin is my all time favorite byfar....
4,Nice painting,"It is a very pretty paint by numbers, and it arrived quickly after ordering. However, they should include an extra brush with it, and we ended up using colored pencils on a small section of it, for detail. Overall, good product, and would recommend."
3,Suited my purpose,I've completed several paint-by-numbers and this one was a bit more challenging than several I've done. It was just what I wanted to keep my hands busy while I was off work for the summer. However the paints are of poor quality and the end product still looks like a paint-by-numbers so it's not something I would ever display.
3,Want to work in a zoo?,"I want to be a Zookeeper is a really basic look at what zookeepers do. It is more of a wouldn't it be neat to play with and take care of all the cool animals every day than a career preparation book. No mention is made of what requirements there are to getting a job in a zoo like get a MS in Zoology. Some photos are good but at least one looks dated. Some of the text isn't really related to the topic. For example, ""Penguins are from a very cold place, but they feel at home in the snow."" At least the photo shows a zookeeper and her assistant checking out the penguins. I do think it is good for children to read books like this so that they consider occupations that they might not have thought about considering. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
1,Dead On Arrival!!,"The price was right, but of course there is always a catch! In this case, the catch was that the battery had been sitting on a shelf somewhere for 8 yrs!!!, as indicated by a sticker on the plastic, and was DOA when I got it. I cannot believe that they would sell an 8 year old battery! Obviously the battery lost it's charge years ago, and this whole order wasted my time!!!"
5,Gold Needles,"For embroidery, it's important to have a good quality needle, that will not break in the middle of a project. I have been very happy with this selection and have nothing, but great results with my hobby of embroidery!"
5,I love it!,"Hello I'm Jess. I just received this item today and I love it! It's just so cute and morbid at the same time and it's soft to the touch as well. As a teenage female I realized I may be a bit biased but it doesn't matter, I consider this backpack a good purchase for anyone who loves similar things. It's a bit small to use as a school bag but seriously, what girl doesn't have a cute but useless purse or more? It holds most stuff you need. 5 stars."
4,Skelanimals Kit (Cat) Backpack,"I absolutely love it, only draw back small pouch inside. Could've maximized spaced better to fit more, other than that no complaints. Cute that the skeleton part glows in the dark."
4,Super durable awesome bag,"This is a pretty cool & older, so kinda rare, bag but for me this has sentimental value through the roof. However, from a more objective point of view, this bag has ample space inside, cutesy but not too childish, and lasts for at least four years in counting through day to day wear and tear."
3,"Decent price, but not as good as the Canon battery","I picked up a couple of these batteries as spares for my Canon digital camera (Powershot G5)--for the price of a single Canon battery.Both have worked fairly well, although neither holds nearly the charge of the Canon batteries; I expect to get about 50 photos off of one, using a flash for about half, whereas the genuine Canon battery is good for 100 or more.Also, one of the two no longer charges in external chargers; the contacts on the battery apparently don't quite connect well enough. I have to change that one in the camera.Overall, if you want a spare battery, you can get two of these for what one Canon battery costs--but expect to get half the performance of the Canon battery, too."
1,Junk battery!,"Beware of this product. Bought one, worked great.. for about a month. It's now dead, will not take a charge, and sits inert. Classic reason to stay away from knock-off cheap junk."
1,Don't buy this battery,I bought this battery as a replacement for an old Canon BP511A. It lasted about a couple of months before it started not taking a charge. Complete waste of money.
4,Great battery,"Ive had it for a couple months now. I notice no difference between it and my canon bp511. My only gripe with it is its cheazy silver plastic color, but hey, who looks at your batteries?"
4,Solid battery,"This lasts as long as my Opteka brand battery that I have already, no issues with it heating up or being unreliable, but I don't use it intensely as it is mostly a backup."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this battery (my second Lenmar product that failed prematurely) five months ago and have used it three times. It is now dead and unuseable. I explored the warranty option, but Lenmar wants $7.95 for processing. Save your energy for other things and never buy Lenmar."
3,NOT for young boys!,"I probably should have read more of this book myself before giving it to my 12 year old to read. My son races motocross and struggles to read. I figured a topic that he's passionate about might work. It did, but this book really wasn't appropriate for his age. The swear words didn't bother me so much (though they might for some parents) but when my son tells me that one character's girl friend is pregnant (but luckily she just graduated from high school he says!!!) and tells me another one is smarter because he used a condom, I about fell out of my chair. Sure, it's all reality but not necessarily what you want a younger kid reading.We read Motocross Mike last year and really enjoyed it. I was hoping for something similar but this is definitely meant for a more mature teen audience. The story is holding his attention (no doubt since it's full of the ""forbidden""!!) but some of the side topics could have been toned down some to appeal to a slightly wider audience."
1,Disappointing drivel,"I was really hoping for a better read. Even in the hands of a betterwriter this story would fall flat - It is predictable and hum drum. If you need something to help you fall asleep quickly, buy a used copy. Very disappointing."
4,Motivational,Great book to use in your classroom to motivate reluctant readers. I bought several books to add to my library that might motivate the boys during D.E.A.R. time. this was a popular choice.
1,Rubbish for the humour-challenged,"This is simply a huge dungeon with so-called ""hilarious"" levels in it. Have fun fighting Col. Sanders, one-horned ducks, Dr Who and other ""hilarious"" stuff. I have no idea why T$R published this."
2,When Pappy goes Hunting,"I purchased this book as used because it was supposed to be in very good condition. Instead, it arrived and not only was inscribed with ink on the first page, but had markings from aged tape that had dried and decomposed. At best it might have been fair condition in my mind."
2,Blah!,"If you want a good plot that won't let you put the book down, look elswhere. Throughout ""The Losers"" it appears that David Eddings is continually looking for places to insert his own personal philosophy on the social system. The title refers to those who begin to greedily rely on social handouts, giving up all hope and ambition for their lives--simply living for the next welfare check. The description makes it sound like there would be a supernatural/fantastical element to the story, but there is none whatsoever. I'm not surprised they tried to cover up the real plot though, because I doubt there is much of a market for fiction about social welfare.Go read something else unless you need to know what David Eddings thinks about the social welfare system...."
2,The truth of reality...,"This book, which none will dispute, to be outside of Eddings's usual endeavors is a hit nonetheless. Set in today's society it shows us the grim reality of the social support program and the curse of the ""women who don't know how to type""(not meant as a sexist remark). With some lacings of satire where appropriate and drenched in the harsh reality that many are forced to live with. It provides a wakeup call to main stream society about the problems beyond the begger on the street or the coupon guy at the grocery digging in the basket of dented cans and expired goods. If this book dosen't open your heart then the only way would be to go and live their(the loosers) life. A must read!"
2,The Losers by David Eddings,"Like ""High Hunt"" not too great of a book. I finished it but it was a struggle. Lucky for me I bought it second hand! You like something exiting to read, then get:""The Belgariad""; ""The Malloreon""; ""Elenium"", and ""Tamuli""!!!!! All excellent books!!!!"
4,RAD,"Well it is pretty simple, the title of the album is ""Something Beautiful"" and that is what the album is, beautiful. Her voice, I really enjoy. Though most, if not all the songs are covers, she does a wonderful job, and does justice to the origional artists. I really enjoy this album, and I reccommend it to others looking for a beautuful female voice to relax to."
1,Scent does not last....,I sprayed some of this on my pulse points and the scent didnt even last for an hour! This was totally not worth the price.
1,Unhappy Angel,I purchased Angel fragrance recently and I'm very disappointed. Obviously the bottle is old. It smells like it has been sitting on a hot shelf for years. I didn't check the return policy before I ordered and of course Amazon will not allow me to return it. DON'T buy fragrance from Amazon unless you want to get stuck with old perfume that smells bad. I will never buy fragrance from Amazon again.
2,NOT a filter adapter,"52mm filters will NOT thread into this adapter, even though Amazon shows a filter kit that supposedly is commonly sold along with it."
2,online poster looks better than in person,I ordered this poster based off the picture online and am sorely dissapointed. The poster I received is dull and the colors are blended into vague grays and navy blues. :( VERY DISSAPOINTED. The photo online is gorgeous with distinct features. Not so with the poster.
4,Complainers still listen to their 8 track tapes,"A new format is a good thing. If you dont like change then dont use it. There is no reason to complain. This is a fine way to store pictures, and there is nothing wrong with technological advancement. Good products live on (mostly) and bad ones go away.The xD is smaller and faster, and has more potential in the long run. If a better one comes along, so be it. It seems to be reliable in terms of storing memory. Isnt that the most important thing?"
5,Right on time w/ lots of picture storage!,This memory card was great it held a great amount of pictures (100 to be exact) for the concert I was going to. I would recommend it to any and everyone I know.
3,As Basic As It Gets,"It doesn't get more basic than this for an off camera flash bracket, but then the design's been around for decades. Quality is OK but nothing to get excited about: The flash shoe is ""impact bonded"" in the 3 spots where the old ones used screws, so not sure how well it'll hold up. It's fine for the price & does the job."
2,spend a little more on a better bracket,"It works more or less as intended. The weight of a speedlight can be too much to handle and the bracket slips pivoting on the camera. Besides, mine came with a damaged thread. So I would recommend spending a little bit more and buying a better quality bracket."
2,Poor quality,"In addition to the unbelievable noise mentioned by many reviewers, my grinder is extremely fussy. It stops in the middle of grinding, for no apparent reason, and it takes several attempts to get it started again. At times it won't power on at all, and the only remedy is to unplug it and wait fifteen minutes or so--not exactly convenient when you're trying to make your morning coffee.On the plus side, it is affordable, and when it works properly, it produces a very fine grind that is ideally suited for my coffee maker. But I wouldn't purchase it again if I had the opportunity, and I can't recommend it to anyone else."
2,"While it worked, I liked it...but now it's dead","For the price, this WAS one heck of a deal for the quality of grind you can get from this device. Those that complain of the noise levels, maybe haven't experienced a burr grinder before. Even commercial ones are pretty loud. I had no complaints until this morning discovered that it would not power on at all. No lights, nothing. Bummer! I've used this for right at 1-1/2 weeks before it died. I don't recommend it but I gave it 2 stars instead of one because I liked it while it worked as it was easy to operate, did (past tense) what it supposed to, and looks fairly nice. Spend the extra and get a longer lasting one than this and save yourself the hassle."
3,ok for the price,"The noise will most likely wake up your partner, so grind the night before. Also won't grind a fine for use in Turkish coffee. It barely does a job for espresso grind. But the price is right."
2,not quite good enough,"didn't want to spend more money than necessary to get going in espresso making world, so this looked promising. can't argue with the price, it is well made and product info leads you to believe they support their products. but, the finest grind it does is twice the size of the pre-ground Sega Fredo and Lavazza I like, so it does require a very solid tamp, or a pressure creating filter head to draw good shots with the grind from this unit. don't know if there is a grind size rating, but I would call this ""coarse"" compared to the fore mentioned."
1,I regret buying this $50 coffee grinder,"This $50.00 coffee grinder clogs up where the grounds come out. The plastic ground coffee receptacle is difficult to use because the top is not connected, so the top falls into the container, it falls off, etc. It is too high maintenance for my taste. I never used a burr grinder before and will never use one again. I bought this for our office use and want to return it for one that just grinds the coffee."
5,Great grinder for the price!,"I was looking for a relatively low priced burr grinder to replace my blade grinder when I stumbled upon this one. I was hesitant about purchasing a grinder with no reviews, but took my chances and I am glad I did. It has 16 different grind settings, it just took a little experimenting to get the one I like. I can really taste the difference in my coffee! Definitely worth the money!"
2,Broken after 2 years,"After owning this for two years, the grinder no longer works. The interlock which enables the grinder to operate when the receiving container is in place has failed. Also, the storage area from which the beans are drawn has broken off the grinder."
1,Broke after 3 uses.,"Purchased this grinder for my husband as a gift. I can't review how well it worked because I don't myself drink coffee. However, like some other reviewers I can tell you that the grinding mechanism broke after 3 uses. It is inexpensive for a Burr grinder but perhaps not particularly durable and ultimately not the best product."
3,pretty good; required modification,"I bought this for $30, and at that price I'm glad I did. Two flaws: first, sometimes beans cease to feed properly from the bean feeder, making it necessary to shake the unit to get the flow going again. Second, with repeated use the unit will sometimes shake the reservoir slightly loose while grinding; this engages a safety switch and stops the half-finished grind. Very irritating! I disassembled the unit and shorted the safety switch so as to make it nonfunctional, and have been pleased with the results (although I can now accidentally spew coffee all over my kitchen if I stupidly press start when the reservoir isn't in place.All in all a pretty good unit, but not something I'd pay $50 for."
1,high Hopes Dashed,"I purchased the Ariete Burr Coffee Grinder 45800 to step up from the old grinder I had been using for years. While it worked wonderfully for a while, the motor froze after just one year, rendering this product useless. Good concept, poor execution."
3,Ok for the money,"My grinder lasted 4 years with some intermittent problems, but I only paid $30 for it. Like others the buttons break and it plugs up, but the motor finally died. Not sure i will replace at the higher cost, might look for something better."
3,Wake Up!,This coffee grinder does a nice job grinding the beans but it is very loud! I like that it holds a nice amount of beans in storage.
3,Broken part,After the first few times I used the grinder whic is wonderful the plastic groung coffee cather's bottom fell out and I do not knoe how to get a replacement so it is pretty much useless
3,"Not bad, not great","The grinder grinds well. It is much better than a blade grinder and I enjoy being able to choose the amount of grind and the grind size and not having to monitor the grinder while it does it's job. However, it is very noisy and the discharge compartment is not easy to pull out because it is smooth and flush with the body of the grinder. There is no handle to pull on. Also, the bottom of the discharge compartment is a seperate piece that can fall off if you tap the container to dislodge the fine grinds that collect on the front. I suppose that is what the brush is for, but a quick tap on the counter is easier, although I have had to glue the bottome back on."
3,Worked great for 2 months,"This was a great grinder while it worked. I really loved its settings, it measured and grinded perfectly. Unfortunately, the switch failed after two months."
1,coffee maker,Beware - order this combo and . . ??? I ordered the coffee maker July 4th and still have not received it !!
1,Not worth the money,"This coffee grinder is a piece of junk. There were more grounds scattered all over my counter than in the little cup holder. Then after awhile, I had to take a butter knife and clean out the little hole where the grounds came out because it became clogged and stopped running. The feature of selecting amount of grounds to grind and kind of grind was nice, but for a household that drinks a lot of coffee, this grinder is NOT the one to have."
3,Not Quite Worth It!,"I have owned this machine for two years. Now when I purchased it the price was $30 but now its $50. but its the same machine. Don't get me wrong it is functional but there are some problems: First there is a lot of static electircity which makes you constantly have to clean it and it does get messy. Also, and heres the most annoying part, it gets clogged very week. This means that each week I have to take it apart and clean out the clog, clean up the subsequent mess, and then put it back together again. And then it is loud but for the minute or so that its, so what.Now for $30, the hassles are excusable but $50...........its the same model and probably with the same problems. My advice..........spend a little more and get something better!"
4,Great grinder for the price,"Bought it about a year ago and have had no problems yet. It does tend to grind a little less than the amount of cups you set it at when the hopper is running low on beans, but that's nort uncommon with gravity fed hoppers. Quality of grind is good for french press, drip. I've used it in my espresso machine and it tasted fine, but i'm no coffee guru, so take that last bit with a cube of sugar...."
2,Lots of trouble,"This is a pretty grinder, and it does grind beans well. However; this grinder has been more trouble than any I have had before. We have to take it apart often to unclog the shoots... Often it will spin and spin but the beans can reach the blades... the shoot to allow the grinds into the box will clog. We have to take it apart about once every other week and I have never had that problem with grinders in the past. Very disappointing."
2,TOO LOUD . . .,"I have owned several coffee grinders over the years. I was attracted to this model because of the style and price.The first Lello Ariete grinder arrived D.O.A.The replacement grinder did a decent job of grinding the coffee beans for my auto drip coffee maker, but with issues. It was much too noisy - like a saw mill. There was no corner of the house where one could escaped the noise. The neighbors probably though I was remodeling the kitchen. It was returned immediately.I am still looking for a decent conical burr grinder."
1,May be I've got not a good instance....,"Reviews are really not bad on this item, so I've decided to give a shot with solely purpose in mind - grind it really fine, for Espresso machine and Turkish coffee pots.From this point of view I can't make it work even now. With the finest possible setting it still gives a lot of coerce particles, I mean really big crunches good for coffee press at best case only. Removing been pot, cleaning burr and reinstalling it again does not help. So basically it does not do what it was bought for.Good points are:- it's beautiful, really not so big as you see it on pictures, elegant and stylish- it's not so loud especially when you consider it's speed - 5 seconds of noise doesn't make difference for most of usMight be I've got defected item, but overall impression is spoiled."
2,Disappointed,"I owned a Braun grinder for 10 years and decided to replace it. After reading all the reviews extensively, which contained some conflicting information, I selected this Lello Ariete model. Unfortunately most of the negative comments turned out to be correct. My belief now is that $40-50 is simply too little to pay for a grinder and expect great quality and functionality.Specifically the problems were:- Product is indeed very LOUD much to my family's chagrin each morning. Similar to a gas lawn mower in volume...probably 100-110 decibels.- The unit died after one month. Bad connection in the plug.- There is significant static electricity in the hopper.- The hopper is odd shaped and hard to clean.- A nonsensical set of buttons & lights that control how much to grind.I just purchased the Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder to hopefully reach a better tier in grinders. I'm paying hundreds per year in coffee, so why not invest in better quality."
4,Good and loud,"So far I like this machine. It grinds well and fairly consistently. It is, however by far the noisiest contraption in the house. It sounds more like it's grinding rocks than coffee. Maybe it has to do with the morning quiet, but it's LOUD. So I walk into the room, fire it up and leave while it does it's thing. Not a problem with static like the Krups grinder it replaced. All in all I'm happy with this grinder."
4,cool little gizmo,"I bought this with the coffee maker I recently reviewed. I like it because it is like set it and forget it. Get up, push the button while filling the water and your good to go. Does make quite a a bit of noise but that's the way it goes. I find it more uniformed grind than the spice mill blade type grinder and it is easy to change the grind when I perk coffee."
4,5 years and going...,"Bought this in May of 2006.Been working great, but you do have to clean out the coffee chute once in a while (I may have done it 3 times in 5 years).Good enough for Espresso Pot makers, which need slightly coarser grind, not good enough to make Turkish Coffee, which needs super-fine grind.I do pour out all the ground coffee into an old coffee can, as the bin is inconvenient to use with spoons."
2,"Decent grind, poor design and materials","Pro: The grinding mechanism itself produces a consistent grind.Con 1: The feeding mechanism jams up with grounds, which cannot just be brushed out. You have to shove a long, thin object up into the hopper to scrape them out. This actually may be the problem for those who mentioned it broke after several uses -- it may have just needed cleaning.Con 2: The basket is just a tad too wide for smaller hands to be able to pull it off the machine very easily. Maybe some type of notch to pull it out would work better?Caveat 1: The hopper tends to spray the grounds out, rather than downward, so they hit the lid of the basket. When the lid is removed, the grounds spill out. Spillage seems to be a common issue in grinders, though.Caveat 2: The brittle plastic pieces don't seem to be replaceable.Overall, not a great value for the price point, considering its relatively short lifespan."
3,Satisfactory,"We wanted a good bible based game to play with our youth group and this was a great choice! It flexes their head muscle a little and yet retains the fun. The only downfall is that it's based on ""Trinity doctrine"" whereas we were looking for something a little more unbiased."
4,Very Slimming and Feminine,"I have worn these type of slips under short skirts and dresses for several years and I have found it very difficult to find this style of slip. I was ecstatic when I stumbled upon this item on Amazon.com. This slip by Rago is very feminine, slimming and smooth enough to wear undetected under my thinnest and tightest fitting skirts. I love the lace at the bottom which adds a sexy appeal if it slips out occasionally from below the hemline. The reason I rate it a 4 rather than a 5 is due to the fact that the seam has a small tear at the waistband which I was able to fix easily but I should not have had to. I wish they would make this slip in other colors, especially red, pink and purple."
3,EXPENSIVE!,"As much as I LOVE mint chocolate truffles, there's no way these are worth the cost. Think about it: $20.99 + $12.95 shipping = $33.94 / 60 = $0.57 per piece. WAY too expensive. And no, I did not waste that $$ for these."
5,Every little boy's daydream.........,The whimsical imaginative text and images make this book a favorite of both my 5 year old son and myself. Fun to read from space age concoctions to aerosol cheese! Be sure to look for the shy stickleback gar!
5,My son loves it!,"I happened to see this book at a kids discovery zone in a museum. I thought it would be a fun book, but I didn't realize it would be one of his favorites."
5,Really fun book to read,"We own A LOT of books for our kids, and this is one of our top favorites for sure. The rhyming is really good and upbeat and just plain fun to read. The story is about a little boy and his imaginative plans to build a ""dream"" car that does all sorts of cool things. Talk about the perfect ""boy"" book--though I am sure little girls would love it too! The car has a snack bar, flies in the air, can drive on water, and even smells good.The illustrations are really fun and colorful too. My 5 year old son has had me read this book to him so many times. It doesn't get old! We let our neighbor borrow it as well to read to her little boy, and her son loved it so much they bought him his own copy. Its really a catchy little book. Your child will love it. We went and bought some of the other books from the same author and we really like them as well. But this one is still our favorite."
4,Start Your Engines (and Your Imaginations!),"Van Dusen's illustrations offer a shiny, sleek, and stylishly retro look into the window of a child's inventive side. He's packed this book with everything a kid could want in their own car. A fun way to spark the imagination and the ignition!"
4,Great for classic car guys,Bought this book as part of my Dad's father's day present from his grandkids. He is a classic car guy and he loved it. I thought it would be a fun one to read with the grandbabies.
5,Great Read Aloud for my 4 year olds,"This is the first book I have read by this author and it is absolutely amazing. Done in rhyme, a child describes in perfect detail what the construction would be for his fine automobile.I read to my children every night and I read someone else's review at Amazon and stumbled upon this book, I have to say it is a huge hit, and it's been included in our reading selection during every daily read aloud. My kids are starting to memorize it and they just got it a few days ago!I can't wait to receive his other books! Buy this book, you won't be dissapointed!"
5,Super book for my son who loves cars!!!,"The text rhymes, but it has great thoughts and we had a discussion of what if he built a car. He is 4.5 but it was a great tool to open his mind. The pictures are great and now I'm off to check out his other books. Would love to see him be more widely known, I think this is a standout book!"
2,"Incorrect Track Listings, Lots of Cover Versions","When I ordered this, the track list for the first CD was incorrect.Here are the actual songs on that disc:1. George Lynch: Rock You Like a Hurricane2. Great White: Once Bitten Twice Shy3. Outlaws: Sweet Home Alabama4. Leif Garrett: The Final Countdown5. Winger: Seventeen6. L.A. Guns: Pour Some Sugar on Me7. Dave Mustaine (of Megadeth): School's Out8. Kelly Hansen (of Foreigner): Wheel in the Sky9. White Lion: Wait10. Blackfoot: Train, Train11. Atlanta Rhythm Section: Takin' Care of Business12. Elton John: Spirit in the Sky13. Canned Heat: On the Road Again14. Ted Nugent: Rag Doll15. Nazareth: Hair of the DogAs you can see, there are a lot of covers in there. And I was hoping for the studio version of Hair of the Dog, but it's not."
5,My favorite Gal Costa album,"This 1971 concert album captures the young Gal Costa at the peak of her powers. The first half is acoustic, the second half is an electrified acid rock extravaganza. An amazing record from the heady days of Brazil's ""tropicalia"" scene. Highly recommended."
3,"Good, but no real insight",This book helped me understand better. This book was easy to read and understand. I would recommend this book for anyone trying to get in the business.
5,Practice makes perfect!,"I have owned one of these calls for more than thirty years and as a birdwatcher, have found it helpful in bringing my elusive subjects into range of my camera lens. That said, you will not be able to make credible bird calls unless you are willing to practice, practice, practice just as you would with a musical instrument. The need to re-rosin will depend on the frequency of use and the average humidity in your area. On the negative side, the rosin is not readily obtainable if you run out or misplace it. You may wind up having to buy another call just to resupply yourself with rosin, but surely you know someone who would like the spare!"
3,"This is for ""True Blue"" fans!","Overall, this makes a good album to add to your JD collection... but if you're only ""so-so"" about John Denver, I'd reccomend getting a better recording. There are lots of good songs, as well as not-so-good songs, which only his true fans could appreciate. Also the sound quality is not so hot, and they've gone a little overboard with the echo. Personally, I like it a lot because his voice is breath-taking and I want to get my hands on pretty much everything that was released by him...=DSo, unless you're like me and want to collect ""everything"", I'd say go for something else. Good luck!"
4,Excellent! And written in Engish - by a Thai.,"Having lived in Thailand for several years, one begins to appreciate the significance of this achievement. Mr. Sudham shows keen understanding of a sharp narative and insight into both Thai and Western culture. In the end, it is an enjoyable read.However, that he did all this in English is remarkable. If it were translated, it would be understandable; however, it was written in English by this very bright author.I have also read his collection of short stories - the title escapes me at the moment. These were less noteworthy. I wonder if he is truly retreated to Buri Ram, running some sort of NGO or something, as people say.Jack KellyThunderbird 1999"

5,"Finally, my own copy of Green Christma$!!!","This is a great collection, including both Dragonet issues as well as Wunnerful, Wunnerful. The main reason I own it however is so that I can retain my sanity in our mercantile world by listening (again) to the refreshing breath that blows out the cobwebs -- Green Christmas.If you appreciate Freberg at all, this one is for you."
4,Great function but don't lose the instruction manual!,"Overall, I am happy with this watch. The Atomic timekeeping function is great, especially for traveling. I bought this watch for scuba diving and expect the atomic timekeeping to be quite convenient. You can adjust what features are displayed in the digital windows. As with any Baby-G, it looks like it can take quite a beating. It lights up well in the dark.The bad news: (1) You most definitely need to use the instruction manual to set up and maintain this watch. The functions of the buttons are not marked on the watch so you must use the manual to know which button does what. Moreover, hang on to the manual over time because you will undoubtedly need to refer to it to make any adjustments to the watch. (2) It's large for a woman's wrist. I'm a petite female and it is so large I suspect it will double as a self-defense device as well as I think I could give someone a nice welt if needed."
4,great atomic watch,"I love this watch, the size is no bigger than any of the other Baby G's. Love all the features of the watch. And it's really pretty cool when it picks up the signal from Colorado and sets the right time. The hands just move on their own to set the correct time."
4,Wonderful watch,"I live this watch! I like the fact that that it is a strong everyday watch, that it is water resistant, and has the 3 different places where you can display what you want. I have the day, the date, and a second timer.The only thing that is a bit challenging is changing the settings. You have to read the tiny manual to make your preferences. I'm not a watch techy person, so my husband does it for me."
4,A nice watch for ladies who like big watches!!,"I bought this as a birthday gift for myself, I have small wrists. I was excited to get the item until I opened the box and saw how big the watch actually is in real. If you do not like big watches please do yourself a favor and don't order this. If you like a big watch that's kinda masculine then by all means this is the watch for you."
5,"I love it, but...","I really love this sporty Atomic Timekeeping wrist watch, but you need to know that when you go to set it you will need to follow the instructions VERY carefully. I like that it's large for womans watch! It keeps great time once you figure out how to set it. If you lose the instructions, you can pull them up on line. P.S. this same watch is about (...) at Macy's! Buy from Amazon and save!!"
4,Stylish and affordable,Very cool. It's GPS/satellite connected so you never have to set it! That was a surprised to me. I bought it cause it's so good looking and it is.
5,"Unusual songs, exquisite execution.","Don't buy this for background music. You really need to listen carefully to this music to appreciate it. The songs are quite unusual, but they are interesting and entertaining. They show off Rebecca's voice well, and her execution is flawless. You'll find yourself wanting to hear the same song several times in a row."
3,Interesting,"This is quite an interesting book. It is a collection of essays by Anatole France on a variety of topics. While Anatole France had intended to release the book during his lifetime, he was unable to finish it. As a result it was released as an unfinished work with a significant amount of commentary by the editor. Some of the essays are presented in the form of a dialogue while others are in the more traditional essay form. I found the most interesting articles deal with the Anatole France's position in relation to the war which was very controversial at the time. I was also interested in his views about religion, as I knew he described himself as an atheist. Unfortunately, I was not too sure whether this chapter was reflecting the editors own views about the subject or Anatole Frances' views."
1,Mike Mentzer' HIT by a different author,The training system is not new. It is the same stuff Mike Mentzer used to tout as far back as 1975 when Mentzer made his bodybuilding comeback in the AFAB/IFBB Mr. USA contest.Who is Darden anyway? Has he ever competed or is just an author with 12 inch arms trying to beef up his bank account?
1,Overated,"I would suggest most potential buyers to check out either ""the Body Sculpting Bible"" or ""Men's Health Book of Muscle"" instead of this one. The author claims his method will work for anyone, yet every single one of the subjects cited in the book was a Professional Bodybuilder. Also, he spends too much space talking himself up."
4,Not the best story telling - but the content is great,"I am rounding two months through High Intensity Training and I have recieved great gains for the amount of time that you devote to the system. I used to be someone who worked everyday and felt bad not doing so, but this book really shows you the ways to make improvements and develop in just a sliver of the time that I once thought necessary. It has everything you need from exact workouts and when to do them - to Muscle specific WO's as well. All of the book is backed by some research and tales of its creator (which is where the author try's to be a little humorous in parts I guess) but if you can get through that then this book has good info. Heads up though, it is the size of a college textbook haha and probably the first one that I read cover to cover..."
3,"a lot of bark, but no bite...","The good: More than half this book contains information on the history of competitive weight training and HIT's impact on it. The stories are interesting, well writen and fun. The 25% of the book that focuses on specific HIT principles is also good... breakdown of excersises by effectiveness is also interesting and enlightening.The bad: Only about 25% of the book specifically deals with the actual training program, system and analysis. Which makes sense, since the book's training formula and philosophy is very simple... but perhaps... it's too simple.I don't think I would have bought this book if I had seen it first..."
1,too many reps . . . I mean books,"The principles of so-called ""High Intensity Training"" are VERY basic and simple and can be summed up and digested by reading a few choice articles found on a Google search.I won't get into the debate about whether this approach is genius or nonsense . . . but writing another book about this ""technique"" IS definitely NONSENSE."
2,Don't waste your money.,"I don't know how long ago I bought this book, but I forgot about it, and recently I saw an article about Dorian Yates in a magazine and he was talking about how he adapted his style from Mike Mentzer. So, I was looking for a Mike Mentzer book at the store when I remembered I had bought this one and that it must be somewhere mixed in with all my other books. So, I wetn home and found it.Much of the book just seems to be Darden's biased opinions: his love of Arthur Jones, his bashing of Arnold and the Mentzers, etc. If you want a book that just talks about HIT training, then you don't want this one. It's not worth the money. You can learn just as much about HIT training by asking on any messageboard that discusses bodybuilding."
3,Typical Darden,Most of Dardens books are pretty much the same as the others. This one is not much different from the rest.
2,NOT a too good Workout book,"After reading through the book, I thought it wasn't too well written. It pretty much tells of a guy that gained incredible amount of muscle in a very short time but doesn't tell you exactly how to do that. Plus I don't think it's a good idea to gain that much of muscle in such a short time."
3,It just didn't HIT the spot,"This book was not what I expected at all. I needed some insight on some hardcore intensity training, but this book would rather talk about the beginning of bodybuilding and body sculpting. If you make it to the end of the book, it does have some helpful workout examples, nutrition information, and some workout cards. If the whole book contained this type of information, it would be more beneficial. I could have done without the slow history of bodybuilding, because I could have bought another book to do that."
2,good book but takes way too long to get to the topic,Good book if you like reading about the authors background into the subject. He just took to long praising the man who basically invented the technique. This book could have been way smaller in volume. I would go with the Encyclopedia of Muscle and Strength. It took a page to detail what this technique is all about. I would pass on this one.
5,"Great read, this book completely changed the way I lift.","I was very skeptical when I dove into this book but the results speak for themselves.I have gained so much in so little time and have devoted a fifth of the effort to do so. The author uses facts and examples to back up everything that he claims and explains it as simply as he can. It is a very entertaining book. I am just your average college student and it has made life so much easier. I used to lift five days a week for 2 hours a day, now I lift twice a week for about 25 mins per workout. This book opens your eyes to reality, muscles need to have recovery time. If you follow what he says, you will have results, period."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of Murakami but this one was a disappointment. It contains lots of boring 'filler' where you sense he was padding out what should have been a short story into novel length. And the writing is painfully pedestrian. This could be the fault of the translator, but there's no excuse for overuse of the word 'incredible.' Even the writing of the main character, Sumire, who is supposedly a brilliant writer, is indistinguishable in style and tone from that of the narrator, who is Murakami's usual 'regular guy.' The 2001 copyright date is surprisingly recent. This work feels like juvenilia. I give it 2 stars instead of one because there are occasional flashes of the Murakami I love. But if you're new to this author, don't start with Sputnik Sweetheart."
3,"Wanted to like it, didn't really.","Like other reviewers, i find myself buying every Murakami book waiting for another Wind-Up bird. Or at least another Hardboiled. I guess that's my (our) fault. Whatever. The point is, if you haven't read everything of his already, pay attention first to the first half of his career. That's where the majority of the gold lies. At that point, you'll be so hooked on him, you'll want to read this one anyway, even though there's a fair amount of reviews telling you it's not so great."
5,"just read it, a lovely friendship story,","a cute love story, &#305; enjoy it a lot, ""sputnik"" means a friend for a journeyThat's when the stories come apart to reveal each other in a suspenseful, hypnotic, Russian-doll kind of way. There are echoes of John Fowles's The Magus as the reasonable, likeable young narrator finds himself in a beautiful yet sinister place, wading deeper into mysterious waters, each new set of circumstances stranger and more seductive than the last. Some of the dark, mesmerising plot teases of Paul Auster or Ian McEwan also spring to mind. But, though that would be incentive enough, it's not why you read on."
3,early Murakami,Beautifully written (at least in translation) as is all of Murakami's work. This is a haunting meditation on longing but the stranger aspects of the story work less well than they do in other of his novels.
3,This Beautiful Strange World,"Sputnik Sweetheart is my first Haruki Murakami novel. This novel was absolutely beautifully written. An somewhat obsessive love story, if you will. The words and the flow made it a pleasure to read from start to finish. Kudos to the translators. The story told was a bit much for me, I was left with many ""whys"" and agonizing up at night over the meaning of some details. I know some people love this type of novel, that keeps you pondering and discussing with friends, but I like answers, I like to know."
3,easy but not simple,"A despondant study of the loneliness of the human condition. Unrequited love is everywhere here - everyone is in love with someone and you can be certain, will never be loved back. Well, at least not in their current reality, but are we all capable of loving someone in a different consiousness? Vintage Murakami. A poetically simple narrator, a troubled protagonist and a quantum leap into another universe. (The main character literally vanishes from the storyline).If you enjoy being lulled into an `easy read' but every now and then stop to consider something quite profound, you will love this. In fact, a Sputnik Sweetheart Q & A is still going on in my head."
4,impressive,"I approached this one cautiously, it being the first Japanese novel for me, and I was pleasantly surpised. Most engaging. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
4,"Nice, readable book","This is Murakami I loved best, and it seems that all other books are not even close, although I read just 3 of his books. A bit like Borghes , a bit like road movie..."
2,rugurgitation,"i hear that the japanese publishing companies can be unforgiving with their pressure -- trying to get authors to consistently produce product on schedule. well, if kodansha's to blame for this one, shame on them.i've been a fan of murakami's for several years now, and i like all of his books to a greater or lesser extent. this is definitely the least of them, in my opinion. this new permutation of his traditional narrator character superimposed over a narrative -- that seems nothing so much as shoplifted from a banana yoshimoto novel -- ends up trite and stale. oh, what is love? it's a guy who likes jazz and whisky with a hard-on for a cute girl who may or may not sleep with him for no readily apparent reason. thanks, mr. murakami, but you can do much, much better than this."
1,Cheated out of an ending,"This is the story of a strange love triangle, wherein the main character disappears. There are some nice moments in the book, but it seems as if the writer was short on plot lines and never really finished it, and didn't bother to connect a lot of the narrative to the plot.He seemed to set up a lot of metaphor and other nice images but never used them to their fullest.It was meant to be a melancholy love story + a mystery, but it ended up being a complete waste of time and ink."
1,"So, so bad",Ignore the alluring cover; this book is like reading paint dry. Don't say I didn't warn you.
3,Murakami Style but Missing an Ending,I have read almost all of Murakami's work and truly enjoyed it. The twists and turns of his cutting edge plots are unusually engaging and thought provoking. I was disappointed with Sputnik Sweetheart simply because the ending lacked the spice and creativity of many of his other works.
4,eccentric romance involved in a gloomy atmosphere,"This is my 2nd book of Murakami's novels, this time around he decides to drive the story in a more romantic yet undescribable type of sadness which establishes a characters vivid but gloomy understanding of his feelings for his friend and her utterly unstable manner of thinking and not thinking, with the comprehensive tone of dreaming. Comparison to his other novels, Murakami still maintains his original composure of narrarating a story with deep and inspiring scenarios.I truly enjoyed this story and recommend it to people that have a taste in unique story lines such as this, though it fairly does require a lot of deep knowledge in order to divulge the perspective of the author's grasp."
4,Good But Not Among His Best!,"I really enjoyed this novel, but it does not rank among his best in my opinion... Well worth reading if you are a Murakami fan, but otherwise dive into one of his other novels first (maybe After Dark or Hard Boiled Wonderland ~ both of these are relatively short and quick reads).I find that the characters in this novel are among the least likable and to me that is not typical Murakami."
3,Disappointing from Murakami,"I've read all of Murakami's English translations now, except for Underground, and this has to be my least favorite. It just left me when an empty feeling. I realize this is one of his more popular books, but it just didn't do it for me. If you are new to Murakami, read Kafka on the Shore, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, or Norwegian Wood first."
4,Lonely but Lucky,"This is not a sappy tale about unrequited love. Instead, Murakami casts a positive light on a frustrating friendship and an ethereal connection that are very real. His characters endure uncontrollable forces that drive eerie encounters and realizations. And the reader grasps that a feeling or memory of love, however fulfilled or unfulfilled, remains a source of motivation."
3,"good, but too long","This novel should have been a novella. The core of the novel is about 50 pages long, and really good, but it takes too long to get to it. There is a unique quality of strange ethereal mystery at the core. Fortunately, it's a quick read so you don't feel like it wasn't worth it. It ends like After Dark, leaving you hanging.The best thing about this author is his tender understanding of people."
5,The XD Picture Card is fast and efficient,"Although a little expensive for its size, it is very fast when deleting, viewing, and taking photos. The 64MB card is a good size, taking about 101 photos on a 2 megapixel camera with the highest quality, which is plenty for a home use digital camera. I have experienced other cards, such as SmartMedia and CompactFlash and they are bulky and are considerably slower. Although it could be my previous cameras, I believe the cards have a greater impact. Also, about the price, the price for the cards are going down. Don't listen to bad reviewers...they are just bitter that their cameras are out of date and do not feature the XD picture cards."
4,Response to Daniel from Sacramento,"Your post titled: This chip does not fit in Olympus Camedia D-380Maybe you should try reading the product descriptions BEFORE you buy. Then you'd realize that the Olympus Camedia D-380 uses a SMART MEDIA card and NOT the xD card you bought.So really there's nothing wrong with the product, just with your buying habits!"
1,disappear from here,"I could not agree more on the issue brought up here. As if there were not already enough memory formats, yet another one. It seems to be about either desperate, or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever. Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory?? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives. And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus.Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus, and now Fuji/Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card. Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices. We need to standardize the market. We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device. If you buy Fuji/0lympus, I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD. Together the people can control the market for our own good.."
2,Not standard,"Although the card itself is not bad technology, it is NOT the standard (which is compact flash, CF). If you ever upgrade to a better camera or another device that uses memory cards (MP3 players, or SLR camera, etc) then you'll lose your investment in these XD cards. Also, since they are proprietary and non standard they cost more per megabyte. I would never purchase a camera that uses non standard proprietary cards (like Sony, which uses their own ""memory sticks"" or Fuji and the XD cards). But if you already bought a camera which requires them, then you really have no choice. Standards are important with new technology (remember betamax vs. VHS) so that early adopters don't have equipment that becomes obsolete, or unduly pricey due to lack of competition.If you have a choice, try to buy devices that use CF (compact flash) and protect your investment. Just my two cents."
2,"ggrr, got me all disgruntled","I just got into photography as a major hobby and got a new fuji camera that uses this memory card.I recently went to buy one of those memory card computor adaptors and the bloke from the counter told me there weren't any standard kind for this memory card! This was a major disadvantage for me in my class and can be a disadvantage if you bought (or received for x-mas) a [bad] fugi camera.So now I just have to use the regular lousy way of hooking the camera up to the computor and waisting my batteries. (and it takes a day to recharge those things)That is the worst thing about this memory card. It's expensive (though I take all cards are) too and it holds well, unless you make a film with it."
1,XP - doesn't work,"I tried and tried. Despite the lable on the packaging, it is not XP compatible and, after you buy it, XP tells you so - the fujifilm packaging says it is XP compatible, but the fujifilm website (which is devoid of any updates) says:Operating Systems: Windows 98/98SEWaste of money and, worse, waste of time."
1,Don't use if you have Windows XP,"This reader worked correctly for a while - then the menu failed to come up when a card is placed in the reader. After uninstalling, and trying to re-install, I am getting warnings that it is not compatable with windows XP, and though I tried to ignore the warnings, the drivers are not available. I have not been able to find the drivers anywhere on the fugi support site. A waste of money."
5,No Problem,"No driver required, plugged it in and it appeared as an extra removeable disk. Didn't even need to look at instructions. Does everything it should."
2,poor instructions,"i'm not ready to say if this product is worth anything or not. it does, however, have probably the worst instructions that i have encountered. the disc instructions will not read off the disc and the so-called ""owner's manual"" offers software set-up instructions in type that requires a magnifying glass to see. while i was able to get the software loaded, the manual told me to go to the disc for operating instructions. i still don't know how to operate the device."
1,Driver messed up my Mac,"Competing products, such as by Lexar require no driver. That is a good thing since after installing the software for this poorly engineered product my keyboard no longer produced the same characters as I typed. That is, I would type a ""0"" and a ""2"" would appear. Some whole fields would fill with gibberish. After problems with xD cards, a Fuji camera, and this reader, I have grave reservations about this company's products."
2,Fujifilm USB xD Picture Card Reader,"Not work in System OS 10.3, works good with oldest version......!!!!!!!NO any new program to resolve this"
5,Stella Bowen's Drawn from Life,"This is a unique perspective by a rare, intelligent, and courageous person on Paris of the '20s--the same scene (and many of the same people) as Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises."" And Bowen sees with a painter's eye--as well as writing with great skill. The book is a gem!"
3,Its a little better than 3 but...,"After the release of his live album you would think Ligabue would move to a more intricate musical direction but instead he delivers a steady guitar driven rock record with solid production values... it does fall short of some of his previous material but not that far off, happy hour is probably that low point but still has more rock n roll in it than some of the stuff coming out in the US market... So if you like LIGA its worth listening to"
5,"""Punch Yourself in the Crotch as Hard as you Can""","The only bad thing about Sean Carnage's rockumentary/ performance experiment is the feeling of regret you'll have that you didn't get to participate in this totally insane evening. 40 bands each given 2 minutes to perform- and these groups are some of the strangest you're likely to see in one sitting. Unsung luminaries like Whitman, Captain Ahab, and Gowns give (presumably) their feature film debuts while all kinds of other chaos ensues- including a man making a sandwich with his feet! Captures the fun and oddity of a night with the new weird underground, as well as providing a useful document/primer for anybody going to L.A. who likes bands on labels like Wantage, Load, and Bulb."
2,Shoot me now.,"This has to be one of the worst casebooks I have ever read. The biggest complaint I have is that, for some reason, the author feels compelled to reveal the entire legislative history for every statute or immigration guideline. So if you are studying INA 237(x)(x)(x) you will not only get the very recent changes that led up to the statute, but the last 30 years of history. For true scholars of the law who have nothing better to do with their lives than read irrelevant legislative history I am sure this will please them. For actual law students who think succinctness is a virtue, stay away. Another minor problem is that the author has failed to label his notes. Labeling notes is a very common practice and is very helpful in summarizing what the note is about without having to first read it. Of course, I find the very subject of immigration law to be about as boring a class in law school as I have ever taken so maybe this casebook is just making the best out of a bad situation."
5,"GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!","The only this I can say about this album is GREAT! She is one good singer and it's sad that she only has one album. This album is a great buy, seldom do we see albums wherein all the songs are great. Her vesions are something else... her voice is somethinh else too. Buy this one, worth every dollar!"
5,"Sexy, smokey, sultry and gorgeous.","This is by far one of the finest examples of the ""less is more,"" theory. Ms. Baron's voice seduces and shimmers, most especially on the ballads, like Stevie Wonder's ""If It's Magic."" But she is not just a simple torch singer, as she proves on ""Ain't No Sunshine,"" and ""Got to Get You Into My Life,"" where she drives every moment of the funky arrangement. And with one listen, you'll see she now owns a little known Mary Black song called, ""Columbus."" The album isn't a big production. But it's an amazing little gem."
5,A Jazzy Pick-Me-Up by a Superb Female Voice,"Christy Baron's CD ""I Thought About You"" is a perfect refresher to a dull, dreary winter day. Whether it is a mixture of jazz and classical it is tough to say---but it is easy to say that it is one of the best in its class out there. Get in your car, slip it into the CD player and hit the straightaway. You will mellow out. Her rendition (>6 minute) of Over the Rainbow is far better than Judy or Liza....the best cut on the CD. I had not heard of her previous to her appearance in a concert as a lead in to Johnny Mathis. She was superb. The only trouble is that it appears that this is her only CD."
3,Simplemente FABULOSO,"Como muchos de ustedes, tengo varias de estasexcelentes grabaciones en disco de larga duracion.Pero, OMG que perron es volver a escucharlashoy en dia con disco compacto.Los arreglos, los musicos y las vocestodo en conjunto dando un sonidoclasico de la salsa.Ojala pueda volver a obtener todaslas grabaciones de Mario Ortiz en CD!Se los recomiendo."
4,Great!,"I bought this as a gift for my parents. They absolutely loved it, which was the point! It made them remember the good ole times when they were kids. I wish I could have gotten more candy for what I paid for though. The bag looked much bigger in the picture than the real thing. Overall, a great buy for loved ones of all ages!"
5,Fantastic,"We had an Easters party and i purchase this product to fill my pinata , The kids was surprised and happy with the candy's ."
4,Great!,"This product really works! I was using a paper blotter that didn't have powder and felt it wasn't working well. I like to use the side with the powder after traveling all day. It wicks away the grease and adds a fine layer of powder, without taking off makeup, but adding a nice cover. I feel refreshed, and my face looks great, instead of greasy and shiny. Awesome! So glad I found this!"
1,It's NOT good,"The reviewer Jo Ana Starr is right, this canned ""lobster bisque"" is plain gross. I am a lifelong New Englander and I've been enjoying lobster bisque for 30 years...this stuff is NOT lobster bisque. It's an odd-colored concoction of canola oil, milk, and ""native tapioca starch."" I paid $3.89 for a (tiny) 10-oz can, and I'm very disappointed. There is so much canola oil in it, you can feel it on your tongue. No lobster flavor at all. It's a travesty that they're using the name ""Bar Harbor."""
1,This Stuff's Gross,"Shame on the Bar Harbor Soup Company for falsely inflating their review, with a five-star one of their own. The color doesn't bother me, but the taste certainly does. It's just not lobster bisque. I don't expect much from a can in the first place, but this falls far below expectations. It is edible, but not by much.A few years ago in California lobster bisque was quite hard to come by, so I paid five dollars for a can of this stuff. Waited expectantly while it cooked and threw it all out after the first bite. This product is a bust. Sad though, because the city of Bar Harbor, Maine has some of the best lobster bisque in New England."
1,worst lobster bisque,"I thought it was the worst lobster bisque I have ever had. No flavor. I tried doctoring it up with some other seasonings, didn't work. Very disapointed. Would never recommend it."
3,You can really taste the tomato,"If you're looking for a creamy lobster bisque (like that at Red Lobster), this isn't it. Not much lobster and the tomato taste is very strong. To be fair, most bisque is tomato-based, but you really taste the tomato with this product. If you love tomatoes, you'll like this bisque."
4,Garlic for sure,"Received the garlic in a timely manner but the garlic is only half the amount we usually take and is really smelly, but glad we could get it."
4,A Nice Blend of Acoustic and Electronic Sounds,"I Ching comprises four members: three Chinese musicians (Sisi Chen on Chinese dulcimer, Tao Chen on bamboo flute, and Bao Li Zhang on er-hu, a two-stringed Chinese fiddle) and Joel Goodman on synthesizer and sampler. The tunes pretty well alternate between oriental folk tunes arranged by Goodman and original compositions by Goodman--in light of his omnipresence on the CD, it is strange that he is the only one of the four musicians not pictured on the back cover. The blend of acoustic instruments with synthesized sounds works quite well, and the music is quite enjoyable, with more substance than the typical New Age recording. As you might expect from Chesky, the sound quality is first-class, although I did not find the claim, ""recorded in natural surround sound"" to be fully substantiated in my system."
4,Asian music that is modern,This is Asian music that has a very modern feel to it. It is very enjoyable and pleasant and makes great background music for a night of reading or spending time with a friend.I think this would be a great introduction for people who may not have listened seriously to Asian music before. They could get hooked on this. The CD gets better with each new playing as you grwo to like it more each time.
2,great scent with a difficult-to-open bottle,"I love the Be Delicious scent, but the difficult-to-open bottles make this an impractical purchase. Buy the regular-sized bottle instead. The small canister set seem more appropriate for display. If you don't mind a cute display, buy it. I patiently opened them when I first received the gift pack, but I haven't tried again since. I will regift this ASAP."
4,NoBody 49,You would think after leaving the Cure Lol Tolhurst would waste away into nothing or come back with his own music and it would totally suck. In this case he did come back and came back on a ray of sunshine. After buying both of their albums I can't stop listening to them. Before you hear it you might think of the Cure because of Mr. Tolhurst but after the first track the Cure is the last thing on your mind. It's just brilliant. The only thing that I don't like about Levinhurst is that they don't have more albums but i'm sure that will change. Two Thumbs Up. Way Up!!!!!
5,"Creative, nice.","I like this CD a lot! The vocalist (Female) has a remarkably awesome voice. It goes especially good with this sort of music. Like most folks, I like many different types of music but I especially like this type. It is quite mellow with various unusual (synthesized) sounds mixed in with the songs. I don't know a single word to describe this type of music. --- All kinds of subtle sounds well mixed about in the songs that really enhance the feeling. It is full of a lot of feeling. Often makes me feel quite pleasantly introspective. One of those CD's that sounds really good with a good pair of headphones. The vocalist husband was in the band the cure which I also liked. But this is different from the cure."
5,A Beautiful Collection of Songs,"Ana Caram has a beautiful voice and does a wonderful job of interpreting the songs of Antonio Carlos Jobim, who was Brazil's greatest composer. Most of the songs on this CD were written by Jobim and they are lush and sensual. Before I purchased this CD, I had never heard of Ana Caram (I was familiar with Astrud Gilberto and Elis Regina, two of Brazil's most famous singers). Now I know of another great singer! This CD is a ""sure thing."""
3,Sales pitch more than advices good for consumers,I bought the book to start learning about Personal Finance. I found the book not very satisfactory because it only reiterates information that you can get from any financial product marketing material which contains more sales pitch then facts important for consumers.
2,Not quite...,"Installed this under a desk at work, the machine hung at an angle despite all the bolts being secured. There is no adjust other than for the size of the CPU. It is not possible to mount it flush against the side of the desk which causes the issue with it hanging at an angle. However, a small 2x4 painted black bolted to the side of desk leveled the unit out but ridiculous I had to jerry rig a brand new mount. I will go another route next time."
4,"Enjoyable, easy-going cop thriller","Save this book for weekend comfort food. ""The Disappeared"" is a futuristic cop thriller with a small, believable cast, a simple, credible story and a topic you can invest as much -- or as little - thought in as you please.The mismatched detective pair find themselves in the unenviable position of having to enforce laws they find (literally) inhumane. Rusch's vision of a humanity that utterly flunks its first interactions with alien species rings completely true. The aliens in ""The Disappeared"" don't just look and sound different from us, they make fundamentally different assumptions about right and wrong, fair and unfair."
2,Great writing. Way too much graphic violence.,"I'd rather spend my time reading a novel that finds a way to engage me, and ramp up the stakes, without such graphic violence."
5,Great People,This movie is great! I love watching them sing and have fun. I personally know them and they are so funny and I wish everyone could know them on a personal level.
4,Delightful,"I usually don't watch stuff about older folks - mainly because I don't want to get emotional after being a caretaker for my elderly parents - but I'm so glad I watched this touching, funny, sweet documentary. Yes, there were a couple of sad moments, but the majority of the film was very inspiring, entertaining, funny, cute, and uplifting. I had been feeling a little down about getting older myself lately, but when I saw these 80 and 90 year old men and women singing rock and roll and loving life, I realized it's all about staying active, socializing, and having a young attitude. As a geologist and someone who loves rock and roll, I guess the moral of my review should by ""ROCK ON!""(I gave the documentary four stars rather than five because it dragged along mid-movie.)"
5,Wonderful and heartwarming,"I really loved this movie, document. It was a wonderful reminder that old folks were ""Somebody"" before they got so old. There were tears and laughter in my experience."
5,"Rockin' Oldsters, Living Large","Young@Heart shows just how young ""old"" can be. This is heartwarming, inspirational, and very entertaining, both for its music and its story. I've now watched it 3x (twice more than I normally watch anything) and am still vastly entertained and touched each time. These documentarists did a wonderful job - but then, they had amazing and wonderful subjects!"
4,Great Message,"This was a great documentary! So often we think that just because a person is in their ""golden years"" their lives are mundane, this group of seniors proves that belief wrong time and time again."
5,young@heart,"this is one of the best, most inspiring, entertaining films i have ever seen! i have recommended this to everyone of every age i know - and they have loved it too!"
5,Young @ heart,"This is an amazing documentary film. It's full of energy, love and passion. Nobody, after watching this film, would say again: ""I can't do that. I'm too old!!"". Anybody can do anything!!. :)"
5,"""Young at Heart"" DVD","A great DVD that I would recommend to all ages. A documentary that will make you laugh, make you smile, and make you cry. Above all, it will make you appreciate our time on earth and that growing old isn't a bad thing."
5,Good but not perfect,"The DVD's arrived on time and I gave them as Christmas gifts. Just spoke to my sister who received one of them and she tells me the DVD is not perfect, it skips a little. I think this is the finest film I've seen in a long time and liked the service I received from Amazon."
5,Young @ Heart,"Good story about a group of older folks learning to sing the days kind of music and want they go Thur. Some of the song are""Purple Haze,"" Jimi Hendrix""Schizophrenic,"" Sonic Younth""Fix You,"" Coldplayvery put together film"
5,Inspiring,"I really enjoyed this film. It tugs at your heart strings, and is educational as well. I would definitely recommend it."
1,Little to go on,"I saw ""Young @ Heart"" in the theaters and I think the film crew wasn't as great as they could've been. The music videos weren't great and disrupted the flow of the movie. The interviews were pretty flat and there's simple non-invasive ways of making the characters more interesting besides hanging out with them while driving.The concert at the end was the high point of the film with its touching rendition of ""Fix You"", but the rest of the documentary stayed within the too-safe confines of cute and unoffensive. I would've liked to have seen more of an emotional storyline throughout the film (like what was seen in the concert at the end of the film)."
5,Excellent Sunglasses,"The sunglasses are awesome. I was the owner of a pair of polarized Arnettes and I thought I only ever wanted Arnettes but these glasses are comfortable, stylish, polarized, came with a soft and very nice hard case. I cannot say enough about how happy I am with my purchase. Don't hesitate, get these before they discontinue them!!!"
2,Overpriced and over roasted.,There are much better coffee's available on the market for far less money that are of significantly higher quality. I was very disappointed in this purchase.
1,One of the most unlikeable heroes I've encountered,"I can't understand why anyone would give this book five stars! Of course, a story about a beautiful, wealthy princess who is in hiding is always great, but what's the deal with this ""hero?"" He is mean, rude, and all-around awful. I found it totally implausible that she liked him because he ""treated her just like anyone else."" Sorry Ms. Roberts, no one likes being treated like crap. This book was pretty ridiculous."
1,A Rare Miss for Roberts,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. But I have to say it, in Cordina's Crown Jewel she misses the mark. In Delaney Caine she has created her first uninteresting, unattractive, just plain boringly predictable male. His character and motivations never gel. I say skip this one, and head on over to her excellent Eve Dallas series (written under the pseudonym of J.D. Robb). Following those characters through 13 (and counting) books is definitely never boring, and each one gets better and better as the characters and their relationships solidify. Don't waste valuable reading time with Cordina's Crown Jewel; this is the only Nora Roberts I'm going to give away."
4,The final chapter of a interesting family.,It was a nice conclusion to the cordina's family...I liked the previous books best but it was still nice to read about life of the family without the killing.
4,Great Finish,This book was a great ending to the series. Nora Roberts knows what she is doing! This one I loved!
3,A Little Bit of a Fantasy,This was not my favorite book by Nora Roberts. The story was too close to a fantasy for me. I found myself frustrated with the plot. It seemed to drag out too long with little action in the middle.
4,ok,I am a huge Nora Roberts fan but this book was not my favorite. I just couldn't get into the characters. I liked Del...but couldn't get a solid picture in my mind which doesn't happen very often when reading Nora's books....Cam was ok but typical....it was a fast read and I really liked the ending...the characters fought throughout the book...but it was a very romantic ending! It is worth the time but not her best work....
4,A little gem!,"Whenever I want a light, charming read, I read Nora. I am an addict fan of her ""...in Death"" series. Those are 'to die for.' but this was an amusing little story,if you overlook similarities to Roman Holiday. I'll read any Nora Roberts' book anytime. It cannot be that much of a miss. (I'm heading out to buy ""Reunion in Death"" to add to my collection."
3,Roman oliday Remake,"I have read this book. Ireally enjoyed it, especially the scenario of a member of aroyal family who runs away to America and meets the man/woman of his/her dreams. That's what I call a remake of Roman Holiday. Nora Roberts writes great love stories."
3,Jam with Carlos Santana with CD,"The CD & book are very good to play along with, also the chords & notes are right in the book, only one thing they dont tell you, they are not the entire songs. Europa, Black Magic Woman, etc are all cut short & dont play through the guitar solos, so there are several minutes cut out of each song, so its not the entire song. If you dont care about the solos its fine, but this says its a jam, to me soloing is the best part of the jam & they are all cut out"
1,cheap cheap,"wow seriously shoddy stuff.you know the holder has those poorly sewn jaggedy edges - super light fragile plastic, ear buds that don't work or your friends complain so much about them you go back to putting that extremely HOT phone next to your ear.that phone that will eat batteries in weeks. oh yeah sorry you bought that phone. well after 9 months or so - you will be.I am so unhappy with samsung products right now. it is hard for this geek to express. do the safe thing get something with quality control. Wish I had gotten anothe nokia or a crackberry... <sigh>"
2,Kinda crappy.,"The first time I ordered, I only got twp of the three items. The next time, I got everything, but the case doesn't really fit."
1,Keep the car charger.,"Well, I've ordered this item twice and each time I only receive two pieces in the box. I got the car charger and a leather case that you have to work very hard to make the phone fit into but it's not the case that is shown in the picture before ordering. I need the case shown to keep the phone from falling out by the strap across the top. They sent something totally different. I guess I'll keep the car charger because of the price for it alone is great."
3,a little disappointed with the leather case,"Well, I bought this few weeks back and I must say, the car charger and the ear-phones are good to use(although you get one pair of ear-phones with the phone) you can have another spare one.But I was really disappointed with the leather case. It is 100% not waste. you can just trash it. It is made of cheap material and dont NOT fit the phone at all. you have to spend atleat 5 mins to push the phone inside the case and then another 5 mins to pull it out when your phone rings..so bottomline: throw the so called leather case and use only the other 2 items."
4,Filling with Great taste/ Little pricy,"the title says it all. It tastes amazing, and leaves you feeling full for quite a while.Servings:3 scoops per serving20 servings per 4.27lbs containerKind of expensive - $1.50 per serving is you subscribe and save."
5,protein with a punch,This doesn't have the best taste but your not drinking it for the taste but for all the wonderful muscle building properties this product contains. After Max helps immensely in reducing the soreness right after and the day after a heavy workout. Would recommend to anyone who is serious about building muscle and not so concerned about the taste.
1,Terrible taste,"I've tried to use this product several times but cannot get past the taste. I bought the Optimum Nutrition 2:1:1 Recovery shake in Colossal Chocolate and thought it was SO DELICIOUS, so I was expecting the same taste from this product, and was extremely disappointed. If you're someone who uses a lot of Splenda/Aspartame-type sweeteners, perhaps you'll be okay with this, but for me it was overly sweet with barely any chocolate flavor. Hopefully I can pawn this off on my one of my friends who can tolerate the taste and I'll go back to the delicious 2:1:1 shake."
3,It doesn't taste good.,"Don't get me wrong, you need carbs and protein after a hard workout but I can't stomach the taste of this drink. It tastes like chemicals or some cheap protein you would buy from walgreens or CVS.The nutrition facts are adequate (although I don't like the creatine in it.. 5g is quite a bit). My preferred option would be to buy a jug of Strawberry True Mass (weight gainer) from BSN AND a jug of Syntha 6 protein (Cookies and Cream) and mix a scoop of each in order to get the carbs and protein you need (and it tastes WAAAY better)."
2,sweetened with splenda :( . . . but you get results :),"So i've tried different post workouts and haven't really found one that is great tasting, and honestly i dont think that exist. So by now, i am pretty much use to drinking some nasty tasting shakes (or supplements over all). I've become pretty tolerant to taste. BUT, this is just nasty tasting. Even for me. Right off the back, it taste very artificial and very dry. And after it got me nauseous and a headache. Which is typical when consuming artificial sweeteners like Splenda.Now the taste is bad enough but, after a week or so i kind of got used it (added more water, a lot more water). but the Slenda effect, i just can't get rid of. Its sad because i was actually seeing nice results. I saw in other websites that this product contains no artificial flavoring, which is weird. maybe they changed their recipe? I hope so."
4,Tastes aight,The taste is aight. Its got carbs an creatine so thats a plus. Good amount for the money. I dont know what else to say.
3,Scoops,My order did not come with a scooper! now i have no way of knowing how much to mix. could someone please tell me the approximate volume of the scooper?
4,taste great!,I read reviews where they say the after taste sucks. I love it. It tastes so good. It doesn't mix as well as previous brand though. I don't know about the effectiveness of the drink because I havn't seen big difference. I only used it for few weeks now. I feel like lifting everyday so that I can have a shake.
2,Works well - tastes awful,"While the product works pretty well for recovery purposes, it honestly tastes awful. It's very bland and I find myself having to choke it down. I won't be buying it again."
2,Terrible taste!,"I'm new to the gym scene, been doing cardio exercise for some time now. I decided to go with Optimum Nutrition After Max based on research I did. Now this review is not based on how I felt after I drank it...but I struggled to finish it due to the awful taste and chalkyness. I put it in a shaker & even tried adding more water to dilute, but it didn't help. I did add milk also thinking it would help with the taste but NG. Since I spent the money, i'll continue on with it but after I'm done I'll have to try something else."
1,Contains Wheat,Only reason this is getting a negative review is b/c this product contains wheat. The product description page doesn't list any allergen information. I never would've ordered this if I knew it contained wheat.
4,Insightful,"This book catches yor attention immediately and draws you into the help it offers very easily. I found that most of the exercises were easy to do on my own, some will require the assistance of another person more experienced in past life changework. (depending on the level of work you are looking to do) It is great for people who are looking to find out why they do the things they do and why they feel so completely absorbed by things at certain times. It teaches profound lessons that anyone could benefit from, as long as it is read with an open mind. Read it and you will be changed."
5,Great collection of marvelous videos by EC!,"This video collection is as cool as the matching CD is lame! From the solitude of EC playing acoustic guitar on a soundstage on ""Tears In Heavan"" to the very hip black and white ""Motherless Child"" to the rain soaked ""Pretending"" these are all very tasty clips. The only drawbacks are two cuts from ""unplugged"" and one from ""24nights"" which are already commercially available..but understandable inclusions."
2,"Pointless, cheap and a waste of time","Of all the artists with documentaries and video compilations, Eric Clapton continues to get the short end of the stick. This chintzy collection of common videos is both a waste of your time as well as money.With piles of fine `80's-`90's live video to use, Warner Video decided to just go cheap and slot in some best-of-Warners clips; they couldn't have spent more than the playing time compiling this. There is nothing here that's worth spending a nickel on, especially for fans who already have ""24 Nights"" or ""Unplugged"".Polygram did a far nicer job - and their's was nothing terrific, mind you - with their ""Cream Of Clapton"" that at least showed some aspect of the history of this performer. This is hardly the ""best of"" 1981-1999, it's no more than VH1 might do with a handful of videos and a half-hour to kill.A wasted opportunity - don't make things worse by wasting your hard-earned money."
3,Disappointing as a DVD,"I'm fairly new to DVD's, so when I bought this one I thought all DVD's took advantage of the superior sound available through the use of dolby digital 5.1, like James Taylor's, Live at the Beacon. This one doesn't it's in stereo. While I love Clapton, I don't HAVE to see him to enjoy him, so if I had it to do all over I'd have bought the CD. At least with the CD, I could have enjoyed his great music in the car as well as at home. So be sure and check what audio format is being utilized BEFORE making your purchase."
4,good value,"One DVD would not (does not) contain Clapton's best. This one comes close. I bought this as an intro to Clapton for my wife. Price is right and she became enamored with him. Call it a ""Starter Clapton"", not the ultimate Clapton. For that go to the Live Clapton DVD's."
2,sociol anthropology,"This book was written my someone who was once initiated into West African Traditional religion and was then told by some Christian Missionary ""Leave your horrible Satan Worship behind and start being a civilized man""! How exciting! Now that Isaiah Oke has indeed embraced Christianity to its fullest, he has nothing better to do then demonize African religion - and of course heavily exaggerated on all of his previous experiences!This book is disgusting not because of its ""gruesome details"" but because it again shows how arrogantly Christianity forces itself upon an already beaten continent. Every student of sociology, cultural history and social anthropology should read this book - not to have their ""eves opened"" on Christianity and ""Vodou"" but to see how cultural changes influence peoples perception and how easily people demonize their culture for promises of a better life ""with God"". A Fascinating study and a disgusting piece of Christian propaganda at the same time!"
5,excellent cd,"stop those bells. damn good song. worth the whole cd. horse i used to ride, if i could sing your blues, maritime are absolutely delicious. bought this on a whim. heard nothing about her before i did. but looking into her other stuff now. fits my moods."
3,Can only be installed by pros,"As a pc enthusiast, but not a professional, I thought I wouldn't have a problem installing this drive. However the drivers are available only on a floppy disk (something that many of us no longer have drives to read), thus this item, however good, is really only intended for professionals who are qualified to configure PC's from the ground-up. Just a word to the wise."
2,Way to General,"All of the accounts were from people that were interviewed for this book in the 90's some by phone. Every interview was way to general. "" I went to this camp for training, then I went to this unit or that unit, we fought the Germans here or there."" Over and over, from different people. I'm sorry but this book was not very good. If your looking for real life detailed accounts of people that were in a Tank Destroyer, this is not the book for you."
5,A War To Win book purchase,"AWESOME!! I received my order today and was totally surprised with how well my book was packaged. I am extremely ecstatic with this seller!! If there's ever a book they have again that I want, I will definitely purchase from this company before anyone else, even if I have to pay more. Thank you!!! Because of this book, I was able to give my husband and his children a part of their history, because the first chapter is my husband's grandfather's story. Thank you once again!!!"
2,The edge peeled off after few months usage,I have this for a while now and it is sturdy and good size for turning especially omelet and pancakes but the edges started to peel off after 3 months of usage. This is not good especially while you are cooking. We tried to scrap it off but it just got worst and we had to throw it away. I am not sure whether there is a better one out there.
2,"Decent, but not very durable","I got 5 months of use out of this spatula. Most of it involved just simple flipping/turning and removing from pans/pots. However, today an entire corner melted/broke off during a routine flipping of a pork chop that I was pan frying. For perspective, I wasn't extra careful about avoiding extra heat, but I wasn't careless either. I never dishwashed it. Occasionally I left it sitting in pans (never for more than ~5 minutes, and never on high heat). Otherwise, the spatula is slightly flexible, but rigid and large enough to hold reasonable amounts of food. The handle doesn't get hot during normal use, nor does it melt on contact with the edge of pans. I never had any trouble getting the edge under anything (though I didn't try more delicate foods like fried eggs). If you're more careful about the heat, you might get a longer use out of it."
1,Just falls apart after a few uses.,I despise this slotted turner as I've owned two. Why I went back to give it a second try is beyond me. It peels easily at the end and soon just starts chipping and falling apart. I just used it too cook scrambled eggs a few time and haven't put it in the dishwasher. Just junk. I don't need black pieces of nylon in my food.

3,Great book!,"This book is awsome! It's all about how Winnie Willis takes on a horse, Bold Beauty to cure of her high jumping problems.Winnie falls off and and becomes terrified of the high hedge. Finally, with the help of God, faces up to her fear and jumps with God riding double!I think Catman likes Winnie!"
4,Nice Story,"I would recommend this book to grades 6+. Also, I would have liked to see more of what happened to Bold Beauty because she was the main reason for the story."
4,Great!,This was a fun book that is great for teens. Gentle is the key word in horse training that you will hear in this book.
4,Great deal,The card that came with the camera was only 16mb and filled very quickly. The 128mb will hold over 100 pictures.
5,Works Perfectly Every Time...,I have owned a couple of these for years and they all work perfectly every time. I can take 100's of high resolution photos without hardly making a dent in the memory usage abilities. I used this card for the last concert I attended and after taking hundreds of photos and over 30 video clips I actually finally filled the card up for the very first time! Awesome product!
3,"My first xD card, but has developed some problems","I bought this xD card back last June, just over a year ago, when I purchased my Olympus D-425. The card has decent capacity at my preferred picture-taking resolution of 1600x1200, but unfortunately it developed some kind of glitch not long after I started using it and at least one or two photos per batch end up getting corrupted so that they can't be downloaded from the camera to my PC. This is not a _major_ problem because it affects only one or two shots out of the whole card's capacity, but I have found that, for instance, Kodak's 256mb xD card is more reliable (as well as being able to hold more shots). I still use this card but only as a backup to the Kodak card, and I'm looking at buying a 1GB card now that prices have dropped so much as I'm going to be attending a big convention next month and expect to take hundreds of pictures there."
5,Fujifilm 128 MB XD Memory Review,"It's a very small ,handy and easy to use memory Card , almost as the same size as a Penny . It's performance is fast during taking the shots and storing them ,Also if you wanna remove some pictures from your XD memory Card ,it's able to delete them in couple of seconds . it's a great memory !"
4,Caution for Olympus Camera Using Fuji xD card!!,"It seems using the Fuji Card on Olympus Camera the ""Panaroma"" feature does not work. I encountered many other options were disabled too."
5,Works great,"Works great so far and the price was reasonable. These types of XD cards are easily confused with a similar XD+ or something similar picture card. I found this brand to be most reliable in the past when it comes to these XD cards, and depending on what day you buy it, you might find a decent price."
5,"best card, best price.","what can I say? The memory card came on time and works great! My original card went nuts and drained the batterys in less than 1 hour even when tuned off. I almost threw the camera away, but I bought a new Fujifilm card and all is well. The camera works like new. Thanks to the great price, I took a chance that paid off handsomely. Amazon comes thru for me again."
2,Very surprised....,"Compared to all the other Baby-G watches I have owned, I feel this one has the poorest and cheapest quality. It is nice and thin though compared to the very first one I bought."
5,"Works great, fits well","I think this will work well to protect my new camera from bumps and scratches. My last digital camera looked pretty sorry after 3 years. It is a little difficult to read the writing in low light, but if you know where your buttons are it doesn' matter too much."
5,everybody loves my neat little camera case,"This is such a great camera case. Snug fit and really protects my SD1000. All of the slots and openings fit great and you can get to the SD card and controls very easy. I call it my ""Batman Camera""."
1,I can't believe you charged me $29.95 postage for a $9.95 item,You people are nuts.I order an add on to my order for a camera and you not only send it seperately but charge me $29.95 postage for a $9.95 item.
4,"Very nice, great price!","I like the feel & fit of this, my only complaint is that it gets in the way of the zoom lever... but a good fingernail allows easy operation. There's a thoughtful plastic insert to cover the monitor screen, but you probably won't want to use it. There aren't instructions on inserting the camera, but it's easy through the opening for the battery/card access. Don't be afraid to stretch the case as needed, the camera slips in with no problem. :)"
5,ed,"A very good product. Works well,lets me have full control of all options that I use on my camera. Gives great added protection to your camera body and screen. I would highly recommend this product and the Amazon seller (Ace Photo Digital) I purchased my case from. Well worth the money."
3,I'm a Star,"I was an extra in this movie filmed at Jungle Jim's Fairfield, Ohio and when I read an article in newspaper I had to buy it."
4,Cada día me gusta más este disco,"I saw Leny at de LaPataia Jazz Tour 2005 in Punta del Este. She is simply great. On the stage she is so warm! It's not only her music, she delivers stories and feelings between songs, in a way I can hardly describe. This CD is a bit different. More ""classic"" perhaps. After I bought the CD I was at first dissapointed, I was looking for something more like the show I had seen. (In fact I had bought another CD more like what I was looking for) However, I must admit I like this one much more every time I listen to it."
3,"Looks nice in the picture, but ...","... the magazine rack itself looks very cheap when assembled (very easy to assemble). There are no little plastic caps on the edges of the metal rod where they stick out and might cut your hand if you weren't careful. But it does its job of holding magazines, etc. with a bright 50s look."
3,Liberal view of religion,"Entertaining and easy to read. You can pick it up and put it down without losing continuity. Each chapter is a separate interview with Smith.Very evocative snippets (e.g., science views humanity from the ground up and religion from the gods down) ... but these don't make up for the utter banality of the overall thinking.Lot's of arguments against scientism, but they are vastly, vastly, vastly inferior to Feyerabend's 'Against Method' arguments as viewed from the side of science.If you're a fan of PBS - Bill Moyers trivializations of religion then you'll love this book. If you're more into the thinking of St. John of the Cross and his 'Ascent of Mount Carmel' then you'll find the arguments in these interviews just plain laughable."
5,The Aces are back with a vengence...,"When the boys disbanded I was heartbroken... The Aces are my favorite band. When I heard they were back, I just had to get this CD. To date, it is my favorite, particularly, Out of The Blue, Love's on the Way, Blue Room, One Love... basically the whole thing! When ever I feel bad, down, or whatever, I put this CD on and immediately things start looking up. Out of The Blue will definitely end up in the ""feel good"" hall of fame! Check out their web site (www.theaces.com) and go see them live if you get a chance!"
4,amazing grace pure and simple,I am a true Ace fan and To Stuffed to Jump has got to be put back on the rack! Or! else!
4,great stuff...but.....help!,"I love the new stuff! I have been a fan since the 70's. Pure music is hard to find. I have looked for months tryihg to replace a ""To Stuffed to Jump"" album. Can anyone help?"
5,Out of the Blue - Buy It!,"I've only lately stumbled onto the Aces via my brother-in-law even though I grew up in the 70's. I remembered Third Rate Romance, but really hadn't heard anything else that rings a bell. I'm kind of happy about that now as in my mid-50's I've found a new music addiction, and its not the old stuff to me, its the new stuff. Out of the Blue is my most recent purchase and I listen to it more or less continuously - all of the albums I bought are great, but this one has some really, really good bluesy country on it - and a lot of Russell Smith. Hard to believe that mainstream radio didn't pick these guys up years ago. 5 Stars for me, highly recommend."
3,God bless the amazing rytum aces,can anyone ouy there turn me on to Burning the ball room down? Released in 1978-- I have to listen to this album again somehow someway .frsawol@aol.com Thank you
4,A Beautiful Homage,"Phil Woods knows his stuff. I confess I don't really agree with what he says about the future of Jazz being linked to latin rythms, but one can't help but appreciate this lovely tribute to the marvelous Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla and the great Brazilian singer Elis Regina. The arrangements are superb and the inclusion of Dizzy Gillespie's ""Con Alma"" sounds appropriate - even if you, like me, think bebop doesn't have that much to do with Astor's and Elis's oeuvres. All the musicians do a terrific job. Phil Woods's playing itself, of course, is beyond repproach. I regret, however, that Mr. Woods chose to present the Astor-related and the Elis-related tunes in ""blocks"" instead of alternating them, which would make the project look (and sound) a whole lot more convincing."
3,California Gardens,"If you are looking for great early photographs of southern California gardens, this is the book to examine. It's narrative content is limited, but we all know how many words a picture is worth. From the transitional to the ecclectic, early gardens in California play host to numerous cultural ideas of regional landscapes. Heavily influenced by Mediterranean formal gardens, there are still other photos representing Spanish settlements of early California, and a few attempts at what I would call Maxfield Parrish-esque fantasies."
5,"Simple, elegant introduction to Thoreau and others","Not a biographical sketch of Thoreau in a typical sense, but in a poetic one. Every word Thoreau wrote was essential, and Robert Bly has selected rich, complex prose selections from ""Walden"" and other writings, along with Thoreau's little-published poetry, to shine light into the soul of one of our most important American writers. Beautifully illustrated with woodcuts, a careful positioning of text on the page - simple, elegant, compelling. Bly's comments on Thoreau's writings and life, and on the contexts in which Thoreau can be seen, provide an excellent structure to his large body of work, and a wonderful guide to further reading. If we had all started our high school readings of Thoreau with this book, there would be no market for the current plethora of books on simplifying life. Our ""Waldens"" would be well-worn. It's all here, simply, beautifully, essentially"
5,Good intro or revisitation to Thoreau's outlooks on life,"Dozens upon dozens of Thoreau quote books have been produced since his death. What makes this one soar above the rest? (a) Robert Bly's choice of selections, (b) his entertaining and insightful commentaries that begin each section, and (c) Michael McCurdy's exquisite woodcuts, suitable for framing. The reviewer for School Library Journal miscounted; nearly 100 prose and poem selections are presented here, illustrated by seven McCurdy woodcuts. Bly approaches Thoreau's writings in five ways, then adds examples of poetry, journal entries, and book excerpts to illustrate his analysis. His fresh approach will resound with ardent Thoreauvians and will encourage newcomers to read deeper into the work.This book was originally published to celebrate the 140th anniversary of Thoreau's retreat to Walden Pond. It would make a great gift to someone who's read only ""Walden."""
1,Poor Craftsmanship,"I didn't realize that there was a problem with the hat until after I gave it to a 91 year WWII veteran. The ribbon bar was crooked and not symmetrical with the lettering above it. This humble veteran was so impressed with the idea that someone recongized his service and he now had a Veterans hat, that he would not relinquish the hat so I could return it for another."
5,pretty good numerical valuations of progress,the onus is on the sales force to perform or close a sale but there was never a mention of how and what methods should the manager employ to keep walk-in traffic flowing.
5,Great disc!,I heard this disc one night and have been TRYING to get my hands on a copy ever since. It's a great compilation of funkdified global mixes. I can't understand why it's so difficult to get! Hopefully it will go into wider release soon - but it's worth getting on the special order list for this gem.
5,LED Lights,"I have mixed feelings about these lights. The do not come with replacement bults, or the LED light themselves if they were to burn out. Every single box that I opened, and I bought 20 boxes, worked, but, every single box was missing 1, 2 or 3 bulb covers that twisted on, or any led replacement bulbs. They are beautiful when lit, and you can plug up to 20 / 70 set lights sets together. That was my selling point! So I bought 1 extra light set, and puled all the lights and bulbs out so I now have enough lights to replace it with the five yeard guarantee that is listed on the box. I spoke with the manufacturing company that produces the product, and the referredme back to the seller. Just beware, the guarantee may ot be honored...but the sure are pretty and bright! I would still recommend these lights for purchase - just remember to get an extra box for parts!"
3,not as advertised,"These lights look nice, except that for all 10 boxes we ordered the colors are different than as pictured on Amazon. The photo for the ""multi colored"" lights shows red, orange, yellow, green and blue. We got red, yellow, white, green & blue. Including white as a color contributes to a much ""cooler"" color overall for the look of the lights. LEDs in general tend to have a cooler light effect; including white emphasizes this. We might have liked them more if the colors had been as advertised.Also, a bulb on one strand was completely missing, several bulbs were loose, and there are no replacement bulbs included. In the future I will buy LEDs in person so I can get a better idea of the correct color by opening the box."
3,OK Product,One light cover was missing out the box but however they worked for me outside in the cold and wet snow! I them kept on for several days without turning them off with no problems besides they're cheap.
1,"Great idea, poor execution",I went LED at a premium price last year with the promise of long life LED's and energy savings. This year I tossed about half of the sets I purchased because of bulb failure. I'm going back (I didn't trash those old bulb sets) to good old and brighter screw in bulbs that have proved the test of time.
1,Faulty lights,I bought eights sets of these lights and six actually worked - wires came out of the plug on one set and the female plug on another string did not work. Not what I was hoping for after paying more for these lights. Going back to the C7 next year.
1,STRING FAILURE AFTER 3 DAYS - FALSE ADVERTISING,"These lights claim to prevent total string failure if a single bulb goes out. This is absolutely false. While they do come with 2 replacement fuses, there are no replacement bulbs and because they are LED, your traditional string light bulbs can't replace them. It all sounds like a minor inconvenience but my tree is now fully decorated and taking off a string of lights or even just adding a new string of lights isn't possible without taking off a majority of the ornaments.I will be returning these strings but their 3 year warranty doesn't mean much when I have to purchase more lights, wait for them to arrive, dismantle my tree, and start all over again.If you do buy these lights, buy an extra string so you have replacement bulbs and invest in a tree light defective bulb detector. You will need them."
4,Excellent Lights,"We have replaced all our old C-9 outdoor tree lights with these lights over the space of 2 years for economic reasons. We had always liked the look of the old fashioned big multi-colored lights outside. We have one large tree we light and these lights, while small C-5 bulbs, have done the trick. They make a nice display and we're waiting to see our electric bill to calculate a savings. For looks, we recommend. Cons: it does take many more strings to make an impact but the effect is good once you get a good number of lights."
5,"Insightful,educating and encompassing","The most insightful and truly honest rememberances of the 20th Century has been written. I looked forward to every new page and story, the photograghy was wonderous... thank you Mr. Evans for the enjoyment and enlightenment you have given me."
4,"Sharp, entertaining and worth the time","Evans did his homework here, and should be quite proud of a work that should have a place in every home. The coffee table book that was credited to Peter Jennings of ABC News may have gotten the fanfare, but this true work of popular scholarship will outlive the hoopla."
4,Very Well Done,"This Book is great for research projects, along with ""The Century"" and ""The Greatest Genneration"""
3,A popular conventional history,"I listened to all books of the series. I found that it was enjoyable to listen to, quite lively and it helped me in filling some gap in my knowledge of history. As such I would recommend it.Having said that I found that overall it is a popular history book of little scholarly value and as many such books it has strong patriotic, ethnocentric and us-centric overtones.if you are looking for an easy to listen to history of the period, especially if you are not very knowledgeable about it, this is a good book for you."
5,'the 'second hundred years',"This book is a fabulous history of life during the American industrial revolution when the 'American dreeam' for many Americans was a 'nightmare.' When 'landgrabs' were the rule and workers had no 'rights.' Only after the Wilson administration did life become more comfortable. It is a chronicle of American History right up to 'modern times.' It makes one realize how much we were NOT taught in school, and how much we may have forgotten. It DOES belong on every American bookshelf!!!"
4,A provocative look at USA in its second Century.,"I like Historical Reference texts and this is quite different - in its analysis of the major events of 1889 through 1989 the second century of the USA. The book makes it quite clear that the ""good old days"" of the late nineteenth century and the first half of this century were filled with social upheaval and injustice as well as great happenings in the development of the Republic. This book was put together from Harold Evan's perspective as an immigrant to the USA and a person who understands how the Constitution creates a tapestry that weaves all the ethnic cultures - and their unique issues and problems - into our national culture. This is an excellent book."
3,Pope John XXiii; a spiritual biography,"A nice overview of the life of John XXiii, but less than an in depth analysis of his life, philospohy, accomplishments, quirks, and the times in which he lived. I found the portion of the book on the convening of the Ecumenical Council and his role in that process lacking. Nor was there much to explain/clarify his successes and problems working with and trying to lead the papal bureaucracy. It was a good overview, but I would love to be able to read a much more in depth biography of the life of John XXiii."
5,I'm already Canadian,So I gave it to a friend who was in need along with a case of Labatts Blue. He immediately stopped being a hoser and flipped on the hockey game. Don't cha know?
5,Helps you learn about Canadians... or make fun of them,"Discover the simple pleasures of trout fishing, snowshoeing, moose (or ""meese,"" as I call them) and maple syrup appreciation--all in a single breath spray. Makes a great gift for friends who are Canadian or who look suspiciously close to being Canadian. (It also helps bump your shopping cart up to $25 free shipping range.)"
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"Like other reviews here on Amazon, the formula has been changed. My cat always loved Petromalt but they changed the formula and my cat won't go near it anymore. I called the company and got an arrogant response saying ""yes"" the formula WAS changed but they couldn't care less. Don't buy this product anymore...it's over!! Called my Vet and they recommended ""Laxatone""....so I bought it at PetCo. It's drips and it's ""gooey"" but my cat will eat it. She likes the formula but it's messy so I put in on her paws....she laps it up. Goodbye, Petromalt!!"
4,"Cat CRIES for it, loves it.","I used to get Nutrimalt (off the market at the moment, unfortunately) for my cat's skin. He LOVED it - it was like crack to him. trying to get him something that he would stop crying for i saw the petromalt and thought the tastes might be similar. took him a couple days to change over - must not taste the same - but now he LOVES the petromalt too. comes and asks for it when i sit where i give it to him with the tube.have noticed less hairballs, which have decreased slowly. skin seems Ok - i would definitely buy again."
2,Counselor intern book,Book has basic information that is already in most counselor text books. Book is not needed for internship.
4,Good resource,I bought this as a required text for a class. It is an valuable source and I use it a lot at my internship site.
4,Beautiful and moving album!,"I enjoyed this album quite a bit; a noticeable improvement in subtely and depth compared to her previous album ""The Raven"" (which I also enjoyed). Some very witty lyrics (her co-lyricist on many numbers is her husband, playwright David Mamet), especially on the opening ""Address to Beams"" and on ""Primitive Man"". I'm looking forward to her next venture!"
1,Certainly not worth paying for.,"This very brief essay on John Bowlby's life and contribution adds nothing whatsoever to what is readily available on the internet at no cost. The research for it could have been done in an hour and there are no original insights.Book jacket material at best.Amazon has much more to offer for your money than such reprints from bottom tier journals. Don't waste your money. Google ""John Bowlby""."
5,Funny,I liked it a lot because it is a funny and quirky indie comedy with a romantic touch...perfect for a date or an evening in front of the TV.
2,Couldn't Make It Through The End,"Low production quality, poor acting, and a terrible script kept me from getting more than 2/3 of the way through this film. I rarely stop watching a movie once I've started, but I found myself considering all the more productive things I could be doing and have very little reason to believe that the last 1/3 can make up for the rest of it. I do enjoy independent films, but this just seems like a B movie all around to me. At points it was funny, but the best jokes suffered from poor delivery, both from the actors and the director. Many of the lines and scenes seemed to drag, with footage that probably should have just been cut. I'd be willing to bet this whole story could have been presented in half the time with no loss of story.The concept is great. I'd love to see a higher budget production with some TLC on the script. I just don't think this was executed well at all."
1,Parents think carefully,"My 9-year-old received this game as a gift. Thinking it was as harmless as the other Sonic game we own, I didn't look closely at the packaging, so I didn't see the E10+ rating on the back. It was only as my 9, 7, and 5-year-olds were playing for the first time that I became alarmed. Every 30 seconds or so, I was hearing swearing. Read the other reviews. This game is not for children, not even older children, if you are as opposed to the use of swear words as I am. The E10+ rating is misleading. This should be rated T. I won't allow my children to play this game because they act out what they play and imitate dialogue. I don't want my 5-year-old saying ""D---"" and it's a sad world when I have to police and screen everything that comes into my home. I definitely don't want my children being as disrespectful as the other children reviewing this game are. From now on I research every game that my children want to get."
1,Shadow the hedgehog,"I am a pretty easy going parent. I was absolutely appalled at the swearing in this game. This game is not appropriate for children. I also listened to the words of the soundtrack of this game and they are horrible. Here is the site to the words.http://www.espiokaos.com/lyrics/sth_lyrics.htmlIt says ""I am evil"" several times and it's difficult to get it out of your head. I just don't think swearing and songs like this should be polluting our children's minds. I do love the sonic games and those seem to have decent lyrics to the sound track. If I would have known all of this I would have never spent the money for my seven year old to have this game. Take the time to look over the lyrics. If you don't mind your child hearing curse words every five seconds. I guess this is the game for you."
1,RACIST,"I am appauled that this game is in the market. The bad language and the ""kill the Black Creatures"" sound bites every 5 seconds is really disturbing. At first I thought I was crazy but I requested other parents to try the game and all of them came to the same conclusion that the game is racist and sends a horrible message. People who vouch for this game must agree with the messages. This christmas gift went straight to trash and the other Sonic games followed."
3,ESRB rated this one wrong,"This game should be rated T. There is no reason for Shadow (and others) to say ""damn"" every 30 seconds in the game. Every time you get hit or die, it cusses. I know we are all getting desensitised to this, but the game should not be rated E10. The violence is pretend and I don't have a problem. Most E10 are due to violence with some obscure language that is hard to hear. With Shadow, ""damn"" is being said every 30 seconds. That's ridiculous. Never before has a Sonic game not been good for everyone. I missed the E10, thought it was only an E. Let my 5 year old play it. I grew up playing Sonic and so has my son. Very unhappy with Sega for this one. No reason for the language and no way to turn it off!"
4,What?!?!?!,"First of all, the game is not racist. The ""black creatures"" are black aliens. Also, do you really think your child WANTS to go around saying (...)every time he gets hit by something? There's something I learned from my parents that a parent-child relationship can be heavily damaged when the parent is proven extremely wrong with something that involves the child.Anyway, Shadow the Hedgehog is a really fun game. It allows you to choose whether you want to do the evil said or the hero side. The guns are a nice touch to a platforming game, and I don't think lock-on is needed. I will agree that (...)was overused. There are many quotes in Shadow the Hedgehog that get extremely annoying, too.But, please parents. Realize what you are doing to your kids. You're hurting them as much as the videogame hurts you."
5,Emotional and Sexual Passion,"I just finished reading DARK TORMENT, my first Karen Robards novel and it was so satifying, that I've already ordered a second one. The protagonists, Dominic, a handsome, mysterious and confined stranger, and Sarah, an Austrailian sheep farmer's very plain daughter, meet under the most brutal of circumstances. They show an outward disdain for each other while inwardly they burn with passion. In addition to romance and very descriptive sexual content, this novel is filled with life-and-death adventures. Karen Robards could easily become a romance lover's favorite writer."
5,One of my favorite Robards books,"I love this book. Dominic and Miss Sarah are a lot of fun to read about. She's so stuck up and prissy, and of course, he just can't help driving her crazy.She saves his life when he's going to get whipped to death for being a trouble making prisoner on a ship bound for Australia. Instead, she buys him for her father's station. She goes on to boss him around and drive him crazy, while he does everything he can to annoy her and get under her skin.There's lots of action and adventure, revenge-minded criminals, evil step mothers and a secret inheritance, and all the ingredients for a great historical romance novel, IMO.Most importantly, the couple is sexy. There's one scene I love where her hair falls out of its pins and he asks her to leave it down. The guy is a charmer, for sure. The whole time I was reading the book, I kept thinking, ""Go for it, Sarah!"""
3,3 1/2 stars,"I was disappointed because I had somewhat high hopes for this book. Reading the back of the book the plot line immediately grabbed my eye - but I felt somewhat disappointed with how she carried it out. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it - it was cute, and the characters are engaging. But I feel like it could have been cut down by like 100 pgs. Not to mention I'm so sick of heroines who are constantly called ugly and then somehow become pretty by just changing their hair - even the hero calls her ""plain"" to himself NUMEROUS times - then later insists she is beautiful. I wouldn't say it wasn't worth reading, but nothing special..."
4,"Sexy, sensual, sultry romance","If you're looking for romance, Ms. Robards is your author. In Dark Torment, the author gives you an irresistable protagonist--no one appreciates her inner and outer beauty except the outcast Dominic. This novels explores the change of Sarah from an obedient daughter to a sensual woman. Of course, this novel contains explicit sex--in three words, it is hot. Definitely worth taking with you on a weekend getaway"
5,Absolutely wonderful.........you'll love it.,"The Australian outback lents itself beautifully to this tale of a wrongly accused/convicted man who escapes death by becoming indentured to a sheep grower. His plain, no-nonsense daughters saves the convict ""gallagher""'s life. He resents her for it as he doesn't want to be ""beholden"" to anyone esp a woman. The overseer wants to marry 'sarah' for her inheritance and makes every effort to beat and kill Gallagher once he sees that Sarahbefriends the man. Filled with adventure and action, love and hate, ruthlessness and tenderness and all the emotions in between, this is really enjoyable. You come to love gallagher and his sapphire eyes and hope he and sarah find the love they both deserve despite the obstacles. It was hard to put down and I was sorry when it was over."
2,An unproven conjecture,"The author rightly points out that the main biographies of Hitler portray him as an ""unperson"" with no real personality beyond a political facade. I agree that this could not possibly be correct. The author then tries to show that Hitler was either homosexual or had homoerotic tendencies. The evidence presented is suggestive but not at all convincing. We are left not knowing. The book is of value in pointing out that Hitler regarded homosexuality as a private affair that should not be of concern to the state. His stance, at least in public, only changed when it became politically expedient for him to change it."
1,"If you assume enough, anything is possible.","Early in the book, this author leaves the well-travelled world of historical research to delve into the world of speculation.Throughout the book, the author asks the reader to assume this or that was true, and builds a shakey ""proof"" of Hitler's homosexuality based upon a host of assumptions.This is not scientific historical research in any way. If I want to suspend my disbelief, I read fiction. History books should be based upon truth or reasonably provable facts - at a minimum something that happened this recently should have first person accounts. The author brings no eyewitnesses or documentation forward to support his claims.In short, this _novel_ is not worthy of a reader's time."
2,hidden hitler,"Rumors about the Fuhrer,s sex life abound (see THE SEX LIVES OFTHE GREAT DICATATORS). During his speeches to admiring crowds, whose grandchildren now cheer Michael Jackson, Hitler alwaysclasped his hands in front of his crotch giving rise to storiesthat he was hiding the last unemployed person in the Third Reich.This book by a German Herr Professor, with his head in the cloudsand his mind on matters below the waist, claims that Hitler was ofjoyful persuasion. As most books written by the academics ismostly boring guesswork but there is a tanalizingly cryptic remarks in Hitler,s diary for l943....invade USA, meet Cesar Romero."
1,this book is nonsense,"Well is it interesting to note some fellow found out that Hitler was a homosexual after almost 50 years of his death...Hitler is a topic of research..he has to understood and not make movies and write books for comercial purpose....i have been reading books on hitler for the past 10years and I think he has a much deeper personality that this book presents.....give the people facts and not your judgements..let the people judge themselves...read mein kampf......i cant read German so I dont think that even its translation gives the exact facts....try to read Mein Kampf and judge with common sense and your ""BRAIN"".....and see the personality of Hitler...it is a boring book no doubt but if u want to know Hitler read Mein kampf..."
3,Poor picture and description,"I ordered this expecting 3 bags of coffee as in the picture. Unfortunately, I didn't read it close enough and it's only 1 bag of coffee and it's whole bean, which isn't stated anywhere."
2,Coffee,"What was advertized as pure Kona coffee was a blend with less than 20% Kona Beans. It wasn't worth the purchase, unfortunately. I'm sure Food and Wine tasted different coffee."
5,To Asmara,"It is a novel that shades light on Eritrea's struggle for independence.well spiced and depicts the emotions,cultural,social and unrelenting commitment for freedom by all Eritreans no matter which sector of social class they come from.My children are US born.It will help them look into the foreign perspectiv."
3,atypical keneally,"Written in a more journalistic style than his later works, this book chronicles a newspaper reporter through his journey into rebel Eritrea before its independence. The reporter, and Keneally, are so smitten with the cause and the people that he cannot see objectively that he is being spoon-fed the revolution very carefully. It does a good job of exposing the Amharic tyranny over other tribes in East Africa, courtesy of Haile Selassie then Mengistu, but it seems a bit dated now that Eritrea has been recognized by the UN and Ethiopia as well. The political manipulation of food as aid still persists, however, and this book dramatizes that situation well, with a bit of Anne Tyler-esque marital dissolution thrown in for ""personal growth""."
5,ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!!,"I cannot find words to come close to describing how fabulous this CD; this group; this music is! The melodies of Dave Cantor are beautiful. Coupled with kinky lyrics or incredibly intelligent lyrics or just plain fun lyrics - everything works! And Kelly Flint's voice. Cool and sultry. And, great sound. Ballads like Stormy, Nirvana, and Crazy, reach into the depths of one's feelings, explore taboo thoughts, mine deep human emotions - and do it all within the framework of sophisticated and haunting melodies. There is not a weak link to this music.And where and how did I find this absolute gem? In an out of the way cut-out bin in a record shop in, of all places, Tokyo! Let's hope that some hip Japanese are enjoying this now, as I have been since the day I found it.This is GREAT MUSIC! Get this and the other 2 DTS disk's - NOW!!!"
1,Not unless you use rubberbands!,Had this for 4 weeks and had to use an hammer and allen wrench to tighten the arm so it would not swing with the meerest tilt. Even after that it still swung over and the little flash holder piece broke. Unless You like the idea and intend to use rubber bands on the end to hold it down... not a good choice!
3,Monster,"wright at the begining things start too get mest up with mary and the kids at the party but if you ceap on reading it starts to make sense and it really caut my eye win mary was in the cop stashion and she starts telling angela about why she killed jim and kathey and it starts to make sense and the story just fales into place how the three kids todd,jim,and kathey can left like a ton of weight and how they stay of to there selfs and in practice cant be stoped on the football feild. then the bar and the aboundend wearhouse the three kids trick two couples to go in and have a party but in a few houers and then todd,jim,and kathey come out with bags on there back just big enough to carey some colthes and win mary goes in she see's huge circles on the foloer and just a littel bit of boold on the foloer but win she comes back later some won had cleaned the place.Then angela starts to belave what mary is saying and start to see what is going on.Written by seth o"
3,My thoughts on 'Monster'...,"I read this book years ago, when I was still in middle school. At the time, it was the first Pike novel I had read, and the reason I continued to read his work. Re-reading it again years later (I'm 29 now), I enjoyed it almost as much as I did the first time...almost.The book starts off with a bang, and continues at a quick pace until the end. Unlike most of his other YA books, it stays on a mostly linear course as the main protagonist investigates why her best friend would suddenly murder two people without warning. But unlike most of his YA books, unfortunately, this book doesn't often stray from the simple plot: that her friends are becoming cannibalistic monsters.Good for a quick, enjoyable read on a day off, but not really thought provoking. And if you are a fan of The Season Of Passage, you'll most likely find this to be the watered down teenage version, with Mary replacing the role of Terry."
5,Memorable after all these years,"""Monster"" was the first book I ever read by Christopher Pike. I was about 12 years old and I still remember how the mystery in the story pulled me in right from the start. After that, I read every other Christopher Pike book I could find in my school library. His stories are spooky, mysterious, romantic, exciting and I loved feeling like I was there with the characters in the stories. I'm 28 now and I still recall this book and the others very well, not bad. :)"
4,Scary!!!,Mary comes to a party and shoot two persons with a shotgun and now she's after her boyfriend. Everyone think she's mad when she claims that the ones she shot were Mosters. But if she's right?This was the first book I read by Mr Pike and I it got me stuck. Please read it and you won't be disappointed.
3,Johnny use2b Guitar Watson,Johnny what happen to your guitar skills. Also was he on speed. He was not relaxed or calm in this video. He came across as lame and goofy. His guitar skills has demenished tremendously but his music and songs will always be great. Johnny had a period in history wher his music took second place to no one and I mean no one. Its a shame we don't have any of his live concerts when he was not mentally compromised and old. Buy it for your collection and to show repsect to a legend but be aware that Johnny will not be at his best.
5,Excellent Book,This book is excellent. It gives a lot of detail and pictures of how to learn handling starting with a little pup. I would definitely recommend this book.
4,Repetitious,A very basic book - which is what I wanted. It contained hopefully all the information I need not to make a fool of myself in the conformation ring. In spots it was repetitive and unnecessarily verbose.
2,Hip-hop classical Cuban Son,"There was only one song on this cd that was concerned a Son, it is when Mayito turns the place out, singing ""Dancing Negroes"". Otherwise, I was very disappointed with this live composition."
4,Great air filter,"I am very happy with this HEPA filter. I have it in a bedroom which is slightly larger than the recommended size but it still gets rid of all the dust. I run it on low all the time and it is just enough white noise that it is not a problem for sleeping. Medium and high are somewhat loud, but the low setting makes a huge difference in air quality so low is all that is needed. It did have a slight plastic or carbon type smell but that went away after a week. Filters are a little bit expensive but it is worth it when you see all the dust it catches on the carbon pre filter and I think I sleep better now. This is the best air purifier I have owned out of 3 tries with other brands."
2,Noisy and died a premature death ...,"3 speeds but don't expect to have a conversation or listen to the TV on anything but the lowest speed .. the good news is that the noise stopped suddenly, just about a year after purchasing the product (of course it doesn't work anymore either). To be fair, I can't find the model number on my unit but it looks pretty much like this one. If not, maybe an earlier version but they also sound the same based on the description."
1,Learn Bulgarian ???,"I have used books to learn 2 foreign languages, Spanish, Italian and a little Dutch all with sucess. I find this book absolutely useless, you need to know some bulgarian to start with and then it teaches you a bunch of useless phases which are only useful in a particular situation. There is also no [english sounds] pronounciation guide with the Bulgarian words, so advance knowledge of the alphabet and phonetics are needed. A complete waste of time and money."
2,not much airflow,"Compared to other hair dryers I've used, this doesn't put out enough airflow, even when using the nozzle. It gets plenty hot and the outlet saver plug is nice, but I'd gladly trade it for MORE AIR."
4,Very well done!,"Stolen Wishes has it all: a good plot, likeable characters, a very bad guy and wonderful messages about healing and tolerance. Mary and Shane are good for each other and with each other. The references to Robin Hood are delightful and gave a fairy tale quality to what, in lesser hands, might have been a hum-drum western. I would have preferred a bit more romantic tension between the two characters, but I liked it too much to quibble. All in all, a wonderfully done tale!"
1,"$45 for ""Use the colors black, white, and red.""","Black says that a core group of anti-establishment web pioneers and techies hate him because he uses his successful techniques from the world of print. I say he sounds like he's got delusions of grandeur and he may need professional help.I wanted a book that has interesting content and good design suggestions. The other (negative) reviews here are pretty much correct - not much here at best, at worst we see a tremendous ego and standard ""internet visionary"" garbage.Stay away. Stay far away."
3,"Excellent Printing on fine paper...content?,,what content?",Overall the book lacked the necessary detail to the technical process in creating a site. It seemed that Roger was too self contained to really help his reader. I enjoyed flipping the pages and thought the book was a beautiful example of printing. I wish the content was less self expression and more useful content.
2,Sell It!!!,"I agree with the well spoken critics. Not much substance to the self promo book. However I would purchase the book from any of them...for about $12.00. It would look good on my coffee table, right next to a couple of David Carson's books. I'm Serious."
2,Pure pandering.,"Wow. If anyone can challenge David Siegel's ego, here's the guy. With a book of common sense layout information and self-glorification, this book is little more than a 240 page commercial for Roger Black. The book strays into layout principles that have nothing to do with the Web. For the purpose of contrast I could understand, but a whole book about it? Please. I'll save you some time.. ""Be brief. Use limited colors and fonts. Make things big."" There. That's the book. I got this book through promotional channels and paid nothing for it. I'm still out too much. Just another big, glossy, square book about the Web."
3,a self-indulgent book,"I first ran across the Web page for this.That site is good. Quite good. I'd never heardof Roger Black, but it prompted me to order thebook. My best description for it is self-indulgent and over-priced for what it delivers. At $19.95 I might rate it a 6 or 7.There are 10 large pictures of Mr. Black. Thebook ends with a 27-page ""visual biography"" ofhis work, mostly in traditional print media.If you've seen Lynda Weinman's books or DavidSiegel's ""Killer Web Sites,"" then you should look at someone else's copy of this before you buy, to see if the title and contents live up to your expectations. This is probably a better purchase for a library than for an individual -- a book to look through once, but not to have at hand in your workspace."
2,Web Books that Work,"This book is not for individuals who are looking for a hands-on how-to book for web site development. This book focuses mostly on theory rather than practical aplication. As a web developer who makes his living in this medium, I found the book to be less than awe inspiring."
1,Ever so artsy-fartsy...,"There may be some good information in this book, but you'll have to wade through a lot of photographs of the author to find it."
2,Book Design That Works,"The only reason that I haven't given this book back to Amazon is because I want to keep it as a reference for good PRINT design -- not web design.Web Sites That Work would better serve the graphic design community as a reference for good book and magazine design rather than web design.Throughout the book I got the impression that Roger Black wasn't actually creating Web Sites... He was really making MAGAZINE COVERS, throwing in some URL links and then posting them on the net disguised as web sites.The book is beautiful... that's about the only reason you should buy it."
2,One Trick Pony,"Yes, this is a 240 page ad for Roger Black and his agency. (..""a voice that MUST BE HEARD.."" puleeze.) But he makes an interesting case for a more ""editorial"" approach to content and splash pages. But then again, why wouldn't he- he's a magazine guy... Worth buying for a group and arguing over the topics. Sample discussion: "" Did any of you guys understand why Black included that section on typography?"" or- ""which photo of his agency/him did you like best?"" Sorry Roger. _User Interface Engineering's Website Usability: A Designer's Guide(1997)_, proves most of your ""cutting edge"" theories to be quite flawed."
3,Not worth the Money,"Though a beautiful book, it's not worth the price tag. The book goes through Mr. Black's career as a designer, both for magazines and web pages. The ""web sites that work"" are only Mr. Black's. He does not go over other web pages outside his company except to show those that do not work. Some beautiful glossy pages and pictures give you a lot of ideas for your own pages, but that can probably be found elsewhere as well. There is almost no technical information here, just a lot of glossy pictures."
4,I give credit to the title - It made me buy the book,"The title was deceiving at first, but it did what it had to do and lead me to reading it.(one of the books teachings) So the title served its purpose whether we took the time to review it before we bought is our problem. (I am guilty of that) The book is good. Yes at first he bombard you with print ads and non web material but then if you read deeper into the book and think about it web design, like any other media is about communication. He does something important and presents a history of printed visual communication methods. The examples that he presents have worked. He does a good job applying these principles to web design. It's a good start for those non-designers and non-artist who want to be web designers. Good design and a simplicity, its all about communication."
4,David Siegel should read this book!,"Ok so the content is not there in depth and boredom, you don't get patronised about how Siegel 'invented' the one-pixel gif trick, there's no bollocks about third generation sites being the way to go just because the author decided on the principle... But hey, who needs that crap. Here's a book about web sites, web site design and layout and content. Some good bits, some bad bits.. but mostly a fun read. A light read. It doesn't patronise. It's in interview style. As a whole book it works but it doesn't really say much. But then it doesn't talk the same old boring hat that the other two notable web design authors babble on about at length. Buy it, it's different, it's fun, it's for your coffee table. Ignore the crap reviews here - those people probably like being babbled at rather than talked to."
3,"Red, White and Black","Although this book is self congratulatory and its content puddle deep you gotta give Mr. Black credit for starting a not unappealing trend: The holy color trilogy espoused by Black (red, white & black) is now plastered all over whichever media one cares to look. I've had an enormous amount of fun watching this trend unfold, all the while knowing the source: Roger Black's ""Web Sites That Work""."
4,Excellent Overview,I liked this book as an interesting commentary of design issues and where the web is going - It makes interesting reading and gives you something to look at. Its rare to find a book that looks at web design issues.
2,"Lots of flash, mostly trash","Although this book is very pretty with lots of ink, thick pages, and nice graphics, I thought that the information value was very low. All of the information that was worth anything could have fit in a magazine article. This book seems to be a ""look how cool Roger Black is"" book, and it even has a little section in the back all about Roger Black, in case you didn't catch it from the rest of the book. Roger Black's Web work is very nice, so he has a lot to brag about, but this book should not have been the way to go about it. Although his Web design may work for certain audiences, there's much more to it than this very opinionated (and limited) version. He should stick to magazine design. Don't waste your money. This book is not only over-priced because of the flashy presentation, but it's not even worth the content."
3,"It's ok, but if you want the best get....","It's ok, Roger definetly has some knowledge. The best information comes from Jakob Nielsen, check out his site useit.com and his books to design successful, user-friendly, and attractive sites."
1,Wish I'd read these reviews before buying this book...,"All Black talks about is himself, his organizations, his work, and his beliefs. As insteresting as some of those are, this book gives a very poor overview of what makes a good web site, and fails to feature a wide array of design styles and site examples. Reads like one long Black advertisement."
1,Web sites that Roger designed,"Not to take anything away from Roger Black - he has designed some very aesthetically pleasing web sites - but what was this book supposed to be about? Certainly it gave great insight into his mind and methodology, but that is all it gave. To read it you would believe that he is the only designer out there, and that Red and Black (although nice) is the only acceptable color palette.Also, if this is a testemant to effective content organization, why was I constantly flipping back and forth between incongruous pages and superfluous magazine designs from the sixties? Yeah this guy had a great career, but that's not why I bought the book.And another thing - this book is the definition of overly designed. Is that to make up for the lack of content? Were all the saturated glossy pages supposed to make us think that our money was well spent on this self-serving egomaniac?Save your money, this book isn't worth it."
1,Why is there no negative star rating? Take his points away!,"What Black has to say about web-design in this book would fit onto a single 640x480 screen in 72 point bold. He fills a book with pictures of his shaven head, repeats pictures of his own sites, and strangely, since the cover claims he wrote the book himself, quotes himself in the form ""Black says"". I read the book in a library, and would want to go to his office if I had paid the $45 cover price. Black no doubt sees this as controversy, but the guy is a pseud, and it seems from what he says in his book that others do all the design work anyway. Don't pay for this advert for Black's company and Adobe. Boycott the man, the publisher and maybe stop even looking at the web, for if this is the future of web design then we will only be seeing self congratulatory web sites in black and white and red with big serif fonts."
1,The only thing Black espouses is himself.,"In response to the reader from Frederick, Maryland (Below), Black espouses himself throughout much of what amounts to a printed commercial.I thought I was buying a book that was packed with knowledge and tips on making a 'web site that works' but instead got a cheesy autobiography with the design history of several magazines, some very short lessons in typography, and tons of pictures of this Roger Guy. (How about putting in some more pics of websites that work instead?)I believe that Black Really wanted to write an autobiogrophy about himself, but realized that no one would buy it, so he disguised it as a seemingly helpful book hoping to make some money.Roger, I have nothing personal against you, but you cost me 40 bucks to listen to you talk about yourself and I'm not happy. Do us a favor and make your next revision more about 'Web Pages That Work' and less about the 'Life and Accomplishments of Roger Black: Lord and Inspiration of the Magazine Industry'."
2,Must've gone to press without a proofreader,"I have a bit of a problem with Roger Black, in regards to his ego versus the repetitive nature of his work. I like his clean designs, but this is a guy who never tries anything new. He's been lucky to make a career of it. With this book, he seems to officially be resting on his laurels. Not much effort here except on the printer's part. Glad I didn't pay full price for this multi-page ""gee, look at me"" self-promo piece for Mr. Black. But my big problem is that...WHO PROOFREAD this thing? there are phrases that repeat over and over, multiple spellings of certain words and phrases, typos, and just plain misspellings. ""Kristy Brinkley""? ""Adobe After Affects?"" There's dozens of them. Hmmm. Seems like it was rushed out with not much integrity. Mr. Black, if it's got your name on it, and you are the perfectionist you seem to be, then find a better proofreader--or do it yourself. It's embarrassing. Oh, and I double-dog dare you to NOT use red in a design."
5,Great Paint By Numbers Set,"Unlike sets purchased at local arts and crafts box stores, this set was quality. The paint made the difference-opaque. Shipped timely too. Thanks!"
3,Art Work,This was bought for the 13 year old granddaughter to try-but it is a little too difficult. The paints provided all must be mixed into other colors to paint with.
3,Regal Tiger PNB,The product itself was fine and accomplished what it's original purpose was. But this lists the product as a 20x16 and it was much smaller. I was pretty upset that theipping cost more than the product.
4,Sunflowers,"I rate the Sunflowers almost as high as the Pansies.The colors are toobright for my liking. It also is intricate and takes patience to paintit correctly. I have been requested to paint this for others. I enjoyedpainting it because it was a challenge. Once again I can't speak highenough about Dimensions. I have recently purchased three more of theirpaintings. I am 79 years old and enjoy the concentration it takes topaint all of Dimensions' ""works""."
5,paint-by-number still life,I love paint-by-number projects. I actually frame them and hang them up. This is a pretty still life - hours of relaxation. Put on music and daub away. Have no natural skill as artest - so this makes me happy.
3,"""Antiques"" paint by number",I haven't started the painting yet but feel I should write a review on the condition of the package. The painting itself arrived curved. I don't know how to unbend it without breaking the board. So it will be interesting painting on a curved board. There was also very little instruction and one paint brush is certainly not enough.
5,nice paint by number,nice picture but much too hard for my 10 year old daughter to paint alone. Many small detailed areas. thanks!
4,Heirloom Roses,"Just finished this painting and it came out really nice. However, the consistency of the paint is not all the same so if you look closer the painting appears blob-like in some spots. The person who received it really likes it though :)"
5,21st Century Discipline,"As a Alternative School Principal I find this work invaluable for inservicing our staff.I have High Schoolers, Middle Schoolers and Elementary students in a separate location.Discipline has changed as have the students and this conceptually fits the students.Excellent work for secondary school discipline.Being a Wm. Glasser, M. D. desciple it fits well with what I feel needs to be done with kids today.Harry A. McBain"
5,"""just"" a mass-market, drugstore chocolate, but excellent!","These dark chocolate truffles by Lindt are not hand-made by a chocolatier, and no doubt have ingredients to give them a longer shelf-life. But so does Godiva, Ghirardelli, and the other major brands.These truffles have an incredibly smooth, intensely chocolate center, just enough sweetness without bitterness, that makes even just one or two pieces very satisfying. Not to mention affordable! Pretty blue wrapping for holidays, including Chanukah."
4,"Delicious, but more like milk chocolate than ""dark.""","These are delicious, no doubt about it! However, they taste more like a cross between milk chocolate and dark... I realized immediately upon eating the first one that I should have bought the ""60% Extra Dark"" version of this product (they are wrapped with black foil, not blue). If you want a taste that is more middle-of-the-road, then go with these, but if you want that dark chocolate richness and ""edge,"" go with the Extra Dark."
3,"A fun adventure, but no classic","Star Risk, Ltd. reminds me of a print version of the excellent anime series Cowboy Bebop - only not as cool. From the beginning the reader should abandon all thoughts of a hard science fiction story and get ready for something more akin to a wild west tale set in the Star Wars universe. This is science fantasy, but that's not to say it fails to entertain. There are more than a few chuckles and memorable scenes in this book, and it would be great for passing the time on a plane flight or long road trip. Pick up Star Risk, Ltd. if you don't want to *think* too hard about your sci-fi reading for once."
3,Entertaining and an easy read,"This is my first time reading a Chris Bunch novel and I think I was expecting it to be more along the lines of the standard sci-fi military novel. Instead what I took away from it was more light-hearted humorous action. The dialog is typical of when military/ex-military friends get together and rag on each other and to be honest I wish there was more of that.Imagine a typical action movie with the bad one-liners that seem to go with those along with those and add some sexual banter than never seems to come to fruition. Those type of movies aren't the most intellectually stimulating and they'll never get drama of the year but they are entertaining none the less. Same here. So throw some music on (I suggest old Rolling Stones tunes for this one) and curl up and enjoy . . . it'll be over before you know it, so you might as well go pick up the rest of the series. I'm starting on book 2 in a moment myself.(...)"
3,Star Risk Ltd.,"A nice read. Somewhat in the style of E.E. Smith whom I really like. This is NOT a heavy, deep thought required, read; however, I found it an enjoyable book. I like the mix of characters."
4,Invaluable as a practical guide for undertanding the Dutch,"This book was recommended to me by the Director of Cultural Affairs at a foreign embassy in the Hague as the best book available for understanding contemporary Dutch society. It's informal yet thorough, clearly written, and eminently practical. Neither academic nor touristic, the book is ideal for people from a foreign country who are moving to the Netherlands or will be spending a good quantity of time there. I bought my copy in the Netherlands at Veenstra Bookhandel in Amsterdam."
5,Ghosts Who Went To School,"I read this story as a child, probably 25 years ago, and am happy to be able to share it with my son now. It really is a great book."
5,"THIS is the flat iron to get, hands down!","I had one of the OLD flat irons from when they first came out, was awful. Started looking for a new one after trying my niece's (hers was about $135!!) I didn't want to pay that much, and then I saw this one and saw all of the GREAT feedback from customers. They aren't kidding. Not only does this product work fantastically, it's CHEAP! I was on the phone when this arrived and I couldn't wait to try it. I kid you not, I did my hair with ONE HAND! This thing is AMAZING!!! I also think it's great cuz the plates don't go to the edge, so, no burning yourself, and it had a large selection of heat settings so you don't burn your hair. I did my whole head in less than 5 minutes....probably about 3, and that's one-handed, lol! This is an amazing product that lives up to all that it promises. If you're in the market for one of these, this is the one to get."
3,It's alright.,"I was surprised when I saw the price & the other reviews convinced me, so I bought it. I was used to my old $100 straightener, so I guess I had more expectations, but overall, this product is pretty good. It gets the job done, but obviously not as good as a straightener that is more expensive. However, it works & I like it."
1,Regret buying this item,"I bought this flat iron because of it's good reviews, so I thought it only fair to make sure people know that it is not a good iron. After only a few uses, the ceramic on the fake ceramic plates is coming off. Soon there will be none left. Because of this, the plates now tug and pull on m hair, making it very painful to straighten. It also makes the end of my hair VERY frizzy. Save your money and buy a nice flat iron that will last you years instead of a few weeks."
2,"Works great, but plates quickly wore out.","Can't beat the price, but I guess in the long run, you do get what you pay for. This iron works great, just as good as the high priced brands, however, it doesn't last very long as the gold plating wears off quick ( about 5 uses) and then it started to frizz the hair and with each use it became less effective."
3,You get what you pay for,"It's an ok flat iron for the price and it does have some perks that you won't get with many other flat irons in this price range, but it doesn't last very long. If you don't really flat iron more than once in a blue moon, then this would be ok, but if you plan on using it more than 1x a month, spend a little more to get a better iron.Pros- heats up quickly- swivel cord- simple swivel button allows for easy closure- temperature control- really light and comfortable to useCons- plating wears off pretty quickly. I had it for about 5 months, used it on average every two weeks and ALWAYS btw 5 and 10 for the heat setting (around 200F) so I was expecting it to last a bit longer since the plates weren't super hot and I wasn't using it more than 2/3 times a month. Now the plating has started to wear off so I just bought a flat iron with 100% ceramic plates instead of a ceramic coated one.- the lights don't work the way they're supposed to- the temp may fluctuate while using it"
4,You need to buy this,this is a great flat iron. I bought it yesterday at walmart for about $15.48. You cant beat the price. It gets my african american hair straight and it can even do flips and curls.However the reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it is really ceramic coated not ceramic plated. And after one use some of the ceramic paint rubbed off. But other than that this is a great flat iron. It gets really hot and it heats up quick.
4,Fairly good straightener,"I like this because it was pretty inexpensive and does a fairly good job. I have pretty straight hair to begin with so I didn't need a serious straightener; just something to calm my hair down when it was doing something I didn't like. One thing that bothers me is that every once in a while, my hair will get caught between the ceramic plate and the plastic and it pulls my hair out. OUCH!"
1,This product is not so good for me,"It is not so useful, I bought it on March, but I don't use it frequently. Guess what, it is broken, I have no idea how it is broken because I remember I used it on Tuesday, but today, two days later, it doesn't work. I wonder why or how can I fix it? Can I return it? haha"
2,Not impressed.,"I got this straightener last week. After using it a few days I've decided to return it. It does not keep its heat consistently and I have to wait after straightening a section to let it heat up again. Not only that it seems to fry my hair noticeably. I didn't have that problem with my previous ceramic straightener. I've decided to replace this one with theHSI 1"" CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER Free Bio Silk Samplestraightener as it had many excellent reviews. I don't usually review products but I wanted to give my experience with this iron for those looking for a new one."
2,A little too rough,"The plates are not quite smooth enough for my very curly hair. I am sticking with my chi (I was looking for a straightener with an auto shut off and discovered the newer version of the chi that now has one. I switched to it, and it is easier on my hair (doesn't catch at all whereas this one does a little)."
2,disappointed!,"I don't like it at all-it makes my hair dull, dry and fuzzy. I am really disappointed. My mistake was that I assumed that a flat iron could not possibly do a bad job and the price and brand dont matter, but obviously I was wrong. It's worth its price. I didnt return it, because shipping is almost half the price of the flat iron."
2,Andis Flat Iron,"I bought this flat iron a couple months ago and it doesn't work as good as i thought it would , the flat iron pulls my hair and it takes me longer to get it straight so i recommend to look for better flat irons i hope this review helps . (:"
5,Plancha de cabello,"Lo compre como regalo para mi esposa y le encanto. Es potente, rápido y no daña el cabello. Lo recomiendo."
3,"its ok, not great!","i wouldnt be so crazy about this item , its just ok, kind of cheap, so you are getting what you paid, it doesnt go smooth on hair, but it does make them straight, the reason why i got this one i had expensive ones before, they work nicer but they didnt last me a year,they broke..so i decided why would i pay so much if still it doesnt last. but the difference in cheap model and expensive one is pretty big, so if you use them a lot just get more expensive model, this one is still maid pretty cheap. and have it on very low setting its getting hot fast!!!"
3,"It's good, but","It's good, but the outer surface is very hot and is not coveredCoating to protect the hands from the heat, but generally very good"
4,Nice,I like this flat iron. The only thing I would say is that it takes a little longer than I'd like to straighten my bangs. I think that's cuz of the bigger size of the 1.5 inch plates. Still like it though. It gets really hot.
4,Fantastic :),"I love this flat iron! I used it nearly every day and its lasted sooo long. It heats up really fast and does an excellent job. After about a year, the gold on the plating begins to fade and come off though. Its lasted longer than ANY flat it\ron Ive had before wich is nice. Its now been like 2 years and it makes a buzzing noise when I plug it in now. but still I recomend this :)"
5,Really good!,"This item was delivered in 2 days after I ordered. This is a really good hair straightener compared to the previous ones that I have used. It gets hot really fast, in 1 minutes after I switch it on. The hair looks straight throughout the entire day. Also, it is very light and easy to hold."
3,My opinion on andis flat iron,"Hi guys! Well, my sister warned me but I was in need of a cheap flat iron and needed it quick. So, it straightens well of course your first time, but then the ceramic starts to peel as if it was just a ""coat"" of it instead of fully ceramic which if you have natural hair like me it wouldnt be a good thing because it damages your hair, but of course if you're just looking for something quick then this is the way to go!"
5,Five years and still great,"Bought it back in 05, after a sales person at walmart saw i was going to purchase a $100, and recommended this one. It has worked great. Too bad i left it behind on my last trip."
2,Not as great as I read,"I have think and curly hair. I bought this item because of the reviews I saw. This straightener does not straighten my hair completely. It looks a bit frizzy. It has actually damaged my hair alot. Not only that, but the ceramic has come off the plates. The plates are not turning a metal color. I was not impressed with this product."
5,Fantastic for the price!,"I have been buying these flat irons for about 6 years now, and considering the price, you probably won't get any better.I am an african-american with natural hair that is different textures in different spots. This flat iron straightens my hair just as well as the expensive flat irons that are used at salons. It heats up very well and doesn't take a thousand passes to straighten the hair.My only complaints are that over time it does seem to wear out, and since the plates are ceramic coated instead of completely ceramic, the coating does wear off. However, if you clean the flat iron after each use it does seem to hold up longer.But for $20 bucks, you really can't complain at all."
5,A must have!,"I just love this product. For me, it has deleted my use for the traditional curling iron. It doesn't take long to heat up or cool off!"
4,Flat Iron,"Love it, just wish I'd have bought the 2"". Works much better then the conair product that I previously had. No groove to snag and pull your hair."
1,Very disappointed. (With update),"I read all these great reviews on this straightener, and so I was very excited and optimistic when I went to buy my Andis flat iron from Walmart. A week later, it was broken, wouldn't turn on. I thought that this would last me years, so I didn't keep the receipt. I feel like I just flushed $16 down the toilet. I didn't throw it in the sink or anything hardcore, just used it twice and kept it in my bathroom and it broke. I'm pretty disappointed with this product.UPDATE: Bought another one of these products, and it works great. I guess the first one I bought had a faulty electrical cord or something of the sort."
2,Probably nice - if it worked,"I bought this because my straightener of five years is, well, in need of replacement.Having short-to-medium length hair, I thought that a smaller size would be perfect.I bought this particular straightener because it was so highly rated. But I returned it the day after I first turned it on. Why? Because it did not heat up properly. I put it on the highest setting because my hair is thick and difficult to straighten, and then promptly forgot about it. When I came back to it half an hour later, it was warm, but not hot. I could touch the ceramic plate with my finger.Needless to say, back in the box it went and my old tired straightener needs to work a bit longer until I can bring myself to try again."
4,Great results,"I'm very satisfied with the results and speed for this flat iron but also found that its pretty easy to burn your fingers when using it because the outside gets a little hot as well. Overall though, nice product for the price."
5,love it,this is a gift for my grand daughter she loves it so much I ordered one more for my other grand darghter
4,Good product,"I like this. It's easy to use and won't make your hair go to flat, just enough to look good but still have a natural overall look.. it heats up pretty fast which has advantages cause you don't have to wait for it to use it but also be careful kinda burnt my finger a week ago due to a little mishandle..But i would definitely recommend it especially for it's price!"
1,Did not like,I have the Andis 1 inch and it has an automatic turn off this does not also to big for my short hair.
2,Doesn't work well for my wife.,"I bought this for my wife, as her's had quit working. She doesn't like it and went out and bought another brand. She said it doesn't glide through her hair and takes much longer to work than her old one or the one she replaced this with."
2,"It worked for awhile, now it just dies quickly.","I have thick curly hair, so I need all the power from my flat iron. This one worked perfectly for a few months, but now it loses heat midway through. If you don't need intensive heat for your hair, then get it. If you need heavy duty heat and longevity, find another iron."
1,Poor,I hat to return this product and get my money back. it dosent heat up good. So it would take me 10x the time to do my hair.
1,Never Worked,I bought this as a Christmas gift. Imagine my surprise when he person I gave it to gave it back because it never worked! And I read up on this product on the Amazon site before I bought it and everybody gave it rave reviews. What a disappointment.
5,Very Nice Flat Iron,"Love this iron. It heats up fast, works very well and light weight. Would highly recomment"
3,Flat Iron,"I am sure the product is a good product, but it is to large and balky for me to use. I will probably use as a gift."
2,works good but did not last nd it died :/,i had bought this straigtner at a store before and loved it. so after like 2yrs i thought i needed a new one so i bought it here. But after like 3 months it died nd stopped working!!-___-
2,Not at all durable,So I bought this about 8 months ago. It was ok at first and then it started going cool when I was only halfway through. The light would stay on but it just wasn't hot anymore. I tried turning it off and on and all sorts of stuff but it would only get hot if I waited awhile. I didn't use it everyday so I could deal with this. Then the gold color started flaking off leaving gold specks in my dark hair. My hair would snag on the edges of the chipped away gold parts. I threw it out. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,great deal,i thought the product had a voltage range but its just for local use..when i used it in INDIA it burnt due to voltage of 240v.but otherwise a great product for the price.
3,"Not impressed, but alright","Iron works well but does not leave my hair silky smooth, like other reviews say. I have thin, fine, wavy hair, but I have to go over it at least twice to get it straight even after blow drying it. Maybe it's the heat protection product, but I don't get the best results. Good for the price and eventually does what it's supposed to do, but I'm not impressed."
1,i wish i never bought this flat iron,"A few years back i got an andis ultra flat iron and it made my thick,curly hair pin straight so i thought buying this flat iron that i would get the same results, i was mistaken cause once u turn it on for a few minutes it heats up then shuts off when it gets too hot i did my hair with it and got frizzy,puffy results, very unhappy with it"
4,Great little flat iron!,"When my last flat iron broke, I wanted a quick, cheap replacement. This one does the job. It is smaller than my previous flat iron, but still straightens my hair well. I have finer hair that is normally pretty straight, I just use the flat iron to smooth it out and get rid of the obnoxious waves near my ears and forehead. My hair does get caught in it, but it doesn't hurt. It gets VERY hot, and I have to be careful with the edge of the flat iron hear my forehead, which was not the case with my last one- I recently got a pretty bad burn near my ear. Great for the price, especially for the light use that I have it for."
5,Works really well!,"I think this flat iron is awesome! It heats up super fast, it straightens my hair well (I have fine hair), and you can't beat the price. I've owned this iron before, and learned that it dies when a baby hits it multiple times on the tile floor, but it lasted quite a long time before that. :)"
4,Excellent,I have thick wavy hair and I love this flat iron. I found that sectioning my hair in thinner sections work best. I like that it has multiple settings. I love this product. I had a babyliss and it doesnt even compare to this flat iron. Love it!
3,Overrated,"I read a lot of reviews that compared this hair straightener to a CHI. After going through two CHIs in one month, I decided to try this straightener out. Unfortunately, I didn't really like it at all. When I set it on a medium heat setting, it would do a horrible job of straightening my hair--it didn't really straighten it at all. When I put it on a higher heat setting, it made my hair look fried. I could see the split ends sprouting out...not to mention my hair got caught in the plates all the time. The highest heat setting doesn't even seem to be very hot at all. I wouldn't recommend this for people which thicker hair. I used this for a week before reverting back to my old straightener."
1,Terrible,This flat iron did not work well on my hair. I have to go over my hair at least 3 times before it is straight but then it is frizzy I was would not recommend to friends.
5,Excellent Product,"I wanted a slimmer flat iron that what i currently have so I purchased this flat iron at Walmart November 25, 2008 for just under $16. To my good fortune, it is an excellent product. It works just as well as my more expensive flat irons. This is a great buy."
3,doable,This flat iron is doable. Is does make my hair straight. If you squeeze it too tight when on your hair it will leave marks so hold it loosely. Otherwise it does what it is supposed to do.
5,Bloody fantastic,"This thing is awesome. I've always shied away from flat irons because I figured they'd take too much time and it wouldn't matter once I stepped outside into the humidity, but not so. I'm so glad I bought this. It takes minutes to do, and my hair stays straight even in humid weather. And it didn't break the bank, either. Love it."
2,Broke down six months after purchase!,"I bought this flat iron back in December and it is now out of service for good... The ceramic plates simply stay cold no matter how long I leave the device on for.Very poor quality, and in the end expensive considering I now have to buy a new iron!"
1,Fine if it works.. mine didnt,"Bought this one and it worked fine for a little less than two months, never mistreated and always well kept, but it decided to die on me. The red light stays on and the green light flashes, it never gets hot, and has now found its way into my trash can. Sorry, I understand these products like everything else have a shelf life, but this one was far too short. Buy elsewhere."
3,just ok,"for $17 this was a fine purchase tho i did expect more from reading the previous reviews. i owned a revlon flat iron before and it became very 'gummed up' with hair product on the ceramic plates. i would have to clean it with a hot, wet cloth to get it off every 5 or 6 times i would use it. im finding that it's pretty much the same with this one. not sure if this is just unique to me but i don't use a lot of hair product (just volume gel at the roots before i blow dry). i was told by my stylist (who suggested i get a chi) that the plates shouldn't get crusty. so, i am content to clean the plates and not have to spend $100 on an iron. at least for now. also, there are enough places where the plastic of the iron connect to the plates that my hair sometimes gets pulled in these creases. i did not have that problem with my revlon as it had nice rounded edges.i have long, straight, fine, color treated hair."
2,Just okay,"This flat iron is nothing to rave about. Yes, it works fairly well and is worth the low price. Just file it under.....""You get what you pay for."""
5,Really nice flat iron,"I bought this for my grown daughter and she loves it. She says it's the best one she's ever owned.It has temperature controls, an on and off switch and comes with a cover you can put it in while it's still hot so you can put it away without worrying it will melt whatever it touches. It heats up fast and has an auto shut-off feature.It was a very good price as well. You really don't have to do further searching. If you buy this, you won't be disappointed."
4,Holds up well,"I straighten my hair almost every day and this has held up well for over a year. For a cheaper straightener, that's great, I think. It gets hot enough to straighten my hair, but doesn't seem to damage it like other tools. I recommend it."
3,3 dollars per month,"I straighten my bangs most days, and this did a good job of that from March through the beginning of September; now the light comes on when I plug it in but it doesn't heat up :(. A 5 out of 25 was plenty of heat, and the 1 inch size was good for super straight and some styling curve towards the forehead as desired.I was pretty careful with it, never dropped it or anything. Occasionally flew with it but always in the carry-on with my laptop and digital camera which still work fine.I am sad this had such a short life, seems hard to get apart or I might try to get in there and see whether it is just a matter of two wires not touching anymore."
3,I loved this at first....,"I liked this straightener a lot, but now the coating on the heating plates has worn off and I've only been using it for three months. I just can't recommend it since that happened."
4,It Works.,"Cheap Looking but it works, I however upgraded to theWein SSHSHS Safe-Sync Hot Shoe to Hot Shoe #W990560becasue it protects the camera body from higher flash trigger voltage of older strobes"
4,Hot Hot Shoe,"The Adorama hot shoe adapter fit perfectly onto my Canon Rebel Xsi hot shoe mount and allowed the flash to fit easily into the slide. I used the adapter with cable to trigger a strobe, and worked equally well with a remote trigger. I would recomend this unit."
5,Works well,It works well. No problems. I use it to get three point lighting with cheap slave flashes. I just connect a pc cable to my camera using this and a pc to hot shoe adapter and trigger the first flash. This triggers two more cheap slave flashes. So I have 3 point lighting with a minimum cost.
1,did i get a different item than everybody else?,"What i got was a Bower SF943 hot shoe adapter that looked just like the photo, with a silver top.I could tell right away that the build quality was not great, as i received two of them, both of which were crooked and left my speedlites at a slant. It literally took 10 minutes to get my Canon 430ex on here, and once I finally did, my flash was disabled completely. I could not even hit the test button to fire a flash. This has never happened to before mounting my flashes on these adapters. Obviously my pocketwizards would not fire, nor would my 580exII which has its own PC, but I was just testing it. That would not test fire either.I will be returning these next time I am in NYC & this has inspired me to look into basic manual flashes with PC built in, as I am just using them as slaves."
5,Look At Geri....No More Ginger,"Geri Halliwell has definatly moved past her ""Ginger Spice"" days. ""Look At Me"" shows of Geri's true vocal talent...and boy...what a talent...her voice is a deep sexy femine voice that needs to be heard..."
5,I think that Geri's new song was a great breakout for her.,"I'm kinda glad that she left the spice girls because that means she has a lot of self- confidence and I think she was one of the better singers. Her new song ""Look at Me"" is great. I love it and think everyone should like it even if they dont like the Geri Halliwell. I also like how in the music video she lets Ginger die and lets her new self come out. I also like her new look and how she lost the huge heels although I sorta liked them. It gives her a more casual look and not so exotic. Especially since she toned down her hair too. It's an altogether great new Geri and song."
3,Look at Geri!,"Geri has proved she doesn't need the Spice Girls to sing a great song! I like the original song, but I hate the remixes. Good work, Geri."
3,This song sounds like the story of her life,"""Look at Me"" doesn't sound like a song. It sounds like a half rap song until you get to the chorus. The lyrics are completely telling her story as a Spice Girl, with the lyrics such as ""loose living,"" ""tight fitting,"" and ""whatcha see ain't what you are getting."" Those lyrics sound like the reasons why she left the Spice Girls, how she wasn't taken seriously with ""superficial expectations."" Well, the song is OK and the lyrics rather unique. The lyrics stray away from those of a typical song, which are lyrics about love. Geri's voice is unique as well, and it sounds fine. This really isn't a bad song. In fact, it's catchy after getting use to the melody and lyrics."
5,It was great!,She is great with and without the Spice Girls. I love the Spice Girls and I think they are doing great without her. And she is doing great without them. This is the kind of break she was looking for and she got it and she is gonna be huge!!!!!
3,Hmmm- not bad for someone who used to be in the Spice Girls.,"I have always hated the Spice Girls more than any other band on Earth, but the other day, just for curiousity, I tried listening to a sound sample of Geri Halliwell's ""Look At Me."" And yet, despite that she used to be in such a horrible band, she's actually pretty good as a solo singer. I find her voice very clear and understanding, and it sounds better with out the ear-splitting voices of all the other Spice Girls. And of course, not only can Geri sing well, but she's also a very beautiful woman! The song ""Look At Me"" is kinda telling guys to look at her beautiful white face and long, shiny red hair. When she sings ""This face is free"", I say, ""Yeah, free and beautiful!"" After all, she DID pose in Playboy about a year ago. But anyway, I recommend you give her a try- She's a lot better than Britney Spears or Tina Turner anyday. GERI, YOU ARE SO HOT, AND KEEP UP THE SINGING!"
4,This one truly stands it's ground!!,"Great bass,swingen lyrics,awesome breakbeats,and all the attitude to say""I'm now a spice""WOMAN""""!!!This title is a great compliment to any club/bar!NOTE:to all good dj's around the world,if you dont have it by now..,search till you find it!!!!marvelous!!"
2,"I wanted to love this watch, but....","This watch had everything I was looking for. A nice big clock read-out, day, date, and most importantly solar and atomic time keeping. Where this watch went wrong for me was with the band itself.After recently purchasing the G-Shock Riseman, I thought I would return it and get this watch instead, hoping I would recoup half of the money I had spent on the Risemen. The only reason I was looking to do the return was because I didn't need, nor planned on using any of the features on the Riseman other than the time and date.Unfortunately, the band on the GW700A is very, very uncomfortable for me compared to the Risemen. The band is almost like a hard plastic rather than a soft comfortable rubber. I couldn't stand wearing it for more than 10 minutes before I had to take it off.Sadly, it's going back to Amazon tomorrow. I really wanted to like this watch but I guess I'll just keep the Risemen as it wears very comfortable."
1,"Weak battery, poor quality","After about a year the battery stopped recharging, the back light switch broke and the back light would randomly turn it's self on through out the night. I liked the features but agree it is only worth $15."
4,Casio Men's GW700A-1V G-Shock Solar Atomic Watch,"It was a gift for my son at Christmas time. It is sturdy watch, durable and elegant for every occasion."
4,A great watch for the money,"I had a very similar model for about eight years, replaced straps and batteries, when it failed this time, decided to go with the same model. I like the big numbers and lack of lots of little windows. I have had the watch a month and hope I continue to have as good sevice as the predecessor delivered. It does everything I need. The atomic feature is a great time saver."
5,Casio G700 Solar Powered Atomic Watch,"This watch provides all the basic functions that anyone would need at a very good value. No batteries to replace, and it's always accurate. What more could one ask for? If you're active in sports, it's even better.Casio Men's G-Shock Solar Atomic Watch #GW700A-1VI have & prefer the GW700A-9V since it has a beige face, and the housing does not have red accents."
4,Nice Watch,"Watch works as advertised. Synchronization keeps it accurate. Easy to read display. Took 1 star off because I think the watch will last longer than the band.... then what.Overall it looks good, and is probably a good rugged watch"
5,This is a Great Watch,"I'm buying 3 more, one for each of my boys. After getting this watch I stopped wearing my Rolex... It just wasn't accurate enough. Put this watch on, forget about it, and you will always have the exact time....What could be better?"
4,Casio's Shock Atomic Watch - Men's,"This is an excellent product and, after finally getting everything set, it's working perfectly. It's also quite attractive. One BIG problem; the directions for setting and using are contained in such a tiny tiny booklet with minute print, that no one could read them! After finally going to the Casio web site we were finally able to bring up a readable copy; however, it would not print in anything but let's-get-out-the-magnifying-glass size. I wouldn't go through that again so guess I'll bypass on a Casio for women!"
1,Wristband was too short - Amazon.com had NO remedy other than to return the watch,"The wristband on the watch was too short to fit around my wrist; in effect, making the watch totally useless.Amazon.com tried to remedy the situation by offering to sell me a replacement wrist band - this is the exact samewristband that is too short to fit around my wrist - in other wordS, no remedy other than to return the watch for a refund.AMAZON.COM NEEDS TO A) SPECIFY LENGTHS OF WRISTBANDS JUST LIKE THEY WOULD SPECIFY THE SIZE OF A SHIRT, ETC.; AND, B) NEEDS TO GET MANUFACTURERS TO OFFER DIFFERING WRISTBAND LENGTHS WITH THEIR WRIST WATCHES THAT ARE FOR SALE...THIS NEEDS TO BE PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED ON THE SAME PAGE THAT TRIES TO SELL THE WATCH TO THE CONSUMER....VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH YOU, AMAZON.COM (High, SeJin)..."
5,"Day of week, month, and date always displayed","Display is larger than other models so I can still read it without glasses. Display of day of week ,month,date and time in base mode is important to me and missing in many of the other models."
2,Not reliable,"Watch will just stop working. I have placed the time peace in the sun for hours just to have the screen go blank in 5 minutes.Functions are good and I like the lay out of features but it just stops.I have had the batter tested and it is good but again..it just stops working.The indicator shows it needs to be charged.Once the operation is resurrected (for reasons know only to the watch)the operation reverts to default setting and the time, date and year need to be reestablished.I would not recommend the watch based on it's frequent failures."
5,Like Attending a Seminar,"The subtitle for this book is ""Life Management Buy the Book."" Reading this is like attending a conference. It is easy to read, filled with practical exercises, thoughtful quotes, and action steps to follow. It begins with a BLE (Balanced Life Evaluation) test to help you see where you stand when it come to personal and family goals. This is more than just time management, it is life management. Each chapter deals with a key area in life showing the power of response, direction, planning, and action. It then outlines what you can do to order your life and maps out the first 40 days. If you need help (and we all do) this book will be a helpful guide."
5,Enforce your rights,"In todays world, it seems creditors no longer have to prove anything in court when they decide to sue, they just get the debtor to admit they owe the debt and the case is done. As a result, credit card company practices have been developed that abuse customers.When consumers try to fight back the inertia of the legal patterns set assume they are the irresponsible party. It is about time we start fighting back and force creditors to prove their cases, and debtors to stand up for their rights. The checks and balances are currently out of balance, this book helps bring them back into balance.Creditors, especially credit card companies are lending irresponsibly, especially after the passing of the 2005 bankruptcy reform bill which took effect in Oct. 2005, that makes it more difficult to get a fresh start from bankruptcy. The political and legal environment makes this book an essential part of any middle-class family's library."
5,Corn4th at his best!,"I have followed Richard throughout the years, with his books and audio tapes. His explanation of third party debt tresspassers is useful ""when applied"". It takes someone with the ability to ""stand up"" first and then just follow the recipe he uses. Almost all debt collectors use the same tactics,,, fruad to collect supposed debts. Know what they (the debt collectors) are doing to you and to all who will not fight back. This book unfortunately only covers what its title says, the rest of the reading is in Richard's other books. Good job Richard! Looking forward to your next books!Dr. Barton"
3,Good,I love this author but I thought the book was kind of predictable. I love Maggie Shaynes writing style. Look forward to reading everything she has out.
3,Worth the read,"Interesting take on good vs evil. The ending feels sort of awkward, not bad, but just sort of like the author had written herself into a corner and had instead of working it out just plopped something out to finish instead of working out a clean ending. Overall a good story, though."
4,A book for iAS Developer,"The use of design patterns in J2EE applications is an exciting new field, adding to the existing wealth of software designs pattern.This book is a for how to:* Install iAS and set up a development environment* Take advantage of the way iAS handles servlets, JSP, and EJBs.* Package applications to make the most of iAS.* Integrate Forte for Java and other IDEs.* Manage application deployment, load balancing, and failover.* Save time and trouble with iAS registry secrets and logging tricks.* Harness the power of SOAP and Web Services.* Make the most of RMI/IIOP.* Implement best practices for everything from automated builds to high availability architectures.This book contains CD-ROM, which features:* Code example from book* Forte for Java, release 3.0.* J2SE 1.4* ICSynergy iPlanet ANT Extensions."
4,"Much better than the help files, but what's not?","I found this book comprehensive in it's treatment of installing the server, integrating your IDE, deploying servlets, JSP's and EJB's. Implementing SOAP and what's happening behind the scenes. All the things that help a developer new to this server to be successful.Unfortunately, most of that could be found (though not nearly as quickly) by diligently searching the awful iPlanet server help documentation. The information this book lacks is the information I wanted from a manual. The down-in-the-trenches advanced help with implementing alternative session control, external load balancing, real-time debugging and the specifics of automated builds. The book briefly discusses these things to indicate they are there, but never gives you the real solutions."
5,Classic Teena Marie,"Like any artist, Teena Marie has been effected by changes in modern music production, but who cares?!! Every track is still classic Teena Marie! She was the first R&B female to rap on an album in the 80's, and she continues to manipulate the mainstream as she wishes, while staying true to the sound that has kept her on the scene for 3 decades. The CD is really good music. Miss T did her thing!"
5,Sapphire CD - Teena Marie,This is a fantastic CD by Teena...I have always loved her music. Her daughter sounds just like her on the last track!
5,Lady T Stuns Again,"LOVE THE ALBUM!!! Lady T's voice is crystal and vibrant on each track. She sings like a bird and the final track with daughter Alia Rose is awesome. The entire album is destined to be classic Lady T. Although most of the tracks are more of the slow jam, all rock with the crystal vocals only Lady T can give. Glad she's back giving us that awesome voice."
3,Pretty Good,"Lady T is still tight. She ain't lost a thing. the vocals,instrumentation&overall production showcase a Soul Sister who is still on her game. dug ""Romantica""&You Blow Me Away"" are Great tributes to the Late Great Rick James. the title cut&Ooo Wee are good tracks. this is a Cool Album&Better than her last Album."
1,shocked & disappointed,what happened? she has a beautiful soulful voice but not this time around. 1 star is too much
2,nope,"""I don't think rocknbluesfan listened to Teena's early albums like Irons in The Fire,It Must Be Magic,Robbery,or Ivory before he wrote his review,or else he probably would have a different opinion of Teena. ""No I wouldn't. Teena is 80's pop. Lots of black females in the 80's sound like white women. Moreover, soul music is about more than just voice... There has to be soul behind it."
1,Don't Buy If You Care About Last Three Tracks,This is my second copy of the CD - the first was returned because the last three tracks could not be played. This CD has the same problem - it looks like cash money records has a manufacturing problem. I won't return this CD again just to get another bad one.
3,"Teena, Teena, Teena","This was a good CD, but Teena has done better. Lots of the songs start to sound the same. I'm still loven a few songs on it but the rest get the skip button. But it has not lost it's place in my CD rotation."
2,Her early albums are better!,"I don't think rocknbluesfan listened to Teena's early albums like Irons in The Fire,It Must Be Magic,Robbery,or Ivory before he wrote his review,or else he probably would have a different opinion of Teena."
2,Oldheadfromwayback,"Sorry, I have to disagree. I was disappointed with this album. I have been a fan since she started. I saw her kick Rick James A-- on stage way, way back there. This album, while it has it's moments (God Has Created is my favorite) seems to pander to the younger crowd much too much. Technically, the music and execution was very well done. But the lyrics convinced me NOT to listen to this again. While I understand the desire to win a new audience and get sales, Teena is NOT a gangster, no matter how she tries to convince you of this. Never has been, never will."
5,Must have for DIYs,"Excellent tool. I use it about the house for home projects all the time. Very accurate. Perfect for one person measurement tasks. Always happy to not have to cope with floppy, droopy measuring tapes. I recommend it."
5,Simple and accurate.,"This really is a handy and suprisingly small device. The laser makes it easy to pinpoint and line up measurements, especially compared to the ultrasonic measurer I have. I've used it so far to measure up the interior of my house for a planned renovation. Trying to take measurements working alone with a tape is a huge pain in the @$$, especially with furniture in the way. I haven't pushed it to the limit as far as working at longs distances or in bright sunlight, but I will soon."
3,"Fat Max - Works, Except in Extreme Cold !","Took Mr. Fat Max to Alaska for a construction job there. Worked pretty good indoors, however, once outdoors at below zero, it just went blank ! I learned to keep Mr. Fat Max, next to the truck's heater, run outside with it inside my coat, shoot a quick measurement and the zip back into the truck.."
4,Handy tool,"I am an appraiser and typically wear out 3 to 5 fiberglass tapes a year measuring houses. I had purchased a sonic measuring device which was pathetically unreliable unless you were measuring a short unobstructed inside corner to inside corner. The laser is a huge improvement in that it gives you pinpoint accuracy for measuring point to point, but don't throw your tape away. The laser is great for certain measurments, but not practical for others. the addition/subtraction feature is really handy. Using the tape and laser together priceless. Probably cuts my measuring time down by 30% to 40%."
3,Not bad.. but sure not for experts....,"C++ is a very complex language, to become an expert in C++...oh man.. u gata do a lot .. this book does not really convay its title..or may be it does by saying that Mr. 'Schildt' is an expert in C++ only up to this books level..In other words.. the book does cover some intresting things.. but... intermiddiate programmers < like me..> already knoiw most of things described.. i thought the book will be elaborating on those topics discussed in the table of contents ... id did not..."
2,Disappointing,"I learned C from Herb Schildt so expected this to be a great book, but it isn't. For example, it's supposed to be an expert c++ book, but the language parser example is proceedural, not object oriented."
3,So-so.,"Tastes differ, obviously. To me, once you get past the exotic name and attractive packaging, there is nothing outstanding about this item, especially given the gourmet price. It is a blend; don't expect Kona taste."
2,Korzybski was there first.,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. It said nothing new, nor did it offer a unique point of view. It was anecdotal without coming to a general conclusion beyond, ""Look how we misuse language."" Korzybski and Hayakawa were talking about the same thing many years ago, and Hayakawa, at least, came up with ideas about how to penetrate the language fog. Her comments were not more insightful than many political commentators. Her biases showed, but that would be no problem if she had offered the reader ways to identify loaded words, to deal with them in conversations, and to avoid the paralyzing effect they have in meaningful discourse."
4,"Texans, Gun Control & a Japanese take on them","Having been born and raised in the Texas that Kawaguchi attempts to capture in his portrayal (done fairly well, IMHO, if a bit stereotyped), I think I can safely say that if Yamaoka really had walked into a Texas bar and given that pitch on gun control, he never would have walked back out again. Well, he would have, but only on a stretcher. Other than that, it's good book, and that ends on a cliffhanger, no less."
4,Great compliation cd from Nik Kershaw,"Great CD of his best hits. Some of the songs I do without, but the rest was a nice blast from the past. I do recommend."
1,I'd be cautious until...,"someone tells us something besides the blah! blah! blah!Not one mention as to which versions of the songs are on here.Especially ""Wouldn't It Be Good"" as no one requested the album or single versions.All requests for that song were for the (promo only) extended version.The music may be good, but the one star rating is really for the so called reviewers."
3,Jon Delerious - No Warning,"Jon Delerious follows in the footsteps of his label, Nordic Trax, and puts out some deep and danceable tech-house. About half of his debut album, No Warning, is dark and full of moody vibes; ""Glow"" and ""Circle Down"" are a perfect example of this. ""No Warning"" and ""Head Flow"" are much warmer, the sort of funky tech-house that we've come to expect, but a few tracks (like ""Tekfunk"" and ""Percussive Slide"") suffer from not enough development. ""Desavibes"" adds some dub textures for variation, and a few tracks add some ethnic instrumentation. It all results in an extremely pleasant, though not outstanding, listen."
3,Band is mostly plastic,"In the photo on the website, the band looked like metal to me. However, the band is actually white plastic with some metal pieces. As long as you realize that, you will probably be happy with the watch, but it wasn't what I expected or wanted. I thought the watch face was easy to read."
2,Hard to read,"The watch is very hard to read. The bezel is white and the numbers are silver. Unless I looked at the face directly from above the numbers were unreadable. Also, the watch is rather thick - it it looks way to big on my arm. I will be returning it."
1,horrible,"i bought this watch for a gift and I was embarrassed to give it after noticing that it was impossible to see the time in the day, farless at night."
1,Display Defective,"The watch was pretty nice, but 1 of the digital numbers was defective.Instead of showing the time as 8:00, it would display 8:0C. I returned the watch and got my money back."
2,I tried to use it wrong.,I thought that I could use it for an emergency sump pump But it would not lift high enough.Easy return!
2,This pump is tiny,I imagine that this pump probably works as advertised but I did not realize that it is tiny.I bought it but never put it into use for various reasons.
4,A Wonderful Read,"Ms. Schaerf's story was amazing. I have never been to Scotland, but now have a desire to go. The descriptions of both setting and character were magical. I enjoyed that there were several romances throughout the story as it kept me turning the pages. I look forward to reading her next novel."
5,THE MOFFATTS RULE!,"Hey everyone! This song totally ROCKED! I especially love the video! It's so much fun to watch! Great job guys!Later-- SoniP.S. If you like the Moffatts, ty listening to Hanson!"
5,The Moffatts Rock!,"If you haven't already bought this you really should buy it now! It's got a kind of Beatles egde to it and its a really cool summer song. If you can get tickets to see them live, then go even if you have to sell your Grandma! Its a shame that it didn't get higher in the British Charts,but you only had to look at the top 10 that week to see how fickle the English Chart is. ~Never knew what music was, Untill I heard this~"
4,Works well but the KVM's case design needs work,"I have been using the KVM for a month and it works flawlessly. The LED indicator is excellent and the switch to change systems is very good. However, the physical case is lacking. It cannot easily or neatly be mounted vertically. The wires project from all sides. The LED indicators are useless if you mount the case under a desk top. If it lays on top of the desk it is not much better than a second monitor. Unfortunately, I have the KVM laying on the floor waiting to break, until I find a better place.Nevertheless, if you need a cost effective and reliable device, this is it."
3,Is just a solution,Is a good solution for having 4 machines and few space on the desk. I am dissapointed in the distribution of the cables. They come and go by all sides. this is really inconvenient if you plan to use the switch button instead of the keyboard key-commands.
1,Won't Work With Wireless,"I bought this unit to replace a D-Link DKVM-2K one because I wanted the four-channel model and because the price was right (you get what you pay for).After disconnecting a D-Link KVM-2 switch (that works flawlessly) and connecting the TK-400K switch, neither of my desktop computers would access my wireless router (D-Link 624) even though my laptop (which I am using now) works perfectly with the wireless router.Trendnet does not have a tollfree number and I have called ten times on my nickle (East Coast to West Coast) and all I get is a recorded message that ""No one is available to take your call"".Stick with a known quantity and buy a D-Link or Linksys unit. I'll try to get my money back from Buy.com."
3,Better than nothing...,"I ordered this based on price when there was a $10 rebate offerred Jan 2006. It was easy to setup and plug in--but there were a few things I didn't think through before ordering.I have an optical mouse (USB) but this switch only supports PS/2. Even with the USB->PS/2 adaptor I had been using with my computer, it was not recognized. So I found my old PS/2 microsoft mouse, but every once and awhile the mouse just stops working. I have to reboot the computer and unplug and replug the connection on the switch. I haven't figured out why or tried to contact customer service yet so there may be a resolution I have not found.For my needs the mouse isn't really important and I have had no trouble with the video or keyboard with 3 different machines (sony from '96, gateway from '99, generic from 2003)."
4,Warranty Made Good - Poor Quality Control?,"The first KVM switch, that I received, failed after a few weeks of use. Very annoying. Amazon made good on warranty and replaced faulty switch at no cost to me. Since then, about a month, the replacment switch has worked just fine.The switches are manufactured in China. My experience suggests poor quality control."
4,Has to be squeezed to make a noise but my dog loves it for fetch,"My dog is insane over some toys that make noise like this that I found at Wal-Mart a few years ago. She has worn them out so I went looking for more. With those ones, all she had to do was shake them and they made noise so she did so constantly.While this doesn't make noise nearly so easily, she still loves it. On these, when the dog squeezes them they make a noise...in this case you hear bubbles coming from the lobster. For a dog with a tiny mouth like a pomeranian, they might carry it by a leg or tentacle and not be able to create a noise but still, when I throw it in a game of fetch and I squeeze it she just goes wild.There is something instinctive about them grabbing something and it making a noise that makes them have crazy fun with these.Of the monkey, frog, and lobster the lobster is her favorite of this brand."
3,Does not last,"Our German Shepard like this, but I was very disappointed that one crunch and it was broken. It would be fine for a smaller dog."
3,Adorable ... Wish it wasn't so fragile!,"My 4-month-old border collie mix LOVES anything that makes noise. The lobster's soundbox is easy to trigger (which is a good thing, so it keeps her attention), and it only makes pleasant little bubbling noises (She also has a Mr. Bill doll, which is cute, but the ""OH NOOO!"" sure gets annoying after a while, so this one's easier to tolerate!).My pup's not too terribly destructive with her toys -- she likes to chew, but generally doesn't rip. That said, even during a tame game of fetch, the little lobster lost a claw and a leg. I try to avoid it for tug of war or fetch now, so she doesn't remove any more limbs.If they'd used plastic thread or fishing line to sew on the limbs (or, even just better stitching!), it'd be the perfect toy for a mild-mannered dog.When this one's destroyed, I'll probably get another, but reinforce the limbs with my own stitching first."
4,"Alot of pieces, but very good instructions","I bought this on Amazon as a Christmas gift for my son. This action playset is a little bit more consuming to put together than other similar playsets, as it took a couple hours with the instructions included. I like that you get all (4) of the key characters in Spiderman 3 movie too. One flaw that stands out with this is the crane detaches easy so it's hard for children to play without the crane falling off several times. So one way to fix this is to super-glu the cranes' base to the top of the tower it sits on. It still turns left/right and operates fine, it just doesn't fall off anymore. Other than that, this is a very durable set."
2,1 MILLION PIECES!!!,THIS THING CAME IN ABOUT A MILLION LITTLE TEENY TINY PIECES!! I THREW IT AWAY WHEN MY 5 YEAR OLD WENT TO SLEEP!!
2,damaged goods,"I was disappointed . The handle had a defect and the magnet didn't line up properly. I was treated horribly from accessorybug and told there wasn't anything wrong with the bag and I shouldn't expect a $2,000 bag quality which I didn't. I will deal with Ebags and Zappos who treat people right from now on."
1,"Not worth it, waste of time.","One should not be getting this product even if it is free of charge. After spending 2 hours trying to get it to work it is still not functioning (I am MS certified software developer by the way). The main issue seems to be software, although overall quality of the remote is low - cheap plastic, low resolution screen, slow response time to name of few. You are better off with your old remote. Customer service of Monster Central is horrible by the way."
1,Clunky monster remote,"After 3 days to set up and a couple calls to tech number, the remote still doesn't duplicate all the functions. Maybe it doesn't work with high end equipment, properly. Software for set-up is outdated and slow."
1,What a piece of c**p!,"Almost impossible to recharge without a lot of effort to get it mounted correctly in its cradle. And after a mere six months, contacts are worn and require some type of liquid interface to get any connection. Of course, the only liquid that works has to have some salinity, which causes the contacts to degrade even more rapidly. Also incredibly difficult to program - bought from Bjorn's in San Antonio, and after two visits and several hours, still not programmed correctly. We hate it! Buy anything else as a controller - you'll be happier."
4,"Pretty good product, I need to get into it more.","This product worked pretty well, it downloaded the appropriate info for my components, and the settings for the various activities worked pretty well. The only thing is, you really want to use this thing exactly the way the software wants to be used. If you want to customize the commands you have to go through this wizard deal and it is not all that intuitive."
1,MonsterMCC AVL300-S,"This remote is so dificult to program that I had to return it and get the URC-MX450.If you are looking for an easy remote to program this is not the one,instead go for the URC-MX450."
2,Monster Remote MCC AVL 300 barely adequate,"Relatively easy to set up using a PC, the performance of the remote has been erratic. After setup, it worked as programmed. Over a matter of a few days however, performance deteriorated. Although using the Help function usually resolves the issue, it gets tedious. One should be able to select an activity and be done with the remote but this is not the case. Users must often follow up to complete portions of the activity chosen. Once the activity is set up, the other functions of the remote such as volume increases, decreases, muting, etc., work as they should and all functionality of the displaced remote controls are emulated on this remote. That is expected so overall, the Monster MCC AVL 300 is below average in performance."
2,Not a great experience,"Remote received and returned! I disliked the boxy feel of the remote. The remote doesn't fit in your hand very well. The LCD display is poor. I had a horrible time getting the Web-based software to communicate with my PC (kept getting ""Unable to Display Content"" error messages). After doing a bunch of Google searches I finally found a solution to the problem and got the software to configure it (required uninstalling and reinstalling the software and creating another account to manage the remote). Final straw however was when the Omnilink RF/IR extender didn't work to control my remote devices.This was my first purchased ever returned from Amazon.com. A+ to Amazon.com on their returns process!"
1,totally frustrated,"Even though it took a few hours to set up properly I was quite happy with it for about 6 months, it then started acting up and loosing functions to the point I had to call tech service several times and was spending hours trying to fix it. I also had problems with the charger not making contact with the remote resulting in having to pamper the remote in the cradle, bleeding the battery down or making the remote completely re-set it self. I finally became so frustrated that I gave up and stopped using it. Not a happy customer!"
4,Owned for 7 months now-I like it.,"Overall, a very good remote...better than good when you consider the price and capabilities versus other, more expensive models. Has the capability to integrate multiple functions into a single button command. Watch TV button turns the set on, to the correct input, turns on the cable box, turns on the stereo and sets to the proper input. The same for DVD, Roku, and other sets of devices. Very versitile. Lighting control is so cool. Features individual control as well as ""theme configurations such as ""all off"" or ""family room all on."" You can control lights, garage door, fans, door locks, thermostat, etc. I have only done lights and fan so far. The down-side: Programming can be copmplicated. But, great telephone support through your computer account. Database lacks some, less-common, devices. I suspect the device database gets updated as new medels come out. Still, not complete though. Z-wave devices (to control with this remote) are not cheap...but they work great."
2,Not-so Universal Remote,"I bought this remote because I lost my Sunfire Ultimate Receiver remote during a recent move. This product uses Harmony's data base, so I thought 'great, I don't have to lay out $300 for an original remote'. The Harmony database showed it was a match for my receiver so I layed out the 80 bucks for Monster AVL 300. Guess what? This is discontinued model. Additionally, the database only has 1/3 of the codes for the receiver (according to their worthless tech support I waited 30 minutes on 'hold' to talk to) they said there is no way to add the missing codes without having a Sunfire remote to manually 'learn' the commands! This remote would probably be OK if you already have the product remote and you're backing up the codes, but if you're buying this remote to replace a missing or broken one, skip it! You're resigned to having lay out big bucks, unless, of course, you find someone with a Sunfire or Theater Grand III remote and they're kind enough to lend it out."
3,Middle 4 way selector button comes off easily,"The tiny 4 way joystick selector button in the middle came off. This is my 2nd one and on both the button came off. On my first one I tried using super glue to reattach it, but that locked the joystick down and it didn't respond anymore, so I had to toss the entire remote. Now I'm just being careful not to let it fall off and loose it...The other buttons are reliable, although the low profile ones take an effort to push down and find. Other than that it is a great deal when compared to the Logitech remotes (which aren't that reliable either). But I wouldn't pay more than a hundred bucks - can't imagine how anyone would pay even close to list price for this...This will work with the Logitech software, but you have to create a new account first. I was not able to transfer the settings from my old Harmony remote (which also had button failure...)."
1,Don't waste your time!!!! It's horrible!,"For as much bragging as they do about this thing, I found it to be over-priced and completely terrible. I had a Logitec Harmony 550 before this and it was a FAR superior remote in every way except the batteries. The AVL300 NEVER worked right and after two days of being disappointed and frustrated (not that I'm not used to that), I THREW IT AGAINST THE WALL. That was the ONLY satisfaction this thing gave me. The software is cumbersome and slow, with unnecessary steps all over the place. You can't set up macro commands to do multiple keystrokes with one button. The backlighting never shut off, no matter how I changed the settings. The ergonomics are terrible. I could not have been less happy with the piece of junk and destroying it was the only thing I enjoyed about it. Long story short: SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,Do not buy this,You better be a rocket scientist to figure this out. 3 night and gave up. No much help from the company called 3 times.
1,A Piece Of Garbage,"I purchased this item almost 6 months ago but never used it. I finally decided to get everything organized and what a frustration. The interface barely works with my PC , I use windows Ultimate and the software from Monster is so archaic it keeps hanging my system. The light won't pair, the omnilink won't pair, customer service non existent , tossed in the garbage. I will try the Harmony 900 or 1100 as I have heard many good things about these."
3,Great alternative,"This was a good alternative for anyone looking for a universal remote but cannot shell out the big bucks for the Logitech series. The remote worked great for about 8 months but then died unexpectedly. Not sure if they make them anymore but after this one died, I purchased a Logitech Harmony One and haven't looked back I have had the Logitech for over a year now and love it."
5,A Must Have,"This is the best remote that I have ever owned. I have tried many universal remotes/learning remotes, and this one blows them all away. It truly can perform any function the original remote can, plus it allows me to hide my components cause it goes through walls. It simplifies complicated functions. With the press of a single button it turns on DVD player, turns TV to right output, and turns AV Receiver to right output. Shipped on time and in great shape. I would buy from here again."
5,awsome remote,"This remote is the best investment, easy to program and operate. We haven't set up the heating or lighting,but all the audio was breeze. Now we can rid the 12 remotes we did have and cache down to one..love,love this remote."
2,Monster MCC AVL300-S Home Theater and Lighting Controller with Omnilink,"Frustrating and difficult to set up with little to no documentation (hard copy, on-line, and information on the CD). Working on it off and on it took me 2 weeks to set it up. Emailed the company for tech support and still haven't received a response. Doesn't appear to be supported by the company anymore. Had to figure it out myself. Worth paying the extra money to purchase a different brand that cost more, but easier to install. In fact, it cost me more in the long run if you factor in my time."
1,Major hassle - does not consistently work,"I have programmed and reprogrammed this device to watch TV, DVR, DVD with a stereo for sound. I choose the radio signal option instead of the infrared and it DOES NOT WORK with any consistency. My family no longer uses it. I have been on the phone with support at Monster. They are nice but the problems do not get fixed. It works for awhile for some things and then other times it just doesn't turn the volume up, turn the TV off, etc.After about 12 hours of time spent on it over a few days, I have come to hate the thing."
3,Contains Serious Errors,"This is a complete book for the Saab 900, but I have found parts that are seriously wrong - i.e. The firing order of the spark plug wires on the distributor - it seems to have an image from the 8 valve engine - not the 16 valve. There are some interesting pages, but fortunately I had a Chilton Imported Car book around or my 900 might still be in the driveway. It might be better a reference book if it were about $10 less..."
1,Sucktacular,I find that this book is nowhere near the quality that you think it would be especially that Brent Wright didn't really wright his portion but Rick Ardini did and has self admitted it.
5,NYC Taxi Cab,I LUV my NYC Taxi Cab / Looks EXCELLENT in my Sports Room !!!! / Constantly Getting Great Comments about it
4,Taxi,"This model is very authentic and impressive, but not very durable for a 7 yr old, which I didn't realize. Two small parts broke off, one when we unpacked it. He loves it anyway."
2,Damaged in transit,The front wheel was damaged in transit--the other wheel didn't look that sturdy. The manufacturer said they didn't have any more of this item and didn't know when they would get it again. Given no other options I requested a refund and received it.
1,Misleading Title,"Lively reading but NOT for youth. If your middle school or high school student is researching Medieval Europe, avoid this book -- it is not what you would assume from the cover. Many scatological and sexual references, all documented with their historical sources. Black and white illustrations. Adults only."
2,Book needs an edit,"The subject is interesting, but as mentioned in other reviews, the author focusses on English history with few European examples. The book is somewhat dry and difficult to read, not because it is an academic treatment, but because it has not been edited. The many ungrammatical sentences require several readings to elicit the meaning. I think it's sad that publishers do not care enough about their books to ensure a decent edit."
1,a film about mistaken idenitdy means this film is a mistake,Not at all a well done thriller boring and rather unclear about a young man`s visit to russia and is mistaken for a killer. Too many loopholes with the plot to be actually taken seroisley. A bad film all the way not worth anything to write about it.
4,Second Last Time is a Charm,"I must admit it, when I was quite younger I was amazed by Allen Ginsberg's work--in fact, it was if Ginsberg stretched his hand to me and welcomed into poetry. In the years that followed, my professors warned me that my taste would ""mature"" out of such 'pop poets', and into 'higher' forms of poetry.I must also admit that this particular book has confirmed my belief that Ginsberg was a poet that may have received his share of attention, but perhaps his share of literary credit is long overdue.In ""Cosmo Greetings"", Ginsberg's second last volume of poetry (the last would be the equally-excellent but posthumous ""Death and Fame"") sees Ginsberg growing older, looking at the world as one small, global community and with more humour than I have read in his work since the early years of ""Howl"" and ""Kaddish"".Give this one a try, and re-establish your love for this man's work."
4,mad bomber hat,"This a a great hat, very comfortable and perfect for Wisconsin's cold winters. I would have given it 5 stars if only the under-chin strap was easier to close."
3,A historiography-geek history,"Hodgkin is a historiography geek with no interest in writing a history of mathematics other than to nitpick about details. Basically, each chapter summarises the conventional story---usually rather scornfully, and too briefly for anyone to gain from it---and then dwells on a myriad of minuscule objections to this version raised by highly specialised historians and published (for a reason, I would say) in highly specialised journals. This piling up of obscure historiographical hypotheses rarely makes a coherent point, let alone does it contribute to any substantial understanding of the history of mathematics."
3,Reasonably priced but not for open outdoors,"I have bought this set a couple of times. It is used out in the open at my lake cottage. It is only outside for 5 months each year so I can get a couple of years out of a set. It would be best suited for a porch or balcony. The trouble is that the covering may be weather-proof, but the frames are wood. They tend to grow mushrooms because the tightly wrapped ""wicker"" holds the rainwater in the wood. Other than that, they are fairly sturdy and comfortable (even without cushions) for the average-sized adult. If you want a set with aluminum frames, which will last longer, you will definitely pay more initially. I will probably buy this set again as my current set is sprouting shelf mushrooms."
4,When Gospel Was Gospel,"I was introduced to Robert Harris and The Soul Stirrers through this album, and followed up with the 2 CD set ""He's My Rock"", see my review. On this album of When Gospel Was Gospel, #5 is mislabeled, giving credit to ""The Roberta Martin Singers, for the song ""Yield Not To Temptation"", which is definitely done by Robert Harris and The Soul Stirrers. I have played the first 6 songs of this album, over and over, for much comfort, as they are so beautiful. Also a close second are #8,9,13,14 and 15!Sincerely,Bob McKenney"
2,Not the Best,I didn't care that much for this one at all. The sound was terrible....I will just give it away to someone.
3,Not horrible,"I bought this to get into better shape for our season and it's pretty good. A lot of the drills and info you can just find on youtube or google it, but the book has a few informative chapters. For the price, this is a good deal."
1,horrible,"This book is written on a psychology level, and not on the average level of reading if you are seeking to gain insight on the borderline personality."
4,Great product,My mother loved it. Was professionally written and gave a great overview of the subject at hand without being too technical.
5,Very informative,We have learned a lot from this book. Its easy reading and very comprehensive. Good for bible study.
4,Dramatic hip hopppppp,"This is electronica, they sound a lot like Spore, mixing up old sounds like classic sounds of people saying, ""Ladies and Gentlemen. Your attention please."" Classic songs remixed, like Que Sera. Some are very short/interludes. Short songs are 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 18(1.) This is an intro. Weird talking. ""Where is the tailor? Just tell me where he is!"" (2.) !!!!!! This is a remix of Que Sera, infused with old men's voices from maybe the '50's, it is a great song. This song is good for everyone, whether you like classic movies, classic rock, or electronica. (3.) !! This is entirely jazzy hip instrumental except for the first part.(5.)!!! Hypnosis theme. Very mellow and dramatic.(9.) Good, mellow and slow like their other stuff. FYI 6 minutes long.12!!!!. Charlotte Savory does a great job on this. This is like the score to"
5,Quite possibly my favorite album of all time,"I don't say that lightly. I am a huge music fan. This is ""Dark Side of the Moon"" for the electronica generation. Grab your buds and listen to it all the way through. Headphones are worth it.Enjoy!"
2,True to life story but where's the ending????,"Berenstain Bears First Time Books usually touch upon some true to life problem that children encounter in their lives. The stories end with some meaning, helpful solution or an understanding that maybe it's not really a big problem. ""Mad, Mad, Mad Toy Craze"" does neither of these. The story is true to the Beanie Baby craze but there is no solution or even an understanding at the end. My children and myself were for the first time truly confused and disappointed with an ending of a Berenstain Bear book. If the goal of the book was for the children to come up with better ending to this story, then we succeeded. I will still continue buying this series but I will not recommend this book to anyone."
5,The Berenstain Bears lean an important lesson about market bubbles,The Barenstain bears learn an important lesson about market bubbles. If only the folks at Lehman Bros. had read this book!
5,great book,Nice little book The bear collection is timeless as ussually and geat lessons for all to learn and talk to your kids about.
1,disappointment from such a great IM,"Like the reviewer ""Kid's review"" I say that S.P. does not fulfil what she promises to do: teaching.She names the opening, gives a very brief point about it and passes to another opening in the same manner.None of the priciples of planning are ever envisaged.There's some improvement in the endgames section, but not enough to justify the high price you pay to have some advice -even at GM level (If I had to pay for GM level, I would require GM level tuiton).If you have the book ""Modern Chess Openings"" by Nick Firmian, you'll find far more esplanations in that reference book than in Ms Polgar's DVD.Sorry Ms Polgar, I cannot recommend anyone, even a beginner, to buy this DVD for lack of explanation.If you say that you are going to show ""How to plan games"" then indeed you must show how to. This is lacking from the DVD.Not a teaching good buy."
3,"Fast examples, light on theory","Susan Polgar is unquestionably one of the grandmasters of chess. Her understanding of the game and her demonstrated expertise in tournament play are nothing short of awe-inspiring. This DVD, however, would probably be of most use to extremely experienced players. I have played for years, but not terribly seriously and have lately wanted to improve my game. Examples from very famous games are provided in this DVD, often with the pieces moving extremely rapidly and without full explanation of the thinking involved. To state the generality, there is less explanation of the principles than I would have liked. I felt like I saw great examples of play, but did not have the principles and theories behind the moves adequately explained. That may indicate my lack of experience at the very serious level, but I think it will be a common experience for those of us who have not passionately studied the game as yet."
3,Heat up,The camera does heat up when attached to the charger.I complained to Cannon support about the camera getting hot enough to the point that you cannot touch it.They didnt know anyhting about it (even though the manual that came in the box does point out issues with reaching optimal temperature).I returned it after a week.Although I should say that it is a very slim/light camera and does have a superb video quality.If it wasnt for the battery/charging I would have kept it
1,"Used to love it, now I hate it","When I bought the unit, I loved it. Then after recording many items onto a disk, the disk became unreadable. Oh, my first use of memorex media. I switched back to old reliable TDK. Nope. It wrote a whole disk of recordings, but cannot reliably read them, nor can I transfer them to a computer or play the disk on a DVD player. It stoped working, was expensive, is not that old, and I don't know what to do."
1,"Good Camera, Crappy Software","This is a nice little camera, and the video quality is excellent. However, I cannot recommend it because the video editing software is from Roxio. Canon clearly states that they do not provide product support for the software. Roxio also avoids supporting the software - if you have a problem, they will allow you to call tech support for $40, or they will kindly sell you an upgrade for $39.95. I have been trying, unsuccessfully, for 6 weeks to get an unlock code from them to allow me to use the software. For some reason, when I installed the software and registered it as instructed, I never received back an unlock code, so the software is useless. Roxio obviously made a piggyback deal with Canon in order to force people into buying their ""upgraded"" product. Roxio simply ignores e-mails."
3,We bought this new,"We bought this camcorder for our recent trip to Cancun. I have to say it isn't very user friendly. You cannot take still shots unless you have the mini sd card, which I still have been unable to find but the video works nicely using small dvds. Overall it may not be the best for people that find electronics a little complicated but if you have the time to sit and read the book from front to back it should come easy to you."
1,This camera stinks,I got this camera for my birthday and recorded some very important footage of my daughters graduation. I have not been able to transfer the movies to either another disc or my computer since. The software provided gives me nothing but error messages and Canon says it is a Roxio issue and Roxio won't even talk to you without a $40 technical support fee. I have to return the camera and I am stuck with a disc that I can only watch on the camera which I will no longer have. This camera is the worst camera I have ever owned.
3,Few good chapters,"There are only few books available on the subject (which comes at no surprise, as people who know how to write such a book would get tons of money just applying these methods, rather than writing a book). Chapters on basic consepts are worth reading, looks like the author knows what he is talking about. It includes intermarket analysis, seasonal trading and trading using technical indicators. More advanced subjects, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, machine learning, statistics and others are very weak. Look somewhere else if you want more info on this."
2,Cybernetic trading?,The only value this book has is in the section on cycles. I ordered some of the software designed by Ruggero in order to run a few of the studies discussed in the book. I rapidly lost faith in it's contents after learning that my order taker on the other end of the phone line was Ruggerio himself. Why would any succesful trader who purports to have designed systems producing millions of dollars also work as an operator?
2,Rocket science,"There are some very interesting concepts in here, but I doubt that they will enhance your bottom line. Of course these systems are profitable (they're backtested), but by how much? Simpler systems will probably do better, I know basic volatility systems will. Maybe all the tests should have been run with a moving average crossover system as a base line?There are many intermarket relationships, but I feel they are better used as a general guide, not hard and fast rules to trade another market.Some of the concepts are hard to understand even for the mathmatically inclined. Does trading need to be this difficult? No, not for these returns.Unless you are looking for something specific that he covers here, there are better books out there."
1,Red Alert! Serious brain shortage condition ahead,"Anyone who refers to Larry Williams as a legendary trader is either completely stupid or a complete liar or both. Murray is a complete marketer and hype artist. Anyone who says he is not has obviously never even picked a trading magazine. With the passing of every 3 or 4 issues we can read Murray's brand new ads. ""Make millions of dollars"", ""Supercharged adaptive indicators"" and so on. I am only paraphrasing here but you get my point. I think I am going to call up the Quantum fund right now and see if I can speak with George Soros. Or maybe I will call up Caxton corp and ask to speak with Bruce Kovner.Hey maybe they will give me some free consulting time with them if I buy some of their indicators. Real traders trade!!!!"
2,Verbose,"I found this book throughly boring, filled with trying to computerize and mathematically analyze everything rather than working on simple rules and setups. This would be most beneficial to a backtest programmer/trader in learning the process of system development. As a whole, most traders will learn little usable (or new) information from this book."
1,"Obvioulsy, reviews have been written by the authors friends",What in the world are these other reviewers talking about. Must be the author reviewing her own work or her friends. This book just talked about basic training. it gave no special survival tactics or any way of succeeding more than the other recruits. I found nothing at all special about this book.
1,Buy this if you want to waste your money!!,"I was very, very disappointed with this product. It's completely useless!! It's equivalent to putting warm water in a plastic cup. What a rip off!!"
1,Portable Steam Therapy,This item is not worth the money spent on it. You can not use boiling water and the steam does not last any time at all. You do better heating water in a cup in the microwave and breathing that steam. You can put the Vicks strips or whatever in your cup of water. This is not a good product in my books. Thanks.
1,Just a glorified paper cup!,"The name is very misleading -- there is NO STEAM! This is not electric or battery-operated. You simply pour in hot tap water (you can't even use boiling water!), which doesn't do one bit of good. I have had much more therapeutic results from sitting over the warmth of a bowl of soup or cup of coffee.Do not buy this ridiculous product!"
1,Seriously?,"Who came up with this? What a POS. DO NOT buy this product; in fact, don't even take it for free. You're better off sticking with the old head-over-a-bowl-of-boiling-water method. I feel like such a shmuck for buying this worthless plastic cup."
1,"No steam whatsoever, not very useful - waste of money in my opinion","I didn't buy mine at Amazon - instead at a Walgreens because I was desperate for SOMETHING portable that I could use at work, but that didn't bother the others I work with (we work in an open space). Even when I ignored the recommendation of using only hot tap water and put very hot water that I microwaved in it, it produced no steam. Using it with hot tap water is useless, even with the vapor packet in the water. A complete waste of money - I was pissed when I tried it at work and discovered it was useless. I got more comfort from breathing the steam in a large coffee cup full of boiling water. Do not buy this product."
